15 November 2021

### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## Background

1       The accused, Mr Sheikh Parvez Zunuas bin Shaik Raheem, a 40 years’ old male Singapore citizen had pleaded guilty to the following charges:

1 st Charge

> are charged that on 13 October 2019 at or about 11.07 am, along Changi Airport Terminal 4 Arrival Drive, Singapore, did drive a motor car SKJ2596B when you were under disqualification from holding or obtaining a driving license for all classes of vehicles, to wit, you had been disqualified by a Judge of the State Court, Singapore, from holding or obtaining a driving license for all classes of vehicles for a period of 24 months with effect from 10 October 2019 to 9 October 2021, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 43(4) of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276.

2 nd charge

> are charged that you, 13 October 2019 at or about 11.07 am along Changi Airport Terminal 4 Arrival drive, Singapore, did use motor car, SKJ2596B, whilst there was not in force in relation to the use of the said vehicle by you, such a policy of insurance or such a security in respect of third-party risks that complies with the requirements of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Chapter 189, 2000 Rev Ed) and you have thereby contravened Section 3(1) of the Act punishable under Section 3(2) and Section 3(3) of the Act.

2       The accused was first charged in court for the present offences on 23 September 2020. The matter was subsequently adjourned on nine occasions pursuant to three representations made by Defence Counsel and for police investigations into the representations to be completed.

3       On 31 August 2021, after the Prosecution maintained its position to proceed against the accused as charged, he pleaded guilty to the two charges and admitted to the Statement of Facts without any qualification. On 29 October 2021, after considering the accused’s written plea in mitigation and the Prosecution’s submissions on sentence, I sentenced the accused as follows:

4       The accused being dissatisfied with my decision had filed his Notice of Appeal against my sentence and order of disqualification on 29 October 2021. He is presently on bail pending the hearing of his appeal. He has paid the fine of $600 imposed for DAC 918342-2020. As there was no application for a stay of the disqualification order in respect of this charge, the order is effective from 29 October 2021.

5       Having set out the background for the present case, I now provide the reasons for my decision.

## Salient Facts

6       The complainant is Tng Xun presently attached to the LTA.

7       The accused, a male Indian aged 39 years and a Singapore Citizen was the driver of motor car, SKJ2596B, at the material time of incident.

8       On 13 October 2019 at about 11.07 am, the accused was driving a motor car, SKJ2596B along Changi Airport Terminal 4 Arrival Drive. On screening, the accused was found driving whilst under disqualification.

9       Investigations revealed that the accused was driving the said motor car, SKJ2596B when he was disqualified by the State Courts of Singapore from holding or obtaining a driving licence for all classes of vehicles for 24 months with effect from 10 October 2019 to 09 October 2021.

10     At the material time, there was therefore no policy of insurance or security in respect of the Third-Party Risks as complies with the requirements of the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Act Chapter 189, in relation to the use of the said motor van by the accused.

11     The accused has also contravened Section 3(1) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risk and Compensation) Act (Chapter 189, 2000 Rev Ed) and thereby committed an offence under Section 3(2) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation Act (Chapter 189, 2000 Rev Ed), which is punishable under Section 3(2) rear with Section 3(3) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risk and Compensation Act (Chapter 189, 2000 Rev Ed).

## Sentencing

### Prescribed Penalties

12     The prescribed penalty for a first offender under s 43(4) of the Road Traffic Act (“RTA”) is a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both. Pursuant to s 42(1) of the RTA, as the offence is in connection with the driving of a motor vehicle, the Court shall order the offender from holding or obtaining a driving licence for life or for such period as the court may think fit.

13     The prescribed penalty for an offence under s 3(1) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risk and Compensation) Act (“MVA”) is fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months or to both. S 3(3) of the MVA provides that a person convicted of an offence under this section shall be disqualified for holding or obtaining a driving licence under the RTA for a period of 12 months from the date of the conviction or to a longer period of disqualification unless there are special reasons not to make the order.

### Antecedents

14     On 10 October 2019, the accused was convicted in Court 21 for an offence of drink driving under s 67(1)(b) of the RTA. He was sentenced to a fine of $3,000 in default 12 days imprisonment and disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 24 months with effect from 10 October 2019.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

15     The Prosecution sought a sentence of at least six weeks’ imprisonment with 48 months’ disqualification for all classes of vehicle for the offence under s 43(4) of the RTA charge and a fine of $600 with 12 months’ disqualification for all classes of vehicles for the offence under s 3(1) of the MVA.

16     It was submitted that there were no exceptional circumstances to warrant a departure from the usual custodial sentence imposed for an offence of driving whilst under disqualification. It was also submitted that it was an aggravating factor for the accused to have driven shortly after being disqualified.

### Defence’s Submissions on Sentence

17     In his written plea in mitigation, apart from providing the accused’s personal background, Defence Counsel Mr Rajwin Singh Sandhu had set out the circumstances leading to the present charges. It is relevant to note that the written plea in mitigation had only addressed the appropriate sentence to be imposed for the s 43(4) of the RTA charge and was silent on the s 3(1) of the MVA charge. I further noted that there were no submissions on the appropriate disqualification period or whether any special reasons existed for the disqualification order not to be imposed for both these charges. Hence, it is puzzling that there is also an appeal against the disqualification order.

18     According to his Counsel, on 10 October 2019 after the accused had pleaded guilty and was sentenced, he was informed by a ‘Court Facilitator’ to hand over his driving licence at the Traffic Police in one week’s time. After he surrendered his licence, he was not allowed to drive. As such, as the accused was under the genuine impression that the last day he could drive was on 17 October 2019, he drove his car and only started to advertise to sell it on the day after the last day he believed he could drive _ie_ 18 October 2019.

19     It was submitted that if the ‘Court Facilitator’ had not informed him that after he surrenders his licence in one week’s time he is not allowed to drive, the accused would not have driven his vehicle. Prior to being misinformed by the ‘Court Facilitator’, the accused believed that the last day of his driving would be after the conviction. The accused surrendered his driving licence seven days later and he stopped driving.

20     His Counsel further submitted that there was objective and contemporaneous evidence to show that he was acting under the misinformation in relation to the charges preferred on him. In support of this assertion, the accused relied on WhatsApp exchanges between the accused and his former girlfriend as well as the WhatsApp Groups exchanges where he advertised/posted the sale of his car on 18 October 2019.

21     In addition, his Counsel had enclosed his cautioned statements to the police in respect of the present charges in support of his assertion that he was labouring under a mistaken belief where he indicated that he wished to write to the Attorney-General’s Chambers to plead his case and be given a stern warning.

22     It was the Defence’s case that the facts of the present case presented a unique situation as he was unaware of the disqualification being in force. It was submitted that it was a mitigating factor that the accused was driving under a mistaken belief. It was submitted that his defence that he was misinformed about the date of disqualification had been investigated and was not challenged by the Prosecution. It was submitted that as the accused’s culpability was low, a fine of $2,500 should be imposed.

23     As I was concerned about the serious nature of the allegation made by the accused that he was misled by a ‘Court Facilitator’ who was in fact a Court interpreter, I informed the parties that from the court records the drink driving charge was first read to the accused in English on 8 August 2019. I highlighted that the offence and the prescribed punishment would have been explained to the accused including the fact that for an offence under s 67 of the Road Traffic Act, the disqualification takes effect from the date of conviction or when the offender is sentenced to imprisonment, from the date of release from prison. I emphasized that when the judge pronounces the sentence, the effective date of the disqualification would be pronounced in open court.

24     After being informed of the above, the accused shifted his position and orally claimed that he did not recall being informed about the portion of the sentence of when the disqualification starts. His Counsel then suggested that ancillary hearing be held as to whether the accused had indeed heard that portion of the order. His Counsel also indicated his intention to apply for the judge’s minute sheet for 10 October 2019. As I did not think that an ancillary hearing was appropriate, I reminded that he was an officer of the court and that he should be careful in making serious assertions about the court processes. The matter was adjourned to 29 October 2019 for his Counsel to take the accused’s instructions and to advise him accordingly.

25     On 26 October 2021, the Defence filed an affidavit by the accused essentially repeating what was set out in the plea in mitigation. He had also provided the background of what had transpired during his previous court mentions for the drink driving charge. In particular, he attested that he only remembered the judge pronouncing his sentence as $3,000 fine and 24 months disqualification. The Court records in relation to the accused’s previous drink driving charge together with the Certificate under s 45A Evidence Act was also exhibited in his affidavit.

#### Prosecution’s Reply

26     The Prosecution submitted that the matter had gone through several rounds of investigations with regards to the Defence’s assertions and their findings revealed that the assertion was not borne out. It was further submitted that driving right after the disqualification was an aggravating factor.

27     It was highlighted that the language used by the accused during the proceedings was English and that there should be no confusion in him hearing the sentence that was pronounced by the judge directly from the microphone.

## My decision on sentence

### Sentencing principles

#### s 43(4) of the RTA

28     General and specific deterrence are the sentencing consideration when dealing with offences under s 43(4) of the RTA (_PP v Lee Cheow Loong Charles_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 961</span> and _Muhammad Saiful bin Ismail v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 1028</span> (“Muhammad Saiful”). Deterrence is an important principle that underlies our sentencing jurisprudence and it is directed at keeping crime rates in check (_PP v Tan Fook Sum_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 1 SLR(R) 1022</span> at \[18\]). General deterrence aims to educate and deter other like-minded members of the general public by making an example of a particular offender (_Meeran bin Mydin v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 1 SLR(R) 522</span> at \[9\]). It is an especially weighty consideration where premeditation is present (_PP v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> at \[22\]) or where it is difficult to detect the crime in question (_PP v Law Aik Meng_ at \[25(d)\]).

29     Driving whilst under a disqualification order is a strict liability offence. This was held by the High Court in _Chng Wei Meng v PP_ \[2002\] 2 SLR (R) 581 (“Chng Wei Meng”) at \[19\] and affirmed in _Muhammad Saiful_ at \[23\]). As such, the mere act of driving under a disqualification order is all that had to be proven for the offence to be made out: See \[23\] of _Muhammad Saiful_. In that case, Sundaresh Menon CJ had considered some specific types of mitigating and aggravating factors namely:

> (a)     Knowledge of the disqualification order;

> (b)     Intentional and flagrant breaking of the law;

> (c)     Length of time from expiry of the original disqualification order;

> (d)     Weight of surrounding circumstances.

30     Furthermore, driving under a disqualification order is considered a serious road traffic offence. Yong Pung How CJ said in the case of _Chng Wei Meng v PP_ \[2002\] 2 SLR (R) 581 at para \[43\]:

> Driving while under disqualification is about as serious an offence as a motorist can commit. Not only does it compromise the safety of our roads; it also creates problems in ensuring adequate compensation for luckless victims.

31     The usual benchmark sentence for driving under disqualification under s 43(4) of the RTA is four to eight weeks’ imprisonment for a first offender as held by the High Court in _Fam Shey Yee v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGHC 134</span> at \[12\]:

> …It is also not disputed that the sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment meted out in the present case falls within the usual tariff of four to eight weeks’ imprisonment: see: _eg_ Public Prosecutor v Tan Chen Chey <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGDC 485</span>; Public Prosecutor v Choo Puay Lan <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGDC 64</span>; Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Fazil bin Azman <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGDC 168</span>; Public Prosecutor v Lian Chee Yeow Michael <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGDC 190</span>; and Public Prosecutor v Tan Thiam Soon <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGDC 228</span>.

#### Knowledge of disqualification order

32     In the present case, the Defence had urged the Court to impose a fine of $2,500 as it was a mitigating factor that the accused was driving under a mistaken belief. In my view, the accused person’s mistaken belief that his disqualification only commenced seven days after his conviction on 10 October 2019 could only be regarded an exceptional circumstance if it was both innocent as well as based on reasonable grounds.

33     It is undisputed and reflected in his own plea in mitigation that the accused was aware that the disqualification order would start from the date of conviction from the time the s 43(4) RTA charge was first read to him and on 10 October 2019 when he pleaded guilty.

34     In passing sentence, the judge had pronounced the fine imposed and the disqualification order made including the effective date of the order in his presence. This is also evidenced by the Certificate under s 45A Evidence Act that the accused had exhibited in his affidavit. Furthermore, the sentence for the drink driving charge has not been set aside as no appeal was filed. Under these circumstances, it cannot be said that he was unaware that the disqualification order was in force.

35     I agreed with the Prosecution that it was inconceivable that the accused was confused or only heard part of the sentence and not the commencement of his disqualification order if his sentence was pronounced in English amplified by a microphone and directed at him.

36     It was unbelievable and illogical that the accused could shortly after, confuse the commencement of the disqualification order with the seven days deadline for him to surrender his driving licence as they were clearly two separate matters. If he was indeed confused, he could have sought clarification directly from the Court that had passed the sentence. In my view, it was more likely that the Court interpreter had reminded him not to drive after his conviction as he had been disqualified and that he was to surrender his driving licence within seven days. Hence, based on the facts before me, I did not find that his mistaken belief was both innocent as well as based on reasonable grounds.

37     I did not think that the WhatsApp exchanges between the accused and his former girlfriend as well as the WhatsApp Groups exchanges where he advertised/posted the sale of his car on 18 October 2019 corroborated his claim of mistaken belief. It was clear from his own messages that he was aware that he would not be able to drive after his conviction in his earlier messages. The fact that he only advertised his car on 18 October 2019 was not supportive of his claim that he could not drive after 18 October 2019 as by 13 October 2019 he was found driving whilst under disqualification by the LTA officer.

38     In my view, his claim of mistaken belief was borne out of desperation and was a contrived effort on the part of the accused to avoid the consequences of his actions when he was stopped on 13 October 2019. Hence, I rejected his claim that it was a genuine mistaken belief as it was neither innocent nor based on reasonable grounds.

#### Length of time from expiry of the original disqualification order

39     The accused had been disqualified from driving for a period of 24 months for all classes of vehicles from 10 October 2019. His period of disqualification would have ended on 9 October 2021. I agreed with the Prosecution that the fact that he was stopped three days after being convicted and disqualified from driving is an aggravating factor.

40     Based on the above and as there were no exceptional circumstance that warranted a departure from the imposition of the usual custodial sentence, I was of the view that a custodial sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment for the s 43(4) RTA charge was fair and justified.

#### Disqualification order

41     As observed by Sundaresh Menon CJ in _Muhammad Saiful_ at \[18\] a disqualification period shorter than the original disqualification period would do little to deter future like-minded offenders. It is an important punitive element for offences of drink driving and under s 43(4) of the RTA. He further observed at \[19\] that a disqualification order also prevents these offenders from driving and endangering themselves and other road users. The imposition of another, longer disqualification period would help ensure that such drivers are kept off the roads for a longer period of time.

41     In view of the above, I was of the view that a disqualification order for a period of 48 months for all classes of vehicles was necessary both as a form of specific and general deterrence. A disqualification order that is twice the original order is also necessary as a form of punitive element in the present case in view of the aggravating circumstances in the present case.

### S 3(1) of the MVA

42     The sentence for an offence under s 3(1) of the MVA for a first offender is usually a fine ranging from $600 to $800 and the mandatory disqualification for a period of 12 months from the date of the conviction or to a longer period of disqualification unless there are special reasons not to make the order.

43     The meaning of “special reasons” was considered by the High Court in the cases of _Muhammad Faizal bin Rahim v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 116</span> and _Prathib s/o M Balan v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1066</span>. The High Court held that the phrase “special reasons” has a narrow meaning. Only reasons connected to the offence and not reasons related to the offender are to be considered.

44     In _Sulaiman bin Mohd Hassan v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 132</span>, Tay Yong Kwang JA affirmed the fine of $700 and disqualification order of 12 months from the date of conviction imposed by the trial judge on appeal. In the present case, as the accused had pleaded guilty to the second charge, I was of the view that a sentence of $600 and disqualification order of 12 months from the date of conviction was just and appropriate in the circumstances.

## Conclusion

45     The accused was aware that the disqualification order for his drink driving charge commenced from the date of conviction _ie_ 10 October 2019. His offences were discovered when he was stopped for screening by an LTA officer when he was driving along Changi Airport Terminal 4 Arrival Drive. This present case serves to illustrate the difficulty in detecting such offences under the RTA and the MVA and the need to impose deterrent sentences as part of the Court’s sentencing consideration.
