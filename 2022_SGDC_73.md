### Principal District Judge Victor Yeo Khee Eng:

## Introduction

The Accused, Low Eng Pah, 61 years old, pleaded guilty to three charges comprising of two charges of illegal remote betting under section 8(1) of the Remote Gambling Act (RGA) 2014 (Act 34 of 2014); and one charge of abetment by engaging in a conspiracy to voluntarily cause hurt to one Melvin Tan Keng Meng (“the victim”), an offence punishable under s 323 read with Section 109 of the Penal Code (PC) (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008).

2       Upon his conviction, the Accused admitted and consented to another two charges of illegal remote betting under section 8(1) of the RGA 2014 to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

3       The Accused was sentenced to a fine of $5,000/- in default 5 weeks' imprisonment per charge for the RGA charges, and eight (8) months’ imprisonment for the s 323 read with s 109 of the PC charge. The aggregate sentence imposed was **eight (8) months’ imprisonment and a total fine of $10,000/- in default 10 weeks’ imprisonment**. The fine of $10,000/- has been paid in full. The Accused being dissatisfied with the sentence of imprisonment imposed for the PC charge filed an appeal against his sentence. He is on bail pending appeal.

4       These are the grounds for the sentences imposed.

## Statement of Facts

6       The Statement of Facts (SOF) which the Accused admitted without qualification, are as follows:

> 1.    The Accused is Low Eng Pah, a 61-year-old Singaporean male bearing (date of birth: 19 January 1960).

> **Facts relating to the 5th charge (DAC-907759-2020)**

> **A**.     **Parties**

> 2.    The victim is Melvin Tan Keng Meng (Male / 44 years old at the material time) (“**Melvin**”).

> 3.    The co-Accused persons are as follows:

>> a.    Khoo Tsu Peng, a 67-year-old Singaporean male (“**Khoo**”);

>> b.    Mohamed Hussain Shah Bin Abdullah, a 46-year-old Singaporean male (“**Hussain**”);

>> c.    Muhammad Nurhan Imada Bin Zakaria, a 20-year-old Singaporean male (“**Nurhan**”);

>> d.    Muhammad Kamal Ruzaman Bin Abdul Ghafar, a 25-year-old Singaporean male (“**Kamal**”); and

>> e.    Zainudin Bin Hassan Mohamed, a 51-year-old Singaporean male (“**Zainudin**”).

> **B**.     **First Information Report**

> 4.    On 24 February 2020, at around 4.29 pm, the Police was notified that two male individuals had assaulted another male individual who was bleeding as a result of the assault. The attackers were seen wearing a helmet. The incident location provided was Blk 529 Hougang Avenue 6, Singapore 530529 (“**the incident location**”).

> **C**.     **The offence**

> 5.    The Accused became acquainted with Melvin in early 2015 through a mutual friend. In April 2018, the Accused got into a dispute with Melvin over gambling winnings. Thereafter, Melvin cut contact with the Accused.

> 6.    Subsequently, in June 2019, the Accused became good friends with Khoo. They met frequently for coffee at Blk 169 Lor 1 Toa Payoh, Singapore 310169 (“**the Toa Payoh coffeeshop**”). The Accused shared with Khoo his dispute with Melvin. Khoo suggested hiring someone to assault Melvin to teach him a lesson and recover back his gambling winnings. The Accused agreed and promised to give Khoo 40% of the gambling winnings.

> 7.    Sometime in January 2020, Khoo introduced Hussain to the Accused for Hussain to assault Melvin and teach him a lesson. Hussain accepted the job. A few days later, the Accused and Khoo visited the incident location several times to study the movements of Melvin. On one occasion, they were accompanied by a friend, Chan Weng Hoong Eric (“**Eric**”). Khoo also visited the incident location with Hussain to point out Melvin to Hussain. After discussing with the Accused, Khoo told Hussain when to carry out the assault on Melvin.

> 8.    At the material time, Hussain was on court bail for his other offences and Khoo was his bailor. Hussain was a senior member of the ‘Omega’ Secret Society of the ‘Independent’ Group (“**the Secret Society**”). Hussain told Khoo that he did not want to carry out the attack himself because he was on Court bail. As Khoo was his bailor, he understood. Hussain decided to get younger members of the Secret Society to attack Melvin. Hussain recruited Kamal and Nurhan, who were fighters of the Secret Society to physically attack Melvin in exchange for monetary compensation. Hussain also introduced them to Khoo.

> 9.    Hussain hired Zainudin to transport Kamal and Nurhan to and from Melvin’s location. At the material time, Zainudin was the driver of a private ambulance bearing registration no. SKX8298Z (“**the ambulance**”). In this connection, Hussain informed Zainudin of the impending attack on Melvin by Kamal and Nurhan.

> 10.    In early February 2020, the Accused met Khoo at the Toa Payoh coffeeshop. Khoo showed the Accused the ambulance and explained that the ambulance would ferry two of Hussain’s “hitmen” to carry out the attack on Melvin.

> 11.    In the afternoon of 24 February 2020, the Accused drove Khoo and Eric to the incident location. Khoo said that he was planning to “ambush” Melvin. Thereafter, the Accused returned home. At around the same time, Zainudin picked Nurhan and Kamal up in a private ambulance and drove them towards a coffeeshop in the vicinity of the incident location to execute the attack on Melvin. Khoo and Hussain were also at the incident location keeping surveillance on Melvin. Khoo called Nurhan to inform him of Melvin’s exact location at the incident location and the details of his attire at the material time.

> 12.    Before alighting from the ambulance, Nurhan and Kamal wore motorcycle helmets to conceal their identities. Nurhan and Kamal had planned to bring the motorcycle helmets along prior to the attack. They then made their way towards Melvin’s location.

> 13.    At around 4.29 pm, Melvin was sitting alone on a chair along a corridor near the coffeeshop. Nurhan and Kamal initially walked past Melvin to ascertain his identity before turning and walking towards him. Kamal started punching Melvin incessantly which caused Melvin to fall off the chair. While he was on the ground, Kamal continued to punch and kick Melvin. Nurhan kicked Melvin several times as well. During the attack, Kamal and Nurhan primarily targeted Melvin’s head area. Kamal and Nurhan had the common intention to cause hurt to Melvin.

> 14.    After attacking Melvin, Kamal and Nurhan fled from the scene and returned to the private ambulance. Zainudin then drove them to Chai Chee where the trio went their separate ways. Khoo and Hussain also left the scene immediately after the attack on Melvin.

> 15.    Thereafter, at about 5.00 pm, the Accused went to pick Hussain, Khoo and Eric up from Upper Serangoon. The Accused drove them to Toa Payoh. As the Accused was driving, Khoo told the Accused that Hussain had “taught Melvin a lesson”. When they reached Toa Payoh, the Accused paid Hussain $5,000 for carrying out the assault on Melvin. Hussain then paid Zainuddin $400 and Kamal $1,000 for their roles in the assault and kept the remaining $3,600.

> 16.    Melvin was conveyed to Seng Kang General Hospital (“**SKGH**”) on the same day. As a result of the assault, Melvin sustained the following injuries:

>> a.    Non-displaced fracture of nasal bone;

>> b.    Blunt injury with contusion to face;

>> c.    Blunt injury with contusion to scalp; and

>> d.    Blunt injury with contusion to left clavicle.

> 17.    Melvin was discharged on 25 February 2020 and given three days of hospitalisation leave. The medical report from SKGH dated 23 March 2020 is attached as **Annex A.**

> 18.    Nurhan and Kamal’s usage of motor-cycle helmets and their subsequent escape through the private ambulance driven by Zainudin made detection of the offence and identification of the persons involved difficult. Eventually, arrests were made only after Zainudin implicated Nurhan and Kamal when he was identified as the driver of the private ambulance at the material time.

> 19.    By virtue of the foregoing, the Accused did abet by engaging in a conspiracy with Khoo and Hussain to a certain thing, namely, to voluntarily cause hurt to Melvin, and in pursuance of that conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing, an act took place, on 24 February 2020, at around 4.29 pm at the incident location, _to wit_, Kamal and Nurhan punched and kicked Melvin, causing Melvin to suffer from bodily hurt, and the Accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under section 323 read with section 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> **Facts relating to the 1st and 3rd charges (MAC-903082-2020 and DAC-907757-2020)**

> **D**.     **Parties**

> 20.    The co-Accused persons are as follows:

>> a.    Khoo Tsu Peng, a 67-year-old Singaporean (“**Khoo**”); and

>> b.    Loy Jit Chan, a 39-year-old Singaporean male (“**Loy**”).

> **E**.     **First Information Report**

> 21.    On 29 March 2020, at around 1.00 pm, police officers conducted an operation at the void deck of Blk 169 Lor 1 Toa Payoh, Singapore 310169 (“**the incident location**”). Other than the Accused, 12 other persons were arrested for offences under the Remote Gambling Act 2014 (No. 34 of 2014 (“**RGA**”).

> **F**.     **The offence**

> 22.    Investigations revealed that the Accused knew that Khoo was involved in illegal gambling. As the Accused was interested, Khoo gave the Accused a link to the website ‘www.ez123.skk.268.com’, which is a remote gambling service for Hong Kong horse race meetings not provided by an exempt operator or a person otherwise exempt under section 40 from section 10 or 11 of the RGA. Between 19 March 2020 and 29 March 2020 (both dates inclusive), the Accused did gamble using remote communication and using a remote gambling service by logging into his account with his user identification ‘ddd88’ and password ‘XXX’ to place horse racing bets. In total, the Accused’s bet value was $35,118.75.

> 23.    Investigations further revealed that the Accused also used remote communication to gamble by sending illegal 4D bets via SMS on his mobile phone to Loy, which is a remote gambling service for the Singapore Pools 4D draws held between 1 October 2019 and 27 March 2020 (both dates inclusive). Loy was not an exempt operator, or a person otherwise exempt under section 40 from section 10 or 11 of the RGA. In total, the Accused’s bet value was $39,142.60.

> 24.    By virtue of the foregoing, the Accused has committed two offences under section 8(1) of the RGA.

## Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

7       The Prosecution submitted for a global sentence of **at least eight to nine months’ imprisonment and $10,000/- fine**.

### 5th charge – Abetment by conspiracy with Khoo and Hussain to voluntarily cause hurt to Melvin (s 323 r/w s 109 PC)

8       The Prosecution submitted for a sentence of at least eight to nine months’ imprisonment for this charge. The prosecution applied the sentencing framework laid down in the case of _Public Prosecutor v Low Song Chye and anor appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 526</span> (“**_Low Song Chye_**”), and followed the two-step process for sentencing offenders under s 323 PC.

### Applying the Low Song Chye framework

9       Applying the first step, given the injuries suffered by the victim, namely, (a) non-displaced fracture of nasal bone; (b) blunt injury with contusion to face; (c) blunt injury with contusion to scalp; and (d) blunt injury with contusion to left clavicle, and the victim was given three days of hospitalisation leave, the Prosecution identified the sentencing band to fall within Band 2 of Moderate Harm, i.e. between four weeks’ to six months’ imprisonment.

10     As the victim suffered a _nasal bone fracture_ with multiple contusions on his _face/head_, which is a vulnerable part of his body, and considering that the injuries were non-permanent in nature, the Prosecution submitted that the starting point sentence should fall within the middle of Band 2 and a sentence of two to three months’ imprisonment would be appropriate.

11     Applying the second step of the process to make adjustments to the indicative starting point sentence based on the offender’s culpability and other relevant factors, the Prosecution submitted that the Accused’s culpability is high as there are a number of aggravating factors that would warrant an uplift of six months’ imprisonment.

12     The Prosecution highlighted that the Accused was an integral part of the conspiracy to attack the victim, the purpose of the attack was to teach the victim a lesson and to recover back his gambling winnings. The Accused also financed the whole operation as he promised to give Khoo 40% of his gambling winnings and paid Hussain $5,000/- for the whole operation after the attack was conducted. The motive of the attack was fuelled entirely by revenge over the Accused’s dispute with the victim.

13     The Prosecution further submitted that the attack was premeditated and sophisticated. The Accused, Khoo and Hussain kept surveillance on the victim on several occasions prior to the attack to study his movements. On the day of the attack, the Accused ferried Khoo and Eric to the incident location and picked them up thereafter. Khoo and Hussain were present at the incident location and only activated Kamal and Nurhan when they assessed the victim to be at his most vulnerable – when he was sitting by himself along a corridor near the coffee shop. Instructions were given to the attackers how to identify the victim, so that the Accused and Khoo would not be implicated at the scene.

14     The attackers took careful steps to avoid being identified as they wore helmets to conceal their identities during the attack, and there was also an escape plan prepared with Zainuddin who was on stand-by to ferry them away immediately after the attack. The police only arrested the assailants after Zainudin implicated Nurhan and Kamal when he was identified as the driver of the getaway vehicle.

15     The Prosecution submitted that there were further aggravating factors as this was a (i) gang-related offence which was (ii) committed in a public space by (iii) two co-Accused persons. The offence was committed at about 4.29pm, at a coffeeshop, where patrons would likely be present.

16     In view of the above, and citing the case of _PP v. Alvin Ngor Xuan Hong_ (MA 9059 of 2020), the Prosecution submitted that an uplift of at least six months imprisonment would be appropriate where the aggravating factors such as (i) deliberation/premeditation, (ii) provocation, (iii) group violence, and (iv) offence occurring in a public place. Accordingly, the Prosecution submitted for a sentence of **at least eight to nine months’ imprisonment for this 5th charge.**

### 1st and 3rd charge – taking part in remote gambling (s 8(1) RGA)

17     The Prosecution submitted for the maximum fine of $5,000/- for each of the proceeded charge under s 8(1) RGA.

### Applying the Lau Jian Bang framework

18     The Prosecution cited the High Court case of _Lau Jian Bang v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 3 SLR 1161</span> (“**_Lau Jian Bang_**”), which held that the appropriate sentencing framework for s 8 RGA offences for first time offenders would be a fine of $1,000/- as the starting point. The fine would then be adjusted to take into account the quantum of the Accused persons’ bets, as well as other aggravating or mitigating factors.

19     In _Lau Jian Bang_, the amount involved in the Appellant’s two proceeded charges under s 8(1) RGA was $39,000/-, and the total amount involved in all the s 8(1) RGA charges was about $50,000/-. The High Court allowed the appeal and substituted the imprisonment term of two weeks’ imprisonment per charge to the maximum fine of $5,000/- per charge. Considering that the bet amount involved for the Accused’s 1st and 3rd charges is $74,261.35, and the total bet amount including the TIC charges is $114,701.75, the Prosecution submitted that the maximum fine of $5,000/- should be imposed for each proceeded charge.

## Mitigation Plea

20     In the mitigation plea, the learned Defence Counsel urged the court to impose **a fine for the s 323 read with s 109 PC charge and a total fine of $10,000/- for the s 8(1) RGA charges**.

### Circumstances leading to the offence under the 1st and 3rd charge

21     The learned Defence Counsel highlighted that the Accused was introduced to gambling online through a friend. The Accused would bet between $3,000/- to $5,000/- each day. The Accused did not make a profit and in fact suffered losses of around $10,000/- in gambling.

22     Citing the case of **_Lau Jian Bang_**, the Defence highlighted that even where the bet quantum exceeds the maximum fine prescribed, it did not automatically follow that a custodial sentence should be instead.

23     In this respect, the Defence agreed with the Prosecution that the maximum fine of $5,000/- for each charge should be imposed on the Accused, i.e. a total fine of $10,000/- for the two proceeded s 8(1) RGA charges.

### Circumstances leading to the offence under the 5th charge

24     The Defence highlighted that the Accused had previously bought lotteries from the victim on a number of occasions. In 2018, The Accused struck the first prize which was about $987,000/-. This was the first time the Accused won the lottery and he was very excited to receive the prize money. However, the victim told the Accused that he was unable to pay him. The Accused was understandably angry and frustrated. Thereafter, despite multiple phone calls and messages, the victim became uncontactable.

25     In December 2019, the Accused was introduced to one “_Rabul_” (Mohamed Hussain Shah Bin Abdullah) from another acquittance called Khoo Tsu Peng (“Soo Koo”). Sometime early January 2020, Soo Koo told the Accused that Rabul could assist him in obtaining monies back from the victim.

26     In late February 2020, the Accused and Soo Koo went to the aforesaid coffeeshop and saw the victim. Soo Koo informed the Accused that as they already knew the movement of the victim, they would instruct Hussain to strike Melvin.

27     On the 24th of February 2020, the Accused was informed by Soo Koo that _Rabul_ had assaulted the victim.

### Factors for consideration

28     The learned Defence Counsel submitted the following factors for consideration:

> (a)     The Accused is sincerely remorseful for his actions. Since April 2020, the Accused has ceased all forms of gambling and spends most of his time with his family.

> (b)     The Accused comes from a loving and close-knit family and is the sole breadwinner as his wife is a full-time housewife. Most of his children are still studying and dependent on him. His son is a medical student at the National University of Singapore and his younger daughters are completing their undergraduate studies in Music and Arts.

> (c)     The Accused is not an ill-tempered or violent man by nature. He is a first-time offender, and this would be also be his last offence.

> (d)     The Accused has pleaded guilty to these charges at an early point in time, instead of wasting the Court’s precious time and resources. He has fully accepted responsibility for his actions, evincing his genuine remorse.

> (e)     The Accused desired to make amends and wanted to make compensation to the victim for his injuries. However, the victim declined to be compensated.

> (f)     The Accused’s culpability and involvement in the incident is limited.

### Applying the Low Song Chye framework

29     The learned Defence Counsel applied the **_Low Song Chye_** sentencing framework and two-step enquiry, and submitted that the injuries of the victim as stated in the medical report did not worsen as there were no further medical reports, and that the victim would have recovered from the injuries. In view of this, the hurt caused would fall under the lower end of Band 2 and warrant a starting imprisonment of four weeks.

30     As for the Accused’s culpability, the Defence submitted that it was Khoo who co-ordinated and planned the entire assault. Khoo had egged the Accused to teach the victim a lesson and recruited Hussain who subsequently recruited Nurhan, Zainudin and Kamal to carry out the attack. Khoo also showed the Accused Zainudin’s ambulance which would ferry Hussain’s “hitmen” and arranged the pick-up location. Khoo planned how the attack would be executed, including the parts of the victim’s body to be targeted during the attack.

31     On the day of the incident, Khoo informed Zainuddin, Nurhan and Kamal of the victim’s location and together with Hussain, kept surveillance on the victim before and during the assault. Khoo also directed the Accused to drive him and Eric to the incident location and the Accused left immediately after that. It was only later that Khoo called the Accused to pick him, Hussain and Eric up from Upper Serangoon to Toa Payoh.

32     The learned Counsel submitted that the Accused was not aware on how or when the assault would occur. He was not present at the scene when the assault took place. He did not plan for the assault and had no control over the two assailants. Further, the Accused did not even recognise or know the two assailants.

33     The Defence submitted that the Accused’s culpability was limited to the conversations with Khoo to obtain back his lottery monies and that the entire assault was orchestrated by Khoo, with little or no input from the Accused. The learned Counsel submitted that the Accused’s role was minimal and that it was Khoo who was the mastermind behind the assault.

34     Further, the original arrangement between the Accused and Khoo was that the Accused intended to give Khoo 40% if Khoo managed to successfully collect the amount owed by the victim. There was no prior agreement to pay Hussain for the role which he played in the incident.

35     In view of the above mitigating factors, the learned Counsel urged the Court to impose a fine on the Accused.

36     Further, in support of the submission, the Defence submitted several medical reports from Dr Alfred Cheng, Consultant Interventional Cardiologist; Dr Tan Yung Khan, Senior Consultant Urology; and in particular, Dr Leong Jern Lin, Senior Consultant Ear Nose Throat Surgeon of Ascent Ear Nose Throat Specialist Group Pte Ltd which medical report dated 4 August 2021 stated that the Accused is deemed not suitable for incarceration.

### Medical report by Dr Leong Jern-Lin

37     In the medical report issued by Dr Leong, Dr Leong diagnosed the Accused to be suffering from Severe Obstructive Sleep (OSA) with severe episodes during REM sleep and lowest oxygen saturation reaching nadir of 81%. Dr Leong has advised the Accused to use the Continuous Positive Airway Pressure machine (CPAP) every night for the long term. This device will require to be connected to an electrical power outlet in order to function. This will help reduce his risk of getting heart attacks and strokes. In view of the Accused’s Ischaemic Heart Disease, Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease and Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) and the need for a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Machine (CPAP), which is to be used every night for the long term, and which device requires to be connected to an electrical power outlet to function, the Accused is deemed not suitable for incarceration.

38     In an addendum report dated 27 August 2021, Dr Leong reiterated that the Accused suffers from OSA, a serious medical condition which is closely linked to several life-threatening conditions. Without CPAP treatment, it may cause or worsen chronic illnesses like heart attack, strokes, irregular heartbeats, high blood and also lead to sudden cardiac death. The learned Counsel highlighted Dr Leong’s report that (a) the Accused would require the use of his CPAP machine whenever he sleeps (regardless of day or night) for the long term; (b) the device would need to be placed in a lower position than the patient’s bed for optimal function; and (c) plugged into a power outlet. Dr Leong reiterated that the Accused is deemed not suitable for incarceration due to his medical needs.

## The Prosecution’s Reply

39     In reply to the Mitigation Plea, the Prosecution submitted that the Defence has sought to downplay the Accused’s culpability and that he was not a mere bystander who had no control over the situation of conspiracy. The Accused could have called off the operation at any time but he wanted to get back his gambling winnings from the victim and even promised Khoo 40% of his gambling winnings if Khoo succeeded in recovering the money from the victim.

40     Further, the Accused should not be allowed to hide behind the violence of the hitmen who received custodial sentences, except for Nurhan who was sentenced to Reformative Training as he was a youthful offender. The Prosecution submitted that a fine would be severely disproportionate to the Accused’s culpability.

41     As for the Accused’s medical conditions, the Prosecution submitted that Dr Leong who is in private practice would not be in a position to comment on whether or not Prisons would be able to reasonably manage the Accused’s medical condition. In this regard, the Prosecution has obtained confirmation from the Chief Medical Officer of Prisons that Prisons have the experience of managing inmates who require CPAP long term and such patients would be placed in their medical centres where there will be sufficient power points to ensure the functioning of their CPAP machine at night.

42     Citing the authority of _Chew Soo Chun v PP and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 6</span> (“**_Chew Soo Chun_**”), the Prosecution submitted that the present case does not fall within an exceptional case for the exercise of judicial mercy, which is an exceptional recourse available for truly exceptional cases. As to whether the Accused’s ill-health is relevant as a mitigating factor, the Prosecution submitted that there is no medical evidence to show that an imprisonment term would be crushing and disproportionate to his culpability or physical condition.

43     Further, the Prosecution submitted that Prisons has the capability of addressing the medical conditions to an acceptable standard. Hence, the Accused’s ill-health and medical conditions should be taken as a neutral factor rather than a mitigating factor. Accordingly, the Prosecution submitted that the Accused’s ill-health and medical conditions should not be given any mitigating weight given his culpability and involvement in the conspiracy from the start and he financed the whole operation.

## Punishment Prescribed

44     The prescribed punishment for an offence of voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 of the Penal Code provides:

> “Whoever, except in the case provided for by section 323 A or 334, voluntarily causes hurt, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to **_3 years, or with fine which may extend to $5,000, or with both_**.”

45     It should be noted that since the High Court decision of **_Low Song Chye_** which prescribed the three broad sentencing bands providing indicative sentencing ranges based on the hurt caused by the offence, the prescribed imprisonment term for the offence under s 323 PC has since been raised from two years to three years.

## Sentencing Considerations

### Applicable sentencing framework

46     In the landmark case of **_Low Song Chye_**, the High Court laid down the following two-step process for sentencing offenders under s 323 PC at \[77\]-\[79\].

> (a)     First, the court should identify the sentencing band and where the particular case falls within the applicable indicative sentencing range by considering the actual harm caused by the offence. This would allow the court to derive the appropriate indicative starting point. The following bands for a first-time offender who pleads guilty are as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="11.06%"> <col width="55.7%"> <col width="33.24%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Band</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Hurt Caused</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Indicative Sentencing Range</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Low harm</b>: no visible injury or minor hurt such as bruises, scratches, minor lacerations or abrasions</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fines or short custodial term of up to four weeks</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Moderate harm</b>: hurt resulting in short hospitalisation or a substantial period of medical leave, simple fractures, or temporary or mild loss of a sensory function</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Between four weeks’ to six months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Serious harm</b>: serious injuries which are permanent in nature and/or which necessitate significant surgical procedures</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Between six to 24 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

> (b)     Second, the court should make the necessary adjustments to the indicative starting point sentence based on its assessment of the offender’s culpability as well as all other relevant factors. This may take the eventual sentence out of the applicable indicative sentencing range.

### Applying the Low Song Chye framework

47     Applying the Low Song Chye sentencing approach, I agreed with the Prosecution and the Defence that the harm caused to the victim is moderate and that the present case falls within Band 2 of the sentencing framework, which indicative sentencing range is between four weeks’ to six months’ imprisonment.

48     I note that the victim was attacked at the vulnerable part of his body, namely his face and head area, and he sustained multiple bruises over his bilateral forehead, bilateral maxillary area and nose bridge. More significantly, the victim suffered a non-displaced fracture to the nasal bone and other injuries to the face, scalp and left clavicle. He was given three days of hospitalisation leave.

49     I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that a starting point sentence of two to three months’ imprisonment would be appropriate and I assessed the starting point to be as such. The nasal bone fracture sustained by the victim in the present would fall within the definition of grievous hurt in s 320(g) of the Penal Code. In fact, Zainuddin, Kamal and Nurhan, who had pleaded guilty earlier than the Accused, were all dealt with under s 325 of the Penal Code.

50     For their roles under the proceeded charge, Zainuddin was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment, Kamal received 13 months’ imprisonment, and Nurhan who was 20 years old at the time of the offence, was sentenced to undergo Reformative Training for a minimum of 12 months detention in RTC.

51     While the non-displaced fracture of the nasal bone suffered by the victim was not a permanent injury, it was a more serious injury as compared to a non-permanent hearing loss sustained by the victim in _Low Song Chye_. The High Court also noted the case of _PP v Tey Kok Peng_ (District Arrest Case No. 912220 of 2014), which involved two co-accused persons who punched and kicked the victim on his back and head while the victim was on the ground. The victim in that case suffered a left orbital fracture as a result of the accused’s punch, amongst other injuries. The accused in _Tey Kok Peng_ pleaded guilty, had no similar antecedents, and was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment.

52     The High Court in _Low Song Chye_ considered the precedents and the range of hurt encapsulated within Band 2, and found that _Tey Kok Peng_ was a case that would have fallen within the middle of Band 2. Considering that the indicative staring point in that case would be between two to three months’ imprisonment, I was not able to agree with the learned Counsel’s submission that a starting imprisonment term of four weeks for the present case was warranted.

53     I next turn to the second step of the framework set out in _Low Song Chye_. At this stage, the indicative sentence should be adjusted having regard to the offender’s culpability, as well as all relevant aggravating and mitigating factors.

54     In this respect, I agreed with the Prosecution that a significant uplift is required given the many aggravating factors present in this case.

55     First, the Accused financed the entire attack by promising to give Khoo 40% of his gambling winnings owed to him by the victim. The amount involved is substantial as the accused was owed about $987,000/- for the first prize winning. Furthermore, after the assault on the victim, the Accused also paid Hussain $5000/- for the whole operation. Hussain then paid Zainuddin $400/- and Kamal $1,000/- for their roles in the assault. Hussain kept the remaining $3,600/-.

56     Secondly, as rightly pointed out the learned DPP, the Accused was clearly motivated by revenge over his monetary dispute with the victim. In order to teach the victim “a lesson” and to recover back his gambling winnings, he was prepared and promised to give 40% of the amount to Khoo, and he later paid $5,000/- to Hussain after the attack was conducted. While Khoo had introduced Hussain to the Accused or had recruited Hussain, a senior member of the ‘Omega’ Secret Society, who in turn recruited Kamal and Nurhan, both were fighters of the Secret Society, the Accused was prepared to go along with Khoo’s plans.

57     While the Accused was not at the scene to personally witness the final assault by the two hitmen, the Accused conducted surveillance with Khoo and visited the incident location several times to study the victim’s movements. On one occasion, they were accompanied by a friend, one Chan Weng Hoong Eric. Khoo also visited the incident location with Hussain to point out the victim to him. In my view, the Accused would have to identify the victim and single him out to Khoo and Hussain in order for the assailants to carry out the attack on the victim. He was clearly engaged in the conspiracy to cause hurt to the victim right from the start. Hence, I could not place any weight to the learned Counsel’s submission that the Accused was not aware on how or when the assault would occur, who the assailants were, or that he was not present at the scene when the assault took place.

58     In fact, on the day of the attack, the Accused had ferried Khoo and Eric to the incident location to “ambush” the victim, and he also picked up Hussain, Khoo and Eric thereafter. The fact that the Accused had left the incident location immediately after driving Khoo and Eric to the incident location and returned home would not reduce his culpability for the offence given that he had been briefed by Khoo of the imminent attack on the victim, including showing the Accused the ambulance that would be used to ferry the “hitmen” to carry out the attack.

59     In this respect, I agreed with the learned DPP that the attack was fairly sophisticated and clearly pre-meditated. After the Accused left, Khoo and Hussain were at the incident location to keep surveillance on the victim. Having ascertained the victim’s exact location and his attire, Khoo activated the two assailants, Kamal and Nurhan when the victim was sitting alone along a corridor near the coffeeshop. The two assailants wore helmets to conceal their identities and there was an escape plan and a getaway vehicle and driver, Zainuddin on standby to drive them away immediately from the scene after the attack.

60     Another aggravating factor which I could not ignore is that there was an element of secret-society involvement as Hussain was a senior member of the ‘Omega’ Secret Society of the ‘Independent’ Group and the two hitmen were younger members and fighters of the secret society. The two fighters and hitmen brazenly ambushed and attacked the victim in broad daylight in the afternoon when he was alone and in a public space at a coffeeshop, and one could expect members of the public in the vicinity and would be alarmed by the use of violence on the vctim.

61     In this regard, I was not able to agree with the learned Counsel that the Accused’s culpability was limited. The facts of this case clearly showed that the Accused brought his feud with the victim to Khoo, who then enrolled Hussain, who in turn recruited the assailants, Kamal, Nurhan and hired the getaway driver, Zainudin. The Accused knew and agreed to this, and went along with Khoo’s plan to assault the victim in order to teach him a lesson and to recover the money owed by the victim to the Accused. He also financed the operation and promised to give Khoo 40% of the amount and paid $5,000/- to Hussain. As rightly highlighted by the learned DPP, the Accused should not be allowed to now hide behind the hitmen, and downplay his role to minimise his culpability and receive a sentence that is disproportionately lower than that received by the others and would not adequately reflect his culpability.

62     I have also considered the mitigating factors highlighted by his learned Counsel, namely that the Accused has pleaded guilty, that he is a first offender, and that he is remorseful for his actions and offered to pay compensation to the victim.

63     However, I was of the view that these factors were not significant mitigating factors given that the offence was uncovered once the police was able to identify Zainudin as the driver of the private ambulance who facilitated the escape of the assailants, and implicated them. Once the hitmen were arrested, the conspiracy involving the Accused, Khoo and Hussain to cause hurt to the victim would be exposed.

### The Accused’s ill-health and medical conditions

64     I shall next deal with the Defence’s submission that the Accused is deemed not suitable for incarceration and that the court should impose a fine on the Accused.

65     The learned DPP informed the court that they have received confirmation from the Chief Medical Officer of Singapore Prisons Service that Prisons has the necessary experience to manage inmates who require CPAP long term. As Dr Leong is a doctor in private practice, he would not be in a position to comment on whether or not Prisons are able to reasonably manage the accused’s medical condition. I see no reason to doubt that Prisons are not able to manage the Accused’s medical conditions.

66     In my view, the real question is whether the Accused’s ill-health is relevant to the sentencing consideration. In this regard, the High Court in _Chew Soo Chun v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 6</span> at \[38\]-\[39\] (“**_Chew Soo Chun_**”) has stated that ill-health is relevant to sentencing in two ways.

67     First, it is a ground for the exercise of judicial mercy. Judicial mercy is an exceptional recourse available for truly exceptional cases and which will likely result in an exceptional sentence. Where mercy is exercised, the court is compelled by humanitarian considerations arising from the exceptional circumstances to order the minimum imprisonment or a non-custodial sentence where appropriate.

68     Second, it exists as a mitigating factor. The court takes into account the fact that ill-health may render an imprisonment term that will not otherwise be crushing to one offender but may be to another, and attenuates the sentence so that it will not be disproportionate to his culpability and physical condition.

69     In all other cases, ill-health is irrelevant to sentencing. While the offender may have a condition or several conditions, unless he can satisfy the tests for exercising judicial mercy or for mitigating a sentence because of disproportionate suffering or deceased culpability, there is no proper basis to vary the sentence.

70     Having perused the various medical reports, namely from Dr Leong the ENT specialist, the consultant cardiologist, and the senior consultant urologist, I was of the view his medical conditions of the Accused do not justify the court from deviating from what would otherwise be an appropriate sentence.

71     There were no reasons for the court to think that the Singapore Prisons Service would not have the necessary and proper medical facilities to manage the Accused’s medical conditions during the period of his incarceration and there are no exceptional circumstances which would warrant the court imposing a fine instead of a custodial sentence as submitted by his learned Counsel. As such, I could not place any weight to Dr Leong’s opinion that the Accused is deemed to be unsuitable for incarceration purely on account of his medical needs, which could be managed by Prisons.

72     As recently stated by CJ Menon in _Chau Ya Zi Sandy v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 204</span> at \[15\], judicial mercy is an exceptional judicial response that seeks to express society’s sympathetic reaction to the particular plight of the offender. However, the court must be vigilant in guarding against the danger of moderating the punishment on an unprincipled basis as it may endorse the view that ill-health or personal hardship is a licence to offend or may shield an offender from the due consequences of his actions. The court must not lose sight of the important public interest in and societal benefits to be had from denouncing crime, safeguarding and protecting society from crime and ultimately in seeking the rehabilitation of offenders through the imposition of a suitable punishment. Hence, cases where judicial mercy can be invoked will be truly exceptional.

73     In my view, the Accused’s medical conditions of Ischaemic Heart Disease, Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease and Severe Obstructive Sleep Apnoea, requiring nightly and long-term use of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Machine (CPAP), do not justify deviating from what would otherwise be an appropriate sentence.

74     Accordingly, I agreed with the Prosecution that an uplift of six months’ imprisonment would be appropriate.

75     In the final analysis, applying the _Low Song Chye_ sentencing framework and the two-step sentencing process, I was of the view that a sentence of **eight (8) months’ imprisonment** would be an appropriate sentence for the 5th charge under s 323 read with s 109 PC having regard to the harm caused to the victim and the culpability of the Accused.

### Sentence for the 1st and 3rd charge – taking part in remote gambling (s 8(1) RGA)

76     For completeness, for the remaining two charges under s 8(1) RGA, I imposed the maximum fine of $5,000/- in default 5 weeks’ imprisonment for each of the charge.

77     I was guided by the High Court decision of _Lau Jian Bang_, and having regard to the large quantum of the bets involved, a total of $74,261.35 for the two proceed charges, and a total of $114,701.75 including the TIC charges, I agreed with the Prosecution and the Defence that it would be appropriate to impose the maximum fine of $5,000/-.

## Conclusion

78     In summary, I imposed a sentence of a fine of $5,000/- in default 5 weeks' imprisonment for each of the two proceeded s 8(1) RGA charges and eight (8) months’ imprisonment for the s 323 read with s 109 PC charge. The total sentence was **eight (8) months’ imprisonment and a fine of $10,000/- in default 10 weeks imprisonment**. The Accused has paid the fine.

79     The Accused being dissatisfied with the imprisonment sentence imposed had lodged an appeal against his sentence. He is currently on bail pending appeal.
