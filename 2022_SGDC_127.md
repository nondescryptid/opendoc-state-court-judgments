Tort – Defamation – Justification

8 June 2022

### District Judge Lim Wee Ming:

## Introduction

1       The plaintiff’s claim against the defendant is for defamation, arising from the defendant’s Facebook posts, that the plaintiff’s “sense of logic and reason” has been impaired and that the plaintiff is incapable of “empathy, compassion, gratitude and the capability to love others”. The plaintiff claims damages in the sum of $80,000. The defendant has raised the defences of justification and fair comment.

2       Having considered the evidence and the parties’ submissions, I find that the defendant succeeds in his defence of justification. Accordingly, the plaintiff’s claim is dismissed. The grounds for dismissing the plaintiff’s claim are set out herein.

## Facts

3       The plaintiff is a well-known marathon runner, whose sporting achievements have been widely reported in the news media. He represented Singapore and won the gold medal for the marathon at the 2015 and 2017 South East Asian Games (“SEA Games”).[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) In 2019, he set the half marathon national record and broke the Singapore marathon record.[^2]

4       The plaintiff is very active on social media[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) and his evidence was that he has a healthy number of supporters on social media.[^4] It is through social media, that the plaintiff promotes his sponsors and causes. The controversies raised by the plaintiff through social media have been extensively reported in the news media.

5       The defendant was the Vice-President (Training and Selection) of Singapore Athletics (“SA”) from 15 October 2018 to 30 June 2019 and Executive Director of SA from 1 July 2019 to 4 November 2020.[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5) SA is a National Sports Association in Singapore for athletics.[^6]

6       The defendant is also a Sports Development Officer of the Singapore National Olympic Council (“SNOC”).[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7) SNOC is the organisation in charge of selecting athletes to represent Singapore at major sporting events, including the SEA Games.[^8]

7       According to the defendant, he had assisted the plaintiff in obtaining financial support for his training, including:

> (a)     Approving the plaintiff’s request for financial support from SA to race at the Nittaidai University Time Trials in November 2018.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9)

> (b)     Approving the plaintiff’s request for financial support in May 2019, to race at the Tokai University Time Trials.[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10)

> (c)     Assisting the plaintiff to obtain Tier 1 financial support to prepare for the 2019 SEA Games.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11)

> (d)     Initiating a scheme at Flash Athletics Club to pay the plaintiff a sum of $2,000, to assist in paying for his coach.[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12)

8       The plaintiff does not dispute the aforesaid support and assistance, but takes the position that “the Defendant was doing nothing more than what he had volunteered to and was duty-bound to do.”[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13)

### The plaintiff’s conduct

9       In the 2017 SEA Games, the plaintiff was embroiled in the following controversies:

> (a)     Under SNOC’s Team Membership Agreement (“SNOC TMA”), the plaintiff was to adhere to a “Blackout Period” commencing 14 days before the 2017 SEA Games and 7 days after the event, wherein the plaintiff was not to promote any personal sponsors other than those that had been approved by SNOC during this period.[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14) The plaintiff’s personal sponsor was ASICs, whereas SA’s sponsor was 2XU. The plaintiff was unhappy that he could not promote his personal sponsor, ASICs, but did so obliquely, by referring to a Japanese shoe company whose name “rhymes with basics.”[^15] The plaintiff encouraged others to name his sponsors by posting that “We can’t name the brands but you can.”[^16] This was followed by posts from his supporters on the plaintiff’s social media page, promoting his sponsors.[^17]

> (b)     The plaintiff complained on his social media page about “being less than happy about athletes earning a lot less money than the officials and sponsors who agreed upon implementing this rule, many of whom sit on comfortable salaries while policing the social media activity of the very athletes that make them money in the first place. Without the athletes … sports officials wouldn’t even have a job!”[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18) The plaintiff posted a photograph of himself wearing only his gold medal and his underwear, with the hashtag “NoSponsorZone”.[^19]

> (c)     At the marathon event, the plaintiff wore a singlet provided by SA’s sponsor, 2XU, with ventilation holes cut into the singlet, contrary to the instructions of the sponsor. The plaintiff had sought permission to cut ventilation holes into his singlet, on the basis that this would improve his performance in the heat and humidity of Kuala Lumpur.[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20) SA put forward the plaintiff’s request to the sponsor, 2XU, but the request was turned down two days before the event. Despite this, the plaintiff insisted on running with the cut singlet.

> (d)     After winning the gold medal at the marathon, SNOC awarded the plaintiff $10,000 under its Multi-Million Dollar Award Programme (“MAP”). The plaintiff publicly disparaged SNOC’s requirement that the plaintiff donate 20% of the award to SA, and stated that “underperforming SA administrators … should be getting a 20 percent pay cut”.[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21) The plaintiff’s position was that his coach was more deserving of the 20% than SA, and that other athletes and sports officials had also criticised SA.

10     In 2018, the plaintiff disputed an incident of fair play that occurred at the 2015 SEA Games marathon. At that event, a fellow competitor, Ashley Liew, had slowed down to allow other competitors who had made a wrong turn to catch up. Ashley Liew was subsequently nominated by SNOC and awarded the International Fair Play Committee’s Pierre de Coubertin World Fair Play Trophy (“the Fair Play Trophy”). Three years after the event, the plaintiff claimed in a post in October 2018, that “this fictional version of events … is simply not true.”[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22) Thereafter, the plaintiff repeatedly disparaged Ashley Liew and SNOC in relation to this incident and the fair play award.

11     On 1 April 2019, SNOC’s solicitors sent a letter of demand to the plaintiff, informing the plaintiff that there were multiple witnesses who saw Ashley Liew slowing down who had provided statutory declarations of their account. The plaintiff was requested to retract his statements.[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23) The plaintiff refused to do so, stating that he would “not back down from the truth” and that legal letters “are a waste of resources better used through supporting our athletes.”[^24]

12     On 9 April 2019, the defendant and Ang Peng Siong (“Ang”), the then vice-president of training and selection of SA, met the plaintiff to counsel him. According to the defendant and Ang, at that meeting:

> (a)     It was explained to the plaintiff that he had breached the SA Code of Conduct. The plaintiff was referred to the Olympic Charter and informed that his conduct was unbefitting as a national athlete.

> (b)     The plaintiff was told of the possible consequence of his behaviour including disciplinary action and withdrawal of sponsor support.

> (c)     It was explained to the plaintiff that SA could not allow individuals to hurt the collective fraternity. The plaintiff was advised on the ways he could repair the situation and offered an action plan to positively engage the fraternity as an ambassador for athletics.[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25)

13     The plaintiff disputes the aforesaid account of the meeting. He claims that the meeting was to discuss the preparation for the 2019 SEA Games and that he was never informed that he was in breach of the SA Code of Conduct or the SNOC TMA. According to the plaintiff, no attempts were made to counsel him.[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26)

14     In May 2019, the plaintiff put up the following posts:

> (a)     On 10 May 2019, in response to a letter of demand from Ashley Liew’s lawyer, the plaintiff posted that “I just feel sorry for the guy that is going to such lengths to salvage his sportsmanship tale. The time and energy spent on this would be better served training and becoming a better athlete instead.”[\[note: 27\]](#Ftn_27)

> (b)     On 26 May 2019, under the hashtag “42ReasonsWhyIHate RunningMarathons”, the plaintiff posted about “the risk of wrong turn” and “you might have idiots who take the chance to make up a hero story about slowing down to wait for others as an excuse for that’s why they didn’t win, then send you lawyer’s letter when you call their bullshit and \[embarrass\] them publicly.”[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28)

15     In June 2019, Ashley Liew commenced a defamation suit against the plaintiff. Ashley Liew succeeded in his claim and was awarded $180,000 in damages by the trial judge in September 2021, which was upheld on appeal in March 2022. The plaintiff’s evidence was that through crowdfunding, he managed to raise $80,000 from the public, towards paying the judgment against him.[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29)

16     In July 2019, SA nominated the plaintiff to participate in the 2019 SEA Games.[\[note: 30\]](#Ftn_30) The defendant’s evidence is that he had, together with the relevant committees in SA, approved the plaintiff’s nomination.[^31]

17     However, SNOC rejected SA’s nomination. In a media release on 1 August 2019, SNOC stated:

> (a)     “Since the 2017 SEA Games, there have been numerous instances where \[the plaintiff\] has displayed conduct that falls short of the standards of attitude and behaviour that the SNOC expects of and holds its athletes to, considering that they are held up and seen as representatives of the country and as examples to our sporting youth.”

> (b)     “As such, SNOC has decided to reject SA’s nomination for his national representation at the 2019 SEA Games.”[\[note: 32\]](#Ftn_32)

18     The plaintiff responded by publishing a post on 1 August 2019, disparaging SNOC’s president and his team for having “chosen to behave in such a petty manner” and that SNOC’s actions were “akin to primary school playground politics”.[\[note: 33\]](#Ftn_33)

19     The plaintiff followed up with a post on 15 August 2019, stating that:

> (a)     SA had on 2 August 2019, alleged in the media that the plaintiff had committed a series of transgressions without giving any explanation or details.

> (b)     The plaintiff had served a legal letter on the defendant to request clarification on these allegations. SA had issued a reply that contained “zero explanations or details”.

> (c)     The plaintiff queried whether the defendant was paid by SNOC and whether this affected his decision-making as SA Executive Director.[\[note: 34\]](#Ftn_34)

### The defendant’s posts against the plaintiff

20     On 17 August 2019, the defendant published on his Facebook profile page, a photo of himself carrying two children, with the statement “I hope one of you will eventually take up the 400m Hurdles. Do be careful of the marathon, it could end up messing up your mind and heart …”.

21     In reply to another Facebook user as to how “Marathon messes up the mind and heart”, the defendant stated “it did! Big time! But observed only in one particular runner so far. It messed up his sense of logic and reason beyond repair. Feel really sorry for him. Let’s pray for him…”[\[note: 35\]](#Ftn_35) (referred to in the pleadings as the “Words”).

22     In a further reply as to how the heart was affected, the defendant stated, “it seemed to have drained him of empathy, compassion, gratitude and the capability to love others…”[\[note: 36\]](#Ftn_36) (referred to in the pleadings as the “Additional Words”).

23     According to the defendant, the aforesaid Facebook posts were removed about 15 hours after publication. In cross-examination, the defendant explained that he did this after being advised by a fellow board member that his posts were not in good taste and that he should not be making negative remarks about athletics.[\[note: 37\]](#Ftn_37)

24     In a post on 18 August 2019, the plaintiff responded that if the defendant “wants to engage in … subtle personal attacks, I’m game for an exchange in banter but my view is that he should consider not hiding behind someone else’s kids to do so.”[\[note: 38\]](#Ftn_38)

25     The plaintiff saw the defendant’s Facebook posts as retaliation against the plaintiff,[\[note: 39\]](#Ftn_39) and commenced the action herein against the defendant.

## Parties’ positions

26     It is not disputed that the Words and Additional Words refer to the plaintiff.[\[note: 40\]](#Ftn_40)

27     However, the meaning of the Words and Additional Words is disputed. The defendant further relies on the defences of justification and fair comment.

28     In the middle of the trial, after the defendant had given his evidence, the plaintiff through his counsel, made an offer in open court, to discontinue the suit with no order as to costs.[\[note: 41\]](#Ftn_41) Counsel for the plaintiff explained that the open offer was made because the plaintiff was satisfied with the concessions and admissions made by the defendant on the witness stand, felt vindicated and did not wish to put prominent figures in Singapore sports through cross-examination.[^42] He further explained that the offer should not be taken as an admission that his case is weak.[^43] The defendant did not accept the offer and the trial was completed before me.

29     In the plaintiff’s closing submissions, the plaintiff claims damages in the sum of $80,000, comprising $70,000 in general damages and $10,000 in aggravated damages.[\[note: 44\]](#Ftn_44) This was well below the plaintiff’s original claim of at least $500,000, before his suit was transferred from the High Court to the District Court, pursuant to an application by the defendant.[^45]

## Issues

30     The key issues are:

> (a)     The meaning of the Words and Additional Words.

> (b)     Whether the defendant has proven his defence of justification.

31     I find that the meaning of the Words and Additional Words are defamatory. I further find that the defendant has proven his defence of justification. The reasons for my findings are set out below. As the defendant has succeeded in his defence of justification, it is not necessary for me to make a finding on the defence of fair comment.

## Defamatory meaning

32     The plaintiff has pleaded that the Words and Additional Words have the following meanings which are false and defamatory of the plaintiff:

> (a)     The plaintiff’s “sense of logic and reason” has been impaired.

> (b)     The plaintiff is a person who lacks proper moral character and is incapable of “empathy, compassion, gratitude and the capability to love others”.[\[note: 46\]](#Ftn_46)

33     The defendant has pleaded that the Words and Additional Words meant that:

> (a)     The plaintiff had behaved unreasonably.

> (b)     The plaintiff had behaved in an illogical manner.

> (c)     The plaintiff was ungrateful.

> (d)     The plaintiff was uncaring.[\[note: 47\]](#Ftn_47)

34     The defendant has pleaded that none of these meanings are defamatory of the plaintiff.[\[note: 48\]](#Ftn_48) In his closing submissions, the defendant has submitted that the Words and Additional Words are not defamatory as the plaintiff himself had taken the position that the Words and Additional Words are banter.[^49]

### Words and Additional Words are defamatory

35     In _Golden Season Pte Ltd v Kairos Singapore Holdings Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 2 SLR 751</span> at \[36\], the High Court held that a statement is considered to be defamatory if it:

> (a)     lowers the plaintiff in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally,

> (b)     causes the plaintiff to be shunned or avoided, or

> (c)     exposes the plaintiff to hatred, contempt or ridicule.

36     I am unable to accept the defendant’s argument that the Words and Additional Words are not defamatory but were merely banter.

37     Firstly, although the defendant pleaded that the Words and Additional Words are not defamatory, the allegation that they were merely banter is not pleaded by the defendant. Furthermore, the meaning pleaded by the defendant of the Words, that the plaintiff had behaved unreasonably and in an illogical manner, and the Additional Words, that the plaintiff was ungrateful and uncaring, are defamatory of the plaintiff.

38     Accordingly, I find that the Words and Additional Words are defamatory.

### Scope of the Words and Additional Words

39     With respect to the Words, the plaintiff’s pleaded meaning that the plaintiff’s “sense of logic and reason” has been impaired is closer to the Words used than the defendant’s pleaded meaning that the plaintiff had behaved unreasonably and in an illogical manner. In the premises, I accept the plaintiff’s pleaded meaning of the Words, over the defendant’s.

40     With respect to the Additional Words, I accept the plaintiff’s pleaded meaning of the Additional Words, that the plaintiff is a person who is incapable of “empathy, compassion, gratitude and the capability to love others”, rather than the narrower meaning pleaded by the defendant that the plaintiff was ungrateful and uncaring. The meaning pleaded by the plaintiff is substantially closer to the Additional Words used, which states “it seemed to have drained him of empathy, compassion, gratitude and the capability to love others…”.

41     However, the plaintiff has also pleaded that the Additional Words mean that the plaintiff “lacks proper moral character”. I am unable to agree with the plaintiff that the defamatory meaning of the Additional Words is as broad as that, as it goes beyond the actual words used by the defendant.

42     In summary, I find that the defamatory meaning of the Words and Additional Words are as follows:

> (a)     In relation to the Words, I accept the plaintiff’s pleaded meaning that the plaintiff’s sense of logic and reason has been impaired.

> (b)     In relation to the Additional Words, the defamatory meaning is that the plaintiff is incapable of empathy, compassion, gratitude and the capability to love others.

## Justification

43     The defendant has pleaded justification and that the Words and Additional Words are true in substance and in fact. The defendant relies upon the following incidents arising from the 2017 SEA Games:

> (a)     The plaintiff’s promotion of his own sponsors during the Blackout Period and publication of disparaging remarks against SNOC.[\[note: 50\]](#Ftn_50)

> (b)     The plaintiff’s cutting of holes in the attire that was provided by SA’s competition sponsor, 2XU, contrary to the wishes of the sponsor, which led to the sponsor terminating its sponsorship of SA.[\[note: 51\]](#Ftn_51)

> (c)     The plaintiff’s post alleging that “SA has not only failed to adequately help our athletes, but they have also hindered the performance of several athletes with continued infighting, turmoil and poor administration” and was “undeserving of the $2000 (20% of $10000) that SNOC takes out of my MAP award money to give to them”.[\[note: 52\]](#Ftn_52) The plaintiff further stated in an interview that “underperforming SA administrators … should be getting a 20 percent pay cut”.[^53]

44     The defendant further relies on the following matters in support of his plea of justification, arising from Ashley Liew being awarded the Fair Play Trophy, for slowing down to allow fellow competitors who had taken a wrong turn to catch up (“the Exemplary Act”) at the 2015 SEA Games marathon:

> (a)     In October 2018, the plaintiff alleged on his social media pages that the Exemplary Act never took place and that Ashley Liew’s account of this was untrue.[\[note: 54\]](#Ftn_54) After SNOC’s solicitors informed the plaintiff that there were witnesses who had provided statutory declarations of their account of the Exemplary Act and requested that the plaintiff retract his statement, the plaintiff published further posts in April 2019, alleging that he was being “bullied or intimidated” by SNOC, that SNOC was wasting “public resources on legal means” and referred to SNOC as “clowns”.[^55]

> (b)     After he received a legal letter from Ashley Liew, demanding that the plaintiff remove his posts, apologise and pay damages, the plaintiff published a post in May 2019, mocking Ashley Liew for “going to such lengths to salvage his sportsmanship tale” and that “The time and energy spent on this would be better served training and becoming a better athlete instead.”[\[note: 56\]](#Ftn_56) In June 2019, the plaintiff published further posts stating that SNOC “should also be ashamed at themselves for failing \[to\] conduct a proper investigation of the truth” and that it had “failed to stay neutral and credible in the fact-finding process”.[^57]

45     The defendant further relies on SNOC omitting the plaintiff from the list of athletes representing Singapore at the 2019 SEA Games and the plaintiff’s subsequent posts in August 2019, attacking and mocking SNOC, alleging that:

> (a)     “SNOC President Tan Chuan-Jin and his team have chosen to behave in such a petty manner”,

> (b)     SNOC were engaging in “primary school playground politics”, and

> (c)     SNOC has “applied highly subjective, inconsistent and/or arbitrary standard in the selection process for the 2019 SEA Games and has disregarded the fundamental principles of merit-based selection”.[\[note: 58\]](#Ftn_58)

46     There are other incidents relied upon by the defendant in support of his defence of justification, such as the plaintiff wearing bright orange shoes from his personal sponsor when the athletes departed for the 2017 SEA Games,[\[note: 59\]](#Ftn_59) the plaintiff giving unauthorised interviews to the media[^60] and the plaintiff wearing the attire of his personal sponsor during the Taiwan Open 2019.[^61] I am of the view that these incidents are less significant and are not material to my decision in this case.

47     To succeed in the defence of justification, the defendant must prove the sting of the charge. In _Chan Cheng Wah Bernard and others v Koh Sin Chong Freddie and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 506</span> at \[44\], the Court of Appeal held that the defendant has only to prove the “sting” of the charge, and some leeway for exaggeration and error is given.

48     In the present case, based on my finding on the defamatory meaning of the Words and Additional Words, the charges against the plaintiff are that:

> (a)     the plaintiff’s sense of logic and reason has been impaired, and

> (b)     the plaintiff is incapable of empathy, compassion, gratitude and the capability to love others.

49     In deciding whether the defendant has proven the sting of the charges, I focused on the following key areas:

> (a)     The 2017 SEA Games.

> (b)     The Ashley Liew incident.

> (c)     The plaintiff’s posts attacking SNOC after he was omitted from the 2019 SEA Games.

### 2017 SEA Games

50     In relation to the 2017 SEA Games, I find that the plaintiff had behaved unreasonably and in an illogical manner and showed a lack of empathy, compassion and gratitude.

51     There are three incidents relating to the 2017 SEA Games which I am of the view are relevant:

> (a)     The dispute between the plaintiff and SNOC on SNOC’s Blackout Period. The plaintiff promoted his own sponsors and publicly disparaged SNOC’s officials for implementing this rule.

> (b)     The plaintiff’s cutting of ventilation holes in the attire provided by SA’s sponsor, 2XU, contrary to the instructions of 2XU.

> (c)     The plaintiff’s public protest against SNOC’s requirement that he donate 20% of the MAP prize to SA.

### 2017 SEA Games – Blackout Period dispute

52     SNOC’s Blackout Period was similar to the International Olympic Committee (“IOC”) Rule 40, which imposed a blackout period prohibiting athletes from advertising their own personal sponsors during the Olympic Games. However, in February 2015, IOC Rule 40 was revised which allowed Olympic athletes to mention non-Olympic sponsors during the Olympic Games period, provided they did not use Olympic properties or references, whereas SNOC maintained the more restrictive rule. In cross-examination, the defendant agreed that it was fair for athletes to voice concerns on this rule.[\[note: 62\]](#Ftn_62) The plaintiff submitted that in the premises, his Facebook posts between 8 to 10 August 2017, which were critical of SNOC’s blackout rule were neither illogical nor unreasonable.[^63]

53     I disagree with the plaintiff’s submission. It may have been reasonable for the plaintiff to point out the difference between the revised IOC Rule 40 and SNOC’s more restrictive rule, to highlight that SNOC should review its blackout policy. However, the plaintiff went beyond that. He promoted his own sponsors and in his post of 9 August 2017, made a personal attack that SNOC officials “who agreed upon implementing this rule, many of whom sit on comfortable salaries while policing the social media activity of the very athletes that make them money in the first place. Without the athletes … sports officials wouldn’t even have a job!”[\[note: 64\]](#Ftn_64)

54     This personal attack was unreasonable and illogical. Whatever the plaintiff’s views about SNOC’s blackout rule, the fact remains that it was the rule of the day and SNOC’s officials had to enforce the rule. It is inconceivable that the personal attack on SNOC’s officials would do anything to persuade SNOC to review its blackout rule. It did not appear that the plaintiff would stand to benefit from such a personal attack, other than drawing the attention of his supporters. In the premises, I find that the plaintiff’s personal attack on SNOC’s officials was unreasonable and illogical.

### 2017 SEA Games – cutting sponsor’s attire

55     In relation to the plaintiff wearing a 2XU singlet to the marathon event, with ventilation holes cut into the singlet, contrary to 2XU’s instructions, the plaintiff has submitted that clause 6.6.2 of SNOC TMA merely prohibits athletes from displaying “any name, logo or design … other than as expressly permitted” and that the clause prohibits such logos or designs from being cut on accessories or sports equipment. 2XU’s logo on the singlet was not cut. The plaintiff’s submission is that the cutting of ventilation holes was functional and did not breach the aforesaid clause.[\[note: 65\]](#Ftn_65)

56     The plaintiff’s submission misses the point. What is key here is that after the plaintiff had requested SA for permission to cut the ventilation holes, SA then sought the sponsor’s permission, but the sponsor did not agree to the plaintiff’s request. I am of the view that it was unreasonable of the plaintiff to insist on wearing a 2XU singlet with ventilation holes cut into the singlet, when the sponsor had expressly stated that it was not agreeable to this. It is unlikely that the plaintiff would have made that decision, if the attire was provided by his own personal sponsor, rather than SA’s sponsor.

57     It further shows that the plaintiff lacked empathy for the concerns of the sponsor, 2XU, the concerns of SA which had to manage the sponsor and the concerns of his fellow athletes who may be affected by any decision of the sponsor to review its sponsorship of athletes. Essentially in making his decision to wear the singlet with cut ventilation holes, the plaintiff was only thinking of himself and his own personal performance at the marathon event, rather than how that decision may have an impact on the organisation and his fellow athletes. The plaintiff showed a lack of empathy and compassion towards his fellow athletes who may be adversely affected by any decision by the sponsor to withdraw its sponsorship.

### 2017 SEA Games – donation of 20% of MAP award dispute

58     In relation to the plaintiff’s public protest against SNOC’s requirement that he donate 20% of the MAP prize to SA, the plaintiff has submitted that there is nothing in the SNOC TMA clauses relating to the MAP that prohibit the plaintiff from voicing his comments over the MAP award and that other athletes had publicly criticised SA’s administration.[\[note: 66\]](#Ftn_66) The plaintiff further points out that Sport Singapore’s CEO and Singapore Sports Institute Chief had called SA to “get its act together”.[^67] This argument is misconceived.

59     In raising his protest, the plaintiff went far beyond just criticising the administration of SA. The plaintiff stated that “underperforming SA administrators … should be getting a 20 percent pay cut”.[\[note: 68\]](#Ftn_68) Although it may have been open to the plaintiff to express concerns about SA which had also been expressed by other athletes, Sports Singapore and Singapore Sports Institute, it is hard to fathom how his unnecessarily combative and personal attacks on SA administrators stood to benefit either himself or his fellow athletes.

60     Again, it appears that the plaintiff was simply grandstanding to his supporters, without caring whether his words would facilitate the change which he claimed was needed at SA. The words used by the plaintiff were unreasonable and illogical and gave the impression that the plaintiff was more concerned with stoking controversy, rather than working towards real change that would benefit the sporting community.

61     Furthermore, in focusing on the sum of $2,000 that he was required to donate to SA, rather than the $8,000 he was receiving, the plaintiff showed a lack of gratitude towards SNOC. At the end of the day, the award came from SNOC and it is open to SNOC to set out the terms upon which the award is given, including the requirement that 20% be donated to SA.

### Ashley Liew incident

62     The plaintiff has submitted that the plaintiff’s actions in respect of the Ashley Liew incident, rather than being illogical and unreasonable, “were motivated by a strong sense of truth and integrity.”[\[note: 69\]](#Ftn_69)

63     I am unable to accept this proposition. I find that the plaintiff’s conduct in the Ashley Liew incident showed that he was unreasonable and illogical for the following reasons:

> (a)     The plaintiff only raised his allegation that the Exemplary Act never happened three years after the incident. Yet he expected this allegation to be accepted at face value and published posts denigrating SNOC as “clowns”[\[note: 70\]](#Ftn_70) and Ashley Liew for “going to such lengths to salvage his sportsmanship tale” and that “The time and energy spent on this would be better served training and becoming a better athlete instead.”[^71]

> (b)     SNOC had offered to allow the plaintiff to see the statutory declaration of witnesses to the Exemplary Act.[\[note: 72\]](#Ftn_72) However, the plaintiff did not take up this offer. It appears that the plaintiff had already made up his mind that he was in the right and everyone else who contradicted him was wrong, irrespective of what other witnesses had seen. The plaintiff refused to keep an open mind and shut his mind to the possibility that even if he himself had not observed the Exemplary Act, there were other witnesses who may have witnessed it.

> (c)     Despite the statutory declarations that SNOC had obtained from witnesses to the Exemplary Act, the plaintiff went on to publish posts stating that SNOC “should also be ashamed at themselves for failing \[to\] conduct a proper investigation of the truth” and that SNOC had “failed to stay neutral and credible in the fact-finding process”.[\[note: 73\]](#Ftn_73) In doing so, the plaintiff showed himself to be unreasonable and illogical, in making these allegations without even taking into consideration the statutory declarations from witnesses that SNOC had obtained.

64     In the plaintiff’s closing submissions, the plaintiff relied on his evidence in re-examination that he had raised the issue that there was no Exemplary Act in December 2015 with an SNOC official named Ho Shu Fen, and in August or September 2017 with Sports Singapore’s CEO, Lim Teck Yin, but there was no follow up.[\[note: 74\]](#Ftn_74) I find it puzzling that the plaintiff’s allegation that he had raised this issue earlier, was not previously mentioned by the plaintiff.

65     In a post of 26 October 2018, the plaintiff stated that “I will now address the question of why I have only spoken up after 3 years”. [\[note: 75\]](#Ftn_75) The plaintiff claimed that he did not do so because:

> (a)     “Nobody from the media or any of the sports officials asked me before the story was published! … Plus if it helped Ashley Liew feel better … so be it.”

> (b)     He “didn’t expect this story to snowball into 2 sportsmanship medals”.

> (c)     He “didn’t expect this story to be brought up over and over again over the past 3 years, as a tool to educate students and coaches about sportsmanship, as a means of imparting religious values, as a shining example of what all Singaporeans should aspire towards.”

> (d)     The story was “again published on International Fair Play Committee, this time even suggesting that the act of sportsmanship “probably cost Liew a medal”, that’s when I decided the tale had been exaggerated and gone too far.”

66     He concluded that “My one and only regret is not speaking up sooner”.[\[note: 76\]](#Ftn_76) No mention was made that he had raised this allegation earlier with SNOC or Sports Singapore.

67     In the premises, I find the plaintiff’s assertion in re-examination that he had raised this earlier less than credible. In any event, the plaintiff’s unreasonable and illogical conduct in relation to the Ashley Liew incident, also stems from his refusal to consider that there may have been other witnesses who may have seen the Exemplary Act, rather than just the timing of his allegation.

### Plaintiff’s posts attacking SNOC after being omitted from 2019 SEA Games

68     The plaintiff has submitted that he believed that SNOC had applied arbitrary standards in the selection process for the 2019 SEA Games, since it did not select him despite him meeting all the objective criteria.[\[note: 77\]](#Ftn_77) The plaintiff submitted that there were principled reasons for the posts that he made after he was omitted from the SEA Games, and he was not acting unreasonably or illogically.[^78]

69     In the plaintiff’s post of 1 August 2019, the plaintiff attacked and mocked SNOC, stating that:

> (a)     “SNOC President Tan Chuan-Jin and his team have chosen to behave in such a petty manner”, and

> (b)     their actions were “akin to primary school playground politics”.[\[note: 79\]](#Ftn_79)

70     It can be seen from the above post that the plaintiff has significantly downplayed his conduct after he was not selected for the 2019 SEA Games. The language he used went beyond expressing his objection to not being selected despite meeting the objective criteria. The plaintiff’s personal attacks went far beyond any disagreement on whether SNOC should take into consideration the plaintiff’s attitude and behaviour. I find that the plaintiff’s personal attacks against SNOC had descended to a level that was unreasonable and illogical.

### Decision on the issue of justification

71     In the light of the aforesaid reasons, I find that the plaintiff had persistently behaved unreasonably and illogically to the extent that it showed that his sense of logic and reason had been impaired. I wish to highlight the following matters which I have taken into consideration, in coming to this finding:

> (a)     The personal attacks publicly made against SNOC, SA and Ashley Liew, which were irrelevant to his disagreements with them. These personal attacks include:

>> (i)       Posting that SNOC officials “sit on comfortable salaries while policing the social media activity of the very athletes that make them money in the first place. Without the athletes … sports officials wouldn’t even have a job!”[\[note: 80\]](#Ftn_80)

>> (ii)       Advocating that “underperforming SA administrators … should be getting a 20 percent pay cut”.[\[note: 81\]](#Ftn_81)

>> (iii)       Denigrating SNOC as “clowns”[\[note: 82\]](#Ftn_82) and Ashley Liew “for going to such lengths to salvage his sportsmanship tale”[^83].

>> (iv)       Mocking SNOC’s president and his team as “petty” and that their behaviour was “akin to primary school playground politics.”[\[note: 84\]](#Ftn_84)

> (b)     The plaintiff’s propensity to think only from his own narrow perspective, rather than that of the organisation and his team-mates, including:

>> (i)       Insisting on wearing a cut singlet, contrary to the sponsor’s instructions, knowing that this may cause the sponsor to be unhappy and possibly terminate the sponsorship.

>> (ii)       Refusing to consider the statutory declarations obtained by SNOC from witnesses who saw Ashley Liew’s Exemplary Act, and the possibility that these witnesses may have seen the Exemplary Act, even if the plaintiff himself had not seen it.

>> (iii)       Attributing the decision to omit him from the 2019 SEA Games, to ulterior motives of pettiness and “primary school playground politics”, rather than reflecting on his own attitude and behaviour.

72     I have set out earlier, the various occasions where the plaintiff’s conduct shows a lack of empathy, compassion and gratitude. However, the meaning of the Additional Words go beyond this. I have accepted the plaintiff’s position that the meaning of the Additional Words is that the plaintiff is incapable of empathy, compassion, gratitude and the capability to love others. The fact that that the plaintiff has behaved in a manner showing a lack of empathy, compassion and gratitude, does not establish that the plaintiff is _incapable_ of empathy, compassion, gratitude and the capability to love others. The failure to show these attributes on occasions, does not mean that the plaintiff is incapable of these attributes.

73     In the plaintiff’s closing submissions, the plaintiff sought to rely on his having coached and shared his training plan with Rafael Poliquit (“Poliquit”), a rival from the Philippines, who was going through setbacks in his performance.[\[note: 85\]](#Ftn_85) Poliquit eventually clocked his personal best at the 2018 Milo Marathon and credited the plaintiff for his win.[^86] Unfortunately, Poliquit passed away in 2019 and the plaintiff wrote a tribute to his friend and rival. The plaintiff relied on the defendant’s concession in cross-examination, that such a tribute would not be written by someone who lacks empathy and capacity to love others.[^87]

74     I accept that the plaintiff’s coaching, sharing of his training plan and tribute to Poliquit, evidences his capability to show empathy and to love others. However, this does not detract from the other incidents which I have referred to earlier, which show that the plaintiff’s sense of logic and reason had been impaired and had behaved in a manner showing a lack of empathy, compassion and gratitude.

75     Under section 8 of the Defamation Act (Cap 75, 2014 Rev Ed), a defence of justification shall not fail by reason only that the truth of every charge is not proved if the words not proved to be true do not materially injure the plaintiff’s reputation having regard to the truth of the remaining charges.

76     In Gatley on Libel and Slander (12th Ed, 2013) (“Gatley”) at \[11.16\], in relation to the English equivalent of this provision, it was explained that “The logic of the provision is that the harm to reputation caused by the allegation(s) found to be true, in respect of which no damages may be recovered, is such as to render any injury to reputation that notionally might have been caused by the unproven allegation nugatory to the point of irrelevance.”

77     As an illustration of how the provision may be applied, Gatley states at \[11.16\], “if a newspaper article alleges that a person committed murder, committed adultery and on one occasion falsified his expenses, then if only the third imputation remains unproven the defendant will not be precluded by that from establishing a total defence of truth.”

78     Although the aforesaid illustration in Gatley is more clear cut than the present case, it is helpful in showing the need to weigh the gravity of the proven charges against the gravity of the unproven charge. In the present case, the court must weigh proven allegations that the plaintiff’s sense of logic and reason has been impaired and that he had behaved in a manner showing a lack of empathy, compassion and gratitude, against the unproven allegation that the plaintiff is incapable of empathy, compassion and gratitude and the capability to love others. The allegation that the plaintiff is incapable of empathy, compassion and gratitude and the capability to love others, is more serious than the proven charge that he had behaved in a manner showing a lack of empathy, compassion and gratitude. However, I also have to take into consideration the many occasions that the plaintiff had behaved unreasonably and illogically in an egregious manner, as set out earlier.

79     Weighing the proven allegations against the unproven, I find that the plaintiff’s reputation is not materially injured by the allegation that the defendant was unable to prove, taking into consideration the remaining charges that the defendant succeeded in proving. The obstinate and extreme extent to which the plaintiff acted in an unreasonable and illogical manner showing that his sense of logic and reason has been impaired, as well as the instances in which he showed a lack of empathy, compassion and gratitude, overshadow and eclipse the plaintiff’s reputation in relation to his capability to show empathy, compassion, gratitude and the capability to love others on other occasions. In the premises, I find that the defendant succeeds in his defence of justification.

80     I also took into consideration the plaintiff’s submission that SA had never made any finding of breaches on the plaintiff’s part, had made a public apology to the plaintiff in October 2020 and decided not to pursue disciplinary proceedings against the plaintiff.[\[note: 88\]](#Ftn_88) I am of the view that SA’s decision under its current president on the aforesaid matters is not relevant to the issue of justification in this case. It is for the court to make its own finding of fact as to whether the defendant has established his defence of justification. SA’s decision on the aforesaid matters has no bearing on the court’s findings, particularly in this case, where the evidence of Lien Choong Luen, the current SA president, was that the aforesaid decision was in the context of the incoming committee wishing to start a new slate and the plaintiff agreeing to discontinue his lawsuits against SA.[^89]

## Conclusion

81     As I have found in favour of the defendant on his defence of justification, the plaintiff’s claim is dismissed. Parties are to write in for directions for written submissions on costs, if they are unable to agree on costs.
