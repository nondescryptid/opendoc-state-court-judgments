Landlord and Tenant – Termination of leases – Forfeiture

22 September 2022 - Judgment reserved.

### District Judge Liu Zeming:

1       This is a seemingly straight-forward application for an order for vacant possession and double rent. It is undisputed that the Defendant-tenant defaulted in payment of rent, the lease reserved to the Claimant-landlord a right to forfeit in such event and the Claimant purports to have exercised this right. The main contention between the parties was whether the Claimant waived his right to forfeit by accepting monies from the Defendant after the purported termination of the lease.

2       However, there is a more fundamental issue: has the Claimant properly exercised his right to forfeit the lease? The Claimant appears to be under the impression that because he has a contractual right to forfeit, he could exercise it in any manner he wished. This is not correct. There are common law rules governing how the right to forfeit must be exercised. These common law rules may be archaic or inconvenient (or both), but they must be complied with.

3       Parties were given the opportunity to address this and a number of other issues at the hearing before me. Having heard them, I dismiss this Originating Application. These are my reasons.

## Background Facts

4       The following facts are not in dispute between the parties.

> (a)     The Claimant is the owner of 33 Miltonia Close, #XXX Skies Miltonia, Singapore 768064 (the “**Premises**”).[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

> (b)     By way of a tenancy agreement dated 4 January 2022 (the “**Tenancy Agreement**”), the Claimant agreed to lease the Premises to the Defendant for 12 months commencing 4 January 2022 (ending on 3 January 2023), with a monthly rent of $3,000 (the “**Monthly Rent**”).[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) Specifically:

>> (i)       Clause 1 of the Tenancy Agreement states that the Monthly Rent is payable “_in advance without deduction whatsoever_” on the 4th day of each month.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3)

>> (ii)       Clause 4(a) of the Tenancy Agreement reserved to the Claimant the right of re-entry “\[i\]_f the rent…shall not be paid for seven (7) days after its due date_” (the “**Termination Clause**”).[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4)

> (c)     The Defendant paid the Monthly Rent for January, February and March 2022, albeit late.[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5)

> (d)     The Monthly Rent for the period from 4 April 2022 to 3 May 2022 (the “**April Rent**”) was due on 4 April 2022 but the Defendant did not make payment on 4 April 2022.[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6)

> (e)     By 13 April 2022, the April Rent was still outstanding.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7)

> (f)     On 13 April 2022, the Claimant’s lawyer issued a written notice to the Defendant (the “**Purported Termination Notice**”) by which the Claimant purportedly exercised his right to terminate the Tenancy Agreement under the Termination Clause. The Purported Termination Notice states that the Defendant was to move out of the Premises by 28 April 2022 (the “**Move Out Date**”).[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8)

> (g)     On 25 April 2022, the Defendant’s cousin, one Dharma Eng (“**Dharma**”), proposed (on behalf of the Defendant) to pay to the Claimant the sum of $6,300 on condition that the termination of the Tenancy Agreement be rescinded (the “**Proposal**”). This sum of $6,300 comprises the Monthly Rent for the period 4 April 2022 to 3 June 2022 (i.e. $3,000 x 2) and the Claimant’s legal fees of $300.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9)

> (h)     The Proposal was communicated to the Claimant’s property agent, one Serene Ting (“**Serene**”) on 25 April 2022. Serene informed Dharma that she would “_talk to landlord hopefully_ \[the landlord\] _accept your proposal_”.[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10)

> (i)     On 26 April 2022, Serene sent Dharma the Claimant’s bank account details. Dharma then paid $3,300 on 27 April 2022 and another $3,000 on 28 April 2022.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11)

> (j)     On 29 April 2022, the Claimant’s lawyer issued a second letter to the Defendant (the “**29 April Letter**”) stating that the Claimant “_has not rescinded the termination of the Tenancy Agreement_” but agreed to extend the Move Out Date to 28 May 2022, with the option to further extend the Move Out Date to 28 June 2022 by payment of another $3,000 on or before 28 May 2022.[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12) The pertinent parts of the 29 April Letter are reproduced below:

>> While our client has not rescinded the termination of the Tenancy Agreement, our client grants you an extension of time to move out of the Premises to 28 May 2022. Our client will also waive the right to claim double rent but only if you move out by 28 May 2022.

>> Our client will grant you the right to extend the move out date to 28 June 2022 on condition that the sum of $3,000 is paid directly to our client on or before 28 May 2022.

> (k)     The 29 April Letter was forwarded by Serene to Dharma on the same day (i.e. on 29 April 2022) with the WhatsApp message “_Hi Dylan_ \[referring to Dharma\], _landlord had extended the lease till 28 May, a registered letter from lawyer had sent to Brendon_ \[referring to the Defendant\], _pls follow up with him_”. There was no reply from Dharma to this message.[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13)

> (l)     On 18 May 2022, Serene sent another WhatsApp message to Dharma stating: “_Morning Dylan_ \[referring to Dharma\], _remember to make payment before 28/5 to extend the stay to 28 June_”. There was no response from Dharma until two days later on 20 May 2022, when Dharma asked Serene “_have you texted brendon_ \[referring to the Defendant\] _this also?_”. Serene confirmed that she did not and Dharma replied that he will “_forward to_ \[the Defendant\] _and keep_ \[Serene\] _updated_”.[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14)

> (m)     There was no update from Dharma to Serene and on 25 May 2022 Serene sent Dharma another “_reminder to make payment before 28 May to extend the stay to 28 June_”. There was no reply from Dharma to this.[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15)

> (n)     On 27 May 2022, Serene sent yet another message to Dharma, indicating that “_if_ \[the Defendant\] _got no intention to extend the stay till 28/6 landlord will go n take over the unit on 29 May 11am_ \[sic\]”. Dharma replied to this message to say that he will get back to Serene.[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16)

> (o)     On 29 May 2022, Serene informed Dharma that she made a mistake and that the Claimant intended to do a “_handover inspection_” on 29 May 2022, and not to “_take over_” the Premises as indicated in Serene’s message of 27 May 2022. There was no response from Dharma until the morning of 31 May 2022 when Dharma said he will give Serene a call later that day.[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17)

> (p)     On 31 May 2022, the Claimant’s lawyer issued another letter to the Defendant (the “**31 May Letter**”).[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18) In the 31 May Letter, the Claimant repeated that the Termination Notice was “_not rescinded_” but the Move Out Date was extended to 28 May 2022. Since the Defendant did not pay a further sum of $3,000 to extend the Move Out Date to 28 June 2022, the Claimant purported to “_exercise his right under the Termination Clause to terminate the tenancy_”, and requests that the Defendant “_move out of the Premises immediately_”.[^19] The Defendant did not respond to the 31 May Letter.

> (q)     As at 9 September 2022 when this Originating Application was heard, the Defendant has not moved out of the Premises. Neither has he made any further payment to the Claimant.

5       Much of the factual background leading up to this application was documented and (perhaps therefore) not disputed. There is however a factual issue in dispute. This pertained to whether the Claimant agreed to the Proposal.

6       The Defendant’s position is that on 25 April 2022, Serene called Dharma and orally confirmed to Dharma that the Claimant agreed to the Proposal (i.e. to rescind the Purported Termination Notice).[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20) It was on this basis that Dharma subsequently made the payment of $6,300 on 27 and 28 April 2022. On the Claimant’s part, he denies ever having given such consent or having communicated such consent to Serene.[^21]

7       For reasons which I will explain, this factual dispute is ultimately immaterial to my decision.

## Clarifications on Orders Sought by the Claimant

8       The Claimant initially sought the following orders in this Originating Application:

> (a)     an order for possession of the Premises;

> (b)     double rent of $6,000 per month from 2 June 2022 to the date vacant possession is delivered;

> (c)     contractual interest at 10% p.a. “_on the rent unpaid_”;

> (d)     costs; and

> (e)     “_an assessment of damages on the sums due from the Defendant to the Claimant_”.

9       At the hearing before me on 9 September 2022, I sought clarification from the Claimant’s counsel (“**Mr Hanam**”) on the Claimant’s claim for contractual interest and an order for “_an assessment of damages_”. In particular, I asked Mr Hanam to clarify:

> (a)     in respect of the claim for 10% contractual interest, what is the amount of “_rent unpaid_” on which interest is to accrue, and over what period of time; and

> (b)     in respect of the claim for an order for “_an assessment of damages_”, whether it is appropriate for such an order to be given on an originating application and if so, what are the breaches in respect of which damages are to be assessed?

10     On the first question, Mr Hanam initially submitted that the 10% contractual interest is to be calculated on the amount of $3,000 for the period starting from 28 May 2022 to the date of the filing of this Originating Application (i.e. 16 June 2022). Given this submission, I sought Mr Hanam’s confirmation that it is the Claimant’s position that as at 28 May 2022, there was “_rent unpaid_” of $3,000. I consider this a necessary and logical corollary to the position taken by Mr Hanam.

11     Upon the further confirmation being sought, Mr Hanam indicated to me that the Claimant would withdraw the claim for 10% contractual interest in this Originating Application. Accordingly, I need not consider this issue.

12     On the second question, Mr Hanam initially stated that the damages to be assessed were “_rent and double rent and that is outstanding until payment or possession_”. An assessment of these damages is necessary because the Claimant does not know when payment would be made and/or when vacant possession would be delivered.

13     I do not understand this explanation since the Claimant sought a separate order for payment of double rent in the sum of $6,000 per month from 2 June 2022 to the date vacant possession is delivered. The claim for double rent is clearly quantifiable (even though the aggregate may not yet be known) and I could not see what needed to be “_assessed_”.

14     Mr Hanam then clarified that at the time of filing of the Originating Application, the “_damages_” which the Claimant had in mind were “_reinstatement costs_”. I expressed further reservations on this because insofar as the “_damages_” were in respect of reinstatement costs which _may_ be incurred by the Claimant for reinstating the Premises, it is completely speculative as the Defendant has not handed over possession of the Premises and it is not known (and not possible to know) whether the Defendant would be in breach of any obligation under the Tenancy Agreement to reinstate the Premises. The damages sought appeared relate to a cause of action which has not even accrued to the Claimant at the time this action was commenced. Mr Hanam did not address these concerns substantively, but stated repeatedly that he would “_leave it to_ \[the court\]” to decide. So be it.

## Issues for Determination

15     Given Mr Hanam’s clarifications, the following issues and sub-issues arose for determination in this Originating Application:

> (a)      **Issue 1**: In respect of the claims for vacant possession and double rent:

>> (i)       Whether the Claimant has the right to forfeit the Tenancy Agreement for non-payment of the April Rent.

>> (ii)       If so,

>>> (A)       Has the Claimant validly exercised such right?

>>> (B)       Has the Claimant by subsequent conduct waived such right?

>>> (C)       Was the Tenancy Agreement forfeited?

>> (iii)       If the Tenancy Agreement was forfeited:

>>> (A)       Whether the Defendant was holding over; and

>>> (B)       If so, since when?

> (b)      **Issue 2**: In respect of the Claimant’s claim for interlocutory judgment for damages to be assessed:

>> (i)       Whether the Claimant has an accrued cause of action for “_reinstatement costs_” for which damages can be assessed; and

>> (ii)       If so, whether it is appropriate for me to give interlocutory judgment for damages to be assessed on this Originating Application.

16     I turn to consider the issues in turn.

## Issue 1: Vacant Possession and Double Rent

17     The Claimant’s claim for vacant possession and double rent are related in that they both depended upon the Claimant having validly exercised a right of forfeiture and thereby terminating the Tenancy Agreement. I therefore consider the issues relating to both of these claims together (see \[15(a)\] above).

18     Before I do so, however, it is necessary to briefly state the law in this area as both parties appear to be misconceived (to varying degrees and on different aspects) on the law.

### The Law

19     The right to forfeit, or the right to re-enter (both used synonymously in this decision), refers to the right to terminate a lease by a landlord prior to the “natural” expiry of the lease and upon some default by the tenant: see _Hill & Redman’s Law of Landlord and Tenant_, Issue 136 August 2022, LexisNexis (“**_Hill & Redman_**”) at A\[4602\].

20     The law has historically leaned against forfeiture for non-payment of rent: see _Lye Lin Heng’s Landlord and Tenant Law in Singapore_, 2nd Edition, LexisNexis (“**_Lye Lin Heng on Landlord and Tenant_**”) at page 192. In order to forfeit a lease for non-payment of rent, the landlord must satisfy the following requirements:

> (a)      **First, there must be a right to forfeit for non-payment of rent.** Common law does not imply or infer such a right. As such, payment of rent must be made a condition of the lease or the right to forfeit for non-payment of rent must be expressly reserved: see _Alwee Alkaff v Syed Jafaralsadeg and others and another action_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 3 SLR(R) 419</span> (“**_Alwee Alkaff_**”) at \[23\] and \[24\]; _Syed Ahmad Jamal Alsagoff (administrator of the estates of Shaikah Fitom bte Ghalib bin Omar Al-Bakri and others) and others v Harun bin Syed Hussain Aljunied and others and other suits_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 3 SLR 386</span> (“**_Syed Ahmad_**”) at \[37\].

> (b)      **Second, a formal demand for rent in arrears must be made**: see _Alwee Alkaff_ at \[25\]; _Lye Lin Heng on Landlord and Tenant_ at page 193. A “formal demand” in this context refers to a demand for the exact sum due made upon the land on the exact day that it falls due and sustained until after sunset of that day (a “**Formal Demand**”): see _Hill & Redman_ at A\[4630\] – \[4640\]; _Tan Sook Yee’s Principles of Singapore Land Law_, 3rd Edition, LexisNexis (“**_Tan Sook Yee on Land Law_**”) at \[17.123\]. The requirement for a Formal Demand has been described as “_archaic and highly inconvenient_” and “_troublesome_”: see _Tan Sook Yee on Land Law_ at \[17.123\]; _Lye Lin Heng on Landlord and Tenant_ at page 193. They are indeed so. As such, most modern and well-drafted leases expressly exclude the need for a Formal Demand: see _Lye Lin Heng on Landlord and Tenant_ at page 193. This can be done by insertion of a simple proviso stating that the right of re-entry is exercisable when rent is in arrears “_whether or not formal demand has been made_” (or words to the effect): see _Lye Lin Heng on Landlord and Tenant_ at page 193; _Protax Co-operative Society Ltd v Toh Teng Seng and Another_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] SGHC 84</span> (“**_Protax_**”) at \[49\].

> (c)      **Third, the landlord must effect actual re-entry.** This is usually done by either peaceful and physical means or by the process of law. The former refers to the regaining of actual physical possession of the demised premises by the landlord: see _Hill & Redman_ at A\[4866\]. Where this is not possible (as is often the case with tenancy disputes), the landlord may effect re-entry by the process of law, and this is usually done by issuance and service of a writ for possession. The service of proceedings by the landlord, unequivocally claiming possession against the tenant, is equivalent to a physical re-entry: see _Hill & Redman_ at A\[4882\]. If forfeiture is eventually granted by the court, the lease will be deemed to have terminated from the date of service of the writ: see _Lye Lin Heng on Landlord and Tenant_ at pages 193 – 194.

21     The foregoing is subject to any waiver of the breach and/or the right of re-entry by the landlord, as well as the tenant’s right to apply for statutory or equitable relief against forfeiture.

22     When a lease is forfeited, it comes to an end. Thereupon, if the tenant (or former tenant at that point) does not move out, the tenant is said to be “_holding over_”. Subject to a periodic tenancy arising or parties’ agreement to the contrary, a tenant who holds over may be liable to pay double rent or double value for the period that he or she holds over. This is provided for in Section 28(4) of Civil Law Act 1909 (“**CLA**”), which states:

> Every tenant holding over after the determination of his tenancy shall be chargeable, at the option of his landlord, with double the amount of his rent until possession is given up by him or with double the value during the period of detention of the land or premises so detained, whether notice to that effect has been given or not.

23     To summarise the position on forfeiture for non-payment of rent:

> (a)     First, right of forfeiture for payment of rent must be expressly reserved. Alternatively, payment of rent must be a condition of the lease.

> (b)     Second, a Formal Demand must be made unless the need for such demand is contractually dispensed with.

> (c)     Third, the landlord must effect re-entry by either physical means or by process of law.

> (d)     Fourth, where re-entry is effected by process of law, the lease terminates from the service of the writ for possession.

> (e)     Fifth, the tenant may be liable for double rent or double value under Section 28(4) of the CLA if the tenant holds over “_after the determination of his tenancy_”.

24     I now consider whether the Tenancy Agreement in this case has been forfeited and if the Claimant is entitled to the reliefs sought.

### Whether the Claimant has the right to forfeit the Tenancy Agreement for non-payment of rent

25     Pursuant to the Termination Clause, the Claimant is entitled to re-enter the Premises if the Monthly Rent remains unpaid for a period of seven days after its due date.[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22) The Termination Clause states:

> If the rent hereby reserved shall not be paid for seven (7) days after its due date or if there shall be a beach of any of the conditions, covenants or stipulations on the part of the Tenant herein contained, the Landlord shall be entitled to re-enter upon the \[Premises\] and thereupon this tenancy shall immediately absolutely determine but without prejudice to any right of action of the Landlord for damage or otherwise in respect of any such breach or any antecedent breach.

26     In this case, it is undisputed that the April Rent which was due on 4 April 2022 remained unpaid for more than seven days after its due date.

27     Clearly, therefore, the right to forfeit the Tenancy Agreement for non-payment of rent has been reserved to the Claimant, and the _contractual_ conditions giving rise to the right have been satisfied. There is no argument by the Defendant to the contrary.

### Was a Formal Demand required or made?

28     The Termination Clause in this case did not dispense with the need for a Formal Demand (see Termination Clause at \[25\] above). Neither is such dispensation found elsewhere in the Tenancy Agreement. There is also no suggestion by the Claimant or Mr Hanam that such dispensation is to be implied from the Tenancy Agreement or the subject of a separate agreement between the parties.

29     As this issue (i.e. the apparent lack of a Formal Demand) was not raised by the Defendant in his written submissions, I gave Mr Hanam the opportunity to address the issue at the hearing before me.

30     Mr Hanam’s initial submission was that the applicable notice requirement is to be found in Section 18(1) of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act 1886 (“**CLPA**”), and this has been complied with. However, this is clearly erroneous since Section 18(9) of the CLPA provides that Section 18 of the CLPA “_shall not affect the law relating to re-entry or forfeiture or relief in case of non-payment of rent_”. The notice requirement under Section 18(1) of the CLPA therefore does not apply where the breach in issue is non-payment of rent. When this was brought to Mr Hanam’s attention, he rightly accepted that Section 18(1) of the CLPA has no application in this case.

31     Mr Hanam then submitted that a Formal Demand was in fact issued on 13 April 2022 by way of the Purported Termination Notice. This is again clearly erroneous. First, the Purported Termination Notice was issued on 13 April 2022. This did not comply with the requirement for a Formal Demand to be issued on the day which the rent fell due (i.e. 4 April 2022): see _Hill & Redman_ at A\[4630\] – \[4640\]; _Tan Sook Yee on Land Law_ at \[17.123\]. Second, the Purported Termination Notice was in any event not a demand for rent. Instead, it stated as follows:

> Our client \[i.e. the Claimant\] hereby exercises his right under the Termination Clause to terminate the tenancy without prejudice to exercise \[sic\] all his other rights under the Tenancy Agreement.

> Take notice that you are to move out of the Premises by 28 April 2022 and a handover shall take place on 29 April 2022 with our client’s agent.

> Take further notice that should you remain in possession of the Premises from 28 April 2022, you will be liable to pay double rent to our client and our client shall be compelled to take out legal action against you to obtain an order of possession. In such event, our client shall claim legal costs and damages to the fullest extent allowed by law.

32     The Purported Termination Notice is clearly a unilateral declaration by the Claimant of the termination of the Tenancy Agreement. It is not a demand for rent and does not meet the requirements of a Formal Demand.

33     It appeared to me from the submissions put forward at the hearing that Mr Hanam did not appreciate the common law requirements for a Formal Demand. As such and out of fairness to the Claimant, I explained to Mr Hanam the context of my question and the matters set out at \[20(b)\] above. Thereupon, Mr Hanam submitted as follows:

> (a)     First, that this court should not follow or apply the common law rules relating to a Formal Demand because these practices are archaic and developed in an era when postal service was slow and unreliable.

> (b)     Second, even if a Formal Demand is required, that requirement has been waived by the Defendant in this case since the Defendant does not dispute having received the Purported Termination Notice.

34     Both of these submissions can be dealt with briefly and quickly:

> (a)     First, while I agree that the requirement of a Formal Demand may be archaic, the requirement has been upheld by good authority which are binding on me (see _Protax_ at \[41\]; _Alwee Alkaff_ at \[25\]; _Syed Ahmad_ at \[38\]). It is not open to me to simply decide that this requirement should not be followed or applied.

> (b)     Second, I do not accept that the Defendant has waived the requirement for a Formal Notice in this case. As mentioned, the Purported Termination Notice departed in material ways from a Formal Notice. Fundamentally, it purported to _terminate_ the Tenancy Agreement instead of _demanding for rent_. Accordingly, I cannot see how the Defendant, in accepting that he _received_ the Purported Termination Notice, can be taken to have waived the requirement of a Formal Demand.

35     Accordingly, it is clear to me that the Claimant is required to but did not issue a Formal Demand in respect of the April Rent or any of the subsequent Monthly Rent prior to the commencement of this action (i.e. 16 June 2022).

36     As a result, although the right to forfeit the Tenancy Agreement has been reserved to the Claimant under the Termination Clause, this right is not exercisable by the Claimant in respect of any rental arrears which accrued prior to 16 June 2022 because no Formal Demand has been issued in respect of these rental arrears. Consequently, the Tenancy Agreement is not forfeited by service of this Originating Application on the Defendant. It follows then that the Claimant’s claim for vacant possession and double rent must be dismissed. There is no basis for me to make those orders if the Tenancy Agreement has not been terminated.

### Brief remarks on waiver

37     In view of the foregoing, it is unnecessary for me to decide whether the Claimant has waived his right of forfeiture by accepting subsequent payments from the Defendant.

38     I would, in any event, have difficulties determining this issue on the evidence before me and if it had been necessary for me to decide, I would have either sought further clarifications from the parties or invited parties to submit on whether this Originating Application should be converted to an originating claims action instead.

39     I say this because the evidence and parties’ written and oral submissions before me focuses only on the narrow issue of _whether the Proposal was accepted_. It appears to be an assumption of parties that if the Proposal was _not_ accepted, it meant that the Tenancy Agreement has been terminated and that the payment of $6,300 made to the Claimant on 27 and 28 April 2022 is to be treated in the manner set out in the 29 April Letter.

40     As a matter of law, however, such assumption is flawed.

41     Whether the right of forfeiture has been waived by acceptance of payment after the breach depend on whether the payment was tendered and accepted as “_rent_”. The question is whether the landlord, with knowledge of the cause of forfeiture, did anything to recognise the relationship of landlord and tenant as still continuing. This is so even if the landlord may subjectively have no intention to waive his right of forfeiture and even if he accepts the payment “_under protest_”: see _Protax_ at \[22\] to \[24\].

42     Accordingly, even if I am prepared to accept that the Claimant did not agree to the Proposal, there is still a (more important) question as to the basis upon which the Claimant accepted the payment of $6,300 on 27 and 28 April 2022. If the Tenancy Agreement has not been terminated as at 28 April 2022, then on what basis could the Claimant have applied part of that payment towards an “_extension of time to move out of the Premises_” and a waiver of the “_right to claim double rent_”, as stated in the 29 April 2022 letter? If the payments received by the Claimant could not have been so applied, then should the payment be deemed as having been accepted as payment for rent under the Tenancy Agreement? In this regard, I note that the Claimant did in fact refer to the sum of $3,000 payable on 28 May 2022 (if the Defendant wished to extend the Move Out Date to 28 June 2022) as “_rent_” in the 31 May Letter.

43     The upshot of the foregoing is that whether there is a waiver of the Claimant’s right of forfeiture does not depend simply on the binary question as to whether the Proposal was accepted. It requires a closer examination of the factual context under which the subsequent payment was tendered and received, and these are not questions which I would have been prepared to answer on the evidence before me in this Originating Application. I therefore limit my brief remarks on the waiver issue as such.

## Issue 2: Damages to be Assessed

44     As mentioned, the Claimant also seeks an order for “_an assessment of damages on the sums due from the Defendant to the Claimant_”. However, it is unclear from the affidavits filed in this application what these “_damages_” relate to. Mr Hanam’s position (or at least the final iteration of it) is that these “_damages_” referred to the reinstatement costs which the Claimant would have to incur after he regains possession of the Premises.

45     My holding on Issue 1 means that the Claimant would not be regaining possession of the Premises pursuant to any order made in this application. It is not known when the Claimant would regain possession of the Premises, the state of the Premises at the time possession is delivered to the Claimant and whether there would be any breach of the Defendant’s reinstatement obligations under the Tenancy Agreement at all.

46     The claim for damages for reinstatement costs is therefore premature and not an accrued cause of action to the Claimant at the time this Originating Application was filed. It is accordingly dismissed as well.

## Conclusion

47     For the reasons given above, the Originating Application is dismissed in its entirety.

48     This outcome is unfortunate, because the reality of the situation is that the Defendant was undoubtedly late in payment of the April Rent and, as at the time of the hearing before me on 9 September 2022, the Defendant has not made _any_ further payment to the Claimant despite the Defendant’s continued occupation of the Premises.

49     Clearly, the Claimant should have further recourse against the Defendant. Unfortunately, such recourse is not to be found in this Originating Application. This is the consequence of an unfortunately-drafted Tenancy Agreement coupled with the Claimant’s failure to appreciate the legal requirements he needed to satisfy in order to achieve the results which he desires. Admittedly, the law relating to forfeiture and re-entry is saddled with technicalities. But that is not reason to ignore, but motivation to tread carefully and diligently in this area.

50     I will hear parties separately on the costs of this Originating Application.
