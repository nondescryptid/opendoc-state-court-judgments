Contract – Intention to create legal relations

Restitution – Unjust enrichment

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in DCA 18/2020.\]

28 July 2020

### District Judge Lim Wee Ming:

## Introduction

1       The first and second plaintiffs are husband and wife. The defendant was the wife of the first plaintiff’s brother, who passed away. The plaintiffs then approached the defendant to offer assistance. Thereafter, the plaintiffs made mortgage payments and payments in relation to the estate of the defendant’s late husband, for the defendant.

2       The plaintiffs’ claim against the defendant is for the aforesaid payments totalling $220,716.31 advanced on behalf of the defendant, under an alleged oral agreement. I dismissed the plaintiffs’ claim. The plaintiffs have appealed against my decision.

## Facts

3       The second plaintiff is the wife of the first plaintiff. The defendant was married to Tey Chai Bak (“Tey), the brother of the first plaintiff. Tey passed away on 27 February 2015.

4       Tey was a director and shareholder of a Malaysian company, Syarikat Red Leaf Sdn Bhd (“SRL”). The defendant was a housewife and was financially dependent on Tey.

5       The plaintiffs reside in Perth, Australia. The second plaintiff in her affidavit of evidence-in-chief, described herself as “an Australian qualified lawyer and legal practitioner, and with my legal expertise and knowledge, I was able to assist in the \[Letters of Administration\] application”.[^1] The second plaintiff clarified in her oral examination-in-chief that “Although I have been admitted to the bar, I am not practicing.”[^2]

### Plaintiffs’ offer of assistance

6       In April 2015, the plaintiffs called the defendant to offer assistance. The defendant told them that she needed help to pay the mortgage on her Housing Development Board (“HDB”) flat, where she and her three young children were residing. Repayment was not discussed at that time and the first plaintiff’s evidence is that he “Never used the word “loan” at all. Frankly, I don’t use the word “loan” at all.”[^3] The first plaintiff also acknowledged that it never came to his mind that he wanted the defendant to repay. [^4]

7       Thereafter, between April 2015 and October 2016, the plaintiffs made the mortgage payments amounting to a total of $30,407.80.

8       Initially, the plaintiffs and the defendant had a good relationship, with the second plaintiff assisting the defendant to engage and instruct lawyers in Singapore and Malaysia, in relation to Tey’s estate. In August 2015, the defendant and Tey’s daughter from his first marriage, Audrey Tey (“Audrey”), were appointed as joint administratrixes of Tey’s estate.[^5]

9       However, there were disputes arising from Tey’s estate, resulting in litigation in both Singapore and Malaysia. Proceedings were commenced in the High Court of Singapore to remove Audrey as a co-administratrix.

10     In Malaysia, the following two suits were commenced in the Johor Bahru High Court:

> (a)     The first was against SRL’s directors for disposing SRL’s assets without complying with the Malaysian Companies Act. This suit was struck out and there was an appeal against the striking out order.

> (b)     The second suit was a winding up petition against SRL.

11     In September 2017, SRL and its directors entered into a settlement agreement with the defendant, wherein:

> (a)     SRL would pay RM2,200,000 to Tey’s estate, and

> (b)     SRL’s directors would authorise the defendant to sell four properties and have the proceeds of sale paid into the account of the estate.

### Breakdown in the relationship

12     Ironically, the relationship between the second plaintiff and the defendant broke down after this settlement was reached. Essentially, the second plaintiff wished the defendant to pursue the litigation against Audrey and a complaint to the Companies Commission of Malaysia against the directors of SRL, whereas the defendant was worn out by the litigation.[^6] The defendant became less communicative in responding to messages from the second plaintiff.

13     The breakdown in the relationship was very acrimonious. After the defendant informed the second plaintiff on 3 October 2018, not to do any more work on the matter, the second plaintiff responded as follows:

> … I will stop everything and u pay me for all the money that I have put in with interest in 7 days’ time. I will get Geraldine to issue a letter of demand.

> U have no \[profanity\] consideration for the time, effort and money that I have put in and so easy for u to say don’t do anymore? U must take me for an idiot.[^7]

14     Thereafter, the plaintiffs commenced the action herein against the defendant, for the sum of S$220,716.31, comprising:

> (a)     HDB mortgage payments amounting to S$30,407.80, and

> (b)     expenses incurred in relation to Tey’s estate as follows:

>> (i)       S$51,620.45 for legal costs in Singapore,

>> (ii)       RM356,587.77 for legal costs in Malaysia, and

>> (iii)       balance sums for travelling, accommodation, valuation and other expenses.[^8]

## Plaintiffs’ position

15     The plaintiffs claim that there was an oral agreement between the parties that:

> (a)     the plaintiffs would advance the aforesaid payments on behalf of the defendant,

> (b)     the defendant would cooperate with the plaintiffs to keep costs and expenses to a minimum, and

> (c)     the defendant will fully cooperate to ensure and endeavour that the estate matter can be resolved efficiently without any delay whatsoever and hence the defendant could return the total advanced sum after she has received her shares of money from the estate.[^9]

16     The plaintiffs’ statement of claim did not state the date the oral agreement was made and it was only after the plaintiffs were requested for particulars, that they furnished particulars claiming that the oral agreement was made “sometime around May or June 2016”.[^10]

17     The plaintiffs claim that the defendant had breached the oral agreement, in that:

> (a)     The defendant had failed to arrange to repair and clean estate properties.

> (b)     The defendant had refused to collate the necessary correspondence and documents for the purpose of legal proceedings in relation to the estate.

> (c)     On 3 October 2018, the defendant informed the plaintiffs of her refusal to cooperate any more.

> (d)     The defendant withdrew the complaint against the directors of SRL without informing the plaintiffs.

> (e)     The defendant settled the proceedings against Audrey without informing the plaintiffs.[^11]

18     The plaintiffs claim that the defendant was:

> (a)     in repudiatory breach of the oral agreement which the plaintiffs accepted under a letter from their solicitors dated 25 October 2018,[^12] and

> (b)     the defendant was unjustly enriched in the sum of $220,716.31, “as the payments were not voluntarily paid by the 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs on behalf of the Defendant”.[^13]

## Defendant’s position

19     The defendant’s position as set out in her defence is:

> … that there was never any agreement between the Plaintiffs and the Defendant that the Defendant was to be personally liable for the “advance payments” which the Plaintiffs had voluntarily paid.[^14]

20     Alternatively, the defendant’s position is that Tey’s estate is liable for the advance payments, not the defendant personally.[^15]

21     The defendant further takes the position that the plaintiffs had voluntarily paid the aforesaid sum of $220,716.31 and that it was Tey’s estate that had benefitted from the payments.[^16]

## Issues

22     The key issues at the trial, were as follows:

> (a)     Whether there was an oral agreement between the plaintiffs and the defendant, as alleged by the plaintiffs.

> (b)     Whether the payments made by the plaintiffs to the defendant were involuntary, such that the defendant was unjustly enriched.

## Alleged oral agreement

23     In _ARS v ART and another_ (“_ARS v ART”_) <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 78</span> at \[56\], Quentin Loh J held that:

> … an oral agreement is still an agreement … The crucial question is then whether the existence of the agreement can be ascertained from the evidence available, including written correspondence and contemporaneous conduct of the parties at the material time.

24     In determining whether the oral agreement exists, as alleged by the plaintiff, it is therefore necessary to look at:

> (a)     Whether the written correspondence exchanged between the parties, evidences such an oral agreement.

> (b)     Whether the contemporaneous conduct of the parties, evidences such an oral agreement.

### Written correspondence

25     I am of the view that the written correspondence exchanged between the parties, does not evidence the oral agreement alleged by the plaintiffs, for the following reasons:

> (a)     None of the messages exchanged between the second plaintiff and the defendant refer to such an oral agreement. In particular:

>> (i)       Although the plaintiffs plead in the further and better particulars of their statement of claim that the oral agreement was made in a telephone conversation between the parties sometime around May or June 2016,[^17] none of the messages exchanged between the second plaintiff and the defendant in those two months referred to the alleged oral agreement.[^18]

>> (ii)       In the course of cross-examination, the second plaintiff was given time to look through the numerous messages exchanged between her and the defendant over the years, but was unable to find any message that referred to the alleged oral agreement. [^19]

>> (iii)       The second plaintiff further acknowledged in cross-examination that even when the relationship between the plaintiffs and the defendant broke down, there were no messages sent by the plaintiffs to the defendant referring to the alleged oral agreement.[^20]

> (b)     The letter of demand from the plaintiffs’ solicitors to the defendant dated 25 October 2018 did not refer to such an oral agreement.[^21]

> (c)     The exchange of Whatsapp messages between the parties on 18 June 2017 show that the second plaintiff was looking at claiming against the estate for the expenses incurred, rather than the defendant personally. The second plaintiff expressly stated in her message “I change my flight can? \[And\] bill to the estate?” The second plaintiff further stated “the estate paying for my change”. [^22]

> (d)     In her next message, the second plaintiff even referred to her unhappiness about having to obtain approval for her change in flight from Audrey, the co-administratrix of the estate. This is set out in the second plaintiff’s messages to the defendant as follows:

>> If Audrey object, u tell her she very lucky I didn’t fly business class!!

>> Think of her I get angry Liao[^23]

>> …

>> Please slap her for me if she gonna object!![^24]

> (e)     There would be no reason for the second plaintiff to have concerns about Audrey objecting to the second plaintiff’s flight expenses, unless the expenses were to be claimed from the estate, rather than from the defendant personally.

### Contemporaneous conduct

26     Furthermore, the contemporaneous conduct of the parties, does not evidence the oral agreement alleged by the plaintiffs. This can be seen from the following:

> (a)     Neither of the plaintiffs used the word “loan”, when offering to assist the defendant:

>> (i)       The first plaintiff’s evidence in cross-examination was that he “Never used the word “loan” at all. Frankly, I don’t use the word “loan” at all.”[^25] When the first plaintiff was asked “at that point in time, you also never thought that you wanted her to repay, is that correct?”, his response was “\[It\] never come to my mind at all.”[^26]

>> (ii)       The second plaintiff also did not describe her offer of assistance to the defendant as a loan. In cross-examination, the second plaintiff accepted that the sums paid for the HDB mortgage were a gift.[^27] Although the second plaintiff subsequently qualified her answer, she did agree that she did not tell the defendant it was a loan and that the defendant may have understood it to be a gift.[^28]

> (b)     Furthermore, the mortgage payments made by the plaintiffs commenced in April 2015,[^29] more than a year prior to the alleged oral agreement in May or June 2016.

> (c)     The second plaintiff has also alleged that:

>> It was only sometime in September 2017 that the Defendant offered to repay us the monies we had paid for the repayment of the flat’s mortgage loan, as she claimed that she did not want to be obligated to us.[^30]

> (d)     This is inconsistent with the plaintiffs’ claim that there was an oral agreement entered in May or June 2016. There would be no reason for the defendant to make such an offer in September 2017, if there was already an oral agreement as alleged by the plaintiffs in May or June 2016.

> (e)     Similarly, the lawyers engaged to carry out work on the estate commenced work in July 2015, well before the alleged oral agreement in May or June 2016. This is evident from their invoice for work done from July 2015 onwards.[^31]

27     In _Ong Wui Teck v Ong Wui Swoon and another_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGCA 61</span> at \[45\], the Court of Appeal held that:

> Apart from the requirements of offer, acceptance and consideration, there must also be an intention to create legal relations on the part of the parties concerned in order for a binding and enforceable agreement to arise …

> Specifically, where an arrangement is made in the domestic or social context, there is a _presumption_ that the parties _do not_ intend for legal consequences to follow, that is, there is _no_ intention to create legal relations …

> \[emphasis in original\]

28     Taking into consideration the family relationship between the plaintiffs and the defendant, as well as the written correspondence and contemporaneous conduct as set out aforesaid, I am of the view that there was no intention to create legal relationships between the plaintiffs and the defendant.

### Distinction between moral and legal obligations

29     The plaintiffs have in their reply submissions,[^32] referred to the defendant’s evidence in cross-examination that “Even if it is not recoverable from the estate, never mind. If I get the money, I could return him.”[^33]

30     However, this ignores the defendant’s earlier evidence that “In my impression, he was my uncle. So, I feel that since he has helped me to pay, he would not want me to repay him.”[^34]

31     The aforesaid evidence is consistent with the defendant’s position that there was no agreement to repay the plaintiffs. The fact that the defendant would not mind using her share of the money to reimburse the plaintiffs if the plaintiffs were unable to recover from the estate, does not mean that the defendant had agreed to repay the plaintiffs.

32     In _ARS v ART_, Quentin Loh J made the following observation at \[65\]:

> … the statement – “we promised to use their equipment” – may be read as “we agreed” to use their equipment, but it could equally be read to mean a _moral_, not legal, obligation. Further, read in context, the promise arose because these vendors helped them through the tender stage, and that points to a moral obligation.

> \[emphasis in original\]

33     I am of the view that the aforesaid observation is pertinent to our case. The defendant may have felt a moral obligation to repay the sums to the plaintiffs, if the plaintiffs were unable to recover from the estate and the defendant successfully recovered her share in the estate. However, this does not mean that there was a legal obligation to do so.

34     The plaintiffs have sought to rely on the Court of Appeal’s decision in _Teo Gim Tiong v Krishnasamy Pushpavathi_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 15</span>, in support of their argument that the estate could not be liable for the plaintiffs’ claim, as the letters of administration had not been granted.[^35] In that case, the Court of Appeal decided that the representative of the estate was not authorised to continue an action or accept an offer to settle on behalf of the estate, as she had not been granted and had not even applied for letters of administration.

35     I am of the view that the plaintiffs’ reliance on the aforesaid decision is misconceived. To succeed in their claim against the defendant under the alleged oral agreement, it is not sufficient for the plaintiffs to show that the estate could not be liable for the plaintiffs’ claim. The plaintiffs must show that the written correspondence and contemporaneous conduct of the parties support the alleged oral agreement between the plaintiffs and the defendant. For the reasons that I have set out as aforesaid, I am not satisfied, on the balance of probabilities that there was such an oral agreement as alleged by the plaintiffs.

## Claim for unjust enrichment

36     As for the claim for unjust enrichment, the plaintiffs’ pleaded claim for unjust enrichment against the defendant, is on the basis that the sums “were not voluntarily paid by the 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs on behalf of the Defendant”.[^36] This is contrary to the second plaintiff’s evidence in cross-examination, that “I asked her how we could help”.[^37]

37     The first plaintiff also agreed in cross-examination that he was not forced by the defendant to make the payments.[^38] In the premises, there is no basis for the plaintiffs’ claim for unjust enrichment.

## Conclusion

38     In the light of the aforesaid, I am unable to accept the plaintiffs’ claims based on the alleged oral agreement or unjust enrichment. In the premises, the plaintiffs’ claims were dismissed with costs.
