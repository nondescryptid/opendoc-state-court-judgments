Criminal Law – Offences – Singapore Food Agency Act

Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Principles

3 June 2022

### Senior District Judge Bala Reddy:

1       The accused, Ms Noorain Binte Jubli (“**Accused**”), pleaded guilty to a single charge under s 34(1) punishable under s 34(2) of the Singapore Food Agency Act 2019 (Act No. 11 of 2019) (“**SFA Act**”) for communicating “secret” information on the draft joint media statement prepared by the Ministry of Education (“**MOE**”) and Ministry of Social and Family Development (“**MSFD**”) on school closures due to COVID-19 to an unauthorised person, her husband one Khairul Annuar bin Zhakaria (“**Khairul**” or “**co-Accused**”). Another charge under section 34 of the SFA Act was taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.

2       The Accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“**SOF**”) without qualification. I sentence the Accused to 6 weeks’ imprisonment for the charge DAC-916897-2021.

## The Charge

3       The Accused, a 39-year-old female Singapore citizen, pleaded guilty to the charge set out below:

> “You,

> …

> are charged that you, on 3 April 2020, at about 9am, in Singapore, being an employee of the Singapore Food Agency who has information in your capacity as such that would not otherwise be available to you, did disclose that information to one Khairul Annuar bin Zakaria (NRIC No. XXX) (“Khairul”), to wit, being the Personal Assistant to the Director-General of the Singapore Food Agency (“DG”), having access to the DG’s email inbox which had emails containing confidential information on the management of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) in Singapore, disclosed information to Khairul by sending to Khairul via WhatsApp, an image of a draft joint media statement by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Social and Family Development on the school closures as a result of COVID-19, which was taken by you from an attachment in an email in the DG’s inbox, before information in respect of school closures was released to the public, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 34(1) punishable under s 34(2) of the Singapore Food Agency Act 2019 (Act No. 11 of 2019).”

## Facts

4       The Accused was a personal assistant (“**PA**”) to the Director General (“**Director General**”) of the Singapore Food Agency (“**SFA**”) and signed an undertaking on 11 December 2000 to safeguard official information.

5       The Accused was given security clearance for a three-year period beginning in October 2017. The Accused was also given limited access to two folders in the Director General’s email account. The Accused was not able to open “secure” emails in the Director General’s account, although she was notified of its receipt.

6       On 3 April 2020, an email was sent to the Director General’s account with a draft joint media statement including the following attachments:

> (a)     a draft joint media statement by MOE and MSFD;

> (b)     a draft Ministry of Health (“**MOH**”) press release containing the circuit breaker measures; and

> (c)     a draft Ministry of Trade (“**MTI**”) public guideline on the list of exempted essential services allowed to operate during circuit breaker.

7       The Accused took a photograph of part of the draft joint media statement with her mobile phone and sent it via WhatsApp to her husband Khairul, an unauthorised recipient, informing him not to share the image with any other individual. The photograph captured information on school closures. The photograph also captured other safe distancing measures and limits to social interactions.

8       The Accused also informed her husband Khairul of the list of essential services which would continue to operate during circuit breaker (contained in the MTI guideline). On her husband Khairul’s request, she took photographs of the list of essential services and sent a total of eight images to him via WhatsApp.

9       The Accused’s husband Khairul cropped the WhatsApp image he had received on the draft joint media statement and disseminated the image on a WhatsApp chatgroup “_Geng Shaffri_” with 13 members. The image disseminated also contained a factual inaccuracy that the schools would adopt _home based learning_ from _13 April 2020 to 30 April 2020_, when in fact, the announcement in the Prime Minister’s address referred to the _suspension_ of schools from _8 April 2020 to 4 May 2020_.

10     The information on the Circuit breaker was embargoed from being released until the Prime Minister’s address at 4pm on 3 April 2020. The press release on the closure of schools was embargoed until 4.30pm when the Multi-Ministry Task Force press conference started.

## Antecedents

11     The Accused is untraced with no prior or relevant antecedents.

## Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

12     The Prosecution submitted that the principle of general deterrence applied citing the case of _Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> (“**Law Aik Meng**”) (at \[24(a)\]) wherein the High Court observed that “_offences against or relating to public institutions_” such as civil service (at \[24(a)\]) and conduct that undermines public safety, health, services, widely used facilities or security (including public or social policies) (at \[24(d)\]) warrant a deterrent sentence and must be categorically denounced. Offences against or relating to public institutions undermined the “_administration and effectiveness of government policies … imping_\[ing\] _on national/public interests_” (Sentencing Principles in Singapore (2nd Ed, 2019)).

13     The Prosecution advanced four main arguments, for imposing a sentence of ten to 12 weeks’ imprisonment, as follows:

> (a)     The premature leak of factually inaccurate information by the Accused caused public agencies to redirect valuable resources from dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic to dealing with the leak;

> (b)     The widespread economic implications of leaking sensitive information on Singapore’s school closures and essential services;

> (c)     It was essential that sensitive information was released in a manner to prevent panic in the public, including “_panic buying_” further exacerbating the spread of COVID-19; and

> (d)     The need to uphold public confidence that is reposed in public servants as guardians of confidential and sensitive information.

14     The prosecution further contended that the facts of the present case was more egregious than the reported case of _PP v Yee Kok Siong and Tan Bee Song_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 74</span> (“**Yee Kok Siang**”) where the primary offender, a police officer informed his friend confidential information on the arrest of a “Chinese couple” by the Central Police Division. The crux of the Prosecution’s submissions was that the leak in the present case was more widespread (_i.e._ involving at least 18 individual or group WhatsApp chats and social media platforms) and more sensitive as it involved information on the closure of schools and essential services allowed to operate during circuit breaker.

15     The prosecution also cited three unreported cases of _PP v Zhao Zheng_ SC-902388-2021, _PP v Tang Lin_ SC-902386-2021 and _Chua Wee Lin_ SC-903270-2021 involving the premature leak of COVID-19 related information under s 5 of the Official Secrets Act (Cap 213, Rev Ed 2012) (“**OSA**”). The prosecution submitted that the information disclosed by the Accused was of greater sensitivity.

## Plea of Mitigation and Defence’s Submissions

16     The Defence submitted that a maximum sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment was warranted against the Accused. The Defence highlighted that the Accused was a first-time offender, with no antecedents and her conduct was an uncharacteristic deviation from her law-abiding ways as a civil servant with a clean record of more than 21 years. The Accused demonstrated genuine remorse by accepting full responsibility and pleading guilty at the earliest instance. The Accused’s conduct was propelled by concerns for her husband’s job safety and young children’s education arrangements rather than malice to cause harm to the state.

17     The Defence cited four reported cases, _Bridges Christopher v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 3 SLR(R) 467</span> (“**Bridges Christopher**”) , _PP v Phua Keng Tong_ \[1985-1986\] SLR(R) 545 (“**Phua**”), _PP v Fazli bin Mohd Fairuz Shah_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 190</span> (“**Fazli**”) and _Yee Kok Siong_ dealing with the disclosure of addresses of individuals, meeting notes/document between a Minster and delegates from the United States of America, photographs of the Singapore Civil Defence Force call sheet/person hanging from the ceiling fan and confidential information of an arrest, respectively.

18     The Defence contended that the information disclosed by the Accused in the present case was less “sensitive” than the information note (government document) and two Ministers’/Foreign delegate meeting notes disclosed in _Phua_’s case. The Defence also drew numerous distinctions between the present case and _Yee Kok Siong’s_ case cited by the Prosecution including, _inter alia_, the lack of sophistication, type of information (_i.e._ which dealt with the identity of person arrested as opposed to government policy) and the impact of the leak.

19     The Defence also distinguished the facts of the present case from the recent unreported cases of _PP v Zhao Zheng_ SC-902388-2021 and _PP v Tang Lin_ SC-902386-2021 which, _inter alia_, involved multiple disclosures, multiple charges, and greater premeditation/sophistication.

20     The Defence further submitted that the (a) economic implications of the leak were hypothetical and unsubstantiated and that the panic buying only occurred after the Prime Minister’s speech on the Circuit Breaker (b) the “information” was ultimately publicly disclosed and (c) the Accused’s disclosure was limited to _one_ person her husband Khairul.

21     The onward spread or transmission of the information was solely attributable to her husband Khairul.

## Sentence

### Legislative Provision

22     I begin first with an observation on SFA Act. Section 34 of the SFA Act provides that a member, employee, delegate or subdelegate of the SFA must not disclose information obtained by virtue of his or her position to any third party except in certain limited circumstances. Section 34 of the SFA Act provides as follows:

> _“_ **_Preservation of secrecy_**

> _34.—(1_)     _A member of the Agency, an employee, a delegate or subdelegate of the Agency, the Chief Executive or a committee member, who has information in his or her capacity as such that would not otherwise be available to him or her, must not disclose that information to any person except —_

>> (_a_)     _in the performance of the Agency’s functions;_

>> (_b_)     _with the prior authorisation from the Agency to do so;_

>> (_c_)     _for the purposes of any proceedings for an offence under this Act, or any report of those proceedings;_

>> (_d_)     _as required by an order of court;_

>> (_e_)     _in complying with the requirements in this Act for members to disclose interests; or_

>> (_f_)     _as required of or allowed by the Agency, the Chief Executive, the member, employee, delegate or subdelegate of the Agency or the committee member, by or under this Act or any other Act._

> (_2_)     _A person who contravenes subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.”_

23     At the outset, it is pertinent to note two key distinctions in s 34 of the SFA Act when compared with its predecessor the _Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority Act_ (Cap 5, 2012 Ed) (“**AVA**”) s 44. First, is the expansion of the type of information restricted from “_any information_ _relating to the affairs_ _of the Authority or_ _of any other person_ _which has been obtained by him in the performance of his duties or exercise of his functions_” to information not otherwise available to the individual other than in his or her capacity. Second, s 34(a)-(f) of the SFA Act expressly lists out some additional exclusions for disclosure under the SFA Act. For ease of comparison and reference, s 44 of the AVA is set out below:

> “**Preservation of secrecy**

> 44.—(1)    Except for the purpose of the performance of his duties or the exercise of his functions or when lawfully required to do so by any court or under the provisions of any written law, no person who is or has been a member, an officer, an employee or an agent of the Authority or a member of a committee of the Authority shall disclose any information relating to the affairs of the Authority or of any other person which has been obtained by him in the performance of his duties or the exercise of his functions.

> (2)    Any person who contravenes subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.

24     The punishment for an offence under s 34 of the SFA Act is imprisonment up to _12 months_ or a fine of up to $2,000 or both (whereas the punishment for a s 5 OSA offence is imprisonment up to _2 years_ or a fine of up to $2,000 or both unless tried before a Magistrate’s Court with the Public Prosecutor’s consent).

### Sentencing Principles and Offence-Specific Sentencing Factors

25     The non-exhaustive list of offence specific factors increasing the seriousness are (a) sensitivity of information (b) prejudice to interest of the state (including the security, economy or international relations of the states) (c) act of treachery (d) prejudice to the agency (e) personal gain and (f) breach by an individual occupying a position of trust. On the other hand, the disclosure of (a) non harmful or offensive information, (b) information arising from a technical breach or (c) trivial act of disclosure are non-exhaustive list of offence specific factors decreasing the seriousness.

26     In the present case, the Accused was a PA to the Director General of the SFA. The Accused’s conduct of prematurely disclosing COVID-19 related information on school closures “_hindered or impeded public or social policies_” (_Law Aik Meng_ at \[24\]). The sentencing principle of general deterrence applies to the present case (_Law Aik Meng_ at \[24\]).

27     The following unreported cases on the premature leak of COVID-19 information may offer some guidance on the sentences:

> (a)     In _PP v Zhao Zheng_ SC-902388-2021 (“**Zhao Zheng**”) the offender holding office of the government as Deputy Lead of the Data Management Unit of the Ministry of Health (“**MOH**”), on multiple occasions over an extended period of about a month, communicated the number of positive COVID-19 cases on a WeChat group with 49 other individuals. The offender pleaded guilty to 12 proceeded charges and another 12 charges were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. The accused was sentenced to 6 weeks’ imprisonment for each of the proceeded charges under s 5 of the Official Secrets Act (Cap 213, 2012 Rev Ed) (“**OSA**”) with three of the sentences running consecutively resulting in a global sentence of 18 weeks’ imprisonment.

> (b)     In _PP v Chua Wee Lin_ SC-903270-2021 (“**Chua Wee Lin**”) the offender the Deputy Director of the Properties and Facilities Management Team of the National Library Board (“**NLB**”) prematurely leaked information about the Phase 2 re-opening measures entrusted to him in confidence by the Assistant Director of the National Security Coordination Centre in a WhatsApp group with 18 other persons. The accused pleaded guilty to a single charge under s 5 of the OSA and was sentenced to 4 weeks’ imprisonment.

> (c)     In _PP v Tang Lin_ SC-902386-2021 (“**Tang Lin**”) the offender, a secondary offender, prematurely leaked the information of the number of COVID-19 positive cases on a WhatsApp group with five other members. The offender also solicited information from the Deputy Lead of the Data Management Unit set up by MOH to check the status of a person who tested positive for COVID-19 in her condominium. The accused pleaded guilty to a total of 10 charges under s 5 of the OSA including five charges taken into account for the purposes of sentencing and was sentenced to the maximum fine of $2,000 per charge.

28     In the present case, the information disclosed by the Accused was sensitive and embargoed information not only on the premature release of “school closure” dates, but also, the list of essential services to remain open during the impending circuit breaker (TIC’ed charge).

29     The premature leak of this embargoed and sensitive information on the closure of schools and operation of essential services had the potential to prejudice the interests of the state in its fight against the COVID-19 pandemic by causing confusion and panic in the population on the impending Circuit Breaker and school closures which was only disclosed to the public through the Prime Minister’s address at 4pm on 3 April 2020 and the Multi-Ministry Task Force press conference at 4.30pm the same day. The premature leak undermined the integrity and caused prejudice to the SFA. The use of information obtained by the Accused by virtue of her position of trust as an employee of the SFA must not be condoned.

30     However, unlike the _Tang Lin_ and _Zhao Zheng_’s case which dealt with repeated leaks of COVID-19 related information over approximately a month, the Accused’s offence arises from her conduct in disclosing the contents of a single email received on 3 April 2021. Unlike _Chua Wee Lin’s_ case where the accused disclosed the Phase 2 opening in a WhatsApp group with 18 other persons, the Accused’s disclosure was limited to _one_ person, her husband Khairul. It was Khairul who was responsible for the onward transmission of this sensitive information on a WhatsApp chatgroup despite being informed by the Accused not to do so.

31     The information leaked by the Accused in the present case is more sensitive than the Phase 2 re-opening (_i.e._ information on the re-opening of clubs and societies, cinemas, recreational activities and food and beverage outlets) in _Chua Wee Lin’s_ case.

## Conclusion

32     In light of the foregoing, taking into account the sensitivity of the information released, I imposed a sentence of 6 weeks’ imprisonment.
