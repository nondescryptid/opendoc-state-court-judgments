Civil Procedure – Summary judgment – Whether foreign law must be pleaded where it is relied upon as some other reason for a trial

Civil Procedure – Summary judgment – Whether the applicability of foreign law to a claim is sufficient cause to grant leave to defend

21 July 2021 - Judgment reserved.

### Deputy Registrar Lim Mei Yee Elaine:

1       The plaintiff applied under Order 14 rule 3 of the Rules of Court for judgment on its claim for the sum of S$67,647.36 due and owing under its invoice no. 18004558 dated 5 December 2018 (the “**Invoice**”), contractual interest and costs.

2       After hearing the parties, I grant the application. The reasons for my decision are set out below.

## Facts

### The parties

3       The plaintiff is a classification society and is in the business of, among other things, providing ship surveys.

4       The defendant is the owner of the vessel Golden Ambrosia (the “**Vessel**”) which is classified by the plaintiff.

### Background to the dispute

5       The following background facts are undisputed.

6       On 26 July 2016, an electrical fire occurred in the engine room of the Vessel while it was en route to Shanghai. At the time, the Vessel was under a bareboat charter to Aquarius Shipping Solutions Pte Ltd (“**Aquarius**”).[^1]

7       As a result of the fire incident, Aquarius docked the Vessel at Guangzhou Wenchong Shipyard in Guangzhou, China (“**Wenchong Shipyard**”) for surveys, inspection and repairs. Aquarius requested the plaintiff to perform certain occasional surveys on the Vessel.[^2] The scope of the surveys requested by Aquarius is disputed.

8       The surveys were performed from 5 August 2016 to 13 January 2017 while the Vessel was at Wenchong Shipyard (the “**First Series of Surveys**”). The plaintiff’s Marine & Offshore Division – General Conditions (7 January 2013) (the “**2013 General Conditions**”) govern the surveys. On 17 January 2017, the plaintiff issued its report in respect of the surveys.[^3]

9       After the surveys, inspection and repairs were completed, the Vessel left Wenchong Shipyard to discharge her cargo. Thereafter, the Vessel was re-delivered to the defendant at Cosco Shipyard in Shanghai, China (“**Cosco Shipyard**”) on 16 March 2017.[^4]

10     From 22 March 2017 to 25 November 2017, at the defendant’s request, the plaintiff conducted various renewal surveys and occasional surveys on the Vessel while it was at Cosco Shipyard (the “**Second Series of Surveys**”). The plaintiff’s Marine & Offshore Division – General Conditions (1 January 2017) (the “**2017 General Conditions**”) govern the surveys. On 24 January 2018, the plaintiff issued its report in respect of the surveys.[^5]

11     On 10 April 2018, upon receiving the plaintiff’s invoice for, among other things, the First Series of Surveys, the defendant’s Mr Lee Sai Kit (“Mr Lee”) wrote an email to the plaintiff’s Mr Koh Yong Ping (“Mr Koh”) to express his unhappiness with how the plaintiff had performed such work (the “**10 Apr Email**”).[^6] In the email, Mr Lee alleged that:

> (a)     the plaintiff’s surveyor at Wenchong Shipyard had allowed the Vessel to sail when she was not sea worthy and had not gone through a sea trial. As a result, the Vessel subsequently had to be docked at Cosco Shipyard to finish repairs which were overlooked by the surveyor at Wenchong Shipyard;

> (b)     the defendant had spent almost US$1 million to make good the Vessel at Cosco Shipyard;

> (c)     if the plaintiff’s surveyor at Wenchong Shipyard had been more diligent, the defendant would not have had to incur the costs of repairing the Vessel at Cosco Shipyard. All the necessary repairs would have been done at Wenchong Shipyard and would have been for Aquarius’ account and/or claimable under their fire insurance.

12     On or about 10 June 2018, the plaintiff issued invoice no. 18002495 to the defendant for the sum of S$148,731.42 for the Second Series of Surveys.[^7]

13     Between October and December 2018, the parties exchanged numerous emails on the defendant’s request to apportion the bulk of invoice no. 18002495 to the occasional survey conducted on the Vessel’s starboard engine or alternatively, split invoice no. 18002495 into two invoices. This was to facilitate the defendant claiming insurance for the expenses it had incurred as a result of the fire incident.[^8]

14     On 26 November 2018, at a meeting at the plaintiff’s office (the “**26 Nov Meeting**”), Mr Lee requested the plaintiff’s Mr Koh and Mr Tan Hoe Ghee (“Mr Tan”) to split invoice no. 18002495 into two invoices, one for the renewal surveys, and the other for the occasional surveys, overtime work, travel time and surveyor’s expenses. The plaintiff agreed to do so.[^9]

15     Accordingly, on 5 December 2018, the plaintiff issued the following two invoices in place of tax invoice no. 18002495:[^10]

> (a)     invoice no. 18004557 for the sum of S$81,084.06, being the plaintiff’s fees for the renewal surveys conducted during the Second Series of Surveys; and

> (b)     the Invoice for the sum of S$67,647.36, being the plaintiff’s fees for the occasional surveys conducted, overtime work done, and travel time and surveyor’s expenses incurred during, the Second Series of Surveys.

16     In or around January 2019, Mr Lee, Mr Koh and Mr Tan met at the defendant’s office to discuss, among other things, the portion of the Invoice which was attributable to the occasional survey on the Vessel’s starboard engine. Thereafter, they exchanged numerous emails on the subject. One of those emails was an email from Mr Tan to Mr Lee on 15 January 2019 (the “**15 Jan Email**”). In that email, Mr Tan mentioned, with reference to their meeting earlier that month, that “we also expressed that you will do your best to do the claims from insurance and settle with us whatever you have recovered from insurance”.[^11]

17     The defendant made full payment of invoice no. 18004557.[^12] However, to-date, the defendant has not paid the Invoice. In an email dated 10 February 2020, Mr Lee informed the plaintiff’s Mr Raymond Wong that in relation to the Invoice, the plaintiff had agreed with Mr Koh that they would claim insurance on the Invoice and that to-date, the insurance claim had not been concluded (the “**10 Feb Email**”).[^13]

## The parties’ cases

### The defendant’s submissions

18     The defendant pleaded two defences to the plaintiff’s claim:

> (a)     First, in or around February 2020, the parties agreed that the defendant would be liable to pay such portion of the invoiced amount as is allowed under its insurance claim, and only when the insurance claim has been paid out (the “**Alleged Agreement**”). The plaintiff had proposed this agreement in acknowledgement of the fact that (i) it was negligent in its conduct of the First Series of Surveys, and (ii) its negligence had put the defendant in a difficult position with its insurers, who had sought to avoid liability by contending that the expenses incurred at Cosco Shipyard were not due to the fire incident. As the insurance claim has yet to be approved, the invoiced amount has not fallen due.[^14]

> (b)     Second, the invoiced amount constitutes overcharging, is excessive, is not in line with industry or market practice for similar work, and/or is without any reasonable commercial justification.[^15]

19     For convenience, I will refer to the first defence as the “**Alleged Agreement Defence**” and the second defence as the “**Overcharging Defence**”.

20     The defendant submitted that both are _bona fide_ defences which raise triable issues.

> (a)     In relation to the Alleged Agreement Defence, the defendant argued that:[^16]

>> (i)       it has produced contemporaneous documents to substantiate the Alleged Agreement Defence, including the 10 Apr Email, the 15 Jan Email and the 10 Feb Email;

>> (ii)       the plaintiff has not proffered any evidence from Mr Koh to refute the Alleged Agreement Defence;

>> (iii)       the plaintiff owed a contractual duty and/or a tortious duty to the defendant in relation to the First Series of Surveys; and

>> (iv)       whether the plaintiff had failed to conduct the First Series of Surveys with reasonable care and skill is an issue for which expert evidence is required. For example, expert evidence would have to be led on whether it was necessary for the Vessel to have undergone a sea trial at Wenchong Shipyard.

> (b)     In relation to the Overcharging Defence, the defendant argued that it has produced tariffs from other classification societies to demonstrate that the invoiced amount constitutes overcharging.[^17]

21     In its written submissions, the defendant also raised the following unpleaded arguments to resist the application:

> (a)     the application fails _in limine_ because Clause 15.1 of the 2017 Conditions expressly provide that English law governs the parties’ contract, and the plaintiff has not led any evidence on English law (the “**Foreign Law Argument**”);[^18] and

> (b)     the plaintiff has brought this action in breach of the arbitration clause in the 2017 Conditions.[^19]

22     At the hearing of this application, counsel for the defendant, Mr Lim Zhi Ming, Max (“Mr Lim”), clarified that he is not arguing that foreign law provides a defence to the plaintiff’s claim. Instead, his argument is that the mere fact that foreign law applies to the parties’ dispute gives “some other reason” – in the language of Order 14 rule 3(1) – for the plaintiff’s claim to be tried.

23     Mr Lim also confirmed that notwithstanding the arbitration clause, the defendant is not disputing this Court’s jurisdiction to adjudicate the plaintiff’s claim. Thus the defendant’s argument on breach of the arbitration clause is no longer a live issue.

### The plaintiff’s submissions

24     The plaintiff’s position is that it has a _prima facie_ case for judgment since the defendant does not dispute that the Second Series of Surveys were performed.[^20] None of the defendant’s alleged defences and arguments warrant a trial of the plaintiff’s claim.

25     In relation to the Foreign Law Argument, counsel for the plaintiff, Mr Huang Po Hang (“Mr Huang”) submitted that it is not a pleaded defence and the defendant is not entitled to rely on unpleaded defences in this application. In any event, the defendant has not asserted or proven that this case would be decided differently under English law if it proceeded to trial.

26     The plaintiff also contended that the Alleged Agreement Defence cannot hold water in light of the following:[^21]

> (a)     The defendant’s insufficient and contradictory pleadings. Specifically, it is unclear from the Defence when the Alleged Agreement was purportedly made, whether the Alleged Agreement was an oral or written agreement, and what was the consideration for the Alleged Agreement. Forbearance to sue the plaintiff for any alleged negligence in the First Series of Surveys cannot be the consideration for the Alleged Agreement, since the defendant is still reserving its right to claim against the plaintiff for such negligence.

> (b)     There is no consideration for the Alleged Agreement as no negligence can be attributed to the plaintiff for the First Series of Surveys. In this regard:

>> (i)       the First Series of Surveys were conducted under the ambit of the 2013 General Conditions between the plaintiff and Aquarius, and the defendant was not a party to the agreement. Thus the plaintiff does not owe the defendant any duty of care for the First Series of Surveys;

>> (ii)       Art 5.2 of the 2013 General Conditions expressly states that certification by the plaintiff is not a warranty of the seaworthiness of the vessel; and

>> (iii)       the requested scope of the First Series of Surveys did not cover the issues raised in the Second Series of Surveys.

> (c)     In requesting for invoice no. 18002495 to be split into invoice no. 18004557 and the Invoice, the defendant had admitted to its liability for and the quantum of, the invoice.

> (d)     The defendant is precluded under Section 94 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) from pleading that the Alleged Agreement had varied the 2017 General Conditions.

> (e)     The defendant has not disclosed any evidence to show that the Alleged Agreement exists, that it has made an insurance claim for the fire incident, and what the status of that claim is.

27     As regards the Overcharging Defence, Mr Huang submitted that it is not open to the defendant to challenge the quantum of the Invoice on the ground of overcharging. It was the defendant who specifically requested that invoice no. 18002495 be split into invoice no. 18004557 and the Invoice. After the splitting was done in December 2018, the defendant did not dispute the quantum of the Invoice until after the plaintiff’s solicitors issued a letter of demand dated 17 April 2020 to the defendant for payment of the Invoice.

## Principles governing applications for summary judgment

28     Order 14 rule 3(1) of the Rules of Court provides that the court may give summary judgment for a plaintiff unless “there is an issue or question in dispute which ought to be tried”, or “there ought for some other reason to be a trial of that claim or part” (which I will refer to as the latter limb of Order 14 rule 3(1)).

29     It is well settled that the plaintiff must show a _prima facie_ case for judgment, after which the burden shifts to the defendant to show that he has a _bona fide_ defence or some other reason for a trial in order to obtain unconditional leave to defend: see _KLW Holdings Ltd v Straitsworld Advisory Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 184</span> (“_KLW Holdings_”) at \[16\].

30     Crucially, the defendant cannot rely on an unpleaded defence in summary judgment proceedings. This is unless the defendant amends its pleadings to include that defence, or the case is an exceptional one where the court is of the view that there are good reasons to permit reliance on such a defence (such as where the defence strikes at the heart of the court’s powers): see _Olivine Capital Pte Ltd and another v Chia Chin Yan and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 1371</span> (“_Olivine Capital_”) at \[41\]–\[43\].

31     To establish a real or _bona fide_ defence, the defendant must adduce evidence, direct or indirect, which supports the factual assertions made in its affidavit. Bare assertions will not suffice, even if they present a coherent version of events which is logically possible: see _Wiseway Global Co Ltd v Qian Feng Group Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 85</span> at \[33\]. Leave to defend also will not be granted if the defendant’s assertions are lacking in precision, inconsistent with contemporary documents or other statements, or inherently improbable: see _KLW Holdings_ at \[16\].

32     Where the defendant relies on the latter limb of Order 14 rule 3(1), there would be some other reason for a trial if the defendant is able to satisfy the court that there are circumstances to be investigated, especially where the plaintiff has shown to be devious and crafty and where most or all of the relevant facts are under the plaintiff’s control. In this regard, a defendant must show clear justification for his reliance on this ground. A vague allegation that a case needs to be investigated in the absence of good reason would not constitute some other reason for trial: see _KLW Holdings_ at \[56\]–\[57\].

## Issues to be determined

33     Based on the parties’ affidavits and submissions, the following are the issues to be determined:

> (a)     whether the Foreign Law Argument constitutes some other reason for the plaintiff’s claim to be tried;

> (b)     whether the Alleged Agreement Defence is a _bona fide_ defence;

> (c)     whether the Overcharging Defence is a _bona fide_ defence.

### Issue 1: Whether the Foreign Law Argument constitutes some other reason for the plaintiff’s claim to be tried

34     In my judgment, the Foreign Law Argument fails for two reasons.

35      _First_, it is a well-established principle that where either party seeks to rely on foreign law, it ought to be raised in their pleadings as a matter of fact: see _Singapore Civil Procedure 2021_ vol 1 (Cavinder Bull S.C. _gen. ed._) (Sweet & Maxwell, Singapore: 2021) (the “_White Book_”) at \[18/11/3\], p 327. In general, if foreign law is not pleaded, the Singapore courts will simply apply Singapore law, subject to exceptions such as where a mandatory pleading of foreign law is required as a matter of law: see _EFT Holdings Inc and another v Marinteknik Shipbuilders (S) Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 1 SLR 860</span> (“_EFT Holdings_”) at \[56\], \[58\]. On the facts, neither party pleaded that English law governs the plaintiff’s claim. It is not the defendant’s case that any of the exceptions to the general rule stated in _EFT Holdings_ applies. I am therefore constrained to apply Singapore law to the plaintiff’s claim.

36     Mr Lim attempted to overcome the defendant’s failure to plead the applicability of English law, by reference to Order 14 rule 2(3) of the Rules of Court. Under that provision, a defendant may show cause against a plaintiff’s application for summary judgment “by affidavit _or otherwise_” (emphasis added). Mr Lim argued that the phrase “or otherwise” allows the defendant to raise the Foreign Law Argument notwithstanding that it is not pleaded.

37     Mr Lim also argued that there is a genuine reason why the defendant did not plead the applicability of English law in its Defence. That is, the 2017 Conditions, in which the express choice of English law is found, only surfaced in the plaintiff’s final reply affidavit in this application.

38     I am unable to accept Mr Lim’s arguments.

39     Mr Lim did not cite any authority to support his argument that the phrase “or otherwise” in Order 14 rule 2(3) allows a defendant to raise an issue of foreign law in circumstances where foreign law ought to have been, but was not, pleaded. In _Lim Leong Huat v Chip Hup Hup Kee Construction Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 2 SLR(R) 786</span> at \[22\], Justice Woo Bih Li made the following pertinent observations in relation to Order 14 rule 2(3):

> It is one thing for a rule to say that a defendant may show cause against an application for summary judgment by affidavit or otherwise. In such a rule, a defendant need not file an affidavit to show cause if, for example, he is able to rely on the statement of claim and/or the affidavit for the plaintiff to establish that summary judgment should not be granted. _The rule does not necessarily mean that a defendant may say something in his affidavit which is not pleaded in his defence._ \[emphasis added\]

40     These observations make it clear that the phrase “or otherwise” in Order 14 rule 2(3) is not intended to be a gateway for a defendant to raise any and all manner of unpleaded arguments to resist an application for summary judgment. In my view, these observations apply with greater force where the argument in question ought to have been pleaded in the first place, such as the applicability of foreign law.

41     In my view, why the defendant did not plead the applicability of English law is irrelevant to this application. Even if the defendant had good cause for failing to plead this point in the first instance, it was open to the defendant to apply for leave to amend its Defence to plead this point. The defendant did not do so.

42      _Second_, the Foreign Law Argument does not provide some other reason for the plaintiff’s claim to be tried. It is not even the defendant’s case that the plaintiff’s claim would be decided differently if English law were applied instead of Singapore law. Nor did the defendant adduce any evidence to show that the plaintiff’s claim would be decided differently under English law. In the premises, the mere fact that the plaintiff’s claim might be governed by English law does not give rise to any circumstances that ought to be investigated at trial.

43     Mr Lim relied on \[14/4/8\] of the _White Book_, which states that “if foreign law applies to the contract being considered, that alone provide sufficient cause for leave to defend to be granted” (the “**Statement**”). Mr Lim also cited _Lin Securities (Pte) v Noone & Co Sdn Bhd (Klang Jaya Bahru Development Bhd, Third party)_ <span class="citation">\[1989\] 1 MLJ 321</span> (“_Lin Securities_”) as authority for the Statement. However, these authorities do not assist the defendant.

44     \[14/4/8\] of the _White Book_ does not cite any authority for the Statement. With due respect, I am not convinced of the correctness of the Statement. If the Courts were to grant leave to defend simply on the basis that foreign law applies to the claim, this may lead to claims being tried even though the applicability of foreign law does not provide any _bona fide_ defence to the claim or give rise to an issue which warrants investigation at trial. This would in turn undermine the _raison d être_ of Order 14, which is the expeditious resolution of cases that do not require a full-blown trial: see _Olivine Capital_ at \[41\]. In my view, to obtain leave to defend on the ground of the applicability of foreign law, a defendant must show that foreign law provides a _bona fide_ defence or gives rise to an issue which warrants investigation at trial. The case of _Lin Securities_ reinforces my view.

45     In _Lin Securities_, the plaintiff’s claim was for the outstanding balance due and owing under a contract for the delivery of shares of a company which was listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange. In summary judgment proceedings on the plaintiff’s claim, the defendant argued that the law governing the parties’ contract was Singapore law, that the Singapore Stock Exchange had released a directive prohibiting forward contracts or off-market contracts, and that the parties’ contract (being an off-market or forward contract) was illegal and void. In response, the plaintiff submitted, among other things, that the directive had been qualified by a proviso in a press release by the Singapore Stock Exchange. Thus, there was plainly an issue which warranted investigation at trial if Singapore law applied, namely whether the parties’ contract was illegal and void under Singapore law. It was in light of these facts that the Kuala Lumpur High Court held that the claim should proceed to trial if Singapore law applied.

46     By contrast, there is no evidence in the present case that the applicability of English law would give rise to an issue to be investigated at trial: see \[42\] above. _Lin Securities_ is therefore distinguishable from the present case, and does not support the Foreign Law Argument.

### Issue 2: Whether the Alleged Agreement Defence is a bona fide defence

47     Even if I take the defendant’s case at its highest that the parties had concluded the Alleged Agreement, the First Pleaded Defence is not a _bona fide_ defence for two reasons.

48      _First_, the Alleged Agreement is void for consideration. The defendant has not pleaded, or identified in its show cause affidavit, what is the consideration it provided for the Alleged Agreement.

49     Mr Lim submitted that the relevant consideration is that the defendant had agreed to forbear to sue the plaintiff for its negligence in the First Series of Surveys, and that this is pleaded in \[6\]–\[7\] of the Defence. Mr Lim relied in particular to the opening words of \[7\], which state that “_In acknowledgement of the above by the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff’s Mr Koh Yong Ping thus proposed …_”. I am unable to agree. All these opening words suggest is that Mr Koh had proposed the Alleged Agreement as an acknowledgement that the plaintiff had been negligent in its First Series of Surveys. Nothing in these opening words suggest that the defendant had agreed to forbear to sue the plaintiff for such alleged negligence.

50     In fact, at \[6\] of the Defence, the defendant reserved its right to look to the plaintiff for the substantial costs, expenses and fees relating to the fire incident which it had incurred. Thus, on the defendant’s own pleadings, forbearance to sue the plaintiff for its alleged negligence in the First Series of Surveys could not have been the consideration provided by the defendant for the Alleged Agreement. If it were, the defendant would have no rights against the plaintiff, arising from the fire incident, which it could reserve in its Defence.

51      _Second_, a critical plank of the Alleged Agreement Defence is that the defendant had made an insurance claim for the invoiced amount and that the insurance claim has yet to be approved and paid out. However, these are simply bare assertions. The defendant has not adduced any objective evidence, in particular its correspondence with its insurers, to support these assertions.

### Issue 3: Whether the Overcharging Defence is a bona fide defence

52     Based on the defendant’s show cause affidavit,[^22] the basis of the Overcharging Defence appears to be that the invoiced amount is higher than that which would have been charged by other classification societies for the same scope of work.

53     I am not persuaded that the Overcharging Defence is a _bona fide_ defence. The Second Series of Surveys was an arms’ length transaction entered into by the parties. It is not the defendant’s case that the plaintiff had violated the terms of the parties’ agreement on the fees that the plaintiff would charge for the Second Series of Surveys. The defendant has not cited any authority to show that the mere fact that the invoiced amount is higher than what other players in the market would have charged, affords a defence to the plaintiff’s claim, particularly where there is no allegation of any violation of the parties’ agreement on fees.

54     Moreover, the defendant had agreed to the quantum of the Invoice when it requested that invoice no. 18002495 be split into the Invoice and invoice no. 18004557. On the evidence before me, the first time the defendant raised the Overcharging Defence was in its Defence in this Suit, more than two years after the Invoice was issued. The Overcharging Defence therefore appears to be nothing more than an afterthought.

## Conclusion

55     For the forgoing reasons, I grant judgment to the plaintiff in the sum of S$67,647.36, interest on the said sum at a rate equal to 12 months LIBOR plus two per cent from 5 January 2019 to the date of full payment, and the costs of this application as well as the action. Costs are to be agreed, or failing agreement, to be fixed by me.
