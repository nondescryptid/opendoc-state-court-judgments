11 April 2022

### District Judge Lim Wee Ming:

## Introduction

1       The plaintiff’s claim against the defendant is for unpaid freight charges amounting to $23,567.87 under eight invoices. Two of these invoices are for the carriage of four used vehicles and vehicle spare parts from Australia to Singapore. The defendant has a counterclaim for the sum of $74,071 arising from the damage to the vehicles and parts.

2       I gave judgment in favour of the plaintiff in the sum of $10,607.87, after setting off $12,960 in respect of the defendant’s counterclaim. The balance sum of the defendant’s counterclaim was dismissed.

3       The defendant has appealed against my decision. The plaintiff has not appealed.

## Facts

4       The plaintiff is in the business of providing freight services.

5       The defendant is in the business of renting, repairing and servicing of aircraft and air transport equipment.

6       In October 2017, the plaintiff agreed with the defendant (“the Agreement”) to deliver the following vehicles and spare parts (collectively referred to as “the Vehicles”) from Queensland, Australia to Singapore:

> (a)     one used 1977 BMW 3.0Si Saloon (“1977 BMW”),

> (b)     one used 1976 BMW 3.0L Saloon (“1976 BMW”),

> (c)     one used 1973 BMW 3.0Si Saloon (“1973 BMW”),

> (d)     one used 1968 Daimler Sedan (“Daimler”) and

> (e)     one tray of vehicle spare parts.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

7       The Agreement was formed by an exchange of emails dated 4 October, 5 October and 6 November 2017 between the parties.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) The plaintiff’s general manager, Oh Kian Heng, dealt with the defendant’s chief executive officer and director, Kumar Balasingam. In emails exchanged between them, the plaintiff stated that the Vehicles would be lashed and secured in their containers.

8       On 23 January 2018, the plaintiff delivered the Vehicles to the defendant in Singapore. The defendant’s logistics executive, Sabariah binte Kasbola (“Sabariah”), discovered that the Vehicles were not properly secured in their containers and were damaged.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3)

## Parties’ positions

9       The plaintiff’s claim against the defendant is for unpaid freight charges amounting to $23,567.87 under eight invoices.[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4) Two of the invoices relate to the shipment of the Vehicles from Australia to Singapore.[^5] The balance of the invoices are for subsequent freight services rendered to the defendant.[^6]

10     The defendant claims that the Vehicles delivered were damaged and in its closing submissions (at \[51\]), claims a total of $74,071, with a breakdown as follows:

> 
| 

(a)

 | 

Cost of repairs

 | 

$12,960

 |
| 

(b)

 | 

Cost of outstanding repairs

 | 

$21,271

 |
| 

(c)

 | 

Diminution in value

 | 

$39,840

 |

  
  

11     The defendant’s position is that it is an implied term of the Agreement that the Vehicles would be delivered to the defendant in the same good order and condition as the plaintiff received it and that the plaintiff would use reasonable care in stowing and transporting the Vehicles.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7) The plaintiff denies that there is such an implied term.

12     The defendant seeks to set off and counterclaim the aforesaid sums against the plaintiff’s claim.

## Issues

13     The main issues are as follows:

> (a)     Whether there is an implied term in the Agreement that the Vehicles would be delivered to the defendant in the same good order and condition as the plaintiff received it and that the plaintiff would use reasonable care in stowing and transporting the Vehicles.

> (b)     Whether the defendant has proven its counterclaim for damages.

## Implied term

14     I accept the defendant’s case that there is an implied term in the Agreement that the Vehicles would be delivered to the defendant in the same good order and condition as the plaintiff received it and that the plaintiff would use reasonable care in stowing and transporting the Vehicles.

15     The defendant relies on the following correspondence from the plaintiff’s Oh Kian Heng to the defendant’s Kumar Balasingam, showing that the Vehicles would be secured with straps in each container:

> (a)     An email dated 29 August 2017 stating that everything will be packed “professionally inclusive of lashing, securing and manifesting the loads.”[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8)

> (b)     An email dated 31 August 2017 referring to “4 x tie down high strength ratchet straps per car”.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9)

> (c)     An email dated 5 September 2017 stating that “Lashing straps (4 x vehicle) need to be purchased and applied”.[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10)

16     The aforesaid correspondence shows that the plaintiff was to ensure that the Vehicles were properly secured, so that they would not be damaged in the course of carriage. In cross-examination, the plaintiff’s general manager, Oh Kian Heng, accepted that the straps were to ensure that the Vehicles did not move around the containers and get damaged.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11)

17     In the premises, I agree with the defendant’s submission that there is an implied term in the Agreement that the Vehicles would be delivered to the defendant in the same good order and condition as the plaintiff received it and that the plaintiff would use reasonable care in stowing and transporting the Vehicles. The plaintiff is liable for breaching the implied term in not so stowing and transporting the Vehicles, resulting in the Vehicles being delivered to the defendant in a damaged condition.

18     The defendant has alternative counterclaims in tort and bailment for the damage to the Vehicles.[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12) As I have already found in favour of the defendant in respect of liability under the Agreement, it is not necessary to make a finding with respect to the alternative counterclaims.

## Damages

19     In the defendant’s closing submissions (at \[51\]), the defendant claims a total of $74,071 in damages, with a breakdown as follows:

> 
| 

(a)

 | 

Cost of repairs

 | 

12,960

 |
| 

(b)

 | 

Cost of outstanding repairs

 | 

$21,271

 |
| 

(c)

 | 

Diminution in value

 | 

$39,840

 |

  
  

### Cost of repairs

20     In relation to the first head of claim, being the cost of repairs in the sum of $12,960, this claim relates to repairs that have been carried out by the defendant. These repairs were carried out in March 2018 and March 2020 and the breakdown is as follows:

21     The invoices in respect of these repairs were exhibited in the affidavit of evidence-in-chief of the defendant’s chief executive officer and director, Kumar Balasingam.[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16) This claim was allowed as the defendant had adduced invoices addressed to the defendant, supporting its claim for the aforesaid repairs totalling $12,960.

### Cost of outstanding repairs

22     In relation to the defendant’s counterclaim for outstanding repairs amounting to $21,271, the defendant has pleaded that the repairs have not been carried out because of inability to obtain spare parts and the inhibitive costs.[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17) The breakdown of this claim is as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="20.44%"><col width="35.12%"><col width="44.44%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Vehicle</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Cost of outstanding repairs<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Defendant’s pleaded reason for not carrying out repairs</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1973 BMW</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$9,059</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Cost inhibitive<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1976 BMW</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$1,315</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Unable to source spare parts<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1977 BMW</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$4,437</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Unable to source spare parts<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Spare parts</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$6,460</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Unable to obtain replacements<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

23     The aforesaid quantum claimed by the defendant for outstanding repairs, is based on the figures provided by the single joint expert engaged by the parties.[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23)

24     The defendant in its closing submissions,[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24) sought to rely on an extract from the High Court’s decision in _Lo Lee Len v Grand Interior Renovation Works Pte Ltd_ \[2004\] 2 SLR (R) 1 (“_Lo Lee Len_”) at \[37\], where it was stated that “The measure of loss is the estimated cost of restoring the car to its pre-accident condition and would remain so even if the repairs were never carried out.”

25     However, the defendant ignored the next sentence in that decision (at \[37\]) which states that “The plaintiff’s entitlement to compensation was not altered when the car was subsequently repaired at no cost to her.” This explains the context of the earlier extract, which is inapplicable to our present case, where the outstanding repairs have not been carried out, even though more than three years have lapsed since the first repairs to the Vehicles in March 2018.

26     At the next paragraph of _Lo Lee Len_ (at \[38\]), the High Court makes it clear that the court must be satisfied that “the property has been or will be repaired”. The High Court cited the following extract from Neill LJ’s decision in _Jones v Stroud District Council_ <span class="citation">\[1986\] 1 WLR 1141</span> as good law:

> It is true that as a general principle a plaintiff who seeks to recover damages must prove that he has suffered a loss, but if property belonging to him has been damaged to an extent which is proved and the court is satisfied that the property _has been or will be repaired_ I do not consider that the court is further concerned with the question whether the owner has had to pay for the repairs out of his own pocket or whether the funds have come from some other source.

> \[Emphasis added.\]

27     Accordingly, if the damaged property has not been repaired, the court must first be satisfied that the property “will be repaired”, before accepting any estimated cost of repair.

28     I am not satisfied with the defendant’s explanation that the outstanding repairs were not carried out because of inability to obtain spare parts and the inhibitive costs. I am unable to accept the defendant’s explanation as it has been more than three years since the first repairs were carried out in March 2018. The defendant had ample time and opportunity to source for the necessary spare parts and raise funds to carry out the repairs.

29     Kumar Balasingam claims in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief that the defendant could not obtain spare parts for the outstanding repairs for the 1977 BMW[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25) and the 1976 BMW[^26]. This is a bare assertion, unsupported by any explanation. Although the invoices for the repairs carried out on these two vehicles produced by Kumar Balasingam refers to “Parts needed to be supplied by Owner”,[^27] no explanation was given by Kumar Balasingam on the efforts taken to obtain such spare parts, to support his allegation that the defendant could not obtain the spare parts.

30     Furthermore, in the single joint expert’s report on the outstanding repairs, the expert has provided links to third party supplier websites where the relevant parts could be obtained.[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28) No evidence was adduced by the defendant of any attempts made to obtain the parts from these suppliers. In the premises, I am not satisfied that on the balance of probabilities, the defendant will be undertaking the repairs for these two vehicles.

31     I further note that for the 1973 BMW where the defendant has pleaded that the cost is inhibitive as the reason for not repairing it, the cost claimed of $9,059 is not substantially more than the cost of $8,000 which the defendant has already paid to repair the Daimler. The cost claimed of $9,059 is also not a large sum, as compared to the freight charges claimed by the plaintiff of $23,567.87. In the premises, I find it hard to believe that inhibitive cost was the reason for not carrying out the repairs to the 1973 BMW.

32     In the premises, the defendant’s counterclaim for outstanding repairs was disallowed.

### Diminution in value

33     As for the defendant’s counterclaim for diminution in value, this claim was disallowed, in the light of the evidence from the defendant’s Kumar Balasingam that all four vehicles were purchased by the defendant on behalf of Kumar Balasingam for his personal collection.[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29) When Kumar Balasingam was cross-examined on the basis for the defendant claiming the diminution in value of the Vehicles that were his personal collection, he initially sought to avoid answering the question by claiming that it was irrelevant.[^30] Subsequently, he explained that “the company is supposed to pay me a salary and a bonus and every one of these cars are debited to my account. So, I am not owing the company whatever monies that are used to purchase these cars.”[^31]

34     Kumar Balasingam further explained that “When title is transferred, the cars will belong to me. Until the title is transferred the cars belonging to the company … until I pay for the … cost.”[\[note: 32\]](#Ftn_32) In the light of Kumar Balasingam’s earlier explanation that “I am not owing the company whatever monies that are used to purchase these cars”, this effectively means that he has paid for the Vehicles and that they belong to him. Accordingly, any loss from the diminution in the value of the Vehicles would be suffered by Kumar Balasingam, not the defendant company.

35     The defendant has submitted that the plaintiff has not pleaded that the defendant is not the owner.[\[note: 33\]](#Ftn_33) I disagree with this submission. It is for the defendant to prove that it suffered the loss that it is claiming. The evidence of the defendant’s own managing director contradicts this. In the premises, I am unable to allow the defendant’s counterclaim for diminution in value.

## Conclusion

36     In conclusion, the defendant’s counterclaim for the sum of $12,960 for the repairs is to be set off against the plaintiff’s claim for the sum of $23,567.87. Judgment was entered for the plaintiff for the balance sum of $10,607.87 ($23,567.87-$12,960), together with interest at 5.33% per annum from the date of writ to the date of judgment. Parties were directed to file written submissions on costs, if they are unable to agree on costs.
