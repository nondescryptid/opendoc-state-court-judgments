31 May 2021

### District Judge Lee Li Choon:

## Introduction

1       In District Court Suit No. 1362 of 2015, the Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendant is for damage to the boom of the Plaintiff’s mobile crane allegedly caused by the Defendant’s negligence. The case was heard on 9 March and 16 to 20 November 2020. I delivered the grounds of my decision orally on 5 March 2021 and dismissed the Plaintiff’s claim. The Plaintiff has filed an appeal against my decision, and these are my grounds of decision pursuant to the appeal.

## Background

2       Under a hire agreement between the parties, the Plaintiff provided a Tadano Mobile Crane (“Mobile Crane”) together with a crane operator by the name of Liang Ching Weng (“Liang”) to the Defendant to carry out the operation of dismantling the Jib Sections from the Defendant’s Tower Crane on 25 March 2014. The Plaintiff alleged that their Mobile Crane’s boom was damaged as a result of an incident that occurred in the course of the dismantling operation, in which the “outer end of the 35m Jib Section swung out and upwards and came into contact with the top-most (fifth) boom of the Mobile Crane”[^1] (“the Incident”).

## Parties’ Cases

3       The Plaintiff’s suit for damages is based on their claim that it is the Defendant’s negligence in that dismantling operation that caused a dent to the boom of their Mobile Crane. The Plaintiff’s claim is based on the implied term in the hire agreement that the Defendant owed a duty to the Plaintiff to exercise reasonable care and skill in carrying out the dismantling operation.

4       The Defendant’s case is that the damage to the boom of the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane was not caused by the Defendant’s negligence because the Incident did not happen. The Defendant also relied on the evidence of their expert to the effect that the alleged Incident would or could not have given rise to the damage as shown on the boom of the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane. The Defendant further disputed that the Plaintiff has established that they have suffered damage in the claimed amount of $297,800.

5       It is not disputed that there was no Stop Work Order on the day of the dismantling operation and that the Defendant was only notified of the damage to the boom of the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane two days after the dismantling operation.

## The Evidence

### The Plaintiff’s Factual Evidence

6       I will first set out in detail the factual evidence presented by the Plaintiff, the factual evidence presented by the Defendant, followed by the expert evidence presented by both parties respectively.

7       On the matter of factual evidence, it is to be noted that among the witnesses called by the Plaintiff, only the Plaintiff’s crane operator, Liang Ching Weng (“Liang”) and Liton Md Saraf Ali Sheikh (“Liton”), an employee of the Defendant were eye-witnesses who were present at the worksite during the dismantling operation.

#### Evidence of the damage - “red and yellow paint marks” and impact dent on the boom of the Mobile Crane

8       The Plaintiff relied on the following evidence as evidence of damage caused by the Defendant : (i) red and yellow paint marks (“paint marks”) allegedly transferred from the Defendant’s Jib Section to the boom of the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane and (ii) dent on the boom of the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane.

9       The Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane was taken out to the Defendant’s worksite on 25 March 2014 and was returned to the Plaintiff’s workshop late in the evening of that same day. The next morning, when the Plaintiff’s witness, Ng Chin Tong (“Ng”), a senior mechanic under the employment of the Plaintiff carried out his daily inspection of the Mobile Crane, he did not detect the said damage to the boom. The Mobile Crane was taken out to another site for another lifting assignment. That afternoon, Ng received a phone call from Liang who informed him that he noticed “red and yellow paint marks” on the topmost section of the boom. The Mobile Crane was sent back to Ng for inspection. When Ng inspected the Mobile Crane again, he saw “red and yellow paint marks” and “an impact dent on the boom section”.[^2]

10     Therefore, based on the sequence of events, the evidence shows that the damage on the top-most boom of the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane was only discovered after the dismantling operation and after the Mobile Crane had already been deployed for another job. It is not disputed the Defendant was only told of the damage two days after the dismantling operation.

#### Evidence of the crane operator, Liang

11     Liang’s evidence was that when he inspected the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane before commencing work on the morning of 25 March 2014 as part of the Plaintiff’s standard procedure of daily visual inspection of its mobile cranes, including the boom, he did not observe any issues or damage with the Mobile Crane.[^3] During the dismantling operation in which Liang had to separate the Outer Jib Section from the Inner Jib Section, he extended the boom to 56.7m (full extension is 60m). The Defendant’s workers on the Tower Crane “rigged” wire ropes from the Mobile Crane’s hook block to the Outer Jib Section. The Defendant’s signalman then gave signals to Liang to tension up the wire ropes by lifting the hook block and Liang followed suit. The Defendant’s workers at the Tower Crane then removed the holding pins which secured the Outer Jib Section to the Inner Jib Section. Liang then swung the Outer Jib Section to the right in accordance with the Defendant’s signalman’s instructions. As he did so, he saw the Outer Jib Section suddenly swing out and upwards and knocked onto the topmost section of the Mobile Crane’s boom[^4] and he felt vibrations in his operator’s cabin[^5]. When he looked up, he saw the Outer Jib Section was suspended from the hook block in a vertical position.[^6] Nevertheless, despite the occurrence of this alleged Incident, there was no stop work order and Liang did not inspect the boom of the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane for possible damage after the dismantling operation.

12     The day after, Liang returned to the Plaintiff’s workshop and drove the Mobile Crane to another worksite for another lifting assignment[^7]. In his affidavit of evidence in chief, Liang was silent about whether he complied with the Plaintiff’s standard procedure for crane operators to conduct a daily visual inspection of their mobile cranes, including the boom on that morning before driving out the Mobile Crane for another lifting assignment[^8].

#### Evidence of Defendant’s employee Liton Md Saraf Ali Sheikh (“Liton”) who was present at the worksite during the dismantling operation

13     Liton was an employee of the Defendant who was present at the worksite during the dismantling operation. He was called by the Plaintiff as a witness for the Plaintiff. Liton said he was standing on the ground near the Tower Crane and the Mobile Crane during the dismantling operation. He was not directly involved in the rigging of the Jib Section. He said he “_did not look at what happened_” but he “_suddenly heard a loud knocking sound_” and when he “_looked up_”, he “_saw the Outer Jib Section became vertical in position and it was swinging around_”[^9]. From Liton’s testimony in his affidavit of evidence in chief, it is clear that after this alleged Incident, the operations continued as if nothing had happened.

#### Evidence of Kwang Kok Keong Michael (“Michael Kwang”) of Insight Adjusters and Surveyors appointed by the Plaintiff’s insurers

14     Michael Kwang was at the material time, with Insight Adjusters and Surveyors who were appointed by the Plaintiff’s insurers on 28 March 2014 to investigate into the cause of the damage to the boom of the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane. Pursuant to such appointment, Michael Kwang conducted an inspection of the damage to the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane on 31 March 2014. As part of his investigations into the damage, he spoke to Liang. Liang’s account which was in Mandarin was translated by the Plaintiff’s manager, Ivy Yap and he recorded a statement in English from Liang. In the recorded statement, Liang said, “_As I slowly swung the jib to the right over a short distance of about 1 foot, I noticed that the outer end of the 35-metre jib suddenly swung out and upwards. I saw the displaced jib came into contact with the top boom (5th section)._”[^10]

15     When Michael Kwang inspected the boom, he observed there was a localized impact dent[^11] and red and yellow abrasion paint marks around the dent[^12] (“paint marks”). When he inspected the Jib Section, he noticed there were abrasions and scratches (“Abrasions”) at the base of Jib Section (below the base chord members of the Jib Section). He said the paint on the base chord members of the Jib Section was red, but he could see that a layer of yellow paint undercoat had been exposed in areas around the Abrasions. He opined that the red and yellow paint layers on the Jib Section that he observed on 31 March 2014 were consistent with the “paint marks” he had observed on the Mobile Crane boom.[^13]

16     Michael Kwang also noticed black grease marks at some parts of the base chord members of the Jib Section (“grease marks”) which he opined in his preliminary report that “this shows that the Jib Section came into contact with the boom during the dismantling process”[^14].

#### Evidence of Ee Boon Cheng (“Ee”)

17     The Plaintiff subpoenaed Ee Boon Cheng (“Ee”) to give oral evidence in court as he was involved in the investigation on behalf of the Plaintiff’s insurers for the Plaintiff’s public liability insurance claim against its insurers. Ee’s investigation was for the purpose of inspecting the dent damage on the boom of the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane[^15]. Pursuant to such inspection, Ee prepared two reports[^16]. In one of Ee’s reports, it was stated, “_(h)owever before the mobile operator could move the mobile crane boom the 35m length jib dropped and struck the telescopic boom of the mobile crane and then dangled in an upright position_.”[^17] According to Ee’s testimony in court, this statement in his report arose out of information provided to him by the Plaintiff.[^18]

#### Other Evidence

18     Lee Seng Leong (“Lee”) who was a general manager of the Defendant was also called to give evidence for the Plaintiff. His evidence on the alleged Incident was essentially based on what he allegedly heard from Liton and Reymundo Jr Foryoso Cusipag (“Reymundo”) who was the lifting supervisor under the employment of the Defendant during the material time.

#### Summary of Plaintiff’s Factual Evidence

19     In summary, the Plaintiff’s key evidence comprised the physical evidence of the dent damage and the red and yellow paint marks (“paint marks”) on the Mobile Crane boom; the crane operator’s (Liang’s) description of what happened during the dismantling operation; the evidence of Michael Kwang regarding the paint marks and grease marks that were allegedly transferred from the base (the base chord members) of the Jib Section that was being dismantled to the boom and vice versa. Liang’s description of the Incident was purportedly corroborated and reinforced by the evidence of his statement recorded by Michael Kwang, the information provided to Ee and the testimony of Liton.

### The Defendant’s Factual Evidence

#### Evidence of Reymundo, the supervisor and rigger in the Defendant’s employment

20     The Defendant’s key factual witness is Reymundo. He was present at the worksite as the lifting supervisor and rigger during the dismantling operation. Reymundo gave evidence on how Jib Sections are usually dismantled. He described the Jib of the Tower Crane as comprising 3 sections – a 30m jib section (first jib section); a 35m jib section (second jib section) and a 10m jib section (last or innermost jib section). The process of dismantling the Tower Crane involved attaching a 4-legged sling to the Jib Section to be dismantled. The 4-legged sling would be held together at the top by a Masterlink and this would be attached to the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane hook block. The bottom of each sling would then be attached to the Jib Section to be dismantled by a Bow Screw Pin Shackle. Each Jib Section would have built-in lugs. Each of the Bow Screw Pin Shackle at the end of each of the 4 slings would be attached to a lug on the Jib Section. Reymundo said that in the instant case, the rigging was done by using the built-in lugs on the Jib Section.[^19]

21     At the time of the alleged Incident, the Defendant’s workers had already dismantled the first 30m jib section and were in the process of dismantling the second 35m Jib Section of the Defendant’s Tower Crane. Reymundo said that after the 35m Jib Section was rigged securely, he then proceeded to remove the holding pins that secured the 35m Jib Section to the last jib section. Thereafter, he gave signals to Liang to operate the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane boom so as to separate the rigged Jib Section from the remaining jib section of the Tower Crane. He testified that at that moment, the Jib Section did swing which was normal in dismantling operations. However, he did not see any contact between the Jib Section[^20] and the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane.

22     Reymundo disputed that the alleged Incident of the Defendant’s Jib Section coming into contact with the boom of the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane did ever happen. He testified that the Jib Section was lowered safely to the ground by Liang with no incident at all and that no checks whatsoever were carried out to look for damage to the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane boom. According to him, there was no protest from Liang and they proceeded to dismantle the innermost jib section. Reymundo also testified that Liang did not raise any allegation of possible damage to the boom of the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane at the material time[^21].

#### Summary of Defendant’s Factual Evidence

23     In summary, the Defendant’s evidence through their factual witness is that the dismantling operation was carried out uneventfully. There was no tilting of the Jib Section “_until it reached a vertical position_” and there was no contact between the Jib Section of the Defendant’s Tower Crane and the boom of the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane.

### The Parties’ Expert Evidence

24     I proceed to set out the expert evidence adduced by both parties.

#### The Plaintiff’s Expert Evidence

25     The Plaintiff’s expert, Liam Kok Chye (“Liam”), a Principal Consultant of Matcor Technology & Services Pte Ltd, a company engaged in the field of failure analysis and forensic engineering gave his evaluation on the most likely cause of the dent damage found on the boom of the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane. He rendered his opinion based on 2 scenarios – Scenario 1 : based on the Defendant’s expert’s report that the likely lifting positions of the 35m Jib Section were at 12m and 18.6m and Scenario 2 : based on Michael Kwang’s report that the Jib Section had swung and rotated to a vertical position with the Jib Section touching the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane boom.

26     Liam used a computer simulated motion analysis to reach his conclusion. Liam’s analysis was based on the dent on the boom as is, that is, his analysis was based on the assumption that the dent on the boom was caused by the Jib Section of the Defendant’s Tower Crane coming into contact with the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane boom. Using a simulated motion analysis, Liam opined that the dent was most likely due to the improper rigging condition as described in Scenario 2[^22]. He opined that “_the calculations had shown that the lifting conditions under Scenario 2 could result in impact damage on the top right side of the 5th boom section, where the actual damage was observed_.”[^23]

#### The Defendant’s Expert Evidence

27     The Defendant’s expert, Kelvin Koay (“Koay”), a professional engineer, a traffic accident reconstructionist and principle forensic consultant at Koays Accident Reconstruction Pte Ltd rendered his opinion based on information obtained from the Defendant’s employees, Liton and Reymundo as regards the rigging positions of the Jib Section. Based on the information provided to him, he opined that “_the swing angle appear to be small and it was most unlikely to be able to cause (the Jib Section) to wrap over the Boom_”.[^24] He also noted that the locations of the lifting lugs of the Tower Crane’s Jib Section were as per its original design and not any random attachment.[^25]

28     Koay also used the Monte Carlo simulation for “Stress Analysis” and opined that based on his calculations, the “_Stress Analysis results show that any Impact Stress on the Mobile Crane’s Boom caused by the Tower Crane’s mid-jib section impact/contact at the material time would have been way below the Boom’s Tensile Stress_” and that “_the impact force (if any) generated by the Tower Crane’s mid-jib section at the Mobile Crane’s Boom at the material time was well below the force required to cause the dent/deformation to the latter (Boom)_”[^26]. In other words, his opinion was that, the impact force generated by the Defendant’s Tower Crane’s Jib Section coming into contact with or hitting the Mobile Crane’s boom was well below the force required to cause a dent on the Mobile Crane’s boom[^27], even assuming that there was such contact and that therefore, the dent on the boom of the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane could not have been caused by the Jib Section of the Defendant’s Tower Crane coming into contact with or hitting the boom of the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane.

## Issues To be Determined

29     The issues for my determination are:

> (a)     Whether the damage to the boom of the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane arose out of the alleged Incident, i.e. contact between the Defendant’s Jib Section and the boom of the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane and whether the damage was due to the Defendant’s negligence in carrying out the dismantling operation (“the Negligence Question”).

> (b)     If the alleged Incident was caused by the Defendant’s negligence, whether the Plaintiff has established that the damage suffered by the Plaintiff was the liquidated sum of $297,800 which was the claimed amount (“the Damage Question”).

## My Decision

### The Negligence Question – Whether there was contact between the Defendant’s Jib Section and the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane boom and whether the damage to the boom of the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane was caused by the negligence of the Defendant

30     On this question, I found that the evidence did not show that the Defendant’s Jib Section had come into contact with the boom of the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane on 25 March 2014. In any event, the Plaintiff has failed to establish that the damage to the boom of the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane was caused by the negligence of the Defendant in the dismantling operation. The reasons for my findings are elaborated as below.

#### The Plaintiff’s evidence that there was contact between the Defendant’s Jib Section and the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane contains irreconcilable inconsistencies and lacks credibility

31     I found that the Plaintiff’s evidence that the Defendant’s Jib Section had swayed and come to a vertical position and made contact with the boom of the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane contains irreconcilable inconsistencies and lacks credibility.

32     The critical piece of evidence that the Plaintiff relied on to say that the Defendant had been negligent in the rigging of the Jib Section that caused the Jib Section to come into contact with the Mobile Crane boom to cause a dent was the allegation that the Jib Section had swayed and come to a vertical position such that it touched the Mobile Crane boom. It is therefore important for me to make a finding as to whether this did happen. To this end, the account given by the Plaintiff’s key witness, Liang who was present at the worksite when the alleged Incident happened is of critical importance. On this piece of evidence, I found that the Plaintiff had failed to establish its version of facts – that the Jib Section had swayed and become vertical such that it touched the Mobile Crane boom for the detailed reasons set out below.

##### (1)   Liang’s testimony on how the Jib Section came into contact with the Mobile Crane boom is inconsistent with the paint and grease marks

33     In court, Liang gave a demonstration to show how the Jib Section came into contact with the Mobile Crane boom[^28]. Based on Liang’s demonstration, it was the top singular cylindrical chord of the Jib Section that impacted the boom when the Jib Section “swung upwards into a vertical position”. This does not accord with the Plaintiff’s evidence of “paint marks” on the Mobile Crane boom and “Abrasions” on the Jib Section because these are found to be on the underside of the Jib Section (the base chord member at the underside of the base of the Jib Section). The location of the “Abrasions” and the supposed rubbed-off red and yellow paint on the impacted boom surface meant that if these “Abrasions” and “paint marks” were caused by the Jib Section impacting on the boom, it would have been the base of the Jib Section that came into contact with or that had hit against the boom of the Mobile Crane[^29] and not the top of the Jib Section that had come into contact with or that had hit the boom as demonstrated by Liang.

34     In addition to Liang’s testimony being inconsistent with the physical evidence as shown in the photographs, it is also inconsistent with the evidence of Michael Kwang as his evidence is also that the “paint marks” and “Abrasions” showed that it was the underside of the base of the Jib Section that had hit against the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane boom; and not that the top singular cylindrical chord of the Jib Section that had hit the boom.

35     Further, the Plaintiff’s evidence of grease from the boom adhering to the base chord member of the Jib Section also indicated that if there was any contact between the Jib Section and the boom during the dismantling process, it was the base of the Jib Section that came into contact with the boom; and not the top of the Jib Section that came into contact with the boom[^30].

36     Therefore, viewed in totality, the Plaintiff’s evidence through Liang is internally conflicting with the Plaintiff’s evidence of “Abrasions”, “paint marks” and “grease marks” that showed it was the base of the Jib Section that had contact with the boom.

37     I therefore found Liang’s evidence in Court to be wholly inconsistent with the Plaintiff’s theory that there was contact between the Defendant’s Jib Section and the boom of the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane as shown by the “paint marks” on the boom and “grease marks” and “Abrasions” at the base of the Jib Section.

38     As the evidence of “paint marks”, “Abrasions” and “grease marks” was material evidence relied upon by the Plaintiff to support its case that there was contact between the Jib Section and the Mobile Crane boom, this contradiction meant that Liang’s testimony as to how the alleged Incident happened cannot be believed. Alternatively, if Liang’s testimony as to how the alleged Incident happened was to be believed, then the conclusion must be that the “paint marks”, “Abrasions” and “grease marks” had nothing to do with the alleged Incident. Whether it was the former or the latter, I found the Plaintiff’s evidence through Liang on the one hand and through the “paint marks”, “Abrasions” and “grease marks” on the other to be inherently conflicting and contradictory.

39     As testified by Liang himself in his affidavit of evidence in chief, it is the Plaintiff’s standard procedure for him as the Plaintiff’s crane operator to conduct a daily inspection of his Mobile Crane, including the boom thereof, before taking it out for any assignment[^31]. Based on this, assuming Liang complied with this standard procedure, he would have done his inspection of the Mobile Crane, including the boom, on the morning of the day after the dismantling operation before taking the Mobile Crane for the next lifting assignment. I find his silence about the inspection on 26 March 2014 telling. According to Ng, when he discovered the dent upon his inspection after the lifting assignment subsequent to the dismantling operation, he ordered Liang “to stop using the Mobile Crane pending investigations into the severity of the damage to the boom section”[^32]. From this, it would appear that the dent damage discovered after the next lifting assignment was so severe that the Mobile Crane could not be used. However, there was no allusion from Liang that he had encountered any difficulty using the Mobile Crane to carry out the subsequent lifting assignment after the dismantling operation. From this, it would appear that there was no damage to the boom immediately after the dismantling operation to the extent that the Plaintiff had to stop using the Mobile Crane unlike when the damage to the boom was discovered after the next lifting assignment.

##### (2)   Liang’s testimony on how the Jib Section came into contact with the Mobile Crane boom is inconsistent with the evidence of the Plaintiff’s other witnesses, Ee and Michael Kwang

40     Additionally, I found Liang’s evidence through his demonstration in Court to be clearly inconsistent with the evidence of Michael Kwang and Ee. While Liang’s demonstration showed it was the top singular chord member of the Jib Section that made contact with the boom of the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane, the evidence of Michael Kwang and Ee was that the “paint marks”, “Abrasions” and “grease marks” showed there was contact between the base (not the top) of the Jib Section and the Mobile Crane boom.

41     More importantly, I found the evidence of “paint marks” and “grease marks” to be based more on mere conjectures than scientific proof. There was no objective evidence such as a chemical test conducted on the “paint marks” allegedly found on the boom and “grease marks” allegedly found on the base of the Jib Section to show that the “paint marks” and “grease marks” did in fact come from the Jib Section and the boom respectively.

##### (3)   Liang’s testimony is not corroborated by and contains inconsistencies with Liton’s testimony

42     I did not find Liang’s testimony as regards the Jib Section coming into contact with the boom of the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane to be corroborated by Liton as Liton himself had admitted that he “_did not look at what happened_”. As for Liton’s testimony that he saw the Jib Section swaying and coming to a vertical position, it had the same inconsistencies as I have found in Liang’s evidence – i.e., it was the top cylindrical chord of the Jib Section that came into contact with the boom, if at all and this could not explain the presence of “paint marks” on the boom, “grease marks” and “Abrasions” on the base section of the Jib Section, all of which point to the fact that if there was any contact between the Jib Section of the Defendant’s Tower Crane and the boom of the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane, it was the base of the Jib Section that came into contact with the boom and not the top cylindrical chord of the Jib Section.

43     Further, Liton’s testimony that he “suddenly heard a loud knocking sound”[^33] which caused him to look up where he saw the Jib Section being “vertical in position” is inconsistent with the contemporaneous evidence of Liang’s statement recorded by Michael Kwang whereby Liang said, “I did not hear any impact or bang sound as the jib was located quite high up”[^34]. Given that Liang would have been closer in proximity to the Jib Section, it is curious as to why he did not hear any “loud knocking sound” that was heard by Liton.

##### (4)   Liang’s and Liton’s testimonies that the Jib Section tilted in such a way that it became vertical does not make sense

44     In court, Liang did not dispute the fact that the Jib Section was lowered and placed on the ground in a horizontal position[^35]. Similarly, Liton also confirmed that the Jib Section was lowered to the ground in a horizontal position[^36].

45     The Defendant’s expert, Koay told the court that given the technical procedure of rigging using a 4 legged sling and shackle screws, it was not possible for the Jib Section to tilt to such an angle that the Jib Section became vertical unless at least 2 ropes had become loose.[^37] And in the scenario where 2 or more ropes had become loose or detached from the Jib Section (which was not the Plaintiff’s case in any event), the Jib Section would remain vertical. Thus, when lowered to the ground, it would have remained in the vertical position. According to Koay, in the scenario where at least 2 ropes had become loose, it would not be possible for the Jib Section to be lowered in a horizontal position[^38].

46     I accept Koay’s evidence as it is logical and as it is not disputed that the Jib Section was lowered to the ground in a horizontal position.

47     Further, the Plaintiff had not made any allegation that alluded to improper rigging of the Jib Section by the Defendant. The Plaintiff has also not adduced any evidence relating to the Defendant’s rigging of the Jib Section to show that the Defendant’s rigging was negligent. In this regard, I noted that the evidence of both Liam and Koay is that it is only when the centre of gravity fell outside the rigging positions that the Jib Section would tilt to a big degree. However, it is not the Plaintiff’s case that the Jib Section was rigged in such a way that the centre of gravity fell outside of the rigging positions or lifting points.

48     In light of Koay’s evidence that it is highly unlikely for the Jib Section to tilt to such an angle that the Jib Section became vertical and in light of the evidence of both Liang and Liton that the Jib Section was lowered and rested in a horizontal position, I found that it is most likely or more likely than not that the Jib Section did not tilt in such a way that the Jib Section became vertical and hit the Mobile Crane boom.

##### (5)   Liang’s lack of action on the day of the alleged Incident does not support his version that there was contact between the Defendant’s Jib Section and the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane boom

49     It is not in dispute that Liang did not suspect or check for any damage to the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane immediately after the alleged Incident. At the material time, Liang was an experienced crane operator who had been working for the Plaintiff for many years[^39].The Plaintiff’s commercial manager Ngiam Tong Yeow also admitted that he would expect crane operators to report any incident, whether major or minor, in the event of any incident that could result in damage to the Plaintiff’s mobile cranes given that mobile cranes are very expensive equipment and crane operators are well aware of that[^40]. Yet, Liang did not even see it fit to even check for any damage after the alleged Incident, let alone report to the Plaintiff’s management, even though he had allegedly felt shaking in his cabin from the impact caused by the contact between the Jib Section and the Mobile Crane boom.

50     Liang’s inaction shows that it is highly inconceivable that such an incident of the Jib Section swinging upwards and becoming vertical to hit the Mobile Crane boom had happened on 25 March 2014. The fact that the Mobile Crane was deployed for use at another site the next day further bolsters the inference that the alleged Incident as described by Liang did not happen.

51     On the whole, the combination of these factors – (i) there was no stop work order or any check done on the Mobile Crane after the alleged Incident; (ii) Liang did not report the alleged Incident to the Plaintiff’s management immediately after the dismantling operation; and (iii) the Mobile Crane was sent out for use at another site all lean towards the conclusion that it is highly unlikely that the alleged Incident actually happened.

##### (6)   The objective photographic evidence contradicts the Plaintiff’s case of paint transfer from the Defendant’s Jib Section to the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane boom

52     A closer examination of the photographic evidence[^41] of the “paint marks” and “Abrasions” on the Jib Section shows long and straight scratches all over the base chord members. These scratches are not only found at an isolated spot or area. These scratches appear to be more consistent with the Jib Section being dragged on the ground rather than that caused by an impact or contact between the Jib Section and the Mobile Crane boom.

53     In cross-examination, Michael Kwang agreed with counsel for the Defendant that these scratch marks could have been caused by the dragging of the Jib Section on the ground in the process of dismantling the Jib Section into smaller sections after the Jib Section had been lowered to the ground by the Mobile Crane[^42].

54     The objective photographic evidence therefore contradicts the Plaintiff’s case that the evidence of the “paint marks” and “Abrasions” shows there was contact between the Jib Section and the Mobile Crane boom.

##### (7)   The Plaintiff’s evidence is largely hearsay evidence

55     Other than Liang’s and Liton’s evidence, I found the Plaintiff’s account of what happened during the dismantling operation through Lee, Ee and Michael Kwang to consist of hearsay evidence. For example, Lee’s evidence was entirely based on what he heard from Liton and Reymundo. Similarly, the same is the case for Ee’s and Michael Kwang’s evidence. In the first place, such hearsay evidence is inadmissible. Alternatively, such hearsay evidence should not be accorded much weight, if at all.

#### The Defendant’s expert evidence is more relevant and persuasive than the Plaintiff’s expert evidence

56     Upon an analysis and the weighing of the respective expert evidence of the parties, I also found the Defendant’s expert evidence to be more persuasive and relevant.

57     The Plaintiff’s expert’s (Liam’s) evidence was that the “dent damage at the 5th Boom Section of the Mobile Crane was most likely due to the improper rigging of the 35m Jib Section, which had resulted in the CG of the dismantled Jib Section being located outside of the lifting points.”[^43] This expert opinion was rendered based on the assumption that the dent damage found on the Mobile Crane boom was caused by an impact between the Jib Section and the Mobile Crane boom. Based on this assumption, Liam rendered his opinion as to which of 2 scenarios as regards the rigging positions of the 4-legged sling was more likely. The Plaintiff’s expert evidence did not go towards showing whether or not the dent was caused by a contact between the Jib Section of the Defendant’s Tower Crane and the boom of the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane. In this regard, the expert opinion of the Plaintiff is irrelevant as regards the question whether the dent on the Mobile Crane boom was likely caused by a contact between the Jib Section and the boom.

58     The Plaintiff’s expert’s opinion was also rendered on the basis that the Plaintiff’s account that the Jib Section “_had swung and rotated to a vertical position with the left side (relative to the mast being on the far left) falling downwards_” was correct or accurate[^44]. In other words, Liam’s report was based on the fact that the alleged Incident as described by the Plaintiff did happen. In this sense, Liam’s report on which of the two scenarios of the rigging positions during the dismantling operation was more likely is not helpful at all as Liam had assumed that the alleged Incident did happen in accordance with the description provided by the Plaintiff.

59     In contrast, the Defendant’s expert’s (Koay’s) evidence was directed to the issue of whether a swing of the Jib Section could have caused the dent found on the Mobile Crane boom using the Monte Carlo simulation to do the Stress Analysis and taking into account the Boom’s Tensile Stress. Therefore, Koay’s evidence was more directed towards answering the relevant question of whether the damage found on the Mobile Crane boom could have been caused by the Jib Section coming into contact with the Mobile Crane boom. As Koay’s evidence was unchallenged in cross-examination, I found that the Defendant has therefore successfully shown through their expert that the damage on the Mobile Crane boom could not have been caused by a contact between the Jib Section and the Mobile Crane boom.

60     As for the other parts of Koay’s evidence relating to the paint marks, I considered such evidence to be factual in nature as these were based on what Koay had observed on the Jib Section and on the Mobile Crane boom. I therefore did not consider this aspect of his evidence to be expert evidence and did not accord weight to it based on it being expert opinion evidence. In any event, I noted that different witnesses had given different observations of the colours of paint, with some describing the colours as orange, some as red etc. I therefore did not find Koay’s opinion based on his observations of the colours of paint on the Mobile Crane boom and on the base of the Jib Section to be useful. I therefore did not and in fact need not rely on Koay’s evidence on the paint marks to reach my finding that there was no contact between the Jib Section and the Mobile Crane boom as I have reached this finding based on the other evidence.

#### The Plaintiff has failed to show that the Defendant was negligent in the dismantling operation

61     The tort of negligence requires the Plaintiff to prove on a balance of probabilities that the Plaintiff’s damage is caused by the negligence of the Defendant, i.e., by the Defendant’s breach of the duty of care it owed to the Plaintiff.

62     The Plaintiff has averred the following particulars of negligence in support of its case that the Defendant had been negligent in carrying out the dismantling operations – failure to ensure that a proper lifting plan was developed; failure to check the rigging or that the rigging angle was correct; failure to ensure that the Jib Section was rigged in a manner that is secure, stable and/or balanced for lifting[^45]. However, other than these bare assertions as aforesaid, the Plaintiff has provided no details to show the basis for its assertions that the lifting plan was not proper or that the Jib Section was not properly rigged. Further, the Plaintiff has also not adduced any evidence to show that the Defendant’s lifting plan was improper or that the Defendant was negligent in the rigging of the Jib Section.

63     From the Plaintiff’s pleaded case, it is apparent that the sole basis for the Plaintiff’s claim that the Defendant has breached its duty of care is the evidence of the dent damage and the “paint marks” on the boom of the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane and the scratches and abrasions on the Jib Section of Defendant’s Tower Crane that were discovered two days later.[^46] Therefore, other than the evidence of the dent on the Mobile Crane boom, the presence of “paint marks” and “grease marks” and Liang’s and Liton’s testimony of the tilting of the Jib Section to the point of it being in a vertical position which I have found to be inherently inconsistent and lacking in credibility, the Plaintiff had not alleged in its pleaded case or adduced evidence to show in what other way the Defendant had failed its duty of care in the dismantling operation. On the evidence of damage to the boom, I have already found that the Plaintiff has not shown that the damage arose out of the alleged Incident based on my analysis of the Plaintiff’s evidence.

64     In the circumstances, I conclude that the Plaintiff has not discharged its legal burden to prove that the Defendant has breached its duty of care or that the damage was caused by the Defendant’s negligence on a balance of probabilities.

#### Conclusion on the Negligence Question – The Plaintiff has failed discharge its burden of proof that the damage to the boom of its Mobile Crane was caused by contact between the Defendant’s Jib Section and its Mobile Crane and that this in turn was caused by the Defendant’s negligence

65     Based on all of the above and the totality of the evidence presented, I concluded that the Plaintiff has failed to discharge its burden of proof to show that on a balance of probabilities, the Defendant’s Jib Section had come into contact with the boom of the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane. Additionally, the Plaintiff has failed to discharge its burden of proof to show that the damage to the top-most boom of the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane was caused by the Defendant’s negligence in carrying out the dismantling operation on 25 March 2014.

### The Damage Question – the Plaintiff has not shown that the damage sustained is as claimed

66     As I have found that the Plaintiff has failed to discharge its burden of proof to show that the Defendant is liable for the damage caused to the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane boom, it is not necessary for me to deal with the Damage Question. However, for completeness, I examined the evidence adduced concerning the amount of damage allegedly sustained by the Plaintiff and found that the Plaintiff has not established that it had sustained damage in the amount claimed. I summarise this finding as below.

67     The Plaintiff’s claim is for the liquidated sum of $207,800. The breakdown for this specific amount as provided by the Plaintiff is as follows:

> \-    Cost of replacement of the boom - $183,000

> \-    Freight charges for importing the replacement of the boom - $5,800

> \-    Cost of labour and equipment to replace the boom - $17,000

> \-    Professional fees of authorised examiner to certify that the Mobile Crane is fit and safe for use - $2000.

68     The Plaintiff’s claim is on the basis of a total loss which in turn is based on a Service Report issued by Mr Naoki Inoue, a representative of Tadano Asia Pte Ltd (“Tadano”), the manufacturer of the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane[^47]. However, the Plaintiff had not called Mr Naoki Inoue or any appropriate representative from the manufacturer of the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane to give evidence to justify the Plaintiff’s claim based on a total loss or replacement. On this basis alone, the Plaintiff’s claim for damages in the amount of $207,800 must necessarily fail.

69     The Plaintiff’s evidence on the quantum of damages suffered by the Plaintiff is adduced through Yap Bee Ling (“Yap”), General Manager of the Plaintiff and Chong Chaw Fook (“Chong”), a Service Manager of Multico Equipment & Parts Pte Ltd (“Multico”), the authorised distributor of Tadano mobile cranes.

70     I found no basis to accept Yap’s evidence at face value for the following reasons:

> (a)     Yap’s evidence on the quantum was based on the amount charged by Multico Pte Ltd for the replacement of the boom. However, Yap had no personal knowledge of the Plaintiff’s dealings with Multico and was not in a position to confirm that payment was made to the relevant people.

> (b)     Yap did not adduce any supporting evidence in support of the various items claimed. For instance, there was no supporting evidence for the amount of $183,000 allegedly billed by Multico.

71     It was not in dispute that Multico was only a middleman between the Plaintiff and Tadano Ltd (“Tadano”), the manufacturer of the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane. Other than a bare statement that the Mobile Crane boom was replaced and that he did invoice the Plaintiff and was paid by the Plaintiff, Chong did not adduce any supporting evidence such as a PE report, or photographs etc to show that the Plaintiff’s Mobile Crane boom was indeed replaced. In that connection, Chong’s unsupported evidence which comprised only bare statements had to be treated with caution.

72     More importantly, the onus is on the Plaintiff to show that it has taken reasonable efforts to mitigate its loss. The absence of any evidence to substantiate the amounts claimed other than bare statements led me to the inevitable conclusion that the Plaintiff had failed to discharge its burden to prove on a balance of probabilities that it had suffered the damages or losses as claimed.

## Conclusion

73     Based on all of my findings, I dismissed the Plaintiff’s claim and awarded costs to the Defendant. As Counsel for the Defendant had requested for costs to be taxed and as the Plaintiff did not object to this, I therefore ordered for costs to be taxed if parties were unable to agree on the quantum of costs payable by the Plaintiff to the Defendant.
