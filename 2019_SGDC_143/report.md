### District Judge Lorraine Ho:

## INTRODUCTION

1       On 5 September 2018 at about 2.55pm in the afternoon, a rider on a Harley Davidson motorcycle (“the Harley”) was travelling along a relatively busy Tampines Expressway (TPE) towards the Pan Island Expressway (PIE) in the direction of the airport. He was requested to stop by the Traffic Police (TP) officers using blinkers, the car horn and hand signals. Yet the rider did not do so. On the contrary, upon seeing the TP officers, the rider sped away.

2       Besides speeding at between 160 to 170kmph, the Harley was seen weaving in and out of traffic by switching lanes abruptly and encroaching into the path of other vehicles. As a result, the TP officers had to pursue the Harley for at least 6 minutes along the expressways. Despite this, the rider was relentless and refused to stop.

3       In the 6 minutes, the Harley travelled not less than 17km from TPE to the PIE and then to the East Coast Parkway (ECP) just before the Marina Coastal Expressway (MCE). In order to keep up with the Harley, the TP patrol car too, had to weave in and out of traffic at high speed. It was only when the TP’s Special Operations Team was activated that one of their black “stealth bikes” was finally able to catch up with the Harley and stop the rider.

4       This was not a scene from the movies. It was only fortuitous that nobody was injured and no accident was caused.

5       The rider, a 59-year-old Singaporean male, is also known as Robin amongst his family and friends. He retired at the age of 56 years old after serving as a Master Warrant Officer in the Singapore Armed Forces Special Operations Force. Upon his retirement, he pursued his passion for motorcycles.

6       Unfortunately, as a consequent of his daredevil act on his Harley, the accused was arrested for dangerous driving while riding his motorcycle no. FBJ9966C (“the accused’s motorcycle”) on that fateful day. He was thereafter charged under Section 64(1) of the Road Traffic Act (“RTA”) accordingly.

7       On 10 June 2019, the accused pleaded guilty before me to the said dangerous driving charge and was sentenced to five days’ imprisonment with effect from 10 June 2019. Additionally, pursuant to s42(1) of the RTA, the accused was disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences (“DQAC”) for a period of 36 months with effect from 10 June 2019.

8       The accused filed a Notice of Appeal dated 10 June 2019 against the sentence imposed on him. Pending the appeal, the accused has only applied for a stay of the execution in relation to the sentence of imprisonment imposed on him. For that reason, I allowed his application. He did not apply for a stay of the disqualification order pending the appeal.

10     On condition that the accused pleads guilty, the Prosecution agreed to proceed on the 1st charge and take into consideration (TIC) the 2nd charge for the purpose of sentencing.

### Statement of Facts

11     The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification. A concise, succinct and edited version of the SOF depicting the offence of the dangerous driving charge read as follows:

> …

> 4    On 5 September 2018 at about 2.25pm, the complainant whilst patrolling along Tampines Expressway towards the direction of Pan Island Expressway, near to the 2km mark, spotted motorcycle FBJ9966C on the centre of 3 lanes road. The complainant then switched on his blinkers and horned at the defendant with hand signals to stop on the left of 3 lanes. The defendant then glanced at the complainant with eye contact made. However, instead of stopping, the defendant suddenly accelerated away. The complainant then gave chase to the said motorcycle with his blinker lights and siren switched on. At the slip road of Tampines Expressway into Pan Island Expressway, the defendant squeezed in between the two lanes with vehicles on each side and cutting into their paths causing the vehicles to brake and swerved apart. The defendant then entered into a slip road entering Changi North Cres with the complainant on the rear right and the defendant did not appear to be slowing down. At the junction of Changi North Cres, the defendant made an abrupt right turn back into the slip road leading to Pan Island Expressway towards Airport.

> 5    While travelling along Pan Island Expressway towards Airport, the defendant was seen squeezing between lane 1 and lane 2 with car and lorry on both side and was swerving in and out to avoid vehicles causing the other vehicles to swerve away from him. The complainant checked his motorcycle’s speedometer and speed reading was 160kph. The defendant then entered the slip road into East Coast Parkway towards Marina Coastal Expressway and while negotiating the left bend, the defendant was seen wobbling. After the bend, the defendant then accelerated away and was then observed overtaking vehicles on lane 1 and lane 2 and doing so dangerously at fast speed and close proximity with other vehicles, with speed check of 170kph. His actions again caused other vehicles to swerve away from him to avoid a collision.

> 6    The complainant then continued to trail defendant to the 7.5km mark where the second complainant intercepted and continued the pursuit. The defendant was then observed to be swerving in between lane 1 and 2. His actions again caused other vehicles to swerve away from him to avoid a collision. About 1km into the pursuit, the defendant then made a lane change to the left and slowed down. Near to the 9km mark, the second complainant then went alongside with the defendant, gestured and shouted towards the defendant to stop at the road shoulder. The latter complied and he was placed under arrest by the complainant and escorted back to the Traffic Police HQ.

> 7    In total, the defendant was chased by the complainant at high speeds of about 160 to 170km/h for about 6mins. The incident was captured by the in-car camera of the complainant’s patrol car. When subsequently questioned, the accused admitted that, during the chase, he had noticed from his side mirror that a traffic police car was chasing him but stated that he continued to speed off as he felt panicked.

> ..…

12     The video footage taken from the in-car camera of the TP patrol car at the material time was admitted into evidence as part of the Statement of Facts.

### Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

14     The Prosecution orally submitted that on the facts, the custodial threshold had been crossed. Whilst there was no accident caused and nobody was injured, the potential harm caused to the public and other road users could have been great given the fact that the accused was riding dangerously at high speed and weaving in and out of traffic for a long distance to flee from the TP officers. The TP officers too had to drive at a fast speed along major expressways in broad daylight to give chase, putting their own lives in danger. This was apparent from the video footage evidence captured by the in-car camera of the TP’s patrol car.

15     The Prosecution relied on the seminal decision of _PP v Koh Thiam Huat_ \[2017\] 4 SLR 123 (“_Koh Thiam Huat”)_ where it was held that a related and equally important consideration would be the potential harm that might have been caused. This was given that driving is an inherently dangerous activity that can pose serious risk to road users and pedestrians alike.

16     In terms of culpability, it was equally high in this case. As held in _Koh Thiam Huat_, factors which would increase the accused’s culpability would include a particularly dangerous manner of driving. Aggravating factors like speeding, drink-driving and sleepy driving would clearly contribute to this. In addition, if the dangerous driving was deliberate, for instance in “hell riding” cases, this would also indicate a higher level of culpability.

17     The Prosecution further referred to the case of _PP v Aw Tai Hock_ \[2017\] SLR 1141(“_Aw Tai Hock”)_ where it was enunciated by the High Court that the factors which affect culpability for dangerous driving offences would generally include (a) the manner of driving; (b) the circumstances of driving; and (c) the offender’s reasons for driving.

18     Here, the accused was clearly violating traffic rules by speeding at a very high speed of about 160 to 170kpmh. The accused had intentionally sought to evade the TP officers by doing so. There was a pursuit over a distance of at least 17km and for a duration of not less than 6 minutes. The manner of driving by the accused was aggravating due to the increased danger to road users.

19     The circumstances surrounding the incident further increased the danger to road users. The accused refused to stop when asked by the TP officers to do so. A police chase ensued. It was a weekday afternoon where traffic was relatively heavy on the expressways. The TP officers had to chase him for over a substantial distance before they could stop the accused.

20     Finally, in respect of the reasons for driving, the act of dangerous driving by the accused was clearly deliberate. There was no emergency which necessitated the accused’s actions. This increased the culpability of the accused.

21     In the circumstances, the Prosecution submitted that a sentence of at least two weeks’ imprisonment and a DQAC of at least 30 months would be appropriate.

22     In support of its submissions, Prosecution tendered a sentencing precedent table involving cases with dangerous driving behaviour even though no actual harm was sometimes caused as a result:

The offender then drove close to the left side of the victim’s motorcycle and this caused the victim to swerve to the right to avoid a collision. The victim sounded his horn and the offender responded by sounding his horn too, and abruptly went back to the 1st lane behind the victim’s motorcycle. The victim picked up speed to increase the distance between them. However, the offender accelerated and swerved in and out of traffic without signalling, coming close behind another motorcycle, who had to move aside to give way to the offender. The offender then continued driving close to the rear of the victim’s motorcycle and tried to overtake the victim again, but his path was blocked by a van and the offender narrowly avoided the unknown van and moved back behind the victim’s motorcycle. The offender then drove close to the left side of the motorcycle, and the victim had to move to the right to avoid being hit. Subsequently, when the offender’s car was in front of the victim’s motorcycle, he remained stationary for 5 seconds to prevent the victim from moving forward.

23     In its oral submissions before the court, as borne out by the case authorities, Prosecution highlighted that the starting point sentence for a case involving evading pursuit by the police as a consequence of the commission of an offence is 2 weeks’ imprisonment if no actual harm has been caused. The DQAC period ranges from 2 to 3 years. The situation in _PP v Chia Hyong Gyee_ \[MA No. 001/2017/01\] (“_Chia Hyong Gyee”_) was somewhat less egregious as that was a road rage incident between two parties and not a deliberate effort on the part of the accused to evade arrest by the authorities.

### Mitigation

24     The Defence tendered a written mitigation. It also had a contrary position on sentence from the Prosecution.

#### Circumstances surrounding the incident

25     The Defence sought to downplay the culpability of the accused by stating several points.

26     First, the initial stopping of the accused by the TP officers was actually for the offence of having a licence plate that did not conform with statutory requirements (i.e. it was smaller than the necessary size). It was therefore for a very minor offence. In fact, the accused had subsequently paid the fine promptly.

27     Second, on that day, while he was riding, he noticed that a car was attempting to cut into his path and the driver was aggressively signalling to him, through the use of blinkers, honking and hand signals, to stop his car on the left of the 3 lanes that he was riding in. Momentarily overcome by shock and panic, the accused decided to overtake the said car and ride off as fast as he could.

28     Thereafter, the accused was greeted by the sound of sirens and more honking. However, at that moment, he was still in a state of shock. He was also unable to hear anything clearly while riding as he had hearing difficulties. Thus, he sped off, sliding between vehicles whenever possible as an attempt to shake off the police. At that moment, he was fully immersed with escaping.

29     Subsequently, from the mirror of his motorcycle, the accused noticed that another motorcycle was following him. The rider was gesturing and shouting for him to stop at the road shoulder. This time, the accused immediately complied with the instructions given to him and stopped at the road shoulder where he was then escorted back to the TP Headquarters (HQ) where he co-operated fully thereafter.

#### Personal circumstances and medical condition of the accused

30     The accused is happily married to his wife. She is 52 years old. They have a 24-year-old son. They are currently staying together with his aged mother and a helper. As mentioned earlier, the accused was a Master Warrant Officer in the Singapore Armed Forces Special Operations Force, having retired 3 years’ ago after having been in the military service for 38 years. The awards received by him during his years of service were enclosed as part of his mitigation.

31     The accused has a love for motorcycles. He bought the Harley after saving for a long time. His passion continued during his retirement.

32     At the same time, despite being retired, the accused was still mainly in charge of supporting his household, which includes the fees for the helper and medical expenses for himself and his wife, who is a breast cancer survivor. His son is currently working as a product sales promoter and will not be able to handle expenses as huge as the ones the accused is facing.

33     Unfortunately, due to the stresses he faced at work in the army, he became a heavy smoker. The prolonged heavy smoking substantially damaged his lungs. As a result, the accused currently suffers from Stage 4 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a lung disease characterized by chronic obstruction of lung airflow that interferes with normal breathing and is not fully reversible.

34     Defence submitted a medical report dated 6 November 2017 by Dr Lau Te Neng from the Radiology and Nuclear Medicine Department of Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. It was stated in the said report that both the accused’s lungs were hyper-inflated with flattened diaphragms that were compatible with Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease.

35     Furthermore, in another medical report dated 22 November 2017 by Dr Chew Hock Chin from Respiratory Medical Associates (RMA), it was diagnosed that the accused has issues of chronic dyspnoea, wheeze and cough for many years. He too noted that the accused has been diagnosed with COPD at Changi General Hospital (CGH). Dr Chew Hock Chin further recommended surgery.

36     On 24th December 2017, the visited Changi General Hospital and went through a series of tests and checks that showed that he now suffers from hypertension. This is evidenced by the medical reports of RMA and CGH. Therefore, this seems to suggest that in a short period of 7 months, his condition had worsened.

37     Next, things went downhill for the accused since the day of the offence. According the medical memo dated 31 October 2018 by Dr Jagadesan Raghuram from CGH, the accused is still suffering from advanced stage Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) with chronic respiratory failure needing long-term continuous oxygen therapy on a daily basis for at least 12 hours per day and hypertension. The accused did not undergo surgery despite earlier recommendations to do so.

38     In fact, on 12 February 2019, he was hospitalised due to lung infection (pneumonia) as a result of his ongoing COPD. The degree of damage to his lungs is now so severe that he was recommended to go for a lung transplant. A medical report dated 2 April 2019, by Dr Tay Tunn Ren indicating the above was produced to the court.

39     Another reason raised by the Defence why the accused was not suited for prison life is because the accused is unable to sleep properly due to dyspnoea. In the circumstances, the accused is aided to sleep every night with an air concentrator to supply oxygen. The air concentrator does not require a compressed air tank inside as it converts the surrounding air to 95% oxygen for the user. It is also a key item in the accused’s weekly physiotherapy at CGH.

40     As stated in the medical report by CGH, Defence raised the concern that the accused requires a long-term continuous oxygen therapy on a daily basis for at least 12 hours per day. Moreover, he would experience discomfort during the therapy. After he was discharged from hospital due to pneumonia, the accused even requires the use of the air concentrator during the day as well as when he is sleeping.

41     After the accident, the accused raised the concern that he was unable to hear the police siren. Worried that this might be a cause of concern, he researched on the possible cause of his symptoms and found out that people with high-frequency hearing loss may struggle to understand speech as consonant letters such as F, H, and S are of high frequencies and thus may be difficult for them to hear. The accused then decided to go for a hearing assessment.

42     According to the results of the hearing assessment dated 31st January 2019 by Clinical Audiologist Daris Tanciano of Digisound Hearing, the accused was diagnosed with high frequency hearing loss in both ears, which was sensorineural in nature. The results of the hearing assessment took the accused by surprise and he found it hard to come to terms with the fact that he is partially deaf.

43     In light of this, Defence suggested the possibility that the accused had failed to stop upon hearing the police siren was simply because he was unable to correctly perceive it as it was. Furthermore, his hearing loss might have influenced his ability to process information accurately and thus resulting in him panicking that day and he decided to escape.

44     Additionally, after the offence and during a recent medical check-up, the doctors from CGH detected that the accused’s prostate was enlarged. He underwent a day surgery for a biopsy to be done on the prostate area on 13 May 2019. The results of the biopsy came out on 31 May 2019 and the accused was unfortunately informed that there were cancer cells present in his left prostate.

45     The accused has been scheduled to do a bone scan, as well as a Computerized Tomography (CT) scan to determine the stage of cancer. The dates were as follows:

> i.     19th June - SGH Bone Scan

> ii.     20th June - CGH MRI Scan

> iii.     27th June - Scan Results

46     In light of the above, the Defence emphasized that the accused’s various medical conditions of COPD, hypertension, hearing loss, as well as his recently diagnosed prostate cancer heavily suggested that he would require extensive medical care and attention as well as frequent visits to the hospital. This would prove to be difficult should he even be imprisoned. It therefore urged the court not to impose a custodial sentence.

#### Guilt and remorse

47     Defence counsel submitted that the accused understood the seriousness of his offences and has always been a strong advocate against it. The accused was sincerely apologetic over the danger that he might have posed to his fellow motorists. This was indeed a one-off aberration where his judgement was momentarily clouded by his panic attack. He sincerely regretted his actions and was deeply remorseful.

48     Moreover, the accused was a responsible individual. Whilst he did initially fail to comply with the instructions given by the TP officers, he is now terribly apologetic for his actions as they were borne out of confusion and distress by the circumstances as well as his own panic. He immediately offered full cooperation as soon as he was stopped subsequently. He sincerely apologised for actions. A week after the incident, he was fined for his licence plate which did not fit the regulatory requirements. Nonetheless, he had acknowledged this without any dispute and paid the fine promptly.

49     Defence also highlighted that the accused had a relatively clean traffic record. As mentioned earlier, he had received certificates and awards from the army as a reflection of his good character. This has been supported by the certificates and letters as follows:

> i.     Military Service Records - Long Service Awards, SAF Service Medals, Foreign Service Medals etc.;

> ii.     Chief of Army - Certificate of Appreciation for Military Service;

> iii.     President Tony Tan - Certificate of Appreciation for Military Service;

> iv.     ISAF Sectary General – Certificate for Non Article 5 NATO Medal; and

> v. Chief of Defence Force - Afghanistan Deployment letter.

50     Furthermore, there were numerous testimonials written by his commanders from the Special Operations Force and Special Operations Task Force.

#### Defence’s position on sentence

51     The Defence sought, in particular, for an appropriate fine and disqualification period.

52     The Defence submitted a sentencing precedent table as follows in support of its position that the custodial threshold had not been crossed in this case:

![]([2019] SGDC 0143_Image/[2019] SGDC 0143_image1.png)

![]([2019] SGDC 0143_Image/[2019] SGDC 0143_image8.png)

53     In terms of the harm caused, Defence submitted that it was low or not at all since no accident or injury was caused in this case. Defence made reference to _Koh Thiam Huat_ at \[42\] where it was held that a fine would suffice where there is a low level of harm caused by the offence or none at all and the accused’s culpability is also low. Here, unlike _Koh Thiam Huat_, the culpability of the present accused was on the lower side of the spectrum.

54     Defence acknowledged that in _Koh Thiam Huat_, See J further stated at \[41\] that a related and equally important consideration would be the potential harm that might have resulted, given that driving is an inherently dangerous activity that can pose serious risk to road users and pedestrians alike.

55     However, unlike _Aw Tai Hock_, Defence argued that the potential harm that might be caused in the accused’s case was considered to be low as well. In _Aw Tai Hock_, it was held that the accused’s extremely dangerous manner of driving could pose much danger to the public in a residential and school zone. The fortuity that people on the roads had escaped unscathed could not have been a mitigating factor. Steven Chong JA noted that it was fortunate that some pedestrians managed to jump out of harm’s way and that the presence of a lamp post had prevented the white car from hitting a pedestrian. Hence, the potential harm and significant risks caused by the accused in that case could not be ignored and should be reflected in that accused’s sentence.

56     In the present case, the accused did not drive aggressively and dangerously within residential and school zones or posed a huge amount of danger to the pedestrians. There were thus no such risks present on the expressways.

57     Moreover, the accused in _Aw Tai Hock_ had failed to slow down at 11 speed bumps and five “stop” lines throughout the entire incident. He had almost collided with a lamp post. He even travelled against the flow of traffic in this deliberate car chase. In the process of evading the accused’s taxi, the other vehicle eventually collided into a stationary white car which then flipped over. The accused did not even bother to stop to see whether the innocent driver of the white car needed assistance. The accused’s actions were simply a blatant disregard of numerous traffic rules. The accused’s manner of driving was intentional, deliberate and vengeful, using his taxi as a weapon on the public roads. This was thus an extremely aggravated instance of dangerous driving.

58     In contrast, the act of dangerous driving for the present case by the accused was not intentional but borne out of panic in an attempt to evade pursuit. Therefore, unlike in _Aw Tai Hock_ where harm was determined to be moderate, here even the potential harm should be low.

59     In terms of culpability, Defence relied on the case of _PP v Cheah Yean King, Winnie_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 177</span> (_“Winnie Cheah”)_ at \[19\] for the proposition that the act of speeding by the accused when evading the TP officers should not be taken as an aggravating factor as this was the very act which gave rise to his liability under s64(1) of the RTA to begin with. In _Winnie Cheah_, it was held by the District Court that the act of beating the red light should not be treated as an aggravating factor as this was the dangerous act in itself which had given rise to the dangerous driving charge. Moreover, in _Winnie Cheah_, the accused was traced with 9 relevant compounded traffic offences and low degree of harm was caused. Yet, only a fine with the relevant disqualification order was imposed on her.

60     In another case of _Lim Hong Eng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGHC 92</span> at \[4\], it was held that a long custodial sentence for a traffic offence would only be appropriate when the offender had endangered the lives of others in a rash or reckless manner and not when the offender’s conduct was merely negligent. Here, a high fine and relatively long disqualification were imposed on the accused. Another similar case was _Chung Tuck Kwai v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] SGHC 163</span>.

61     Defence further sought to distinguish the facts in _PP v Johnny Shang Chia Hui_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 64</span> (“Johnny”) from the present accused’s case. In _Johnny_, the accused had deliberately and repeatedly encroached into the other party’s path and had used his vehicle for the purposes of provocation and intimidation. It was therefore held that his culpability was high. Consequently, he was sentenced to 2 weeks’ imprisonment.

62     On the contrary, in the present case, the accused did not speed with the intention to hurt or cause any inconvenience to others. He was acting in fear and panic. He was simply under the impression that he was being chased and thus instinctively reacted to remove himself from the situation in order to avoid the police.

63     Culpability here was low too because the accused:

> a.     Did not ride his motorcycle under the influence of alcohol. Neither was he using the mobile telephone while riding at the material time;

> b.     The accused had a licence and was not riding under disqualification; and

> c.     At that moment in time, the accused was unaware of the risks and consequences that might arise from his actions.

64     Ultimately, even though the accused had traffic-related antecedents, these were compounded offences and were rather dated. He had effectively kept a clean record. This was as such a one-off aberration committed by the accused in a momentarily state of panic and misjudgement.

65     Alternatively, the Defence requested for a Community-Based Sentence (CBS) to be imposed on the accused given the accused’s ill health.

66     Defence counsel relied on the case of _Chew Soo Chun v PP_ and another appeal <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 6</span> (“_Chew_”), where it was held that ill health was relevant to sentencing in two conceptually distinct ways: Firstly, it could be a ground for the exercise of judicial mercy, where the court was compelled by humanitarian considerations arising from exceptional circumstances to order the minimum imprisonment term or a non-custodial sentence. Secondly, it existed as a mitigating factor and this included cases which involved the markedly disproportionate impact of an imprisonment term on an offender by reason of his ill health (at \[38\] and \[41\]).

67     Defence further highlighted at \[29\] in _Chew_, where Chao Hick Tin JA opined that aside from cases falling within the realm of the exceptional, there are also cases where a term of incarceration would cause an offender a greater and disproportional impact because of his ill health than it would on an ordinary person who is not suffering from the same medical condition. Chao JA further went on to explain that the principle of proportionality will apply in such cases such that the court will need to consider how to adjust the sentence with a view to equalising the burden, even though the court cannot and will not exercise judicial mercy.

68     In the medical report provided by Dr Chew Huck Chin, he was of the opinion that the accused has potential to develop breathing difficulties and exacerbations which may be triggered by infections, weather changes and inhaled irritants in the environment. As such, Defence counsel submit that, taking his medical conditions into consideration, there was a high possibility that the accused’s condition could take a turn for the worse should he be incarcerated.

69     Defence emphasised that the medical condition of the accused in _Chew_ was somewhat similar in nature to the present accused’s condition. They both required regular follow-up visits to the doctors and had to undergo Continuous Positive Air Pressure treatment during sleep time. Surgery had also been recommended to treat existing ailments.

70     Next, Defence referred to the case of _PP v Teo Chang Heng_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 315</span> (“Teo Chang Heng”) on the appropriateness of CBS options. In that case, the accused was sentenced to a short detention order of 10 days and a community service order of 120 hours to be performed within a year. The accused pleaded guilty to a charge under s426 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (PC) for causing damage to a vehicle belonging to his spouse which was being driven by his spouse’s boyfriend out of anger at the material time.

71     It also referred to the case of _Sim Wen Yi Ernest v PP_ \[2016\] 5 SLR (“_Sim Wen Yi Ernest_”) where it was held by See J at \[33\] that the CBS options were introduced to allow greater flexibility in balancing the various sentencing principles in individual cases. In that case, the accused was 25 years old at the material time. He pleaded guilty to three charges for (a) importing an airsoft pistol under s13(1)(b) of the Arms and Explosives Act (Cap 13, 2003 Rev Ed) (“AEA”); (b) having possession of an air softgun under s13(1)(a) of the AEA; and (c) voluntarily causing hurt using an airsoft gun under s324 of the PC. He was imposed a fine for each of the AEA charges. As for the s324 PC charge, he was sentenced to a short detention order of one week and a community service order of 150 hours to be performed within six months.

72     As such, Defence urged the court to consider that not every offender should be imprisoned and community resources should be harnessed in appropriate cases. In the accused’s case, it was once again reiterated that his momentary lapse was borne out of fear and panic. His hard of hearing did not aid his cause. Besides having a good character and a largely clean driving record, he had also, in remorse, sold his motorcycle.

73     In view of the above, as well as his medical condition, it would be highly unlikely for him to reoffend. A custodial sentence, if imposed, would prove to be difficult for him given his constant need for medical care and attention as well as his COPD condition. Furthermore, the accused has never been sentenced to imprisonment previously. His family is extremely supportive of him. Hence, Defence submitted that this was a relatively strong case for CBS to be considered.

### Reply by the Prosecution

74     One of the points canvased by the Defence was that when the accused was being detained in the lock-up at the Traffic Police HQ after his arrest on 5 September 2018, he had difficulty breathing and a medic who had examined him concluded that the lock-up had insufficient ventilation, thereby causing his discomfort.

75     Contrary to the Defence’s concern that health wise, the accused would not be able to endure the rigours of a custodial sentence, the Prosecution reiterated that despite the accused’s medical condition, this would not be the case. The Singapore Prison Service or Prisons has confirmed that it is able to accommodate the accused given the medical expertise available in spite of his medical condition.

76     On top of that, this was clearly not an exceptional case where judicial mercy should be exercised by the court based on the accused’s current medical condition.

77     The present offence was additionally not one that is suitable for CBS to be considered, particularly given the type of offence, the manner in which the offence was committed and the accused’s profile. There was a greater need for both deterrence and the protection of public interest.

78     The accused had sought to escape from the TP officers and such an act is at the very least equally egregious as a road rage situation, if not more. He is also not a young offender. Finally, in coming to its position on sentence, the Prosecution had already taken into account the accused’s medical condition as a mitigating factor.

### Reasons for Sentence

79     Section 64(1) of the RTA states:

> Reckless or dangerous driving

> 64.—(1)    If any person drives a motor vehicle on a road recklessly, or at a speed or in a manner which is dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the nature, condition and use of the road, and the amount of traffic which is actually at the time, or which might reasonably be expected to be, on the road, he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both.

80     For the disqualification period, pursuant to s42(1) of the RTA:

> Disqualification for offence

> 42.— (1)    A court before which a person is convicted of any offence in connection with the driving of a motor vehicle may, in any case except where otherwise expressly provided by this Act and shall, where so required by this Act, order him to be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for life or for such period as the court may think fit.

81     The key issue for the court’s determination was whether the custodial threshold had been crossed for the offence of dangerous driving in view of the accused’s actions in the present case.

82     At the outset, I agreed with both the Prosecution and Defence that the High Court decision of _Koh Thiam Huat_ has set out the two principal parameters to which a sentencing court should have regard in evaluating the seriousness of a crime, which is applicable to a traffic offence, and they are:

> a.     harm caused by the offence; and

> b.     the accused’s culpability.

83     See Kee Oon J held at \[41\] that “harm” is a measure of the injury which has been caused to society by the commission of the offence and “culpability” is a measure of the degree of blameworthiness disclosed by an offender’s actions and is measured chiefly in relation to the extent and manner of the offender’s involvement in the criminal act. Aside from these two principal parameters, the court should also have regard to other mitigating and aggravating factors which do not directly relate to the commission of the offence _per se_. They could include the accused’s driving record as well as his remorse or lack thereof.

84     With the sentencing parameters in mind, I then analysed the facts of the present case in coming to my decision on the appropriate sentence to be imposed.

#### Whether the custodial threshold had been crossed

#### Harm caused by the offence

85     Fortuitously, there was no actual harm caused by the incident. I agreed with both the Prosecution and Defence that as per what has been held in _Koh Thiam Huat_, potential harm that might have been caused by the incident is an equally important consideration.

86     However, I disagreed with the Defence that the potential harm here was low. I was of the same opinion with the Prosecution that the potential harm that could have been caused to the TP officers, the public and other road users was great given the manner of driving by the accused and duration of the pursuit by the TP officers over a considerable distance on a few expressways in broad daylight.

87     Admittedly, this was self-evident from the video footage which captured the entire incident.

88     There was truly no basis for the accused to have committed such an overt act, particularly over a minor transgression. The TP officers had stopped him to conduct a spot check as there appeared to have been modifications done on his Harley which did not comply with regulatory requirements. Yet, the accused persisted. He only stopped when the TP patrol bike finally caught up with him.

89     In _Chia Hyong Gyee_, there was no actual harm caused too. Yet, after having evaluated the factual matrix of the incident in that case, the High Court ruled that the potential for serious harm was high. This included the accused’s manner of driving which was exceedingly dangerous, having regard to the traffic conditions along the PIE at the material time. The accused was also engaged in a series of deplorable manoeuvres that included tailgating, straddling lanes and weaving in between traffic for about 2.5 minutes. It was fortunate that other vehicles were not involved in a collision with the accused’s vehicle: see oral grounds of MA No. 001/2017/01.

90     In _Johnny_, once again, no actual harm was caused. The accused had, with his son in his car, when he pursued the victim’s car along the Central Expressway (CTE) for about 4 minutes and the vehicles almost had a near accident with each other. The District Court held that, similar to _Chia Hyong Gyee_, potential harm caused in such factually analogous situations was high.

91     In _Aw Tai Hock_, whilst the actual harm caused was held to be one of moderate, the High Court held at \[62\] that the potential harm and significant risks caused by the accused could not be ignored as his dangerous manner of driving posed much danger to the public in a residential and school zone. The fortuity that pedestrians had escaped unscathed could not be a mitigating factor.

92     Comparable to our present case, in order to flee from the TP officers, the accused was captured to have sped at about 80 to 90kmph above the speed limit of the expressways. This was at least double than the speed limit allowed. He swerved lanes abruptly multiple times and encroached into the path of several vehicles at close distance in high speed. Motorists on the road had to take actual evasive action to avoid a collision with the accused.

93     Even the TP patrol car had to speed up, manoeuvre through the traffic by overtaking other vehicles and even traverse chevron markings in order to chase up with him. The TP officers had to be fully alert and take evasive action to avoid a collision with the other vehicles on the expressways. This also created a dangerous situation. An accident could result during the high-speed pursuit. What made it aggravating was that the very persons the accused was trying to escape from are police officers on duty.

94     Hence, I disagreed with the Defence that potential harm here should be low because the accused did not drive through residential or school zones or that there were no risks presented to pedestrians because the incident happened on the expressways. On the contrary, vehicles travelling on the expressways are expected to travel at a higher speed due to the higher speed limits allowed. Even if one does not expect pedestrians to be on the expressways, should a collision happen between vehicles, this can cause greater potential harm to other motorists due to the relative speed that these vehicles are travelling at.

#### The accused’s culpability

95     In relation to the accused’s culpability, I disagreed with the Defence that it was low and agreed with the Prosecution that it was high. In coming to my conclusion, I have considered the manner, circumstances and reasons for the accused’s dangerous driving behaviour.

96     In terms of the manner of driving, the unequivocal evidence from the video footage spoke volumes.

97     Defence had sought to downplay the fact that the accused was speeding at a high speed at the material time by relying on _Winnie Cheah_ in a bid to urge this court not to treat it as an aggravating factor. Regrettably, there are cases from the High Court which have clearly enunciated that speeding is, in itself, an aggravating factor and this will increase the culpability of an accused since this will make his manner of dangerous driving “particularly dangerous”.

98     In _Koh Thiam Huat_, See J held at \[41\]:

> The factors increasing the accused’s _culpability_ would include a particularly dangerous manner of driving. As illustrations, the aggravating factors identified in _Hue An Li_, _i.e_. speeding, drink-driving and sleepy driving, would clearly contribute to this, as would driving while using a mobile phone. In addition, if the dangerous driving was deliberate (for instance, in “hell riding” cases), this would also indicate a higher level of culpability.

99     In _Aw Tai Hock_, Steven Chong JA held at \[38\]:

> Examples of situations where the culpability of the offender would be increased include speeding, drink-driving, sleepy driving (identified as aggravating factors in _PP v Hue An Li_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 661</span> in the context of fatal traffic cases under s 304A(b) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Penal Code”) at \[82\]–\[92\]), driving while using a mobile phone (identified in _Koh Thiam Huat_ (\[18(a)\] supra) at \[41\]), flouting traffic rules, driving against the flow of traffic or off the road (identified in _Stansilas_ (\[30\] supra) at \[56\]), involvement in a car chase, or exhibiting poor control of his vehicle (_Edwin s/o Suse Nathen v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 4 SLR 1139</span> (“_Edwin Suse_”) at \[27\]). These circumstances in relation to the offender’s manner of driving are aggravating due to the increased danger to road users posed by such conduct.

100    I must add that the accused was not only speeding but he was speeding at a speed of at least or almost double the legal speed limit allowed on the expressways. He was hence, not merely just speeding.

101    As for the circumstances of driving, I would not belabour the point that the substantial distance of about 17km in which the accused was speeding and weaving in and out of lanes across the expressways would, without doubt, have heightened the danger posed to other road users. There was a sustained period of dangerous driving. Moreover, it was a working day in the afternoon and the volume of traffic along the expressways was certainly not light. The roads were rather busy.

102    Finally, as for the reasons for driving dangerously, this was again undoubtedly intentional and deliberate on the part of the accused. This was despite Defence counsel’s repeated attempts at suggesting that his client had done so out of sheer fear and panic as well as him being hard of hearing for high frequency sounds even though his hearing was normal for sounds of other frequencies.

103    The accused’s act was intentional and deliberate because he had knowingly and wilfully increased his speed of travel significantly and sped in a bid to escape from the police. The act of accelerating must have been a calculated act. The TP officers were not only in a marked patrol car, they had switched on the blinker lights of the patrol car, horned at the accused and made hand signals for the accused to stop by the side of the road. They even made eye contact with the accused.

104    The accused unquestionably knew that they were police officers. It was at this moment that he decided to increase his speed of travel instead of stopping. The siren of the patrol car was only switched on when the TP officers had to give chase to warn the other motorists on the road. In the circumstances, his excuse that he might not have heard the police siren due to his hard of hearing for high frequency sounds was in my view rather flimsy. It was indeed not a sound decision on his part for wanting to escape from the police.

105    Furthermore, I found it difficult to believe and comprehend that the accused, being a retired military uniformed officer, would want to intentionally and deliberately escape from the TP police officers out of sheer fear and panic. This was more so if he did not feel that he had done anything wrong.

106    In _Chia Hyong Gyee_, it was held by the High Court a conduct that was obviously deliberate, intentional and persistent would make an accused’s conduct particularly culpable (at \[5\] of the oral grounds). Additionally, See J held:

> \[6\] … The respondent’s manner of driving was exceedingly dangerous having regard to the traffic conditions along the PIE at the time. He was a danger not only to himself but to others. He had posed serious risks to numerous other road users including the complainant. His egregious conduct significantly increases his culpability for the offence.

> …

> \[8\]    Having regard to all the circumstances, although there was no actual damage or injury caused, the potential for serious harm was certainly high. The consideration that tips the scales in my view is the fact that the respondent had _chosen_ to drive dangerously, actuated by malice and fully conscious of the high risks involved and the danger posed to other road users. This was an appalling manifestation of “road rage” that went beyond rashness or recklessness. His culpability was demonstrably high. A fine would not suffice to signal the need for effective deterrence of such conduct on the roads.

107    Although the present case was not a “road rage” situation, I agreed with the Prosecution that evading a police arrest is at the very least equally culpable as both require a deliberate act on the part of an accused to drive dangerously. As held previously in both _Koh Thiam Huat_ (at \[41\]) and _Aw Tai Hock_ (at \[40\]), such an intentional act would certainly increase the culpability of an accused as it was a conscious decision on his part create a dangerous situation to other road users. In the circumstances, I would agree with the Prosecution that a fine would not be a sufficient sentence to be imposed on the accused in the present case for effective deterrence of such deplorable conduct on the roads.

108    In addition, in the cases cited the Defence where fines were meted out on the accused (e.g. _Winnie Cheah_, _Chung Tuck Kwai_ and _Lim Hong Eng_), they mostly involved a situation where there was no unequivocal act to deliberately or intentionally drive in a deliberate manner even if the accused might have committed a traffic transgression. The exception was an old case of _PP v Soh Wai Min_ (unreported – MA 66/2000/01) where the accused was imposed the maximum fine of $3,000 (at that time) and a disqualification order of 5 years for driving dangerously in an attempt to evade arrest. Quite apart from the brief details available before the court, that case can be distinguished particularly since the accused there had at the same time been sentenced to nine month’s imprisonment for a s332 PC charge.

109    On the contrary, in the case of _Johnny_ cited by both the Prosecution and Defence where there was evidence of deliberate and intentional act of dangerous driving, the accused there was sentenced to a custodial term of 2 weeks and 30 months DQAC. In fact, Prosecution relied heavily on the case of _Johnny_ in support of its sentencing submission for the accused in the present case.

110    Having decided that the custodial threshold had been crossed given the great potential harm that could have been crossed and the high culpability on the part of the accused, I then determined the appropriate sentence to be meted out on the accused.

#### The appropriate sentence to be imposed

#### The accused’s remorse & driving record

111    In my consideration of the matter holistically, I have taken into account the accused’s early plea of guilt. I further accepted that he had a relatively clean driving record other than his two relevant compounded traffic offences, which included beating the red light signal on 9 February 2007.

#### The accused’s medical condition

112    It is pertinent to highlight that prior to the incident, the accused was already diagnosed with chronic dyspnoea, wheeze and cough for many years due to his heavy smoking. He was first diagnosed with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) as far back as 4 July 2015 when he was admitted to CGH with left lower zone pneumonia and infective exacerbation of CPOD. He was next admitted in July 2015 to CGH again for infective exacerbation of COP with pneumonia.

113    On 22 November 2017, Dr Chew Hock Chin, a respiratory physician at the Gleneagles Medical Centre also confirmed in his diagnosis that the accused was suffering from COPD. In fact, the accused had very severe obstructive ventilator defect. Sometime in November 2017, a lung transplant surgery was even recommended by his regular treating physician from CGH, A/Prof Jagadesan Raghuram. However, the accused did not or was reluctant to proceed with it. As a result of COPD, he was already on regular follow-ups at CGH and advised that he requires long-term inhaler therapy and oxygen therapy daily. Prior to the incident on 5 September 2018, his last admission into CGH for infective exacerbation of COPD was on 24 December 2017.

114    Despite that, he was physically able to ride his Harley in the matter that he did on 5 September 2018.

115    After the incident, from 12 February 2019 to 14 February 2019, the accused was admitted to CGH for pneumonia and this was once again linked to his advanced COPD.

116    On 30 May 2019, the accused was newly diagnosed with early stage prostate cancer by Dr Darren Goh of CGH and has been advised with follow-up treatment.

117    In coming to my decision on sentence, I too have taken into consideration the accused’s present medical condition as a mitigating factor by applying the proportionality principle between an offender’s ill health and the impact of the duration of imprisonment term on him as enunciated in _Chew_.

118    I agreed with the Prosecution that this was not a case of exceptional circumstances where the court should exercise judicial mercy such that the court was compelled by humanitarian considerations to order the minimum imprisonment term or non-custodial sentence. Moreover, as rightfully pointed out by the Defence, despite the fact that the accused in _Chew_ similarly had the medical condition of COPD (in fact the accused there had more serious and more physical ailments), the High Court was of the view that this was insufficient to warrant invoking the doctrine of judicial mercy.

119    Although Prosecution indicated that its position of 2 weeks’ imprisonment had already taken into account the accused’s medical condition, I would only agree to the extent that this may be a starting point for similar cases of such nature.

120    Moreover, the accused in _Johnny_ had a poorer driving record than the present accused. In _Johnny_, the accused was convicted for a similar but dated dangerous driving offence in 1993 and sentenced to a fine of $500. He had 9 other compounded traffic offences including 1 for careless driving, 1 for inconsiderate driving and 7 for speeding. Our present accused had only 2 compounded traffic offences. Besides, the accused in _Johnny_ did not have any apparent medical condition like those suffered by the present accused.

121    All things considered, having taken into account all the various factors, both offence specific and offender specific in nature, I was of the view that the starting position of 2 weeks’ imprisonment should be calibrated downwards. It should be highlighted that the sentence imposed in _Chia Hyong Gyee_ was 1 week’s imprisonment and he had a clean driving record.

122    In the circumstances, I imposed a custodial sentence of 5 days’ imprisonment on the accused. This sentence would have taken into account the discount that was applied in view of the accused’s ill health such that this would fall within the lower end of the established range. Yet, it was not so low as to be manifestly inadequate.

#### Disqualification Period

123    I now come to the disqualification period. Generally, I took no issue with the disqualification period of at least 30 months submitted by the Prosecution, having examined the precedent cases before me as well as evaluating the relevant factors as I had mentioned earlier above.

124    Given that I had calibrated the duration of the custodial sentenced imposed on the accused downwards having due regard to his medical condition, I was of the view that an imposition of a slightly longer disqualification period on the accused would be better served, both as a general and specific form of deterrence. A sentencing discount on the disqualification period should not be applicable as the impact of the prison environment does not come into play. This is particularly given the strong policy reasons against dangerous driving.

125    Furthermore, as gleaned from the cases where there is evidence of deliberate and intentional act of dangerous driving, the disqualification period is generally longer at between 2 to 3 years. There is a greater need to discourage such reckless behaviour.

126    For the foregoing reasons, I was of the view that a disqualification period of 36 months is fair. This was more so when the accused was intentionally evading arrest from the police.

#### Community-based sentence - appropriate in the circumstances?

127    As to the issue of whether a community-based sentence in the form of a short detention order (SDO) should be imposed on the accused was a bone of contention between the Prosecution and Defence, I would discuss this further.

128    A short detention order or SDO is defined in the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) (Cap 68) as follows:

> **Short detention order**

> **348.— (1**)    Where an offender who is 16 years of age or above is convicted of an offence, and if the court by or before which he is convicted is satisfied that having regard to the circumstances, including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender, it is expedient to do so, the court may make a short detention order requiring him to be detained in prison for a period which shall not exceed 14 days.

> (2)    Sections 317 and 318 shall apply to a short detention order as if the order were a sentence of imprisonment passed by the court.

129    The key point to note is that whilst a SDO is a community-based sentence, the offender is still required to be detained in prison for a period which does not exceed 14 days. A SDO therefore carries with it a deterrent element. As held by the High Court in _Sim Wen Yi Earnest_ at \[41\]:

> …It is also in line with the broad policy objective that undergirds the CBS framework, that is, to enable offenders of less serious crimes to be dealt with in ways other than by imposing fines or imprisonment to enhance their chances of rehabilitation without diluting the deterrent objective of our penal regime or jeopardising the public’s sense of safety (_Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts Volume 1_ (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2013) (“_Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts”_) at p77).

130    See JC (as he then was) further mentioned _obiter dicta_ at \[44\] that the principle of “clanging of prison doors” may have a more limited scope of application for SDOs since effectively the offender will still have to undergo a term of imprisonment for not more than 14 days. The SDOs acts as a warning for the offender of a more severe experience of imprisonment if he were to reoffend.

131    Thus, the main rationale of a SDO is really for the purpose of rehabilitation and not to obviate prison term. Given the age and profile of the accused, I would have to agree with the Prosecution that imposing a SDO would not be an appropriate sentence here given the lack of rehabilitative value. More importantly, the custodial sentence of 5 days which I have imposed on the accused was certainly within the 14-day duration of a SDO. Following from there, even if a 5-day SDO is imposed, the accused will still have to be detained in prison for that duration. The accused’s purpose of seeking a SDO is therefore neither here nor there.

132    Last but not least, imposing the SDO for a dangerous driving offence in this particular case would certainly dilute the “deterrent objective of our penal regime or jeopardise the public’s sense of safety”. The accused, being a motorist on the road, had exhibited egregious driving behaviour and could have caused serious potential harm to other road users as well as our enforcement officers.

133    In the light of recent announcements made by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) that amendments will be made to the RTA to enhance penalties for both the dangerous and careless driving offences to not only deter irresponsible driving but to keep irresponsible drivers off the roads for a longer period (_First Reading of the Road Traffic \[Amendment\] Bill)_, The Home Team, 6 May 2019_; Parliament: Recalcitrant drink-drivers to face lifetime driving ban under stiff penalties proposed to Road Traffic Act_, Straits Times, 6 May 2019 and _Parliament: Motorists to face stiffer penalties for dangerous and careless driving_, Straits Times, 8 July 2019_)_\*, this serves as a timely reminder that motorists ought to not only exercise greater care and responsibility on the roads but that offenders who commit serious traffic offences should not expect to be let off readily with a community-based sentence.

(\*NB: The Bill to the amended Road Traffic Act has been passed in Parliament on 8 July 2019).

134    All things considered, I duly imposed a sentence of 5 days’ imprisonment and 36 months’ disqualification period from holding or obtaining driving licences for all classes with effect from the date of conviction. Fundamentally, the sentence, in my view, could not be said to be manifestly excessive given the circumstances.

## CONCLUSION

135    To summarise, as aforementioned, the accused was sentenced accordingly:

136    The accused is currently on bail pending appeal and serving out the disqualification order.
