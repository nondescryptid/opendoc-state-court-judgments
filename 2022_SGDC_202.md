### District Judge Christopher Goh Eng Chiang:

## Introduction

1       This is an appeal filed by the accused, Rosli Bin Ismail, who was dissatisfied with the sentence that I had imposed on him, namely, an imprisonment term of three years’ and four months’ and a fine of $4,500, in default 15 days imprisonment.

## Background

2       The accused faced a total of fourteen charges. However, only the enhanced drug consumption charge was scheduled for one day trial before me on 15 August 2022. The other charges were stood down.

3       On 15 August 2022, the accused informed the court that he wished to plead guilty to the charge. The Prosecution then informed the court that, should the accused decide plead guilty, the plead guilty offer would be revived by the Prosecution. The Prosecution would proceed on five of the charges, take into consideration (“TIC”) eight charges for the purposes of sentencing, and to withdraw one charge.

4       The accused understood this, including the mandatory minimum sentences prescribed by law for the enhanced drug consumption and enhanced drug possession charges and maintained his plea of guilty.

## The charges

5       The accused faced 14 charges. The five proceeded charges included two charges for offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, Rev Ed 2008) (“MDA”), one charge for an offence under s 380 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008) (“PC”), one charge for an offence under s 6(1)(a) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A, Rev Ed 2015) and one charge for an offence under r 4(2) of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020 (“COVID Regulations”). They are briefly set out below:

## Statement of Facts

7       The accused admitted to the statement of facts without qualification.

### The theft charge (DAC-912651-2021)

8       On 13 April 2020, at about 1420 hours, at the Guardian Pharmacy located at Blk 190 Lorong 6 Toa Payoh Central, #01-578, the accused placed five boxes on Panadol valued at $39.90 inside the opening of the umbrella that he was carrying. He then proceeded to walk away from the location and did not intend to pay for the items. However, the accused was detained by the staff of the store who had been observing his conduct. The stolen items were recovered.

9       By virtue of this, the accused had therefore committed an offence under s 380 of the PC.

### The drug charges (DAC-912616-2021 & DAC-912651)

10     On 11 February 2021, at about 0425 hours, police officers arrested the accused at the void deck of Blk 298 Tampines Street 22 on suspicion of committing drug-related offences. One packet and four leaf rolls of fragmented vegetable matter were recovered from the accused’s pants pocket. Following his arrest, the accused provided two bottles of his urine specimen.

11     The accused’s urine samples, and the fragmented vegetable matter found on him were sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis. HSA subsequently issued two certificates under s 16 of the MDA in respect of the urine samples, and a further two certificates under s 16 of the MDA in respect of the fragmented vegetable matter.

12     Both of the accused’s urine samples were found to contain “_2-\[1-(Pent-4-en-1-yl)-1H-indazole-3-carboxamido\]-3,3-dimethylbutanoic acid or its hexanoic acid isomer or any of their respective pentyl positional isomers in their pentyl group_” (“the Substance”). The Substance is a Controlled Drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA and the accused was not authorised to consume the Substance under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder.

13     As the accused had, before he commission of this offences, on 15 March 2015, pursuant to an order made by the Director of the Central Narcotics Bureau, been admitted to an approved institution, namely a Drug Rehabilitation Centre (“DRC”) for the consumption of _methamphetamine_, which is a previous conviction by virtue of s 33A(5)(c)(i) of the MDA, he was thereby liable to be punished under s 33(4AA) of the MDA, with the mandatory minimum sentence being three years’ imprisonment.

14     The one packed and four leaf rolls found on the accused contained not less than 5.93 g and 0.04 g of fragmented vegetable matter respectively. The fragmented vegetable matter were analysed and found to contain _MDMB-4en-PINACA_, a Class A controlled drug listed in First Schedule to the MDA and the accused was not authorised to possess _MDMB-4en-PINACA_ under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder.

15     On 17 June 1995, before the commission of this offence, the accused had been convicted for an offence of possession of a controlled drug under s 8(a) of the MDA and had been sentence to two years’ imprisonment, which conviction and sentence had not been set aside. The accused was therefore liable for enhanced punishment under s 33(1) of the MDA, with the mandatory minimum sentence being two years’ imprisonment.

### The POHA and COVID charge (MAC-905847-2021 & MAC-905848-2021)

16     On 29 April 2020, at about 0930 hours, the accused was seen at the void deck of Blk 202 Tampines Street 21 using his handphone by an estate manager of the Housing & Development Board who had been appointed as an Enforcement Officer (“EO”), for the purpose of enforcing compliance with the COVID Regs, and her colleagues. The EO was therefore a public servant.

17     The EO approached the accused and advised him to leave the area or risked getting fined. However, the accused ignored the EO, remained in the area and continued using his handphone for at least two more minutes. He was again advised to leave the area.

18     The accused told the EO and her colleagues to shut up and that he was not scared of being fined. He told the EO that he had beaten up other persons before, and threatened that he would “_hammer (her) as well_” if she continued bothering him. He then left the area.

19     In threatening the EO in the execution of her duty, the accused had committed an offence punishable under s 6(3) of the POHA. In addition, as he had left his ordinary place of residence without a reasonable excuse, the accused had committed an offence punishable under s 34(7) of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020.

23     The Prosecution explained briefly why they were seeking the above sentences:

> (a)     The MDA charges. These were the mandatory minimum imprisonment terms that have been prescribed by law;

> (b)     The shoplifting charge. It was submitted that the primary sentencing consideration was specific deterrence. Taking into account that the accused was heavily traced for property related antecedents, the value of the items stolen (and their recovery), other TIC charges for theft offences, four months’ imprisonment was appropriate;

> (c)     The COVID charge. The Prosecution submitted for a fine of $1,500, which was higher than the usual tariff as the accused also had similar TIC COVID charges;

> (d)     The POHA charge. It was submitted that the custody threshold was not crossed, and the Prosecution left the quantum of fine to the court.

### The Accused’s plea in mitigation

24     There was nothing remarkable about the accused’s plea in mitigation. He asked the court for leniency. He sought for a light sentence and was sorry for committing the offences. He also hoped that his sentence would be backdated.

## Decision on sentence

### The enhanced drug consumption charge

25     This is the accused’s first conviction for the consumption of drugs. However, as the accused was previously sent to DRC in 2015, he was therefore liable for enhanced punishment of three years’ imprisonment. There were no aggravating factors that would warrant an uplift to the mandatory minimum sentence.

26     As the accused had pleaded guilty before trial, I was of the view that the appropriate sentence in the present case was the mandatory minimum sentence of _three years’ imprisonment_.

### The enhanced drug possession charge

27     Although the Prosecution submitted for the mandatory imprisonment term of two years for the enhanced possession charge, this was actually the accused’s fourth conviction for drug possession. He had previously been sentenced to two years’ imprisonment on two occasions, in 1994 and in 1995.

28     However, as the Prosecution did not seek a higher sentence and the fact that the accused’s last conviction for drug possession was 27 years ago, I agreed with the Prosecution that the appropriate sentence for the enhanced possession charge was the mandatory minimum sentence of _two years’ imprisonment_.

### The theft charge

29     The value of the items stolen by the accused was of low value and the stolen items were recovered. Therefore, if the accused had been a first offender, a short custodial sentence would have sufficed. However, the accused had numerous property related convictions. In fact, he had previously been sentenced to six years’ Corrective Training for attempted theft in dwelling in 2007 and his last conviction for theft was in 2018 when he was sentenced to a total sentence of eight months’ and two weeks’ imprisonment.

30     Hence, the suggested sentence of four months’ imprisonment for the theft of the five boxes on Panadol valued at $39.90 was appropriate in the circumstances. I accordingly sentenced the accused to _four months’ imprisonment_ for the theft charge.

### The COVID charge

31     I agreed with the Prosecution’s assessment that this breach was one with low culpability and low harm. Therefore, the custody threshold had not been crossed. The indicative sentence range would accordingly be a fine in the range of $1,000 to $3,000. As the accused also had similar COVID TIC charges, a fine on the lower end of this range was not appropriate. Hence, I agreed with the Prosecution that the appropriate _fine was $1,500_.

### The POHA charge

32     In the POHA charge, the accused had used threatening words towards the victim in relation to her execution of her duty as a public servant. He had threatened to “_hammer (her) as well_” if she continued bothering him. Although this would be more serious than simply using abusive language towards a public servant, this appeared to be a one-off threat and I agreed with the Prosecution that the custody threshold for this offence was not crossed.

33     The sentencing tariff in such non-aggravated cases is usually a fine in the range of between $2,000 to $4,000. As what was uttered was a threat, I was of the view that a sentence on the lower end of this range was not warranted. In addition, there was another POHA charge that was TIC. This was for using abusive words against another EO on a different occasion.

34     Accordingly, I was of the view that the appropriate sentence in this instant was _a fine of $3,000_.

### Consecutive sentences

35     Under s 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, Rev Ed 2012) (“CPC”), where the court sentences an offender to a term of imprisonment for three distinct offences, the court must order that the sentences for at least two offences must run consecutively.

36     Following the principles laid out by the High Court in _Muhammad Shouffee bin Adam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span>, I agreed with the Prosecution that the terms of imprisonment imposed for the enhanced drug consumption charge and the theft charge should run consecutively.

## Final sentence imposed

37     Therefore, the final sentence imposed on the accused is as follows:

38     In addition, I ordered that this sentence of imprisonment was to commence with effect from 2 March 2021, the date on which his personal bond had been revoked, and court bail offered. He has been unable to raise the bail amount since that date. Therefore the today sentence imposed on the accused was:

_Imprisonment term of 3 years and 4 months and_

_a Fine of $4,500 in default 15 days’ imprisonment_

39     In my view, the sentence imposed on the accused was fair and appropriate. There was nothing in the accused’s plea in mitigation that warranted any downward adjustment to the final sentence.

40     For reasons unknown, the accused is dissatisfied with the sentence I have imposed, now appeals against it. He is presently serving sentence.

### Postscript: the withdrawn charge (DAC-902706-2021)

41     As part of the plead guilty offer, the Prosecution indicated that it would be withdrawing _DAC-902706-2021_, a theft in dwelling charge, under s 147(1) of the CPC. This provided that:

> “Where 2 or more charges are made against the same person and the person has been convicted on one or more of them, the prosecution may, with the consent of the court, withdraw the remaining charge or any of the remaining charges”

42     I accordingly consented to this and granted the accused a discharge amounting to an acquittal under s 147(1) of the CPC in relation to _DAC-902706-2021._

43     I should highlight that the accused was particularly aggrieved by this charge. He felt that he had been wrongly charged for this offence. He informed the court that he intended to seek compensation from the Prosecution. I proceeded to explain to the accused that it would be open to him to seek compensation from the Prosecution under s 359(3) of the CPC, if he proves to the satisfaction of the court that the prosecution was frivolous or vexatious. I also informed the accused that he could make such an application after the case was concluded, through the Integrated Case Management System (“ICMS”), or, by way of a written application ‘should he be unable to file his application in ICMS. I would thereafter proceed to give the necessary directions.

44     To date, the accused has not filed any application.
