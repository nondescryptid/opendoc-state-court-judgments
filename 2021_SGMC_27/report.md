2       On the 6th day of trial, pursuant to an offer by the Prosecution, the Accused had decided to plead guilty to 2 charges, namely MAC 908739-2019 and MAC 908740-2019 with the remaining 3 charges to be taken into consideration for purposes of sentencing. I took the Accused’s plea on 22 March 2021 and adjourned the matter to 6 April 2021 to enable the Defence Counsel to prepare his mitigation plea and for sentencing.

3       On 6 April 2021, the Prosecution, in addition to the sentence to be imposed on the 2 proceeded charges, had also sought an order under section 23A of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act to recover from the Accused his proceeds of crime. After hearing the Prosecution’s sentencing position and the Accused’s mitigation, I imposed the following sentence on the Accused:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="10.3220644128826%"> <col width="30.7661532306461%"> <col width="58.9117823564713%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">S/No</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Charge No.</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Sentence</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">MAC 908739-2019</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fine of $12,000 default 3 weeks’ imprisonment and penalty of $1,500 in default 3 days’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">MAC 908740-2019</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fine of $12,000 in default 3 weeks’ imprisonment and penalty of $2,000 in default 4 days imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Total:</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fine of $24,000 in default 6 weeks’ imprisonment and penalty of $3,500 in default 7 day’s imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

4       The Accused had also requested for time to pay the fines and penalties and I granted him time till 30 April 2021 for him to pay the $27,500.

5       The Accused being dissatisfied with my decision, had filed his Notice of Appeal against my sentence on 16 April 2021. I hereby set out my reasons for my sentence.

## Statement of Facts

6       The Accused had admitted to the following Statement of Facts without qualification:

7       During the material period of time, the Accused was employed by Prime Force Engineering Pte Ltd (the “Company”) as an excavator machine operator.

8       On 2 January 2019, Chung Pak Nan, an Employment Inspector with the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”), carried out investigations upon receiving information of possible contravention of the laws relating to the employment of foreign employees.

### Facts relating to MAC-908740-2019

9       Bhowmik Nayan Chandra (“Nayan”) was the foreign employee who had paid a sum of money indirectly to the Accused for his (Nayan’s) employment with the Company.

10     Hossain Md Parvez (“Parvez”) was the mutual friend of Nayan and the Accused.

11     Investigations revealed that on one of the Sundays in July 2018, the Accused had met up with his friends, including Parvez, along Serangoon Road. During that meeting, Parvez had asked the Accused if there was any job vacancy for Nayan in the Company. At that time, Nayan was still in Bangladesh.

12     The Accused informed Parvez that Nayan would be able to get a job in the Company if he was willing to pay a sum of $4,000. When this was conveyed to Nayan, Nayan agreed to pay the $4,000 to secure an employment with the Company. To this end, Nayan sent a copy of his passport to the Accused through Parvez. Following this, the Company made a work pass application for Nayan.

13     After that, on or about 31 August 2018, through Parvez, the Accused sent Nayan his In-Principle Approval (“IPA”) form to work for the Company as a welder & flame cutter. After receiving the IPA, on or about 2 September 2018, Nayan remitted $4,000 to Parvez for the purpose of his employment with the Company. On or about 2 September 2018, Parvez handed over $2,000 to another mutual friend Md Hridoy (“Hridoy”) to be passed to the Accused. Following this Hridoy met the Accused at the vicinity of Serangoon Road and passed the sum of $2,000 to the Accused.

14     Following the above, Nayan arrived in Singapore on 15 September 2018 with the IPA issued under the Company. He started working as a welder for the Company on 17 September 2018. His last day of employment with the Company was on 9 January 2019.

15     No restitution was made to Nayan.

16     By receiving a sum of $2,000 indirectly from Nayan as a condition for Nayan’s employment with the Company, the Accused had committed an offence under section 22A(1)(a) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Cap 91A) which was punishable under section 22A(2) of the same Act.

### Facts relating to MAC-908739-2019

17     Halder Pramanondo (“Pramanondo”) was the foreign employee who had paid a sum of money indirectly to the Accused for his (Pramanondo’s) employment with the Company.

18     Investigations revealed that sometime in April 2018, Pramanondo got to know the Accused when they were staying at the same dormitory. At around May 2018, Pramanondo’s work permit with his then employer was expiring and he was preparing to go back to Bangladesh. Before leaving for Bangladesh, Pramanondo requested the Accused to inform him of any employment opportunity in Singapore. Following this, sometime in June 2018, the Accused contacted Pramanondo, who was already in Bangladesh, to inform him of a job vacancy in the Company with a daily wage of $25. The Accused also informed Pramonondo that he would have to pay a sum of $4,000 if he wanted to be employed by the Company. Pramonondo agreed to pay the $4,000 and he sent the Accused a copy of his passport.

19     Following the above, the Company made a work pass application for Pramanondo. After that, on or about 25 August 2018, the Accused sent Pramanondo a copy of his IPA form to work for the Company as a welder & flame cutter. The Accused also informed Pramonondo that he would purchase an air-ticket for Pramanondo after receiving the full payment of $4,000. On or about 15 September 2018, Pramonondo instructed his cousin, one Haldar Sonjoy Kumar (“Sonjoy”), to pay $1,500 to the Accused for his (Pramonondo’s) employment with the Company. Sonjoy met the Accused at Blue Stars Dormitory located at 3 Kian Teck Lane, Singapore 627844 and handed over $1,500 in cash to the Accused.

20     On 5 October 2018, the Accused sent Pramanondo his air ticket and Pramanondo arrived in Singapore on 6 October 2018 using the IPA. He was then employed by the Company as a welder from 8 October 2018 to 10 January 2019.

21     No restitution was made to Pramanondo.

22     By receiving a sum of $1,500 indirectly from Pramanondo as a condition for Pramanondo’s employment with the Company, the Accused had committed an offence under section 22A(1)(a) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Cap 91A, Rev Ed.2009) which was punishable under section 22A(2) of the same Act.

23     The Accused was charged accordingly.

## Sentencing

### Punishment prescribed by law

24     The punishment prescribed under section 22A(2) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Cap 91) was a fine not exceeding $30,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both.

### Antecedents

25     The Accused was untraced with any criminal antecedents.

### Prosecution’s position on sentence[^1]

26     The Prosecution had submitted for a fine of $12,000 per proceeded charge. In addition, the Prosecution had asked for disgorgement of the monies which the Accused had taken from the victims under section 23A of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Cap 91).

27     The Prosecution had also submitted a table of sentencing precedents for my consideration and they pointed out to me that the usual fine imposed by the court in a case where an accused had pleaded guilty was around $12,000:

### Mitigation and Defence’s submission on sentence

#### Mitigating factors

28     The Defence had urged me to consider the following mitigating factors:

> (a)     The Accused had been in Singapore for more than 5 years. Because of the present case, the Accused had been unable to work in Singapore and he was relying on financial support from his family in Bangladesh for his expenses in Singapore;

> (b)     The Accused was a first offender and he was untraced;

29     In view of the above, the Defence urged me to impose the minimum sentence on the Accused.

### My decision on sentence

#### Sentencing considerations for the Section 22A

30     Section 22A of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act was enacted by Parliament by way of Act No. 24 of 2012 and it came into force on 9 November 2012.

31     The Acting Minister of Manpower, Mr Tan Chuan-Jin had set out the rationale for the enactment of section 22A of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act during the Second Reading of the Employment of Foreign Manpower (Amendment) Bill:

>      _“Employers in Singapore are by and large responsible, but there are some who seek to profit by circumventing our work pass framework. As we further tighten the policies on the hiring and retention of foreign manpower, we can expect errant employers to try harder to get round the rules. … For example, we found some declaring higher salaries than they were actually paying their foreign workers, asking foreign workers to foot their own levies_  _and insurance premiums, contributing CPF to locals that do not really exist …_

>      _Singaporeans ultimately suffer when employers fail to pay the true costs of hiring foreign manpower or hiring foreign manpower that they are not entitled to. Local workers will lose out in employment opportunities. Honest employers who play by the rules are also unfairly disadvantaged. Besides errant employers, syndicates also profit from setting up sham operations to illegally import and supply foreign workers who otherwise should not be here. …_

>      _Sir, the proposed amendments to the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act will enhance the Government’s ability to ensure the integrity of our work pass framework. Recognising that EFMA contraventions range widely from administrative infringements to criminal offences, these amendments will introduce a calibrated and appropriate response to different types of contraventions. In totality, the changes will allow my Ministry to step up enforcement actions against errant employers, errant foreign workers and syndicates more expeditiously and effectively, thereby enhancing deterrence against EFMA contraventions, which ultimately hurts Singaporeans…_

>      _…_

>      _Third_, **_we will prosecute persons, including employers, supervisors, HR staff and sub-contractors, that collect monies as consideration for employment from foreign workers … The collection of employment kickbacks increases the foreign workers debt burden while disadvantaging Singaporeans in favour of foreign labour._**

>      _…_

>      **_To further enhance deterrence, we will increase maximum penalties for EFMA contraventions. The penalties have been benchmarked against contraventions of similar nature in the Immigration Act and the Penal Code_** _.”_

**\[Emphasis mine\]**

32     Based on the legislative object behind the enactment of section 22A of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act, it was clear to me that section 22A was meant to protect the foreign workers as well as not to disadvantage Singaporeans in favour of foreign labour. As such, the primary sentencing consideration for a section 22A charge must be general deterrence.

#### Aggravating factors on the part of the Accused

33     I noted the following aggravating factors on the part of the Accused:

> (a)      The number of charges involved

>> (i)       In the present case, the total amount involved in all the 5 charges including the 3 charges which were taken into consideration was $8,000.00.

>> (ii)       The Accused had not made any restitution to date.

>> (iii)       The fact that there was a very large amount of money taken by the Accused of which no restitution was made was an aggravating factor.

> (b)      The number of victims and period of the Accused’s offending behaviour

>> (i)       In the present case, the Accused had obtained money from 2 victims, namely Nayan and Pramanondo to help them secure jobs in the Company.

>> (ii)       The Accused had received a total of $4,000 from Nayan on 2 separate occasions on 2 September 2018 and 7 September 2018 and he had received a total of $4,000 from Pramanondo on 3 separate occasions on 15 September 2018, 19 September 2018 and 29 September 2018.

>> (iii)       It could be seen from above that the money that the Accused had obtained from the victims was not one-off but over a number of occasions and over a one-month period.

> (c)      The Accused had committed the offence for his own benefit

>> (i)       It was clear from the Statement of Fact that the money that the Accused had collected from the victims all went to the Accused. There was nothing in the Statement of Fact which had suggested that the Accused had given the money to another person or that he had shared the money with any other person.

> (d)      The amount taken by the Accused constituted a large proportion of the victim’s potential salary in Singapore

>> (i)       It was stated in the Statement of Fact that the Accused had recommended Pramanondo to work as a welder and flame cutter in the Company for a daily wage of $25. Given that the Accused had obtained a total sum of $4,000 from Pramanondo, the $4,000 would be equivalent to 160 days of daily wages for Pramanondo in Singapore. That would have meant that Pramanondo would have to work for 160 days in Singapore without salary and that would clearly have increased Pramanondo’s debt burden.

#### The Accused’s mitigating factors

34     As for the Accused’s mitigating factors, I accepted the Defence’s submission that the Accused was a first offender and he had no criminal antecedents. I also noted that the Accused was currently unemployed and he was getting financial support from his family in Bangladesh.

35     While I accepted that the Accused’s personal and family problems, the Accused’s personal circumstances usually carried little weight as mitigating factors for the purposes of sentencing. The Court of Appeal in _PP v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 69</span> \[at 75\] had pointed out:

>      _“An often-cited factor raised by offenders relates to the difficult personal circumstances that they faced at the time of the offences. This will, rarely, if ever, have mitigating value: see Lai Oei Mui Jenny v PP \[1993\] 2 SLR ( R) 406 at \[10\](in the context of giving false information to a public servant) and PP v Osi Maria Elenora Protacio <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 78</span> at \[8\](in the context of the offence of criminal breach of trust)”._

#### Sentence to be imposed

36     From the sentencing precedents tendered by the Prosecution, I noted that the sentence imposed by the court for a first time offender or an offender without related antecedents who had pleaded guilty for an offence under section 22A(1) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act was usually a fine. The sentencing precedents tendered by the Prosecution also showed that the court had imposed fines of $12,000 where the amount received by an offender was in the range of $1,700 to $4,000.

37     I noted that the Accused had received a sum of $1,500.00 from Pramanondo in MAC 908739-2019 and a sum of $2,000 from Nayan in MAC 908740-2019. No restitution was made by the Accused in respect of the 2 proceeded charges.

38     The Prosecution had also applied for a disgorgement order under section 23A(1)(a) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Cap 91A). Section 23A(1)(a) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act provided that:

>      **_Orders for payment of proceeds of crime_**

> 23A.—(1)     **_When any person is convicted of an offence under section 22A(2) or 22B(1), the court shall, in addition to imposing on that person any other punishment, order him to pay_** _, within such time as may be specified in the order —_

>> (_a_)     **_in the case of an offence under section 22A(2), a sum which is equal to the amount of the sum or other benefit (where such benefit is a sum of money, or the value of such benefit can be assessed) he deducted or received in contravention of that section_** _; or_

>> (_b_)     _in the case of an offence under section 22B(1), a sum which is equal to the amount of the sum or other benefit (where such benefit is a sum of money, or the value of such benefit can be assessed) he obtained or received for obtaining the work pass referred to in that section._

39     In the present case, I also took into account the fact that although the Accused had decided to take a certain cause, he had done so only after 6 days of hearing.

40     In deciding the sentence to be imposed, I had taken into account the following:

> (a)     The large amount of monies involved;

> (b)     The fact that the Accused’s offending behaviour was not a one-off incident but it was a course of conduct committed over a number of occasions over a period of time;

> (c)     The fact that the Accused had committed the offences for his personal gain;

> (d)     The fact that the Accused had decided to take a certain cause only on the 6th day of trial; and

> (e)     The Accused’s mitigating circumstances.

41     Having considered all the submissions by both parties, the precedents tendered by the parties and circumstances of the case, I was of the view that my following sentences were not unreasonable or manifestly excessive:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="10.3220644128826%"> <col width="30.7661532306461%"> <col width="58.9117823564713%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">S/No</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Charge No.</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Sentence</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">MAC 908739-2019</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fine of $12,000 default 3 weeks’ imprisonment and penalty of $1,500 in default 3 days’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">MAC 908740-2019</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fine of $12,000 in default 3 weeks’ imprisonment and penalty of $2,000 in default 4 days imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Total:</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fine of $24,000 in default 6 weeks’ imprisonment and penalty of $3,500 in default 7 day’s imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

42     The Accused being dissatisfied with my decision, had filed his Notice of Appeal against my sentence.
