### District Judge Lau Qiuyu:

1       The accused pleaded guilty to three charges of forgery for the purpose of cheating under s 468 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (the “PC”), and one charge of cheating under s 420 of the PC. She also admitted to and consented for six other charges to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. Of these, five were under s 468 of the PC, and one was under s 420 of the PC.

2       After convicting the accused, I imposed a total sentence of 35 months’ imprisonment as follows:

3       The accused has lodged an appeal against sentence and I set out the reasons for my decision below. A stay of execution on the sentence was allowed further to the lodging of the appeal. The accused is presently on bail pending the appeal.

## Consent of the Public Prosecutor

4       Before proceeding to discuss the facts of the case proper, I first address a preliminary issue relating to the consent of the Public Prosecutor. Under s 10(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (the “CPC”), a prosecution for an offence under Chapter XVIII of the PC must not be instituted except with the consent of the Public Prosecutor. In the present case, there were three proceeded charges under s 468 of the PC, and five charges under s 468 of the PC were taken into consideration. As s 468 of the PC fell within Chapter XVIII of the PC, the consent of the Public Prosecutor was required.

5       The accused’s plea of guilty was taken on 8 November 2021 and she was convicted on the same day. The hearing was then adjourned to 9 December 2021 as the Defence required more time to prepare its mitigation plea.

6       At the start of the hearing on 9 December 2021, I highlighted to parties that the consent of the Public Prosecutor did not appear to have been filed. The Prosecution acknowledged the same and sought a short stand down to file the consent. I granted the stand down and asked that the Defence take instructions in the meantime on how the accused wished to proceed in view of the late filing of the said consent, particularly since the accused had already been convicted.[^1] When court resumed after the stand down, the Prosecution tendered the requisite consent of the Public Prosecutor. The Defence confirmed that it had no issues with the consent that was filed and that, upon taking instructions, the accused would not require the plea to be set aside and wished to proceed with mitigation and sentencing.[^2]

7       To this end, I had regard to s 423(b) of the CPC, which provides as follows:

> **423**.    Subject to this Code, any judgment, sentence or order passed or made by a court of competent jurisdiction may not be reversed or altered on account of —

>> …

>> (b)    the lack of any consent by the Public Prosecutor as required by law;

>> …

>> unless the … lack of consent has caused a failure of justice.

8       In the present case, the Defence did not, prior to the court’s query at the hearing on 9 December 2021, submit that the requisite consent has not been filed. Thereafter, the Defence also did not raise any issues arising from the late filing of the consent of the Public Prosecutor. The accused further confirmed that she would not require for the plea to be set aside and wished for proceedings to continue where they left off. In the premises, it did not appear to me that any failure of justice has been occasioned and I proceeded to hear the Defence’s mitigation.

9       Having dealt with this preliminary issue of the consent of the Public Prosecutor, I now proceed to set out the facts of the case.

## The charges

10     The three charges for forgery for the purpose of cheating are reproduced below:

> DAC-923529-2019

> You… are charged that you, on or about 15 December 2015, in Singapore, did forge a certain document, to wit, an AIA Smart G468 Contract bearing number SP10245890, purportedly issued by AIA Singapore, intending that the said contract be used for the purpose of cheating one Wong Lee Lieng, and thereby dishonestly inducing Wong Lee Lieng to deliver to you SGD 50,000, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 468 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

> DAC-923530-2019

> You… are charged that you, on or about 29 December 2015, in Singapore, did forge a certain document, to wit, an AIA Smart G468 Contract bearing number U094512894, purportedly issued by AIA Singapore, intending that the said contract be used for the purpose of cheating one Wong Lee Lieng, and thereby dishonestly inducing Wong Lee Lieng to deliver to you SGD 50,000, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 468 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

> DAC-923537-2019

> You… are charged that you, on or about 14 October 2013, in Singapore, did forge a certain document, to wit, an HSBC insurance policy namely ‘Asset Manager II, purportedly issued by HSBC Singapore, intending that the said contract be used for the purpose of cheating one Lee Han Tiong, and thereby dishonestly inducing Lee Han Tiong to deliver to you SGD 32,000, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 468 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

11     The cheating charge is reproduced below:

> DAC-923536-2019

> You… are charged that you, on or about 25 September 2014, at Parkway Parade, Singapore, did cheat StarHub Pte Ltd (“StarHub”), _to wit_, by deceiving StarHub into believing that you were one Lim Kim Hoon, who had applied for two mobile service lines (bearing \[xxx\] and \[xxx\]) packaged with 2 Apple iPhone 6s valued at SGD 1,978, a fact which you knew to be false, and by such manner of deception, dishonestly induced StarHub to deliver to you the said iPhone 6s valued at SGD 1,978, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 420 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

## Facts

12     The accused admitted to the statement of facts without qualification. The salient facts have been summarised and reproduced below.

### Facts relating to DAC-923529-2019 and DAC-923530-2019 (s 468 PC)

13     The accused was working as an insurance agent for AIA Singapore (“AIA”) at the material time, and she got to know that Wong Lee Lieng (“the first victim”) was a client of AIA. Sometime around late 2015, the accused met with the first victim and sold her an AIA policy. During that time, the accused was in debt from various loan sharks. The accused then hatched a plan to forge an AIA insurance policy to get more money from the first victim.

14     On or about 15 December 2015, the accused forged a document, namely, an AIA Smart G468 Contract bearing policy number SP10245890, with the AIA letterhead, and presented it to the first victim. The accused represented to the first victim that it was an investment policy with promised returns of $52,340 by December 2016 if the first victim first put in $50,000. In reliance of the document, the first victim agreed and delivered to the accused $50,000 in cash.

15     On or about 29 December 2015, employing the same _modus operandi_, the accused forged a document, namely an AIA Smart G468 Contract bearing policy number U094512894, with the AIA letterhead and presented it to the first victim. The accused told the first victim that the document represented an investment policy with the promised returns of $52,340 if the first victim puts in $50,000 immediately. In reliance of the document, the first victim agreed and delivered $50,000 to the accused.

16     Both policy numbers SP10245890 and U094512894 were not valid AIA policy numbers and were not issued by AIA. The accused admitted that the policy numbers were invalid and that she had come up with them on her own. On or about December 2015, the accused, with the intention that the contract be used for the purpose of cheating the first victim, dishonestly created the documents at \[14\] and \[15\] above, with the intention of causing it to be believed that the document was made by the authority of AIA. The enclosed AIA letterhead and signatures were copied from an existing contract.

17     As there were no returns on her policies as promised, the first victim enquired with the accused on the same. The accused then admitted that she had used all the money for her own expenses and to repay her debts. To date, the accused has made restitution of $21,200 to the first victim.

### Facts relating to DAC-923537-2019 (s 468 PC)

18     The accused was an insurance agent with HSBC Singapore (“HSBC”) at the material time. On 14 October 2013, Lee Han Tiong (“the third victim”) was a grab driver who picked up the accused as a passenger. The accused told the third victim that she was a HSBC staff and that she has an insurance plan under HSBC that promised better rates. The third victim had just sold his house and wanted to invest the money he obtained from the sale.

19     The accused then forged a HSBC insurance policy with the name “Asset Manager II” and presented the policy to the third victim. In reliance of this document, the third victim believed that this was a genuine policy from HSBC and signed the document. The third victim also handed over $32,000 in cash to the accused.

20     The accused admitted that the policy was fake and prepared the document through using copies of existing contracts. On or about October 2013, the accused, with the intention that the contract be used for the purpose of cheating the third victim, dishonestly created the document at \[19\] above using a computer, with the intention of causing it to be believed that the document was made by the authority of HSBC.

21     To date, no restitution has been made to the third victim.

### Facts relating to DAC-923536-2019 (s 420 PC)

22     At the material time, the accused was renting a room from Lim Kim Hoon (“the fourth victim”).

23     As the fourth victim was illiterate, the fourth victim would seek the accused’s assistance on matters such as reading letters or paying bills. The fourth victim would hand over her NRIC along with cash to the accused so that the accused could assist to pay the bills.

24     On or about 25 September 2014, the accused had possession of the fourth victim’s NRIC. The accused went to the StarHub Pte Ltd (“StarHub”) outlet at Parkway Parade to sign up for two mobile service lines, which came packaged with two Apple iPhone 6s amounting to $1,978. The accused presented the NRIC of the fourth victim to the staff, representing that she was one “Lim Kim Hoon”. The staff then photocopied the fourth victim’s NRIC and prepared a contract in the fourth victim’s name, which the accused signed on.

25     The staff, in reliance of the above and the accused’s deception, delivered the two iPhone 6s to the accused, which the staff would not have done so had the truth been known to her.

26     The accused made restitution of $5,000 to the fourth victim, which is the subject of DAC-923535-2019 (a charge taken into consideration for sentencing). No restitution has been made to StarHub.

## Sentencing

### Antecedents

27     The accused is untraced.

### Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

28     The Prosecution submitted for a global sentence of at least 36 to 49 months’ imprisonment.

#### Forgery for the purposes of cheating under s 468 PC

29     The Prosecution submitted that there was no prescribed framework for offences under s 468 of the PC, though it highlighted the High Court’s observations in _Lim Ek Kian v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] SGHC 58</span> (“_Lim Ek Kian_”) at \[35\] that the “courts have always treated offences under s 468 PC seriously, and past cases have adopted a 12 month sentence of imprisonment as a benchmark.”

30     Nonetheless, the Prosecution submitted that the sentencing framework for cheating offences under s 420 of the PC, as set out by the District Court in _Public Prosecutor v Gene Chong Soon Hui_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 117</span> (“_Gene Chong_”), could be a useful guide for offences under s 468 of the PC. The sentencing framework in _Gene Chong_ is set out at \[38\] below. The Prosecution noted that the crux of both offences under s 420 and s 468 were similar. However, the Prosecution was unaware of any cases which had applied or expressly endorsed the sentencing framework in _Gene Chong_ to an offence under s 468 of the PC.[^3]

31     The Prosecution also raised the case of _Public Prosecutor v Kwa Tien Hwa_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 119</span>, which set out a list of factors that the court may take into consideration in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence of forgery _simpliciter_ under s 465 of the PC, namely: (a) the nature and the significance of the forged documents; (b) ultimate objective aimed to be achieved by the forgery; (c) nature and value of the property parted by the victim because of the forged document; (d) multiple charges/multiple victims; (e) premeditated; (f) syndicated; (g) degree of planning and sophistication; (h) affects the financial system or commercial integrity of Singapore; (i) fraud on revenue (taxes) or on excise (import duty); (j) fraud on the authorities; (k) abuse of position of trust; (l) amount involved; (m) malicious intent; and (n) length of time over which the offences were committed.

32     As regards sentencing precedents for offences under s 468 of the PC, the Prosecution relied on the following two reported decisions:

> (a)      _Public Prosecutor v Choy Yut Hong_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 132</span> (“_Choy Yut Hong_”), where 15 months’ imprisonment was imposed for a charge under s 468 of the PC which involved $50,400; and

> (b)      _Public Prosecutor v Tang Wai Kit_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 222</span> (“_Tang Wai Kit_”), where 15 months’ imprisonment was imposed for a charge under s 468 of the PC which caused losses amounting to $26,910.

33     The Prosecution submitted that general deterrence ought to be the primary sentencing consideration because such offences were easy to commit but difficult to detect. The accused had either copied and pasted parts of existing contracts, or compiled pages of existing contracts to form a new contract for the victims to sign. The victims believed that they were entering into valid contracts and delivered the monies to the accused. It would thus have been difficult for a lay person to notice that the policies were forged.

34     Further, the Prosecution raised that, in misusing parts of the insurance contracts which bore the insurer’s letterhead, the accused’s actions have a flow-on effect of affecting the delivery of financial services. The Prosecution quoted the observations of the High Court in _Public Prosecutor v Fernando Payagala Waduge Malitha Kumar_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 334</span> (“_Fernando_”) and submitted that the stiff and uncompromising stance taken by courts in sentencing offenders who commit offences affecting the delivery of financial services was justified.

35     The Prosecution analogised the current case to the observations at \[1\] and \[49\] of _Fernando_ and submitted that the prevalence of such offences to forge insurance documents would have the similar effect of resulting in more onerous checks. Consequently, the added administrative costs for the institution and the industry might ultimately be passed on to the consumers.

36     The following points were also raised by the Prosecution:

> (a)     While the accused was untraced, she has five other charges under s 468 of the PC which were taken into consideration for sentencing.

> (b)     The accused had utilised her position as an insurance agent to obtain the requisite documents and information to facilitate her wrongdoing. There was an abuse of trust, and the level of sophistication could not be said to be low.

> (c)     The offences were difficult to detect and the victims themselves did not suspect that the documents were forged.

> (d)     The sums involved per charge were not _de minimis_ and were for the accused’s financial benefit as she used them for her own expenses and to pay off her loans.

> (e)     The period of offending was 10 months in respect of the first victim (from February 2015 to April 2016), and less than one month for the third victim (from 14 October 2013 to 21 October 2013).

37     Having regard to the above, and relying on the sentencing framework in _Gene Chong_ as a rough guide, the Prosecution submitted that the present case fell within the moderate harm and medium culpability band (_ie_, 18 to 42 months’ imprisonment), and submitted for a sentence of at least 18 to 24 months’ imprisonment each for DAC-923529-2019 and at least 16 to 22 months for DAC-923538-2019.

#### Cheating under s 420 PC

38     The Prosecution relied on the sentencing framework for offences under s 420 of the PC, as set out in _Gene Chong_ at \[26\]:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="20.56%"> <col width="28.04%"> <col width="28.04%"> <col width="23.36%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Section 420</b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Penal Code</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Slight Harm</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Moderate Harm</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Severe Harm</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Low Culpability</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Up to 6 months imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6 months to 1.5 year imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1.5 to 3.5 years imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Medium</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6 months to 1.5 year imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1.5 to 3.5 years imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3.5 to 6.5 years imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>High Culpability</b></p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1.5 to 3.5 years imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3.5 to 6.5 years imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6.5 to 10 years imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

39     The Prosecution placed the current facts as falling within the low culpability and slight harm band, and submitted for a sentence of at least two to three months’ imprisonment, having regard to the following factors:

> (a)     While the quantum may be regarded as low, the benefit was for the accused’s own financial gain.

> (b)     The level of sophistication was low and it was a once-off incident.

> (c)     The accused had abused the trust reposed in her by the fourth victim for her own financial gain.

> (d)     While the accused was untraced, she has another charge under s 420 of the PC, which was taken into consideration for sentencing (DAC-923535-2019). However, the Prosecution has considered that restitution has been made for DAC-923535-2019.

#### Total sentence across the proceeded charges

40     The Prosecution referred to the court’s observations in _Tang Wai Kit_ at \[44\] that “the aggregate sentence was to be emphasised over a ‘granular approach relating to the sentence for \[the\] individual charges’”. In the present case, the total loss across all charges (both proceeded and those taken into consideration) was $330,878, of which $26,200 has been returned. Of these, the loss across proceeded charges was $133,978.

41     The Prosecution’s position was that DAC-923529-2019, DAC-923536-2019 and DAC-923537-2019 ought to run consecutively, resulting in a global sentence of at least 36 to 49 months’ imprisonment. A summary of the Prosecution’s position is set out below:

### Mitigation

42     In mitigation, the Defence raised the following personal circumstances of the accused:

> (a)     The accused faced a challenging childhood and grew up in a physically abusive and hostile environment. As her father had borrowed from loan sharks, she was always fearful and worried about loan sharks coming to her home.

> (b)     After the accused gave birth to her first child in 2009, she had no one to help her, and she was highly irritable and felt stressed.

> (c)     The accused’s husband was a gambler whose gambling habits led to a massive amount of debt. She had to help pay off her husband’s debts by using credit card advances and taking loans from loan sharks. This led to harassment from the loan sharks when she was unable to repay the loans. She was in a constant state of anxiety and had to leave her job around 2013 as the loan sharks had gone to her workplace to create a scene.

> (d)     To pay off the debts, the accused and her husband had to sell their matrimonial flat and live in a rental flat instead. However, they eventually ran out of money and had to rent a room instead.

> (e)     In late 2013, the accused’s husband had gambled once more and was in debt yet again. Her trying circumstances led her to attempt suicide in 2014, though she stopped herself after thinking of her children.

> (f)     In 2015, the accused was experiencing numbness, depersonalisation and derealisation, and started experiencing pseudo-hallucinations. The accused was not in a state to work and was filled with much anxiety as the loan sharks were harassing her and threatening her with her sons’ lives if she defaulted on her repayments.

> (g)     The Defence submitted that it was during this period that the accused committed the offences out of stress, pressure, fear and sheer desperation.

43     In addition, the Defence highlighted that the accused was diagnosed with major depression disorder in September 2016 (_ie_, after the period of offending). The accused was diagnosed after she was admitted to hospital for a serious but failed suicide attempt.

44     As regards the mitigating factors after the commission of the offences, the Defence submitted the following:

> (a)     The accused was extremely remorseful for her actions and deeply regretted her decisions.

> (b)     The accused has made voluntary restitution of $26,200, notwithstanding that she had still been facing harassment from loan sharks during that time.

> (c)     The accused’s impending incarceration would result in much hardship to her family, especially her children.

> (d)     The accused’s husband has since turned away from gambling and her relationship with her husband has improved greatly. As a result, the accused’s mental health has improved and she has sought re-employment. Presently, the accused and her husband run a pet grooming and pet supplies business together.

> (e)     The accused readily volunteered information to the relevant investigation officers when questioned and was willing to cooperate. This was a position accepted by the Prosecution.[^4]

> (f)     The accused has pleaded guilty and did not waste judicial resources. The accused was also untraced.

> (g)     The accused has volunteered her time to help the needy where possible, and has participated in various volunteer work and activities.

> (h)     Notwithstanding her financial woes and turbulent relationship with her father, the accused continued to support her father’s medical expenses every fortnightly.

### Defence’s submissions on sentence

45     The Defence submitted for a global sentence of 13 months’ imprisonment.

#### Forgery for the purposes of cheating under s 468 PC

46     The Defence agreed with the Prosecution’s observation of the 12-month benchmark for offences under s 468 of the PC in _Lim Ek Kian_ (see \[29\] above). However, the Defence sought to distinguish the two cases of _Choy Yut Hong_ and _Tang Wai Kit_, and urged the court to consider the unreported case of _Ang Hui Hoon Candace v PP_ MA 146/2009 (“_Candace Ang_”), where a global sentence of two months’ imprisonment was imposed for two proceeded charges under s 468 of the PC. The Defence tendered an excerpt of _Candace Ang_ from a textbook in support.

47     Having regard to the mitigating factors and sentencing precedents, the Defence submitted that a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment each for DAC-923529-2019 and DAC-923530-2019, and eight months’ imprisonment for DAC-923537-2019 would be sufficient.

#### Cheating under s 420 PC

48     The Defence agreed that the present case would fall within the slight harm and low culpability band of the sentencing framework in _Gene Chong_. However, the Defence disagreed with the Prosecution’s sentencing submission of two to three months’ imprisonment, and instead submitted that one to two months would suffice. This was for the following reasons:

> (a)     The level of sophistication of the offence under s 420 of the PC was low.

> (b)     It was an isolated incident and the accused had no prior antecedents.

> (c)     The accused has suffered from major depression disorder.

49     The Defence also cited the decision of _Public Prosecutor v Husniyati binte Omar_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 255</span> (“_Husniyati_”), which laid down sentencing ranges for s 420 PC offences involving property on which monetary value could be placed. In particular, the court held at \[81(i)\] of _Husniyati_ that where the “benefit/loss arising is in the range of $5,000 to $10,000, the sentencing benchmark should be in the range of 2 to 6 months”. Relying on _Husniyati_, the Defence submitted that the Prosecution’s submission of two to three months’ imprisonment was rather excessive given that the amount involved was $1,978.

#### Total sentence across the proceeded charges

50     The Defence submitted that a total imprisonment term of 13 months would suffice, the breakdown of which is set out below:

### Decision on sentence

51     The offences under s 468 and s 420 of the PC each attract a mandatory imprisonment term of up to 10 years, and the offender shall also be liable to a fine.

52     As was observed by the court in _Choy Yut Hong_, which similarly involved offences under s 468 and s 420, the “primary yardstick in determining the seriousness of the offending is the amount involved” (at \[43\]). In particular, the court considered that the “seriousness of the offending must be measured against the full sum … obtained as a result of the deception” and not just the total gain to the offender (at \[43\]). It was also clear to me, from the approach adopted by both the Prosecution and the Defence in their sentencing submissions, that the amount involved was a relevant factor to be considered in sentencing.

#### Forgery for the purposes of cheating under s 468 PC

53     I was guided by the benchmark sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment for offences under s 468 of the PC, as observed by the court at \[35\] of _Lim Ek Kian_. I considered this to be a useful starting point for the present offences under s 468 of the PC.

54     The offender in _Lim Ek Kian_ was convicted after trial on a single charge under s 468 of the PC. The offender was the managing director of a car distributor. He was found to have forged signatures on transfer forms and presented them to an officer of the Land Transport Authority (“LTA”), to deceive the LTA into transferring rebates from one customer to another. The amount involved was $9,237. The High Court dismissed the offender’s appeal and affirmed the lower court’s sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment. The High Court noted that the offender’s actions had “adversely affected public perception of the system of rebates transfer and also of the car selling industry in general” (at \[37\] of _Lim Ek Kian_).

55     The amount involved in the present case was significantly higher than that in _Lim Ek Kian_. For the three proceeded charges under s 468 of the PC, the amounts involved ranged from $32,000 to $50,000. To this end, I took reference from the reported decisions of _Choy Yut Hong_ and _Tang Wai Kit_, as cited by the Prosecution, which involved amounts of a higher quantum.

56     In _Choy Yut Hong_, the offences related to a rental scam orchestrated by a property agent, who, amongst others, forged signatures on the tenancy agreements to induce various tenants to deliver monies to the offender. The offender faced a total of 49 charges under both s 468 and s 420 of the PC, with seven charges proceeded with. The total amount involved was $546,012, and the offender was sentenced to a total of 60 months’ imprisonment. The Prosecution highlighted one of the proceeded charges under s 468 of the PC involving $50,400, for which the sentence was 15 months’ imprisonment. The appeal against the decision was dismissed by the High Court.

57     In _Tang Wai Kit_, the offender had cheated and forged to cheat on 17 different occasions. He faced a total of 17 charges under both s 468 and s 420 of the PC, with six charges proceeded with. The total loss amounted to an approximate sum of $590,050 and the offender was sentenced to a total of 84 months’ imprisonment. One of the offences under s 468 of the PC involved a sum of $26,910, and the sentence imposed was 15 months’ imprisonment. The appeal against the decision was withdrawn.

58     The Defence sought to distinguish the cases of _Choy Yut Hong_ and _Tang Wai Kit_, and urged the court to instead consider _Candace Ang_. First, I did not think that the distinguishing factors raised by the Defence were significantly different from the present circumstances, for the following reasons:

> (a)     As regards _Choy Yut Hong_, the Defence submitted that the offender in that case had not been genuinely remorseful for his offences as he had committed further offences after his first arrest and even absconded after being charged in court. I noted that the accused in this case did not commit any further offences upon her arrest. Nonetheless, and prior to her arrest, there was a considerable period of offending, which spanned from 2013 to 2016 across both the proceeded charges and the charges which were taken into consideration. To that end, I did not think that the accused could be considered a first time offender.

> (b)     As regards _Tung Wai Kit_, the Defence submitted that the offender in that case had made no restitution to the victims and had implied a certain degree of lacking in remorse by stating that the ill-gotten gains had gone to the unlicensed moneylenders and casinos. The offender in _Tang Wai Kit_ had landed in such a situation due to his gambling addiction, whereas the accused’s predicament in the present case was a result of her husband’s gambling debts. I did not consider this to be of much assistance to the Defence. While the accused had made some restitution here, this was a small percentage of the total losses suffered by the victims. I also did not see how cheating victims for her husband’s gambling debts could be any much more mitigatory than if she were to cheat for her own gambling debts.

59     Second, as regards the Defence’s reliance on _Candace Ang_, I did not consider this to be useful.

60     The Defence had merely tendered a textbook extract and there were no written grounds of decision before the court. Based on the textbook extract, the offender in _Candace Ang_ had forged her husband’s signature on bank and insurance documents to make unauthorised withdrawals. These unauthorised withdrawals totalled up to $152,453.22, and were used to settle personal debts and other expenses. The offender was a first offender who had pleaded guilty to two charges under s 468 of the PC, with four to be taken into consideration. The offender did not make any restitution, and instead agreed with her husband and mother-in-law to forego her right to claim maintenance for their one-year-old child if she was not required to make restitution. On appeal, the court reduced the offender’s sentence from 12 months’ imprisonment per charge to two months’ imprisonment per charge, to be run concurrently.

61     As the High Court commented in _Abdul Mutalib bin Aziman v Public Prosecutor and ors_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 4 SLR 1220</span>, “absent a reasoned judgment explaining a particular sentencing decision, bare reference to the outcomes in other cases will seldom be useful” (at \[99\]).

62     In any event, it was clear even from the textbook extract that the judge in _Candace Ang_ considered that the reduced sentence of two months was not to be taken as a general precedent. The Defence had itself acknowledged this, but nonetheless argued that there were extreme factual similarities in _Candace Ang_ and the present situation. I found it difficult to see how this was so, particularly without the benefit of the full facts of _Candace Ang_. For one, _Candace Ang_ appeared to involve misappropriation of monies within the family, whereas the present case involved an insurance fraud. The relevance of _Candace Ang_ as a precedent was therefore, to my mind, extremely limited.

63     On the facts of the present case, I agreed with Prosecution that there were various aggravating factors, which warranted the sending a strong deterrent signal against like-minded individuals who might be tempted to do the same.

64     First, the accused’s acts were no doubt serious and have the effect of undermining the delivery and integrity of insurance services in Singapore. It is common practice in Singapore for insurance policies to be sold through agents like the accused. Should there be increased instances of agents forging insurance documents for their own benefit, it would plausibly lead to increased efforts and costs on the part of the insurance company and the industry as a whole to enhance security measures to prevent the same, so as to assure potential clients of the authenticity of the insurance policies.

65     Second, there had been a clear abuse of trust. The accused was working as an insurance agent with the respective insurance companies (HSBC and AIA) at the material time of the offences. The accused was able to obtain access to existing insurance contracts by virtue of her position. The victims trusted the accused and thought that they were buying legitimate insurance contracts which would give them returns in due course. However, she abused her position and the trust reposed in her by forging insurance contracts and cheating the victims of their money.

66     Third, there was a degree of premeditation. The accused forged the insurance contracts using copies of existing contracts. Specifically, for the AIA contracts, she created the forged documents using a computer at an internet café and copied the AIA letterhead and signatures from an existing contract. To my mind, this exhibited careful planning and execution of the forgery.

67     Fourth, as the forged documents were based off existing contracts, the offences would have been difficult to detect. These would have looked like standard insurance contracts. Thinking that the contracts were genuine, the unsuspecting victims in this case executed the forged documents that were prepared and presented to them by their insurance agent, the accused, and delivered their monies to the accused.

68     Fifth, and as mentioned at \[58(a)\] above, while the accused was untraced, I noted that the total period of offending across both the proceeded charges and charges taken into consideration for sentencing (under s 468 of the PC) spanned from 2013 to 2016. In such circumstances, I was unable to regard the accused as a first time offender.

69     The Defence, in both its written mitigation plea and during oral submissions, placed much emphasis on the major depression disorder which the accused was diagnosed with in September 2016. Notwithstanding that, and as the Defence had conceded at the hearing on 9 December 2021, there was no evidence before the court that the accused was suffering from major depression disorder at the time of the offences. Neither was there any evidence that the major depression disorder had contributed to the commission of the offences.

70     To this end, the observations of the High Court in _Ng So Kuen Connie v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 3 SLR(R) 178</span> (“_Connie Ng_”) were apposite (at \[58\]):

> … However, I found that … the element of general deterrence can and should be given considerably less weight if the offender was suffering from a mental disorder _at the time of the commission of the offence_. This is particularly so if there is a _causal link_ between the mental disorder and the commission of the offence…

> \[emphasis added in italics\]

71     The Court of Appeal in _Lim Ghim Peow v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 1287</span> (“_Lim Ghim Peow_”) made a similar observation (at \[35\]):

> We would therefore reiterate that _the existence of a mental disorder on the part of the offender does not automatically reduce the importance of the principle of general deterrence in sentencing._ Much depends on the circumstances of each individual case. If the nature of the mental disorder is such that it does not affect the offender’s capacity to appreciate the gravity and significance of his criminal conduct, the application of the sentencing principle of general deterrence may not be greatly affected.

> \[emphasis added in italics\]

72     As discussed at \[69\] above, there was no evidence before the court that the accused had suffered from major depressive disorder at the time of the commission of the offences. Neither was there any evidence of any causal link between the major depressive disorder and the commission of the offence. The accused was only diagnosed with major depressive disorder in September 2016, which was after the commission of the offences. Guided by the principles set out in _Connie Ng_ and _Lim Ghim Peow_, I was of the view that the principle of general deterrence was not displaced by the accused’s major depressive disorder in the present case.

73     All considered, I imposed the following sentences in relation to the three offences under s 468 of the PC:

> (a)     DAC-923529-2019: 18 months’ imprisonment;

> (b)     DAC-923530-2019: 18 months’ imprisonment; and

> (c)     DAC-923537-2019: 16 months’ imprisonment.

74     In particular, I considered it relevant that the amount involved in DAC-923537-2019 was lower than that in the other two charges, and I calibrated the sentence accordingly. While I was cognisant of the difficult and trying circumstances faced by the accused, as set out in detail in the mitigation plea and emphasised by the Defence at the hearing, I was unable to disregard the losses caused to the victims here. In particular, the first victim was most adversely affected, and she suffered losses amounting to $273,000 across both the proceeded charges and charges which were taken into consideration. Of the losses caused to the first victim, the accused only made restitution of $21,200.

#### Cheating under s 420 PC

75     As regards the offence under s 420 of the PC, I agreed with both Prosecution and Defence that this fell within the band of low culpability and slight harm. Based on the sentencing framework set out in _Gene Chong_, this would correspond to a starting point of up to six months’ imprisonment.

76     In coming to my sentence, I found the following factors relevant:

> (a)     The amount involved was on the lower end – the two iPhones which were delivered to the accused as a result of the cheating were valued at $1,978.

> (b)     The level of sophistication was low. The accused presented the fourth victim’s NRIC to the StarHub staff that attended to her, and the staff proceeded to prepare a contract in the name of the fourth victim.

> (c)     It was nonetheless aggravating that there had been an abuse of trust in this case. The fourth victim had entrusted the accused with her NRIC for the accused to assist with the paying of bills. Instead, the accused misused the NRIC to cheat StarHub into believing that the accused was the fourth victim.

> (d)     While the accused was untraced, there was another charge under s 420 of the PC that was taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.

> (e)     While no restitution was made to StarHub, restitution of $5,000 was made to the fourth victim in respect of the other s 420 charge which was taken into consideration (_ie_, DAC-923535-2019).

> (f)     The accused pleaded guilty.

77     All considered, I imposed a sentence of one month’s imprisonment on the proceeded charge under s 420 of the PC (_ie_, DAC-923536-2019).

#### Sentences to run consecutively or concurrently

78     Having determined the individual sentences (see \[73\] and \[77\] above), I now turn to consider how these individual sentences ought to be ordered to run. In this regard, s 307(1) of the CPC provides that where a person was convicted for at least three distinct offences, the sentences for at least two of those offences were to run consecutively. In this case, the accused was convicted for a total of four distinct offences.

79     The Prosecution and the Defence took different positions on the number of sentences that ought to be run consecutively. The Prosecution submitted for two charges under s 468 of the PC (_ie_, DAC-923529-2019 and DAC-923537-2019) and one charge under s 420 of the PC (_ie_, DAC-923536-2019) to run consecutively, with the remaining s 468 PC charge to run concurrently. In contrast, the Defence urged the court to run only one s 468 PC charge (_ie_, DAC-923529-2019) and one s 420 PC charge (_ie_, DAC-923536-2019) consecutively, with two other s 468 PC charges to run concurrently.

80     In light of the differences in positions, I referred parties to the cases of _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> (“_Shouffee_”) and _Public Prosecutor v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 799</span> (“_Raveen_”). I asked that parties make submissions on their positions with reference to the principles expounded in those cases, in particular, the one transaction rule and the totality principle.

81     The Prosecution submitted that three sentences ought to run consecutively as they pertained to distinct victims, spanned distinct time periods, and involved a distinct infringement of interests.[^5] Further, taking a last look at the overall sentence, the total of running three sentences consecutively would not be one that was crushing and disproportionate to the offender’s criminality.[^6] The Prosecution added that the lower end of their sentencing position (_ie_, 36 months’ imprisonment) would be in line with precedents, considering that the total amount involved was in excess of $330,000.[^7] The sentence of 36 months’ imprisonment could not be said to be manifestly excessive.[^8]

82     The Defence relied on s 307(1) of the CPC, which provided that at least two sentences were to run consecutively. On that basis, the Defence was seeking for two sentences to run consecutively, with the remaining two to run concurrently. In elaboration, the Defence said that this was because there were only four victims altogether, and the victim named in DAC-923529-2019 and DAC-923530-2019 were the same.[^9] When I asked the Defence to support its position with reference to _Shouffee_ and _Raveen_, the Defence responded that it did not have a good explanation, but having regard to the totality principle, at least two must run consecutively and the Defence chose for the submitted two sentences to run consecutively.[^10] The Defence concluded by stating that it was hoping for the best for the accused, and urged the court to take into account the circumstances relating to the offences.[^11]

83     The Defence further referred the court to two newspaper reports in support of its total sentencing position:

> (a)     The first related to one Loh Zhi Xiang (“Loh”), who, based on the newspaper report, was involved in misappropriating more than $461,000 entrusted to investment companies. He pleaded guilty to two counts of criminal breach of trust and a charge relating to acquiring, possessing, using, concealing or transferring the benefits of criminal conduct. Loh was sentenced to one and a half years’ jail for his actions.

> (b)     The second related to one Jaya Rethinasamy Ghandhi (“Jaya”). Based on the newspaper report, Jaya ran a Ponzi scheme for a period of two years, cheating 22 victims and causing them to lose nearly $700,000 in total. Jaya pleaded guilty to 20 charges, including 16 counts of cheating, with 158 charges taken into consideration for sentencing. Jaya was sentenced to 25 months and five weeks’ jail, as well as a fine of $5,000.

84     It was the Defence’s position that the sentence of 36 months as submitted by Prosecution was crushing in light of the two cases Loh and Jaya, particularly Jaya’s case.[^12] However, the Defence acknowledged that it did not tender any material before the court in relation to the two cases of Loh and Jaya, apart from the newspaper reports.[^13] The Defence also accepted the general proposition that unreported cases would not serve as good guidance for the sentencing court.[^14]

85     I first considered the Defence’s reliance on the newspaper reports on the outcomes of the cases of Loh and Jaya. As mentioned at \[61\] above, a sentencing court should be slow to rely on unreported decisions. Amongst others, the sentencing court would not have the benefit of the full facts of the cases and the reasoned grounds of the court. To my mind, it would not be prudent to compare, as the Defence did, the total amounts involved in the cases of Loh and Jaya with the total amount involved in the present case, and to extrapolate an appropriate sentence on that basis. This would disregard the fact-sensitive approach adopted by sentencing courts. In any event, it did not even appear from the newspaper reports tendered by the Defence that the cases of Loh and Jaya related to offences under s 468 of the PC. I thus considered them unreliable precedents for present purposes.

86     Next, in considering the appropriate total sentence, I was guided by the High Court decisions of _Shouffee_ and _Raveen_. In summary, the starting point was the “one transaction rule”, which would require the court to consider whether the offences were unrelated. This was determined by considering whether they involved a single invasion of the same legally protected interest. Thereafter, the court was to apply the totality principle and take a “last look” at all the facts and circumstances to ensure that the aggregate sentence was sufficient and proportionate to the offender’s overall criminality (see _Shouffee_ at \[26\] and _Raveen_ at \[98\]).

87     To recap, there were a total of four proceeded charges before the court. Of these, three were offences under s 468 of the PC – two were committed in December 2015 against the same victim (_ie_, DAC-923529-2019 and DAC-923530-2019) and the third was committed against a separate victim on 14 October 2013 (_ie_, DAC-923537-2019). These offences were largely of the same _modus operandi_, _ie_, that the accused forged insurance documents for the purposes of cheating the respective victims.

88     The fourth proceeded charge (_ie_, DAC-923536-2019) was a separate one under s 420 of the PC and did not relate to the forgery offences. For this, the accused had deceived StarHub and dishonestly induced StarHub to deliver two iPhone 6s to the accused.

89     To my mind, it was clear that there were three distinct instances of offences across the four proceeded charges. The first was the two charges under s 468 of the PC in December 2015 against the same victim, Wong Lee Lieng. The second was the remaining charge under s 468 of the PC in October 2013 against a different victim, Lee Han Tiong. The third was the charge under s 420 of the PC in September 2014, by deceiving StarHub. On the facts of the case, these three incidents were “plainly separate and unrelated”, “took place on different locations”, were committed in different years, and “involved different victims”. I found that there was “no unity of purpose or design” as across these three instances of offending (_Raveen_ at \[102\]). Accordingly, I was of the view that it would be consistent with the one transaction rule for one of the s 468 PC charges from December 2015, the s 468 PC charge from October 2013, and the s 420 PC charge from September 2014 to run consecutively. This would result in a total aggregate sentence of 35 months’ imprisonment.

90     Moving next to the totality principle, I considered that the total sentence of 35 months’ imprisonment was sufficient and proportionate to the offender’s overall criminality on the facts of the case. I did not consider that the “aggregate sentence \[was\] substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of offences committed” in this case (_Raveen_ at \[98(c)\]). By way of example, from the precedent of _Tang Wai Kit_ cited by the Prosecution, the accused in that case had been sentenced to 36 months in respect of one of the proceeded charges under s 468 of the PC. I also did not think that the “effect of the sentence on the \[accused was\] crushing and not in keeping with \[her\] past records and future prospects” (_Raveen_ at \[98(c)\]).

91     For the reasons set out above, I was satisfied that an order for the following three sentences, _ie_, DAC-923529-2019, DAC-923536-2019 and DAC-923537-2019, to run consecutively was appropriate having regard to the totality of the facts.

## Conclusion

92     In summary, I imposed an aggregate sentence of 35 months’ imprisonment on the accused. I was of the view that this was proportionate to the overall criminality presented and would not be crushing on the accused.
