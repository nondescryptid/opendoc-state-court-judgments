\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9328/2020/01.\]

31 January 2020

### District Judge John Ng:

A community sentence under Part XVII of the Criminal Procedure Code (Chapter 68, 2010 Rev Ed.)(“CPC”) was passed on Hoon Qi Tong (male/25) (hereinafter referred to as “the Offender”), aged 23 years old at the time of offence. This is an appeal by the Public Prosecutor (“PP”) against the community orders imposed on 19 December 2019. The Offender was ordered to be detained in prison for the maximum period of **14 days under a Short Detention Order (“SDO”)** and to perform **130 hours of Community Service**. The orders have been stayed after the PP had filed an appeal against them and applied for a stay of execution.

2       The Offender had pleaded guilty to one charge of insulting the modesty of a woman under Section 509 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2012 Rev Ed.)(“PC”). He had used a hand phone to record a video clip of the woman easing herself in a toilet. He also admitted to a related charge for the offence of criminal trespass under s447 PC and consented to have it taken into consideration for sentence (“TIC offence”). This was for entering the female toilet to commit the s509 PC offence. The Offender unreservedly admitted to the Statement of Facts presented by the Prosecution and was convicted accordingly. The offence under s509 PC is punishable with imprisonment which may extend to one year, or with fine or both.

3       I took time to consider the sentence to be passed. On the day of sentencing, I spelt out the main reasons for my decision in a written Sentencing Remarks. A copy of the Sentencing Remarks is annexed to this Grounds of Decision.

## Detailed Reasons for the Sentence

4       The Offender had no criminal records. At the time of the commission of the offences on 13 September 2017, he was 23 years old and an undergraduate at a local university. He has since graduated in 2019. A Pre-sentence report was called for to determine his suitability for Probation under the Probation of Offenders Act (Chapter 252, 1985 Rev Ed.) The Probation and Community Rehabilitation Service found the Offender to be suitable for Probation and recommended Probation of 21 months and to perform 110 hours of Community Service. However, the Deputy Public Prosecutor (“DPP”) sought to challenge the recommendation and she was given the opportunity to cross-examine the Probation Officer on his report. Thereafter, Submissions on Sentence were put up by the DPP and Defence Counsel (“DC”).

5       In view of the assessment in the psychiatric reports, from the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) and from the Winslow Clinic, that the Offender had a background of a Persistent Depressive Disorder (DSM-5) at and around the time of the offences, a Mandatory Treatment Order (“MTO”) Suitability report was called for under s339(2) CPC. However, Dr Derrick Yeo (Consultant, Department of Forensic Psychiatry, IMH), the appointed psychiatrist under s339(13) CPC, did not recommend the Offender to be placed on Mandatory Treatment. In view of the recommendation of the appointed psychiatrist, together with the Court being satisfied with the reasons he had given for not recommending treatment, I found that an MTO would not be an appropriate sentencing option for the Offender.

6       I invited the parties to submit on the imposition of the community sentence of a short detention in prison in view of two key aspects I saw in this case. I was persuaded by the Prosecution that a custodial sentence was warranted but at the same time, there were good prospects of rehabilitation evident in the Probation Report.

7       After giving due consideration to the respective submissions on the appropriateness of imposing community sentences on the Offender, I was inclined to impose an SDO combined with a CSO (Community Service Order). As required by the CPC, I called for a CSO suitability report. Section 346(1) CPC provides that, if the court is satisfied that it is expedient with a view to the reformation of an offender that he makes amends to the community for the offence by performing community service, the court may make a community service order requiring the offender to perform any unpaid community service under the supervision of a community service officer. It is also provided in s346(3) CPC that a court must call for a report from a community service officer on the suitability of the offender to perform community service.

8       I decided to call for the CSO suitability report as I was of the view that it was expedient for the Offender to make amends to the community. The community service officer, who was also the same officer who had prepared the Probation Report, found the Offender to be suitable for community service and recommended for him to perform 130 hours of community service within 12 months at one of the CSO agencies listed in the report. I accepted his recommendation and imposed 130 hours of community service in addition to the maximum period of detention of 14 days under the SDO.

#### Determining the Appropriateness of Community Sentences

9       I was unable to accept the Prosecution’s submissions that the community sentencing options are insufficient to meet the objectives of sentencing in this case. Community sentences, as stipulated in Part XVII of the CPC, seek to offer offenders the opportunity to make reparation for their offences (through community service), to be treated (through MTO), to receive short punitive correction (through SDO) and to move on from their first missteps in their lives. In my view, the suite of community sentences provided by Parliament ought to be seriously considered by the courts to rehabilitate and reform first-time offenders (who are not precluded by s337 CPC), unless the offence is so serious that a community sentence is disproportionately inadequate.

10     The DPP strongly argued that the Offender ought to receive a sentence of at least 8 weeks’ imprisonment for, _inter alia_, the following reasons:

> ·    Deterrence is the dominant sentencing consideration.

> ·    The offence was committed consciously, with planning and premeditation.

> ·    The offence was committed with a recording device.

> ·    There was a high degree of intrusion into the privacy of the victim.

> ·    The victim continues to suffer the effects of the crime.

11     I agree with the Prosecution on the seriousness of the offence requiring the need for deterrence. However, the need for deterrence does not mean that the sentencing objective of rehabilitation is to be totally displaced. This is particularly relevant when the prospect for reform and rehabilitation is high, as can be seen from the positive Probation Report. The Offender is a relatively young adult and this is his first brush with the law.

12     I accept that the various reasons cited by the DPP are valid for the imposition of a custodial sentence, despite the strong recommendation for Probation by the Probation and Community Rehabilitation Service officer. Nevertheless, I am of the view that even though a custodial sentence is warranted in the circumstances of this case, the Offender could be appropriately dealt with by the combined use of the community sentences of SDO and CSO under s338 CPC. The SDO would meet the general and specific deterrent effect of a custodial sentence and the CSO would provide the reparative dimension to the community. After these sanctions have been meted out, the Offender, who possessed the necessary characteristics and with ample familial support, would be able to be re-integrated immediately into society.

13     In my view, the sentence in the higher range as suggested by the DPP is due to her severe characterisation of the offending act. An example of the DPP’s overstating the nature of the Offender’s act is found at Paragraph 1 of the Prosecution’s Further Skeletal Submissions of 8 November 2019, wherein she described it as “a heinous act”. This case was patently unlike the facts in the case of _PP v Chong Hou En_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 222</span> where the victims were recorded naked for a significant length of time while taking showers in the bathroom. This case is also less serious than the case of _PP v Edmund Chong_, MCN 901943/2019 where the offender used his mobile phone and recorded a video of the victim fully naked and showering.

#### Guidance from the High Court on CBS (Community-Based Sentence) in general and SDO in particular

14     In the case of _Sim Wen Yi Ernest v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 207</span> (“_Sim Wen Yi Ernest_”), See Kee Oon JC (as he then was) decided that probation was not a suitable order on the facts of the case before him. He held that while there were relevant mitigating factors and chances of effective rehabilitation, the nature of the offences was serious and deserving of strong approbation. There were significant aggravating features which militated against the grant of a probation order and a measure of general deterrence was also necessary.

15     In _Sim Wen Yi Ernest_, the crux of the issue, as stated by JC See, was whether the appellant, who was over 26 years old at the time of the offending, was a suitable candidate for a combination of CBSs. He went on to identify the legislative intent underlying the CBS framework and stated that CBSs were introduced to allow greater flexibility in balancing the various sentencing principles in individual cases. In the case before him, while general deterrence remained relevant, it could be achieved with a carefully calibrated mix of CBS options and a short custodial sentence in the form of an SDO would likely be sufficient to keep him away from crime in the future. A combination of CBSs in the form of an SDO and a CSO was therefore the outcome that would best reflect the interplay of sentencing objectives in that case. An SDO carries a punitive and deterrent element and this would suitably address the issue of his culpability.

16     In deciding which CBS order to impose, the Court will consider two aspects – the type of offence and the type of offender. There is no fixed formula as to which of these two aspects should take precedence in deciding the orders to be made. The sentencing exercise will necessarily be sensitive to the facts of the case and the rehabilitative prospects of the offender. JC See also noted that offenders over the age of 21 should not _ipso facto_ be denied the opportunity to be considered for CBS.

#### Application to the present case

17     In the present case, I have found that the CBS option of the SDO combined with a CSO most suitable to achieve the twin goals of deterrence and rehabilitation. Neither sentencing principle should trump the other.

18     Hoon Qi Tong is a first offender for the offence and does not have any brush with the law prior to that. His offending occurred while he was still a student in a tertiary institution. He has a supportive family. The various positive factors in the Probation report on his prospects for rehabilitation are important indicators that he can be given an opportunity to stay free from committing similar offences in the future, after serving his short prison term and completing his reparation to the community by fulfilling the CSO hours.

19     I have also taken into account the psychiatric reports of Dr Derrick Yeo and Dr Winslow in assessing the type of offender before me. Both psychiatrists have diagnosed him as suffering from Dysthymia or Persistent Depressive Disorder (DSM-5) at the time of the commission of the offence. As the appointed psychiatrist under s339(13) CPC, Dr Derrick Yeo confirmed in his clarification report of 18 September 2019 that the Persistent Depressive Disorder was a mild but existent contributing factor for his commission of the offence. Dr Yeo opined that whilst laboring under his Persistent Depressive Disorder, his low mood caused him to opportunistically engage in the offensive acts with poor judgement and without due consideration to the consequences.

20     Although the Prosecution had demanded for a more significant period of punishment behind bars, there is no compelling reason to deny him a combination of CBS orders to achieve the salutary effects of deterrence and saving effects of rehabilitation. I did not accept the submission of the DPP that imposing CBS orders would signal to the public that the courts view the offences as being “minor” or “not serious”. It is only a failure to appreciate the nature of the various CBS orders and their respective purposes in dealing with individual offenders that could lead to such a mis-perception. A combination of community orders under s338 CPC is the appropriate sentence in this case.

## Conclusion

21     The SDO would result in the Offender spending time in jail for his offence and would dispel any notion that he is being let off without being punished. This would be consistent with the sentencing principle of retribution, for causing harm to the victim. The stint in prison would also serve as a reminder to him of the real and significant consequence of his actions, should he be tempted to commit similar offences again. The imposition of 130 hours of community service under the CSO, in addition to the SDO, addresses the element of reparation to the community for the offending acts of this young man.

Magistrate’s Court – MACs 903868-9/2018

19 December 2019

## SENTENCING REMARKS

These are the main reasons for my sentencing decision:

1       The Prosecution is asking for a jail term of at least 8 weeks’ imprisonment for the Offender. I accept the Prosecution’s submissions that custodial sentences are warranted for offences of Insulting the Modesty of a Woman, under Section 509 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224), involving the recording of females using the toilet, even though the culprits are first offenders and have pleaded guilty.

2       Deterrence is a dominant sentencing principle for such cases. Nonetheless, in a case where there are strong countervailing factors for utilising Community-Based Sentencing (“CBS”) options, the Court has to consider if the offender is suitable for a combination of CBS orders.

3       In this case, the Offender, Hoon Qi Tong, had been assessed by the Probation Service to be a suitable candidate for Probation of 21 months and to attend offence-specific treatment programmes targeting his sexualised behaviours. The Prosecution is objecting to Probation for the Offender.

4       The Defence Counsel had also made a submission for the imposition of a Mandatory Treatment Order (“MTO”). The MTO Suitability Report under Section 339(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68) (“CPC”) was called for. The appointed psychiatrist under Section 339(13) CPC from the Institute of Mental Health had prepared the MTO report and he was of the opinion that the Offender suffered from Persistent Depressive Disorder at and around the time of the index offence. However, this was only a mild but existent contributing factor for his commission of the offence. The appointed psychiatrist therefore concluded that, due to the lack of any significant contributory link of his mental conditions to the offending behaviour, he was not a suitable candidate for MTO.

5       In my consideration of the appropriate sentence, I have been very much guided by the High Court cases of _Sim Wen Yi Ernest v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 207</span> (“_Sim Wen Yi Ernest_”) and _PP v Teo Chang Heng_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1163</span> (“_Teo Chang Heng_”). In _Sim Wen Yi Ernest_, Judicial Commissioner See Kee Oon (as he then was) held that the important point about the CBS framework is that:

> “… the suitability of the various types of CBS orders depends on the type of offender and the type of offence. This calls for an open-textured assessment that is highly contextualised and the court must have regard to all the facts of the case. Some types of CBS may have greater relevance in the cases which involve youthful offenders since such offenders are often seen to have greater rehabilitative capacity. Nevertheless, I did not think that offenders over the age of 21 should _ipso facto_ be denied the opportunity to be considered for CBS. The rehabilitative aim does not automatically recede into the background once the offender reaches 21 years of age.” (_at Paragraph 40 of the judgment_)

6       In _Teo Chang Heng_, Justice See Kee Oon held in Paragraph 12 of his judgment that “the palette of CBS options also caters for cases which call for short imprisonment terms in the form of SDOs (Short Detention Orders), which are “less disruptive and stigmatising than a longer prison stay” (citing a parliamentary report of a Minister at col 426)”. Further on in that same judgment, in Paragraph 15, Justice See repeated his observation in _Sim Wen Yi Ernest_ that “a SDO does carry a punitive element and is inherently also capable of serving to deter. … a SDO should not be perceived as a soft option. After all, the consequence is that the accused person will be incarcerated pursuant to a SDO and will be deprived of his liberty.”

7       In the present case, the custodial threshold is clearly crossed. The harm caused by the Offender, as is apparent from the victim’s letter tendered by the Prosecution (admissible under Section 228(2)(b) CPC), cannot be ignored by the Court. In this respect, another classic principle of sentencing in the form of the Principle of Retribution is a relevant consideration.

8       The SDO would result in the Offender spending time in jail for his offence and would dispel any notion that he is being let off without being punished. The stint in prison would also serve as a reminder to him of the real and significant consequence of his actions, should he be tempted to commit similar offences again. This is an expression of the Principle of Specific Deterrence.

9       For the key reasons I have outlined above, a Combination of SDO and CSO is appropriate. It is hereby ordered that the Offender, Hoon Qi Tong, undergo the maximum 14 days of detention in Prison under Section 348(1) CPC and perform 130 hours of Community Service as recommended by the Community Service Officer in the CSO suitability report. The Community Service Order is imposed under Section 346(1) CPC.

10     The Combination of the CBS sentencing options of SDO and CSO should be sufficiently robust to meet the competing demands of the various sentencing objectives of punishment, deterrence and rehabilitation of the Offender in this case.
