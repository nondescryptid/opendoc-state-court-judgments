2       The Accused was found guilty and was convicted on all the charges. He was sentence to a total sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane.

## Case for Prosecution

3       The case for the Prosecution rested mainly on the victim who was about 19 years old at the time of the offence. The victim was a China National who had come to Singapore as a student. The Prosecution has also tendered 23 CCTV footages taken from the basement carpark of Concorde Hotel and Concorde Hotel. See P2 (1-23).

4       The victim testified that on 9 December 2017, she and her friends attended a Zouk festival held at Sentosa, partying and drinking. She was there until about 6**\-**7 am in the morning of 10 December 2017 when she decided to go home. When she and her two friends were at the side of the taxi stand, the Accused drove his vehicle bearing registration number SLA 8797J ('the car') and approached her whether she needed a ride. The victim called the car a party car as it was blasting with music. The victim accepted the offer and only she alone boarded the vehicle. She was told to sit at the front passenger seat. The Accused was told to send her home.

5       While the car was in motion, the Accused held on to her hand when the victim was sitting unsteadily even though the victim had her seat belt fastened. When the car stopped at the traffic light junction, the Accused kissed her on the mouth and with his tongue for a few seconds. The victim was stunned. She dare not looked at the Accused but looked out of the window. When the car reached the Orchard area, the victim realised that the Accused was not going towards the direction of her home. Instead, the Accused drove and parked at the basement car park within the premises of Concord Hotel/mall. The victim thought that the Accused was waiting to pick up another passenger.

6       At the basement car park, the Accused alighted and stood outside the front passenger seat. He then boarded the car and asked the victim whether she was staying alone and whether he can go over to her place. The victim rejected his request. The Accused then started to kiss her, and used his hand to touch and squeeze her breast. The Accused promised to send her home "if you help me" which the victim understood it to mean having sex. The victim was confused and frightened. The Accused got out of the car and pulled her out of her seat. He then opened the backseat door and pushed her into it. The Accused then sat on her thigh area, used his hand to squeeze her breast, touch the vagina area, and kissed her. These lasted for a few seconds. The victim felt disgusted, scared and wanted to go home. She pushed the Accused away, opened the car door and ran out. The Accused followed her and persistently offered to send her home. The Accused suddenly caught hold of her and she resisted by squatting. The Accused wanted her to pay for the ride. She purportedly agreed and asked him to drive the car over, thinking that this would provide her the opportunity to call for help. As the Accused walked away, the victim ran to the security personnel Jamaludin Bin Mohamed Ali (PW2) for help. PW2 was stationed at the loading bay area. The victim told PW2 that the Accused wanted to rape her. She used the word "rape" as she did not know how to say "molest" in English. In the meantime, the victim also called her ex-boyfriend and informed him about the molest. Exhibit P4-T indicated there was a call duration of 1 minute and 37 seconds.

7       PW2 brought the victim to the Fire Command Centre (FCC). From here, the victim went off to get a taxi to go home. While waiting for the taxi, the Accused and PW2 suddenly appeared before her. She then ran off into the Concord Shopping Mall and hid herself in the toilet without realising that it was a gent's toilet. This part of the event was consistent with the messages she sent to her ex-boyfriend. See exhibited P4-T.

8       Subsequently, someone told the victim to go to the women's toilet. In the meantime, the victim also sent text messages to her friend, one Annie, that she was nearly raped. See exhibit P5-T. Not long after, the police arrived.

9       What happened at the car park area and the shopping mall were captured partly by CCTV. See exhibit P2(1-23) containing 23 CCTV footages.

10     PW2 testified that 10 December 2017 was a Sunday and the car park area was quiet. He confirmed that the victim was crying when she ran to him for help. She appeared scared and nervous. He brought her to see his supervisor at the FCC. While they were in the lift to the FCC, the victim was still crying and nervous.

11     PW2's supervisor was one Stevens Paul Aswin (PW3). PW3 was the one who made a call to the Police. See exhibit P1. When PW3 first saw the victim, he noted that she was crying. PW3 testified that the victim did not want to remain in the FCC and went off to the main road, Kramat Lane. At Kramat Lane, PW3 also noted a vehicle with the driver (identified as the Accused). The Accused alighted, approached PW3, and inquired about the victim. PW3 told the Accused to give the victim "space" as he noted that the victim was in a state of distress. PW3 confirmed that the victim's boyfriend also arrived at the scene after the arrival of the Police.

## Case for Defence

12     Briefly, the Defence alleged that the Accused kissed the victim with her consent. He claimed that the victim did not resist him when he kissed her. The victim did not say yes or no to what he was doing. He also alleged that both were using the tongues when kissing. The Accused denied touching the victim's breast and vagina.

13     The Accused also testified that he was present at the scene when the police arrived. He intimated that this proved his innocence.

## The Law

14     It is trite law that in cases of sexual assault where one person’s word was being pitted against that of another, the victim’s evidence should be “unusually convincing or compelling” or otherwise corroborated by independent witnesses so that it could be relied upon to be the basis of a conviction. See _Haliffie bin Mamat v Public Prosecutor and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 636</span> at \[28\]-\[29\]_._

## Credibility of the Victim

15     In _Farida Begam d/o Mohd Arthan v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 592</span>, at \[9\] the High Court held that a judge can make a finding on the credibility of a witness based on some, or all, of the following factors:

> a.     His demeanour;

> b.     The internal consistency (or lack thereof) in the content of his evidence; and

> c.     The external consistency (or lack thereof) between the content of his evidence and extrinsic evidence (for example, the evidence of other witnesses, documentary evidence or exhibits).

16     Bearing this principle in mind, I found the victim to be a truthful witness. I also found that there was no reason for the victim to lie or frame the Accused.

17     In the course of the trial, I was able to observe the demeanour of the victim. She came across as forthcoming and truthful. She did not pretend that she could positively identify the Accused. In fact, she conceded she was unable to recognise him.

18     I found the victim’s evidence was consistent and measured. She did not embellish her evidence against the Accused. In fact, she was a candid witness. She admitted she smoked and drank. She also agreed that the Accused was a stranger to her. She candidly confessed that she could not remember certain details or was uncertain.

19     The account of the incident given in court by the victim was consistent with the CCTV footages.

20     The victim’s testimony was also consistent with the evidence of the other witnesses. At the available opportunity, the victim told PW2 that the Accused wanted to “rape” her as she did not know how to say “molest” in English.

21     Next, PW2’s unchallenged evidence was his observation of the victim’s demeanour and emotional state when she came to him for help. She was observed to be emotionally distressing. This was consistent with the testimony of the victim that she was scared. Her behaviour when she was at Concord Shopping Mall indicated something upsetting and distressing had happened to her. From the CCTV footages, it was clear that she was in a confused state and at a loss. Indeed, the victim was noted to be clinging on to PW2 for security. She even went into hiding in the toilet without realising that it was a male toilet. The victim’s demeanour was also corroborated by PW3. Clearly, the victim must have experienced something traumatic for her to react in the manner observed by PW2 and displayed the frantic behaviour as seen from the CCTV footage.

22     In the circumstances, I found the victim to be a credible and reliable witness. Accordingly, and in the light of the other evidence, I found the victim’s evidence to be “unusually convincing”. Independent witnesses also corroborated her certain aspects of her evidence. Her emotional state immediately after the incidents also supported the allegation of outraging of modesty.

## Credibility of the Defence

23     I rejected the Accused's bare assertion that he did not molest the victim by touching her breast and vagina. Neither did I believe the Accused that he kissed the victim with her consent impliedly or expressly.

24     The Accused knew that he was to take the victim home at Potong Pasir. However, he took her to the quiet carpark at Concorde Mall/hotel. He was unable to provide a reasonable reason as to why he drove her to the carpark rather than sending her home at Potong Pasir. His reason that he did not know where to park besides the basement of Concorde Mall/hotel was clearly a lie. He has been a private limousine driver for more than 2 years. Surely, he would know there were many open carpark to park his car. In my view, he chose this basement car park as it was a deserted car park on that day which was an early Sunday morning to facilitate the commission of the offences.

25     I found the Accused's evidence given in court were inconsistent with his police statements. The reason the Accused gave in court for driving the victim to the carpark at Concorde Mall/hotel was inconsistent with his police statement recorded on 10 December 2017 at 9:15am, Concorde Hotel. See P6/P6A. Both exhibits P6 and P6A were the same. P6 was in handwritten form and P6A was the typewritten version of P6. In P6A, the Accused said he drove to the carpark at Concorde Hotel "because we were already intimate and I wanted to stop at the carpark and ask her if she wanted to book a room in the hotel…."

26     In court, the Accused said that the demeanour of the victim was normal when she responded to the Accused's question whether she needed a car. However, in P6A the Accused stated that the victim was drunk when he approached her to fetch her home.

27     The Accused agreed during cross-examination that the victim boarded the car herself and sat at the back. On the other hand, in P6A, he stated that the victim was drunk and her friends had to lift her into the car.

28     During cross-examination, the Accused agreed with the learned DPP that because the victim was tipsy that was why he asked her whether she wanted to sit in front. However, he subsequently said that he asked the victim to move in front, as it was easier to converse with her. Despite the inconsistency, the Accused persisted in saying that there was not much of a difference.

29     The Accused was confronted as to the inconsistency in P6A where he said the victim mentioned that the draught from the air-con was blowing at her and she felt cold so he reached out for her hand. On the other hand, in court, he testified that he held the victim's hand as she moved forward when the car was in motion. He claimed that he did not mention about the air-con in court, as it did not come to his mind.

30     There were also different versions given by the Accused for kissing the victim. In court, he claimed that he kissed her because she did not resist his holding on her hand. On the other hand, in P7 he said he kissed her while massaging her head.

31     The Accused was vacillating when giving evidence. "He initially stated in his own evidence that he had asked the victim and her friends if they needed a car while waiting at the pickup area, and the victim responded to his question in the affirmative. Yet, under cross-examination, he suddenly claimed it was the victim who had approached him to ask for a car first, and in the very next breath then said it was her friend who approached him." (See page 32 of the Prosecution's submission but without the footnotes).

32     The Accused was argumentative and evasive. As pointed out by the Prosecution, this was apparent in the following:

## Submission by the Defence

33     Counsel submitted that the victim was lying in her evidence. However, there were no possible reason(s) provided by the Defence that the victim might have had to concoct these allegations and falsely implicate the accused. Neither was there any sufficient evidence of any alleged motive as to raise a reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case.

34     Counsel seemed to suggest that there was consent on the part of the victim to the kissing as it was submitted that during the ride, there were opportunities for the victim to escape but she did not. With respect, this must be considered in the light of the fact that the victim was a young and venerable victim. She was a foreigner to this country. She was tired and sleepy. She admitted that she drank alcohol that night. The Accused said she was tipsy. She was also not in control of the vehicle. In such circumstances, I rejected any suggestion that because she did not attempt to escape would indicate her consent to the first kissing incident.

35     The fact that the Accused did not run away after the incident cannot be an indicator of the truthfulness or innocence on the part of the Accused. At most, it was a neutral factor as there were CCTV footages of the car and the Accused at the premises of Concorde Hotel/Mall that supported the victim’s evidence.

## My Findings

36     In the light of the inconsistencies and the Accused’s evasiveness in giving evidence, I concluded that the Accused was not a credible witness. Accordingly, I rejected his defence of bare denial to the acts of touching the victim’s breast and vagina. In this respect, I also found the Accused’s defence of implied or explicit consent on the part of the victim for the kissing was unfounded and illogical. I agreed with the Prosecution that both the Accused and the victim were strangers and could not possibly have any feelings to each other during the short car ride. “In the context of a driver-passenger relationship, it is also ludicrous to expect that the victim would have been welcoming of his advances when all she wanted to do was to go home. The accused simply assumed the victim was receptive when her behaviour did not fit into the stereotypical manner of refusal, and wilfully shut his eyes to the circumstances by ignoring her silence and requests to go home and telling her to wait. The accused was still in control of the car at all times, and this only deepened the victim’s sense of fear and helplessness over the course of the night as she was ultimately dependent on the accused to get home.” See Prosecution’s submission at page 23. In the context of the case, I also held that silence did not mean consent especially when the Accused agreed that when he first kissed the victim she was surprised. He even conceded that the victim did not expect to be kissed and that she did not reciprocate when the Accused kissed her. See transcripts of Day 4 at page 29.

37     I also agreed with the Prosecution that “(E)even if she had allowed him to hold her hand, because of the pretext he had given that she was swaying, this does not in of itself justify the accused’s subsequent uninvited act of kissing the victim.” I noted that the Accused and victim was of a driver-passenger relationship. In this context, it was the responsibility of the Accused as a hired driver to drive the victim to her stated destination and not to the carpark at Concorde Hotel/mall to commit the offences.

38     In respect of the kissing at the carpark of Concorde Hotel/Mall, I found no evidence that the victim was agreeable to such act. There was no evidence of consent or knowledge on the part of the victim for her to be driven to that carpark. Indeed, the Accused drove her there on his own accord. On the other hand, it was clear that she wanted to go back to her home at Potong Pasir. In fact, despite her wish to go home, the Accused took advantage of her apparent failure to reject him explicitly. The Accused not only pulled her out of her seat and pushed her to the back, he even sat on her so that it would be harder for her to get out of the car.

39     If there were consent, there was no reason for the victim to seek the help of PW2 and take refuge in the Mall’s toilet. The extent of the victim’s distress and emotional state were also not consistent with any allegation of consent on the part of the victim for the highly intrusive advances and outrageous acts done by the Accused in kissing and touching her breasts and groping her vagina area.

## Guilty and Convicted

40     In the circumstances, I was of the view that the Prosecution had proven the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the Accused was found guilty and convicted of the 3 charges.

## Antecedents

41     The Accused was untraced.

## Submission on Sentence

42     The Prosecution submitted for a global imprisonment term of at least 20 months and four strokes of the cane.

43     Based on the sentencing framework for section 354 (1) of the Penal Code laid down in _Kunasekaran s/o Kalimuthu Somasundaram v PP_ \[2018\] SGHC _9 (“Kunasekaran”)_, for MAC 901884/2018, the sentence submitted was 4 months’ imprisonment (Band 1). In respect of MAC 901885/2018, the Prosecution submitted for at least 11 months’ imprisonment and one stroke of the cane (Band2). Finally, the Prosecution submitted a sentence of at least 16 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane for MAC 901886/2018 (Band 2). The Prosecution urged the court to order the sentences in MAC 901884/2018 and MAC 901886/2018 to run consecutively.

44     The Prosecution highlighted the various offence-specific factors. First, it was submitted that the Accused abused his position as a transport provider in the commission of the offences. Secondly, there were some degree of deception and premeditation. Next, there was escalation in the degree of sexual exploitation, culminating in intrusion into the victim’s private parts. Finally, there was negative impact of the incident on the victim.

45     It was submitted that there was no offender-specific factors that warranted a significant downward calibration of the indicative sentences.

46     Counsel for the Accused did not tender a written mitigation plea. In his oral submission, counsel submitted that there was no premeditation. There was no skin-to-skin contact over the private parts. There was also proximity in time in the commission of the offences. He also highlighted that the duration of the offences was short.

47     In terms of sentencing in the context of the sentencing framework laid down in _Kunasekaran_, counsel agreed that MAC 901884/2018 fell within Band 1 category while the other two offences fell within Band 2. He submitted for a sentence of 3 months’ imprisonment for MAC 901884/2018. For MAC 901885/2018, he submitted for a sentence of 7 months’ imprisonment and in respect of the third charge (MAC 901886/2018), he submitted for a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment. He left the issue of caning to the court.

## Sentencing Considerations

48     Given the nature of the offences committed, I was of the view that the primary sentencing considerations must be one of deterrence and retribution.

49     For the respective offences committed, there was no dispute as to the sentencing band in accordance to the sentencing framework laid down in _Kunasekaran_’s _case_. I accepted this position and sentenced the Accused based on the said sentencing framework.

50     I accepted the various offence-specific factors highlighted by the Prosecution. As a transport provider, the Accused had abused the trust of his passenger. The fact that the offence was committed in the performance of this service was an aggravating factor because it interfered with the safe enjoyment of such service, which was a basic entitlement and expectation of every fare-paying passenger.

51     The fact that the Accused knew that the victim was tipsy, holding on her hand on the pretext of steadying her and driven to the basement car park without her knowledge indicated some degree of deception and premeditation. The car park was quiet as it was a Sunday, which must be a factor the Accused had in mind before driving there to commit the offences. It also fortified my finding that there was premeditation.

52     I also agreed that there was escalation in the degree of sexual exploitation, culminating in intrusion into the victim’s private parts. From a kissing whilst the car was stopping at a traffic light junction, the Accused proceeded to a car park where he again kissed and progressed to squeezing the breast and touching the victim’s private parts. In this respect, I was of the view that the degree of sexual exploitation was high in relation to MAC 901886/2018 where there was intrusion on the victim’s private parts albeit over her clothing.

53     I was also of the view that the victim must have been traumatised by the incident as seen in her demeanour immediately after the incident. She also showed up in court on the first day of trial wearing a mask. The victim had also testified that she now avoided taking vehicles that resembled the Accused’s car.

54     Next, the Accused had not shown any remorsefulness. Instead, the Accused had subjected the victim to further trauma and humiliation by having to recount the incident in open court.

55     In assessing the sentence to be passed, I also took into consideration the offence (MAC 903165/2018) that the Accused admitted and consented for it to be taken into account for the purpose of sentence. This TIC charge, which involved another female, was of the similar nature as the present offences. “_Prima facie_, this elevates his culpability and engages the need for specific deterrence” per Justice See Kee Oon in _PP v S Elamparithi_ (unreported MA 9238 of 2019) at \[15\]. This TIC offence took place after the Accused had committed the present offences and 3 days before he was charged in court. An uplift in the sentence was therefore warranted. See also _PP v UI_ \[2008\] 4 SLR (R) 500 at \[38\]-\[39\].

56     The exploitation of the vulnerability of a sleeping victim was also an aggravating factor. See _GCO v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 1402</span> at \[41\]. In this case, the victim was in and out of her sleep and was taken advantage of during her slumber, which resulted in the charge numbered as MAC 901884/2018. I also noted that the victim was tipsy.

57     I noted that the Accused had no known antecedents. There was also no skin-to-skin contact other than the kissing. With due respect, I cannot agree that the duration of the offences was short. The first offence was committed very shortly after the ride. The Accused then drove the victim to the basement carpark at Concorde Hotel to commit the other 2 offences.

## Conclusion

58     In assessing the sentence to be meted out, I also took into account the prescribed punishment for the offences committed.

59     Based on the sentencing considerations above, the Accused was sentenced to 3 months’ imprisonment for MAC 901884/2018 which did not involve the victim’s private parts. He was sentenced to 10 months’ imprisonment in respect of MAC 901885/2018 and 15 months’ imprisonment 3 strokes for MAC 901886/2018. The sentences were also in line with the precedents cited by the Prosecution.

60     The sentences in MAC 901884/2018 and MAC 901886/2018 were ordered to run consecutively. Hence, the total sentence was 18 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane. In my view, the global sentence was not disproportionately severe or crushing. In this respect, I noted that the maximum sentence prescribed for the offence is a jail term of 2 years and may be caned up to six stokes. I also noted that in _Balasubramaniam Palaniappa Vaiyapuri v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 SLR(R) 138</span>, the High Court sentenced the Accused to 24 months’ imprisonment on one charge under section 354 Penal Code, for touching the breast of a flight stewardess.

61     The Accused is currently on bail.
