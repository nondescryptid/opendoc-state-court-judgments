Civil procedure – Experts

24 May 2019

### Deputy Registrar Chiah Kok Khun:

## Introduction

1       This is the Defendant’s application to disqualify a single joint expert (“SJE”) appointed under Order 108 Rule 5(3) of the Rules of Court. The SJE in this case is a medical expert appointed in respect of the Plaintiff’s claim for personal injuries suffered as a result of a road traffic accident on 8 September 2016. The accident involved taxi No. SHB 5101T driven by the Plaintiff and motorcar No. SGU 4225Z driven by the Defendant.[^1] The Plaintiff claims that he suffered a whiplash injury. Interlocutory judgment in default of appearance was entered against the Defendant on 22 January 2018.[^2] The matter is to proceed for assessment of damages. The Defendant’s insurers appointed solicitors to act in the assessment of damages.[^3]

2       On 10 May 2018, the court appointed Dr William Verhoeven (“Dr Verhoeven”) an orthopaedic specialist, as the SJE the assessment of damages. The appointment was made after parties could not agree as to who was to be appointed the SJE. In making the appointment, the court considered affidavits filed on behalf of the parties setting out the respective parties’ nomination of candidates for appointment as the SJE and related information in respect of the candidates. Such affidavits are commonly known as “SJE affidavits” in the State Courts. The directions for the filing and exchange of the SJE affidavits in this case were given on 12 April 2018. I will elaborate on the nature of SJE affidavits below.

3       On 8 November 2018, the Defendant took out the present application to disqualify Dr Verhoeven as the SJE and replace him with Dr W.C. Chang. The ground of the Defendant’s application in gist is that Dr Verhoeven lacks independence, and has demonstrated partiality and bias towards the Plaintiff.[^4]

## The Simplified Process for Small Value Civil Claims

4       As this is the first written decision relating to the appointment of SJE, I will first set out the backdrop to the concept of SJE. SJE is one of the features of a civil process implemented on 1 November 2014. This is the process that governs all Magistrate Courts’ cases (“MC cases”) filed on or after the date of implementation. Under this process, civil procedure for MC cases is simplified. It is in essence a simplified process for small value civil cases (“Simplified Process”). As SJE is an integral part of the Simplified Process, it is useful to first briefly revisit the rationale, underlying principles and key features of the Simplified Process. It will give the necessary context to the concept of SJE, as SJE exists under the auspices of the Simplified Process.

5       As alluded to above, the Simplified Process was implemented on 1 November 2014. A new Order in the Rules of Court (“ROC”), Order 108 was introduced to govern the Simplified Process.[^5] The genesis of the Simplified Process can be traced to the Opening of the Legal Year 2013 (“OLY 2013”). In his address at OLY 2013, the Honourable the Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon directed the then Subordinate Courts to “_seek further ways to reduce the cost of litigating \[small value civil cases\], with greater emphasis on consensual outcomes, and, failing that, by developing simpler and faster processes”.[^6]_ A working group, chaired by then Chief District Judge and comprising experienced practitioners and district judges of the State Courts, reviewed the existing processes and formulated the Simplified Process after consulting the Law Society.

6       I will now discuss the rationale for the Simplified Process. Understanding the rationale will in turn lead to a better appreciation of the governing principles of the Simplified Process.

### Rationale and Governing Principle of the Simplified Process

7       Prior to 1 November 2014, the ROC prescribed a single regime for all cases that come into our courts, with the process geared towards bringing a case to trial. We had one set of procedural rules that governed cases of all values. All cases, regardless of value or nature, were subject to the same process. Further, the rules assumed every case would go to trial. In fact, the very purpose of the rules was to prepare parties for trial.[^7]

8       It is however well known that a large number of MC cases do not go to trial. Many of them eventually settle, and some, after all preparations for trial have been made. For MC cases filed before 1 November 2014, such preparations were conducted in accordance with the full extent of the procedural rules under the ROC. This translated to a significant wastage of resources often disproportionate to the value of the claim. To apply the full rigour of the procedural rules to MC cases was just not proportionate. At the same time, the rules were not tailored for how the majority of MC cases were eventually disposed of. The rules operated on the assumption they were going for trial, but these cases were not headed for a trial.

9       The implication was obvious. A simpler procedure was needed for small value claims.[^8] Further, the procedure should gear parties towards early resolution of the dispute. There was clearly a need to rethink the process for MC cases to reflect the principle of proportionality, with upfront disclosure and early negotiation to facilitate a resolution without trial. A new process was needed and the process had to be differentiated for small value claims; focused on consensual outcomes; be quicker; and simpler.

10     The governing principle of the Simplified Process is therefore proportionality. The considerations of proportionality in turn imply that simplicity of procedure is necessary for MC cases.

### Key Features of the Simplified Process

11     Next, I will briefly recap the key elements of the Simplified Process. The Simplified Process features upfront disclosure of documents together with early and robust case management. The primary aim is to facilitate early resolution of the dispute. Interlocutory applications are curtailed. Alternative dispute resolution (“ADR”) is employed where appropriate. For cases that require adjudication, the trial is simplified.

12     The five key features of the Simplified Process are as follows:[^9]

a.     Upfront disclosure;

b.     Early and robust case management;

c.     The use of ADR;

d.     Curtailed interlocutories; and

e.     Simplified trial.

13     The first feature is upfront disclosure. Under the Simplified Process, parties file and serve a list of documents with their pleadings. Thus at the outset, all documentary evidence in relation to the dispute is disclosed. The purpose of upfront disclosure is to enable parties to have a better sense of the relative strengths and weaknesses of their cases at an early stage. The weighing of the relative strengths and weaknesses facilitates early appreciation of the situation and deliberation of available options to move forward.

14     The next feature is early and robust case management, in the form of the case management conference (“CMC”). The CMC is at the heart of the Simplified Process. A CMC is called early in the life cycle of a case, about 50 days after the Defence is filed. At the CMC the court helps parties identify and narrow issues; and deals with all interlocutory matters. The objective is to prevent expansion of issues and manage interlocutory warfare. In doing so, the court aims to de-escalate the conflict and close the gap between the parties.

15     Lawyers are expected to come prepared for the CMC. Proposals are to be exchanged before the CMC.[^10] A list of issues and a list of witnesses are to be filed and served before the first CMC.[^11] The court discusses with parties at the CMC the strengths and the weaknesses of the respective sides. With the documentary evidence and the lists of witnesses already disclosed, both sides are encouraged to confront the realities of their own cases. The court assists by giving an evaluation of the merits of the case. This is the robust aspect of the CMC. The court’s purpose of giving its view on the merits of the case is solely to guide parties on negotiations toward possible resolution of the case. Where necessary, the court suggests possible ways to settle the case, including broad terms of settlement. In the experience of the State Courts in conducting CMC, the quickest and most cost-effective mode of resolving a case without a trial is for parties to negotiate directly with each other; and where parties are represented, through their counsel. Such direct negotiation is facilitated by the robust case management conducted by the court at CMC.

16     The CMC is docketed, with the same judge conducting three sessions of about an hour each for the case. If the case is not resolved, all necessary directions would be given at the CMC for the progress of the case. One of the directions given at CMC could be referrals to ADR. Encouraging resort to ADR is the next feature of the simplified process. The court welcomes all types of ADR. Where it is felt that a dedicated, half-day mediation session might help parties to settle, the case would be referred for court dispute resolution (“CDR”) at the State Courts Dispute Resolution Centre.[^12] CDR is, however, by no means the only form of ADR. In some cases, parties prefer to have their disputes mediated at the Singapore Mediation Centre. Increasingly, parties are also referring their cases to Law Society’s mediation scheme for resolution. In other cases, parties refer their dispute to a mutually acceptable third party for resolution. These various forms of ADR are encouraged. The court facilitates a multi-door approach to dispute resolution and supports all alternatives to litigation. Where parties refer their cases for resolution by ADR processes, the CMC would be adjourned for an appropriate period to allow these ADR processes to take their course.

17     The next feature of the Simplified Process is curtailed interlocutories. As discussed above, the court manages all interlocutory matters at the CMC. Issues relating to the disclosure of documents in the list of documents are also dealt with at the CMC. The court hears the parties and directs the disclosure of any relevant documents omitted in the list of documents. Applications for specific discovery[^13] are therefore not necessary and are disallowed. Interrogatories, the utility value of which is far out-weighed by the efforts the process involves, are also not allowed.[^14] Other interlocutory applications are dealt with in a summary manner at the CMC, without the need to file summonses and affidavits. As for summary judgment applications, which tends to be drawn out by parties through sequential filing of affidavits, they are not allowed under the Simplified Process. Where a defendant persists with a clearly unmeritorious defence, in appropriate cases, the court strikes out the defence at the CMC. In other cases, the court directs an expedited simplified trial.

18     If the case is not resolved, all necessary directions are given at the CMC for the further progress of the case. If the case has to proceed to trial, directions are given at the CMC for a simplified trial. It is at the CMC that directions for SJE are given, in cases where expert evidence is involved. The simplified trial is another feature of the Simplified Process. Simplified trials are conducted with limited time allocated for the different stages of the trial as follows:

a.     Evidence in chief (to introduce the AEIC of each witness) – 10 mins.

b.     Cross-examination (each witness) – 60 mins.

c.     Re-examination (each witness) – 10 mins.

d.     Closing submissions (each party) – 30 mins.

19     The narrowing of issues at the CMC makes a simplified trial practicable. The narrowing of issues also facilitates the appointment of an SJE. This will be elaborated on below.

20     A significant number of MC cases involve claims for personal injuries and property damage arising from motor accidents (“PIPD cases”). The pre-action protocols for PIPD cases continue to apply. These cases are routed for CDR at an early stage under the protocols. Likewise, claims for personal injuries resulting from industrial accidents and medical negligence proceed directly to CDR under pre-action protocols. As such, CMCs are not held for these cases. If a case is not settled, directions are given for a simplified trial. These directions include those for the appointment of SJE.

## The Concept of SJE

21     It would be seen from above that the underlying philosophy of the Simplified Process is simplicity in procedure. This simplicity in procedure is reiterated in the mandatory use of SJE when parties wish to introduce expert evidence at the trial/assessment of damages/hearing. The notion of SJE is new to our jurisdiction, having been introduced for the first time with the advent of Order 108 in November 2014. It is also much misunderstood. I shall therefore next discuss the concept of SJE, before I move on to the question of selection of SJE.

22     The appointment of SJE is provided for under Order 108 Rule 5 of the ROC:

_“Order 108 Rule 5_

(_3_)     _If any question requiring the evidence of an expert witness arises in any case which the Court has directed to be set down for a simplified trial –_

(_a_)     _the parties must jointly appoint one independent expert to give the expert evidence in a written report; and_

(_b_)     _if the parties are unable to agree on the expert to be appointed –_

(_i_)     _the Court shall –_

(_A_)     _make such orders or give such directions, in relation to the appointment of the expert, as the Court deems fit, including an order appointing the expert; and_

(_B_)     _fix the amount of remuneration payable to the expert; and_

(_ii_)    _the parties shall be jointly and severally liable to pay the expert the amount of remuneration fixed by the Court._

_…_

(_7_)     _In every case to which this Order applies, where interlocutory judgment has been entered for damages to be assessed, this Rule shall apply with the necessary modifications to the assessment of damages.”_

23     As seen, Order 108 Rule 5(3) provides that parties must jointly appoint an independent expert to give expert evidence in a written report. For each specified field of expertise, only one expert will appear and one report will be adduced at the relevant trial/assessment of damages/hearing with no other reports from any other experts in the same field on the same subject matter being admitted. Where parties cannot agree on the expert to be appointed, the court is empowered to make an order appointing the expert. The rationale is plain. With a small value claim, it is disproportionate to have two experts, one for each party, to render opinion on the same issue. Two reports would have to be prepared, and each subject to cross-examination by the other party. The experts are often presented with the facts of the case framed according to the perspective and instructions of the party appointing them. Moreover, opposing experts tend to take polarised positions on the issue at hand. The parties and the court have to traverse two differing and often competing opinions. The consequence is increased expenditure of time and effort. The concept of SJE sits eminently well with the underlying philosophy of the Simplified Process. At the end of the day, the small value involved in MC cases brings into sharp focus the question of costs proportionality in the appointment of experts. By nature, expert evidence is costly. This cost is ultimately borne by the parties. The costs savings for parties in using an SJE is a factor that cannot be easily ignored. Further, the use of SJE also fits naturally into the scheme of the simplified trial procedure.[^15]

24     It should be noted that the SJE appointed, whether by agreement of the parties or by order of the court, is an Order 40A expert. The SJE is as such a parties’ expert; and not a court-appointed expert within the meaning of Order 40 of the ROC. The SJE is not a court-appointed expert even if the SJE is appointed by order of court. The appointment by order of court is in default of the parties’ agreement on the expert to appoint. The SJE remains a parties’ expert. As a parties’ expert, the SJE serves the primary function of explaining “words, or terms of science or art appearing on the documents which have to be construed by the court, to give expert assistance to the court (e.g. as to the laws of science, or the working of a technical process or system) or to inform the court as to the state of public knowledge with regard to the matters before it”.[^16] Instructions to the SJE are given jointly. The SJE is also under a duty to assist the court on the matters within his expertise, with such duty overriding any obligation to the parties from whom he receives instructions or by whom he is paid. Further, as a parties’ expert, the SJE is open to cross-examination by parties as of right.

25     However, unlike an expert who is instructed by one party in proceedings under Order 40A of the ROC, an SJE is appointed by parties or the court to provide evidence which will be relied on and referred to _jointly_ by both parties in the case. As such:

a.     An SJE’s evidence is expected to be independent of the cases of each of the parties in the matter;

b.     An SJE’s fees and costs of engagement are borne equally between parties before being finally determined;

c.     Prior to the issuance of the SJE’s report, both parties are entitled to and are encouraged to provide the SJE with a list of queries or issues which they will be raising at the trial, assessment of damages or hearing for the relevant proceedings to ensure that all relevant evidence will be before the court at the appropriate juncture;

d.     As alluded to above, for each specified field of expertise, only one SJE will appear and one report will be adduced at the relevant trial/assessment of damages/hearing with no other reports from any other experts in the same field on the same subject matter being admitted;

e.     Parties to a suit are not bound by the contents of the SJE’s report and the appointment of an SJE is without prejudice to either party’s right to cross-examine the SJE on his relevant area of expertise and/or his report. The Court has the discretion to decide which party cross-examines first. Order 108 Rule 5(5)(b) provides that the time limit for cross examination of a witness in a simplified trial is 60 minutes per witness. Order 108 Rule 5(6), however, provides that the court may extend any time limit as it deems fit; and

f.     As mentioned above, the fees of the SJE are to be borne equally by the parties in the first instance, but can be recovered by the successful party at the conclusion of the trial/assessment of damages/hearing as disbursements.

26     It should be noted that parties are not precluded from applying to have their own experts examine the subject matter of the dispute. In some cases, it may be necessary for parties to have recourse to their own experts in order to be in a position to examine the SJE and the contents of his/her report. In a personal injury case for example, an application for the plaintiff to be re-examined by another medical specialist (beside the SJE) for the purpose of preparation for cross examination would therefore be allowed. It must however, be noted that the report of this other medical specialist will not be admitted at the hearing and that he or she cannot be called as an expert witness. At the end of the day, the principle is that there can be only one expert giving evidence (on each expert issue) at the hearing under the Simplified Process.

27     Further, under certain circumstances, an expert might be called by a party as a factual witness, whilst an SJE would be called to give expert evidence. This could happen for instance (using a personal injury case for illustration again) where the Accident & Emergency (“A&E”) doctor who first attended to the patient did not record a particular injury and there is a dispute over whether the injuries claimed existed at the time of the accident. A party may then apply to have the A&E doctor called, as a factual witness to confirm whether the injury was overlooked and undocumented or did not exist. Such a witness is a factual witness and no evidence or questions relating to his or her opinion of the injury or to matters properly covered by the SJE’s report would be admitted or allowed.

## Framework for Appointment of SJE by Order of Court

28     I turn now to the question of the selection of SJE. Where parties cannot agree on the expert to be appointed as the SJE, the court is empowered under Order 108 Rule 5(3)(b)(1)(A) to make an order appointing the SJE. The appointment of an SJE is entirely within the discretion of the court, taking into consideration all the circumstances of the case. The court will appoint the expert who is in the best position to assist the court at the trial, hearing or assessment of damages on the facts of the relevant case.

29     I will now discuss the approach adopted by the court and the general guidelines used in the exercise of the court’s discretion. This can be viewed as a framework for the appointment of SJE by order of court. It should however be noted that the framework is strictly for purposes of providing guidance and reference. It is not to be taken as exhaustive.

30     The process of appointment of SJE by the court begins with the parties proposing their nominees for SJE. The court considers the parties’ nominees to determine their suitability for appointment. To facilitate the process of determination, parties may be directed to furnish, by way of affidavit, names of two experts each, their curriculum vitae, together with their expected fees (both for preparing the report as well as attendance at the hearing) and the estimated time needed by each to prepare the report. These affidavits are commonly known as “SJE affidavits”. The court would generally hear brief submissions from parties on the suitability or otherwise of the nominees, before selecting one of the four nominated candidates as SJE.

31     In deciding on the expert to be appointed as SJE, the court looks at a few key factors. These factors include the following:

a.     Area of expertise and experience of the proposed expert;

b.     Costs of a proposed expert’s engagement including the costs of examination, surveys, reviewing documents, preparing reports, giving clarifications and/or attending the trial/hearing;

c.     Length of time required for a proposed expert to produce his/her report;

d.     In personal injury cases arising from motor accidents (“PIMA cases”), whether the proposed expert is from a restructured hospital, is the treating physician and/or had the opportunity to evaluate the patient or relevant medical records at the appropriate juncture in order to reach a considered expert opinion;

e.     In non-injury motor accident cases (“NIMA cases”), whether the proposed expert had conducted a pre-repair and/or post-repair inspection of the vehicle;

f.     Whether either party had breached any of the regulations within the NIMA or PIMA pre-action protocols which led to circumstances affecting the position of either party with respect to the appointment of an SJE (e.g. failure to inform the Defendant of the accident within the prescribed timeline leading to the Defendant losing the opportunity to conduct pre-repair inspection). In this regard, the SJE affidavit should also state whether the parties have complied with pre-action protocols; and/or

g.     Allegations in respect of claim inflation, causation, fraud and/or bias.

32     The court looks at the above factors and considers all of them in deciding which expert to appoint as SJE. In NIMA and PIMA cases, the use of pre-action protocols has worked well for many years to assist parties to reach early resolution and to limit the scope of the dispute. The pre-action protocols also assist in the process of preserving evidence in regard to the nature and extent of property damage or personal injury. In particular, the pre-action protocols contain provisions in respect of inspection of damage caused to motor vehicles that would form the subject matter of NIMA claims. These pre-action protocols therefore relate to the questions that expert evidence seeks to address in such cases. Compliance with them are directly connected to the issue of expert evidence and the court values the compliance by parties with these pre-action protocols. To this end, non-compliance with pre-action protocols by a party will in general result in the preference of the court to appoint the complying party’s nominated expert. The other factor considered in NIMA and PIMA cases is the scope and tendency for claims to be inflated; and relatedly, bias and fraud. To the extent that this factor is credibly triggered in a given case, the claimant’s nominations will be looked upon less favourably by the court.

33     In the event that none of the experts nominated by parties is deemed suitable by the court, the court will appoint an SJE not nominated by either party.

34     The above framework ensues from the concept of SJE discussed earlier. The SJE is ultimately a parties’ expert. The governing principles of the Simplified Process mandates the use of one expert for each expert issue instead of the customary one expert for each party for each expert issue. As the said one expert remains a parties’ expert, the preference is for parties to agree on the expert to be appointed; and parties are encouraged to do so. By the same token, in the event that parties are unable to agree, the inclination is for the court to select one of the parties’ nominated experts as SJE. It is only when none of the parties’ nominated experts is deemed suitable, that the court will appoint an expert not nominated by either party.

## The Appointment of SJE in this Case

### The Defendant’s contentions

35     I return to the application in question in this case. To re-cap, the Defendant took out the present application to disqualify and replace the SJE appointed by the court with an expert nominated by the Defendant. The ground of the Defendant’s application in gist is that the SJE appointed, Dr Verhoeven lacks independence, and has demonstrated partiality and bias towards the Plaintiff.[^17]

36     Verhoeven was appointed by the court under the process discussed above. He was among the nominees put up by the respective parties for consideration of the court, after parties failed to agree on the SJE. Dr Verhoeven was the Plaintiff’s nominee and had already seen the Plaintiff on 13 September 2017. He issued a specialist medical report dated 20 September 2017 in support of the Plaintiff’s claim before he was appointed the SJE. Dr Verhoeven was appointed the SJE by the court on 10 May 2018, after the court had heard arguments for and against his appointment. Following his appointment as the SJE, Dr Verhoeven produced an SJE report dated 13 June 2018, in compliance with the Court's directions given at the hearing on 10 May 2018. In the SJE report, Dr Verhoeven stated his view that the injuries sustained by the Plaintiff in his previous road traffic accidents of 11 May 2010, 20 May 2010, 8 December 2010 and 23 May 2016 would have had no (or a negligible) impact on the injuries suffered as a result of the accident of 8 September 2016, which is the accident that gave rise to this case.![]([2019] SGMC 0024_Image/[2019] SGMC 0024_image1.jpeg)

37     The Defendant emphasised that Dr Verhoeven did not produce any contemporaneous clinical notes or state in the SJE report whether the Plaintiff had related his accident history to him during the consultation of 13 September 2017. Dr Verhoeven stated in the SJE report that he did not have any knowledge of the Plaintiff’s previous accidents when he prepared his initial specialist medical report dated 20 September 2017 in support of the Plaintiff’s claim.

38     On 27 August 2018, the Defendant's solicitors received photographs in respect of the most recent prior accident the Plaintiff was involved in on 23 May 2016. The Defendant’s solicitors say that the photographs showed significant damage to the Plaintiff’s taxi no. SHB 105T sustained in that accident. The damage caused to the Plaintiff’s taxi as a result of the 23 May 2016 accident appeared to be more severe than the damage caused in the 8 September 2016 accident (the accident that gave rise to this case). The Defendant's solicitors forwarded copies of the damage photographs to Dr Verhoeven and sought his clarification as to whether the Plaintiff’s injuries seen after the accident of 8 September 2016 could have been attributable to the accident of 23 May 2016.

39     In response, Dr Verhoeven immediately arranged for an appointment for the Plaintiff to attend at his clinic on 3 September 2018. In fact, Dr Verhoeven had already at that time fixed a follow-up appointment for the Plaintiff to see him for purposes of the SJE report. So effectively, Dr Verhoeven was bringing forward the Plaintiff’s follow-up medical appointment. As I will discuss below however, the Defendant’s solicitors take issue with the fact that Dr Verhoeven did not inform or seek the consent of the Defendant before bringing forward the medical appointment.

40     After the medical appointment, Dr Verhoeven submitted a “clarification SJE report” ("Clarification Report") dated 4 September 2018. The Defendant’s solicitors say that it was only upon receipt of the Clarification Report that they realised that Dr Verhoeven had taken it upon himself to call the Plaintiff for an appointment. The Defendant’s solicitors say that the Clarification Report contained detailed, self-serving statements by the Plaintiff that injuries sustained by him in the accident of 23 May 2016 had resolved as of 8 September 2016. The Defendant’s solicitors highlight that Dr Verhoeven in turn relied on these statements to support the medical opinion that the Plaintiff’s injuries and disabilities are attributed to the 8 September 2016 accident.

41     The main ground of the Defendant’s application to disqualify Dr Verhoeven as the SJE however, is that by arranging for the appointment with the Plaintiff without parties’ consent, Dr Verhoeven has demonstrated partiality towards the Plaintiff amounting to bias in contravention of the standards expected of experts. The Defendant’s solicitors protest that that Dr Verhoeven has “_entered into the fray of these proceedings_” by “_extracting information from the Plaintiff to pass off as his own clarification_” to support his expert evidence.[^18]![]([2019] SGMC 0024_Image/[2019] SGMC 0024_image2.jpeg)They say that Dr Verhoeven had obtained details from the Plaintiff pertaining to the prior accident of 23 May 2016, which he was initially not privy to.[^19]

42     The Defendant’s solicitors further express their disagreement with the opinion of Dr Verhoeven that the more severe injury sustained on 23 May 2016 had resolved by the time of the subsequent accident on 8 September 2016. In this regard, the Defendant’s solicitors make reference to “_objective damage photographs of the Plaintiff's taxi_”.[^20] The Defendant’s solicitors assert that Dr Verhoeven's reasoning and basis for his medical opinion and diagnosis is clearly founded on the Plaintiff’s self-serving and afterthought statements which were given more than two years after the accident. The Defendant’s solicitors criticise Dr Verhoeven’s expert opinion for failing to “_place much significance on the consistency between the Plaintiffs subjective symptoms arising out of both accidents, the respective diagnoses given by the treating doctors, and the objective damage photographs to the Plaintiff's taxi_”.[^21]

43     In short, beside the contention that Dr Verhoeven has demonstrated partiality towards the Plaintiff by arranging an appointment with the Plaintiff without parties’ consent, the Defendant’s solicitors simply disagree with Dr Verhoeven’s expert opinion.

### Analysis

44     At the outset, I am unable to see how an SJE can be said to be biased just because he had arranged for the Plaintiff to attend at his clinic for a further consultation without seeking the consent of the Defendant. It simply does not follow. The Defendant has not referred to any basis for this assertion. There is also no suggestion that there is any medical protocol prohibiting a doctor in this scenario to arrange for a patient to attend at his clinic and be further examined.

45     To re-cap, Dr Verhoeven was appointed the SJE by the court on 10 May 2018, after the court had an opportunity to peruse the SJE affidavits and to hear arguments for and against his appointment. After Dr Verhoeven produced the SJE report dated 13 June 2018, the Defendant's solicitors had written to him on 27August 2018 seeking clarification of the SJE report. Dr Verhoeven then immediately brought forward the Plaintiff's follow-up appointment to 3September 2018, and examined the Plaintiff. In fact, Dr Verhoeven had acted only in response to the Defendant's request for clarification. The Defendant’s solicitors appear to be saying that Dr Verhoeven ought to have first obtained the Defendant’s consent before doing so. I fail to see any merit in this proposition. The Defendant’s solicitors have not suggested any reason why the SJE ought to have first obtained the Defendant’s consent, which seems to me would have served no purpose at all.

46     As for the Defendant’s generalised assertions of bias against Dr Verhoeven, they plainly arise from the Defendant’s disagreement with Dr Verhoeven’s conclusions in the SJE report; and the reasons for reaching his conclusions. As I have noted above, the Defendant’s solicitors simply disagree with Dr Verhoeven’s expert opinion. However, that the Defendant’s solicitors disagree with the SJE’s opinion does not render the SJE biased. The Defendant’s solicitors are obviously entitled to disagree with the SJE, and will be given full opportunity at the assessment of damages to test the SJE’s opinion, including the basis for his opinion. In so doing, it is open to the Defendant’s solicitors to demonstrate the alleged bias of Dr Verhoeven. As discussed above, the SJE is subject to cross-examination by parties as of right. To the extent that the Defendant’s solicitors are able to show bias at the assessment of damages, that submission could be made to the court. The court could then make the appropriate finding. Until then, assertions of bias are unhelpful.

47     In this regard, the case authority referred to me by the Defendant’s solicitors is illustrative. The Defendant’s solicitors relied extensively on _Vita Health Laboratories Pte Ltd v Pang Seng Menq_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGHC 158</span> (“_Vita Health_“) in the submissions before me in support of the assertions of bias. However, _Vita Health_ is a decision of the High Court after the full trial. The court there was able to make findings of fact of alleged bias after the evidence was heard. In present case, the hearing of the assessment of damages has not taken place and the court has not heard the parties nor the SJE. Neither the parties nor the SJE has given evidence.

48     Until that hearing, there is no good reason for the court to find that the SJE is biased. Any bias is a matter for the court to determine after the hearing. There is simply no basis at this juncture for the court to find biasness and appoint an expert nominated by the Defendant to replace Dr Verhoeven. The Defendant’s application to disqualify and replace the SJE appointed by the court is grounded on the alleged bias of the SJE. In the circumstances, the Defendant’s application fails.

## Conclusion

49     The question of the appointment of an SJE is to be approached in the context of the Simplified Process. The governing principle of the Simplified Process is proportionality. To that end, the Simplified Process installed a judge-led and simplified procedure. The use of SJE is part of the simplified procedure.

50     Reiteration of the concept of SJE is found in the draft of the new ROC (“draft new ROC”). The draft new ROC refers to the use of one common expert by parties.[^22] It is further provided in the draft new ROC that a party is not to rely on expert evidence from more than one expert on all or any of the issues.[^23] Whilst the nomenclature differs, the common expert referred to in the draft new ROC is quintessentially an SJE.[^24]

51     The SJE is a parties’ expert and appointment of the SJE is by agreement of parties. It is only when parties are unable to agree, that the court will appoint the SJE. In the exercise of its discretion to select the expert to appoint as SJE, the court is guided by the framework as discussed above.

52     In the present case, the parties were unable to agree on the SJE. The court appointed an SJE in the exercise of its discretion after having heard parties and considered the SJE affidavits filed. The hearing for which the SJE was appointed has not taken place. The Defendant seeks, before that hearing, to disqualify the SJE so appointed on the ground that he lacks independence, and has demonstrated partiality and bias towards the Plaintiff. There is however no basis for making such a finding at this stage. The Defendant’s application is hereby dismissed. Costs of the application is to be paid by the Defendant to the Plaintiff, the quantum of which is to be agreed; failing which, it is to be fixed by me.

[^7]: I have previously written on the rationale and key features of the Simplified Process: see “A Primer on the Simplified Civil Process for Magistrate’s Court Cases”, _Singapore Law Gazette_ (April 2016) at 23.

[^8]: In UK, smaller civil cases are allocated into specialised case management tracks. The Small Claims Track deals with most claims under £10,000; and claims between £10,000 to £25,000 are allocated to the Fast Track. Cases allocated to these tracks are closely managed by the court. Normally only one expert witness is allowed and if the parties are not able to agree on an expert, the court has the power to appoint one. It is also interesting to note that costs for the advocate at the trial of such cases is fixed.

[^9]: Part III of the State Courts Practice Directions provides detailed guidelines for the procedure under the Simplified Process.

[^10]: Parties are to exchange proposals via serving Form 2 on each other. Form 2 is not to be filed as it may contain without prejudice offers to settle.

[^11]: The list of issues and the list of witnesses are filed and served under Form 3 of the State Courts Practice Directions.

[^12]: Parties are required to file Form 7 of the State Courts Practice Directions, commonly known as the ADR form before the first CMC. Parties are to state their preferred mode of ADR in the form; and in the event that any party opts out of ADR altogether, the reason for so opting out.

[^13]: Under Order 24 of the ROC. It is noted that under the draft New Rules, the proposal is for the scope of discovery to be limited such that any request for discovery on the basis of train of inquiry is disallowed. Parties are expected to proceed on the basis of the strength of their own case and not on the weakness of the opponent’s case.

[^14]: Interrogatories (under Order 26 of ROC) is likewise abolished under the draft New Rules.

[^15]: A similar approach is observed in the UK. In smaller civil cases allocated to the Small Claims Track and the Fast Track, normally only one expert witness is allowed. If the parties are not able to agree on an expert, the court has the power to appoint one.

[^24]: See _Recommendations of the Civil Justice Review Committee and Civil Justice Commission_, 26 October 2018, at \[88\], where it is noted as follows:_“There are difficulties with the current system which sees each party appointing its own expert witnesses, these being: a. The expert witnesses often have irreconcilable differences in opinion. Their evidence may then unnecessarily complicate the issues before the court, thus becoming counterproductive rather than helpful to the adjudicative process. b. Party-appointed experts are presented with the facts of the case framed according to the perspective of the party hiring them, which may influence their interpretation of the evidence. c. The disproportionately high costs usually incurred in the preparation and presentation of expert testimony.”_
