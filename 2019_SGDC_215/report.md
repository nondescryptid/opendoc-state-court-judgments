### District Judge Hamidah Bte Ibrahim:

Yusoff Bin Mohamed, a 54 year old male, was convicted after a trial, of 1 charge of consuming, on or before 4 June 2018, monoacetylmorphine, a specified drug, under Section 8(b)(ii) punishable under Section 33A(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA), Chapter 185. The charge is commonly referred to as a “Long Term Imprisonment 2” (LT2) charge as he had previously been convicted of a similar offence of consumption of morphine, a “Long Term Imprisonment 1” (LT1) charge, on 19 June 2012 under Section 33A(1) of the MDA.

2       I sentenced accused to serve the mandatory minimum sentence of 7 years imprisonment. He is now appealing only against his conviction.

## The Prosecution’s case

3       The prosecution led evidence from 6 Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) Officers and 2 analysts from the Health Sciences Authority (HSA).

#### Circumstances of Arrest

4       On the 4 of June 2018, a party of CNB officers went to the accused’s residence at Blk 519, Bedok North Avenue 1, #XXX, to look for him and he was arrested on suspicion of consumption of a specified drug. The accused was brought to Bedok Police Division and Sgt Nur Shahirah binte Abdul Jalil, PW1, lodged the arrest report, P1.

#### The procurement of the Urine Samples

5       At the said police Division, SSSgt Muhammad Haziq bin Hassan, (SSgt Haziq), PW3, was assigned to procure the urine samples of the accused. He brought him to the toilet after the accused had washed his hands and selected 3 new bottles in clear packaging, one with a red cap and 2 with blue caps. In the toilet, the accused urinated into the red-capped bottle. From this bottle, the accused poured the contents into the 2 blue-capped bottles with some remaining in the red-capped bottle. These bottles were kept separately into 2 sealed polymer bags and these bags were held by the accused at all times. The instant urine test was conducted on the urine specimen from the red-capped bottle and the result was positive for opiate. The two blue-capped bottles of urine samples were then labelled and sealed in the accused’s presence. He initialled on the labels, which had his particulars and he deposited the 2 blue-capped bottles into a locked metal container. They were sent to the HSA for analysis on the 5 of June 2018.

#### Analysis of the urine samples

6       On the 7 and 8 of June 2018 the HSA issued two certificates (P5 and P6)by 2 analysts, , namely Ms Zhang HuiFen Hannah,PW6, and Mr Chang Hian Twan, PW7, stating that each of the said urine samples contained monoacetylmorphine, a specified drug.

7       Both Ms Zhang and Mr Chang stated in their respective certificates that the presence of monoacetylmorphine is consistent with the consumption of diamorphine. They testified further that there is no prescribed medication that can give rise to the presence of monoacetylmorphine in the urine sample. Specifically consumption of codeine and the use of a Penthrox inhaler will not result in the presence of monoacetylmorphine in the urine sample.

#### The further investigation

8       The accused was released on station bail after his initial arrest. When the CNB officers received the HSA reports, they placed the accused under arrest for consumption of a specified drug. The accused surrendered an inhaler, as shown in P7, which he said might have caused the presence of monoacetylmorphine in his urine sample.

9       ASP Yang Weili (ASP Yang), PW8, the investigating officer of the case, sent the inhaler for an analysis and was informed that no controlled drug was detected in the inhaler. The accused said that he had been prescribed medication from Raffles Hospital but ASP Yang verified from the HSA list that the medication could not have resulted in the presence of monoacetylmorphine in his urine sample.

## The Defence

10     The accused in his defence testified that his urine samples tested positive for monoacetylmorphine because he had received medication from the hospital, from the clinics and from the medics he was given the inhaler. On the 1 of June 2018 he was involved in an accident and was prescribed tramadol and given codeine for treatment. In the ambulance, he was given an inhaler. He had also consumed cough medicine from Dr Wong’s clinic. He believed that because of all the medication he had tested positive for monoacetylmorphine. He denied that he had consumed diamorphine prior to his arrest. He agreed that he had nothing to say in respect of the evidence of the 2 HSA analysts.

## The Decision

11     This is a case where the 2 HSA certificates under section 16 of the MDA indicated that monoacetylmorphine, a specified drug, was found in the urine samples of the accused, which he provided on the 4 of June 2018. . His urine samples had been procured in accordance with the procedures laid out in the Regulations and the analysis of the urine samples were carried out in compliance with Section 31(4) (b) of the MDA. By virtue of the 2 HSA certificates, the presumption under section 22 of the MDA is hence triggered that the accused had consumed the said drug knowingly.

12     Ms Zhang, PW6 and Mr Chang, PW7, analysts from the HSA confirmed that the presence of the drug in question in the urine specimens of the accused was consistent with the consumption of diamorphine. The accused did not challenge their evidence. The accused is therefore presumed to have consumed the monoacetylmorphine knowingly. I applied the case of _Mohammad Ashik bin Aris v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 802</span> where the Court of Appeal held that both the actus reus and mens rea of section 8(b) of the MDA were presumed by section 22 of the MDA. The burden then shifted to the accused to rebut this presumption on a balance of probabilities.

13     The only issue therefore for determination was whether he had rebutted this presumption and this would involve an examination of his defence. Here, the accused has raised what can be classified as the medication defence. In his testimony, he claimed that a host of medication and the inhaler prescribed to him caused his urine samples to test positively for monoacetylmorphine. However, it was the unchallenged evidence of the 2 HSA analysts that no prescribed medication and the inhaler will give rise to the presence of monoacetylmorphine in his urine samples. Their 2 certificates, P5 and P6, clearly stated the presence of the monoacetylmorphine is a result of the consumption of diamorphine. The accused conceded in cross-examination that he had nothing to say to the evidence of the analysts. He had no explanation as to why his urine tested positive for monoacetylmorphine and just added that it was hard for him to explain.

14     Under these circumstances, I find that the accused has failed to rebut the presumption that he had consumed the monoacetylmorphine knowingly on a balance of probabilities. The accused’s urine samples at the material time, did, in fact, contain monoacetylmorphine, a specified drug. He was not authorised under the MDA or the Regulations thereunder to consume the said specified drug.

15     Therefore, I was more than satisfied that the prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt against the accused and I found him guilty and convicted him on the LT2 charge.

## Conclusion

16     Upon his conviction of the LT2 charge, the accused person admitted to another similar charge of LT2, committed on 13 of March 2017,(which was stood down at the commencement of the trial) to be taken into consideration for sentencing.

17     The accused is currently serving his sentence of the mandatory minimum 7 years imprisonment, which was backdated to the 23 November 2018, as he had been in remand since this date.
