### Deputy Registrar Teo Jing Lu:

## Introduction

1       The present case arose from an application by the Defendant (tenant) to strike out the entirety of the Statement of Claim filed by the Plaintiffs (landlords). At the hearing before me, the Defendant raised a host of issues with regards to the Plaintiffs’ claims. One of the key issues raised was whether the Plaintiffs have, by their continued acceptance of a monthly sum from the Defendant, waived their right of forfeiture. I considered that the question could not be answered _for now_ as it raises triable issues. The other issues raised by the Defendant regarding the Plaintiffs’ claims also merely served to bolster the conclusion that the claims should be allowed to proceed to trial. Having heard parties, I declined to strike out the Statement of Claim and dismissed the Defendant’s application. The Defendant has since filed an appeal,[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) and I now set out the full grounds of my decision.

## Background facts

2       The 1st Plaintiff (Mr Pang Kau Chai) and 2nd Plaintiff (Mdm Lau Han Sum) were at all material times the owners and landlords of the premises at 163 Upper Paya Lebar Road (“**the Premises**”). By a tenancy agreement in writing dated 1 December 2019 (“**the Tenancy Agreement**”), the Plaintiffs agreed to let to the Defendant (Runway 80 Pte Ltd) the Premises for an initial period of two years commencing from 1 December 2019 to 30 November 2021, at a monthly rent of S$5,800. At the material times, the Defendant’s representatives dealt solely with the 1st Plaintiff. The only representative of the Defendant who has filed affidavits in the present striking out application is one Ms Jolene Yew (“**Ms Yew**”).

3       During the period of the Tenancy Agreement, the Plaintiffs alleged that there were various breaches by the Defendant. This led the Plaintiffs to send a Letter of Demand & Notice of Termination dated 20 September 2021 (“**Notice of Termination**”) to the Defendant sometime on or about 22 September 2021. The allegations of breaches as stated in the Notice of Termination may be briefly summarised as follows:

> (a)     In breach of Clause 1.2 of the Tenancy Agreement, that there is an amount of S$1,600 due and payable to the Plaintiffs (being the outstanding rental due and payable, in respect of the wrongful deduction by the Defendant for the months of May 2021 and June 2021);

> (b)     In breach of Clause 2.8(a) of the Tenancy Agreement, that the Defendant has made multiple alterations and additions to the Premises without first having obtained the Plaintiffs’ consent; and

> (c)     In breach of Clause 2.30 of the Tenancy Agreement, that the Defendant has failed to take out various insurance policies during the period from 1 December 2020 to 6 July 2021.

4       By way of the Notice of Termination, the Plaintiffs sought to exercise their right to terminate the Tenancy Agreement and to re-enter and re-possess the Premises in accordance with Clause 4.1 of the Tenancy Agreement. The pertinent portions of the Notice of Termination read:

> Notice of Termination

> 5.    In view of the above wrongful deductions and/or breaches, TAKE NOTICE that our Clients exercise herein its right to terminate the Tenancy Agreement in accordance with Clause 4.1 therein. Accordingly, the Tenancy Agreement shall be terminated forthwith, and our Clients shall exercise their right to re-enter and re-possess the Premises.

> 6.    TAKE FURTHER NOTICE that our Client’s representative will be attending at the Premises on 1st October 2021. Upon such re-entry, the Tenancy Agreement shall forthwith and absolutely cease, and should you fail to remove any goods or things from the said Premises by 1st October 2021, you shall be liable for holding over under Section 28(4) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43).

5       Clause 4.1 of the Tenancy Agreement provides for the Plaintiffs’ right of entry and determination of the tenancy. For reference, Clause 4.1 of the Tenancy Agreement reads as follows:

> 4.1 Right of Entry & Determination of Tenancy

> If the rent or service charge hereby reserved shall not be paid for seven (7) days after the due date (whether formally demanded or not) or if there shall be any breach of the conditions, covenants or stipulations on the part of the Tenant herein contained, or in the event of liquidation/bankruptcy, distress or other proceedings against the Tenant then it shall be lawful for the Landlord to re-enter upon the said premises or any part thereof and thereupon this tenancy shall absolutely determine but without prejudice to any right of action of the Landlord for damage or otherwise in respect of any such breach or any antecedent breach and all legal costs incurred by the Landlord shall be payable on a full indemnity basis by the Tenant.

6       Following the Notice of Termination dated 20 September 2021, the Defendant (through their previous set of solicitors) exchanged several correspondences with the Plaintiffs’ solicitors to try to resolve the matter. On 5 November 2021, a “without prejudice” meeting was held between the Plaintiffs and the Defendant but parties did not come to any agreement or settlement. On 8 November 2021, the Defendant made a payment of S$13,200 to the Plaintiffs’ solicitors’ firm account, comprising two months’ rent for October and November 2021 plus S$1,600 for the wrongful deduction for the rental in May 2021 and June 2021. Thereafter, a few more exchanges followed but there was still no resolution between parties. The Plaintiffs commenced the present suit against the Defendant on 17 December 2021.

7       Meanwhile, a monthly sum of S$5,800 continues to be paid by the Defendant to the Plaintiffs’ solicitors’ firm account. As at the time when the striking out application was heard on 24 May 2022, the Defendant continues to occupy the Premises.

### Plaintiffs’ claims in the Statement of Claim

8       The Plaintiffs allege in their Statement of Claim (“**SOC**”) that there were various breaches of the Tenancy Agreement by the Defendant during the term of the tenancy. The particulars of the breaches in question, as well as the evidence adduced by parties in support of each alleged breach, will be explored in greater detail below when the Defendant’s striking out arguments in respect of each alleged breach are examined. For now, the breaches may be broadly categorised as follows:

> (a)     Non-payment of rent, which includes:

>> (i)       Failure to pay the full rent due from May 2021 to June 2021;

>> (ii)       Wrongful deduction or wrongful withholding of a sum of S$1,600 ($800 per month);

>> (iii)       Constant late payments of monthly rental from December 2019 to September 2021;

>> (iv)       Failure to pay late payment interests;

> (b)     Failure to maintain public liability insurance policy; and

> (c)     Failure to seek landlord’s consent on amendment & alterations.

9       The Plaintiffs’ position is that to date, the Defendant has failed, refused, and/or neglected to delivery up possession of the Premises to the Plaintiffs and wilfully held over the Premises. As such, pursuant to s 28(4) of the Civil Law Act, the Defendant is liable to pay to the Plaintiffs double rent at the rate of S$11,600 for the period from 1October 2021 until delivery of possession of the Premises. The Plaintiffs’ claim against the Defendant for the following:

> (a)     Possession of the said Premises;

> (b)     Late payment interests which is deemed as rent;

> (c)     Double rent at the rate of $11,600 per month from October 2021 until delivery up possession of the Premises, or alternatively for damages to be assessed;

> (d)     Alternatively, double rent at the rate of $11,600 per month from December 2021 until delivery up possession of the Premises, or alternatively for damages to be assessed.

10     For completeness, the Plaintiffs’ SOC also contain other claims such as those relating to the reinstatement of Premises. However, they did not affect my decision in any way given that the Defendant did not raise any striking out arguments in respect of these claims. We now turn to the arguments which the Defendant did raise in respect of the alleged breaches and the Plaintiffs’ right of forfeiture.

### Defendant’s striking out arguments

11     The Defendant applied to strike out the entirety of the Plaintiff’s SOC on the premise that the SOC discloses no reasonable cause of action against the Defendant, is frivolous or vexatious for being legally unsustainable, and/or is otherwise an abuse of the process of the court.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) For ease of addressing the Defendant’s arguments in relation to each of the alleged breaches, I adopted the brief descriptions of the breaches as set out in the Defendant’s written submissions:[^3]

> (a)     That the Defendant had alleged failed, refused and/or neglected to pay the full rent due for May 2021 to June 2021 (“**Failure to Pay Full Rent Issue**”);

> (b)     That the Defendant allegedly wrongfully deducted and withheld the sum of S$1,600 for the months of May 2021 and June 2021 (i.e. S$800 per month) (“**Wrongful Deduction/Withholding Issue**”);

> (c)     That for the period of December 2019 to September 2021, the Defendant constantly failed to pay the monthly rental of S$5,800 on the first day of every month (“**Late Payment Issue**”);

> (d)     That the Defendant allegedly failed to maintain public liability insurance policy (“**Public Liability Insurance Issue**”); and

> (e)     That the Defendant allegedly failed to obtain the Plaintiffs’ written consent prior to making any alterations and/or additions to the Premises (“**Renovation Issue**”).

12     Apart from the submissions made in relation to each alleged breach, the Defendant also argued that the purported Notice of Termination was invalid for failing to comply with the requirements set out in s 18(1) of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (“CLPA”), which is reproduced below for reference:

> 18.—(1)    A right of re-entry or forfeiture under any provision or stipulation in a lease, for a breach of any covenant or condition in a lease, shall not be enforceable, by action or otherwise, unless the lessor serves on the lessee a notice specifying the particular breach complained of and, if the breach is capable of remedy, requiring the lessee to remedy the breach, and, in any case, requiring the lessee to make compensation in money for the breach, and the lessee fails, within a reasonable time thereafter, to remedy the breach, if it is capable of remedy, and to make reasonable compensation in money, to the satisfaction of the lessor, for the breach.

13     The Defendant submitted that the Plaintiffs’ entire action is legally unsustainable and ought to be struck out because the purported Notice of Termination is defective and bad for the following reasons:[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4)

> (a)     The alleged Renovation Issue breach is ambiguous and bad for failing to provide sufficient particulars of the alleged breaches, i.e. the particular alterations and additions which were said to have been made without the Plaintiffs’ consent.

> (b)     Further, the breach(es) (which are denied by the Defendant) were capable of remedy, but the landlord did not require the Defendant to, nor provide the Defendant the opportunity to remedy the breach(es), contrary to the requirements stipulated in s 18(1) of the CLPA.

14     A central plank of the Defendant’s case in the striking out application was that the Plaintiffs have, by their continued acceptance of the payment of the rental sum of S$5,800 each month to date, impliedly waived their right of forfeiture against the Defendant and recognised the continuation of the Tenancy Agreement.[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5) Given that this was a recurring and overarching argument which permeated throughout the Defendant’s submissions on each of the alleged breaches, the waiver argument will be addressed below in greater detail in a separate section on its own after the issues on the alleged breaches and the Plaintiffs’ entitlement to the right of forfeiture are dealt with.

15     Lastly, the Defendant highlighted the coincidental timing of the Plaintiffs’ purported termination of the Tenancy Agreement on or around 20 September 2021 and the expiry of the time period during which the Plaintiffs were contractually obliged to consider the granting an option to renew to the Defendant.[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) The Defendant believes that the Plaintiffs had planned to terminate the Tenancy Agreement so that they could avoid their obligation to consider a renewal of the lease of the Premises to the Defendant, and had thus brought the present action for some other ulterior or collateral purpose such as pressuring the Defendant into giving up the lease.[^7]

### Issues to be determined

16     Based on the Plaintiffs’ claims in the SOC and the Defendant’s striking out arguments, I considered whether striking out was appropriate in connection with the following issues:

> (a)     Whether there were any breaches entitling the Plaintiffs to the right of forfeiture;

> (b)     Whether the Plaintiffs have in any event waived their right of forfeiture through the acceptance of rent; and

> (c)     Whether the Plaintiffs have brought the present action for some other ulterior or collateral purpose.

## My decision

17     I first begin by setting out below some of the relevant guiding principles in relation to striking out applications. In general, the threshold for striking out is a high one, and it will typically only be invoked in plain and obvious cases. The claim must be obviously unsustainable, the pleadings unarguably bad, and it must be impossible, not just improbable, for the claim to succeed before the court will strike it out: see _Manas Kumar Ghosh v MSI Ship Management Pte Ltd and others_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 4 SLR 935</span> at \[43\] to \[44\].

18     Under O 18 r 19(1)(a) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”), a claim can be struck out where it is patently clear that there is no reasonable cause of action on the face of the pleadings. As long as the statement of claim discloses some cause of action, or raises some question fit to be decided at the trial, the mere fact that the case is weak and is not likely to succeed is no ground for striking it out: _Gabriel Peter & Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin and others_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 3 SLR(R) 649</span> at \[21\].

19     Under O 18 r 19(1)(b) of the ROC, any pleading may be struck out if it is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious. An action is frivolous or vexatious if it is obviously unsustainable: _Singapore Civil Procedure 2021_ vol 1 (Cavinder Bull gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 2021) at para 18/19/12. An action is plainly or obviously unsustainable if it is either legally or factually unsustainable: _The “Bunga Melati 5”_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 4 SLR 546</span> at \[39\].

> (a)     An action is “legally unsustainable” if it may be clear as a matter of law at the outset that even if a party were to succeed in proving all the facts that he offers to prove he will not be entitled to the remedy that he seeks.

> (b)     An action is “factually unsustainable” if it is possible to say with confidence before trial that the factual basis for the claim is fanciful because it is entirely without substance, for example, if it is clear beyond question that the statement of facts is contradicted by all the documents or other material on which it is based.

20     As for O 18 r 19(1)(d) of the ROC, the phrase “abuse of the process of the Court” signifies that the process of the court must be used _bona fide_ and properly and must not be abused. The court will prevent the improper use of its machinery, and will prevent the judicial process from being used as a means of vexation and oppression in the process of litigation: _Gabriel Peter & Partners_ at \[22\].

### Whether there were any breaches entitling the Plaintiffs to the right of forfeiture

21     Counsel for the Defendant, Ms Zerlina Yee, relied on both limbs in O 18 r 19(1)(a) and O 18 r 19(1)(b) of the ROC to argue that the claims in respect of the Failure to Pay Full Rent Issue, the Wrongful Deduction/Withholding Issue, the Late Payment Issue, the Public Liability Issue and the Renovation Issue should be struck out. Counsel for the Plaintiffs, Mr Steven Lam, argued in the main that there were factual disputes to be resolved in respect of the breaches, and so long as any of the alleged breaches in the SOC provide a ground for forfeiture, the termination was valid.

22     When analysing each of the issues on the alleged breaches, I was particularly mindful that I was not in the position to adjudge on the eventual merits of the parties’ case, but rather my role was to evaluate whether striking out was justified or appropriate in light of the arguments raised by the Defendant. This was made necessary because in its written submissions and at the hearing before me, the Defendant argued quite extensively on the merits of its defence even though it was clear to me that many of those arguments involved factual determinations or engaged legal doctrines which are to be applied only after the facts have been established. The Defendant relied on O 18 r 19(1)(b) of the ROC, but yet where factual disputes were concerned, no specific arguments were made as to why the Plaintiffs’ claims were factually unsustainable. In the circumstances, when analysing each of the issues on the alleged breaches, I was cautious to ensure that the court was not conducting a mini-trial based on the affidavits, or embarking on a minute and protracted examination of the documents and facts of the case to see if the Plaintiffs have a cause of action: _Kim Hok Yung and others v Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA (trading as Rabobank) (Lee Mon Sun, third party)_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 2 SLR(R) 455</span> at \[9\].

#### The Failure to Pay Full Rent Issue and Wrongful Deduction/Withholding Issue

23     As the Defendant had advanced the same submissions in respect of the Failure to Pay Full Rent Issue and Wrongful Deduction/Withholding Issue, I analysed both of these issues conjunctively. The Plaintiffs’ claims in respect of both issues relate to the failure on the Defendant’s part to pay the full monthly rental payable for the months of May 2021 and June 2021, resulting in an outstanding sum of S$1,600. For reference, Clause 1.2(a) of the Tenancy Agreement reads as follows:

> 1.2 Rent

> The monthly rent and shall be paid as follows:

>> (a)     The monthly rent shall be Singapore Dollars Five Thousand and Eight Hundred Only ($5,800) per month.

>> (b)    The first payment of rent and of Singapore Dollars Five Thousand and Eight Hundred Only ($5,800) for the period from 1st day of December 2019 to the 31st day of December 2019 shall be paid upon execution of this Agreement.

>> (c)    Subsequent payment of monthly rent and service charge shall be payable monthly in advance on the first day of each and every month of the tenancy hereby created without any demand, deductions or set-off.

24     It was not disputed between parties that for the months of May and June 2021, the Defendant only paid S$5,000 per month for rental instead of S$5,800. In this regard, the Defendant stated on affidavit that the 1st Plaintiff had agreed to provide a rebate off the rental payable by S$800 for the months of May and June 2021.[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8) However, no direct documentary evidence was available as this agreement was said to be made over a phone call with the 1st Plaintiff on 20 May 2021. The 1st Plaintiff, on the other hand, denied any such agreement, and stated in his affidavit that Ms Yew had misrepresented to him that the government had given further rebates due to COVID-19.[^9] In support of his contention, the 1st Plaintiff produced portions of a WhatsApp conversation between himself and Ms Yew on 28 June 2021 and 30 June 2021:[^10]

> 28/06/2021 @ 10:28am

> Jolene Yew: Mr. Pang, it's given by the government. So next month I will give you $2500 ...

> 28/06/2021 @ 6:11pm

> Jolene Yew: Sorry Mr. Pang, I read it wrongly. The government didn't give. I will pay you in full by cash, same as last month. Thank you! See you on Thursday!

> 30/06/2021 @ 9:14pm

> Pang Kau Chai: May and June I collected $1600 less for rental You admitted you read it wrongly and gave $1600 less! Please pay to the landlord the exact amount!

> May June $1600

> July $5800

> Tomorrow 5-ish p.m.

25     I agreed with the Defendant that the WhatsApp extract did not completely support the 1st Plaintiff’s assertion that there was no agreement to provide a rebate off the rental payable for May 2021 and June 2021. However, given the lack of any direct evidence on any such agreement, I was hesitant to find that the alleged breach of Clause 1.2(a) of the Tenancy Agreement was factually unsustainable. Looking at the WhatsApp extract, the 1st Plaintiff had pointed out to Ms Yew on 30 June 2021 that there was a shortfall of S$1,600 for the months of May 2021 and June 2021. However, this S$1,600 was not paid by the Defendant until much later on 8 November 2021. Given the state of the affidavit evidence before me, it could not be incontrovertibly refuted that there remains a _prima facie_ breach of the Defendant’s obligation to pay rent under Clause 1.2(a) of the Tenancy Agreement. Whether there was indeed any agreement to reduce the rental payable, and the particular details of any such agreement, would be clearly issues of fact which should be more appropriately tested at trial. The Plaintiffs’ claim in respect of the alleged breach of Clause 1.2(a) of the Tenancy Agreement ought not be struck out.

26     The Defendant further argued that its payment of the S$1,600 on 8 November 2021 had in any event “extinguished” any cause of action, and therefore the Plaintiffs are not entitled to any right of forfeiture.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11) It was unclear what authority the Defendant was relying on to draw this conclusion. In the case of _Protax Co-operative Society Ltd v Toh Teng Seng and anor_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] SGHC 84</span>, it was held that for an actual receipt of rent to operate as a waiver, the receipt must be of rent accruing due after the cause of forfeiture has arisen. At \[27\] of _Protax_, Worley J in _Low Bee Hoe (w) v Morsalim Chin_ (1947) MLJ 3 was quoted as follows:

> I do not know of any authority for the proposition that acceptance, after expiry of notice to quit, of rent accrued due for a period not going beyond the date of expiration of the notice can be a waiver of that notice and I cannot find any authority for it in the cases to which I was referred. The case most in point is _Price v Worwood_ (1859) 28 L.J. 329 where Baron Martin said **"a receipt of rent to operate as a waiver of forfeiture must be a receipt of rent which was become due after the forfeiture was incurred and the mere receipt of the money afterwards the rent having become due previously is of no consequence and for the very plain reason that the entry for a condition broken does not at all affect the right to receive payment of a pre-existing debt." In my view this reasoning applies equally to receipt of rent accrued due prior to the expiry of a notice to quit.**

> (Emphasis in original)

27     On the facts of the present case, it was not clear to me how the payment of S$1,600, which was a pre-existing debt accrued due prior to the Notice of Termination dated 20 September 2021, would have the effect of a waiver. It was not disputed that a lessor has a right to forfeit a lease for non-payment of rent if this is expressly reserved by the lease. Based on the alleged breach of Clause 1.2(a) of the Tenancy Agreement, the Plaintiffs were _prima facie_ entitled to the right of forfeiture pursuant to Clause 4.1 of the Tenancy Agreement.

#### The Late Payment Issue

28     The Plaintiffs claim that during the period of December 2019 to September 2021, the Defendant would constantly fail to pay monthly rental on time, despite the fact and agreement between parties that the Defendant was supposed to pay the monthly rental on the 1st day of every month, pursuant to Clause 1.2(c) of the Tenancy Agreement. For reference, Clause 1.2(c) of the Tenancy Agreement reads as follows:

> 1.2 Rent

> The monthly rent and shall be paid as follows:

>> (a)    The monthly rent shall be Singapore Dollars Five Thousand and Eight Hundred Only ($5,800) per month.

>> (b)    The first payment of rent and of Singapore Dollars Five Thousand and Eight Hundred Only ($5,800) for the period from 1st day of December 2019 to the 31st day of December 2019 shall be paid upon execution of this Agreement.

>> (c)     Subsequent payment of monthly rent and service charge shall be payable monthly in advance on the first day of each and every month of the tenancy hereby created without any demand, deductions or set-off.

29     In Ms Yew’s affidavit, she stated that since the commencement of the tenancy on 1 December 2019, the arrangement between parties for the payment of monthly rental had always been subject to the 1st Plaintiff’s personal collection which was uncertain because it was up to his whim and fancy.[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12) She highlighted various transcripts of the WhatsApp exchanges between the 1st Plaintiff and Ms Yew in June and August 2021 which evidenced the difficulty faced by Ms Yew in contacting the 1st Plaintiff in order to make the rental payments, as well as the flexibility of the arrangement for the 1st Plaintiffs’ collection of rental payments from the Defendant.[^13]

30     According to Ms Yew, the 1st Plaintiff had refused to provide her with his bank account details, and would only arrange for her to meet him at his whim, usually at the Premises, to tender the monthly rental payments.[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14) There was no other way for the Defendant to pay the monthly rentals.[^15] The Defendant did not object to this because the landlord was the one who had devised such an arrangement. Thus, it is not for the 1st Plaintiff to now deny or renege upon such arrangement and claim that the Defendant has breached the written terms of the Tenancy Agreement.[^16]

31     The 1st Plaintiff disagreed that the collection of the monthly rental was up to his whim and fancy. His response in the affidavit was that if the Defendant had been ready to make the rental payment on time each month, it could have informed him _via_ WhatsApp or put him on notice that payment was ready for collection, and/or date their payment cheques on the 1st day of every month. However, the Defendant did not do so.[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17) In the 1st Plaintiff’s affidavit, he exhibited multiple dishonoured cheques handed to him by the Defendant for the period between March 2021 to April 2021 to show that the Defendant was not only not willing and not ready to pay the monthly rental, but was also not able to make the full monthly rental on the first day of each month.[^18] It was due to the multiple dishonoured cheques that he had resorted to informing the Defendant that he would rather receive cash as monthly rental.[^19]

32     Further, Ms Yew stated that pursuant to s 5 of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020, the Defendant had served on the 1st Plaintiff a Notification for Relief dated 1 August 2020 containing a proposal to make payment of the monthly rental of S$5,800 in two equal payments of S$2,900 to be paid on the first and fourth week of each month.[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20) The Notification for Relief was sent _via_ WhatsApp and the contents were explained verbally to the 1st Plaintiff as he does not understand English.[^21] The 1st Plaintiff had agreed to receive two cheques of S$2,900 each for the period of August to October 2020.[^22] The 1st Plaintiff in his affidavit stated simply that even though the Defendant had made such a request, he did not agree to such a payment arrangement.[^23]

33     In my assessment, the Plaintiffs have shown a _prima facie_ breach by the Defendant to pay monthly rental on the first day of every month pursuant to its obligation under Clause 1.2(c) of the Tenancy Agreement. In so far as the Defendant is now claiming that the payment arrangements have been varied by parties’ agreement or conduct, this would constitute a triable issue. The same applies for the Defendant’s contention that there was an agreement for the Defendant to make payment of the monthly rental of S$5,800 in two equal payments of S$2,900 to be paid on the first and fourth week of each month. This has been flatly denied by the 1st Plaintiff under circumstances where no direct evidence was adduced in relation to any such agreement. Save in the plainest of cases, a court should not in a striking out application choose between conflicting accounts of crucial facts: _The “Bunga Melati 5”_ at \[45\]. Thus, the Plaintiffs’ claim in respect of the alleged breach of Clause 1.2(c) of the Tenancy Agreement should not be struck out. Based on the alleged breach of Clause 1.2(c) of the Tenancy Agreement, the Plaintiffs were _prima facie_ entitled to the right of forfeiture pursuant to Clause 4.1 of the Tenancy Agreement.

34     For completeness, there was no merit to the Defendant’s argument that s 18(9) of the CLPA only applies to non-payment of rent, but not late payment of rent or partial payment of rent. No authorities were cited in support of drawing of such a narrow distinction. Clause 1.2 of the Tenancy Agreement is clear in setting out the payment terms for the monthly rent payable. In so far as the alleged breaches of Clause 1.2(a) and Clause 1.2(c) of the Tenancy Agreement are concerned, these pertain to the non-payment of rent and there is no requirement to serve a s 18(1) CLPA notice before a landlord may exercise his right of forfeiture for such breaches. The Plaintiffs’ claim in respect of the forfeiture of the Premises on account of the alleged breaches of Clause 1.2(a) and Clause 1.2(c) of the Tenancy Agreement could not be said to be plainly or obviously unsustainable.

#### The Public Liability Insurance Issue

35     The Plaintiffs claim that the Defendant, in breach of Clause 2.30 of the Tenancy Agreement, has failed to keep a public liability insurance for a sum as may be specified by the landlord, an adequate insurance policy which shall be taken out with an insurance company approved by the landlord, and any other insurance policies to cover any other risks during the period of the tenancy. For reference, Clause 2.30 of the Tenancy Agreement reads as follows:

> 2.30 Tenant's Insurance

> The Tenant shall at all times during the term hereby created and during any period of holding over, effect and keep current.

>> (a)    A public liability insurance policy for a sum as may be specified by the Landlord from time to time in respect of the said premises which shall be taken out with an insurance company approved by the Landlord in the Joint names of the Landlord and the Tenant and shall pay all premiums, costs and disbursements in connection thereof within seven (7) days after the same shall become due and payable.

>> (b)    An adequate insurance policy, which shall be taken out with an insurance company approved by the Landlord on the internal partitions and all goods belonging to or held in trust by the Tenant in the said premises against loss or damage by fire, water, damage or discharge from sprinkler systems etc.

>> (c)    Any other insurance policy or policies to cover any other risk as the Landlord may from time to time require and shall produce to the Landlord on demand the above mentioned policies as well as the receipts for payment of premium in respect thereof.

36     Based on the parties’ affidavit evidence alone, it was clear that there were no relevant insurance policies taken out for the period from 1 December 2020 to 6 January 2021. The Defendant’s only contention now is that the alleged breach of Clause 2.30 of the Tenancy Agreement was a single breach (as opposed to a continuing breach), and that the breach has been waived by the Plaintiffs’ acceptance of rent.[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24) For the purposes of the striking out application, I did not consider it strictly necessary to determine whether it was a single or continuing breach. Either way, it was not disputed that there has been a breach as Ms Yew acknowledged in her affidavit that there was a brief period of 1 December 2020 to 6 January 2021 during which there was an “apparent lapse” in the renewal of the insurance policies.[^25] For this reason, the Plaintiffs’ claim in respect of the alleged breach of Clause 2.30 of the Tenancy Agreement should not be struck out.

37     As for the Plaintiffs’ entitlement to the right of forfeiture based on this alleged breach, Mr Lam at the hearing fairly conceded that there was no proper s 18(1) CLPA notice that was served on the Defendant. Therefore, it would appear that the Plaintiffs’ right of forfeiture based on this alleged breach would not be enforceable, although this is not fatal to the Plaintiffs’ claim for possession of the Premises as the right of forfeiture could still be grounded on the alleged breaches of Clause 1.2(a) and Clause 1.2(c) of the Tenancy Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Plaintiffs’ claim in respect of the alleged breach of Clause 2.30 of the Tenancy Agreement should still stand, given that the SOC has sought for the alternative remedy of damages (to be assessed).

#### The Renovation Issue

38     The Plaintiffs claim that the Defendant has breached Clause 2.8(a) of the Tenancy Agreement as it had made multiple alterations and additions to the said Premises without first having obtained the Plaintiffs’ written consent. For reference, Clause 2.8(a) of the Tenancy Agreement reads as follows:

> 2.8 Alteration and Additions

> (a)    Not to make or permit to be made any alterations and additions to the said premises (whether or not structural) or to any of the Landlord's fixtures or fittings in the said premises without having first obtained the Landlord's written consent.

39     On the facts, it was not challenged that written consent for renovation works had not in fact been obtained, and this is technically a breach of Clause 2.8(a) of the Tenancy Agreement. The Defendant’s position is that the 1st Plaintiff had, on or about 20 May 2021, agreed to the Defendant’s proposed renovation works to the Premises.[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26) Further, the 1st Plaintiff had also met the Project Manager of the renovation works at the Premises on 19 May 2021, and therefore would have been aware that the Defendant was proceeding with the renovation works in anticipation of the renewal of the lease of the Premises by way of its exercise of the option to renew.[^27]

40     The Defendant acknowledged that there is no contemporaneous documentary support for the agreement on 20 May 2021 as the agreement was obtained through a telephone call between Ms Yew and the 1st Plaintiff. What the Defendant could show instead was a series of WhatsApp exchanges between the 1st Plaintiff and Ms Yew which supports the Defendant’s contention that the 1st Plaintiff was aware that the Defendant was proceeding with the renovation works. In the WhatsApp exchanges dated 8 June 2021, the 1st Plaintiff referred to a contractor who was introduced at a meeting between the 1st Plaintiff and Ms Yew on 19 May 2021 at 6.30pm:[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28)

> 
| 

Ms Yew:

 | 

Has the roof been repaired?

 |
| 

1st Plaintiff:

 | 

Roof repair needs your subsidy. Both parties have to bear cost

 |
| 

Ms Yew:

 | 

Why?

 |
| 

Ms Yew:

 | 

The contract didn’t say I need to be responsible for that

 |
| 

1st Plaintiff:

 | 

Because your kitchen is rusting, my place also followed to rust. Your contractor has been to the second floor to observe the water leakage. The contractor also said in front of us that you have to share the cost.

 |
| 

Ms Yew:

 | 

Who is the contractor?

 |
| 

1st Plaintiff:

 | 

That’s the contractor on May 19, 2021 6.30p.m.

 |
| 

Ms Yew:

 | 

That contractor doesn’t want to do

 |
| 

Ms Yew:

 | 

Please find another person

 |
| 

Ms Yew:

 | 

Let me know after repair, thank you

 |

  
  

41     The Plaintiffs, in response, argued that the issue of permission or consent was clearly disputed. Mr Lam pointed to further WhatsApp exchanges between the 1st Plaintiff and Ms Yew on 25 July 2021 which appear to indicate that the 1st Plaintiff did not have the relevant information regarding certain permit that may be required for renovation works:[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29)

> 
| 

Ms Yew:

 | 

Please note, when you install the chimney, did your tenant apply for the permit from the government department? The contractor needs time to check the drawing ???

 |
| 

1st Plaintiff:

 | 

Runway 80 Pte Ltd. F&B information for a few years, the landlord has little information. Please check everything. Please check with the person in charge, James Ng. When both parties sign the rental contract, explain the content of the contract in details. Please refer to – \[cut off\]. After the tenancy agreement begins, the tenant and the contractor need to apply for a permit from the relevant government department before they can start renovation. The landlord does not have tenant information. After collecting the rent on July 1, you agreed to give the landlord an insurance policy for Shop 162. I haven’t received it yet.

 |
| 

Ms Yew:

 | 

Are you talking about what happened in 2018?

 |
| 

Ms Yew:

 | 

My current renovation does not require permit. I ask my contractor to call you to clarify?

 |
| 

Ms Yew:

 | 

My insurance, last month I said I will make a copy and pass to you with the rent. I also asked if there’s any other thing that you needed, and you said no. Now you talk about permit, I tell James Ng to talk to you. It should have nothing to do with me.

 |

  
  

42     The above correspondences, as exhibited in the 1st Plaintiff’s affidavit, were merely selected portions highlighted to me at the hearing out of a long-running chain of WhatsApp exchanges between the 1st Plaintiff and Ms Yew. Evidently, it would not have been appropriate for me to strike out the Plaintiffs’ claim simply because the 1st Plaintiff appeared to have been aware of the renovation works based on these selected extracts. The full chain of WhatsApp exchanges, as well as any other relevant evidence on this issue, would have to be examined at trial.

43     The Defendant argued that in any event, the present case is similar to the case of _Michael Ma Zhen Hu v Florentine Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 272</span> and submitted the following:

> (a)     Even if the 1st Plaintiff had not explicitly given his approval or consent for the renovation works, the 1st Plaintiff had, by his conduct, represented to the Defendant that he has approved or consented to the renovation. In other words, the 1st Plaintiff had acted in such a manner as to lead the Defendant to believe that he had agreed to allow the Defendant to carry out the renovation works (_Michael Ma_ at \[20\]). By virtue of that, the Plaintiffs are now estopped from saying that they object to the renovation (_Michael Ma_ at \[27\]).

> (b)     Further, the Plaintiffs have not adduced any evidence to show that they had not consented to the renovation when or soon after the 1st Plaintiff became aware of the renovation at the Premises. There is no WhatsApp message, no correspondence, no emails sent by the Plaintiffs to the Defendant expressing the Plaintiffs’ objections to the renovation during the material time of the 1st Plaintiff becoming aware of the renovation. The first sign of the Plaintiffs’ objections only surfaced on 20 September 2021, when the Plaintiffs’ solicitors sent a letter to the Defendant and referred to, _inter alia_, the alleged breach of Clause 2.8(a) of the Tenancy Agreement by “making multiple alterations and additions to the Premises without first having obtained \[the Plaintiffs’\] consent” (_Michael Ma_ at \[23\]).

> (c)     In any event, even if there had been a technical breach of Clause 2.8(a) of the Tenancy Agreement in that the Defendant had failed to obtain the written consent of the Plaintiffs for the renovation works, the Plaintiffs had continued to accept rent after they knew of the alleged breach (_Michael Ma_ at \[31\], \[32\]). As such, the acceptance of the monthly rental paid by the Defendant to the Plaintiffs constitutes a waiver of their right of forfeiture, regardless of whether the Plaintiffs have any intention for the acceptance to constitute a waiver (_Michael Ma_ at \[32\], \[35\]).

44     In my view, the Defendant’s reliance on _Michael Ma_ at this juncture was wholly misconceived. Notably, _Michael Ma_ was a case that received proper ventilation of the relevant evidence and legal arguments following a trial, whereas in the present case the Defendant sought to strike out the Plaintiffs’ claims at the interlocutory stage which, if allowed, would have the premature effect of depriving the Plaintiffs the chance to have their claims tried by the court. From the selected portions of the WhatsApp exchanges alone, there were clearly factual issues to be resolved in determining whether the 1st Plaintiff had indeed represented to the Defendant, by words or conduct, that he has approved or consented to the renovation. This did not change even if the Plaintiffs have not adduced any evidence to show that they had not consented to the renovation after the 1st Plaintiff became aware of the renovation at the Premises. Whether the Plaintiffs should be estopped from saying that they object to the renovation would be an issue where the evidence would have to be tested at trial, as was the case in _Michael Ma_. The Plaintiffs’ claim in respect of the alleged breach of Clause 2.8(a) of the Tenancy Agreement should not be struck out.

45     As for the Plaintiffs’ entitlement to the right of forfeiture based on this alleged breach, Mr Lam again fairly conceded that there was no proper s 18(1) CLPA notice that was served on the Defendant. Thus, it would appear that the Plaintiffs’ right of forfeiture based on this alleged breach would not be enforceable, although this is not fatal to the Plaintiffs’ claim for possession of the Premises as the right of forfeiture could still be grounded on the alleged breaches of Clause 1.2(a) and Clause 1.2(c) of the Tenancy Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Plaintiffs’ claim in respect of the breach of Clause 2.8(a) of the Tenancy Agreement should still stand, given that the SOC has sought for the alternative remedy of damages (to be assessed).

### Whether the Plaintiffs have in any event waived their right of forfeiture through the acceptance of rent

46     We now turn to the central plank of the Defendant’s case in the present striking out application. The Defendant argued that the Plaintiffs have, to date, despite their assertion that the Tenancy Agreement had been terminated either on 30 September 2021 or 30 November 2021, continued accepting payment of the rental sum of S$5,800 each month from the Defendant. As such, by their continued acceptance of the sum of S$5,800 each month paid by the Defendant as rental under the Tenancy Agreement after the cause of forfeiture, the Plaintiffs have impliedly waived their right of forfeiture against the Defendant and recognised the continuation of the Tenancy Agreement.[\[note: 30\]](#Ftn_30) In support of this argument, the Defendant relied on the following propositions from _Protax_:

> (a)     A landlord’s right of re-entry may be waived either expressly or impliedly. There is an implied waiver where the lessor, with knowledge of the cause of forfeiture, does any act which recognises the continued existence of the tenancy. An action for, demand for, or receipt of rent accrued due since the cause of forfeiture with knowledge by the lessor of that cause is an implied waiver (_Protax_ at \[21\]).

> (b)     The landlord has the option whether to take advantage of a forfeiture or not; and if he elects not to do so, the forfeiture is waived. Such election may be either express or implied, and it is implied when, after the cause of forfeiture has come to his knowledge, the landlord does any act whereby he recognises the relationship of landlord and tenant as still continuing. If it is shown that, with knowledge of the cause of forfeiture, the landlord has recognised the tenancy, he will be precluded from saying that he did not do the act with the intention of waiving the forfeiture (_Protax_ at \[22\]).

> (c)     Waiver is entirely a matter of law and not of the parties’ intentions. A landlord therefore cannot, with knowledge of the event of forfeiture, avoid a waiver of forfeiture by accepting or demanding rent accruing due after that event by stipulating that the rent was accepted “under protest” or “without prejudice”. The fact that the landlord did not intend to waive is irrelevant (_Protax_ at \[24\]).

47     From the outset, there were at least two difficulties I had with the waiver argument which eventually militated against any striking out. First, there would be a triable issue as to whether there could even be any waiver in the present case given that the Plaintiffs have already sought to exercise their right of forfeiture by way of the Notice of Termination. In _Protax_, Chan Seng Onn JC (as he then was) emphasised, in bold and underline (at \[22\]), the principle that once a landlord has shown a final determination to take advantage of the forfeiture, no subsequent act will operate as a waiver:

> A demand made by the landlord or his agent with knowledge of the breach for rent due after the cause of the forfeiture operates as a waiver. Where money is accepted, it is a question of fact whether it is tendered and accepted as rent; if it is so tendered and accepted, it is then a principle of law that, so long as the landlord then knew of the breach, the acceptance constitutes a waiver. Thus the fact that the landlord, by accepting rent, has no actual intention of waiving the breach does not prevent his action amounting in law to a waiver. Nor can the landlord prevent the waiver by demanding or accepting rent without prejudice. An acceptance of rent in error by a managing agents clerk will bind the landlord and waive the breach. **If, however, the landlord has already shown a final determination to take advantage of the forfeiture, for instance by commencing an action to recover possession, no subsequent act, whether receipt of rent, or distress, or otherwise, will operate as a waiver. Forfeiture is not waived by acceptance of rent accrued due before the cause of forfeiture unless at the same time the landlord recognises the tenancy as subsisting, as, for example, where he describes the tenant as such in the receipt.**

> (Emphasis in original)

48     The passage cited above is consistent with the general understanding that a landlord has the option whether to take advantage of a forfeiture (or not). If the landlord manifests to the tenant unequivocally that he has elected in a particular manner, he will be bound by such an election, and his election cannot be contradicted by any subsequent acts or words. Here, if the Plaintiffs have already irrevocably elected to exercise their right of forfeiture and brought the Tenancy Agreement to an end, then no subsequent acts by the Plaintiffs could be relied on to qualify their election, and the Defendant’s waiver argument would fail _in limine_.

49     Mr Lam argued that the Plaintiffs in this case have shown a final determination to take advantage of the forfeiture by sending the Notice of Termination dated 20 September 2021 to the Defendant and exercised their right to terminate and re-entry. In the correspondences between parties following the Notice of Termination, the Plaintiffs reiterated that the tenancy have already been terminated and any continuing occupation after 30 September 2021 (i.e. from 1 October 2021 onwards) would be deemed as holding over after the determination of the tenancy:[\[note: 31\]](#Ftn_31)

> (a)     On 24 September 2021, the Defendant wrote to the Plaintiffs’ solicitors stating that the “_agreed rent of S$5,800 is ready on 1 October 2021_”, and asked for the Plaintiffs “_provide their bank account details_” for the Defendant to make payment.

> (b)     On 4 October 2021, the Plaintiffs’ solicitors wrote to the Defendant stating that “_\[the Plaintiffs\] have already terminated the said tenancy_”, and warned the Defendant that any continuing occupation of the Premises after 30 September 2021 “_will be deemed to be holding over after determination of the tenancy, with double rent payable until possession is properly and physically handed to \[the Plaintiffs\]_”.

> (c)     On 8 November 2021, the Defendant’s then-appointed solicitors, Anthony Law, wrote to the Plaintiffs’ solicitors stating that the Defendant will be making payment of S$11,600 (being rent payable for October 2021 and November 2021) plus S$1,600. On the same day, a total sum of S$13,200 was paid.

> (d)     On 12 November 2021, the Plaintiffs’ solicitors wrote to Anthony Law stating that in so far as the payment of S$11,600 is concerned, the acceptance of the said sum “_does not mean that \[the Plaintiffs\] are waiving their rights as already clearly stated_” in their previous letters “_in relation to \[the Plaintiffs’\] rights to double rental flowing from the wrongful holding over after the determination of the tenancy_”.

> (e)     On 30 November 2021, Anthony Law wrote to the Plaintiffs’ solicitors stating that the Defendant “_shall continue to make payment of S$5,800 monthly to \[the Plaintiffs’ solicitors’ firm\] by way of PayNow_”.

> (f)     On 30 November 2021, the Plaintiffs’ solicitors wrote to the Defendant to reiterate that “_Notice of Immediate Termination was already provided for in the letter_” dated 20 September 2021.

> (g)     On 2 December 2021, after the Plaintiffs’ solicitors received a sum of S$5,800 in their firm’s account on 1 December 2021, the Plaintiffs’ solicitors wrote to Anthony Law stating that the Plaintiffs “_do not accept that the Defendant has a right to continue to reside and/or occupy the Premises after the formal notice of termination was given on 20th September 2021”_.

50     These correspondences appeared to demonstrate that the Plaintiffs have consistently and resolutely maintained their position that the Tenancy Agreement have already been brought to an end following the Notice of Termination, and it was at least arguable that the Plaintiffs have shown a final determination to take advantage of the forfeiture such that no subsequent acts will operate as a waiver. Nevertheless, any eventual finding as to whether the Plaintiffs have indeed made such an election should be informed by a close and careful examination of all the relevant circumstances and factual matrix. At the striking out stage of the proceedings, it was simply not appropriate for me to render any conclusive finding on whether there has been an election or otherwise based solely on affidavit evidence alone.

51     Second, there would be triable issues as to whether the sums accepted by the Plaintiffs each month were indeed accepted as rent, and whether in accepting these sums the Plaintiffs have recognised the relationship of landlord and tenant as still existing and/or continuing. Where money is accepted, it is a question of fact whether it is tendered and accepted as rent. If it is so tendered and accepted, then it is a principle of law that so long as the landlord then knew of the breach, the acceptance constitutes a waiver: _Protax_ at \[22\]. Referring back to the Defendant’s correspondences to the Plaintiffs above at paragraphs 49(a), (c) and (e), the Plaintiffs’ replies to these correspondences suggested that they did not intend for the payments to be accepted as rent paid pursuant to a subsisting landlord-tenant relationship following the determination of the tenancy:[\[note: 32\]](#Ftn_32)

> (a)     On 4 October 2021, the Plaintiffs’ solicitors wrote to the Defendant stating that in so far as the offer to make payment of S$5,800 is concerned, the Plaintiffs would “_accept this payment as part payment of the double rental due to \[the Plaintiffs\] in light of the termination of the tenancy, and the continuing occupation and possession of the Premises despite the termination_”.

> (b)     On 12 November 2021, the Plaintiffs’ solicitors wrote to Anthony Law stating that in so far as the payment of S$11,600 is concerned, the acceptance of the said sum “_does not mean that \[the Plaintiffs\] are waiving their rights_” as already clearly stated in their previous letters.

> (c)     On 2 December 2021, after the Plaintiffs’ solicitors received a sum of S$5,800 in their firm’s account on 1 December 2021, the Plaintiffs’ solicitors wrote to Anthony Law stating that the payment held in the firm’s account “_will not be treated as payment for rental, but as part payment of the damages and/or losses and/or double rental and/or other costs and disbursements_” due from the Defendant to the Plaintiffs.

52     Based on the foregoing, it appeared that the Plaintiffs did not demand any payment of rental or monies following the Notice of Termination. Any payment of monies to the Plaintiffs (or to the Plaintiffs’ solicitors’ firm account) was on the Defendant’s own initiative and accord, to which the Plaintiffs expressly clarified that these monies should not be treated as rental payment but as “part payment of the damages and/or losses and/or double rental and/or other costs and disbursements”. Given these circumstances, it was certainly not clear beyond question that the Plaintiffs have lost their right of forfeiture. If the Defendant wishes to rely on (and succeed in) its waiver argument, this would necessarily raise triable issues as to whether the monies were in fact received as rental payments, and whether in accepting these monies the Plaintiffs have recognised the relationship of landlord and tenant as still existing and/or continuing. Again, these issues should not be disposed of summarily based merely on affidavit evidence.

53     The Defendant further contended that a landlord could not, with knowledge of the event of forfeiture, avoid a waiver of forfeiture by accepting or demanding rent accruing due after that event by stipulating that the rent was accepted “under protest” or “without prejudice”: _Protax_ at \[24\]. This, in my view, did not advance their case much further. It is not controversial that waiver is entirely a matter of law and not of the parties’ intention. However, the applicability of waiver would depend on whether there is an anterior finding that the monies tendered and received by the Plaintiffs were in fact received as rent. In _Fico Sports Inc Pte Ltd v Thong Hup Gardens Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 1 SLR 40</span>, it was observed that the question to be answered in each case is whether it was rent that was demanded and paid. If it was damages for trespass that was demanded and paid, then there would be no waiver: _Fico Sports_ at \[120\]. Judith Prakash J (as she then was) went on to lay down the following principle as stated in _Leivest International Pte Ltd v Top Ten Entertainment Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 1 SLR(R) 888</span> at \[42\]:

> In _Windmill Investments (London) Ltd v Milano Restaurant Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1962\] 2 QB 373</span>, rent was paid and the landlord’s receipt stated expressly that ‘This receipt is given without prejudice to the following breaches of covenant …’ with a breach spelt out. There was a dispute whether the receipt constituted a waiver of the breach. Megaw J found in favour of the tenant, and explained at 376:

>> **\[I\]t is a question of fact whether the money tendered is tendered as, and accepted as, rent, as distinct, for example, from money tendered and accepted as damages for trespass.** That is a question of fact. **Once it is decided as a fact that the money was tendered and accepted as rent, the question of its consequences as a waiver is a matter of law.**

>> (Emphasis in bold added)

54     In the present case, the triable issue that would have to be answered is whether it was rental payments that were paid and received, or whether the sums were tendered and received as “part payment of the damages and/or losses and/or double rental and/or other costs and disbursements”. The consequences of waiver as a matter of law would only apply after it has been decided that the monies were in fact tendered and accepted as rent. However, as I have alluded to above, the fact-centric nature of such a determination ought not to be made at this stage based merely on affidavit evidence.

55     For the above reasons, I found that the Defendant’s overarching waiver argument could not give rise to any blanket basis for the Plaintiffs’ claims, either in its entirety or otherwise, to be struck out. To my mind, the specific application of the doctrine of re-entry and waiver to the present case would involve mixed questions of fact and law, and no conclusive outcomes can be reached without first establishing the facts as disputed between the parties. The task of weighing and assessing the evidence should be reserved to the trial judge who will have the benefit of all the fact-finding processes in a full trial: _The “Bunga Melati 5”_ at \[52\].

### Whether the Plaintiffs have brought the present action for some other ulterior or collateral purpose

56     The Defendant argued that it has reason to believe that the timing of the Plaintiffs’ purported termination of the Tenancy Agreement on or around 20 September 2021 is coincidental, falling shortly within the expiry of the time period during which the Plaintiffs were contractually obliged to consider granting the option to renew to the Defendant pursuant to Clause 4.9 of the Tenancy Agreement, i.e. 3 months before the date of expiry of the Tenancy Agreement on 30 November 2021.[\[note: 33\]](#Ftn_33) Thus, the Defendant believes that the Plaintiffs had planned to terminate the Tenancy Agreement so that they could avoid their obligation to consider a renewal of the lease of the Premises to the Defendant.[^34] For reference, Clause 4.9 of the Tenancy Agreement reads as follows:

> 4.9 Option to Renew

> The Landlord shall on the written request of the Tenant made not less than three (3) months before the date of expiry of this Tenancy, and if there shall not at the time of such request be any existing breach or any non-observance of any of the conditions, covenants or stipulations on the part of the Tenant herein contained grant to the Tenant an extension of the Tenancy for a further term of One (1) year from the date of expiry of this Tenancy at a rent to be agreed based on the prevailing market rent but otherwise containing the like conditions, covenants and stipulations as are herein contained with the exception of this option for renewal.

57     Moreover, it was argued that the Plaintiffs had failed to give the Defendant any chance to respond to or remedy any alleged breaches committed by the Defendant, before negotiations in relation to the option to renew could be completed successfully.[\[note: 35\]](#Ftn_35) As such, according to the Defendant, it is plausible that the Plaintiffs had brought the present action for some other ulterior or collateral purpose such as pressuring the Defendant into giving up the lease of the Premises and vacating the same despite there being no legal basis to the Plaintiffs’ alleged claims. This, the Defendant argued, should not be condoned or allowed by the court, and the Plaintiffs’ claims should be struck out for being an abuse of the process of the court.[^36]

58     Parenthetically, I observed that the Defendant had proffered these reasons for the Plaintiffs’ commencement of the suit purely in a tentative and almost speculative manner. In its own words, the Defendant merely “has reason to believe” in the Plaintiffs’ “coincidental” timing of the termination, and that it was “plausible” that the Plaintiffs had brought the present action to pressure the Defendant into giving up the lease. There was otherwise no evidence whatsoever to conclude that the Plaintiffs’ action was not brought _bona fide_ for the purpose of obtaining relief: see _Gabriel Peter & Partners_ at \[22\].

59     More importantly, even if I could accept the Defendant’s contention that the Plaintiffs had planned to terminate the Tenancy Agreement so that they could avoid their obligation to consider a renewal of the lease, this would at best point towards the Plaintiffs’ underlying reason or motivation in commencing proceedings. I could not see how this should inherently prevent the court from determining a legitimate dispute if indeed contractual obligations have been breached. The Plaintiffs should not be barred from commencing legal proceedings to obtain the remedies sought in their SOC so long as they have a legitimate claim or basis to do so. Here, the Plaintiffs have amply shown that their case is a reasonable one, and therefore their claims should be allowed to run the full course to arrive at a final determination as to whether they ought to prevail eventually.

## Conclusion

60     In conclusion, many of the issues raised by the Defendant and contested at the hearing before me have manifested themselves to be precisely of the nature and character which would involve a minute and protracted examination of the documents and the facts of the case: _Gabriel Peter & Partners_ at \[18\]. It has been warned that engaging in such an exercise would effectively be usurping the proper function of the trial court. To this end, the High Court’s remarks in _Antariksa Logistics Pte Ltd and others v Nurdian Cuaca and others_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 117</span> at \[79\] concerning the court’s role in applications to strike out were particularly instructive and apposite:

> The court’s powers to strike out a claim on the four grounds under O 18 r 19(1) of the Rules of Court have been extensively considered and it is not necessary for me to re-state them here. **It suffices for me to say that in coming to my decision, I have borne in mind that the court should only exercise its power to strike out in “plain and obvious” cases. This power is to be exercised with caution, as striking out will have the effect of depriving a litigant of the opportunity to have his claim tried by the court**: _Kwa Ban Cheong_ (\[74\] supra) at \[29\], citing _North West Water Ltd v Binnie & Partners_ \[1990\] 3 All ER 547 at 553. **I am fully cognisant that the role of the court at this stage is not to carry out a minute and protracted examination of the documents and the facts of the case**: see _Gabriel Peter & Partners v Wee Chong Jin_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 3 SLR(R) 649</span> at \[18\] and _The Osprey_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 3 SLR(R) 1099</span> at \[6\]. **Otherwise, the court hearing the striking out application would effectively be usurping the proper function of the trial court, and conducting a trial of the case in chambers on affidavits only, without discovery and without evidence tested by cross-examination in the ordinary way**: see _Ko Teck Siang v Low Fong Mei_ <span class="citation">\[1992\] 1 SLR(R) 22</span> at \[15\], citing _Wenlock v Moloney_ \[1965\] 2 All ER 871 at 874. Instead, the correct question for the court to ask is whether the commencement of the present suit constitutes a plain and obvious case of an abuse of the process of the court.

> (Emphasis in bold added)

61     In my judgment, the present dispute was far from a plain and obvious case which warrants the draconian measure of striking out. Having considered the affidavits filed and heard parties’ submissions, I was convinced that there was no basis at all for the Plaintiffs’ SOC to be struck out, either in its entirety or otherwise. Accordingly, I dismissed the Defendant’s application.
