\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9183/2019/01.\]

10 October 2019

### District Judge Ong Chin Rhu:

## BACKGROUND

The Accused, Mr Shahul Hameed Bin Mohamed Dawood, _claimed trial_ to a charge under section 65B(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) (“RTA”) for using a mobile communication device while the vehicle he was driving was in motion on a road.

2       At the conclusion of the trial, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him of the charge. Thereafter, I sentenced the Accused to a fine of $900, in default, 5 days’ imprisonment, and disqualified him from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 7 months with effect from 1 August 2019_._ The Accused being dissatisfied with his _conviction_ has filed an appeal. He has _fully paid the fine_ of $900 and, upon his counsel’s application, _the disqualification order has been stayed_ pending the conclusion of the appeal.

3       I had provided brief oral grounds at the conclusion of the trial to explain some of my findings and my decision to convict the Accused[^1]. As the Accused had only _appealed against his conviction_, I shall focus, in these grounds, on elaborating on the reasons for my finding of guilt in this case.

## CHARGE

4       The details of the charge against the Accused were as follows:

> You \[...\] are charged that you, on 11 October 2017, at or about 1.10 p.m., along Cecil Street towards Maxwell Road, Singapore, being the driver of motor vehicle bearing registration no.: GZ 3262 X, did use a mobile telephone, which is a mobile communication device, while the said motor vehicle was in motion on a road, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 65B(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap. 276).

## UNDISPUTED FACTS AND THE ISSUE AT TRIAL

5       During the trial, it was not disputed by the defence that, at the time of the alleged offence, the Accused was the driver of vehicle bearing registration no. GZ 3262 X and was using his mobile phone (phone number XXXX2922) to communicate with a customer (phone number XXXX6885). The main issue in contention at trial was _whether his vehicle was in motion_ when he was using his mobile phone.

## THE CASE FOR THE PROSECUTION

6       The prosecution’s main witness was Staff Sergeant Mohammad Farhan Bin Ibrahim (“SSgt Farhan”), a traffic police officer.

7       SSgt Farhan testified that on 11 October 2017, he was deployed for morning shift patrol duties, covering the Central Business District area[^2]. SSgt Farhan set off for his duties at 7.05am in a patrol car[^3]. He kept records of his movement and summonses issued by him during his tour of duty in a patrol log sheet[^4] (a redacted copy of the log sheet was admitted and marked as exhibit P2). According to SSgt Farhan, at about 12.45pm, he went to Seah Im food court to purchase a meal. He resumed his rounds soon after. He recorded in exhibit P2 that he drove along Seah Im Road, Telok Blangah Road, Keppel Road, Anson Road, Cecil Street and Maxwell Road.

8       While SSgt Farhan was travelling along Anson Road towards Cecil Street at about 1.10pm, he spotted the Accused driving along Choon Guan Street and making a left turn into Cecil Street[^5]. In court, SSgt Farhan marked the position of the Accused’s vehicle with an X on a map (exhibit P1). SSgt Farhan saw that the Accused was using his mobile phone, by holding his phone near to his right ear[^6] with his right hand[^7], while executing the left turn into Cecil Street. At the material time, the Accused’s vehicle was travelling on the extreme left lane while SSgt Farhan’s car was on the move in the adjacent lane, to the Accused’s right[^8].

9       SSgt Farhan followed the Accused’s vehicle while it travelled along Cecil Street to the junction with Maxwell Road and continued to observe the Accused. During this time, SSgt Farhan’s patrol car was traveling side by side with, and to right of, the Accused’s vehicle. SSgt Farhan noted that throughout this journey, the Accused was still holding his phone[^9].

10     Upon both vehicles turning left into Maxwell Road from Cecil Street, SSgt Farhan turned on the blinkers of his patrol car and horned at the Accused to alert the latter to stop his vehicle[^10]. SSgt Farhan saw that the Accused turned to look right and spotted him[^11]. The Accused then “let go” of his phone[^12]. Eventually they both stopped their vehicles along Maxwell Road at the location marked with a red circle in exhibit P1.

11     The Accused alighted from his vehicle and repeatedly told SSgt Farhan that he did not use the mobile phone[^13]. SSgt Farhan requested the Accused to hand over his driving licence, which the Accused was reluctant to provide initially. When the Accused relented and handed over his licence and mobile phone, SSgt Farhan checked through the call log on the phone and noted the time and phone number of the last call, in exhibit P2[^14]. Upon screening the Accused with the operations room, SSgt Farhan learnt that the Accused was a second-time offender for driving while using a mobile device[^15].

12     SSgt Farhan then informed the Accused that he would seize the mobile phone with the SIM card. The Accused attempted to persuade SSgt Farhan not to do so, mentioning that he needed to call his family members and work staff. Eventually SSgt Farhan seized the mobile phone and issued the Accused with an acknowledgement slip.

13     SSgt Farhan recalled that he had engaged the Accused at Maxwell Road for about 20 to 25 minutes. He documented the above events and details leading to the issuance of a summons to the Accused in exhibit P2, about half an hour to 45 minutes after the incident[^16]. SSgt Farhan also lodged a seizure report for the mobile phone at 5.15pm on the same day (exhibit P3).

14     The prosecution’s other witness was Ms Thilaga Valli d/o Ramasamy (“Ms Thilaga”). Ms Thilaga was a senior executive from Starhub Limited, who was overall in charge of administration in the customer service department, and served as the single point of contact for law enforcement agencies. She tendered the call detail records for mobile number XXXX6885 which she had retrieved from Starhub (exhibit P4). The records showed that on 11 October 2017, at 1:09pm, mobile number XXXX2922 (the Accused’s number) had called mobile number XXXX6885 and the duration of the call, after it was connected, was 115 seconds[^17].

## THE CASE FOR THE DEFENCE

15     At the end of the prosecution’s case, I found that the prosecution had made out a prima facie case against the Accused on the proceeded charge and called upon the Accused to give evidence in his own defence. The Accused elected to testify, and he was the sole witness for the defence.

16     The Accused stated that he worked for Aerohub Logistics Private Limited as a delivery driver delivering IT products. On 11 October 2017, before 1pm, he was at International Plaza doing a delivery for a customer.

17     After completing the delivery, he entered his goods van (GX 3262 Y) which was parked midway along Choon Guan Street and tried to call his next customer (who was located at URA Centre along Maxwell Road) at XXXX6885, but found the line engaged. As such, the Accused started to drive off in his van. When his van reached the stop line of Choon Guan Street, he received a phone call. Seeing that he was not causing any obstruction to vehicles behind him, he stopped his van at the closest point to the stop line and answered the call, which was from the same customer he had tried to call earlier[^18]. Just then, the Accused saw a police car passing by in front of his vehicle. The police officer waved his hand to ask the Accused to follow him. The Accused panicked as he was still holding the phone in his right hand. As such, he dropped the phone onto his lap[^19].

18     Thereafter, the Accused complied with the instructions of the officer by continuing to make a left turn onto Cecil Street. He then followed the officer to Maxwell Road, where he stopped behind the police car. Thereat, the officer, SSgt Farhan, asked the Accused for his driving licence as well as his mobile device. The Accused asked SSgt Farhan to give him a chance but SSgt Farhan said that he could not do so. As such, the Accused handed his licence and mobile device to the officer. The Accused continued to plead to be given a chance but SSgt Farhan was busy writing some notes while screening the Accused[^20]. SSgt Farhan also went through the call logs on the Accused’s mobile phone and wrote the number in his notes[^21].

19     The Accused and SSgt Farhan remained at Maxwell Road for about 20 to 30 minutes because SSgt Farhan had wanted to confiscate the Accused’s SIM card but, when questioned by the Accused, was initially unsure if he could do so. In the mean time, the Accused also managed to persuade SSgt Farhan to allow him to make a call to his supervisor to inform her that he was unable to make any further deliveries, and to arrange for the collection of the items in his vehicle[^22].

20     The Accused emphasised that while he was using the mobile phone, his vehicle was not in motion. He further explained that he had pleaded with SSgt Farhan to give him a chance as he was under the mistaken impression that he was not allowed to use the mobile device at all times, even when his vehicle was not in motion[^23].

## ANALYSIS OF THE EVIDENCE AND THE COURT’S FINDINGS

21     As I had observed in my oral grounds, this case essentially turned on one man’s word against another. As such, I had scrutinised the evidence given by SSgt Farhan and the Accused with great care.

22     In my view, SSgt Farhan gave evidence in a frank and forthright manner, providing a clear and detailed account of the events. His evidence on the material facts of the case, such as the position of each vehicle when he first spotted the Accused using the mobile phone, had remained unshaken during cross-examination.

23     When giving evidence, the Accused suggested that SSgt Farhan could have made a mistake when trying to recall events that took place some 20 months before the trial[^24]. Having thoroughly examined SSgt Farhan’s testimony, I found his evidence to be internally consistent, and supported by the contemporaneous records he had kept in his patrol log sheet (exhibit P2) as well as the objective evidence in the Starhub records (exhibit P4). I should point out that in exhibit P2, SSgt Farhan had recorded what he observed in some detail:

> Spotted A/M along Cecil St →Maxwell Rd on extreme left lane of 4 lanes. A/M was seen holding on to his mobile phone on his right hand, placing it near to his right ear. Left hand on the steering wheel.[^25]

Hence, it was clear that even on the day of the offence, SSgt Farhan’s observations were that the Accused was using his mobile phone as his vehicle was in motion along Cecil Street towards Maxwell Road. As for the veracity of SSgt Farhan’s notes in exhibit P2, this was demonstrated by how he accurately noted, upon reviewing the Accused’s mobile phone call logs, that at “1309hrs”, the Accused had made an “outgoing” call to XXXX6885 lasting “1 minute 54 seconds”[^26]. It was not disputed that these details were fully borne out subsequently by exhibit P4.

24     In the Accused’s evidence[^27] as well as in the defence’s submissions at \[11\], an alleged “mistake” on the part of SSgt Farhan was highlighted to challenge his credibility. Having carefully considered the point, I was of the view that this did not impugn the credibility of SSgt Farhan in any material manner.

25     The alleged “mistake” was with regard to SSgt Farhan stating, in exhibit P3, that the “location of incident” was at “Maxwell Road towards South Bridge Road Near L/P 10”[^28]. In my view, any mistake, at the highest, was in relation to form-filling and did not affect the cogency of SSgt Farhan’s evidence relating to the offence. In fact, having scrutinised exhibit P3 carefully, I was of the view that there was no apparent error. Firstly, SSgt Farhan stated in P3 that the “Date/Time Of Incident” was “11/10/2017 13:10 to 11/10/2017 13:50”. Based on the evidence given in court, it was quite clear that he was referring to the entire course of events, from the commission of the offence to the completion of the summons process[^29]. In addition, the “brief details” of the incident was stated as follows:

> _On the above mention time, date & location, stopped_ A/M for the offence on phone driving & _seized_ the below mention items for second timer offender. (emphasis added)

It has never been disputed that the location where the Accused was stopped and had his mobile telephone and SIM card seized was precisely as stated in exhibit P3[^30].

26     The Accused’s evidence, on the other hand, was contradicted, on a material point, by objective evidence. The Accused testified that he first attempted to make a call to his next customer in URA Centre when he returned to his vehicle parked along the mid-section of Choon Guan Street. Finding that the line was engaged, he drove off towards the junction of Choon Guan Street and Cecil Street. While he stopped at the junction, he happened to receive an incoming call from that customer. As such, he remained stationary to take the call. This was the same position taken by the Accused in the defence case put to SSgt Farhan[^31]. The Accused also confirmed that this was the call reflected in exhibit P4 to have lasted for 115 seconds[^32]. When it was pointed out that P4 showed that this was an outgoing call from him to his customer, the Accused was unable to provide a coherent explanation for the contradiction:

> This part are made on --- on, uh, on, uh, a bit of confusion. Because I remember I called them, I informed them, after that I received a call then I hang down the phone. Then after that what other calls, I don’t remember. I only remember, uh, I remember calling, uh, I think, uh, I remember I calling my boss, uh, I remember like I calling by boss to inform about the goods, that’s all.[^33]

27     The Accused then shifted his version of events and testified that he stopped at the stop line, redialled his customer’s number, and spoke to him for 115 seconds[^34]. In my view, this did not make sense, especially when, according to the Accused, he had just tried to call the same customer while his vehicle was parked at the mid-section of the same street. If he had intended to redial his customer’s number, the simplest thing to do would have been to remain where he was parked, wait for a short while, and call his customer again. It was illogical for him to decide to start his vehicle, drive for a short distance, stop his vehicle at a spot closest to the junction with a major thoroughfare and pick up his phone again to make the call. On the contrary, the undisputed length of that conversation (almost 2 minutes) lent credence to SSgt Farhan’s evidence that the Accused was already using the phone when he was turning left from Choon Guan Street into Cecil Street, and continued doing until SSgt Farhan made his presence known to the Accused at Maxwell Road.

28     Having carefully scrutinised the totality of the evidence, I rejected the Accused’s defence as it was clearly an afterthought. I found SSgt Farhan to be a credible witness and accepted his evidence that the Accused was using his mobile device while his vehicle was in motion. I was thus satisfied that the prosecution had proven the charge against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt. As such, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him.

## ANTECEDENTS

29     The only relevant antecedent highlighted by the prosecution was that the Accused had paid a composition fine of $200 on 1 July 2016 for a similar offence under section 65B(1) of the Road Traffic Act.

## SENTENCE

#### Prescribed punishment

30     Section 68B(1) of the RTA provides for the sentence of a fine not exceeding $1,000, or an imprisonment term not exceeding 6 months, or both.

31     In addition, pursuant to section 42 of the RTA, the court may order the accused person to be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for life or for such period as the court may think fit.

#### Sentence imposed

32     Having considered all the facts and circumstances of this case, the parties’ submissions on sentence and the mitigation plea, as well as the High Court decision in **_Tan Kian Tiong v PP_** <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 153</span>, I sentenced the accused to a fine of $900, in default, 5 days’ imprisonment, and disqualified him from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 7 months with effect from 1 August 2019. As mentioned earlier in these grounds, the Accused has fully paid the fine. The disqualification order has been stayed pending the conclusion of the appeal.
