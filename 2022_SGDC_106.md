Criminal Law – Statutory Offences – Road Traffic Act

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9032/2022/01.\]

23 May 2022

### District Judge Melissa Tan:

1       The accused, Mr Huang Yukun, is a 59-year-old male Singapore Permanent Resident. He claimed trial to two charges under s 120(4) punishable under s 131(2)(a) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) (“RTA”) for failing to conform to the traffic red light signal. At the material time, he was a bus captain employed by Go Ahead Singapore Pte. Ltd. (“Go Ahead”).

2       At the conclusion of the trial, I found the accused guilty and convicted him of both charges. He was sentenced to a total fine of $1,600, in default six days’ imprisonment.

3       The accused lodged an appeal against his conviction and sentence.

## The charges

4       The charges were broadly similar, save for details relating to the time of the offence and the registration number of the vehicle that the accused was driving at the material time. The place of the offence in both charges was along Upper Changi Road East at the junction of Somapah Road towards Bedok Road, Singapore (“Junction”).

5       For ease of reference, I have reproduced both charges in full:

> 206215395411-1 (“First Charge”)

> You … are charged that you, on the 30th day of November 2020, at about 7.17 am, along Upper Changi Road East at the junction of Somapah Road towards Bedok Road, Singapore, whilst driving motor vehicle no SG 5078 G, did fail to conform to the traffic red light signal and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 120(4) Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276 punishable under Section 131(2)(a) of the same Act.

> 216014793011-1 (“Second Charge”)

> You … are charged that you, on the 29th day of January 2021, at about 7.19 am, along Upper Changi Road East at the junction of Somapah Road towards Bedok Road, Singapore, whilst driving motor vehicle no SG 5104 P, did fail to conform to the traffic red light signal and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 120(4) of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276 punishable under Section 131(2)(a) of the same Act.

6       A summary of both charges is set out below:

## Undisputed facts

7       The following facts were undisputed:

> (a)     The accused was the driver of the First Bus on the First Occasion.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) He drove the First Bus across the Junction.

> (b)     The accused was the driver of the Second Bus on the Second Occasion.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) He drove the Second Bus across the Junction.

> (c)     On both occasions, the traffic light signalling system at the Junction was in working condition.

## Issue to be determined

8       Given the undisputed facts in this case, the issue to be determined centred on whether, on each occasion, the accused failed to conform to the traffic red light signal at the Junction by driving across the stop line after the traffic light signal had turned red.

## The Prosecution’s case

9       The Prosecution called seven witnesses and primarily relied on the sequential images that were captured by the traffic red light camera at the incident location (“sequential images”) (see Exhibits P1, P4, P11 and P12), as well as the incident detail reports (see Exhibits P2 and P5). Exhibit P1 was the set of sequential images relating to the First Incident while Exhibit P4 was the set of sequential images relating to the Second Incident. As the accused requested for details in relation to the time interval between each sequential image, the Prosecution tendered enlarged versions of each sequential image that stated the timestamp of each sequential image more clearly. Exhibits P11 and P12 were the enlarged versions of the sequential images in Exhibits P1 and P4 respectively. The Prosecution did not tender video footage of the alleged offences or call eyewitnesses to the alleged offences.

10     The Prosecution’s witnesses’ evidence is outlined below.

### Initial reporting of the alleged offences

11     PW1 Timothy Chan Tim Ien and PW2 Sheikh Abdul Muzzammil bin Sheikh Abdul Feisal were reporting officers in the Camera Surveillance Unit of the Traffic Police at the material time. They processed cases that were assigned to them by their supervisor, PW3 Freddy Lim Yong Peng,[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) for traffic offences involving the beating of the traffic red light signal.[^4]

12     PW1 was assigned the case relating to the First Charge. He testified that the incident detail report (Exhibit P2) showed various details, including the same time stated in the traffic light camera sequential images (Exhibit P1), the location code, the vehicle licence plate number, the speed of the vehicle, incident type and the lane number being lane 3.[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5) He explained that that there were three enforcement lanes at the Junction and lane 3 referred to the third lane from the rightmost enforcement lane.[^6] He identified the vehicle involved by looking at the vehicle in lane 3 of the image on the second page of Exhibit P2.[^7] He zoomed in to obtain the vehicle licence plate number, as well as the make and order of the vehicle.[^8] Using Exhibit P1, he assessed that an offence of failing to conform to the traffic red light signal was committed.[^9] He also filed a report of traffic offence in relation to the First Occasion (Exhibit P3).[^10]

13     PW2 testified that he was assigned the case relating to the Second Charge,[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11) and that his supervisor provided him with the traffic light camera sequential images (Exhibit P4) and the incident detail report (Exhibit P5).[^12] Using Exhibit P4, he assessed that an offence of failing to conform to the traffic red light signal was committed.[^13] He also filed a report of traffic offence in relation to the Second Occasion (Exhibit P6).[^14]

14     PW3 testified that he was authorised to generate the sequential images and incident detail reports,[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15) using the Traffic Police’s computer system.[^16] After he retrieved the documents, he assigned the cases to PW1 and PW2 to verify the offences.[^17] Based on Exhibit P4, he was of the view that the vehicle crossed the stop line while the traffic light was red and continued to move while the traffic light remained red.[^18] He stated that the difference in traffic light signal could be seen from the overhead traffic light at the Junction. He also highlighted that when the traffic light signal turned from amber to red, the position of the traffic light signal also moved from left to right.[^19]

### Traffic red light camera system

15     PW4 Poh Boon Teck is the project manager of the digital traffic red light camera system. He works in NCS Pte Ltd, which manages this system for the Traffic Police.

16     PW4 explained that the traffic light camera system works on a simple loop cut system.[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20) There are two loops cut on the road of each enforcement lane.[^21] The loop distance is 3.8 metres when measured from the farthest distance to the stop line.[^22] The system receives the signal from the traffic light and is triggered when a vehicle crosses the stop line into the loops when the traffic light signal is red.[^23]

17     During cross-examination, when queried by the accused as to whether the system is triggered when the front or rear wheel passes the stop line, PW4 responded that it was triggered when the body mass of a vehicle enters the loop and the front wheel did not need to touch the loops. As long as “a huge metal body” encroached into the loop, the system will be triggered.[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24)

18     He gave evidence that the traffic light camera system generated Exhibit P1, pages 2 and 3 of Exhibit P2, Exhibit P4, and pages 2 and 3 of Exhibit P5.[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25) The sequential images in Exhibit P1 were captured by a sequential shot camera, which is constantly recording, after the vehicle crossed the stop line.[^26] When an offence is detected, the system would generate the images from before and after the vehicle crossed the stop line.[^27] Exhibit P4 was another series of sequential images showing that a bus passed through the red light on a different date.[^28]

19     The images in Exhibit P2 were taken by a high-speed camera.[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29) A flashlight was generated whenever the vehicle passed the stop line.[^30] Every offence would have two images captured, with the second image taken within one second after the first, to show that the vehicle crossed the stop line.[^31] The purpose of these images was to capture the licence plate of the vehicle involved.[^32] The flash photography resulted in the images in Exhibit P2 turning out much darker than the images in Exhibit P1.[^33] The vehicle licence plate would be illuminated while the surroundings will appear dark.[^34] He testified that pages 2 and 3 of Exhibit P5 similarly showed the vehicle licence plate of the bus involved.[^35]

20     During cross-examination, when queried by the accused about why the images in Exhibit P1 and Exhibit P2 showed a different number of cars on the road, PW4 emphasised that different cameras were used to capture the images in Exhibit P1 and pages 2 and 3 of Exhibit P2.[\[note: 36\]](#Ftn_36) Because of the different camera angles and specifications, the images generated would not be identical.[^37] Further, the focus of the camera for Exhibit P2 was on the enforcement lane.[^38]

21     In response to the accused’s cross-examination on whether the nine sequential images in Exhibit P1 were taken within one second, PW4 testified that it was more than one second[\[note: 39\]](#Ftn_39) but less than three seconds for typical sites where speed limit was 50 km per hour or lower.[^40] He was unable to provide details on the exact timestamps as to when the sequential images were taken as he was instructed that the information was covered under the Official Secrets Act.[^41]

### Traffic light signalling system

22     PW5 Lim Eng Khe is the project manager for maintaining the traffic light system under the Land Transport Authority.[\[note: 42\]](#Ftn_42) He prepared the traffic light sequence reports in relation to the First Occasion (Exhibit P8) and the Second Occasion (Exhibit P9). The traffic light system was connected to a central computer system, and this system determined the timing of the traffic lights based on the traffic volume condition of the Junction at the material time.[^43] He testified that on both occasions, there were no records of malfunctioning traffic lights at the Junction.[^44]

23     The accused objected to the admission of both reports. His main objections were that he did not understand the document and did not know how to ask PW5 questions,[\[note: 45\]](#Ftn_45) and did not see the relevance of PW5’s evidence.[^46] This was despite the fact that PW5’s evidence was interpreted in Mandarin. He also stated that he would not accept the documents unless “it is translated into Chinese characters because then \[he could\] understand”.[^47] After hearing submissions from the Prosecution and inviting reply submissions from the accused, I ruled that both reports were admissible and admitted them accordingly. The accused declined to cross-examine PW5. He said that he did not “want to get unconcerned party involved in this, they are innocent”.[^48]

### Go Ahead

24     PW6 Wilson Yeoh Wei Sheng is the Accident Prevention Manager in Go Ahead. He testified that the accused was a bus captain employed by Go Ahead from October 2020 to May 2021.[\[note: 49\]](#Ftn_49)

25     PW6 identified the accused as the driver of the First Bus on the First Occasion.[\[note: 50\]](#Ftn_50) He determined this by checking the company’s telematics system. He explained that each bus was fitted with the telematics system.[^51] Each bus captain was issued with a unique RFID tag, which the system would sense and record that they were the driver whenever they boarded the bus.[^52] In addition, the company also verified that the accused was the driver by retrieving the onboard CCTV footage from the camera that was facing the driver’s cabin.[^53]

26     Using the same approach of checking the telematics system and CCTV onboard camera footage, PW6 confirmed that the accused was the driver of the Second Bus on the Second Occasion.[\[note: 54\]](#Ftn_54)

27     PW6 testified that he was aware of the alleged offences on both occasions.[\[note: 55\]](#Ftn_55) The company received the traffic summons letter requesting for the driver’s particulars.[^56] As the company’s appointed officer for such matters, PW6 furnished the accused’s particulars via the e-service system.[^57] He also informed the accused of the alleged offences and showed the accused the relevant onboard CCTV camera footage. He testified that he met the accused for this purpose around December 2020 for First Occasion and around 10 February 2021 for the Second Occasion.[^58]

28     During cross-examination, PW6 testified that at the accused’s request, PW6 used the accused’s mobile phone to take photographs of PW6’s computer screen that was showing CCTV footage from the onboard bus camera (“Screenshots”; see Exhibits D2 and D3).[\[note: 59\]](#Ftn_59) He agreed that he helped accused with his first appeal to the Traffic Police, as well as in making a request to view the evidence.[^60]

### Investigations

29     PW7 Richard Khoo Kok Min is an investigating officer attached to the Traffic Police. He was assigned to follow up with this case for trial preparation.

30     Following the accused’s request for further details on the time interval between the sequential images (see paragraphs 9 and 21 above), Exhibits P11 and P12 were admitted through PW7.[\[note: 61\]](#Ftn_61) PW7 testified on how these exhibits corresponded to each other and pointed out that the timestamp of each sequential image was visible at the top left-hand corner of each enlarged image.[^62]

31     In PW7’s assessment, the offences of failing to conform to the traffic red light signal were made out based on pages 2, 3 and 4 of Exhibit P11,[\[note: 63\]](#Ftn_63) as well as pages 3, 4 and 5 of Exhibit P12.[^64]

32     PW7 also screened the vehicle licence plate number by reference to page 2 of P2 and P5. He conducted vehicle ownership screening using LTA’s system for the First Bus as of the First Occasion.[\[note: 65\]](#Ftn_65) According to the screening document (Exhibit P13), the owner was Go Ahead.[^66] He also screened the vehicle ownership of Second Bus as of Second Occasion.[^67] The screening document showed that the owner was also Go Ahead (Exhibit P14).[^68] The accused objected to the admission of both screening documents on the basis that it was the first time he had sight of the document and the witness was unable to specify the exact date when he obtained the document.[^69] I ruled that the documents were admissible and admitted them accordingly.

33     At the close of the Prosecution’s case, the accused elected to make a submission of no case to answer. After considering the parties’ submissions, I found that there was some evidence, not inherently incredible, which satisfied each and every element of the charges. Accordingly, I called the accused to enter his defence to the charges.

## The Defence’s case

34     The accused elected to testify in his own defence. He was the sole witness for the Defence. In brief, the accused’s case was that he did not beat the red light on both occasions. As far as I was able to distil from his evidence and submissions, there are four main threads to his defence.

35     First, the accused contended that the Prosecution has not produced photographic evidence and video footage of him beating the red light on both occasions.[\[note: 70\]](#Ftn_70) He also took issue with the Prosecution’s witnesses because they were not eyewitnesses to the alleged offences.[^71] He was of the view that a non-eyewitness could “tell stories from the pictures”.[^72]

36     Second, the accused challenged the accuracy of some of the documentary evidence that the Prosecution is relying on. He asserted that the images in Exhibits P2 and P5 were taken at night. In his view, this was apparent from “the reflection of the light, because the headlight of the vehicles would create some form of reflection on the signs”. [\[note: 73\]](#Ftn_73) He also stated that the timestamps and time periods stated by the Prosecution in relation to Exhibit P11 kept changing and questioned if it was believable that the traffic light signal could change over one second.[^74]

37     Third, the accused relied on the Screenshots that PW6 had taken at the accused’s request.[\[note: 75\]](#Ftn_75) The Screenshots were admitted through PW6 as Exhibits D2 and D3. Under cross-examination, the accused testified that PW6 played the CCTV footage on PW6’s computer.[^76] When PW6 saw the traffic light signal colour change, PW6 pressed the keypad to pause the footage and capture the Screenshots.[^77] The Screenshots showed the vehicle number, date and timing clearly.[^78] The accused relied on them to show that on both occasions, the traffic light turned red after the bus already crossed the stop line. With respect to Exhibit D2, he said that according to the “three seconds” principle, the light just turned red in the third image.[^79]

38     Fourth, with respect to the First Charge, he relied on two photographs of a bus bearing the vehicle licence plate SG5078G (_ie_, the same vehicle registration number as the First Bus), which were collectively admitted as Exhibit D7, to show that the bus he was driving was different from the bus captured in the images in Exhibits P1 and P11. He testified that the buses in Exhibits P1 and D7 had different colours and there was no advertisement at the back of the bus in Exhibit D7 unlike the bus in Exhibit P1.[\[note: 80\]](#Ftn_80) While he confirmed that he drove the bus with the vehicle registration number SG5078G, he denied that the bus he drove was the one pictured in Exhibits P1 and P11.[^81]

39     In the course of his defence, the accused tendered several notices and letters that he received from the Traffic Police (see Exhibits D1, D4, D5, D6, D8 and D9). When I invited the accused to elaborate on what the bundle of documents in Exhibit D9 showed, he stated that he did not understand English and did know what were the contents of the letters that were sent to him by the Traffic Police.[\[note: 82\]](#Ftn_82) He also tendered two documents entitled “Transcript of CCTV footage” (see Exhibits D10 and D11). In respect of the latter documents, he testified that he received them via registered post, together with Exhibits D5 and D6, but did not know who sent them to him.[^83] He did not elaborate on Exhibits D10 and D11.

## Analysis of the evidence

40     At the close of the Defence’s case, the Prosecution tendered closing submissions. A hard copy of these submissions was provided to the accused. An adjournment was granted for the accused to prepare his closing submissions. At the adjourned hearing, I heard the accused’s closing submissions and the Prosecution’s reply submissions. Thereafter, I delivered oral judgment setting out the brief reasons for my decision. I now reproduce my oral judgment and elaborate with fuller reasons where necessary.

41     As a preliminary matter, to address the accused’s argument that there was no photographic evidence and video footage of him beating the red light, I wish to state that evidence that is presented in court may assume different forms. It may be eyewitness testimonies, testimonies by formal witnesses regarding how documents were generated and retrieved, or documentary evidence such as photographs or video footages. The Court ultimately decides based on relevant evidence before the Court whether the charges are made out.

42     Having reviewed the evidence and submissions before this Court, I accepted the Prosecution witnesses’ evidence. I found that the Prosecution has proven through its witnesses and exhibits tendered that the accused had failed to conform to the traffic red light signal on both occasions.

43     I found that the enlarged version of the sequential images showed that on both occasions, the traffic light signal had already turned red before the respective bus approached the stop line and that the respective bus was driven across the stop line while the traffic light signal was still red. This is clear from the sequential images set out at pages 3 to 5 of both Exhibits P11 and P12.

44     I did not find any basis to the accused’s claim that Exhibits P2 and P5 were taken at night. The illuminated road signs and the vehicle licence plates was consistent with the use of flash photography. Conversely, the accused’s argument that the reflection of the light on the road signs was created by the headlights of the buses would not explain the illuminated road signs that were visibly behind or further away from the headlights.

45     I next turned to the accused’s argument that the Prosecution’s timestamps and time periods in relation to Exhibit P11 kept changing and that it was unbelievable that the traffic light signal could change over one second. There were some discrepancies among the Prosecution’s witnesses on the total time taken for all nine of the sequential images to be taken. Under cross-examination, PW1 testified that the sequential images in Exhibit P1 were taken within one second,[\[note: 84\]](#Ftn_84) PW3’s evidence was that it would be captured in more than one second,[^85] and PW4’s evidence was that it was more than one second but less than three seconds (see paragraph 21 above). However, these discrepancies were not crucial to the Prosecution’s case. As stated above, it was clear from Exhibits P11 and P12 that the traffic light signal had changed to red before the buses were driven across the Junction. I also inferred from PW5’s evidence that the timing of the traffic light was based on the traffic volume condition at the material time (see paragraph 22 above) that there was no fixed interval between the traffic light signals. PW5’s evidence was not challenged by the accused.

46     I then turned to the Screenshots. Based on the timestamps at the bottom right-hand corner of each Screenshot, there were lapses of two to three seconds between each Screenshot. Save for the accused’s testimony on how PW6 captured the Screenshots (see paragraph 37 above), there was no evidence on what transpired between each Screenshot. It was therefore unclear from the Screenshots when exactly the traffic light signal turned from amber to red. In this regard, the accused sought to rely on the “three seconds” principle to support his case that the traffic light had just turned red in the third Screenshot in Exhibit D2, which was three seconds after the preceding Screenshot. Given my finding that there were no fixed intervals between the traffic light signals, I was not satisfied that the traffic light had first turned red at the timestamp shown in the third Screenshot.

47     Moreover, I noted that the Screenshots showed a view from the front of the buses. The location of the bus relative to the stop line could not be determined from the Screenshots. PW6 testified that the onboard camera was mount-fitted in the centre of the bus above the driver’s view and showed a field of view that started from one car-length ahead of the bus.[\[note: 86\]](#Ftn_86) He also clarified that anything within one car length, including road markings, would not be captured by the onboard camera.[^87] His evidence was not challenged by the accused in cross-examination. Based on PW6’s evidence, the Screenshots would show a frontal view that was further ahead than where the buses actually were. It followed that even if the stop line was no longer visible in the Screenshots, it did not mean that the buses had crossed the stop line, as the accused seemed to suggest.

48     I next turned to the accused’s claim that the First Bus was not captured in the traffic light sequential images. As stated above, he relied on the photographs in Exhibit D7 to show that the bus appeared different from the bus captured in Exhibits P1 and P11. I made two observations. First, the accused testified that these photographs were taken on 9 March 2021,[\[note: 88\]](#Ftn_88) which is about 14 weeks after the First Occasion and six weeks after Second Occasion. He stated in cross-examination that he did not drive the bus at the time when the photographs in Exhibit D7 were taken and that it was a different bus service number.[^89] Second, the accused cross-examined PW6 on whether the bus pictured in Exhibit D7 belonged to Go Ahead. PW6 answered that it was a bus with the licence plate number SG5078G and that the logo on the bus belongs to Go Ahead.[^90] However, the accused did not cross-examine PW6 on whether the bus pictured in Exhibit D7 was the same bus as that pictured in the traffic light sequential images. Neither did the accused put his case that the First Bus was not the one captured in the traffic light sequential images to PW6.

49     For the foregoing reasons, I did not find that the accused’s defence raised a reasonable doubt on the Prosecution’s case. I found that the Prosecution proved both charges against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I convicted the accused of both charges.

## Antecedents

50     The accused is untraced.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed punishment

51     The prescribed punishment for a first-time offender under s 131(2)(_a_) of the RTA is a fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or to both.

### Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

52     The Prosecution stated that the usual tariff imposed where the accused person claimed trial was a fine of $800. For this case, the Prosecution sought the usual tariff, which amounted to a global fine of $1,600 for both charges. The Prosecution did not seek a disqualification order against the accused.

### Mitigation

53     The accused declined to mitigate. He stated that he would be filing an appeal against the conviction and that he was of the view that the prosecution was “baseless”.[\[note: 91\]](#Ftn_91)

### Decision on sentence

54     I took into account that the accused had no antecedents. There was also an absence of aggravating factors. I was of the view that the usual tariff fine was appropriate. Accordingly, the accused was sentenced to a fine of $800, in default three days’ imprisonment, for each charge. The total fine imposed was $1,600, in default six days’ imprisonment.

55     A stay of execution of the sentence was granted on the accused’s application, pending the outcome of the appeal. The accused is currently on bail pending appeal.
