\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9033/2021/01.\]

9 March 2021

### District Judge Brenda Tan:

## Introduction

1       This is an appeal against sentence by the accused, Lange Vivian, a 24-year-old female Singaporean. She pleaded guilty to five charges. One charge was for an offence of carrying on the business of a payment service without a licence under s 5 of the Payment Services Act 2019 (“PSA”). The remaining four charges were for committing acts of harassment by splashing paint and attaching debtor’s note on the door, on behalf of unlicenced moneylenders with common intention under s 28(1)(b) punishable under s 28(2)(a) and s 28(3)(b)(i) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap. 188) (“MLA”) read with s 34 of the Penal Code (“the harassment charges”). She admitted and consented to six other similar harassment charges to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

2       I sentenced the accused to four weeks’ imprisonment for the PSA charge and 13 months’ imprisonment for each of the harassment charges. I ordered the PSA charge and two of the harassment charges to run consecutively thus making a total sentence of 26 months’ and four weeks’ imprisonment. The accused is dissatisfied with the sentence for the PSA charge and is appealing against it. She is not appealing against the sentence for the harassment charges. She is presently serving her sentence.

3       As the accused is only appealing against the sentence for the PSA charge, I shall confine my grounds of decision to the PSA charge.

## The PSA charge

4       The PSA charge read as follows:

>     MAC-904624-2020 (exhibit C5)

>     You … \[Lange Vivian\] … are charged that you, between 27 February 2020 and 28 February 2020, in Singapore, carried on the business of providing payment service in Singapore, namely, a digital payment token service, to wit, by providing to an unidentified person known to you as “Agen Addie”, service of dealing in Bitcoin, a digital payment token, by buying Bitcoin amounting to a total value of SGD2,780, in exchange for SGD278 being commission of 10% of the transacted monetary value, while you did not have in force a licence that entitles you to do so and you are not an exempt payment service provider in respect of providing a digital payment token service, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 5(1) and punishable under Section 5(3)(a) of the Payment Services Act 2019.

## The statement of facts

5       The accused admitted to the statement of facts without qualification. The relevant portion of the statement of facts (“SOF”) relating to the PSA charge is reproduced below:

> 1.    The accused is Lange Vivian, a 24-year-old female Singapore citizen bearing NRIC no.: XXX.

>     …….

>      Facts pertaining to the 11th charge (MAC-904624-2020)

> 28.    Sometime in late February 2020, the accused came across a job advertisement listed on the platform Facebook Marketplace by a user named “Agen Addie”. The job scope was to receive monies in her bank account, make bank transfers and use the monies to buy Bitcoin as instructed by “Agen Addie”, for a commission at 10% of the transaction amount. The accused contacted “Agen Addie” to express her interest in the job and communicated with “Agen Addie” over WhatsApp messages.

> 29.    “Agen Addie” claimed to operate a company called “Gagetworld” and told the accused that he was based in Malaysia and needed someone with a Singapore bank account to receive monies from customers who purchase items from him, and to help him transfer the monies from his Singapore customers to his Bitcoin wallet using physical Bitcoin machines.

> 30.    The accused agreed to take on the job from “Agen Addie” in exchange for the commission of 10% of the transaction amount. “Agen Addie” then explained to the accused that he needed the accused to provide two bank accounts in order to avoid raising suspicion from the banks when there are too many transactions in one bank account in one day. The accused gave “Agen Addie” her POSB account number XXX and DBS bank account number XXX in order to receive monies for the job.

> 31.    From 27 to 28 February 2020, the accused carried on the business of providing a payment service in Singapore. Pursuant to her agreement with “Agen Addie”, the accused received 13 inward transfers into these two bank accounts from 27 February to 28 February 2020 amounting to S$3,350:

![]([2021] SGMC 0011_Image/[2021] SGMC 0011_image1.png)

> 32.    On 27 and 28 February 2020, based on instructions provided by “Agen Addie”, the accused withdrew a total of S$2,780 from the monies she received as cash and proceeded to a physical Bitcoin machine located at Lucky Plaza, 68 Orchard Road #01-59, in Singapore and made multiple purchases of Bitcoin. The accused used the cash to purchase an equivalent amount’s worth of Bitcoin through the Bitcoin machine, and scanned a QR code sent to her by “Agen Addie” in order to transfer the Bitcoins to a Bitcoin wallet as instructed by “Agen Addie”. “Agen Addie” sent the accused a different QR code linked to a different Bitcoin wallet, for each Bitcoin purchase she executed on his instructions. At the request of “Agen Addie”, the accused deleted the WhatsApp conversation history between them from her phone after every Bitcoin purchase she made.

> 33.    Bitcoin is a digital payment token as defined under Section 2 of the Payment Services Act 2019, being a digital representation of value that is expressed as a unit, that is not denominated in any currency, is not pegged by its issuer to any currency, is intended to be a medium of exchange accepted by a section of the public as payment for goods or services, and can be transferred, stored or traded electronically.

> 34.    Under the First Schedule of the Payment Services Act 2019, “digital payment token service” includes any service of dealing in digital payment tokens, and “dealing in”, in relation to any digital payment token, means the buying or selling of that digital payment token in exchange for any money or any other digital payment token (whether of the same or a different type).

> 35.    Therefore, by providing the service to “Agen Addie” of dealing in Bitcoin, in buying Bitcoins amounting to a total of S$2,780 in exchange for S$278 being commission at 10% of the transacted monetary value, the accused has carried on a business of providing a payment service in Singapore, namely, a digital payment token service.

> 36.    The accused does not have a licence that entitles her to carry on the business of providing a digital payment token service in Singapore and is not an exempt payment service provider of digital payment token services either.

> 37.    S$2,200 of the $3,350 received in the accused’s bank accounts has been established to be proceeds of crime transferred to the accused’s bank account by three victims of e-commerce cheating scams:

>> a.    Divya Aryal lodged a police report on 28 February 2020 at Whampoa Neighbourhood Police Post (“NPP”), stating that she had been cheated into making bank transfers amounting to a total of S$550 to the accused’s DBS account, in relation to her online purchase of a Google Pixel 3 mobile phone listed on the “Shopee” mobile application by a user named “worldgadgetss”.

>> b.    Lopez Christina Nacion lodged a police report on 28 February 2020 at Ang Mo Kio Division Headquarters, stating that she had been cheated into transferring a total of S$300 to a bank account, in relation to her online purchase of a Nintendo Switch device and two games listed on the “Shoppee” mobile application. Police investigation established this bank account to be the accused’s POSB account.

>> c.    Lee Kanghwi lodged a police report on 6 March 2020 at Bukit Timah NPP, stating that he had been cheated into transferring a total of S$1,350, in relation to his online purchase of an LG Television on the website “Lazada”. Police investigation established this bank account to be the accused’s POSB account.

> 38.    The accused’s DBS and POSB bank accounts were seized by the Police on 29 February 2020 after police reports were lodged on 28 February 2020 in connection to this case. The accused has deducted a total of S$220 from the monies received in her two bank accounts as part of her commissions from “Agen Addie” and she has spent this amount. S$350 of the balance amount of S$351.02 remaining in the accused’s POSB bank account, had been transferred by one of the victims, Lee Kanghwi.

> 39.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 5(3)(a) of the Payment Services Act 2019 (No. 2 of 2019).

## Prescribed punishment for the PSA charge

7       The punishment for carrying on the business of a payment service without a licence under s 5(1)(a) of the PSA is set out in s 5(3)(a) of the PSA which prescribes a fine not exceeding $125,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both.

## Issues before the court

8       The Prosecution argued that an imprisonment term was warranted for the PSA charge and submitted for at least four weeks’ imprisonment. The Defence contended that a fine of between $10,000 to $15,000 would suffice and that the custodial threshold had not been crossed.

9       The court therefore had to determine whether a custodial term was warranted for the PSA charge and if so the appropriate length of the custodial sentence.

## Legislative background

10     It would be relevant to set out the legislative background behind the PSA. The PSA was enacted on 14 January 2019 to streamline payment services under a single legislation by consolidating the Money-changing and Remittance Businesses Act (Cap 187, 2008 Rev Ed) and the Payment Systems (Oversight) Act (Cap 222A, 2007 Rev Ed) and to take into account new developments in financial technology (“FinTech”) by expanding the scope of regulated payment services[^1]. The PSA empowers the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”) to regulate payment services to address the following key risks and concerns[^2]:

> (a)     loss of customers’ moneys such as when a service provider becomes insolvent;

> (b)     money-laundering and terrorism financing;

> (c)     fragmentation and limitations to interoperability across payment solutions; and

> (d)     technology including cyber risks

11     The PSA provides for two parallel regulatory frameworks[^3]:

> (a)     a designation regime that enables MAS to designate systemically important payment systems and regulate the operators and institutions of these payment systems for financial stability and efficiency;

> (b)     a licencing regime which is activity-based that enables MAS to regulate retail payment services provided to customers and merchants.

12     The PSA regulates seven payment services which are: i) account issuances, ii) domestic money transfers, iii) international money transfers, iv) merchant acquisition, v) money-changing, vi) e-money issuance and vii) digital payment token (see First Schedule to the PSA). E-money issuance and digital payment token services (more commonly known as cryptocurrency dealing or exchange services) fall under the expanded scope of the licencing regime to encompass services associated with virtual assets and currencies[^4]. Offences under s 5 of the PSA would come under the licencing regime.

13     Thus, the PSA came into force on 28 January 2020 to enhance the regulatory framework for payment services in Singapore, increase consumer protection and raise confidence in the use of e-payments.

## Different legal interests protected by the PSA and the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act

14     For a better understanding of the objectives behind the PSA, the Prosecution had helpfully set out the different legal interests protected by the PSA and the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act, Cap 65A (“CDSA”)[^5]. The CDSA is concerned with the movement of criminal proceeds and deterring money-laundering activities. On the other hand, the PSA is concerned with preventing an unregulated shadow financial system, irrespective of whether criminal proceeds are involved or not. In this regard, I agreed with the Prosecution that where there were criminal proceeds involved for PSA offences, it would be an aggravating factor because money laundering was one of the key risks which the PSA was intended to address.

## First prosecution under s 5 of the PSA

15     The accused committed the offence in the PSA charge between 27 and 28 February 2020, about a month after the PSA came into effect. The Prosecution informed the court that this was the first prosecution for an offence under s 5 of the PSA and there was no available sentencing precedent.

## Prosecution’s proposed five-step sentencing framework

16     In the interest of maintaining sentencing consistency for PSA offences, the Prosecution proposed a two-stage, five-step sentencing framework for offences under s 5(3) of the PSA, modelled after the sentencing framework laid down by the High Court in _Logachev Vladislav v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 609</span> for s 172A(2) of the Casino Control Act (Cap 33A, 2007 Rev Ed). Briefly, the five steps were as follows:

> (a)     Step 1: Identify the offence-specific factors that went towards culpability and harm;

> (b)     Step 2: Identify the applicable indicative sentencing range having regard to the prescribed sentencing range;

> (c)     Step 3: Identify the appropriate indicative starting point within the indicative sentencing range in step 2;

> (d)     Step 4: Adjust the indicative starting point to account for aggravating and mitigating factors;

> (e)     Step 5: Adjust further, if necessary, to take into account the totality principle.

17     In connection with step 2, the Prosecution came up with the following indicative sentencing matrix for first-time offenders who claimed trial to offences punishable under s 5(3) of the PSA:

![]([2021] SGMC 0011_Image/[2021] SGMC 0011_image2.png)

18     After applying its proposed sentencing framework, the Prosecution took the view that the present case involved slight harm and medium culpability which would place the indicative sentencing range at a high fine and/or up to 1.5 year’s imprisonment (as shaded in the table above).

19     In its final analysis, the Prosecution submitted that the present case fell under the low end of the indicative sentencing range and that a sentence of at least four weeks’ imprisonment was warranted.

## The sentencing submissions by the Defence

20     The Defence submitted that a sentencing framework should not be promulgated for offences under s 5 of the PSA at this stage due to a lack of precedents and the various ways in which such offences could arise and the resulting effects. The Defence argued that precedents for licencing offences under the now repealed Money-changing and Remittance Businesses Act (Cap 187, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MCRBA”) remained useful references. Having regard to the MCRBA precedents where mostly fines were imposed, the Defence submitted that a fine in the range of S$10,000 to S$15,000 was appropriate in this case. Notwithstanding that the Defence was seeking a fine, counsel informed the court that the accused would not be able to pay the fine and he urged the court to impose a default sentence of up to two weeks which he submitted would be proportionate. Alternatively, counsel submitted that the court could impose a short custodial sentence on the premise that the accused was genuinely unable to pay the fine and in doing so, the court should articulate its reasoning clearly. Counsel further proposed that the court could impose a very short custodial sentence like three days’ imprisonment and a fine of $10,000 in default two days’ imprisonment.

## Sentencing considerations

### Deterrence was the primary sentencing principle

21     Given the legislative intent behind the PSA to address the increased risks of money laundering and terrorism financing brought about by new financial technologies like digital payment token services which might be used to facilitate illicit anonymous and borderless transactions, I was of the view that the dominant sentencing principle in this case would be that of deterrence.

### Sentencing factors

22     As regards to the sentencing framework suggested by the Prosecution for PSA offences, I was of the view that the High Court would be a more appropriate forum to establish such a framework. I therefore declined to adopt the Prosecution’s proposed framework. My preferred approach to sentencing the accused for the PSA charge was to consider her culpability and the harm caused by having regard to the offence-specific factors and offender-specific factors. I found the following sentencing factors to be relevant in the present case:

## Reasons for imposing a four weeks’ imprisonment term

23     I was of the view that a four weeks’ imprisonment term was appropriate on the facts of this case for the following reasons.

### 1) The offence involved money laundering with a transnational element

24     Over a two-day period, a total of $3,350 from 13 bank transfers was deposited into the accused’s POSB and DBS bank accounts. Out of the sum of $3,350, 70% or a sum of $2,200 was later ascertained to be criminal proceeds. The accused withdrew $2,780 to buy Bitcoin. The Defence argued that the amount withdrawn was not substantial. In my view, the more crucial consideration was the fact that the funds were tainted. This was not a case of pure provision of payment services without a licence which would have rendered the offence regulatory in nature. Quite the contrary, the very money laundering risk which the PSA was intended to address had presented itself in this case. The criminal proceeds formed a significant amount of the funds received in the accused’s accounts (70%) and there was a transnational element involved because Agen Addie was based in Malaysia and the accused was executing Agen Addie’s instructions from across the border.

25     The Defence pointed out that it was not clear how much of the criminal proceeds of $2,200 were represented in the sum of $2,780 which the accused withdrew to transact for the Bitcoin. Hence, the Defence stressed that the accused should not be held liable for having dealt with the entire criminal proceeds of $2,200 as part of the $2,780 which she used to buy Bitcoin. Suffice it for me to say that I only had regard to the fact that 70% of the total funds of $3,350 received by the accused were criminal proceeds.

### 2) It was a sophisticated offence

26     It was not disputed that there was some level of sophistication employed in the commission of the offence. The accused provided two bank accounts to Agen Addie for the purpose of receiving funds. She later withdrew the cash, went to a physical Bitcoin machine where she made multiple purchases of Bitcoin. She then scanned a different QR code for each transaction so that she could transfer the Bitcoin to a different Bitcoin wallet. The Prosecution pointed out that the effect was to convert fungible cash to Bitcoin, a digital payment token, with no feasible way to trace the moneys. The Prosecution highlighted that in Bitcoin scams, it was likely that the perpetrators would split the Bitcoin through more wallet addresses before consolidating the funds and using an anonymous service to hide the source of the Bitcoin wallet. By breaking up the links between the Bitcoin transactions, the accused had helped Agen Addie to mask the trail of the victims’ moneys that went into the accused’s accounts to the Bitcoin wallets of the perpetrators. In this regard, the Defence contended that the sophistication employed in the commission of the offence pertained to the sophistication of the criminal enterprise rather than the accused’s conduct.

27     I was of the view that while the accused did not come up with the elaborate plan, she had played a critical role in the scheme of things. She was instrumental in facilitating the receipt of dubious funds and diverting them into cryptocurrency, making the offence more difficult to detect. She was also savvy enough to understand and execute an advanced/novel form of FinTech payment service.

### 3) The accused took steps to avoid detection

28     According to the SOF (see \[5\] above, sub paras 30 and 32), when the accused accepted the job from Agen Addie, Agen Addie had explained that he required the accused to provide two bank accounts so as to avoid raising suspicion from the banks when there were too many transactions in one bank account in one day. Subsequently, the accused also heeded Agen Addie’s instructions to delete the WhatsApp conversation history between them from her phone after each Bitcoin purchase. The Prosecution submitted that the accused’s conduct suggested at the very least a wilful blindness on her part to the criminality of the arrangement. The Defence acknowledged that there was “an element of evasion”[^6] but argued that wilful blindness was not the same as actual knowledge and that the accused did not have actual knowledge of the predicate offence.

29     It was not the Prosecution’s case that the accused had actual knowledge of the predicate offence. The Prosecution’s contention was that the accused would have been alerted by Agen Addie’s suspicious requests that the arrangement was not legitimate. In this regard, I did not agree with the Defence that the accused was a victim herself, believing that she had been working for a genuine business enterprise. The red flags were there but the accused chose to ignore them, failed to make any inquiries and obeyed Agen Addie’s instructions blindly. I accepted that at the lowest level, the accused had acted recklessly in the circumstances by complying readily with a new foreign job master whom she had not met to take steps to avoid detection of their activities.

### 4) A deterrent sentence was necessary

#### Specific Deterrence

30     I took into account the accused’s early plea of guilt. She was 24 years of age at the time of sentencing. She committed the offences in the harassment charges and PSA charge when she was about 23 years old. According to her Mitigation Plea (exhibit D1), she used to live with her elderly adoptive parents and siblings. She later moved out to stay on her own to be self-reliant and not be a burden to her adoptive parents. Her highest educational qualification was a NITEC in medical manufacturing. She had worked in various jobs including warehousing logistics and waitering. She was facing financial difficulties as well as physical and psychiatric health issues such as hypertension and adjustment disorder and was receiving counselling for her depression and suicidal tendencies. Her medical conditions however did not have any causal or contributory link to her offences.

31     I noted that despite her relatively young age, the accused was not a first offender. She committed four counts of theft previously and was granted probation in 2015 when she was about 19 years old. Regrettably, she breached her probation order soon after and her probation order was revoked three months later, and she was sentenced to fines for the theft charges. She managed to stay on the straight path for a few years but in 2019, she committed 10 counts of harassment charges within the month of May. These were the same harassment charges which were dealt with before me together with the PSA charge. The accused was charged in court for the harassment charges in September 2019. She was released on bail. While her harassment charges were pending, she committed the PSA charge in February 2020. This was an aggravating factor. She also profited from the PSA charge as she earned 10% commission of $278 for buying $2,780 worth of Bitcoin. In this regard, although the PSA charge was committed over only two days, it would be noted that the offence came to light when the scam victims lodged police reports and the police swiftly seized the accused’s bank accounts. It was not a case where the accused stopped offending of her own initiative. There was also no restitution.

32     The circumstances therefore called for specific deterrence so that the accused could learn her lesson and not re-offend.

#### General Deterrence

33     There was strong public interest in deterring money laundering services, a key risk which the PSA was intended to tackle due to rising scams including online scams in Singapore[^7]. The Prosecution pointed out that in the early half of 2020 alone, S$82 million had been lost by victims in Singapore, a 97.1% increase as compared to the amount lost in 2019. It had also become prevalent for persons in Singapore to be involved as money mules in such scams. On 12 September 2020, the Singapore Police Force announced that following a two-week island wide operations, it was investigating 261 persons for more than $3 million lost to scams. The Prosecution stressed that it only took seconds to transfer funds out but once the moneys left the trackable and traceable banking system, it would take massive resources including engaging foreign enforcement agencies to try to trace and recover the moneys. Hence, I agreed that a deterrent sentence was necessary in this case to deter like-minded persons who were lured by easy money from even contemplating venturing anywhere near such a job arrangement.

34     On the facts of this case, I was of the view that a four weeks’ imprisonment would achieve both specific and general deterrence and befitting of the crime.

35     I shall now deal with the MCRBA precedents cited by the Defence to support its position that a fine would serve as adequate deterrence for the PSA charge. The precedents were for offences either under s 5 of the MCRBA for carrying on unlicenced money-changing business or under s 6 of the MCRBA for carrying on unlicenced remittance business. The Prosecution submitted that the MCRBA precedents should not be relied on as a starting point for PSA offences for two main reasons. First, s 5(3) of the PSA targeted a wider mischief than the offences under s 5 and s 6 of the MCRBA. Secondly, the punishments prescribed had been enhanced, manifesting Parliament’s intent to take a more deterrent stance towards the PSA offences as compared to the MCRBA offences in the past. The punishments under the MCRBA used to be “a fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment not exceeding 2 years or to both and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a fine not exceeding $10,000 for every day during which the offence continues after conviction”. The punishment had been increased under s 5(3) of the PSA to “a fine not exceeding $125,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not exceeding $12,500 for every day or part of a day during which the offence continues after conviction”.

36     Since the present case was the first prosecution under s 5(3) of the PSA, I agreed with the Defence that the MCRBA precedents could provide some useful reference but bearing in mind that the punishment had since been enhanced.

37     The Defence tendered five MCRBA precedents and I was the presiding judge in three of the cases. Of the five precedents, three precedents were in respect of s 5 of the MCBRA for an offence of carrying on the business of money-changing without a licence. In _PP v Ziyaudeen_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGDC 399</span>, _Ziyaudeen_ was convicted after trial and sentenced to a fine of S$4,000. He had carried out nine money-changing transactions between 22 and 28 Aug 2010 in Singapore and Hong Kong involving FJ$456,000 and HK$850,000. His profit was $10,000. In _PP v Fazal Mohamed s/o N M A R Mohamed Ebrahim_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGDC 326</span>, _Fazal Mohamed_ continued to operate a money-changing business on 1 August 2011 and 25 September 2011 after the licence was cancelled. He was sentenced to a fine of $10,000. In _PP v Ng Ah Ghoon_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 184</span>, I was the presiding judge and I had imposed a fine of $10,000 on _Ng Ah Ghoon_ who had carried on unlicenced money-changing business from 2013 to February 2015. The transactions were voluminous involving 25 different customers, with a total of S$1,256,880 collected.

38     It would be noted that the three precedents above were regulatory in nature and did not involve tainted funds. They therefore did not support the contention of the Defence that a fine would be adequate in the present case where the circumstances were more aggravating.

39     The remaining two precedents relied upon by the Defence in submitting for a fine were prosecutions under s 6 of the MCRBA for carrying on a remittance business without a licence. I was the presiding judge for both cases. In _PP v Nguyen Thi Thanh Dong_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGDC 339</span>, _Nguyen Thi Thanh Dong_ pleaded guilty to three charges including an offence under s 6 of the MCRBA for carrying on an unlicenced remittance business from early 2010 to March 2012. I had imposed a fine of $15,000 in respect of this charge. _Nguyen Thi Thanh Dong_ subsequently appealed against the sentence in relation to her immigration offence. My grounds of decision therefore only dealt with the immigration offence.

40     The last precedent was _PP v Abdul Bashar Khan_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 203</span> where I had convicted _Abdul Bashar Khan_ after a trial and sentenced him to 3 months’ imprisonment and a fine of S$50,000 in default 2 months’ imprisonment for a s 6 MCRBA offence. _Abdul Bashar Khan_ had entered into a business arrangement whereby he allowed his sole proprietor account to receive funds from overseas. Thereafter he withdrew the cash, travelled to a licenced remittance agency and deposited the cash into accounts maintained with the remittance agency. _Abdul Bashar Khan_ received a total of S$1,536,285.26 from April to September 2012 in his business account and he carried out at least 17 transactions of cash withdrawal and transfer to the remittance agent totalling S$862,272. He earned a commission of about $52,731.26 for his part in the arrangement. It turned out that $679,198.42 of the moneys received in _Abdul Bashar Khan’s_ account were criminal proceeds as the moneys belonged to six foreign investors who had been duped into transferring their moneys into _Abdul Bashar Khan’s_ business account. In sentencing _Abdul Bashar Khan_, I stated at \[50\] of my grounds of decision as follows:

>     …..While I recognized that Mr Bashar was not directly involved in the fraud that was committed on the victims and their losses, nonetheless he had played a pivotal role in the transfer of the funds. It was also aggravating that the quantum of funds transferred was huge and that Mr Bashar had also profited handsomely from it. To achieve the deterrent effect, indeed it would not be enough to impose a fine alone to disgorge Mr Bashar of his illegal profits. A custodial sentence would be necessary. However, given that Mr Bashar was not implicated in the syndicate, I thought that the 6 months’ imprisonment which the Prosecution wanted was on the high side.

41     On appeal, the High Court affirmed _Abdul Bashar Khan’s_ conviction but reduced the imprisonment term from 3 months to 6 weeks while upholding the fine of $50,000 which I had imposed to disgorge _Abdul Bashar Khan_ of his illicit earnings.

42     The Defence contended that if _Abdul Bashar Khan_ had received six weeks’ imprisonment when there were more victims and the amounts involved were much higher than the present case, then the custodial threshold could not have been crossed in the present case yet the Prosecution was submitting for four weeks’ imprisonment here.

43      _Abdul Bashar Khan’s_ case could be easily distinguished. I agreed with the Prosecution that the parties in _Abdul Bashar Khan_ were operating within the banking systems where there would be records. _Abdul Bashar Khan’s_ case also employed the simple means of withdrawing funds from one account and depositing or transferring them into another bank account which were traceable. Conversely, in the present case, an alternative system involving Bitcoin was used which bypass the official banking channels making tracing impossible. There was the additional aggravating feature here where the accused took steps to evade detection of her actions which was not found in _Abdul Bashar Khan’s_ case. _Abdul Bashar Khan’s_ case fortified my conclusion that a four weeks’ imprisonment was justified in the present case.

## Conclusion

44     For the reasons I have stated above, I was satisfied that on the facts of this case, a custodial sentence was warranted and that a term of four weeks’ imprisonment would be appropriate.

45     The accused is presently serving her sentence.
