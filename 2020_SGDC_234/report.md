### District Judge Carol Ling Feng Yong:

## Introduction

1       The Accused was a director of Royal Automative Pte Ltd (“RAPL”), a company in the business of importing and selling cars. He claimed trial to three charges under section 420 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224, for deceiving three customers of RAPL into believing that RAPL was able to fulfil their orders for cars, thus inducing them to hand over various sums of money to RAPL.

2       The charges are set out below:

> **_DAC 922721/2017_**

> are charged that you, on 10 December 2016, at Royal Automotive Pte Ltd (“RAPL”) located at 31 Woodlands Close, #01-28, Woodlands Horizon, Singapore, being a director of RAPL, did cheat a customer of RAPL called Mohamed Rashid Bin Mohamed Yusoff (“Rashid”), through an RAPL sales representative called Ayim Ismail Milne, to wit, by deceiving Rashid into believing that RAPL was able to fulfil Rashid’s order for a car, which fact you knew to be false and, by such manner of deception, dishonestly induced Rashid to deliver property, to wit, $20,000, to RAPL, and you have committed an offence punishable under section 420 of the Penal Code.

> **_DAC 922722/2017_**

> are charged that you, between 27 December 2016 and 13 February 2017, at Royal Automotive Pte Ltd (“RAPL”) located at 31 Woodlands Close, #01-28, Woodlands Horizon, Singapore, being a director of RAPL, did cheat a customer of RAPL called Mohd Amir Bin Rahaman (“Amir”), through an RAPL sales representative called Ayim Ismail Milne, to wit, by deceiving Amir into believing that RAPL was able to fulfil Amir’s order for a car, which fact you knew to be false and, by such manner of deception, dishonestly induced Amir to deliver property, to wit, $12,000, to RAPL, and you have committed an offence punishable under section 420 of the Penal Code.

> **_DAC 922723/2017_**

> are charged that you, between 7 January 2017 and 10 February 2017, at Royal Automotive Pte Ltd (“RAPL”) located at 31 Woodlands Close, #01-28, Woodlands Horizon, Singapore, being a director of RAPL, did cheat a customer of RAPL called Sallehuddin Bin Zainuddin (“Sallehuddin”), through an RAPL sales representative called Ayim Ismail Milne, to wit, by deceiving Sallehuddin into believing that RAPL was able to fulfil Sallehuddin’s order for a car, which fact you knew to be false and, by such manner of deception, dishonestly induced Sallehuddin to deliver property, to wit, $20,000, to RAPL, and you have committed an offence punishable under section 420 of the Penal Code.

3       At the conclusion of the trial, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him on all three charges. He was sentenced to a total of 18 months’ imprisonment. The Accused now brings this appeal against both his conviction and sentence. He is currently on bail.

## Undisputed Facts

4       These key facts were undisputed:

> (a)     RAPL was a company in the business of importing and selling cars;

> (b)     The Accused was the director, sole shareholder[^1] and “sole owner”[^2] of RAPL, who was very much involved in the daily running of the company as “_boss_” of the company”[^3];

> (c)     The staff in RAPL took instructions from the Accused; RAPL salesmen were not allowed to sell cars without the Accused’s knowledge[^4];

> (d)     PW4 Ayim Ismail Milne (also known as “Naim”) was an RAPL car sales representative employed by RAPL, who acted entirely on the instructions of the Accused, in dealing with customers of RAPL. The Accused was Ayim’s “_boss_”;

> (e)     PW4 Ayim dealt with customers PW1 Mohd Amir Bin Rahaman, PW2 Mohamed Rashid bin Mohamed Yusoff and PW3 Sallehuddin Bin Zainuddin, entirely on the instructions of the Accused;

> (f)     These three customers (hereafter referred to collectively as “victims”) all signed sales agreements with RAPL for the purchase of a Honda Vezel, through PW4 Ayim, in the period between December 2016 to January 2017;

> (g)     In reliance on the representation that RAPL would be able to deliver the cars to the victims, the victims handed over various amounts of monies to RAPL, as deposits and/or part-payment for the purchase of their cars;

> (h)     At the time when the sales agreements were entered into, RAPL was in financial difficulties;

> (i)     To date, no cars have been delivered to any of these three victims.

5       It was clear from the evidence that the Accused was the controlling mind of RAPL; he made the decisions in respect of RAPL. In addition, the conduct and actions of RAPL, through its car sales representative PW4 Ayim, were directly attributable to the Accused, since PW4 Ayim acted entirely on the instructions of the Accused. This was undisputed by the Accused.

## The Prosecution’s Evidence

### PW1 Mohd Amir bin Rahaman

6       PW1 is one Mohd Amir Bin Rahaman (hereafter referred to as “Mr Amir”), a police officer who was attached to Home Team Academy in charge of senior officers’ training at the time of the offence.

7       Mr Amir testified that sometime in November 2016, when he was “_cruising_” at a business building known as Woodlands Horizon, he chanced upon the company RAPL at the corner[^5]. Upon his enquiry, RAPL confirmed that they were selling the Honda Vezel. Subsequently, over a few visits to RAPL in which Mr Amir dealt with a salesman known as “Ayim” (confirmed to be PW4 Ayim Ismail Milne; “hereafter referred to as Ayim”), Mr Amir, who found the selling price of the Honda Vezel offered by RAPL to be cheap, eventually paid the initial deposit of $5,000 for the car on 27 December 2016, after he returned from his holiday.

8       Mr Amir further informed the Court that he went down to RAPL several times to enquire if the deal “_can be expedited_”. At some point, Ayim then told Mr Amir that he (Ayim) had been told by “_his boss_” to bid for the Certificate of Entitlement (COE) for Mr Amir’s car. That gave the assurance to Mr Amir that he was going to get the car very soon. Ayim further informed Mr Amir that if he (Mr Amir) was fine with getting a blue Honda Vezel that was a display vehicle in the showroom, Ayim would be able to expedite the deal. On those assurances, Mr Amir decided to hand over a second payment of $7,000. He hoped that with the additional deposit, it would “_inspire Ayim to process it faster_”[^6]. Ayim told him that he “_will try to expedite the thing_”[^7].

9       A week later, Mr Amir went to the RAPL showroom but discovered that it was closed. He thought nothing of it. However, when he returned a few days later, the showroom remained closed. That was when Mr Amir enquired with another car showroom nearby. He was told by a male Indian that “_one night, uh, they saw the staff came to collect all the s---stuff and after that, locked up the office. He did not know where they went_”[^8]. Pursuant to his discovery, Mr Amir then sent queries to Ayim which were initially not responded to. Subsequently, Ayim replied saying that he had no knowledge of the company closing down[^9].

10     The sales agreement relating to the purchase of the Honda Vezel by Mr Amir at $94,888 was marked and admitted as Exhibit P2. The sales agreement confirmed that an initial deposit of $5,000 was paid on 27 December 2016 and the second payment of $7,000 was made on 13 February 2017, both in the form of cheques. Both these payments were corroborated by entries in RAPL bank statements[^10]. The estimated delivery of the car was stated in the sales agreement to be May to June 2017.

11     Mr Amir testified that he did not make a police report in respect of this matter. In his mind, it could be cheating but could also be a breach of an agreement[^11]. It was his evidence that in this entire transaction, Mr Amir dealt with Ayim from RAPL; the Accused was only introduced to Mr Amir as “_the boss of the company_”[^12].

### PW2 Mohamed Rashid Bin Mohamed Yusoff

12     The second customer of RAPL was PW2 Mohamed Rashid Bin Mohamed Yusoff (hereafter “Mr Rashid”), previously a police officer and also a former colleague of Mr Amir. He was introduced to RAPL by Mr Amir.

13     Mr Rashid was informed by Mr Amir that RAPL was having a promotion for the Honda Vezel before Christmas. This was in 2016. Mr Rashid and Mr Amir then went down to the RAPL showroom where they were approached by Ayim, the sales representative on duty at that time. They made some enquiries relating to the promotion. A week later, Mr Rashid returned to the RAPL showroom. This was when he confirmed the deal with Ayim and also made a down payment of $20,000 for the car. He was told by Ayim that the $20,000 would be used for purposes of COE bidding and administrative fees[^13].

14     The sales agreement in respect of Mr Rashid’s purchase of a Honda Vezel (Exhibit P5) confirmed that the price of the Honda Vezel was agreed at $92,000 and that payment by cheque of a sum of $20,000 was made on 20 December 2016. The estimated delivery of the car as stated in the sales agreement was May - June 2017.

15     Subsequently, Mr Rashid visited RAPL a third time to check on the progress of his purchase and spoke to Ayim. Sometime around middle or end of January 2017, after failing to respond to Mr Rashid’s messages, Ayim eventually informed Mr Rashid that he had already left RAPL. As Mr Rashid felt something was not right, he decided to go down to RAPL. It was then that he found out that the company had already closed[^14]. This was sometime in end of January or early February 2017.

16     Like Mr Amir, Mr Rashid only dealt with Ayim in the entire transaction[^15]. He eventually lodged a police report when advised to do so by the police. The police report, admitted and marked as Exhibit P4, was filed on 4 April 2017 wherein Mr Rashid described how he had gone to RAPL on 10 December 2016 to purchase a Honda Vezel.

### PW3 Sallehuddin Bin Zainuddin

17     PW3 Sallehuddin bin Zainuddin (hereafter “Mr Sallehuddin”) was the third customer involved with RAPL in the period of January 2017. At the time of the offence, he worked in the marine industry.

18     Mr Sallehuddin was browsing through Carousell (an online platform) when he noticed an advertisement selling a Honda Vezel, by RAPL. Prior to seeing the advertisement, Mr Sallehuddin had never heard of RAPL. He began chatting with a sales representative, one “Naim” and he was informed that the price for the car was $102,000. There is no dispute that “Naim” was Ayim.

19     On 7 January 2017, Mr Sallehuddin drove down to the RAPL showroom. He noticed many cars there and to him, it was a “_proper set up_”[^16]. At RAPL, he met up with Ayim who then informed him that a sum of $20,000 was needed as a deposit for the car. A sales agreement (Exhibit P7) was signed. The sales agreement confirmed that the price of the Honda Vezel was $100,000. The estimated delivery was indicated as February – March 2017. Thereafter, Mr Sallehuddin asked to meet with “_Naim’s boss_” since he was going to make payment in cash[^17].

20     Mr Sallehuddin then met the Accused. He handed $8,000 cash to the Accused and also made a transfer of $2,000 into RAPL’s account that day. It was Mr Sallehuddin’s evidence that he made it clear to the Accused that he wanted the car within a month or as soon as possible[^18]. On that request, the Accused stated he could “_do that without any problem…and that it was quite possible because he got stock_”. The Accused also promised to apply for a loan for Mr Sallehuddin the “_next following week_”[^19].

21     Subsequently on 10 January 2017, Mr Sallehuddin received a message from Ayim, saying that “_my boss request you to pay another $10,000 in order to proceed with the COE_”[^20]. Subsequently, Mr Sallehuddin handed a cash cheque of $10,000 to Ayim at the office. According to the police report dated 22 February 2017 (Exhibit P6) lodged by Mr Sallehuddin, this cash cheque was handed over to Ayim on 10 February 2017.

22     About a week after the second payment of $10,000 was made, Mr Sallehuddin went down to the RAPL showroom only to find it empty, except for one or two phones in a cubicle, with a huge printout saying “we are closed”. Mr Sallehuddin met with no success as he tried to search for answers[^21]. The staff in RAPL had all gone missing[^22].

23     When Ayim responded several days later and informed Mr Sallehuddin that he had resigned from RAPL, he asked Mr Sallehuddin to liaise with one “Ifah”. When Mr Sallehuddin contacted “Ifah”, she informed him that she was unable to contact the Accused and she did not even know where the Accused was. Instead of getting a refund of his monies as he hoped, “Ifah” requested another $10,000 from Mr Sallehuddin in order for them to proceed with the COE[^23]. Mr Sallehuddin flatly refused, feeling “_100% cheated_”[^24]. In court, Mr Sallehuddin was visibly affected by the incident.

### PW4 Ayim Ismail Milne

24     PW4 Ayim Ismail Milne (hereafter referred to as “Ayim”), known as Naim as well, is a cousin of the Accused. The Accused invited him to join RAPL as a car salesman[^25]. Prior to working in RAPL, Ayim had no experience in selling cars[^26]. The only training he received was from the other two salesman working in RAPL, one Mr Chua and one Mr Shan[^27]. In court, Ayim identified the Accused as his “_boss_”[^28]. The Accused was the one who ran the company[^29].

25     Ayim testified that sales agreements will have to be finalised with the Accused who would approve it by signing on the overleaf of the sales agreement, by the right of Ayim’s signature above “Sales Advisor”[^30]. From Ayim’s testimony, it was evident that the Accused had full control of how the business in RAPL was run and what sales take place in RAPL.

26     Ayim confirmed that he dealt with PW1 Mr Amir, PW2 Mr Rashid and PW3 Mr Sallehuddin as customers when he was working as a car sales representative in RAPL for the period of November 2016 to February 2017. In respect of the sales agreements entered into with the three victims, even though Ayim was the sales representative, he testified that the Accused was the one who decided when the vehicle could be delivered[^31], what price the vehicle was to be sold at[^32] and even the colour of the car[^33]. These were unchallenged by the Accused. Ayim further corroborated Mr Sallehuddin’s account that he (Mr Sallehuddin) had made cash payments directly to the Accused on 7 January 2017. Further, all monies received by Ayim from the three victims were handed over to the Accused.

### PW5 Toh Yong Sian Alfred

27     PW5 Toh Yong Sian Alfred (hereafter referred to as “Inspector Toh”) was the officer assigned to carry out investigations against RAPL after numerous reports had been lodged against the company for failing to deliver the cars which they ordered. This involved about 40 customers[^34]. Inspector Toh’s investigations began sometime in early November 2016.

28     The bank statements of RAPL (Exhibit P3) were adduced through Inspector Toh. Inspector Toh highlighted entries in these bank statements which corresponded to cheque payments made by the three victims. There was also a record of a cash deposit of $8,000 on 9 January 2017 as well as a NETS payment after the cash deposit of $8,000 – amounts identical to what was paid over to the Accused in cash and through NETS by PW3 Mr Sallehuddin on 7 January 2017. In any case, there was no dispute by the Accused that the monies handed over by the three victims to RAPL as initial or down payment for the cars, were received by RAPL.

29     Contrary to what the Accused asserted when he came on to the stand, Inspector Toh informed the Court that he did not tell the Accused that it was “_up to him_” to decide whether to continue the business or not[^35]. Inspector Toh testified that after the police began investigations into RAPL, the Accused was advised not to take in any new customers until he managed to settle all the outstanding dealings. However, even after such police intervention, Inspector Toh discovered that there were three “_new customers_” - the three victims in this case[^36].

30     Other than the bank statements, these pieces of evidence below were also admitted through Inspector Toh:

> (a)     A voice recording between the Accused and one Chua Peng Jun – Exhibit P11, which was handed to Inspector Toh by the Accused. Chua Peng Jun was a sales representative in RAPL who allegedly embezzled RAPL monies;

> (b)     Transcript of the voice recording – Exhibit P12. I did not find the voice recording or the transcript particularly helpful to the issues in this case; it mainly showed that Chua Peng Jun, an RAPL salesman had taken money from RAPL customers.

> (c)     Three statements of the Accused, recorded on 9 November 2016 (Exhibit P13); 29 March 2017 (Exhibit P14) and 2 May 2017 (Exhibit P15). The voluntariness in the giving of these police statements were not challenged by the Accused. I will refer to the statements in greater detail in the course of these written grounds.

## The Accused’s Defence

### DW1 The Accused

31     The Accused’s defence was essentially that he had no intention to cheat the three victims; that RAPL’s failure to deliver the cars to the victims was due to the writ of seizure and sale issued against RAPL (Exhibit D2) which forced RAPL to wind up.

32     The Accused chose to give evidence. He testified that sometime in November 2016, RAPL faced great financial difficulty when a salesman of RAPL was “_caught cheating_” the company of about $600,000. RAPL continued with operations from November 2016 to February 2017. The Accused asserted that RAPL was operating as normal after November 2016 and confirmed that RAPL had three new sales in the period from November 2016 to February 2017, referring to the deals closed in respect of the three victims. The Accused explained that the cars would be delivered to them only between May to June 2017 because RAPL needed to clear the backlog of orders, on a first come, first served basis. However, on 14 February 2017, RAPL received a writ of seizure and sale, taken out by one of the customers whom the said Chua Peng Jun had cheated. RAPL was ordered to close the company and everything which belonged to RAPL was seized by the court, resulting in the non-delivery of cars[^37]. Accused stated that had it not been for the writ of seizure and sale, RAPL would have been able to deliver the cars.

33     In the course of his testimony, the Accused produced these following documents:

> (a)     A screenshot of an invoice of the stock purchased from Coral Net, RAPL’s car suppliers in Japan, dated August 2016 (Exhibit D1); the original document was not produced;

> (b)     A writ of Seizure and Sale against RAPL (Exhibit D2);

> (c)     A bill of lading (Exhibit D3) received on 30 July 2016 from Coral Net, RAPL’s supplier in Japan, which according to the Accused, showed that RAPL already bought six cars from Japan and that the cars were already in the port in Singapore[^38]. I did not find this document entirely relevant as this document pre-dated the purchase of the vehicles by the three victims;

> (d)     A one-page screenshot of an un-dated document, showing the stock which RAPL had as at (Exhibit D4). The original document was not produced in Court and the Accused explained that the original document could be with the police;

> (e)     A screenshot of a WhatsApp chat between the Accused and one Eddie from Sin Thai Hin Motor and Credit Private Limited (hereafter “Sin Thai Hin”) on 7 November 2017 (Exhibit D5). Sin Thai Hin was the company which extended credit facilities to RAPL and the said Eddie was the person in charge of RAPL’s account in Sin Thai Hin.

34     The content and evidential value of some of the exhibits above will be discussed in greater detail in the course of these grounds.

### DW2 Sharifah Lubna Binte Syed Salleh

35     DW2 Sharifah Lubna Binte Syed Saleh (hereafter “Ms Sharifah”) was the staff doing the accounts in RAPL. She described that once a customer agrees to purchase a car from RAPL, a deposit will be paid. For the balance payment relating to the purchase of the car, a loan from the finance company would be applied for. Once the loan is approved, the finance company would pay out the balance due on the purchase of the car[^39]. When shown the sales agreements of the three victims, Ms Sharifah stated that with the payment process described above, RAPL would be able to deliver the cars to the three victims[^40].

36     In her evidence, Ms Sharifah was able to confirm that she did order the cars as listed in Exhibit D4 from local suppliers but she was unable to recall which time period the ordering was for[^41]. She could also confirm that she had made out payment to Luxury Auto before but again, she was unable to recall for how many cars she had made the payment for[^42] and if the payment was for the cars relating to the sales agreements of the three victims. However, similar to the Accused, she confirmed that the cars were ordered on a “_first come and first out basis_[^43]”.

## Ingredients of an offence under section 420 of the Penal Code

37     For an offence of cheating under section 420 of the Penal Code to be made out, three elements have to be fulfilled. These were set out in the case of _Gunasegaran s/o Pavadaisamy v Public Prosecutor_ \[1997\] 2 SLR 969:

> (a)     The victims must be deceived; deception must have been practised on the victims;

> (b)     The deception must have induced the victims to deliver any property to any person;

> (c)     There must be a dishonest intention on the part of the Accused to induce the victims to deliver the property.

38     In _Chua Kian Kok v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 1 SLR(R) 826</span> and reiterated by the court in _Public Prosecutor v Ong Eng Teck_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGHC 242</span> at \[22\], the first two elements of the _Gunasegaran_ formulation addressed the actus reus of the offence, while the third element addressed the mens rea.

39     In convicting the Accused, I scrutinized the evidence before me in respect of these three elements. I shall deal with each of these elements in turn.

## Were the victims deceived?

40     The first element of “deception” pertains to inducing a person to believe to be true something which is in fact false[^44].

### False representation made

41     Here, the victims were led to believe that the Honda Vezels they ordered would be delivered to them. This was apparent on the face of the sales agreements signed where the estimated delivery of the cars were indicated to be within a definite period. However, as the Prosecution put it[^45], the undisputed evidence presented in this court showed that RAPL would not be able to fulfil the orders for the cars for the following reasons:

> (a)     It was undisputed that at the material time, RAPL was in dire financial straits and had difficulty delivering cars to RAPL customers who had ordered their cars earlier. The situation was explained in the Accused’s police statement given on 9 November 2016 (Exhibit P13). The Accused also confirmed this when he gave evidence.

> (b)     In November 2016, the police had already begun investigations into RAPL as by then, there were about 40 customers who had lodged police reports against RAPL for not delivering their cars. It was in this period of time that RAPL was advised not to take in any more new customers since there was already a large backlog of orders to be fulfilled;

> (c)     In his police statement Exhibit P15, the Accused confirmed that as at February 2017 (after the orders of the three victims had been taken in by RAPL), the finance company Sin Thai Hin still had not agreed to provide financial support to RAPL and RAPL was also still negotiating with a local dealer Luxury Auto to supply vehicles[^46].

42     I agreed with the Prosecution that given the evidence before the court, RAPL did not have the ability to deliver the cars to the three victims as was represented to them. For PW1 Mr Amir, he was assured that he would get the car “_very soon_”[^47] since PW4 Ayim informed Mr Amir that he had been told by the Accused to bid for the COE for Mr Amir’s car. It was because of what was said to him that Mr Amir decided to make the second payment of $7,000 in the hope that that would “_inspire Ayim to process it faster[^48]_”. For PW3 Mr Sallehuddin who requested for the car to be delivered within a month, the Accused personally informed Mr Sallehuddin that it was “_quite possible because he got stock_”[^49]. That cannot be true, given the state RAPL was in at that time.

43     Even if one may argue that the estimated delivery of the cars was indicated on the sales agreements as being “May-June 2017”, the undisputed fact remained that as at February 2017, RAPL had not managed to find financial support; they did not even have a supplier willing to provide cars to them and this precarious situation had not even taken into account the huge backlog of orders of earlier customers waiting to be fulfilled.

44     On the evidence before me, I found that the representation made to the victims as to RAPL’s ability to deliver their cars to them, was false. It did not matter that for PW1 Mr Amir and PW2 Mr Rashid, the representation as to RAPL’s ability to deliver the cars was not made to them directly by the Accused, but through PW4 Ayim, RAPL’s sales representative. Explanation 3 of section 415 of the Penal Code states:- “_Whoever makes a representation through any agent is to be treated as having made the representation himself_”. In the case _Rahj Kamal bin Abdullah v Public Prosecutor <span class="citation">\[1997\] 3 SLR(R) 227</span>, it was state_d by the court at \[26\]:

> _I was of the view that the element of deception can be satisfied without a direct and personal representation. A fraudulent or dishonest representation can be made directly or indirectly. Such a representation made through a person acting as agent for the accused amounts to fraudulent or dishonest representation by and on behalf of the accused. Where there is evidence to show that the accused had authorised another to act on his behalf, the false representation can be made the basis for convicting the accused._

45     In any case, it was undisputed that the Accused was behind the actions of RAPL and PW4 Ayim had conveyed information to the three victims, based on the instructions of the Accused.

### Dishonest concealment of facts

46     It was further stated in _Rahj Kamal bin Abdullah at \[24\]:_

> _The natural and ordinary meaning of the word “deceiving” is causing another to believe what is not true. Such misrepresentation can be by way of words, acts and even omissions. As Explanation 1 to s 415 makes clear, a dishonest concealment of facts is a deception within the meaning of the section._

47     I also found that there was dishonest concealment of RAPL’s financial situation to the three victims at the material time. It bears repeating that it was undisputed as well as the Accused’s own evidence that from November 2016, RAPL faced great financial difficulty and was dealing with a backlog in delivery of cars to earlier customers. However, this fact was not made known to the three victims.

48     All three victims had no previous association or dealings with RAPL such that they might be aware of what was going on in RAPL at the time when they purchased their vehicles from RAPL:

> (a)     PW1 Mr Amir had chanced upon RAPL when he was in the vicinity;

> (b)     PW2 Mr Rashid heard about RAPL when Mr Amir informed him that RAPL was having a car promotion;

> (c)     PW3 Mr Sallehuddin was browsing through Carousell when he noticed RAPL advertising the sale of the Honda Vezel. That was the first time he had come across the company; he knew nothing about RAPL prior to seeing the advertisement.

49     In short, all three victims were completely unfamiliar with RAPL and its financial state before they entered the business premises to make enquiries about the Honda Vezel.

50     At the time when the victims entered into sales agreements to purchase their Honda Vezels, they remained unaware that RAPL was in huge financial difficulty and faced a serious problem delivering cars to at least 40 customers who had lodged police reports by then. These facts were never made known or fully made known to the victims at any time:

> (a)     The clear evidence from PW2 Mr Rashid and PW3 Mr Sallehuddin was that prior to them signing the sales agreement, neither of them was aware of the financial situation of RAPL or that RAPL was behind in fulfilling their orders from earlier customers. Both Mr Rashid and Mr Sallehuddin testified that they were not informed by PW4 Ayim or the Accused of the dire financial situation RAPL was in. They had not read any adverse report in the newspaper about RAPL or seen any social media posting about RAPL.

> (b)     As for PW1 Mr Amir, he testified that prior to dealing with the company, he had no idea that an RAPL salesman had cheated RAPL customers. However, before signing the sales agreement, a friend sent him a whatsapp message about how RAPL was not delivering cars. Mr Amir testified that he went back to Ayim who told him that the company was recovering and assured him that the company would be able to honour their promise[^50]. In Mr Amir’s case, even if he was alerted about the situation of RAPL, it did not appear from the evidence that he was fully apprised of the financial woes of RAPL or was he informed of the gravity of the situation facing RAPL at that stage; it was sufficiently camouflaged by the assurances of Ayim.

51     The Accused asserted that the three victims knew of the situation RAPL was in. PW4 Ayim testified that the three victims had asked about the situation of the company because they had seen a posting on Facebook. He stated that he did not give them any assurances but told them that the company was _“trying to gain back the customers and find more customers to cover the loss_”[^51].

52     I preferred the testimonies of the three victims over the bare assertions of PW4 Ayim and the Accused. Having scrutinized the testimonies of the three victims, I found them to be honest witnesses, forthright in their evidence. I did not sense or notice any tendency on their part to embellish details relating to their encounter with RAPL, PW4 Ayim or the Accused, or the events leading up to the signing of the sales agreements.

53     Further, given the high cost of purchasing a vehicle in Singapore, I found it difficult to accept that any customer would enter into a sales agreement to buy a car with RAPL despite knowing the financial trouble RAPL was in and how RAPL had a large number of outstanding car orders yet to be fulfilled. The cost involved in the sales agreements for the purchase of a Honda Vezel by the three victims in this instance was not less than $92,000, a huge amount by any measure, and these deals required down payments in excess of $10,000. For two of the victims, they handed over $20,000. As PW2 Mr Rashid put it: “_If Ayim had informed me that, I don’t think I will make a deal, that’s it. Simple as that[^52]”._ Similarly emphasized by PW3 Mr Sallehuddin, he stated in evidence that if he had known that the company was in trouble, he would “_definitely not_” have entered into the transaction. He would not commit because “_why would \[he\] put himself at risk_?”[^53] The testimonies of these victims were logical and entirely consistent with the thought process of any reasonable person looking to purchase a new car. Even for PW1 Mr Amir, he received assurances from PW4 Ayim before he proceeded to conclude the deal with RAPL.

54     If RAPL’s financial situation had been fully disclosed to the three victims, they would not have been too surprised when they subsequently arrived at RAPL’s showroom to find it vacated. However, they were caught completely off-guard. All of the three victims, PW1 Mr Amir included, had to find out for themselves belatedly that RAPL’s business had been wound up, the showroom was no longer functioning and that they had been left stranded, after their efforts to contact Ayim proved futile. The unsettling state of affairs compelled police reports to be filed by PW2 Mr Rashid and PW3 Mr Sallehuddin eventually.

55     On the facts, I was satisfied that there was a dishonest concealment of the true state of affairs of RAPL by the Accused, who had full control over the business of RAPL and the conduct of Ayim, his sales representative. In failing to disclose the dire financial situation of RAPL to the three victims prior to them signing the sales agreements which led to payments made consequent to the sales agreements, the three victims were deceived into believing that RAPL would be able to fulfil their orders for their cars.

## Did the deception induce the victims to deliver property to the Accused?

56     On this element of the charge, I had no difficulty finding that the answer to this question must be in the affirmative. Almost all the victims testified that had they known that RAPL was in financial trouble or was facing a situation where they could not deliver cars to earlier customers, they would not have entered into the transaction to purchase the Honda Vezel from RAPL. They relied on the representation that RAPL would be able to fulfil their orders for a Honda Vezel and thus handed over monies as a deposit, down payment or part-payment towards the purchase of the car.

57     In this instance, the straightforward nature of the transaction also speaks for itself. The three victims signed sales agreements with RAPL for the sole objective of acquiring a brand new Honda Vezel. There was no other reason motivating them to enter into such a business transaction with RAPL. Because the three victims were deceived into believing that RAPL was able to fulfil their orders for a Honda Vezel, the victims were induced to deliver monies at various times over to RAPL, pursuant to the sales agreements they each signed:

> (a)     PW1 Mr Amir handed over two payments, amounting to a total of $12,000;

> (b)     PW2 Mr Rashid handed over a single payment of $20,000;

> (c)     PW3 Mr Sallehuddin handed over a total sum of $20,000.

58     I was satisfied that the deception induced the three victims to deliver monies to the Accused.

## Was there a dishonest intention on the part of the Accused to induce the victims to deliver the monies?

59     Having found that deception was practised on the three victims which induced them to hand monies over to the Accused, the next crucial question was whether there was a dishonest intention on the part of the Accused to induce the victims to deliver the monies. As stated in _Gunasegaran_ at \[44\], this would constitute the mens rea for the offence and related substantially to the definition of “cheating” in section 415 of the Penal Code.

60     The Accused asserted that RAPL had the ability to fulfil the car orders of the three victims and that there was no dishonest intention on his part to induce the three victims to deliver the monies to him. He stated that he could have delivered the cars to them as agreed, if his business had not been shut down. A large part of the Accused’s defence was that RAPL’s failure to deliver the vehicle to the three victims was merely a breach of a contract, not cheating.

### Distinction between a breach of contract and cheating

61     In _Rahj Kamal bin Abdullah at \[30\], it was recognised that:_

> _The distinction between a case of mere breach of contract and one of cheating depends upon one vital factor: whether at the time of the agreement there is intention on the part of the accused to carry out the terms of the agreement, as is clear from illus (g) to s 415. In this regard, dishonest intention, if any may be inferred from the surrounding circumstances and the subsequent conduct of the Accused._

### Dishonest intention may be inferred from the surrounding circumstances and the subsequent conduct of the Accused.

62     This approach in inferring the dishonest intention from the surrounding circumstances and the subsequent conduct of the offender, was taken by the court in _Gunasegaran_.

#### The case of Gunasegaran s/o Pavadaisamy v Public Prosecutor

63     The headnotes in the case described the facts of _Gunasegaran_ as these: The appellant Guna was working as a mechanic in a company. He was approached by the victim Suzuki who was working in the same company and who wanted to buy a car. Guna sold Suzuki a second-hand car for $60,568, inclusive of the insurance and transfer fee for the car. Suzuki paid Guna for the car and the car was delivered to him together with a receipt acknowledging payment. Guna also did not give to Suzuki the car’s logbook and lied to Suzuki that the logbook system was no longer in use in Singapore. A year later, Suzuki confronted Guna about the logbook. Guna admitted he did not transfer the car to Suzuki’s name, and had used it to borrow money. Guna undertook to pay back the moneys and return the logbook but did not do so. In February 1996, the car was towed away on account of arrears in payment of a loan taken out with the car. Suzuki then realised that his car was mortgaged to ESH Credit Pte Ltd (“ESH”) and that his signature had been forged to obtain the loan from ESH using his car as a mortgage. Guna blamed all of these acts on one Ramachandran, and even claimed that the latter absconded with the money.

64     As outlined in \[48\] of the case, one of the arguments on appeal was that dishonesty or fraud, should be assessed before or at the time Suzuki (PW1) parted with his money. When Suzuki paid the appellant, there was nothing to suggest that the appellant had intended not to transfer the car into Suzuki’s name and thus the appellant could not be guilty of either dishonest or fraudulent intention on his part.

65     The appellate court rejected the argument. At \[49\], the court stated:

> _I found this contention completely untenable. In my judgment, the actions of the appellant before PW1 handed over the money for the car had to be construed in conjunction with the actions of the appellant after the car had been sold. In other words, while the appellant’s dishonest or fraudulent intentions had to be considered before PW1 was induced to part with his property, such intentions could also be inferred with the aid of subsequent events which occurred after PW1 had parted with his money. Although the acts and intentions of the appellant before PW1 had paid for the car were unhelpful, in that they could not be used specifically to show that the appellant was dishonest or fraudulent, an analysis of the appellant’s subsequent actions could and should be considered to shed light on the appellant’s intentions in this respect. In fact, these subsequent actions confirmed the appellant’s dishonesty. For example, using the present case as a scenario, if the appellant pretended to act honestly before he sold the car to PW1, but after it was sold refused to transfer the car into PW1’s name, then, on the basis that only the appellant’s actions and intentions before the car was sold could be taken into account, the appellant could never be guilty of cheating under s 420, since he had acted as if he was honest at all times before the sale of the car. On the other hand, if his actions could be considered post-sale of the car, then it could be inferred that he had the dishonest or fraudulent intention to deceive PW1, but that he acted honestly before that so as to get PW1 to buy the car._

66     At \[50\], the appellate court went on to uphold the district judge’s findings, affirming that she was perfectly entitled to come to her conclusion that the facts of the case, taken as a whole before and after the sale of the car to PW1, pointed to the appellant having a dishonest intention to deceive PW1. The district judge in _Gunasegaran_ had noted that the appellant lied when PW1 asked about the “red book” (the logbook which was an essential document for older cars which recorded ownership) for the car; there was failure by the appellant to disclose that the car was still under hire purchase and the transfer of the car could not be effected until such outstanding payments under the hire purchase scheme for the car had been fully paid and the appellant’s assurances that he could effect the transfer of the car immediately thus turned out to be untrue. Further and more significantly, the appellant took no steps, after PW1 had bought the car, to discharge his hire purchase obligations to Yong Trading.

67     Turning to the facts of this case, I carefully considered the totality of the evidence before me to ascertain the Accused’s state of mind at the material time. Having done so, and based on the prevailing facts at the time that the representations were made as well as the Accused’s conduct after the sale, I was of the view that the Accused’s dishonest intention to induce the victims to deliver the monies may be inferred from these following pieces of evidence:-

#### RAPL was already unable to fulfil the orders of earlier customers at the material time

68     There was no income-generating business being conducted by RAPL at the material time. The objective evidence was that RAPL was already unable to fulfil the orders of earlier customers. This was not a case whereby the Accused was prevented from fulfilling the orders of the three victims. In his police statement recorded on 9 November 2016 (Exhibit P13), the Accused himself admitted the following:

> (a)     From as early as May to June 2016, RAPL was already facing difficulties in fulfilling orders from its customers[^54];

> (b)     Between July 2016 to October 2016, RAPL had already run out of funds to order cars from its suppliers to deliver to RAPL’s customers for the period[^55];

> (c)     In November 2016, Sin Thai Hin, the finance company who had initially agreed to provide finances to RAPL, withdrew financial support for RAPL to the tune of $300,000[^56].

#### The Accused was well-aware that RAPL was not able to deliver cars and was in trouble

69     By November 2016, some 40 RAPL customers had already lodged police reports against RAPL for failing to deliver their cars. As mentioned, PW5 Inspector Toh testified that investigations then began into RAPL’s affairs. He described this as “_police intervention_”. At this point, PW5 Inspector Toh testified that the Accused was advised not to take in any more new customers until he managed to settle all the outstanding dealings[^57]. At that point in time, the Accused was already put on notice. Interestingly, investigations revealed that the orders of the three victims were the only orders taken in after police intervention. The Accused was well-aware of the gravity of the situation and knew exactly what he should not do.

70     In a later police statement recorded on 29 March 2017 (Exhibit P14), the Accused confirmed that the three victims were the only customers RAPL had taken in after police intervention[^58]. He further admitted that RAPL took in the business from the victims despite knowing that RAPL was already facing financial problems in delivering new vehicles to earlier customers in order to generate cash flow “_so as to fulfil the promises and refund of the previous batches_”[^59].

71     Despite knowing the financial state of RAPL and the fact that RAPL was already not delivering cars to many earlier customers, the Accused persisted in taking in the orders of the three victims and represented to them that RAPL would be able to deliver the cars to them.

#### There was no reasonable basis for the Accused to make the representations he did to the three victims at the material time

72     The deals entered into with RAPL by the three victims, based on the representations of the Accused, took place from November 2016 to early February 2017, with the last set of monies from PW3 Mr Sallehuddin handed over on 10 February 2017. It was the Accused’s own admission in his police statement that as at February 2017, even though there appeared to be an understanding between Sin Thai Hin and the Accused that the former could assist to pay for the registration of the vehicles to the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and subsequently deduct the amount from the loan obtained by customers, the fact remained that there was no contract relating to this understanding and Sin Thai Hin had not agreed to provide floor stock to RAPL. The Accused was still liaising with Sin Thai Hin on this matter. At the same time, the Accused was also negotiating with one Mr Ong, the owner of Luxury Auto to allow RAPL to take the vehicle first[^60]. All these negotiations were still on-going at the time or after the order of the last victim, Mr Sallehuddin was accepted.

73     With no formal agreements in place between the Accused and Sin Thai Hin or Luxury Auto even as at February 2017, it was bewildering how Accused could in good faith represent to the three victims in the months preceding February 2017 that RAPL would be able to deliver their cars to them. There was simply no reasonable basis for the Accused to ground a genuine belief that he would be able to deliver the cars the victims ordered, at the time the victims contracted with RAPL[^61].

#### The Accused was unable to show how he was going to honour his financial obligations to the three victims and to secure delivery of the cars

74     The clear evidence was that Sin Thai Hin had withdrawn financial support to RAPL by November 2016. Exhibit D5 - an excerpt of a conversation between the Accused and one Eddie from Sin Thai Hin - clearly showed that. In his statement (Exhibit P13), the Accused further confirmed that as at February 2017, Sin Thai Hin had still not agreed to provide financial support to RAPL and the Accused was still liaising with them.

75     The Accused admitted Exhibit D1 as a confirmation order of the vehicles he would purchase from Coral Net Company Limited. This document was received in May 2016. However, it is the Accused’s own evidence that the balance payment for the ten cars listed in Exhibit D1 depended entirely on Sin Thai Hin providing finance to RAPL[^62]. There was no evidence produced before the court that Sin Thai Hin ever agreed to providing such financial support to RAPL. The Accused asserted that he had agreed with the boss of Sin Thai Hin on an alternative way to “_solve the problem_” i.e. instead of Sin Thai Hin giving $300,000 to RAPL as balance payment for the ten cars listed in D1, they would take the stock (listed in Exhibit D4) from other local dealers and “_contra_” the loan[^63].

76     However, it was significant that throughout his evidence, the Accused failed to produce any formal contract with Sin Thai Hin to corroborate his testimony. In fact, even for the alternative method suggested above, the Accused admitted that there was no evidence between the boss of Sin Thai Hin and himself[^64]. There were no emails or any whatsapp messages with the boss or any employee or officer of Sin Thai Hin, evidencing any agreement between the Accused and Sin Thai Hin, much less a written contract. Other than bare assertions, the Accused had nothing to show for in terms of how he was intending to fulfill his obligations under the sales agreements.

77     Accused claimed that he was negotiating with the owner of Luxury Auto to supply vehicles to RAPL first, without payment. Again, as the Prosecution put it, it was “_just discussions and negotiations_” with Luxury Auto[^65].There was no agreement with Luxury Auto that the cars listed in Exhibit D4 (given in November 2016) would be made available for RAPL’s customers without payment. The Accused failed to produce any evidence of an agreement between RAPL and Luxury Auto that the latter would provide vehicles to RAPL at no charge and would only receive payment later after the customers’ loans were disbursed by the banks.

78     I found the Accused’s assertions of verbal agreements he had with Sin Thai Hin and Luxury Auto to be convenient. No witnesses from Luxury Auto or Sin Thai Hin were called to corroborate the Accused in evidence. No contracts or documents were adduced in evidence.

79     The evidence of DW2 Ms Sharifah was not much of a help to the Accused. It was clear from her testimony that her role in RAPL and her knowledge of what the Accused was doing was limited. She was not privy to any discussions the Accused had with Sin Thai Hin and/or Luxury Auto[^66]. It was clear that Ms Sharifah acted on instructions from the Accused and only received orders from the Accused as to what to do.

#### The monies collected from the three victims were not used for the purpose of fulfilling their orders

80     At the time when monies were handed over by the three victims to RAPL pursuant to the purchase of their Honda Vezels, the reasonable expectation of the victims would be that their monies would be applied towards the fulfillment of their orders, be it to place an order for the car or to bid for the COE. At no time was there disclosure by the Accused to the three victims that their payments to RAPL would be used for any other purpose other than towards the fulfilling of their car orders.

81     For each of these victims, assurance in various forms were given to them that RAPL was working towards the fulfilment of their orders with the monies handed over to RAPL. However, that was far from the truth. For a fact, the monies collected from the three victims did not go towards fulfilling their orders. It was not a situation whereby the Accused had used the monies received from the three victims to bid for their COE or had taken steps to obtain their vehicles, only to find his efforts thwarted by circumstances beyond his control.

82     In his police statement (Exhibit P15), the Accused admitted:

> (a)     For PW1 Mr Amir, the $5,000 which he had handed over on 27 December 2016 was used to register vehicles for existing customers. Both the sums of $5,000 and $7,000 handed over by Mr Amir was used to pay for company overheads and supplier’s accessories[^67];

> (b)     For PW2 Mr Rashid, his deposit of $20,000 was paid to Luxury Auto for the outstanding and balance payment of a vehicle registered for other customers[^68]; and

> (c)     For PW3 Mr Sallehuddin, the deposit received on 7 January 2017 was used for RAPL’s monthly overheads and to pay RAPL’s suppliers[^69].

83     As outlined in their testimonies:

> (a)     PW1 Mr Amir handed over an additional $7,000 in his hope that it would “_inspire Ayim to process it faster_”[^70]. Prior to the handing over of the cheque of $7,000, Ayim had represented to him that the Accused had told Ayim to bid for the COE for PW1’s car which assured him that he was going to get the car very soon. That was not true at all.

> (b)     After making payment of $20,000, PW2 Mr Rashid visited the RAPL office to find out the “_progress of the application_” and was told that it was “_in progress_”[^71]. Once again, that was not true.

> (c)     As for PW3 Mr Sallehuddin, he emphasised to the Accused personally that he wanted his vehicle within a month[^72]. Mr Sallehuddin was informed by the Accused at the time when he purchased the car that it would not be a problem for him (the Accused) to deliver the car within a month; “_quite possible because he got stock_”. This was not true, given that the Accused was facing a huge backlog of orders for cars from earlier customers.

84     In his statement (Exhibit P14), the Accused stated that he allowed his staff to continue to take in new orders despite knowing that RAPL was already facing financial problems in fulfilling the orders of previous batches of customers in order to generate cash flow and to “_refund_” previous batches. The Accused stated that he did not consider how long he could sustain RAPL by rolling in this manner; he just wanted to save his business[^73].

85     The Accused readily and similarly admitted on the stand that the monies received from the three victims was not actually used in relation to their purchases[^74]. It was for the purpose of rolling these monies to fulfil earlier orders that RAPL received from its customers[^75], to pay for company overheads, to pay for salaries, including salary to himself[^76]. In short, the monies received from the three victims were used for every other aspect of the business of RAPL, just not for the purpose which the monies were handed over by the three victims for i.e. for the purchase of their cars.

86     The Accused went on to justify his actions by saying that whatever money RAPL received from the deposit, it was RAPL’s profit. Because it was RAPL’s profit, the Accused was of the view that the money could be used for the business and its expenses and need not be applied towards the purchase of the car for which the money was first paid out for. The Accused further alluded that RAPL had the right to manage the money in any way so long as the car was delivered at the end of the day. In this case, the Accused explained that RAPL did not manage to deliver the car due to the writ of seizure and sale[^77].

87     I was of the view that the Accused’s position may perhaps be acceptable if RAPL was viable as a business at the material time, such that RAPL had the financial freedom to allocate its resources any way it wanted, whilst still processing the orders of new customers. However, the objective evidence presented clearly showed that RAPL was in grave financial difficulties and did not have money to pay its suppliers. At the material time, RAPL was already not able to deliver cars to about 40 customers who had earlier placed orders with RAPL. In this situation, it would not be justifiable at all for the Accused to represent to the three victims that RAPL would be able to fulfil their orders for cars, collect monies from them and then completely disregard RAPL’s obligations under the sales agreements by failing to deploy any of those monies towards processing their orders.

88     By so doing, I found that the Accused had the intention to cause wrongful gain to RAPL at the material time. RAPL was not entitled to receive the funds from the three victims which were not intended to go towards fulfilling their orders for cars. Wrongful loss had also been caused to the victims.

### Accused’s conduct was telling of his dishonesty

89     If the Accused had sincerely thought that he would be able to deliver the vehicles to the three victims within the time stipulated in the sales agreements, there was no reason why he could have explained to them from the outset why it would take that amount of time to deliver the vehicles. There was no evidence coming from the three victims on that count. On the contrary, the victims were given assurances in different forms that their orders would be processed. In particular PW3 Mr Sallehuddin was informed by the Accused at the time when he purchased the car that it would not be a problem for him (the Accused) to deliver the car within a month; “_quite possible because he got stock_”.

90     Further, when matters in RAPL came to a head, RAPL shut its business without giving notice to any of the three victims. The Accused disappeared without a trace and without being accountable to the three victims in respect of the sales agreements they had entered into with RAPL. These were the only customers which RAPL had taken in after police intervened in November 2016 and there cannot be said to have been any oversight, miscommunication or confusion on the part of the Accused viz-a-viz the three victims.

## Decision at Close of Defence’s Case

91     From the surrounding circumstances and the conduct of the Accused, evident in the way he dealt with the monies that he received from the three victims, I found that the Accused had the dishonest intention to induce the victims to hand over monies to him. He could not have reasonably believed that he could fulfil the orders of the three victims or that RAPL had the financial ability to honour the sales agreements at the time they were entered into. At the material time, RAPL was in grave financial difficulties, with tens of earlier orders unfulfilled, disgruntled customers, police reports filed. Despite all that, the Accused represented to the three victims that RAPL could fulfil their orders for cars, thus inducing them to hand over monies to RAPL.

92     The inference to be drawn from the way the Accused dealt with the three victims, the way he managed the monies collected from the three victims was that the Accused intended to close the deals in order to have monies to keep his business alive, not to fulfil the orders of the 3 victims. He intended to cause wrongful gain in this manner to himself and consequently, wrongful loss to the three victims.

93     I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved their case against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt. I thus found the Accused guilty and convicted him on all three charges.

## Antecedents and mitigation

94     Apart from traffic-related offences, the Accused was convicted in 2009 on a charge of cheating by personation under section 419 of the Penal Code where he was imprisoned for three months.

95     The Accused tendered a written mitigation. In it, the Accused pleaded for leniency but maintained that that he did not have the intention to deceive any party. He asked the Court to impose a fine. This was a legal impossibility since an offender convicted of charges under section 420 of the Penal Code would be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to a fine.

## Reasons for the sentence

96     The amount involved in the charges is a key factor for consideration in sentencing[^78]. Citing precedents, the Prosecution submitted that the appropriate sentence on each charge in cases of similar amounts where offenders pleaded guilty, would be in the region of 8 to 12 months imprisonment[^79]. In this case, the amounts in each of the three charges case were $12,000 and $20,000 (2 charges). However, since the Accused claimed trial, he would not benefit from a sentencing discount. The Prosecution was of the view that starting point would be in the region of 12 to 15 months’ imprisonment per charge[^80].

97     The Prosecution further cited _Tan Thiam Wee v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 4 SLR 141</span>. In that case, the offender submitted false invoices under a factoring arrangement in the hope that the sums advanced by the bank would tide his company over its cashflow problems. The High Court distinguished such a case from cases where offences were committed for direct financial gain and proceeded to reduce the sentence in _Tan Thiam Wee_. In light of the fact that there was no direct personal gain accruing to the Accused from his cheating; it was to help RAPL with its financial difficulties, Prosecution submitted that the sentence may be calibrated downwards from the starting point to 10 to 12 months’ imprisonment per charge[^81], seeking a global sentence of at least 22 months’ imprisonment.

98     I found the Prosecution’s suggested range of sentence in respect of the Accused’s charges to be a fair one. I agreed that the motive of the offender in committing the cheating offences was a relevant consideration in sentencing. In this case, the Accused deceived the three victims into believing that RAPL would be able to fulfil their orders for cars and dishonestly induced them to hand over monies to RAPL, in the hope that it would save the business of RAPL and keep it going. He did not cheat the victims with a view to enriching himself.

99     In the circumstances, I imposed the following sentences:

> (a)     DAC 922721/2017 ($20,000) – 10 months’ imprisonment

> (b)     DAC 922722/2017 ($12,000) – 8 months’ imprisonment

> (c)     DAC 922723/2017 ($20,000) – 10 months’ imprisonment

100    As required by section 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, Chapter 65, I ordered the sentences in DAC 922721/2017 and DAC 922722/2017 to run consecutively, making it a total of 18 months’ imprisonment.

101    Having taken a last look at the sentence, I was satisfied that the aggregate sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment was one which was proportional to the offences. The total amount involved in the three charges was a sum of $52,000. There was no restitution made by the Accused at all; none of the victims received the Honda Vezels they ordered from RAPL. It was a total loss for the victims. A measure of specific deterrence was also necessary in this case bearing in mind that the Accused had a relevant antecedent, having been previously convicted of a cheating by personation offence under section 415 of the Penal Code in 2007. Bearing in mind these facts, the global sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment imposed may not be described as manifestly excessive.
