Civil Procedure – Rules of court – Service of process – Setting aside service of writ – Validity period of an amended writ

13 July 2021

### Deputy Registrar Liu Zeming:

1       It is not infrequent that parties may be added or substituted in the course of legal proceedings. This can occur for a variety of reasons, and may take place at any stage. Often, by the time a new party is added, the validity of the original writ for the purpose of service would have expired. In such circumstances, must the claimant first renew the validity of the writ, before service of the _amended_ writ can be properly effected on the _newly added_ party? This was the central question which arose in the present application.

2       The oral hearing took place before me on 5 April 2021. At the end of the hearing, I answered the question in the negative, with oral grounds. Although there was no appeal against this decision, counsel have indicated that a written decision would be useful given the dearth of authorities on this issue. I therefore set out the grounds of my decision here.

## Background to the Application

3       Summons No. 1022 of 2021 (“**Sum 1022**”) was the 1st and 2nd Defendants’ application to set aside the service of the Writ of Summons (Amendment No. 1) (the “**Amended Writ**”) on them. The principal contention was that the service was ineffective because the period for service of the Amended Writ had expired by the time it was served on the two Defendants. In order to understand this contention, a recount of the procedural history is necessary.

4       This present proceedings was commenced on 2 January 2020 by the filing of a writ of summons on 2 January 2020 (the “**Original Writ**”) against one Mr. Chew Poh Huang (the “**Original Defendant**”). Service of the Original Writ was effected on the Original Defendant on 26 June 2020, through service on the Original Defendant’s solicitors who confirmed that they had instructions to accept service of process. A memorandum of appearance was filed by the Original Defendant’s solicitors on the same day service was effected.

5       Subsequently, the Plaintiff was informed that the Original Defendant had in fact passed away on 8 April 2019, _before_ the Original Writ was even _issued_. The Plaintiff took the position that the cause of action nonetheless survived against the estate of the Original Defendant, and the action was validly commenced. On 30 September 2020, the Plaintiff applied to amend the Original Writ to substitute the Original Defendant with the present 1st and 2nd Defendants, who are the co-administrators of the Original Defendant’s estate.

6       Leave to amend the Original Writ was granted on 27 October 2020 by a Deputy Registrar (the “**Amendment Order**”). The amended Writ of Summons (the “**Amended Writ**”) was filed in court on 6 November 2020 and served:

> (a)     on the 1st Defendant on 26 February 2021, by way of substituted service; and

> (b)     on the 2nd Defendant on 19 November 2020, by way of personal service.

> (collectively, the “**Disputed Services**”)

7       By the time of the Disputed Services, the validity period for the _Original Writ_ had expired. Sum 1022 was filed on 9 March 2021 by both Defendants to set aside the Disputed Services.

8       A brief chronology of the relevant events is set out below.

## Parties’ Positions

### The Defendants’ Arguments

9       The Defendants’ main contention was that the Disputed Services ought to be set aside because the Amended Writ was served after its validity period had expired. The Defendants’ case was that the period of validity of a writ runs from the date of its _original_ issuance (i.e. the date the Original Writ was issued), notwithstanding any subsequent amendment. As such, the validity period for the Amended Writ expired on 1 July 2020. The subsequent services on the Defendants were therefore invalid.[^1]

### The Plaintiff’s Arguments

10     The Plaintiff’s position was that insofar as the 1st and 2nd Defendants were concerned, pursuant to O 15 r 8(1)(c) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (the “**ROC**”), the action was deemed to have commenced against them on the date on which the amendment to the Original Writ was made. In other words, the amendment of the Original Writ by adding or substituting any person as a party is equivalent to the issue of a new writ against the newly-added party, and the Plaintiff would have a “_fresh_” 6-month period from the date of the amendment to effect service of the Amended Writ within jurisdiction on the two Defendants. The Disputed Services were therefore valid.[^2]

## Issue for Determination

11     At the risk of falling into a framing bias, the parties’ arguments raised one single issue for determination in this application – i.e. whether the 6-month validity period of the Amended Writ runs from the date the Original Writ was issued, the date of amendment, or some other date.

12     For the reasons below, my view is that the 6-month validity period of the Amended Writ began from the date on which the Original Writ was _amended_ (i.e. on 6 November 2020), and therefore the Disputed Services were validly effected.

## My Decision

### When does the validity period of a writ commence?

13     The starting point of the analysis is O 6 r 4(1) of the ROC, which provides that, for the purposes of service, a writ is valid for 6 months _beginning with the date of its issue_:

> 4.—(1)     **Subject to the other provisions of these Rules**, for the purposes of service, a writ is valid in the first instance —

>> (a)    where leave to serve the writ out of the jurisdiction is required under Order 11, for 12 months; and

>> (b)    in any other case, for 6 months,

>      **beginning with the date of its issue.**

>     (emphasis added in bold)

14     O 6 r 4(1) makes it clear that the validity period for a writ begins “_with the date of its issue_” and is “_subject to other provisions_” of the ROC. What then, is the “_date of…issue_” of the Amended Writ as it regards the 1st and 2nd Defendants? This in turn depended on how the 1st and 2nd Defendants were “_added_” as parties in this case.

### How were the Defendants joined?

15     The usual route for joinder of parties is O 15 r 6 of the ROC which empowers the court to make an order for the addition of parties at any stage of the proceedings, subject to certain conditions. In this case, however, both counsel appeared to have harboured under the impression that the Amendment Order was made pursuant to O 15 r 6A instead.[^3] This is therefore something I need to examine, as the validity period of the writ for the purposes of service may be different, depending on how the Defendants were joined.

16     Before examining the different mechanisms, the relevant rules under O 15 of the ROC are set out for ease of reference.

>      **Misjoinder and nonjoinder of parties (O. 15, r. 6)**

>     …

> (2)    Subject to the provisions of this Rule, at any stage of the proceedings in any cause or matter, the Court may, on such terms as it thinks just and either of its own motion or on application —

>> (_a_)    order any person who has been improperly or unnecessarily made a party or who has for any reason ceased to be a proper or necessary party, to cease to be a party; or

>> (_b_)    order any of the following persons to be added as a party, namely:

>>> (i)    any person who ought to have been joined as a party or whose presence before the Court is necessary to ensure that all matters in the cause or matter may be effectually and completely determined and adjudicated upon;

>>> (ii)   any person between whom and any party to the cause or matter there may exist a question or issue arising out of or relating to or connected with any relief or remedy claimed in the cause or matter which in the opinion of the Court it would be just and convenient to determine as between him and that party as well as between the parties to the cause or matter.

>     …

>      **Proceedings against estates (O. 15, r. 6A)**

> 6A.—(1)    Where any person against whom an action would have lain has died but the cause of action survives, the action may, if no grant of probate or administration has been made, be brought against the estate of the deceased.

> (2)    Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph (1), an action brought against “the personal representatives of A.B. deceased” shall be treated, for the purposes of that paragraph, as having been brought against his estate.

> (3)    An action purporting to have been commenced against a person shall be treated, if he was dead at its commencement, as having been commenced against his estate in accordance with paragraph (1), whether or not a grant of probate or administration was made before its commencement.

> (4)    In any such action as is referred to in paragraph (1) or (3) —

>> (a)    the plaintiff shall, during the period of validity for service of the writ or originating summons, apply to the Court for an order appointing a person to represent the deceased’s estate for the purpose of the proceedings or, if a grant of probate or administration has been made for an order that the personal representative of the deceased be made a party to the proceedings, and in either case for an order that the proceedings be carried on against the person appointed or, as the case may be, against the personal representative, as if he had been substituted for the estate; and

>> (b)    the Court may, at any stage of the proceedings and on such terms as it thinks just and either of its own motion or on application, make any such order as is mentioned in sub-paragraph (a) and allow such amendments (if any) to be made and make such other order as the Court thinks necessary in order to ensure that all matters in dispute in the proceedings may be effectually and completely determined and adjudicated upon.

>     …

> (7)     Where an order is made under paragraph (4), Rules 7(4) and 8(3) and (4) shall apply as if the order had been made under Rule 7 on the application of the plaintiff.

>     …

>      **Change of parties by reason of death, etc. (O. 15, r. 7)**

>     …

> (4)    The person on whose application an order is made under this Rule must, unless the Court otherwise directs, serve the order on every other person who is a party to the cause or matter or who becomes or ceases to be a party by virtue of the order and serve with the order on any person who becomes a defendant a copy of the writ or originating summons by which the cause or matter was begun.

>     …

>      **Provisions consequential on making of order under Rule 6 or 7 (O. 15, r. 8)**

> 8.—(1)    Where an order is made under Rule 6 —

>> (_a_)     the writ by which the action in question was begun must be amended accordingly and must be endorsed with —

>>> (i)    a reference to the order in pursuance of which the amendment is made; and

>>> (ii)   the date on which the amendment is made;

>> (_b_)    the amendment must be made within such period as may be specified in the order or, if no period is so specified, within 14 days after the making of the order; and

>> (_c_)     if the order is for any person to be added as a defendant, the date on which the amendment is made shall be deemed to be the date on which the action was commenced against that person.

> (2)    Where by an order under Rule 6 a person is to be made a defendant, the Rules as to service of a writ of summons shall apply accordingly to service of the amended writ on him.

> (3)    Where by an order under Rule 6 or 7 a person is to be made a defendant, the Rules as to entry of appearance shall apply accordingly to entry of appearance by him, subject, in the case of a person to be made a defendant by an order under Rule 7, to the modification that the time limited for appearing shall begin with the date on which the order is served on him under Rule 7(4) or, if the order is not required to be served on him, with the date on which the order is sealed with the seal of the Supreme Court or the seal of the State Courts, as the case may be. The entry of appearance must be in Form 10.

> (4)     Where by an order under Rule 6 or 7 a person is to be added as a party or is to be made a party in substitution for some other party, that person shall not become a party until —

>> (_a_)    where the order is made under Rule 6, the writ has been amended in relation to him under this Rule and (if he is a defendant) has been served on him; or

>> (_b_)    where the order is made under Rule 7, the order has been served on him under Rule 7(4) or, if the order is not required to be served on him, the order has been sealed with the seal of the Supreme Court or the seal of the State Courts, as the case may be,

>     and where by virtue of the foregoing provision a person becomes a party in substitution for some other party, all things done in the course of the proceedings before the making of the order shall have effect in relation to the new party as they had in relation to the old, except that entry of appearance by the old party shall not dispense with entry of appearance by the new party in Form 10.

(emphasis added in underline)

17     O 15 r 6A provides a mechanism for overcoming the difficulties of bringing proceedings where the person against whom the action would be brought has passed away without a grant of probate or administration. O 15 r 6A does so by permitting the proceedings to be commenced against the estate of the deceased without requiring the personal representatives of the estate to be identified at the time of commencement, and where the proceedings have already been commenced naming the deceased as defendant, by deeming that the proceedings had been commenced against the estate of the deceased, even though no grant of probate or administration has been made: see _Singapore Civil Procedure (2020)_, Vol 1, Sweet & Maxwell, at \[15/6A/1\]. The foregoing is of course on the basis that the cause of action survived the passing of the defendant.

18     O 15 r 6A can have important implications for the claimant, because if a claimant is unable to commence proceedings against the estate before a grant of probate or administration has been made, or if proceedings so commenced is treated as a nullity from the outset, then the claimant may face an issue with the running period of limitation. In these situations, O 15 r 6A allows a claimant to commence legal proceedings against the estate of the deceased, even though the claimant may not be aware who can represent the estate because no grant of probate or administration has been made. The claimant can commence the action against “_the personal representatives of A.B. deceased_” and this will be treated as having been brought against the estate: see O 15 r 6A(2). Similarly, if the claimant had commenced an action against a named defendant and it turned out that the named defendant had passed away at the commencement of the action, O 15 r 6A(3) allows an action so commenced to be treated as having been commenced against the estate of the deceased. No order is necessary for this purpose, as the rule itself is adequate authority: see _Singapore Civil Procedure (2020)_, Vol 1, Sweet & Maxwell, at \[15/6A/4\].

19     Although O 15 r 6A allows an action to be _commenced_ against the estate, the claimant cannot _proceed_ with an action so commenced without applying for what is commonly referred to as an “_order to carry on_” pursuant to O 15 r 6A(4) (“**Rule 6A Substitution Order**”). Such an order is necessary before the claimant can _continue_ the proceedings against the estate: see _Tan Chwee Chye and others v P V R M Kulandayan Chettiar_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 1 SLR(R) 229</span> at \[16\] and \[17\]. If there is no grant of probate or administration, the Rule 6A Substitution Order must appoint a person to represent the deceased’s estate for the purposes of the proceedings. If a grant of probate or administration has been made, then the order should state that the personal representative of the estate of the deceased be made a party to the proceedings. In either case, the claimant is required to seek an order that the proceedings be carried on against the person appointed or against the personal representative, as if he/she had been substituted for the estate: see O 15 r 6A(4)(a).

20     After a Rule 6A Substitution Order on has been obtained, the _order_ must be served on every other person who is a party to the cause or matter or who becomes or ceases to be a party by virtue of the Rule 6A Substitution Order: see O 15 r 7(4) read with r 6A(7). Further, a copy of the writ or originating summons _by which the cause or matter was begun_ must be served on any person who becomes a defendant: see O 15 r 7(4) read with r 6A(7). Collectively, these are referred to as the “**Rule 6A Service Requirements**”.

21     On the other hand, if an order was made for joinder of parties pursuant to O 15 r 6 (the “**Rule 6 Amendment Order**”), a different set of procedure follows. First, the writ by which the action in question was begun must be _amended_ and endorsed with a reference to the order in pursuance of which the amendment is made, and the date on which the amendment is made: see O 15 r 8(1)(a). Such amendment must be made within 14 days after the making of the order, unless otherwise specified by the court: see O 15 r 8(1)(b). After the writ has been amended, and if it has the effect of joining a person as a defendant, then _amended writ_ must be served in accordance with the normal rules for service of a writ of summons: see O 15 r 8(2). I will refer to these as the “**Rule 6 Service Requirements**”.

22     For a defendant who has been made a party pursuant to a Rule 6A Substitution Order, that person shall not become a party until the Rule 6A Substitution Order has been served on him in accordance with the Rule 6A Service Requirements or, if the order is not required to be served on him, the order has been sealed with the seal of the Supreme Court or the seal of the State Courts, as the case may be.

23     For a defendant who has been joined pursuant to a Rule 6 Amendment Order, the date on which the Rule 6 Amendment Order is made shall be deemed to be the date on which the action was commenced against that defendant: see O 15 r 8(1)(c). Further, the newly added defendant shall not become a party until the writ has been amended and served on him in accordance with the Rule 6 Service Requirements: see O 15 r 8(4)(a).

24     It is clear from a perusal of the relevant provisions that the procedures envisaged under O 15 r 6 and O 15 r 6A are different, with differing consequences:

> (a)      **Amendment**: In every case in which there is a change of parties pursuant to a Rule 6 Amendment Order, the original writ (or originating summons, as the case may be) _must be amended_. If the amendment was not made with the prescribed time, then the order granting leave to amend ceases to have effect, unless further extended: see O 20 r 9. Conversely, where a defendant has been substituted pursuant to a Rule 6A Substitution Order, amendment of the writ is strictly speaking not necessary. All that is required is that the title of all future proceedings should be altered in accordance with the order to carry on: see _Singapore Civil Procedure (2020)_, Vol 1, Sweet & Maxwell, at \[15/8/4\].

> (b)      **Service**: For a defendant added pursuant to a Rule 6 Amendment Order, the _amended writ_ (or originating summons, as the case may be) must be served on the defendant. Conversely, for a Rule 6A Substitution Order, there is no need to serve an amended writ since there is no need to amend the writ in the first place. Instead, O 15 r 7(4) requires the service of the Rule 6A Substitution Order and the _original writ_ on the newly substituted defendant.

> (c)      **Commencement of Proceeding**: When a person is added pursuant to a Rule 6 Amendment Order, the action is deemed to have commenced against him the date on which the Rule 6 Amendment Order was made. There is no equivalent provision for “_deemed commencement_” in respect of a Rule 6A Substitution Order. This is because a Rule 6A Substitution Order is merely an order allowing the plaintiff to _carry on_ the proceeding against the appointed representative(s) of the estate of the deceased. The action is validly commenced from the outset and is treated as having been commenced against his estate pursuant to O 15 r 6A(3) of the ROC.

> (d)      **Becoming a Party**: A defendant added or substituted pursuant to a Rule 6 Amendment Order does not become a party to the action until the _amended writ_ is served on him. The amendment of the original writ adding or substituting a person as a party is the equivalent of the issue of a new writ against that person: see _Singapore Civil Procedure (2020)_, Vol 1, Sweet & Maxwell, at \[15/8/8\]. As for a party made a defendant pursuant to a Rule 6A Substitution Order, he/she becomes a party after the Rule 6A Substitution Order has been served on him in accordance with the Rule 6A Service Requirements (or, after the Rule 6A Substitution Order has been sealed, if the order is not required to be served).

25     In this case, the Amendment Order stipulated that the 1st and 2nd Defendants be “_substituted as Defendants for the purposes of the proceedings herein with leave to amend the Writ of Summons and Statement of Claim accordingly_”, with further leave was granted for the Plaintiff to “_file the amended Writ and Statement of Claim by 10 November 2020_”. The Amendment Order also provided that the proceedings “_be carried on against_” the 1st and 2nd Defendants as administrators of the deceased Original Defendant.

26     As mentioned, after the Amendment Order was granted, the Plaintiff filed the Amended Writ in court on 6 November 2020 and served the _Amended Writ_ on the 1st and 2nd Defendants. The service of the _Amended Writ_ was the subject of the present dispute.

27     It is clear from the procedural framework under O 15, the terms of the Amendment Order and the steps actually taken by the Plaintiff, that the 1st and 2nd Defendant were in reality joined as parties to this action pursuant to O 15 r 6 and not O 15 r 6A. This is because O 15 r 6A does not require the amendment of the original writ, or the service of an amended writ. In fact, the very purpose of O 15 r 6A was to create a regime for what is in effect a substitution of parties in a very specific situation, without the claimant having to amend the writ and potentially run into issues with limitation.

28     Of course, there may well be reasons why a claimant who makes an application under O 15 r 6A may _also_ want to amend the writ, even if there is no strict need to do so. There is nothing wrong with that if the claimant would not run into limitation issues. In my view, in such a situation, the order granting leave for amendment is in reality exercised pursuant to the court’s powers under O 15 r 6 of the ROC, and all the usual requirements and consequences of an Order 6 Amendment Order must follow, including the Order 6 Service Requirements. This was what happened in this case with regard to the Amendment Order.

29     Having concluded that the Defendants were added pursuant to a Rule 6 Amendment Order, the next question is: When does the period of validity for service of an amended writ commence?

### What is the commencement date for the validity period of an amended writ?

30     As mentioned, under O 6 r 4(1) of the ROC, a writ is valid for the purposes of service for 6 months _beginning with the date of its issue_. The focus of the analysis must therefore be: what is the “_date of…issue_” of a writ which had been amended pursuant to O 15 r 6 to include additional defendants? In my view, the “_date of issue_” of such an amended writ must be the _date on which the amendment is deemed to have been made under the ROC_, and not the date of issue of the original writ. There are a few reasons for this.

31     First, as a matter of principle, where an order is made under O 15 r 6 for any person to be added as a defendant, the action is deemed to have commenced against that newly-added defendant _on the date on which the amendment is made_, and not on the date of the original writ: see O 15 r 8(1)(c). The amendment in such a situation does _not_ date back retrospectively to the time the writ of summons was first filed: see _Antariksa Logistics Pte Ltd and others v McTrans Cargo (S) Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 4 SLR 250</span> at \[100\]. Given the clear position under the ROC, the better construction of O 6 r 4(1) which produces a more consistent result with O 15 r 8(1)(c) is that where an order is made under O 15 r 6 for any person to be added as a defendant, the date of issue of the amended writ is the date on which the amendment was made.

32     Second, this reading is also consistent with the scheme envisaged under O 6 r 4. Under O 6 rrs 4(2) and 4(2A), where a writ has not been served on a defendant, the court may extend the validity of the writ, but _only_ up to a maximum period of 12 months at any one time. The court has _no jurisdiction_ to allow two or more _successive_ renewals at one time to bring the writ up to date: see _Singh (Joginder) v Duport Harper Foundries Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1994\] 1 WLR 769</span> at 772. Further, although the court may entertain an application to extend the validity of the writ _after_ the original validity period had expired, it should still be made within the appropriate period of the first expiry: see _Singh (Joginder) v Duport Harper Foundries Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1994\] 1 WLR 769</span> at 775.

33     On the other hand, an application for joinder of defendants may be made “_at any stage of the proceedings_” under O 15 r 6(2). Subject to any issue of limitation, therefore, it is entirely possible for a defendant to be properly joined under O 15 r 6(2) _years_ after the date of issue of the original writ.

34     Imagine a situation where a claimant properly obtains leave to amend his writ to join an additional party as a defendant three years after his writ was first issued. In that situation, if the “_date of issue_” of the amended writ is to be taken as the date on which the original writ was issued, this would mean that despite having shown that the additional defendant can and should be joined to the proceedings under O 15 r 6, the claimant may not be able to do so if he cannot obtain the renewals necessary to bring the writ up to the date of the amendment. In my view, such a result would be absurd, impractical and could not have been intended by the drafters of the rules.

35     Third, case authorities also support view that the “_date of issue_” of an amended writ is the date on which the amendment was made.

36     In _Folin & Brothers Sdn Bhd v Wong Foh Ling & Wong Swee Lin & Ors_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 2 MLJ 23</span> (“**_Folin & Brothers_**”), the claimant amended his writ close to nine years after it was first issued, in order to add a twelfth defendant. After the twelfth defendant was served, he applied to set aside service of the amended writ on the ground that the writ had lapsed. The learned judge in _Folin & Brothers_ examined O 15 r 8(4)(a) of the Malaysian Rules of the High Court 1980 (which is equivalent to our O 15 r 8(4)(a) of the ROC) as well as the decision of the House of Lords in the seminal case of _Ketteman and others v Hansel Properties Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1987\] AC 189</span> (“**_Ketteman_**”), which held that where a person was added as a defendant to an action, the joinder did not relate back to the issue of the writ against the original defendant but rather the action was brought against the added defendant on the date when that defendant was joined as a party to the action. The learned judge further observed that the House of Lords in _Ketteman_ had “_tacitly approved_” Lord Denning MR’s view in _Seabridge v H Cox & Sons (Plant Hire) Ltd & Anor, Barclay v Same_ \[1968\] 1 All ER 570 (“**_Seabridge_**”) that when an amendment is made adding a defendant, the amendment takes effect when it is stamped and is “_equivalent to the issue of the writ_” against that defendant: see _Folin & Brothers_ at page 40; _Seabridge_ at page 572. Considering these authorities as well as the practical consequences, the learned judge in _Folin & Brothers_ came to the conclusion that in respect of a party who was not an original party to the suit when it was first filed, but was included by way of a joinder later, it was _not_ incumbent on the part of the plaintiff to extend the validity period of the original writ summons and the statement of claim for the purpose of service on the newly added defendant. The action was deemed to have begun as against that defendant on the date of the amendment of the writ and having the appropriate life span for the purpose of service from that date: see _Folin & Brothers_ at page 44.

37     There was, however, a contrary authority which had been brought to my attention by the Defendants’ counsel in the course of oral arguments. This was the case of **_Sim Piek Hoon v Khong Kum Tuck (deceased) (represented by Wo Chun Hong)_** <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 245</span> (“**_Sim Piek Hoon_**”).

38     In _Sim Piek Hoon_, the plaintiff was injured in a traffic accident and commenced proceedings against the defendant. The writ was served by way of substituted service and default judgment was entered. Subsequently, plaintiff learnt that the defendant had died before the writ was even issued. The plaintiff then applied under O 15 r 6A(4) for one Mr. Wo (the deceased defendant’s grandson) to represent the estate. By then, however, the validity of the writ for service had expired. The application under O 15 r 6A(4) was granted by a Deputy Registrar, whose decision was upheld both by a District Judge and a High Court Judge on appeal. After the appeals were disposed of, the plaintiff applied to extend the time to comply with the Rule 6A Service Requirements. This was granted.

39     What happened later was curious – the plaintiff proceeded to amend the writ by inserting the words “(Amendment No. 1 Pursuant to Order of Court dated 1 November 2016)” below the heading “Writ of Summons”. I say this is curious because first, the order made on 1 November 2016 pursuant to O 15 r 6A(4) did _not_ include an order for leave to amend the writ. Second, as explained, a Rule 6A Substitution Order does _not_ require the writ to be amended. Rather, it is the _original writ_ which should have been served on the newly substituted defendant. Be that as it may, the amended writ was filed and served on Mr. Wo. Mr. Wo then applied to set aside the service of the amended writ on the basis that the validity period for service had expired when service was effected. The learned District Judge in _Sim Piek Hoon_ agreed with Mr. Wo. The analysis of the learned District Judge was focused on whether the order granting extension of time for service of documents under O 15 r 7(4) had the effect of extending the validity period of the writ – a question which he answered in the negative. The reasoning of the learned District Judge was as follows:

> 32    The fifth question to be determined is whether the service of the writ (as amended and re-filed by the Plaintiff on 27 April 2017) on Mr Wo on 28 April 2017 pursuant to Order 15, Rule 7(4) read with Order 15, Rule 6A(7) was valid.

> 33    Order 15, Rule 7(4) … does not appear to stipulate a time within which the service of the order and writ must be carried out…

> 34     **_Given that the Plaintiff’s writ had expired on 16 October 2015 and was never renewed, the question is whether DR Chua’s order - DC/ORC 1385/2017 could, apart from granting an extension of time for service, be regarded as having the effect of extending the validity period for service of the writ for a period of 6 months from 1 May 2017 (i.e. up to 31 October 2017). To my mind, the order could not have such an effect_**….

>     …

> 35    In the premises, the purported service of the amended writ on Mr Wo’s solicitors on 28 April 2017 was a nullity because the amended writ was but still an expired writ….

40     In my view, the facts in _Sim Piek Hoon_ are not analogous to the case at hand. It is clear that in _Sim Piek Hoon_, Mr. Wo was _not_ joined as a defendant pursuant to O 15 r 6. Rather, he was _substituted_ as a defendant pursuant to an order to carry on made under O 15 r 6A of the ROC. There was no order granted for the claimant in _Sim Piek Hoon_ to amend his writ or to join additional defendants. The fact that the claimant in _Sim Piek Hoon_ did amend his writ was, in my view, a complication which arose from a procedural irregularity, but could not have changed the substantive nature of the application. The facts in _Sim Piek Hoon_ are therefore distinguishable from the present, which involved an order for joinder made pursuant to O 15 r 6.

41     In any event and should it be necessary to do so, I respectfully disagree with the analysis in _Sim Piek Hoon_ insofar as the Defendants sought to apply it to a writ _amended_ pursuant to O 15 r 6. The issue in _Sim Piek Hoon_ was whether the service of the amended writ was valid, and the learned District Judge focused his analysis on whether the validity of the _original_ writ had been extended. The implication and underlying assumption was that if there had been an order for extension, then the amended writ was validly served, and _vice versa_. In my view, this obscured a perhaps more fundamental question as to whether a renewal of the writ was _necessary_ in the first place, which did not appear to have been argued or considered in _Sim Piek Hoon_.

42     Accordingly, I am of the view that the finding and reasoning in _Sim Piek Hoon_ are not applicable to the present application, and I respectfully adopt the reasoning in _Folin & Brothers_ instead.

43     In summary, for the reasons above, I find that where a writ had been amended pursuant to O 15 r 6 of the ROC by adding a new defendant, such _amended_ writ is deemed as having been issued on the date of the amendment for the purposes of O 6 r 4(1) of the ROC. Accordingly, as against the newly joined defendant, the validity period of the _amended_ writ (be it 6 or 12 months) begins from the date of such amendment, and not the date of issue of the original writ.

44     To be clear, it is my provisional view that the “_date of amendment_” in this context refers to the date on which the writ was in fact amended in accordance with O 15 r 8(1)(a) of the ROC, and not the date on which the _amendment order_ was made. This is because under O 15 r 8(1)(b) and O 20 r 9, even after _leave_ to amend the writ has been granted, the claimant would still need to take steps to amend the writ within the prescribed period otherwise the order granting leave will lapse. Therefore, it is only when the claimant has _in fact_ made the amendment in accordance with O 15 r 8(1)(b) that the writ can be said to have been duly amended. That said, this issue was not explored in detail before me and its answer would have made no material difference to the outcome of this application. I therefore reluctantly leave this interesting issue to be considered more thoroughly on a different occasion.

### Were the Disputed Services effected during the validity period of the Amended Writ?

45     Having determined the law, the application to the facts in this case is relatively straight-forward.

46     In this case, the Original Writ and Statement of Claim were amended pursuant to the Amended Order which was granted on 27 October 2020. The Plaintiff then filed the Amended Writ on 6 November 2020. The 1st and 2nd Defendants were served with the Amended Writ within jurisdiction on 26 February 2021 and 19 November 2020 respectively. The Disputed Services were therefore effected within the 6-month validity period of the Amended Writ. This application to set aside the Disputed Services must accordingly be dismissed.

47     For completeness, insofar as the present application concerned the 2nd Defendant, there is a further reason to dismiss the application. The 2nd Defendant was served with the Amended Writ on 19 November 2020, and entered an entered appearance on 24 November 2020. Pursuant to O 12 r 7(1) of the ROC, a defendant who wishes to dispute jurisdiction shall apply for an order setting aside the writ or service of the writ within the time limited for serving a defence. In this case, there was no agreement to extend the time for the 2nd Defendant’s defence. Accordingly, the time limited for the 2nd Defendant to apply to set aside the Disputed Service would have expired on 11 December 2020. Sum 1022 was filed in March 2021 and was therefore out of time insofar as the 2nd Defendant was concerned. This would have been a further reason to dismiss the 2nd Defendant’s application in Sum 1022.

## Conclusion

48     In conclusion, Sum 1022 is dismissed.

49     As for costs, the Plaintiff submitted that costs should follow the event, but was content not to make any submission on quantum. I agreed that costs should follow the event. As for quantum, considering that the application was fixed and heard on the normal list and that it was not, in my view, wholly unmeritorious for the application to have been made, I ordered that costs be fixed at $300 (inclusive of disbursements) to be paid by the Defendants to the Plaintiff.

50     Finally, I record my appreciation to both counsel for their detailed submissions.
