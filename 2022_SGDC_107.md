### Deputy Presiding Judge Jennifer Marie:

## Introduction

1       The accused pleaded guilty to one charge under s 417 read with s 116 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008) (the “**Penal Code**”) for abetting by engaging in a conspiracy with one Quek Puay Yi, Patricia (“**Patricia**”) to cheat Manulife (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“**Manulife**”) into delivering payment of $1,128.57. The offence was not committed in consequence of the abetment. Patricia was dealt with separately.

2       Having considered the facts and submissions by parties, I sentenced the accused to one week’s imprisonment. The accused has appealed against her sentence.

## Prescribed Penalties

3       The punishment for cheating under s 417 of the Penal Code is imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 years, or fine, or both.

4       Section 116(1) of the Penal Code provides:

> Whoever abets an offence punishable with imprisonment shall, if that offence is not committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code or any other written law for the punishment of such abetment, be punished in the same manner as if the abettor had committed the offence.

## Facts

5       The facts in support of the charge are set out in the statement of facts (“**SOF**”) which were admitted without qualification by the accused. The SOF is reproduced substantially hereinafter.

> 1.    The accused is Huang Hsin Tian Silver, a 27-year-old female Singaporean. At the material time of the offence, the accused was a financial services manager with PIAS Pte Ltd, which is a broker firm that deals in insurance. The accused’s job scope included selling insurance policies from different companies to third parties.

> 2.    The co-accused is Quek Puay Yi, Patricia, a 39-year-old female Singaporean (“Patricia”). Patricia was an insurance agent with AIA Singapore Pte Ltd (“AIA”).

> First Information Report

> 3.    On 26 October 2020, a Compliance Officer of Manulife (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“Manulife”) filed a police report, stating that Patricia had submitted a fraudulent insurance claim to Manulife. In particular, she had submitted an Accident and Health Claim form claiming insurance in respect of certain injuries on her right foot but falsified the date on which the accident had occurred.

> Facts pertaining to the charge (DAC-911298-2021)

> 4.    On Thursday, 2 July 2020, the accused received a WhatsApp message from Patricia, stating that she wished to get an “_accident\[al\] plan w mc cover_” from the accused. Patricia added that she had broken her leg “_on mon_”. The accused understood this to mean that Patricia had injured her leg on 29 June 2020, Monday, three days prior to her receipt of Patricia’s WhatsApp message. The facts of Patricia’s leg injuries were that on 29 June 2020, at Hotel G, Singapore, she had tripped over a barricade rope and fallen over, hurting her right foot (“the Accident”).

> 5.    The accused then told Patricia that she dealt with insurance policies under Manulife, and Patricia expressed her interest in them. One day later, on 3 July 2020, Patricia signed the necessary documents for a Manulife insurance policy and the accused promptly submitted the same to Manulife (hereinafter referred to as “the Manulife Policy”).

> 6.    On 7 July 2020, Patricia told the accused that she was “_due for surgery next wk_”. Prior to this juncture, Patricia had already formed the intention to submit an insurance claim under the Manulife Policy for her injuries in respect of the Accident, despite knowing that the said injuries pre-dated her application for the Manulife Policy.

> 7.    Extracts of the parties’ conversation on 7 July 2020 are reproduced below. In particular, both the accused and Patricia knew that the latter’s injuries had pre-dated her application for the Manulife Policy. The accused then replied that she could “_just try_” to claim under the Manulife Policy and “_\[s\]ee what happen_”:

> 8.    The Manulife Policy, bearing policy number XXX, subsequently incepted and became effective only on 15 July 2020.

> 9.    On 20 July 2020, Patricia underwent surgery in respect of the injuries on her right foot and remained hospitalised until 24 July 2020.

> 10.    On 25 July 2020, Patricia informed the accused via WhatsApp that she was discharged. Patricia knew that she had to indicate a date of the Accident after the date on which the Manulife Policy had incepted in order for her insurance claim to be considered. She thus told the accused to indicate a false date of the Accident on the claim form, and further told the accused to choose a date after the Manulife Policy had incepted:

> 11.    Therefore, on 25 July 2020, the accused abetted by engaging with Patricia in a conspiracy to do a certain thing, namely, to cheat Manulife by demanding payment from Manulife under the Manulife Policy which had taken effect on 15 July 2020. The demand of payment was in respect of Patricia’s injuries which had arose from the Accident. In pursuance of this conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing, the accused then filled up and submitted an Accident and Health Claim form stating that the date of the Accident was 18 July 2020, a date which the accused and Patricia knew to be false.

> 12.    The accused had intended by such manner of deception to dishonestly induce Manulife into delivering the amount of $1,128.57 to Patricia. The said amount comprises the following three claims: (a) weekly income benefit of $428.57, (b) fracture benefit of $300, and (c) hospital benefit of $400.

> Events after submission of claim form

> 13.    On 3 September 2020, Manulife sent Patricia a letter, stating that they were not able to admit her claim (“the First Letter”). The First Letter therein stated that Manulife had confirmed with United Specialist Centre that Patricia was treated for her right foot on 6 July 2020, before the policy inception date on 15 July 2020. The condition was therefore a pre-existing condition, which Manulife was unable to admit.

> 14.    The accused, however, received a soft copy of the First Letter before Patricia did, and forwarded a photograph of the same to Patricia on the same day. Part of the parties’ conversation is reproduced below:

>

Patricia:

 | 

Ya lo. Haiz nm la _(Interpretation: Yeah. Sigh, never mind.)_

 |
| 

Patricia:

 | 

Try liao haha _(Interpretation: Tried already haha)_

 |

  
  

> 15.    On 26 October 2020, Manulife sent Patricia another letter, stating that they had completed investigations on her claim (“the Second Letter”). The Second Letter stated that the Accident had occurred on an earlier date even before the Manulife Policy was incepted, and that Manulife had sufficient evidence that Patricia knowingly and dishonestly submitted a fraudulent claim, thereby breaching her duty of utmost good faith owed to Manulife. Manulife also voided Patricia’s policy and rejected the Claim in the Second Letter.

> 16.    Again, the accused had received a soft copy of the Second Letter before Patricia did, and she sent Patricia a photograph of the same. Manulife had also called the accused at an earlier point in time. Part of the parties’ conversation is reproduced below. The accused was shocked at Manulife’s level of rigour in verifying the integrity of the claim and told Patricia that she had feigned ignorance when Manulife called her. Patricia then encouraged the accused to pretend that she did not know what was going on:

> 17.    In light of the foregoing, Manulife was not deceived by the claim, and the offence to cheat Manulife was not committed in consequence of the accused’s abetment. The accused has thereby committed an offence under s 417 read with s 116 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

## Submissions by Parties

6       The Prosecution had sought a sentence of one to two weeks’ imprisonment, while the Defence submitted that a fine would be appropriate.

### Prosecution’s address on sentence

7       The Prosecution submitted that general deterrence was an important consideration in respect of general insurance fraud. In calling for a custodial sentence, the Prosecution argued that there is strong public interest in ensuring the integrity of the insurance and financial services industry. The Defence did not submit to the contrary.

8       In support of a custodial term, the Prosecution relied mainly on _Idya Nurhazlyn bte Ahmad Khir v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 1 SLR 756</span> (“**_Idya_**”) where Sundaresh Menon CJ held at \[47\]-\[48\] that “a custodial sentence will generally be appropriate as long as the offence in question causes a victim to part with property that has more than negligible value”. Menon CJ further observed that case precedents cited in _Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts_ (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2013) indicate that “custodial sentences for terms of between four and eight months’ imprisonment have been imposed for cheating offences that resulted in losses of between $1,000 and $15,000”.

9       The Prosecution also argued that there was a high degree of premeditation by the accused, who was an insurance agent herself, and that the offence entailed the misrepresentation of material facts to an insurance company, which breaches the duty of utmost good faith between insurers and policyholders. The Prosecution further stated that the accused was dishonest in feigning ignorance when she and Patricia were caught red-handed by Manulife.

10     The Prosecution had acknowledged in its further written submissions that no monetary loss was caused to Manulife and the amount that the accused and Patricia attempted to cheat Manulife of was low. It recognised that, based on a few reported and unreported cases relating to cheating offences, a fine was typically imposed on the accused where the victim suffered no loss, and an imprisonment term was usually imposed where the victim has suffered monetary loss. However, the Prosecution emphasised that the accused was placed in an institutional position of trust as an insurance agent, and the offence was perpetrated against the very institutions she sought to serve. Cheating cases occurring in the insurance industry should be viewed in the context of the consequences and effects of which often echo throughout the industry as opposed to being insulated.

### Mitigation

11     The Defence submitted that s 417 of the Penal Code did not prescribe a mandatory imprisonment term. As Menon CJ held in _Idya_ at \[46\]: “It is not in every case of cheating that loss will be occasioned and perhaps in such a case, where no loss was ever suffered, a fine might be appropriate.” The Defence further highlighted that fines have been routinely meted out for offences under s 417 of the Penal Code, even for choate offences.

12     It was argued that the amount attempted to be cheated was “extremely low” in the context of cheating offences, and the accused did not benefit from the transaction. Manulife was also not deceived by the claim. The accused also believed that Patricia was claiming for an accident that actually occurred, albeit before the inception date of the policy. It was submitted on behalf of the accused that the accused was simply trying to help a friend and she had committed the offence in an unsophisticated manner which could be described as “bumbling and incompetent”.

13     It was further submitted that a custodial sentence is not always necessary for deterrence. A fine would be appropriate where there was a low level of harm caused and low culpability. Where one-off offenders are concerned, prosecution itself would provide some form of deterrence: _Wuu David v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 83</span> at \[22\].

14     In response to the case of _Idya_ relied upon by Prosecution, the Defence pointed out that Menon CJ had indicated there that a custodial sentence was appropriate where the offence causes a victim to part with property with more than negligible value, and that a fine might be appropriate where no loss was ever suffered. The Defence further highlighted that, in the subsequent case of _Gan Chai Bee Anne v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 4 SLR 838</span> (“**_Gan Chai Bee_**”), Menon CJ stated that the indicative sentencing range observed in _Idya_ involved offenders who were intended to benefit from the victim’s loss.

15     The Defence requested full weight to be attributed to the accused’s plea of guilt, and for her lack of antecedents and good character to be fully taken into account.

16     With reference to some reported and unreported cases involving (a) a lack of personal benefit to the offender; and (b) cheating in the employment context, the Defence argued that a fine was appropriate in the present case. It was also highlighted that the accused was not an employee of Manulife and was not allowed to handle client monies. Neither did she have any involvement in claims processing or the power to influence any claims made.

17     Parties were invited to submit on the case of _Koh Yong Chiah v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 3 SLR 447</span> (“**_Koh Yong Chiah_**”). In that case, the High Court held that “the fact that harm did not actually eventuate because the lie was detected fast enough, or the offender was simply lucky should not detract from the justifiability of a custodial sentence if the potential for harm to be caused was real and significant”.

18     The Defence submitted that _Koh Yong Chiah_ dealt with an offence under s 182 of the Penal Code, which was dissimilar from s 417 of the Penal Code because s 182 was a conduct offence while s 417 was an outcome-based offence. While the Defence accepted that potential harm was possibly relevant to sentencing for a s 417 offence, it stressed that real outcomes should be the focus. It argued that confidence in the insurance industry would arguably not be as adversely affected where the relevant insurance company is not deceived. In this case, the fact that Manulife was able to detect the claim, reject it, and take the offenders to the police showed the robustness of the system, and bolstered confidence in the mechanics of the claim process.

19     The Prosecution submitted, and I agree, that _Koh Yong Chiah_ was relevant insofar as it concerned the principle that even potential harm may undermine the integrity of the insurance system in Singapore.

## Sentencing Considerations

20     This is a case where the relevant sentencing principle that is engaged is deterrence. It is important to deter like-minded individuals from abusing the insurance claims system and I accept the submission that such abuse, if left unchecked, would lead to increased costs for insurers, whether due to more stringent investigations or enlarged pay-outs, and would in turn increase the cost of insurance for everyone.

21     The outcome or intended outcome of a cheating offence would usually be the primary basis for determining the appropriate sentence: see _Idya_ where Menon CJ held at \[48\] that “the primary yardstick will often be the value of the property involved”. However, cheating can occur under a wide range of circumstances involving different types of victims and offenders. In that respect, it would be useful for the sentencing analysis to begin with an examination of the offence-specific factors, followed by the offender-specific factors.

### Offence-specific factors

#### Misrepresentation to insurance company

22     The Prosecution submitted that the offence entailed the misrepresentation of material facts to an insurance company, which breached the duty of utmost good faith between insurers and policyholders. In calling for a custodial sentence, the Prosecution also submitted that there is strong public interest in ensuring the integrity of the insurance services industry, which I agree with.

#### No loss

23     I accept that Manulife suffered no loss, but this was not through any effort of the accused and her accomplice. Rather, it was fortuitous that Manulife was vigilant, and its scrutiny of the claims thwarted this enterprise of the accused and her accomplice.

24     The Prosecution, relying on _PP v Fernando Payagala Waduge Malitha Kumar_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 334</span> (“**_Fernando_**”), submitted that the absence of any financial loss is a neutral factor rather than a mitigating factor. The Defence, relying on the same case, submitted that the absence of loss was relevant to sentencing. At \[49\], the court stated:

> In my view, the fact that no or minimal loss has occurred because the offender has been apprehended or because the items or proceeds of crime are subsequently recovered is a **relevant but not decisive factor** in assessing the appropriate sentence. **The cogency of such a consideration will have to be evaluated in its proper matrix.** \[…\] Indeed, in _PP v Ng Tai Tee Janet_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 3 SLR(R) 735</span>, Yong CJ was also of the view (at \[28\]) that **when considerations of public interests were implicated, the fact that no actual harm or loss was suffered by any party was of less relevance**.

> \[Emphasis in bold\]

25     In _Idya_, Menon CJ did not rule out the possibility of a fine being imposed where the victim parts with property of more than negligible value, or a custodial sentence imposed where there was no loss suffered. It is important to examine each case on its own facts beyond simply whether there was loss caused.

26     In my view, the present matter involves considerations of the public interest given the potential impact of insurance fraud on insurers and policyholders in general. Considering further that the absence of financial loss was largely fortuitous, I am of the view that little mitigating weight should be attached to this factor.

#### Premeditation

27     I accepted that Patricia was the one who had planned and evinced a clear intention to cheat Manulife from the outset, and the role of the accused was largely that of fulfilling and facilitating Patricia’s instructions. Nevertheless, the accused played a significant role in facilitating the deception of Manulife. Instead of being a gatekeeper, she chose to “help a friend” and later sought to rely on her misplaced friendship to mitigate her conduct before this Court.

28     I now turn to the offender-specific factors.

### Offender-specific factors

#### A clean record

29     The accused is untraced and is treated as a first-time offender for the purposes of sentencing.

#### One-off offence

30     I accepted the Defence’s contention that this was a one-off offence. However, it would at best be a neutral factor and does not necessarily mean that a custodial sentence should not be imposed.

#### Role and duties as insurance agent

31     While I accept the Defence’s point that the accused was not an employee of Manulife, she was an insurance agent who had professional standards to uphold, including a duty of integrity, a duty to act in good faith, as well as the duty of loyalty to her “principal”, in this case Manulife. Yet, the accused knowingly turned a blind eye to these duties, and instead told Patricia that she would ''_just try \[to\] claim_''.

32     The accused further exhibited dishonesty and a lack of remorse when she feigned ignorance after being caught red-handed by Manulife. The WhatsApp messages between the accused and Patricia as reproduced in para 16 of the SOF are telling – instead of showing any contriteness for her role in the deception, the accused chose to continue with the deception:

 |
| 

Silver:

 | 

(crying emoticon)

 |
| 

Patricia:

 | 

U jus say u dk _(Interpretation: You just say you don’t know)_

 |

  
  

33     The essential gravamen of the offence is dishonesty, and I did not consider that the accused’s conduct could be explained away simply on the basis that the accused was naïve or immature. The fact that she is an incompetent criminal is not a mitigating factor. In any event, I do not agree with the Defence’s submission that the accused was “extremely naïve”. Any naivety would have pertained only to the probability of checks being conducted on the fraudulent claim rather than the dishonesty and wrongfulness of her conduct.

34     The accused here was placed in an institutional position of trust as an insurance agent, and insurance companies should reasonably expect claims submitted by their own insurance agents to be genuine and accurate. Whilst this is not a case where the accused had taken advantage of her role as an agent to enhance the possibility of a successful claim, her conduct as an insurance agent betrayed the trust and confidence reposed in her. It is important that the accused and like-minded insurance agents be deterred from committing similar offences.

#### Lower culpability than co-accused

35     I note that the Prosecution accepted, and I agree, that the accused was of lower culpability than Patricia based on what was presented in the SOF.

#### No personal enrichment

36     I further accept that the accused did not instigate the commission of the offence, nor did she intend to be financially enriched herself. Two cases highlighted by counsel, namely _Seaward III Frederick Oliver v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1994\] 3 SLR(R) 89</span> (“**_Seaward_**”) and _Soh Puay Luan v PP_ (Magistrate’s Appeal No 383 of 1993, unreported), demonstrate that fines have been imposed in cheating cases where there was an absence of personal enrichment to the offender. In _Seaward_, a nominal one-day imprisonment was imposed as the charge was for an offence under s 420 of the Penal Code where imprisonment was mandatory. In that case, as well as the later case of _Nathan Edmund v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 2 SLR(R) 926</span> (“**_Nathan Edmund_**”), also a case involving s 420 of the Penal Code, Yong Pung How CJ held that a nominal one-day imprisonment was appropriate as the appellants did not intend to be personally enriched by commission of the offence.

37     It should be noted, however, that these cases predate _Idya_ and do not relate to insurance fraud committed by an insurance agent. The offenders in these cases were technically not in a position of trust vis-à-vis the financial institutions which they were complicit in defrauding. Further, the impact of their actions (inflating figures to receive a higher loan amount or misusing credit cards) were limited and different from the potential impact that fraudulent insurance claims, perpetuated by insurance agents no less, could have on insurers and the public.

38     In _Gan Chai Bee_, Menon CJ had pointed out that the indicative sentencing range of four to eight months’ imprisonment he had observed in _Idya_ pertained to cases where the offender intended to benefit from the victim’s loss, where the loss was between $1,000 and $15,000. Again, the learned Chief Justice did not rule out the possibility of a custodial term being imposed in cases where the offender did not intend to benefit from the victim’s loss. In fact, in _Gan Chai Bee_ itself, the offender was sentenced to a custodial term of one week’s imprisonment for each proceeded charge, most of which involved amounts of less than $1,000, even though she did not intend to be personally benefited. In holding that the custodial threshold had been crossed, Menon CJ stated the reasons as such:

> This is not because of the value involved in the offences, but because of the premeditation and planning with which the appellant participated in the dishonest scheme, and because of the sustained and deliberate manner in which she committed the offences which revealed a mind consciously habitualised to crime.

39     Although these factors are not directly applicable in the present matter, there were other aggravating factors which I considered. What, in my view, breached the custodial threshold in this case was the fact that the accused was an insurance agent who had colluded to defraud an insurance company which she represented, and the unashamed attitude she had shown when she tried to feign ignorance after being caught red-handed.

#### Cheating in the context of employer-employee or principal-agent relationship

40     I note further that there are cases where fines have been imposed on an employee or agent who had committed an offence under s 417 of the Penal Code against his/her employer or principal under more aggravating circumstances: see for example the unreported cases of _PP v Lin Yujiao_ (SC-905195-2016); _PP v. Phan Seng Chew_ (SC-906727-2020); and _PP v Lee Wye Meng, Richard_ (SC-911136-2018). Again, these were not cases involving insurance fraud. I further accept the Prosecution’s submissions that cheating an insurance company is different from merely cheating one’s employer or principal, in that the consequences and effects of insurance cheating would often reverberate throughout the insurance industry.

#### Guilty plea

41     The Prosecution urged the court to disregard the accused’s guilty plea as a mitigating factor as she was caught red-handed. The Defence, to the contrary, submitted that it would have been viable for the accused to deny she had the necessary _mens rea_ required, insofar as she was subjectively unaware of Patricia’s intent to defraud Manulife.

42     In my view, the evidence through the WhatsApp messages clearly showed that the accused knew of the date on which Patricia sustained her injuries, and yet she proceeded to incept the insurance policy and thereafter falsify the date on which the accident occurred. A trial would have been fruitless. However, I acknowledged that the accused’s early guilty plea saved the court’s time and resources, and to that extent some mitigatory weight could be given.

## Decision on Sentence

43     I had considered carefully the further submissions made by the Prosecution and the Defence. While I agree with the Defence that a custodial sentence was not always necessary to achieve the objective of deterrence, the appropriate sentence would ultimately turn on the facts of each case.

44     The Defence expounded on several cases in which fines and/or a nominal custodial term had been imposed in situations where the offender made no personal gain from the offending act and/or where the offender had cheated his/her employer or principal. While these cases provide some guidance in relation to the present matter which bears some similarities, the particular facts of the case must be closely scrutinised. As Yong CJ held in _Soong Hee Sin v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] SGHC 50</span> at \[12\]:

> In my view, the regime of sentencing is a matter of law which involves a hotchpotch of such varied and manifold factors that no two cases can ever be completely identical in this regard. While past cases are no doubt helpful and sometimes serve as critical guidelines for the sentencing court, that is also all that they are, ie mere guidelines only. \[…\] **At the end of the day, every case which comes before the courts must be looked at on its own facts, each particular accused in his own circumstances**, and counsel be kept constantly and keenly apprised of the fact that it is just not possible to categorise cases based simply on mere numerals and decimal points.

45     This is not a case where the accused set out with a nefarious or sophisticated plot to cheat Manulife. If those had been the facts, the accused would have received a far more severe sentence that would be commensurate with that conduct. The amount which the accused and Patricia attempted to cheat Manulife of was relatively small and might, under other circumstances, attracted merely a fine. The accused also did not intend to be personally enriched.

46     However, what is key is that the accused undeniably failed to observe the standards of integrity expected of her as an insurance agent by dishonestly submitting a false claim. There is public interest in ensuring such fraudulent behaviour against insurance companies is deterred. The accused had also tried to feign ignorance when she was caught, evidencing persistent dishonesty and a lack of early remorse. She chose a pattern of conduct that has led her today to this court.

47     Having considered the facts and circumstances under which the accused committed the offence, as well as the public interest in ensuring that insurance agents in particular do not engage in insurance fraud, I am of the view that the custodial threshold has been breached. This is not a case where the objective of deterrence can be achieved with a sufficient fine quantum. There is strong public interest in ensuring the integrity of the insurance and financial services industry.

48     I therefore imposed a short custodial term of one week’s imprisonment as this, in my view, would sufficiently deter the accused and like-minded individuals and is a sentence that is both proportionate and appropriate.
