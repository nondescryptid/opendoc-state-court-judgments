Mandatory Injunction – Whether erecting a covering structure over a private rooftop terrace increases the gross floor area of the development – Whether the covering structure has affected the appearance of any building in the development – Whether the covering structure was a “nuisance or hazard” – Whether the covering structure damaged or defaced common property – Whether there had been breaches of Section 37(1), (2), (3), (4) and 63(b) of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act (Cap. 30C) – Whether there had been a breach of Statutory By-Law 5(1) of the Second Schedule of the Building Maintenance (Strata Management) Regulations 2005

23 January 2020 - Judgement reserved

### District Judge Sheik Umar Bin Mohamed Bagushair:

1       The Plaintiff manages a condominium located at Serangoon called “The Scala” (the “**Development**”). They have commenced DC/OSS 81/2019 against the 1st and 2nd Defendants (husband and wife respectively) who are the subsidiary proprietors of one of the penthouse units in the Development (the “**Unit**”). The Plaintiff seeks a mandatory injunction against the Defendants, for the Defendants to remove a roof structure that they had erected on their originally uncovered private roof terrace. For convenience, I will refer to the Defendants’ private roof terrace as the “**Roof Terrace**”, and the roof structure they had erected as the “**Roof Structure**”.

2       The Plaintiff made four arguments. **_First_**, the erection of the Roof Structure increased the permitted gross floor area (“**GFA**”) of the Development and was therefore prohibited because no prior authority was obtained under Section 37(2) of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act (Cap. 30C) (“**BMSMA**”). **_Second_**, the Roof Structure was also prohibited under Section 37(3) of the BMASA as it detracted from the appearance of the buildings in the Development. **_Third_**, the Defendants had breached Section 63(b) of BMASA because the erection of the Roof Structure had affected the Development’s lightning protection system and had therefore caused “_a nuisance or hazard_”. **_Fourth_**, the Roof Structure had damaged or defaced the common property, in breach of Statutory By-Law 5(1) of the Second Schedule of the Building Maintenance (Strata Management) Regulations 2005 (“**Statutory By-Law**”).

3       Having considered the parties’ affidavits and submissions, including further affidavits and supplemental submissions that I requested from the parties after the hearing on 1 November 2019, I am unable to accept any of the Plaintiff’s arguments and therefore dismiss the OS. However, I order that the Defendants bear the reasonable costs of the Plaintiff engaging a Qualified Person to check the Development’s lightning protection system. If it is found that as a result of the erection of the Roof Structure the lighting protection system has to be re-certified, the Defendants are to bear the reasonable costs of the re-certification.

## Background

4       The Development consists of five apartment blocks. Four of the blocks are 18 storeys high and one block is 17 storeys high. There are a total of 468 units in the Development. The Defendants purchased the Unit sometime in 2018 and completion took place on 7 September 2018. The Unit is located at the top floor of one of the apartment blocks, and has the Roof Terrace. The Roof Terrace was uncovered but after purchasing the Unit, the Defendants decided to erect the Roof Structure.

5       The Roof Structure does not cover all of the Roof Terrace, but based on the photos and floor plans, it is fair to say that it covered 60 to 70% of the Roof Terrace area that would have otherwise been exposed to the elements. Three sides of the Roof Terrace are surrounded by fairly high concrete walls. The 4th side of the Roof Terrace, the side facing out, was originally uncovered but the Defendants had installed invisible grilles. No issue arises out of the installation of these grilles.

6       The floor plan of the Roof Terrace is reproduced in Figure 1.

7       Photos of the Defendants’ Roof Structure, taken from the Roof Terrace, are reproduced in Figures 2 to 7.

8       The parties in their respective affidavits referred to the communications between them before and during the erection of the Roof Structure. Nothing turns on these communications. In particular, the Defendants have not argued that because of the Plaintiff’s conduct, it must be taken to have agreed to the erection of the Roof Structure or is now estopped from objecting to the Roof Structure.

9       The issues which I have to decide are as follows:

> (a)     Has the erection of the Roof Structure resulted in an increase in the Development’s GFA thus requiring approval pursuant to Sections 37(1) and (2) of BMASA?

> (b)     Has the Roof Structure affected the appearance of any building in the Development, in breach of Section 37(3) of BMASA, and if so, has the Plaintiff granted approval under Section 37(4) of BMASA?

> (c)     Has the Roof Structure caused “a nuisance or hazard” to other occupiers, in breach of Section 63(b) of BMASA?

> (d)     Has the Roof Structure damaged or defaced the common property in breach of Statutory By-Law 5(1)? If so, can the breach nevertheless be excused under Statutory By-Law 5(3)(c) because it prevented harm to the Defendants’ children?

## Has the erection of the Roof Structure over the Roof Terrace resulted in an increase in the Development’s GFA?

### Parties’ arguments

10     The Plaintiff argued that the erection of the Roof Structure resulted in an increase in the Development’s GFA. This is because the URA treats the GFA of indoor areas differently from outdoor or semi-outdoor areas such as the Roof Terrace. Relying on the decision of _Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 3667 v Chong Tack Chuan & anor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 30</span> (“_Chong Tack Chuan_”), the Plaintiff argued that by roofing up and enclosing the Roof Terrace, the Development’s GFA increased.

11     The Defendants argued that an Urban Redevelopment Authority (“**URA**”) circular dated 28 February 2014 (the “**URA Circular**”) had the effect of changing how the URA treated the GFA of private enclosed spaces (“**PES**”) and private roof terraces (“**PRT**”). Roofing up or enclosing a PES or PRT would therefore not result in any change to the Development’s GFA.

### Decision

12     I find that the erection of the Roof Structure did not result in an increase in the Development’s GFA and therefore there is no breach of Section 37(1) of BMASA.

#### URA’s treatment of GFA of PES and PRT before the URA Circular

13     It is first necessary to say something about the concept of GFA and how it is used by planning authorities to control and administer the usage of land in Singapore. In _Choo Kok Lin and anor v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 2405_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 4 SLR(R) 175</span> (“_Choo Kok Lin_”), the Honourable Judith Prakash J (as she then was) described the concept of GFA and the ancillary concept of Gross Plot Ratio (“**GPR**”) in the context of developments in Singapore as follows (at \[37\]):

> Each developer building a development in Singapore has to conform with the overall gross floor area (usually referred to as “GFA”) for that development as specified by the URA. As stated by the judge, the GFA of each development is determined by the approved Gross Plot Ratio (“GPR”) for the land on which it is constructed. The GPR is approved by the chief planner in accordance with the master plan and it determines the land premium or the development charge payable by the developer. Based on that fee, the URA will permit the developer to develop the site up to a limit and that limit is the maximum permissible GFA. Once the GFA has been ascertained, the area of the constructed development cannot exceed the GFA. If it does, additional premium will be payable to the authorities.

14     In _Chong Tack Chuan_, the learned District Judge Samuel HK Chua explained that the concepts of GFA and GPR were used by the planning authorities to regulate the bulk and intensity of developments within a particular site, amongst other things. The planning authorities could also use the same tools to meet specific planning objectives, such as encouraging the building of balconies, which is why the Balcony GFA Incentive Scheme was introduced (at \[13\] to \[15\]):

> 13    Singapore’s Master Plan is the statutory land use plan which guides Singapore’s development in the medium term, that is, for the next 10 to 15 years. It is reviewed by the authorities every five years. The Master Plan shows the permissible land use and density for developments in Singapore by setting out the permissible Gross Plot Ratio (“GPR”) for a particular plot of land. The Gross Plot Ratio of a plot of land is calculated by dividing its GFA by its land area. According to paragraph 3.1 of URA’s “Development Control for Parameters Handbook on Gross Floor Area”, all covered floor areas of a building, except otherwise exempted, and uncovered areas for commercial uses, are deemed the GFA of the building for purposes of plot ratio control and development charge.

> 14    The permissible GPR and GFA in the Master Plan are important planning tools used to regulate the bulk and intensity of developments within a particular site. The URA and other government agencies use the GPR and GFA allocated in the Master Plan to assess the cumulative intensity of developments in a locality and plan for the adequate provision of public infrastructure and services to serve the area. The GPR and GFA in the Master Plan are also used as indicators of massing of a development, which helps to establish the scale and character of an area.

> 15    The URA has, over the years, introduced various Bonus GFA Incentive Schemes which are intended to meet specific planning objectives, one of which is the Balcony GFA Incentive Scheme. The Balcony GFA Incentive Scheme was introduced in 2001 to encourage developers to incorporate balconies in the design of high-rise residential developments. The purpose of the Scheme is to promote the growth of high-rise greenery and tropical architecture. If developers are able to submit a balcony design in compliance with URA’s guidelines, the URA will permit the GFA of the prospective balcony areas of the project to be computed over and above the Master Plan GPR and Master Plan GFA, subject to a cap of 10% of the permissible GFA under the Master Plan.

15     URA has always treated PES and PRT differently from balconies. The Balcony GFA Incentive Scheme referred to in _Chong Tack Chuan_ only applied to balconies (I should also point out that since _Chong Tack Chuan_, URA has revised the scheme so that the maximum GFA of the balcony areas is now subject to a cap of 7%, rather than 10%). Whilst the GFA of balconies were allowed over and above the GFA of the development, subject to a cap, the GFA of PES and PRT, at least before 12 January 2013, was never included as part of the development’s GFA. In other words, the GFA of PES and PRT was ignored, which meant that developers could build as many PES and PRT as they wanted without affecting the maximum GFA of any particular development.

#### Change in URA’s treatment of GFA of PES and PRT after the URA Circular

16     URA’s treatment of GFA of PES and PRT changed with the issuance of the URA Circular. Given the importance of this document, I set it out in full below:

> **Revision of Gross Floor Area (GFA) Guidelines for Covering of Private Outdoor Spaces (such as Private Enclosed Spaces and Private Roof Terraces) within Non-Landed Strata-Titled Residential Developments**

> **Who should know**

> Home owners and Management Corporations (MCST)/ Managing Agents of non-landed strata-titled residential developments

> **Effective date**

> With effect from 01 March 2014

> **Background**

> 1.    Outdoor spaces are commonly designed as complementary spaces in non-landed strata-titled residential units. Such spaces, which form part of the unit’s private strata area, are usually at the first storey or roof level and examples include private enclosed spaces (PES) and private roof terraces (RT).

> 2.    Although such spaces are intended to be outdoor spaces, home owners and residents often seek to erect covering structures to provide shelter from the weather and, in the case of PES, litter from upper floors. URA has considered feedback from home owners and residents in reviewing the guidelines regulating these spaces.

> 3.    On 12 January 2013, URA implemented revised guidelines which treated PES and private RT in non-landed strata-titled residential developments as Gross Floor Area (GFA). The revised guidelines apply to developments which are submitted and approved on or after 12 January 2013. Owners of units in these developments would not be constrained by GFA controls if they wished to erect covering structures in their PES or private RT.

> **Details of Revised Measures**

> 4.    The latest revisions, which are the subject of this circular, seek to accord owners of units in existing and earlier approved developments (i.e. those on which the earlier revised guidelines introduced on 12 January 2013 do not apply) the same flexibility to erect additional covering structures in their outdoor spaces (e.g. PES and private RT).

> 5.    Under the latest revised guidelines, the covering of outdoor spaces such as PES and private RT will be exempted from computation as GFA. For covering structures over PES and private RT which extend beyond 2m of the external wall of the unit, planning permission from URA is required. URA will assess all proposals on the basis of prevailing development control guidelines to ensure that such structures are not excessively large and are in compliance with the building setback and/or height controls. The covered spaces shall retain a semi-outdoor character. GFA exemption will not apply if the covered area is enclosed at the sides.

> 6.    Applications to URA for planning permission need not be submitted by Qualified Persons, but home owners should ensure that the erected structure is safe and meets the requirements of other relevant agencies such as the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) and the Fire Safety and Shelter Department (FSSD, SCDF).

> 7.    We wish to emphasise that planning permission from URA granted under the Planning Act does not, in any way, supersede any requirements or by-laws that the MCST may have or impose on the development within its powers under the Building Maintenance & Strata Management Act. Home owners are still obliged to comply with the by-laws which are administered by the development’s MCST and should separately seek the consent of the MCST before erecting the proposed structures.

> 8.    For developments with multiple units in which owners wish to either erect new covers or regularise existing ones, the MCST is encouraged to guide owners towards a consistent design which is agreeable to residents in the development. The MCST should decide on standard design guidelines for the covering structures and pass them in the form of a by-law at the general meeting. For such cases, the MCST may wish to coordinate a joint submission to URA on behalf of the affected units.

> **Implementation**

> 9.    The revised GFA guidelines will take effect on 01 March 2014 and apply to non-landed strata-titled residential developments which had been submitted and granted Provisional Permission prior to 12 Jan 2013.

> …

17     It appeared to me that URA changed its policy in relation to PES and PRT in two ways. First, whilst previously the GFA of PES and PRT was not even included in the GFA of the development, it would now be included, at least for developments approved on or after 12 January 2013. URA’s Handbook on Gross Floor Area (as at October 2019) (“**URA GFA Handbook**”), at paragraphs 5.04 and 5.05, specifies that the GFA of PES and PRT will be allowed up to a maximum of 7% over and above the development’s permitted GFA. The second change is that covering up the PES and PRT would **_not_** affect the GFA of the development. For developments approved before 12 January 2013, where the GFA of PES and PRT had never before been included in the GFA of the development, paragraph 5 of the URA Circular provides that “the covering of outdoor spaces such as PES and private RT will be exempted from computation as GFA_._” As for developments approved on or after 12 January 2013, paragraph 4 of the URA Circular provides that “\[o\]wners of units in these developments would not be constrained by GFA controls if they wished to erect covering structures in their PES or private RT.”

18     According to the URA GFA Handbook, the PES and PRT would have to satisfy certain guidelines as set out in the URA Residential Handbook. That in turns specifies that at least for PRT, its open and semi-outdoor nature must be retained, and any structures must remain open-sided as viewed from the external façade.

19     Given the change in URA’s policy towards PES and PRT, erecting a covering structure over a PRT, such as the Roof Structure that the Defendants erected, would not result in an increase in a development’s GFA, so long as the PRT’s open and semi-outdoor nature is retained and the covering structure remains open-sided as viewed from the external façade.

#### Relevant legislation

20     I first start with the relevant provisions in BMASA, which are Sections 37(1), (2), (2A) and (5):

> 37.—(1)    Except pursuant to an authority granted under subsection (2), no subsidiary proprietor of a lot that is comprised in a strata title plan shall effect any improvement in or upon his lot for his benefit which increases or is likely to increase the floor area of the land and building comprised in the strata title plan.

> (2)    A management corporation may, at the request of a subsidiary proprietor of any lot comprised in its strata title plan and upon such terms as it considers appropriate, by 90% resolution, authorise the subsidiary proprietor to effect any improvement in or upon his lot referred to in subsection (1).

> (2A)  To avoid doubt, subsections (1) and (2) do not affect the operation of the Planning Act (Cap. 232), or any requirement under that Act for written permission for any improvement in or upon a lot which increases or is likely to increase the floor area of the land and building comprised in the strata title plan.

> …

> (5)    In this section, in relation to any land and building comprised in a strata title plan, “floor area” has the same meaning as in the Planning (Development Charges) Rules (Cap. 232, R 5).

21     “Floor area” is defined in the Planning (Development Charges) Rules as follows:

> “floor area” means —

>> (a)    the gross area of all covered floor space (whether within or outside a building and whether or not enclosed) measured between party walls including the thickness of external walls where there are such walls;

>> (b)    the gross area of floor space in an open area used as a beer garden, drive-in, eating area or for other similar commercial purposes; and

>> (c)    the gross area of floor space in any outdoor area (whether covered or otherwise) which is approved by the competent authority as private enclosed space or private roof terrace in a building (not being a landed dwelling-house) in the grant of planning permission or conservation permission in relation to —

>>> (i)    an application for planning permission or conservation permission submitted on or after 12th January 2013; or

>>> (ii)   an application for planning permission or conservation permission submitted before 12th January 2013 (“the original application”) and which is followed by a subsequent application for amendment to the plans contained in the original application, submitted on or after 12th January 2013, due to an advice given by the competent authority to the original application,

> but excludes any covered area as specified by the Minister

22     The definition of “floor area” in the Planning (Development Charges) Rules appears to refer to the development’s GFA and is consistent with URA’s treatment of GFA although the definition lacks the detailed treatment of GFA found in the URA GFA Handbook. Paragraph 3.1 of the URA GFA Handbook states that “\[a\]ll covered floor areas of a building, except otherwise exempted, and uncovered areas for commercial uses are deemed the gross floor area of the building for purposes of plot ratio control and development charge” and further that “\[t\]he gross floor area is the total area of the covered floor space measured between the centre line of party walls, including the thickness of external walls but excluding voids.” I also observe that the definition of “floor area” very carefully only includes the GFA of PES and PRT for developments approved on or after 12 January 2013 (or if they were submitted before 12 January 2013, there was a subsequent amendment to the plans made on or after 12 January 2013). This is consistent with the URA Circular which continues to exclude the GFA of PES and PRT for developments approved before 12 January 2013 in the calculation of the development’s GFA.

23     However, these statutory provisions do not say anything about whether covering up PES or PRT would result in an increase in a development’s GFA, which is the position being argued by the Plaintiff.

#### Relevant case law

24     I asked parties to submit on any cases applying Section 37(1) of BMASA, in particular cases where Section 37(1) had been found to be applicable to a case such as the present where a covering structure is erected over a PRT. The Defendants could not point me to any relevant cases but the Plaintiff referred me to _Chong Tack Chuan_ and argued that it stood for the proposition that covering up a PRT would increase the GFA of the development. I am unable to agree that _Chong Tack Chuan_ stands for that proposition. In the first place, _Chong Tack Chuan_ dealt with balconies, which URA had always treated differently from PES and PRT. In _Chong Tack Chuan_, the Court had to decide whether the installation of certain screens in a balcony satisfied URA’s two criteria for balconies, namely that the screens had to be porous enough for natural ventilation at all times even when the screens were fully drawn closed, and that the screens were capable of being drawn open or retracted fully. The Court found that the screens did not satisfy one of the two criteria, and therefore the balcony GFA increased the GFA of the development. Contrary to the Plaintiff’s argument, _Chong Tack Chuan_ does not stand for the proposition that roofing up and enclosing a PRT would increase the GFA of the development.

25     I have also considered _Choo Kok Lin_. That case was decided in 2005, before the URA’s change in its treatment of PES and PRT. In _Choo Kok Lin_, the Court appeared to accept (without parties arguing the point seemingly) that the erection of a roof over PES areas which were originally uncovered would convert those areas into GFA which therefore had to be included in the development’s GFA (at \[38\] of _Choo Kok Lin_). I also observe that at \[49\] of _Choo Kok Lin_ the Court commented, _obiter_, that by virtue of the recent passing of the BMASA, and in particular Section 37, “the subsidiary proprietors who wish to cover their PES areas would require the authorization of the MCST supported by a resolution of 90% of the subsidiary proprietors in order to do so.” I am a bit hesitant to immediately conclude that, before 12 January 2013, _any_ covering up of PES (or PRT) areas would trigger Section 37(1) of BMASA. It would all depend on whether the GFA of the development would have increased. If URA’s position before 12 January 2013 was that the erection of any covering structure over PES or PRT areas (regardless of the size of the covering structure) would result in the GFA of the PES or PRT being included in the development’s GFA, then Section 37(1) of BMASA would be triggered and approval would be needed under Section 37(2). There is no evidence before me as to the specifics of how URA treated the erection of any covering structures over PES or PRT before 12 January 2013, in particular in what situations would it result in an increase in the development’s GFA. What is clear is that after 12 January 2013, the installation of any covering structure would **_not_** result in any change in the development’s GFA, as made clear in the URA Circular.

26     One might argue that it is somewhat unusual that the interpretation of the phrase in Section 37(1) of BMASA, “an improvement…which increases or is likely to increase the floor area” could change in light of the URA Circular. Whilst “floor area” is defined in the Planning (Development Charges) Rules, the reality is that the details and minutiae of what is or is not included in a development’s GFA is set out either in URA’s circulars or the URA GFA Handbook (which is constantly being updated). Given that what is or is not included as GFA is decided by URA, the definition of “floor area” in Section 37(1) of BMASA could therefore evolve over time, as it has in this case with respect to PES and PRT. There is nothing in theory objectionable with Parliament fixing the definition of a certain phrase or provision in a statute to something which can change or evolve over time.

#### Application to the facts

27     It is not entirely clear if the Development was approved before or after 12 January 2013. However, regardless of when the Development was approved, it is clear that the erection of the Roof Structure over the Roof Terrace does not lead to an increase in the Development’s GFA. I also consider that the Roof Structure satisfies URA’s two requirements for PRT. Based on the photos provided, the Roof Terrace’s open and semi-outdoor nature has been retained and the Roof Structure remains open-sided as viewed from the external façade. As the erection of the Roof Structure did not lead to an increase in the Development’s GFA, there is no breach of Section 37(1) of BMASA and the issue of obtaining approval under Section 37(2) of BMASA does not arise.

28     I should also address the Plaintiff’s argument that the erection of the Roof Structure breached Additional By-Laws 15.1 and 15.2, which states:

> (15.1)    Under the Planning Rule, the terrace (if any) and planter are open covered spaces. Their provision in the Development is a design intent and are in accordance with planning guidelines. Accordingly, you will not be allowed to cover them or convert them to other uses (Whether before or after the formation of the Management Corporation for the Development).

> (15.2)    Urban Redevelopment Authority (“URA”), the relevant authority will not allow their cover up as the Development has already reached the maximum allowable Gross Floor Area.

29     I have concluded that the position after the URA Circular is that the erection of structures over PES and PRT does not increase the GFA of a development. Additional By-Laws 15.1 and 15.2 prohibit the covering up of terrace and planter areas _because_ it would breach planning guidelines and would increase the GFA of the Development. Given how Additional By-Laws 15.1 and 15.2 have been phrased, I do not think it can be enforced, in so far as the enforcement is premised on a state of law which no longer exists (which is the case here). This is not to say that the Plaintiff can _never_ regulate the erection of covering structures over PES and PRT – they are simply not permitted to do so on the basis of a legal state of affairs which no longer exists. In light of the URA Circular, I am not even sure that the Plaintiff can impose a blanket prohibition on the erection of covering structures over PES and PRT, as opposed to simply regulating their design or construction. The extent to which the Plaintiff can regulate the erection of covering structures built over PES and PRT through by-laws would likely depend on whether such actions would fall within an MCST’s powers to regulate under Section 32(3) of BMASA. I say no more on this given this issue was not argued by parties.

## Has the Roof Structure affected the appearance of any building in the Development?

### Parties’ arguments

30     The Plaintiff argued that the erection of the Roof Structure affected the appearance of the block that the Unit was located in, whilst the Defendants disputed this. Both parties produced photos of the Roof Terrace, taken from different vantage points, to support their respective positions.

### Decision

31     I find that the Roof Structure has not affected the appearance of any building in the Development and therefore there is no breach of Section 37(3) of BMASA.

32     Sections 37(3) and (4) of BMASA provides as follows:

> (3)    Except pursuant to an authority granted under subsection (4) by the management corporation or permitted under section 37A, no subsidiary proprietor of a lot that is comprised in a strata title plan shall effect any other improvement in or upon his lot for his benefit which affects the appearance of any building comprised in the strata title plan.

> (4)    A management corporation may, at the request of a subsidiary proprietor of any lot comprised in its strata title plan and upon such terms as it considers appropriate, authorise the subsidiary proprietor to effect any improvement in or upon his lot referred to in subsection (3) if the management corporation is satisfied that the improvement in or upon the lot —

>> (a)    will not detract from the appearance of any of the buildings comprised in the strata title plan or will be in keeping with the rest of the buildings; and

>> (b)    will not affect the structural integrity of any of the buildings comprised in the strata title plan.

33     In _Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 940 v Lim Florence Marjorie_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 4 SLR 773</span> (“_Lim Florence Marjorie_”), the Court said the following in relation to the interpretation of Section 37(3) of BMASA (at \[74\]-\[78\]):

> 74    Determining whether renovations affect the appearance of a building is a factual exercise, undertaken by comparing the façade presented by the flat in question with the façade presented by other similar flats and by all of the flats as a whole: _MCST Plan No 1786 v Huang Hsiang Shui_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] SGDC 20</span> at \[112\]. Thus, for instance, a feature permanently affixed to a balcony and which does result in the balcony looking different from its original state does affect the overall appearance of the building: _MCST Plan No 1378 v Chen Ee Yueh Rachel_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] 3 SLR(R) 630</span> (“_Chen Ee Yueh Rachel_”) at \[17\].

> 75    Whether an improvement effected to a particular flat affects the façade of its building is not to be ascertained as a theoretical exercise but from the viewpoint of a reasonable observer who looks at the building from a position which is practically possible or likely. As Derrington J stated in _Re J Saunders_ (1993) NSW Titles Cases 80-019:

>> The concept of appearance necessarily connotes the existence of an observer who has the capacity to see the appearance. … it is predicated that such views are limited to those which can reasonably be taken. The concept does not extend to a theoretical appearance as it might be seen by a person placed in a position which is not practically possible or likely.

> 76    The parties tendered various photographs of the defendant’s balcony and the balconies of surrounding flats comprising the same façade. The sliding doors between the living room and the balcony of flats in The Arcadia are set well back from the external wall of the balcony. That means that the observer’s vantage point has a significant effect on whether the Works are visible.

> 77    The Works are not visible in the photographs adduced by the defendant, whether by reason of poor colour contrasting or obstruction by objects such as trees. But, despite the deep setback to the sliding doors, the Works are clearly visible in the photographs adduced by the plaintiff. And these photographs show a discernible variance, more than de minimis, between the façade presented by the defendant’s flat and the façade presented by all of the other flats in her block, both individually and taken as a whole.

> 78    The plaintiff’s photographs were taken from two other flats in other blocks of The Arcadia facing the defendant’s flat. I am satisfied that the plaintiff’s photographs have been taken from positions which are not unfair to the defendant. The vantage points from which these photographs have been taken are practically possible or likely for a reasonable observer to occupy when looking at the defendant’s balcony.

34     The height of the Unit, at the 18th floor of the apartment block, makes it difficult for an observer standing at the ground floor of the Development to see the Unit, much less the Roof Structure. The only way an observer on the ground floor could even glimpse the Unit is by standing quite a distance away, possibly outside the Development. Both parties have produced photos of the Unit taken from the ground level. The Defendants’ photo is taken from across the street, outside the entrance of the Development. The Roof Structure is not visible from the Defendants’ photo. As for the Plaintiff’s photo, what can be seen fairly clearly is not the Roof Structure (which is barely visible) but the outline of the invisible grill located at the Roof Terrace. I also observe that some of the Plaintiff’s photos appear to be artificially magnified, presumably so that the Roof Terrace can be made more visible. I am not sure if I can accept such photos given that it does not accurately reflect what an observer would see.

35     The parties have also produced photos of the Unit taken from a higher elevation. The photos appear to be taken quite a distance from the Development, from inside other buildings. The reason why such photos can only be taken from quite a distance is likely because the Development occupies a fairly large area, and there are not many high rise buildings nearby from which the Unit is visible. The Roof Structure is not visible in these pictures. What is visible in those pictures are the invisible grilles on the Roof Terrace.

36     The Plaintiff has not produced photos of the Unit or Roof Structure as taken from other units in the Development. I conclude from the absence of such photos that the Roof Structure is also not visible from an observer standing in any of the units in the Development.

37     It appears to me that the only way an observer can see the Roof Structure is by standing either at the rooftop of the block where the Unit is located, or standing at a higher vantage point than the rooftop. However, I do not consider these to be vantage points which are practically possible or likely for a reasonable observer to occupy. The rooftop is not open to the public or other occupiers and there is no evidence of buildings nearby which are higher than the blocks in the Development.

38     Bearing in mind the guidance in _Lim Florence Marjorie_, it appears to me that the Roof Structure would not be clearly visible to a reasonable observer viewing the Unit or Roof Terrace from a position which is practically possible or likely. Consequently, the Roof Structure cannot be said to have affected the appearance of any building in the Development, and there is no breach of Section 37(3) of BMASA. Since there is no breach of Section 37(3) of BMASA, there is no issue of having to obtain the Plaintiff’s authorization under Section 37(4) of BMASA.

## Has the Roof Structure caused “a nuisance or hazard” to other occupiers, in breach of Section 63(b) of BMASA?

### Parties’ arguments

39     The Plaintiff argued that the installation of the Roof Structure could have affected the Development’s lightning protection system (“**LPS**”). According to the Plaintiff’s expert Mr. Paul Crispin Casimir-Mrowczynski, the Roof Structure “may have compromised the integrity of the \[LPS\], which now needs to be rechecked after the \[Roof Structure\] is removed, and then be re-certified by a Qualified Person.”

40     The Defendant’s expert, Mr. Wong Kian Keong, says that whilst the LPS is “effective” and is in accordance with the relevant guidelines, he considers that the installation of terminal air rods on the Roof Structure would “enhance” the effectiveness of the LPS. It should be noted that these air rods have not yet been installed on the Roof Structure.

### Decision

41     I consider the evidence of both parties to be lacking. In respect of the Plaintiff’s evidence, its case at the highest is that the LPS _may_ have been compromised by the Roof Structure, and therefore this amounts to a hazard. I do not understand why the Plaintiff has not already engaged someone to check the LPS to see if it indeed has been compromised, and to re-certify the LPS if necessary. If the checks showed that the LPS was compromised by the Roof Structure, it would have provided cogent evidence of a hazard. As it stands, there is no actual evidence of a hazard, only the _possibility_ of one.

42     As for the Defendant’s evidence, the expert report of Mr. Wong is wanting in many respects. Many of his statements are lacking in scientific rigour and analysis. The following statements (in relation to the issue of the LPS) are just some examples:

> The neighbour’s corner (unit #17-13) wall had been struck by lightning and had been chipped off (please see photo 2). This clearly demonstrate the danger of lightning.

> …

> We can be affirmative that the LPS in place is effective as the design was based on SS555:2010. However lightning is a mother nature phenomena and we cannot predict/ dictate where and when the lightning would strike. According to scientific research, lightning is prone to strike on the highest point and sharp pointing edges of the building.

43     I therefore did not find Mr. Wong’s evidence to be useful at all. His brief report of two pages consists largely of conclusions favourable to the Defendants, without the necessary analysis expected of a professional engineer, much less an expert to the Court.

44     Although there are deficiencies in evidence on both sides, the Plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that there has been a breach of Section 63(b) of BMASA. I do not consider that it had done so and therefore I am not prepared to hold that Section 63(b) of BMASA has been breached. However, in light of the possibility of the LPS being compromised by the Roof Structure, I consider it appropriate to order that the Defendants bear the reasonable costs of the Plaintiff engaging a Qualified Person to check the Development’s LPS. If it is found that as as result of the erection of the Roof Structure the LPS has to be re-certified, the Defendants are to bear the reasonable costs of the re-certification.

## Has the Roof Structure damaged or defaced the common property in breach of Statutory By-Law 5(1)? If so, can the breach nevertheless be excused under Statutory By-Law 5(3)(c) because it prevented harm to the Defendants’ children?

### Parties’ arguments

45     The Plaintiff argued that the beams holding up the Roof Structure rested on the top of a wall, and the top of that wall was common property. Parties are in agreement that the side of the wall facing the Roof Terrace is the Defendants’ property, whilst the side of the wall facing the rooftop is common property (for ease of reference, I will refer to the wall as the “**Common Wall**”). The Plaintiff relies on Rule 41 of the Boundaries and Survey Maps (Conduct of Cadastral Survey) Rules to argue that in such a situation, the boundary is the centre of the Common Wall. By affixing the beams to the top of the Common Wall, the Defendants had breached Statutory By-Law 5(1).

46     The Defendants denied that they had breached Statutory By-Law 5(1). They argued that the top of the Common Wall was not common property – instead, the top of the Common Wall should be considered airspace that belongs to the Defendants. In any event, if there was a breach, the Defendants were excused from that breach because they had erected the Roof Structure to prevent harm to their children.

### Decision

47     The Roof Structure is affixed to the Roof Terrace on three sides. On two of the sides, the Roof Structure is secured to walls that are within the Defendants’ lot. No issue arises out of this. The third side of the Roof Structure, namely the side facing the external façade, rests on the top of the Common Wall through beams which are affixed to the top of the Common Wall. The following diagram illustrates the top view of the Common Wall, with the rooftop (which is common property) on one side and the Defendants’ Roof Terrace on the other.

![]([2020] SGDC 0015_Image/[2020] SGDC 0015_image7.png)

48     The following pictures also show how the Roof Structure is secured to the Common Wall through beams. Figures 8 to 10 are taken from inside the Roof Terrace, while Figures 11 to 12 are taken from the other side of the Common Wall, i.e., from the rooftop.

![]([2020] SGDC 0015_Image/[2020] SGDC 0015_image8.png)

![]([2020] SGDC 0015_Image/[2020] SGDC 0015_image9.png)

![]([2020] SGDC 0015_Image/[2020] SGDC 0015_image10.png)

49     As can be seen from the photos, the beams holding up the Roof Structure are affixed to the top of the Common Wall. Statutory By-Law 5(1) provides that a “subsidiary proprietor or occupier of a lot shall not mark, paint, drive nails or screws or the like into, or otherwise damage or deface, any structure that forms part of the common property except with the prior written approval of the management corporation.” Since the beams are affixed to the top of the Common Wall through what appears to be nails or screws, there is a breach of Statutory By-Law 5(1) if it can be established that the top of the Common Wall is common property.

50     Common property is defined in BMASA as follows:

> “common property”, subject to subsection (9), means —

>> (a)    in relation to any land and building comprised or to be comprised in a strata title plan, such part of the land and building —

>>> (i)    not comprised in any lot or proposed lot in that strata title plan; and

>>> (ii)   used or capable of being used or enjoyed by occupiers of 2 or more lots or proposed lots;

>> (b)    in relation to any other land and building, such part of the land and building —

>>> (i)    not comprised in any non-strata lot; and

>>> (ii)   used or capable of being used or enjoyed by occupiers of 2 or more non-strata lots within that land or building; or

>> (c)    in relation to any land and building mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b), any of the following whether or not comprised in a lot, proposed lot or non-strata lot:

>>> (i)    the pipes, wires, cables or ducts which are used, or capable of being used or enjoyed, by occupiers of 2 or more lots, proposed lots or non-strata lots (as the case may be) within that land or building, or are used or capable of being used for the servicing or enjoyment of the common property;

>>> (ii)   the cubic space enclosed by a structure enclosing pipes, wires, cables or ducts mentioned in sub-paragraph (i);

>>> (iii)   any structural element of the building;

>>> (iv)   the waterproof membrane attached to an external wall or a roof;

_Examples_

>>>> (a)    A foundation, load-bearing wall, column or beam, a shear core, strut, ground anchor, slab (not including any layer that is the underlayment or the flooring finishing), truss and common staircase.

>>>> (b)    An external wall, or a roof or façade of a building which is used or enjoyed, or capable of being used or enjoyed, by occupiers of 2 or more lots, proposed lots or non-strata lots.

>>>> (c)    A garden, sporting or recreational facility, car park or parking area for other vehicles, none of which are comprised in a lot, proposed lot or non-strata lot.

>>>> (d)    A central air-conditioning system and its appurtenances, and a fire sprinkler protection system and its appurtenances.

>>>> (e)    Any chute, pipe, wire, cable, duct or facility for the passage or provision of water, sewage, drainage, gas, oil, electricity, telephone, radio, television, garbage, heating or cooling systems, or any other similar services.

51     In _Sit Kwong Lam v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 2645_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 790</span> (“_Sit Kwong Lam_”), the Court of Appeal discussed the concept of “common property” in BMASA. I derive the following propositions from _Sit Kwong Lam_:

> (a)     The fact that an area had been demarcated as common property on the strata title plan established that it was, at least on a presumptive basis, part of the common property of the development (_Sit Kwong Lam_ at \[34\] to \[37\]);

> (b)     Limbs (i) and (ii) of sub-section (a) of the definition of “common property” in BMASA are to be read conjunctively (_Sit Kwong Lam_ at \[40\] to \[46\]);

> (c)     Limb (ii) of sub-section (a) of the definition of “common property” in BMASA is to be read broadly. Any area or installation that could affect the appearance of a building in a strata development, or that was part and parcel of the fabric of the building, could, by its mere presence, be “enjoyed” by some or even all subsidiary proprietors of the development. There was no need for the area or installation to be physically accessible by the subsidiary proprietors (or any of them) in order to be “enjoyed” by the said proprietors (_Sit Kwong Lam_ at \[57\] to \[60\]);

> (d)     Any area or installation in respect of which the MCST had assumed a duty to control, manage, administer or maintain would presumptively be taken to have satisfied the second limb, unless it was shown that the MCST ought not to have assumed such a duty (_Sit Kwong Lam_ at \[61\]).

52     The top of the Common Wall is a _sliver_ of property located in between common property and the Defendants’ lot. I first consider whether this area falls within the definition of “common property” and the explanations found in BMASA.

#### “Foundation, load-bearing wall, column or beam”

53     Whilst the Common Wall could be described as a “foundation, load-bearing wall, column or beam,” I am not sure that necessarily tells us if the top of the Common Wall can also be so described, and therefore be common property. This is because it is clear that one side of the Common Wall (i.e., the side in the Defendants’ lot) is _not_ common property. In other words, I am not sure describing the Common Wall as a “foundation, load-bearing wall, column or beam” resolves the issue of whether the top of the Common Wall is common property given that parts of the Common Wall are clearly not common property.

#### “External wall”

54     I think the description “external wall” must necessarily be limited to those walls that are located outside of a subsidiary proprietor’s lot and the fact that a wall is not indoors does not make it automatically an “external wall”. For example, the Defendant’s Roof Terrace is surrounded by three walls, all of which are within the Defendants’ lot and therefore part of their property. Even though these walls are not located indoors, they cannot possibly be considered to be “external wall\[s\]” if that would mean they become common property. If I am right that “external wall” must be limited to those walls that are located outside of a subsidiary proprietor’s lot, then I would first need to resolve as a preliminary issue whether the top of the Common Wall falls within the Defendants’ lot. In that respect, the description “external wall” does not really help me in deciding whether the top of the Common Wall is common property.

#### “Roof”

55     I do not think the area falls within the description of “roof”. Whilst it may be part of the rooftop, it does not follow that it can also be described as a “roof”. That would stretch the meaning of “roof”.

#### “Façade”

56     Lastly, I do not consider the area to be a “façade” given that it is not outward facing and cannot really be viewed unless the observer is in the Defendant’s Roof Terrace or in the rooftop (which is not accessible to the public or other occupiers).

#### Strata title plan

57     I next consider the various indicia of common property as explained in _Sit Kwong Lam_. I have viewed the strata title plan of the Unit and it is inconclusive. There is nothing in the strata title plan that clearly shows that the top of the Common Wall is common property or is part of the Defendants’ lot.

#### Whether the Plaintiff assumed a duty to control, manage, administer or maintain the area

58     The Plaintiff has not produced any evidence that it had assumed a duty to control, manage, administer or maintain the top of the Common Wall, although I think it is likely that the Plaintiff never thought of maintaining the top of the Common Wall given its area and location.

#### Whether the area could affect the appearance of a building in the development, or was part and parcel of the fabric of the building

59     The only way anyone can even see the top of the Common Wall is if they were standing in the Defendants’ Roof Terrace or in the rooftop (which is not accessible to the public or other occupiers). In my view, the very limited way that the top of the Common Wall can be seen means that it can neither affect the appearance of the building nor can it be said to be “part and parcel of the fabric” of the building.

60     The top of the Common Wall does not clearly fall within the definition of “common property.” Nor does it satisfy any of the indicia of common property. I am therefore unable to conclude that the top of the Common Wall is “used or capable of being used or enjoyed by occupiers of two or more lots,” even bearing in mind the broad meaning ascribed to this phrase in _Sit Kwong Lam_. Therefore, I do not consider the top of the Common Wall to be common property.

61     I have considered whether Rule 41 of the Boundaries and Survey Maps (Conduct of Cadastral Survey) Rules applies. That Rule provides that “\[u\]nless otherwise stipulated on the strata certified plan, the common boundary of any lot with another lot or with the common property shall be the centre of the floor, wall or ceiling, as the case may be.” The Plaintiff argued that this meant that half of the top of the Common Wall was common property, whilst the other half is part of the Defendants’ lot. Since the beams of the Roof Structure, at the points where it touches the top of the Common Wall, occupies the whole width of the top, the beams are therefore occupying both the common property and the Defendants’ lot.

62     I am unable to accept the Plaintiff’s argument. In this regard, I agree with what the learned District Judge Fong Kim Man had said in _Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 4131 v Elly and anor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 295</span> at \[32\] where she commented that Rule 41 is a rule in relation to the defining of boundaries for the purposes of conducting cadastral surveys, and is not a rule about defining what constitutes common property. What is or is not common property would depend on BMASA.

63     Arising from my holding that the top of the Common Wall is not common property, does it follow that it is therefore part of the Defendants’ lot? I am not sure that it would, and I do not think it is strictly necessary to come to a landing on that question. This is because in order to establish a breach of Statutory By-Law 5(1), what needs to be established is that the area that was damaged or defaced is common property. As that has not been established, there is no breach. There is no necessity for me to decide whether the area, not being common property, is therefore part of a subsidiary proprietor’s lot.

64     However, if it is necessary to decide that point, I would have held that the top of the Common Wall is _not_ part of the Defendants’ lot. This means that the top of the Common Wall is neither common property nor part of the Defendants’ lot. The possibility of a third category of property was alluded to at \[62\] of _Sit Kwong Lam_, where the Court of Appeal commented that situations where an area would not satisfy limbs (i) and (ii) of sub-section (a) of the definition of “common property” in BMASA (i.e., it was not comprised in a lot _and_ was also not used or capable of being used or enjoyed by occupiers of two or more lots) would be “so few and far between as to pose, in essence, a largely theoretical rather than actual problem.” I note that the Court of Appeal did not hold that this third category of property was impossible under the BMASA – just that it would be rare. It seems to me that the top of the Common Wall belongs to this rare third category of property that is neither private nor common property.

65     For completeness, I should deal with the Defendants’ argument that the top of the Common Wall should be considered airspace that belongs to them. This would be correct for areas that are part of the Defendant’s lot. However, the question that has to be answered is which part of the top of the Common Wall is common property and which forms part of the Defendants’ lot. The principle that the airspace above land belongs to the land’s owner does not provide an answer to that question. It only tells us that the airspace above the property belongs to the property owner.

66     Since the top of the Common Wall is not common property, there is no breach of Statutory By-Law 5(1). Consequently there is no need for me to decide whether the Defendants have succeeded in establishing the exception under Statutory By-Law 5(3)(c).

67     However if I am wrong in holding that Statutory By-Law 5(1) is not breached, I would have held that the Defendants have not established the exception under Statutory By-Law 5(3)(c). That exception provides that Statutory By-Law 5 “shall not prevent a subsidiary proprietor or an occupier of a lot, or a person authorised by such subsidiary proprietor or occupier from installing…any structure or device to prevent harm to children.” The Defendants argued that the Roof Structure was needed because their young children would sometimes go to the Roof Terrace unaccompanied by adults, and may climb over the Common Wall and fall.

68     I do not consider that the exception under Statutory By-Law 5(3)(c) is established because there are a number of things which the Defendants could have done which are less intrusive and would not have required infringing on the common property. This would include ensuring that there was adult supervision at all times. The Defendants have a helper so I do not think this is a burdensome requirement. Another option is to lock the door leading to the Roof Terrace so that the children would not be able to go there unaccompanied. When I asked Defendants’ counsel whether this latter option had even been explored, the answer was no, which I found surprising given that it was a much simpler way to ensure safety of the children, if that was indeed the concern. I consider that in determining whether the exception in Statutory By-Law 5(3)(c) is established, the Court should have regard to whether other options were available which could have achieved the same safety outcomes. In this case, I consider that other less intrusive options could have been explored which would have addressed the Defendants’ concern of their children being in the Rooftop Terrace without adult supervision. If these steps were somehow inadequate, the Defendants would need to explain why. In this case, the Defendants did not even explore these options, in particular locking the door that led to the Roof Terrace. Since they have not done so, and there is no reason to believe that those options would not achieve the same safety outcomes, I do not think they are entitled to rely on the exception under Statutory By-Law 5(3)(c).

## Whether a mandatory injunction should be granted

69     Where there is an encroachment by one land owner on the property of another or a subsidiary proprietor has erected structures without the permission of the management corporation, the Court does not always grant a mandatory injunction in response. The principles governing when a mandatory injunction should be granted are set out in _Choo Kok Lin_ at \[55\] to \[61\]. Given that the Plaintiff could not establish any breach, there was no need for me to consider whether a mandatory injunction should be granted in the circumstances. However, I should say that I disagree with the Plaintiff’s submission on the relevance of _Choo Kok Lim_. The Plaintiff argued that since the passing of amendments to BMASA on 1 February 2019, the principles in _Choo Kok Lim_ were no longer “useful” and is “stale law.” However, the principles on mandatory injunction in _Choo Kok Lin_ are a matter of common law, and in my view still good law. In any event, the Plaintiff did not explain how the recent amendments to BMASA rendered the principles in _Choo Kok Lin_ “stale law”.

## The Separate Roofing

70     I have at \[47\] to \[49\] above described the Roof Structure. There is a small room in one part of the Roof Terrace where a roof had also been erected. However, this roofing is separate from the Roof Structure. A picture of this is set out below at Figure 13. For convenience, I will refer to this as the “**Separate Roofing**” to distinguish it from the Roof Structure. It can be seen from the picture that the Roof Terrace is located on the left of the Separate Roofing.

![]([2020] SGDC 0015_Image/[2020] SGDC 0015_image11.png)

71     In its affidavits and written submissions, the Plaintiff did not clearly distinguish the Separate Roofing from the Roof Structure, or argue that it needed to be treated differently from the Roof Structure. The only photo of the Separate Roofing was found in the affidavit filed by the Plaintiff’s expert, and not in any of the affidavits filed by the Plaintiff’s representatives. When I delivered brief grounds of my decision on 21 January 2020, Plaintiff’s counsel raised the issue of the Separate Roofing and asked that it be considered. Defendant’s counsel argued that the issue of the Separate Roofing has not been clearly pleaded or separately argued.

72     I have reviewed the Plaintiff’s affidavits and submissions. Whilst they did not separately deal with the Separate Roofing or argue that it had to be dealt with differently from the Roof Structure, it was nevertheless alluded too. Plaintiff’s counsel also raised the Separate Roofing at the hearing on 1 November 2019. I therefore proceed to consider whether my views on the four issues listed at \[9\] would differ vis-à-vis the Separate Roofing (as opposed to the Roof Structure).

73     On the first issue, if the Roof Structure did not increase the Development’s GFA, I could not see how the Separate Roofing would do so.

74     On the second issue, the Separate Roofing could not have affected the appearance of any building. This is because it lays flush on the rooftop and cannot be seen unless the observer is standing at the rooftop (which is not accessible to the public or other occupiers).

75     On the third issue, my views on the lack of evidence establishing that the Roof Structure is “a nuisance or hazard” are equally applicable to the Separate Roofing. The Plaintiff’s expert did not distinguish between the Roof Structure and Separate Roofing in coming to his views.

76     On the fourth issue, whilst the Separate Roofing could be said to be resting on part of the rooftop, which is common property, it is not clear that the Separate Roofing has “mark\[ed\], paint\[ed\], driven\[n\] nails or screws or the like into, or otherwise damage\[d\] or deface\[d\]” the common property. I observe that there appears to some nails or screws affixed to the Separate Roofing, but I am unable to tell from the photos if they are affixed to the rooftop, which is common property, or to something else within the Defendants’ lot. I do not think the photos tendered by the Plaintiff are sufficient to establish a breach. Consequently, I am unable to conclude that the Separate Roofing breached Statutory By-Law 5(1).

## Conclusion

77     For the reasons set out above, I therefore dismissed DC/OSS 81/2019. However, I ordered that the Defendants bear the reasonable costs of the Plaintiff engaging a Qualified Person to check the Development’s Lightning Protection System. If it is found that as as result of the erection of the Roof Structure the Lighting Protection System has to be re-certified, the Defendants are to bear the reasonable costs of the re-certification.

78     On 21 January 2020, I provided to the parties brief oral grounds of my decision. After hearing parties’ costs submissions, I fixed costs at $3,500 (all in) to be paid by the Plaintiff to the Defendants.
