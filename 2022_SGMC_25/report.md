### District Judge Sharmila Sripathy-Shanaz:

## Introduction

1       The Accused contested a charge under s 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Penal Code”) for outraging the modesty of the Complainant by touching her vagina over her underwear and exposing her vagina by pulling her underwear aside, during a massage on the afternoon of 27 November 2018.

2       At the close of the trial, having heard the evidence and considered the parties’ submissions, I convicted the Accused and sentenced him to 12 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane.

3       The Accused, being dissatisfied, has filed an appeal against his conviction and sentence. He remains on bail pending the hearing of the appeal. I provide an outline of the evidence led at trial before setting out the grounds of my decision.

## The Prosecution’s Case

4       In presenting its case, the Prosecution called eight witnesses. As an order under s 7(3) of the State Courts Act 1970 (2007 Rev Ed) is in force to protect the identity of the Complainant, the names of several material witnesses have been replaced with an alphabetic mnemonic in these grounds:

> a.     PW2 – the Complainant’s friend; **“Ms B”**

> b.     PW3 – the Complainant’s friend; **“Ms H”**

> c.     PW4 – the Complainant’s friend; **“Ms V”**

> d.     PW5 – the Complainant’s partner; **“Ms N”**

> e.     PW7 – the Complainant’s and Accused’s colleague; **“Ms G”**

### The Complainant’s Evidence

5       The Complainant was the main witness for the Prosecution. The following is a summary of her evidence.

#### The parties relationship

6       The Complainant, a performer, became acquainted with the Accused in 2015 when he worked part-time at the same company for a period of time. They remained in infrequent contact over social media until sometime in October 2018 when the Complainant learnt that the Accused had his own a chiropractic clinic (“the Clinic”) and decided to engage his services as she was dissatisfied with the free physiotherapy sessions provided by her company and wanted to try a chiropractic treatment with someone she knew so that she would feel safe.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

#### The first session on 6 October 2018

7       The Complainant’s first session with the Accused was at his Clinic in Orchard Road on 6 October 2018. After examining her, the Accused told the Complainant that he would perform a deep tissue massage as her ankles were not aligned. He cautioned her that it would be painful as he would be pressing her muscles. The Complainant complied with the Accused’s instructions, removed her t-shirt and lay prone on the massage bed dressed in her sports bra and leggings. She recalled the Accused pressing her ‘glutes’ and thighs before massaging her upper and lower back, shoulders and arms. Describing the experience, the Complainant testified:[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2)

> \[S\]o, uh, he will press down and it---**I really felt the pain** (sic) **I had to jerk** and **sometimes we needed to stop and slow down and then he will press again, and then I will jerk and flinch, because like I really cannot take it**. So we will slow down again. Yah. So actually I---the deep tissue massage really took quite a while because we did like some pauses in between.

(emphasis added)

8       After the deep tissue massage, the Accused performed bone realignment therapy on the Complainant which involved ‘cracking’ various parts of her body.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) The Complainant testified that though it was her _“first experience with bone realignment and deep tissue massage”_, the Accused was _“very professional”_ and his service was _“good”_.[^4]

9       Several days after the session, the Accused contacted the Complainant and enquired if she would be interested in serving as an ambassador for the Clinic. The parties met in person on 10 November 2018 to discuss the proposal which entailed the Complainant posting videos (on social media) of the Accused performing bone realignment therapy on her, in return for a 10% fee and free chiropractic sessions for every successful referral.[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5) The proposal did not require the Complainant to post videos of her receiving a deep tissue massage because it was painful and the Accused was concerned that prospective clients would be _“scared when they see the screaming.”_[^6]

10     The Complainant agreed to the offer as she found the Accused’s service _“quite good”_.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7) The parties arranged to meet at the Clinic on 27 November 2018 for the Accused to record a trial video of bone realignment therapy being performed on the Complainant. Several days prior to the meeting however, the Accused sought to move the location of the recording to the Complainant’s apartment (“the Apartment”) as he was encountering difficulties with the lease of the Clinic. Despite her initial hesitation, the Complainant acceded to the Accused’s request as she _“trusted him”_ and was re-assured that his colleague, **Mr A**, whom she was acquainted with, would also be present. Nonetheless, the Complainant informed the Accused that the trial recording would have to be performed in the living room as her bedroom was too small.[^8]

#### The incident on 27 November 2018

11     After a slight delay owing to the Complainant having overslept, the Accused and Mr A arrived at the Apartment at about 3.00 p.m. on 27 November 2018. The Complainant’s housemate was present at the material time but remained in his room.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9) The Accused set-up a portable massage bed in the living room and began performing bone realignment therapy on the Complainant while Mr A took several photographs and videos of the service rendered.[^10]

12     After completing the bone realignment therapy on the Complainant, the Accused told Mr A to stop recording as he already had a client for the deep tissue massage segment of the video. Mr A complied. The Accused then continued to massage the Complainant as she lay prone on the massage bed in the living room. The Complainant testified that she was confused when she learnt that the Accused was going to perform a deep tissue massage on her as she had not expected him to do so:[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11)

> 
| 

\[D\]anial, uh, continued to massage---uh, he asked me to lie down on my belly and he continued to massage my glutes and he said that he will perform the deep tissue massage. Uh, **I was confused because we only agreed on the bone alignment**, but because, um, **I trusted that he is the professional, so I thought that the deep tissue and the bone alignment should go together. So I let him perform the deep tissue massage** first on my glutes area. I also did---was not feeling any pain at that day … \[we had\] agreed to meet up because of the bone alignment.

(emphasis added)

 |

  
  

13     As the Accused massaged the Complainant’s ‘glutes’, he told her that there would be friction and asked for lotion as he had forgotten to bring his. The Complainant told him that she had lotion in her bedroom and proceeded to retrieve the same. The Accused followed her into the room while Mr A remained in the living room.[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12) This surprised the Complainant who explained, _“we’re not close friend (sic) and considering that he’s a male, to go into my bedroom, I felt scared.”_ Despite her initial apprehension, the Complainant told herself not to be _“paranoid’_ and acquiesced to the Accused’s suggestion to have the massage in her room since he had massaged her once before without incident.[^13]

14     As the Accused’s portable massage bed could not fit into the room, the Complainant placed a mattress on the floor. The Accused closed the door to the room and began massaging the Complainant’s ‘glutes’ as she lay prone. In the course of doing so, he asked the Complainant to remove her shorts as they were too thick. Although uncomfortable with the request, she complied as the Accused assured her that he routinely massaged his other clients in their underwear:[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14)

> 
| 

I was scared, but he was assuring me that the other athletes and the other sports professionals that he massages are also in their underwear … when he was telling me this, I trusted him, that it’s normal to be in underwear when doing the massage, even though inside I was uncomfortable because I was female and he is a male … so I did remove my shorts and put it at the side \[…\]

 |

  
  

15     After massaging the Complainant’s glutes, the Accused began massaging her inner thighs. As he massaged upwards, from her knees, he touched the right side of the Complainant’s vagina over her panties. This happened three to five times as he massaged the length of the Complainant’s inner thigh on her right leg. The Accused then moved to the Complainant’s left leg and similarly touched the left side of her vagina over her panties three to five times as he massaged the length of her inner thigh on her left leg. The Complainant did not react as she was afraid of aggravating the situation:[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15)

> 
| 

I lie down back again on my belly, on the same mattress and then he continued massaging my glutes area and then afterwards, he massaged my inner thighs. So it’s **from the knee height going upwards, he massaged and then he touched my vagina over my panties.** And at first I was shocked and I thought that maybe it was an accident, but then **he kept on repeating it, massaging my inner thighs and going up, touching my vagina with his fingers. He repeated it like 3 to 5 times** and then---after that he did again, **did the same thing on the other side: he massaged my inner thighs, the knee height going upwards towards vagina and then he touched my vagina again while I was wearing underwear** and then it was quite a long time, like **3 to 5 times**, but **I’m scared to retaliate or do something because things might get worse from there, so I acted normal.**

**\[…\]**

\[I\] was scared, because---at first I was thinking like maybe its an accident, but because it was repeatedly done, then I thought that it’s on purpose and **I got scared because if I do something, like what will happen, like can it worsen the situation? So I kept calm and just acted normal.**

(emphasis added)

 |

  
  

16     On this occasion, unlike the first massage session on 6 October 2018, the Complainant testified that she did not feel any pain when the Accused massaged her ‘glutes’ and inner thighs:

> 
| 

 | 

Examination-in-Chief [^16]

 |
| 

A

 | 

\[A\]fter my glutes area he massaged my inner thigh \[sic\] I was lying down on my belly, so it was also my right leg that he massaged with his right hand and **it was a smooth massage, like the normal massages you can get outside.** It’s **not like when we did the first time at his clinic, that it was painful**. **This time around it was just like a normal pressing upwards motion** … there was **no pressing downwards.** There was **no pressure going downwards** and **I didn’t feel pain**, it was more of the **relaxing massage** and the motion was going upwards from my knees, until he touched my vagina.

 |
| 

 | 

Cross Examination [^17]

 |
| 

A

 | 

\[w\]hen we went to the bedroom on November 27th, it wasn’t either … **it was a different kind of massage. It was lighter than the deep tissue massage.**

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And at no point in time during this deep tissue massage did you let out any sounds of pain or discomfort?

 |
| 

A

 | 

On 27 November, yes, **I didn’t feel any discomfort.**

 |
| 

Q

 | 

You didn’t make any sounds that suggest you were---

 |
| 

A

 | 

No.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

**So that massage on October 6th was painful, but this massage in a bedroom on 27th November was not?**

 |
| 

A

 | 

**Yes, correct.**

 |
| 

 | 

(emphasis added)

 |

  
  

17     At this juncture of the massage (after the massage of her inner thighs and ‘glutes’ had concluded), the Complainant, at the Accused’s behest, removed her top and the massage continued with her clad only in her sports bra and panties. In the midst of massaging the Complainant’s left shoulder, the Accused informed her that he had to respond to a message on his mobile phone. Having done so, he asked the Complainant to turn-over so he could massage the front of her body. She complied. As she lay in a supine position, the Accused began massaging the length of her left inner thigh, above her knee. As he did so, he touched the left side of the Complainant’s vagina over her underwear three to five times. Without her consent, he then pushed the Complainant’s panties sideways, opening it _“halfway”_ such that her vagina was exposed, and concurrently used his right hand to massage her left lower abdomen. This lasted for one to two minutes.[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18) At this stage of the massage, the Accused was no longer using any lotion.[^19]

18     After releasing her underwear, the Accused moved to the Complainant’s right leg and similarly touched the right side of her vagina over her underwear three to five times as he massaged the length of her inner right thigh, above her knee. Again, without her consent, he then pushed the Complainant’s panties sideways, such that her vagina was exposed and concurrently used his right hand to massage her right lower abdomen.[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20)

19     With the aid of Exhibit P3 the Complainant testified that ‘E’ (“Area E”) denoted where the Accused had touched her vagina, both as she lay prone and thereafter supine.[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21)

20     At the end of the massage, the Complainant had to move her underwear back into position as it was _“stuck halfway at the middle of \[her\] vagina”_.[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22) She clothed herself and returned to the living room with the Accused.

21     Though _“scared”_ and _“confused”_, the Complainant tried to _“act normal”_ as she was alone in the Apartment with the Accused and Mr A, her housemate having left the house during the early stages of the massage.[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23) The trio engaged in brief conversation for approximately ten minutes while the Accused ate some food the Complainant had prepared for the duo prior to their arrival at the Apartment.[^24] The Complainant explained her frame of mind during this time, in the following terms:[^25]

> 
| 

A

 | 

\[H\]e was acting normal, so **I try to calm myself and act normal**. \[Mr A\] was there, still eating, and they ate the food and, um, we just discussed about the videos, like were the angles okay? Um, we didn’t discuss anything about what happened in my room. And after that, I think around 10 minutes, they left.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And why didn’t you say anything or voice anything to the accused?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, **I was scared because my housemate was no longer there. I was left with two of them** and I don’t know if \[Mr A\] was in it, if he was the one behind the---like the other line when \[the Accused\] was texting. So **I was really scared and I just want them to leave the house, so I’m like safe inside, so I didn’t do or react to anything.**

 |
| 

 | 

(emphasis added)

 |

  
  

#### Exchange of text messages with Ms B

22     At about 7.30 p.m., the Complainant contacted Ms B, a friend who was a physiotherapist, as she wanted to speak to a professional in a field similar to the Accused’s because she was _“confused with what \[she\] should feel”_. In a series of text messages between Ms B and the Complainant, adduced by the Prosecution as Exhibit P5, the latter recounted several aspects of how the incident unfolded (reproduced below in verbatim and uncorrected):[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26)

> 
| 

\[I\] didn’t know if I was molested or I should just take it as just a massage … \[I\] have a collaboration with my friend who is a chiro. Then we need to take a video of the sound of the carck (sic) on the back. I will help \[him\] promote \[his\] business and then shoot (film) in the house along with the videographer. Initially it was just okay then when it’s the turn to massage the muscle **\[the Accused\] asked for lotion so that there’s no friction on the skin**.. **thereafter \[he\] followed in the room. I said no need as there’s no space.** Able to do on the floor (according to the person) as in there’s a mattress, like that. So the videographer was left behind in the living room. Then subsequently I became confused if it’s correct or what. **\[He\] asked me to take my shorts off as otherwise will not be able to reach the tissue and the muscles.** So I thought that it was just a normal massage. It was just slightly awkward as he was a guy … Because according to him, he would also ask his male client to do the same. **The weird part was when the lower abdomen area was massaged as he had slightly adjusted the panty to the side. So my feeling was that he must have seen my private part.** So that’s why I want to know if that was natural. **It was really weird because the massage was not even, I didn’t know if he got distracted** already or what … **I almost cry and confused at the same time.** Because, you know the **feeling of as if I just let it happened** … but **actually I didn’t know that there was a deep tissue massage. Because I thought it would just be done at the living room area.** I didn’t know what to do, on how to say that I was feeling awkward. **Only 1 side of the back was done.** Haaaay feeling heavy inside … more than 30mins … I still don’t know how that happened. **I was played with mind games** … I’m really confused. You know **the feeling of as if I have got swindled.**

(emphasis added)

#### Exchange of text messages with the Accused

23     A log of text messages between the Complainant and the Accused several hours after the incident, was also tendered in evidence as Exhibit P6. Salient parts of this exchange are reproduced below in verbatim and uncorrected (with ‘C’ and ‘D’ to connote messages from the Complainant and Accused, respectively):

> 
| 

C

 | 

\[A\]ctually I need to ask a question…**why did you do the massage on me?**

 |
| 

D

 | 

My treatments consist of bones alignment and deep muscle release.

 |
| 

C

 | 

I see. Since it’s part of the treatment, why wasn’t it recorded as well?

 |
| 

 | 

\[…\]

 |
| 

C

 | 

Dont get me wrong yeah, I need to ask you these questions because as a woman, **i felt kinda violated**. Reason why i asked is because **i was very uncomfortable when you were doing the massage** on me **particularly on my privates area. You pushed my underwear aside exposing my vagina while massaging without asking for consent.** Come to think of it, you couldve asked me to wear looser shorts or provided you with a towel but that didnt happen. You took out your phone while massaging my butt area which made me uncomfortable as my body was exposed. Why are you using your phone while giving me the treatment to begin with? Technology and social media are used in so many ways these days, any one would be paranoid into thinking that photos were taken without consent and spread online. With all due respect, i know youre a professional sports therapist, but **if it includes exposing my privates and such shouldnt you have asked me if i was ok first? Furthermore, why was your fingers touching my vagina when you were massaging up my thighs?**

 |
| 

D

 | 

First and foremost I deeply sincerely want to apologise to you for being too blunt and wasn’t being sensitive. I’m humbly n sincerely sorry. I can promise you no pictures were taken, as I was replying sms everynow and then. In my absent mind i didn’t think the possibly of my actions of using hp can make people think of taking picture. I’m not making excuses but i was on my phone throughout the whole sessions, even when we’re facing each other, i won’t be that blunt to snap pictures when you’re looking.

2ndly i was being very careful not to expose any privates as I respect everyone privacy. I’m too complacent with my mind thinking the other ambassador i didn’t use any towel on her before as i always pull her tights up (i need to look into this) I know i might sound making excuses but the release of hip flexor is done to everyone (refer to the last video i send) in regards my fingers touching to vagina, i honestly did not realise it at all. I’m very much focus trying to release all the deep muscles while moving my fingers up and down.

I know all this sounds like i’m making an excuse, but honestly due to my bluntness and complacent i’ve overlooked on all this sensitive area. Be it the male and female i did the same. I should have taken extra careful when doing onto females. I sincerely apologize for what happened. If you wish to pull out from being the ambassador i understand. I won’t blame you. Once again i apologize what happened earlier. I will take note of my mistakes and change it.

 |
| 

C

 | 

Thank you for understanding my fears and concerns. I hope i didnt offend you by expressing my thoughts and feelings**. I didnt mentioned it before as i thought i was overthinking it, But i realized later that I was deeply disturbed by it and thats why I decided to ask you directly.** Im glad that there is no foul intentions on your end. And rest assured i would not be spreading anything negative on my end either.

I hope you understand my intentions to withdraw from your offer to be your company’s ambassador.

I would also appreciate it if you don’t use the materials that we recorded earlier as well. I am deeply sorry. I hope you understand.

My sincerest wishes to you for your future endeavours.

 |
| 

D

 | 

Thank you, for texting me straight and clarify things out. I truly understand where you coming from. Thank you for alerting me as i will be more careful and cautious when doing with female patient. Once again \[C\] i appreciate the kind gesture for not spreading the negative experience. I really am. I’ve deleted the uploads too.

(emphasis added)

#### Impact of the incident on the Complainant

24     At trial, the Complainant expressed the impact of the incident on her in the following terms:[\[note: 27\]](#Ftn_27)

> 
| 

I still don’t know how he was able to touch my private parts repeatedly and---in a way **I’m, like angry with myself, because at 27 years old I still let him do that to me.** Like after the incident, when, uh---like at work, while I was recounting what happened, in my mind I’m like there was---**I should have stopped him, I should have run out, I should have called for help or something, but I was stuck there and I was, um, confused and that’s why I keep on saying I still don’t know** how that happened---**how I let it happened** (sic).

 |
| 

(emphasis added)

 |

  
  

### The Evidence of Ms H, Ms V and Ms N

25     Ms H and Ms V (the Complainant’s friends) as well as Ms N (her partner), were material witnesses for the Prosecution. Ms H testified that the Complainant was crying as she revealed that the Accused had _“violated”_ her during a massage when he was _“going up her thighs”_ and _“touch\[ed\] her at \[her\] private areas.”_[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28)

26     Ms V recounted the Complainant divulging that her vagina had been _“exposed”_ during a massage performed by the Accused. Ms V described the Complainant as _“emotional”_ as she relayed what had happened.[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29) Though Ms H and Ms V were unable to recall the precise date of the above exchange, the Defence did not appear to dispute that the aforesaid disclosures had taken place on 27 November 2018 (i.e., the date of the incident).[^30]

27     Ms N recalled the Complainant telling her that the Accused had _“moved her panty to expose her vagina”_ during the massage when she was lying on her back.[\[note: 31\]](#Ftn_31) Ms N stated that the Complainant was very distraught, _“crying profusely”_ and _“shaking”_ as she recounted the incident.[^32] It was similarly not in dispute that this exchange had occurred on 27 November 2018.

### Summary of the Prosecution’s Submissions

28     Relying on the Complainant’s evidence, text messages between the parties, admissions in the Accused’s police statements (which were admitted in evidence as Exhibit P10 and Exhibit P11),[\[note: 33\]](#Ftn_33) as well as deficiencies in the Defence’s case which rendered the Accused’s evidence highly incredible,[^34] the Prosecution submitted that it had proven the charge beyond a reasonable doubt.

29     In this regard, it was submitted that:

> a.     the Complainant’s evidence was ‘unusually convincing’ and sufficiently established the _actus reus_ of the offence;[\[note: 35\]](#Ftn_35)

> b.     on the issue of the _mens rea_ of the offence, the Accused’s claims that he had touched the Complainant’s vagina accidentally ought to be rejected as it was at odds with his admission in Exhibit P10, as well as his concession (under cross-examination) that he could not have ‘accidentally’ touched the Complainant’s vagina 12 to 20 times;[\[note: 36\]](#Ftn_36) and

> c.     similarly, the Accused’s claim that he had obtained the Complainant’s consent before moving her underwear should be rejected in light of the inherent inconsistencies within the Defence’s case.[\[note: 37\]](#Ftn_37)

30     As regards the Defence’s reliance on Mr A’s evidence, the Prosecution submitted that his evidence should be given limited weight.[\[note: 38\]](#Ftn_38)

## The Defence’s Case

31     The Accused called several witnesses in his defence:

> a.     DW2 – Ms Diyanah Aqidah Binte Muhammad Dian Khudhair (**“Ms Diyanah”)**; the Accused’s client,

> b.     DW3 – Ms Lim Cheng Kuan (**“Ms Lim”**); a physiotherapist

> c.     DW4 – **Mr A**; the Accused’s friend and colleague.

32     In the ancillary hearing convened to determine the voluntariness of Exhibits P10 and P11, the Accused called his cousin, AH-DW2 (“**Mr J**”).

### The Accused’s Evidence

33     The Accused’s evidence, as gleaned from his testimony, is summarized below.

34     At their first session on 6 October 2018, the Accused performed bone realignment therapy on the Complainant after using a massage gun to loosen her trigger points. After manipulating her pelvic bones, the Complainant removed her top for the Accused to perform a deep tissue release on her upper body. During the massage, _“there \[were\] a few grunts, screams”_ because the Complainant was in pain.[\[note: 39\]](#Ftn_39)

35     After the session, the Accused contacted the Complainant to enquire if she was interested in serving as an ambassador for the Clinic. Under the terms of the proposal, the Complainant would promote the Accused’s services on social media by posting videos and pictures of him performing bone alignment therapy and deep tissue massage on her. In return for each successful client referral, the Complainant would receive a _“10% commission”_ as well as two full sessions of bone manipulation therapy and deep tissue massage every month. [\[note: 40\]](#Ftn_40)

36     The Complainant agreed to the Accused’s proposal and liaised with Mr A on the arrangements for the trial recording session. A trial session was necessary to assist Mr A in determining which angle best captured the sound of cracking bones and an adequate amount of light. According to the Accused, the trial session applied to both bone realignment therapy and a deep tissue massage being performed on the Complainant.[\[note: 41\]](#Ftn_41) As the Accused no longer had space at the Clinic, Mr A arranged for the trial session to be held at the Apartment.[^42]

37     On the afternoon of 27 November 2018, the Accused and Mr A arrived at the Apartment and setup a portable massage bed in the living room. The trial session began with the Accused performing bone manipulation on the Complainant for between 20 to 30 minutes. Thereafter, the Accused assisted the Complainant with some _“light stretches”_ to get her ready for the deep tissue massage. According to the Accused, this was the first time he was performing a deep tissue massage on the Complainant. He did not brief her on what to expect.[\[note: 43\]](#Ftn_43) The deep tissue massage was not recorded but the Accused explained that he performed it on the Complainant _“so that when she explained to her followers, her followers \[would\] know what to expect then they \[came for\] a session.”_[^44]

38     After completing the light stretches, the Accused asked the Complainant for lotion as he had left his tub of cream in his car. The Complainant proceeded to her bedroom to look for the cream while the Accused remaining in the living room with Mr A and reviewed the videos that had been taken earlier. The Complainant eventually returned to the living room, presented the Accused with body lotion and asked, _“is this okay?”_ The Accused checked the lotion for consistency and found it suitable. He then asked the Complainant if she wanted to have the massage in her room or living room for _“privacy matters”._ He did not inform the Complainant that she would be required to undress.[\[note: 45\]](#Ftn_45)

39     As the Complainant expressed some concern about whether the portable massage bed would fit in her room, the Accused suggested that she take a look to determine if there was any angle at which the bed could be set-up. The Complainant invited the Accused to her room to see whether the space was conducive. Upon determining that the room was _“very, very small”_, the Accused told the Complainant, _“hey, I don’t think this is able to do inside.”_ She then informed him that she had a mattress and asked if it was suitable. As it was _“doable”_, the Complainant placed the mattress on the floor and lay prone on it.[\[note: 46\]](#Ftn_46)

40     The Accused began massaging the Complainant’s left calf and hamstring. When he progressed to her ‘glutes’, the Complainant began _“flinching her body”, “squirming in pain, shouting \[and\] grunting”_ to indicate that she was in pain. As such, the Accused used his middle finger and ring finger, instead of his thumb, to massage her ‘glutes’. As this resulted in less pressure, the Accused asked the Complainant if she wished to remove her shorts as he thought it might be _“too thick”_ and he did not want to _“dirty”_ her shorts with lotion. The Complainant agreed and removed her shorts.[\[note: 47\]](#Ftn_47) As her underwear still covered her ‘glutes’, the Accused informed the Complainant that he would be _“pushing \[her\] underwear upwards a bit”_ to massage the ‘glutes’. She said _“okay.”_[^48] When he was done, the Accused did the same to the Complainant’s right leg.[^49]

41     Thereafter, the Accused asked the Complainant to turn over. As she lay supine and the Accused massaged her right shin, the Complainant was _“grunting”_ and _“screaming in pain”_. After some time, the Accused moved on to massage her _“quads”_. [\[note: 50\]](#Ftn_50) When he moved to the Complainant’s adductors[^51] located near her _“groin area”_, he told her that _“similar to the glutes \[he needed\] to push the underwear a bit for \[him\] to access the abductors (sic) area.”_ She said _“okay”_, and the Accused proceeded to push her underwear _“upwards”_, _“towards her hip”_ with his thumb. The Complainant was _“flinching’_ and _“expressing in pain_” while he released her adductors.[^52]

42     When he was done, the Accused did the same to the Complainant’s left leg. Again, when he reached her adductors, the Accused told the Complainant that he would be shifting her underwear upwards. She agreed and he pushed her underwear up towards her hips and held it there for 5 to 10 seconds.[\[note: 53\]](#Ftn_53)

43     The Accused then asked the Complainant to turn over and remove her tank top. She complied. As she lay prone, the Accused massaged her lower back and neck. According to the Accused, the Complainant was _“flinching in pain”_, _“grunting and screaming”_ throughout the process.[\[note: 54\]](#Ftn_54) The massage ended after the Accused had massaged the Complainant’s chest muscles as she lay supine.[^55]

44     The Accused testified that he had used his mobile phone during the massage and texted Mr A to discuss where they would eat after the session. This exchange was tendered in evidence as Exhibit D4. After the massage, the Accused and the Complainant proceeded to the living room and had a _“good conversation”_ with Mr A for 20 to 30 minutes while eating the food the Complainant had prepared for them earlier. The Accused teased the Complainant about how she had _“screamed”_ during the massage and she responded by laughing. Mr A also commented that he was able to hear the Complainant’s screams from the living room. [\[note: 56\]](#Ftn_56) As they parted ways, the Complainant gave the Accused a hug.[^57]

45     The Accused denied the charge, claiming that he had been _“falsely accused”_. He asserted that while there was a _“possibility”_ that he could have touched or brushed against the Complainant’s vagina during the massage when she was flinching, he had been _“very careful not to”_ do so. [\[note: 58\]](#Ftn_58)

### The Evidence of Mr A

46     Mr A testified that he was a _“very close”_ friend of the Accused and an acquaintance of the Complainant. He had been working for the Accused at the time of the incident and remains (after a hiatus) in his employ.[\[note: 59\]](#Ftn_59)

47     According to Mr A, the Complainant had prepared food for him and the Accused on the afternoon of 27 November 2018 to apologize for having overslept and delayed their appointment.[\[note: 60\]](#Ftn_60) The session began with the Accused performing bone manipulation on the Complainant in the living room while Mr A shot videos and photographs of them.[^61]

48     Once this was completed, Mr A testified that he recalled the Accused asking the Complainant if she wished to continue with the massage in the living room. The Accused also asked the Complainant for cream/lotion as he had forgotten to bring his. Mr A testified however, that he _“didn’t really hear and see”_ the whole conversation and interaction between the Accused and the Complainant.[\[note: 62\]](#Ftn_62)

49     According to Mr A, the Complainant and the Accused proceeded to the room for a massage while he remained in the living room where he reviewed the photographs and videos he had shot earlier, and thereafter occupied himself on Facebook, playing on his mobile phone and watching videos.[\[note: 63\]](#Ftn_63) According to Mr A, he heard some _“shouts coming from the room”_ during the massage but was otherwise _“lost in \[his\] own world.”_[^64] In the midst of the massage, Mr A messaged the Accused to let him know that he was hungry.

50     According to Mr A, when the Accused and the Complainant subsequently returned to the living room, they were both _“laughing and chitchatting”_ about her reaction to the pain.[\[note: 65\]](#Ftn_65) Mr A likewise laughed about the shouting and screaming he had heard whilst in the living room. The Complainant exclaimed that the massage had been very painful. The trio then engaged in conversation about their mutual friends as well as the Complainant’s arrangement to serve as the Clinic’s ambassador. As they parted ways soon after, the Complainant hugged the Accused.[^66]

51     Mr A learnt of the allegations several days later when the Accused drove to see him and relayed what the Complainant had said against him. Mr A was purportedly _“very shocked”_, _“because during that time when \[they\] were there, it was a lot of laughter \[and\] happiness \[and\] it was a very positive setting before and after.”_ He testified that he _“couldn’t feel any negative vibes coming from anyone”_ and the trio were _“excited to go on this venture together.”_ He thus wondered why the Complainant had levelled the allegations against the Accused.[\[note: 67\]](#Ftn_67)

52     In relation to the Complainant’s first session with the Accused in October 2018, Mr A testified that he was present in the reception area of the Clinic. He was aware that the Complainant had undergone both bone realignment therapy and a deep tissue massage but could not recall if she had screamed on this occasion, or whether she had hugged the Accused before leaving.[\[note: 68\]](#Ftn_68)

### Summary of the Defence’s Submissions

53     Relying on the Accused’s evidence, the Defence submitted that the Accused had not intentionally touched the Complainant’s vagina 12 to 20 times during the massage. Instead, any contact with the Complainant’s vagina had occurred _“inadvertently”_ when she flinched and squirmed as he massaged her.[\[note: 69\]](#Ftn_69) The Defence further asserted that the Accused had moved the Complainant’s underwear with her consent and in a manner that did not expose her vagina.[^70]

54     In evaluating the evidence, the Defence submitted, _inter alia_, that the Court should accept the Accused’s testimony as it was corroborated by the Defence witnesses.[\[note: 71\]](#Ftn_71) In contrast, the Defence urged the Court to reject the Complainant’s account as she had not provided ‘unusually convincing’ testimony given the internal[^72] and external[^73] inconsistencies in her evidence and her confusion as to whether she had been molested.[^74]

55     Additionally, the Defence submitted that no weight should be placed on Exhibit P10 as there were several purported procedural irregularities in the recording of the statement which rendered it unreliable.[\[note: 75\]](#Ftn_75)

## The Applicable Legal Principles

56     It is settled law that the uncorroborated evidence of a complainant may be the sole basis for a conviction. However, such evidence must be “unusually convincing”: see _Public Prosecutor v GCK_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 486</span> (“_GCK_”) at \[87\]; _Haliffie bin Mamat v Public Prosecutor and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 636</span> at \[28\]; _AOF v Public Prosecutor_ \[2012\] 3 SLR 3 at \[111\] and _Public Prosecutor v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 601</span> (“_Liton_”) at \[37\].

57     In _GCK_ at \[88\], the Court of Appeal stated that the ‘unusually convincing’ standard is used to describe a situation where the witness’s testimony is “so convincing that the Prosecution’s case \[is\] proven beyond reasonable doubt, solely on the basis of the evidence”. As to what would constitute ‘unusually convincing’ evidence, the Court of Appeal observed as follows:

> 88    … in \[_Haliffie_\], this court considered that (citing _\[Liton_\] at \[39\]):

>> … complainant’s testimony would be unusually convincing if the testimony, ‘when weighed against the overall backdrop of the available facts and circumstances, contains that ring of truth which leaves the court satisfied that no reasonable doubt exists in favour of the accused’.

> The relevant considerations in this regard include the witness’ demeanour, and the internal and external consistencies of the witness’s evidence.

58     At \[92\] of _GCK_, the Court of Appeal stressed that the ‘unusually convincing’ standard is not meant to impose a mandatory warning from the judge to himself or herself. At the last stage of the evaluation of the evidence and just before a conviction is found, it serves as a cautionary reminder to ensure that the trial judge has an awareness of the dangers of convicting the offender on uncorroborated evidence, and that he or she undertakes a rigorous and holistic assessment of the evidence.

59     Where the evidence of a complainant is not ‘unusually convincing’, an accused’s conviction is unsafe unless there is some corroboration of the complainant’s evidence: see _Liton_ at \[37\]. As to what can amount to corroborative evidence, the strict approach is set out in _R v Baskerville_ <span class="citation">\[1916\] 2 KB 658</span> at 667 and requires independent evidence implicating the accused in a material particular. However, in the local context, a more liberal approach is advocated and the trial judge retains the necessary flexibility to treat relevant evidence as corroborative. What is important is the substance as well as the relevance of the evidence, and whether it is supportive or confirmative of the weak evidence which it is meant to corroborate: see _Liton_ at \[42\] – \[43\].

60     The more liberal approach treats a subsequent complaint made by the complainant as corroboration provided that the statement implicating the offender was made at the first reasonable opportunity after the commission of the offence: see _AOF_ at \[173\] citing _Public Prosecutor v Mardai_ <span class="citation">\[1950\] MLJ 33</span>.

61     With this framework in mind, I turn to analyse the evidence that was before me.

## The Complainant’s Account was Highly Compelling

62     Having scrutinized the evidence, I was satisfied that the Complainant was an ‘unusually convincing’ witness who provided cogent, textured and compelling testimony. I explain.

### The Complainant’s Evidence was Internally Consistent

63     I found the Complainant’s evidence to be internally consistent for several reasons.

64     First, her vivid and granular description of the incident (_supra_ at \[11\] to \[21\]) remained unshaken under cross-examination and rendered her evidence compelling. Foremost, contrary to the Accused’s claim that he had performed a deep tissue massage on the Complainant, was the latter’s unequivocal and _unchallenged_ evidence that the very _nature_ of the massage performed by the Accused on the day in question, was diametrically different to what she had previously experienced in his clinic.[\[note: 76\]](#Ftn_76) In this regard, she explained with clarity that whilst the first massage was _“painful”_, causing her to jerk and flinch in pain,[^77] she did not feel _any_ discomfort during the massage on 27 November 2018 and did not let out any sounds of pain or discomfort[^78] as it was a normal, smooth, relaxing massage with gentle strokes and without any downward pressure or pain[^79] (also detailed at \[16\] above). Her evidence disabused the Court of any notion that the massage performed on the day in question was (as the Accused had claimed) a deep tissue massage.

65     Second, the Complainant was able to provide logical and rational explanations for the various case theories the Accused had sought to advance in his own defence at trial. In response to the Defence’s suggestion that she was mistaken about the molest since she was lying down and did not _see_ the Accused touching her vagina or moving her underwear aside,[\[note: 80\]](#Ftn_80) the Complainant explained that she did not need to see what was being touched to _feel_ (and by extension, _know_) where she had been touched, especially since the incursions had been to her vagina, a particularly sensitive part of her body.[^81]

66     She also roundly rejected any suggestion that she had mistaken the Accused’s massage of her adductors for an intrusion into her vagina, explaining that the two touches were distinct, and that the Accused had touched her vagina _before_ moving her underwear and touching her adductors.[\[note: 82\]](#Ftn_82) This laid to rest any possibility that the Complainant had erroneously conflated the Accused’s massage of her adductors with his touching of her vagina. In my assessment, the likelihood of the Complainant being mistaken as to _where_ she was touched, also greatly receded when one considered the fact that these were _repeated_ intrusions into the vagina and not a solitary, fleeting touch. I also accepted the Complainant’s testimony that the Accused had exposed her vagina as she gave clear evidence that she not only felt him moving her underwear midway across her vagina, but thereafter had to physically readjust her underwear as the Accused had left it _“stuck in the middle”_ of her vagina.[^83] This squarely reinforced what the Complainant had felt earlier and left no doubt for any misperception as to what the Accused had done.

67     The Complainant also steadfastly rejected the Defence’s suggestion that she was unsure about having been molested by the Accused.[\[note: 84\]](#Ftn_84) She categorically stated that she was in no doubt that the impugned acts had occurred and explained that her _feelings_ were confused as her mind was battling with whether the Accused had acted professionally or acknowledge that she had been molested.[^85] The Complainant’s mental turmoil was understandable and highly believable since she not only knew the Accused but also trusted that he would be professional in his interactions with her as he had been during the first massage session in October 2018.

68     Contrary to the Defence’s assertions,[\[note: 86\]](#Ftn_86) I also found nothing incredulous about the Complainant’s initial apprehension at having the massage in the Apartment instead of at the Clinic. Her explanation that she was reticent at first but agreed to the arrangement as she trusted the Accused and was reassured by the presence of Mr A whom she knew,[^87] in fact cohered with her subsequent decision to similarly acquiesce to the massage in her bedroom, despite her initial reluctance.[^88]

69     Equally, there was nothing incredible about the Complainant omitting to clarify whether the deep tissue massage was part of the session planned for 27 November 2018,[\[note: 89\]](#Ftn_89) as she explained that while there was neither an arrangement for the deep tissue massage to be performed that day, nor any reason for a complimentary session to be extended to her since the parties were only making publicity materials and she had yet to refer any clients to the Clinic[^90], she did not refuse the massage[^91] as she trusted what she believed to be the Accused’s professional opinion that the bone alignment therapy and deep tissue massage should go hand-in-hand.[^92] The latter belief coupled with her trust in the Accused’s professionalism, likewise explained why she subsequently retrieved and placed her mattress on the ground, of her own volition, for the massage to be performed.[^93]

70     Third, contrary to the Defence’s submission that the Complainant had provided inconsistent testimony on several issues, I found that the substantive _core_ of her evidence remained unshaken. In this regard, I address the following points raised by the Defence:

> a.     It was asserted that the inconsistency in the Complainant’s testimony as to _when_ the Accused used his mobile phone (whether it was while he was massaging her buttocks as reflected in Exhibit P6 or while he was massaging her shoulder as she testified in Court), rendered her an unreliable witness.[\[note: 94\]](#Ftn_94) I disagree. Quite apart from the fact that the Complainant was not cross-examined on this purported inconsistency, I noted that the Accused himself did not dispute using his mobile phone during the massage. Further, the inconsistency is inconsequential when one considers that the thrust of the Complainant’s evidence, _viz._ that she was alarmed to find the Accused using his mobile phone during the massage while she lay prone and exposed, was undisputed at trial;

> b.     The Defence’s assertion that the Complainant should be disbelieved given the purported inconsistency between her testimony that the Accused had moved her underwear to the middle of her vagina, and Exhibit P5 where she stated that he had adjusted her underwear slightly and must have seen her vagina,[\[note: 95\]](#Ftn_95) was also weak. I did not find any inconsistency stemming from her assertion in the text message that the Accused _“must have seen”_ her private part. It was clear that the assumption there, related to what the Complainant believed the Accused would have _seen_ as opposed to her _physically feeling_ her underwear being moved and her vagina being exposed. The former is an assumption as the Complainant did not know what the _Accused saw_, while the latter was premised on what she _herself_ perceived physically and could therefore attest to. In this regard, the Defence’s submission was flawed. In any event, not only was the Complainant not cross-examined on this purported inconsistency, more pertinently, in both accounts, the Complainant emphatically maintained that the Accused had moved her underwear during the massage and _exposed_ her vagina.

71     Considering the evidence in its entirety, I thus found that the Complainant had given perfectly reasonable explanations in response to the various doubts the Defence had attempted to sow in her testimony.

72     Finally, I did not find the veracity of the Complainant’s testimony to be undermined by the fact that she neither vocalized her discomfort to the Accused nor tried to stop him during the massage. In this regard, I noted the Complainant’s evidence that the Accused’s contact with her vagina had taken place during the massage he was performing on her inner thighs and that he had made it seem like it was part of the massage.[\[note: 96\]](#Ftn_96) It was patent that the Accused had sought to blur the boundaries of what was proper and acceptable and mask his illicit actions by making his touches appear to be part of a legitimate massage and hence, innocuous. The Complainant’s confusion as to what was transpiring, was thus hardly unsurprising. In a similar vein, I found nothing untoward about the Complainant’s evidence that when her initial belief that the contact was accidental, gave way to the realization that the repeated contact with her vagina was purposeful, she still did not react and in fact, tried to act normal as she did not want to risk exacerbating the situation.[^97]

73     Further, while the Defence tried to cast doubt on the Complainant’s allegations by asserting that it was illogical for her to sit and share a meal with the Accused if he had just molested her,[\[note: 98\]](#Ftn_98) I found nothing remiss in the Complainant’s explanation that though she was _“sacred”_ because she was alone with the Accused and Mr A, she did not react or say anything as she was trying to _“calm herself and act normal”_ while waiting for them to leave the house so that she would be safe.[^99]

74     It must be remembered that victims of sexual crimes cannot be straitjacketed in the expectation that they must act or react in a certain manner: _GBR v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 296</span> at \[20\]. In the present case, the Complainant found herself alone in the apartment with two men and her reaction to the Accused’s unexpected and brazen conduct was well within the realm of possibilities, particularly given her slight frame and the Accused’s and Mr A’s substantially bigger build. Thus viewed, I found no merit in the insinuation that the Complainant’s passivity at and around the time of the offence proved that the allegations were concocted.

75     If anything, I found the credibility of the Complainant’s account enhanced by the lack of embellishment of her evidence in Court. It would be recalled that the Complainant had, in the course of her testimony, candidly conceded that she ought to have reacted expressly and directly to the Accused’s actions. She gave voice to her frank expression of regret, in the following terms:[\[note: 100\]](#Ftn_100)

> 
| 

I still don’t know how he was able to touch my private parts repeatedly and --- in a way I’m like angry with myself, because at 27 years old I still let him do that to me … **I should have stopped him, I should have run out, I should have called for help or something, but I was stuck there and I was confused.**

(emphasis added)

 |

  
  

76     She was equally frank in admitting that she was the first person to enter her bedroom to retrieve the massage lotion, though she maintained that she did not invite the Accused into her bedroom, and he had followed her of his own accord. The Complainant’s evidence attesting to the Accused’s professionalism and skill during her first session in the Clinic in October 2018,[\[note: 101\]](#Ftn_101) was also measured and fair. The Complainant’s candor on material aspects of her evidence, bolstered her overall credibility in the eyes of this Court.

77     For all the foregoing reasons, I found that her evidence was internally consistent, and her credibility unassailed.

### The Complainant’s Evidence was Externally Consistent

78     Consistent with the Complainant’s claim that she was molested, were her actions in the hours following the incident. Though she was scared, confused about whether she should call the police and initially did not talk to anyone as she wanted to think through the incident,[\[note: 102\]](#Ftn_102) the evidence shows that she did eventually make _several material disclosures_ about the incident to various individuals.

#### The Complainant disclosed the incident to others

79     At about 7.30 p.m. (less than three hours after the Accused had left the Apartment), the Complainant contacted a friend who was a physiotherapist, as she wanted to speak to a professional in the same field as the Accused.[\[note: 103\]](#Ftn_103) In a series of messages with Ms B, tendered in evidence as Exhibit P5, the Complainant enquired if it was appropriate for a therapist to massage the inner thigh and lower abdomen.[^104] She also recounted several aspects of how the incident unfolded (_supra_ at \[22\]).

80     In particular, the Complainant shared that the Accused had asked for lotion, followed her into her room and thereafter told her that he could massage her on the floor on a mattress when she said that there was no space.[\[note: 105\]](#Ftn_105) She explained that Mr A had remained in the living room. She revealed that the Accused had told her that he would not be able to reach her tissues and muscles if she did not remove her shorts and also told her that he asked the same of his male clients.[^106] The Complainant stated that she felt slightly awkward as the Accused was a guy. She also said she was unsure if the Accused was distracted, revealing that the massage was _“really weird”_ because it _“was not even”_ as only one side of her back was massaged.[^107] She explained that it was not similar to her previous chiropractic session with the Accused.[^108] She further disclosed that when the Accused massaged her lower abdomen, he _“he had slightly adjusted the panty to the side”_, surmised that he must have seen her _“private part”_ and wanted to know if that was _“natural”_ because she did not know if she was molested or _“should take it as just a massage”_.[^109] She also explained that she did not expect a deep tissue massage and did not know what to do or how to say she was feeling awkward.[^110] The Complainant further divulged that she almost cried, was _“confused”_, felt as though she had _“just let it happen”_, was _“feeling heavy inside”_, still did not know how it happened and concluded that she had been _“played with mind games”_.[^111]

81     I found the Complainant’s narration of various aspects of the incident to Ms B (_viz._ on how the Accused had followed her into the room when she went to retrieve the lotion, his suggestion that the massage be conducted in her room, the unevenness/haphazardness of the massage performed on her, the fact that she was not expecting a deep tissue massage on the day in question and the Accused’s adjustment of her underwear to see her private part), to be consistent with her testimony in Court and, given their relative contemporaneity to the incident, to bolster her credibility.

82     Though the Complainant did not, in her messages to Ms B, categorically state that the Accused had touched her vagina, I did not find this to undermine the cogency of her allegations as she satisfactorily explained that the messages were sent in some haste and she was rushing through the details as she was in the midst of rehearsals at work and not permitted to use her phone. She also explained that she wanted to meet Ms B to explain the details to her in person and had only intended to ask her about the more _“unusual things”_ she had experienced, such as the exposing of her vagina and the massage at her lower abdomen, over text message.[\[note: 112\]](#Ftn_112) The Complainant also satisfactorily clarified that she was in no doubt that the act of molest had taken place, but was merely in the midst of processing her feelings about what had transpired[^113] (also addressed at \[67\] above).

83     The evidence also showed that the Complainant had disclosed the incident in person, to two close friends and her partner after leaving work on the same night. Ms H and Ms V testified that the Complainant had spoken to both of them about what had transpired and though neither could remember every detail relayed to them, Ms H recalled the Complainant relating that the Accused had touched her vagina as he massaged her _“going up her thighs”_,[\[note: 114\]](#Ftn_114) whilst Ms V recalled the Complainant relating how the Accused had moved aside what she was wearing and exposed her vagina.[^115] Both women also testified that the Complainant was very emotional, very upset and crying as she narrated the incident to them[^116] (_supra_ at \[25\] – \[26\]).

84     The Complainant’s partner, Ms N, testified that the Complainant had recounted the incident when they met at about midnight. While there were some inconsistencies in Ms N’s evidence,[\[note: 117\]](#Ftn_117) I found that they were not so material as to erode her credibility, and I accept that some allowance must be made for human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection, given the passage of time: _Public Prosecutor v BNO_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 243</span> at \[124\] and _Lim Thiam Hor and Anor v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] SGHC 64</span> at \[21\]. Minor inconsistencies notwithstanding, it was significant that the thrust of Ms N’s evidence was that she recalled the Complainant telling her that the Accused had massaged her thighs and moved her underwear to expose her vagina.[^118] It was also Ms N’s evidence that the Complainant was crying profusely and was very shaken, distraught and lost as she recounted the incident.[^119] While the passage of time might have blurred Ms N’s memory vis-à-vis what she was told about the incident, it was clear that the Complainant’s patent distress and visceral reaction to the incident left a deep and indelible impression on Ms N, a fact that she herself attested to.[^120]

85     While the four witnesses are the Complainant’s friends and partner, I found them to be credible. Indeed, the Defence did not challenge their testimonies in any significant way. The net effect of the Complainant’s disclosures to the four witnesses was that the Accused had: (i) followed her into the room when she went to retrieve the lotion, (ii) suggested that the massage be conducted on the floor of the bedroom, and (iii) during the massage, touched and exposed her vagina by moving her underwear aside.

86     I found no merit in the Defence’s contention that the evidence of the four witnesses lacked probative value.[\[note: 121\]](#Ftn_121) Ultimately, when the above disclosures were pieced together, it was clear that the Complainant had relayed to her friends and partner, a consistent account of what the Accused had done to her. In this regard, their evidence was probative and buttressed her evidence that she was in no doubt about what the Accused had done to her. Three of these witnesses also clearly testified to the Complainant’s state of distress. I accepted their evidence and found that the Complainant’s palpable distress in the aftermath of the incident, served to corroborate – in the liberal if not in the strict _Baskerville sense_ – her account that she had been molested by the Accused.

#### The Complainant confronted the Accused with the allegations

87     Quite apart from the aforementioned disclosures, the evidence also showed that the Complainant had in fact confronted the Accused about his actions several hours after the incident. In Exhibit P6 (which comprised a series of text messages between 10.19 p.m. on 27 November 2018 and 12.08 a.m. on 28 November 2018; _supra_ at \[23\]), the Complainant asked the Accused why he had performed the massage on her, and why it had not been recorded if it was part of the treatment. She also informed the Accused that she _“felt kinda violated”_ and was _“very uncomfortable when \[he was\] doing the massage on \[her\] particularly on \[her\] private areas”_.[\[note: 122\]](#Ftn_122) She recounted the Accused pushing her underwear aside and exposing her vagina during the massage without her consent and asked why he did not seek her permission prior to exposing her _“privates”_. The Complainant also pointedly asked the Accused why his fingers were touching her vagina when he was massaging up her thighs. She also informed him that his use of his mobile phone while her body was exposed, made her feel uncomfortable. The Complainant explained that she had not mentioned her discomfort earlier as she thought she was overthinking it, but subsequently decided to broach it directly with the Accused as she was _“deeply disturbed”_ by his actions.

88     All considered, I found that the Complainant’s messages to the Accused reflected a consistent account of her complaint that he had touched her vagina while massaging her thighs and exposed her vagina by moving her underwear aside without her consent. This further bolstered her credibility.

#### There was no undue delay in reporting

89     Finally, I address the Defence’s twin contention that – (i) the Complainant’s late reporting of the incident after speaking to her friends and partner, pointed to her being unsure of whether she was molested; and (ii) the Complainant’s acceptance of the Accused’s apology via text message (in Exhibit P6) showed that the subsequent police report was lodged under the influence of her friends and partner. [\[note: 123\]](#Ftn_123) I do not agree and make several observations.

90     First, there is no general rule requiring victims of sexual abuse to report the offences immediately or in a timely fashion to either the police or anyone else. Instead, it is incumbent upon the Court to assess the explanations provided so as to determine the impact of a failure to report an offence promptly, if any, on the complainant’s credibility: _Public Prosecutor v Mohd Ariffan bin Mohd Hassan_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 2 SLR 490</span> at \[62\], \[67\] and \[68\].

91     In the present case, I did not find any undue delay in the lodging of the police report.[\[note: 124\]](#Ftn_124) The Complainant testified that she had arrived at the police station on 28 November 2018 (the day after the incident) and had to wait till the early hours of 29 November 2018 to lodge the report.[^125] Further, the material substance of the Complainant’s allegations, as canvassed above, (_viz._ the touching of her vagina and moving of her underwear to expose her vagina) had surfaced well in advance of her lodging the report, in the course of her interactions with various parties; both when she confided in Ms B, Ms V, Ms H and Ms N about the incident and when she confronted the Accused about his actions. There was certainly _no_ undue delay on her part that raised any alarm in my mind regarding the veracity of her allegations.

92     Second, there was no doubt in my mind that the Complainant made the report of her own volition and not on account of any pressure or persuasion from her friends and partner. In the course of her evidence, the Complainant testified that: [\[note: 126\]](#Ftn_126)

> 
| 

\[W\]hile I was at work, I was thinking that I couldn’t let him get away with this, so I told \[Ms N\] that I needed to report him to the police. So after my work, I asked \[Ms N\] to accompany me to the police station.

 |

  
  

93     Thus, while the three women may have advised the Complainant to lodge a police report after hearing her recount the incident, it was clear that ultimately, the Complainant’s motivation in lodging the report stemmed solely from her realization and desire to see the Accused held accountable for his actions.

94     Third, I did not find the Complainant’s purported acceptance of the Accused’s apology at 12.01 a.m. on 28 November 2018, to detract from her subsequent decision to lodge a police report. The Complainant’s testimony showed that despite the Accused’s apology, the incident continued to operate on her mind while she was at work later that day. It was reasonable to surmise that as the Complainant continued to digest and process the incident whilst at work, she remained troubled by the incident (despite the Accused’s explanations and apology) and thus resolved to lodge the police report after work.

### The Complainant had No Motive to Frame the Accused

95     I round off my assessment of the Complainant’s evidence by examining if she would have any motive to lie about what transpired with the Accused. The law requires that the Defence adduce sufficient evidence of motive; one that raises a reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case, _before_ the burden shifts to the Prosecution to prove that there was no such motive: _Goh Han Heng v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 4 SLR(R) 374</span> at \[33\] and _Public Prosecutor v Roger Yue Jr_ at \[49\].

96     In the present case, the Defence rightly accepted that the Complainant had no reason to falsely implicate the Accused.[\[note: 127\]](#Ftn_127) I agree. By all accounts, the facts showed that prior to the commission of the offence on 27 November 2018, the Complainant and the Accused were on good terms and shared a cordial relationship. The Complainant had in fact, agreed to be an ambassador for Clinic. Pursuant to this collaboration, the Complainant would post videos of her treatments with the Accused on social media, and in return for every successful referral, would receive a stipulated commission and two complimentary sessions of bone realignment therapy and deep tissue massage. The arrangement was mutually beneficial, a fact the Accused accepted.[^128] There was thus clearly no reason – even on the Defence’s case – for the Complainant to falsely implicate the Accused.

97     Moreover, there was no evidence that the Complainant had wanted to rescind from her agreement to serve as the Clinic’s ambassador prior to the commission of the offence. That she was plainly interested in continuing as an ambassador, was clear from the fact that she set aside time on 27 November 2018 to assist the Accused with a trial video shoot of publicity materials.

98     Further, as the Prosecution rightly highlighted, it was inherently unbelievable that the Complainant would not only concoct false allegations against the Accused but thereafter go to great lengths to pursue the falsehood; lying to her friends and partner, the police and to the Court.[\[note: 129\]](#Ftn_129) All things considered, I found that the Complainant had no reason to falsely implicate the Accused. The evidence suggested that she spoke the truth and would have continued to serve as the Clinic’s ambassador but for what the Accused did to her on 27 November 2018.

### Conclusion on the Complainant’s Evidence

99     The Complainant’s evidence, which was textured and rich in detail, showed the intensity of her experience. In light of the preceding analysis, my observation of the Complainant in Court and the ensuing assessment of the Defence case below, I was of the view that the Complainant was an inherently credible witness who provided her evidence with clarity and without hesitation or embellishment. She was an’ unusually convincing’ witness and I accepted her evidence of what transpired during the massage.

## The Complainant’s Evidence was Corroborated by the Accused’s Police Statement

100    The various admissions in the Accused’s police statements (Exhibit P10 _coupled_ with Exhibit P11) fortified my finding that the Complainant’s allegations were true_._

### The Statements were Given Voluntarily

101    Both statements were admitted into evidence after I had determined that they had been given voluntarily. I pause here to explain my finding.

#### The law on ancillary hearings

102    The law on the admissibility of police statements was undisputed in the present case. The fundamental principle is that a statement must have been given voluntarily to the police by the accused before it may be admitted in trial. This principle is codified in s 258(3) of Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (2020 Rev Ed) (“CPC”), the material parts of which read as follows:

> The court shall refuse to admit the statement of an accused or allow it to be used in the manner referred to in subsection (1) if the making of the statement appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise having reference to the charge against the accused, proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient, in the opinion of the court, to give the accused grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making the statement he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him.

> _Explanation 1._ – If a statement is obtained from an accused by a person in authority who had acted in such a manner that his acts tend to sap and have in fact sapped the free will of the maker of the statement, and the court is of the opinion that such acts gave the accused grounds which would appear to the accused reasonable for supposing that by making the statement, he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him, such acts will amount to a threat, an inducement or a promise, as the case may be, which will render the statement inadmissible.

> _Explanation 2._ – If a statement is otherwise admissible, it will not be rendered inadmissible merely because it was made in any of the following circumstances:

>> \[…\]

>> (e) where the recording officer or the interpreter of an accused’s statement recorded under section 22 or 23 did not fully comply with that section;

>> \[…\]

103    The Prosecution bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the statements it seeks to admit were made voluntarily. In _Chai Chen Wei Kelvin v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 619</span>, the Court of Appeal explained the test of voluntariness in the following terms at \[53\]:

> 
| 

The test of voluntariness is applied in a manner which is partly objective and partly subjective. The objective limb is satisfied if there is a threat, inducement or promise, and the subjective limb when the threat, inducement or promise operates on the mind of the particular accused through hope of escape of fear or punishment connected with the charge.

 |

  
  

104    Although the main text of s 258(3) of the CPC mentions only “threat, inducement or promise”, it is well accepted that other forms of oppressive conduct tending to or in fact sapping the will of the accused, may also negate the voluntariness of a statement. In _Tey Tsun Hang v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 1189</span>, the High Court explained at \[88\] that, under the present version of the CPC, oppression is rationalized within the framework of threat, inducements or promise, since Explanation 1 to s 258(3) states that if “a person in authority who had acted in such a manner that his acts tend to sap and have in fact sapped the free will of the maker of the statement … such acts _will_ amount to a threat, inducement or promise” \[emphasis in original\]. This stands in contrast with the former approach where oppression was a distinct ground for a finding of involuntariness (_Tey Tsun Hang_ at \[88\]). Despite this conceptual shift, however, the substantive law on oppression remains the same: “the litmus test for oppression is whether the investigation was, by its nature, duration or other attendant circumstances, such as to affect the accused’s mind and will such that he speaks when he otherwise would have remained silent” (_Tey Tsun Hang_ at \[113\]). The same standard applies even where the allegation is not that the accused would have remained silent, but that he would have given a different version of the statement, had he not been oppressed.

105    I now turn to explain my decision in respect of the two statements, dealing with each, in turn.

#### Exhibit P10 – the long statement

106    The Accused’s long statement was recorded by IO Tan Yen Theng Jane (“IO Jane”) on 3 December 2018 between 10.50 a.m. and 12.45 p.m. in an interview room at the Police Cantonment Complex (“PCC”). It was recorded in the English language and contained answers to 15 questions. It concluded with a paragraph which stated that the statement had been read over and understood by the Accused who affirmed it to be true and correct. This was followed by the Accused’s signature.

##### (1)   The parties’ positions

107    The Accused raised two main arguments as to why his long statement was not admissible:

> a.     First, he contended that the statement had been given as a result of threat, inducement and promise (“TIP”). He argued that the initial typewritten long statement _without_ handwritten amendments, had been provided voluntarily to IO Jane. Once this statement had been printed however, IO Jane left the interview room and Senior Station Inspector Thanabalan Kothandapani (“SSI Thanabalan”) entered and levied several threats, inducements and promises over the span of an hour. The thrust of the Accused’s main allegations of TIP were as follows:

>> i.       SSI Thanabalan snatched the Accused’s mobile phone away, handed it to someone outside the interview room and proceeded to scold the Accused (“the First Allegation”);[\[note: 130\]](#Ftn_130)

>> ii.       SSI Thanabalan threatened to lock the Accused up for 48 hours and _“look into”_ two additional offences (“the Second Allegation”);[\[note: 131\]](#Ftn_131)

>> iii.       SSI Thanabalan promised to _“compound”_ the matter by persuading the Complainant to accept the offer (“the Third Allegation”); [\[note: 132\]](#Ftn_132)

>> iv.       SSI Thanabalan had a _“soft spot for NS police boys”_ and promised to persuade the Complainant to accept the Accused’s apology (“the Fourth Allegation”);[\[note: 133\]](#Ftn_133)

>> v.       The Accused decided to admit to the offence when SSI Thanabalan reiterated his threat to detain he Accused for 48 hours and _“dig more into \[his\] 2 other offences_;[\[note: 134\]](#Ftn_134) and

>> vi.       IO Jane re-entered, asked the Accused if he was ready to confess and made the handwritten cancellations and amendments to A12 and A14 of the statement, herself _”_ (“the Fifth Allegation”).[\[note: 135\]](#Ftn_135)

> b.     Second, the Accused alleged that there had been several procedural breaches during the statement-taking process. It was not clear if he meant that these breaches in themselves negated the admissibility of the statement, or that they, coupled with the threatening acts of the police, led to the recording of an untrue and inaccurate account in the statement.

108    The Prosecution’s case was that the long statement had been given voluntarily and was procedurally proper.[\[note: 136\]](#Ftn_136) Specifically, it asserted that SSI Thanabalan had only entered the interview room for a few minutes _prior_ to statement recording to escort the Accused as IO Jane needed to use the toilet. When IO Jane subsequently returned to the interview room, SSI Thanabalan left and the long statement was recorded in a question and answer format. Whilst reading the printed typewritten statement, the Accused directed IO Jane to make several handwritten amendments. After the final amendment was made, the Accused confirmed that he did not wish to make further changes. He then appended the final signature on the statement affirming the contents to be true and correct.

##### (2)   The Court’s decision

109    In my assessment, the Accused’s account of what had occurred during the recording of his long statement, was not credible. I thus found that there had been no threat, inducement or promise in relation to the recording of Exhibit P10. I came to this view for the following reasons.

110    First, I accepted that there was a reasonable and entirely innocuous explanation for SSI Thanabalan’s presence in the interview room. IO Jane had sought SSI Thanabalan’s assistance in minding the Accused as she needed to use the toilet and he was the only person in the office at the material time. She explained that she had not wanted to leave the Accused unattended in the interview room as, (i) there had been previous instances of self-harm when witnesses had been left alone, (ii) he may have had a request (for water or for use of the toilet) that needed addressing in her absence, and (iii) there was a chance that her superior would see the Accused alone and question her.[\[note: 137\]](#Ftn_137) These were cogent reasons. I observed that SSI Thanabalan himself testified that he had, on occasion, even engaged the assistance of colleagues from other investigations units to ensure that a witness was not left unattended.[^138]

111    I also accepted IO Jane’s evidence that SSI Thanabalan’s only interaction with the Accused had occurred _prior_ to the recording of Exhibit P10, and not _after_ the statement had been recorded and printed, as alleged by the Defence. This was corroborated by SSI Thanabalan himself, whom I assessed to be a credible witness who provided his evidence clearly, without embellishment.

112    Second, I disbelieved the First Allegation (_supra_ at \[107a.i\]), noting that there was a glaring inconsistency in the Defence’s case as to _who_ had taken the Accused’s phone from him. IO Jane testified that she had taken the Accused’s mobile phone from him with his consent to check if it contained any photographs or videos of the victim that she had not consented to.[\[note: 139\]](#Ftn_139) It was apparent, from Counsel’s cross-examination of IO Jane, that the Defence _accepted_ that _she_ had taken the mobile phone (albeit for an _“ulterior motive”_) prior to leaving the interview room and had obtained the password from the Accused to unlock the phone.[^140] The Defence’s subsequent claim that it was SSI Thanabalan who had snatched the Accused’s mobile phone from him and handed it to someone outside the interview room was _never_ put to IO Jane and stood in stark contrast to the case it had advanced when she was testifying.

113    I also found no reason to disbelieve SSI Thanabalan’s evidence that he was occupied on his own mobile phone and did not say anything else to the Accused apart from introducing himself after entering the interview room. I was mindful that SSI Thanabalan did not know the Accused, was unaware of what he was being investigated for and had no vested interest in the case.[\[note: 141\]](#Ftn_141)

114    In any event, based on the Accused’s own evidence, the alleged scolding dispensed by SSI Thanabalan (_viz. “read this bullshit”, “as a guy and the (sic) girl in a room with a closed door don’t tell me you did not commit that act”, “do not act stupid with me. You know that your statement was about outrage of modesty”_)[\[note: 142\]](#Ftn_142) did not have any bearing on his purported acquiescence to the subsequent amendments to Exhibit P10 as he steadfastly maintained his innocence even after the alleged confrontation.[^143]

115    Third, I found the cogency of the Second Allegation (_supra_ at \[107a.ii\]) to be severely undermined by the inherent implausibility of the contention. It would be recalled that the Accused had alleged that SSI Thanabalan had threatened to lock him up for 48 hours to investigate two _“additional offences”_, _viz._ for recording a video that could be used as _“pornography”_ and for providing a home massage service without a licence.[\[note: 144\]](#Ftn_144)

116    The Accused’s claim that he genuinely believed that the videos could be construed as _“soft pornography”_, was incredulous given: (i) that they neither contained any sexual acts nor revealed any private parts;[\[note: 145\]](#Ftn_145) and (ii) his inability to explain why he had proceeded with the video recording if this were indeed true.[^146]

117    The Accused’s other assertion that SSI Thanabalan had told him that the videos were pornography because certain parts showed the Complainant’s ‘glutes’ and hamstrings, was equally unbelievable since SSI Thanabalan had never viewed _any_ of the impugned videos and would not therefore have known what was depicted therein – a fact that the Accused accepted under cross-examination.[\[note: 147\]](#Ftn_147) Put simply, it was clear that SSI Thanabalan would not have possessed the very information that formed the substance of the alleged threat.

118    Further, the Accused’s subsequent claim that he had admitted to the amendments proposed by IO Jane after SSI Thanabalan had reiterated his threat to detain him for 48 hours, since he could not afford to be locked-up as he had bills to pay and needed to care for his mother (_supra_ at \[107a.v\]), was similarly illogical as a confession would only have increased the likelihood of the Accused being detained; the very outcome he was purportedly desperate to avoid. All considered, the Second Allegation was clearly a fabrication.

119    I found Third Allegation (_supra_ at \[107a.iii\]) to be similarly bereft of credibility. If the case could have been closed by the Accused simply offering the Complainant money, there would have been no incentive for him confess to the offence (the very outcome which SSI Thanabalan was allegedly attempting to manufacture). In any event, I noted the Accused’s own evidence that he rejected this alleged offer of composition.[\[note: 148\]](#Ftn_148)

120    The Fourth Allegation (_supra_ at \[107a.iv\]), apart from running counter to the evidence of SSI Thanabalan, also did not aid the Defence since the Accused purportedly rejected the offer.

121    For the foregoing reasons, I did not find the Accused’s account of his interactions with SSI Thanabalan to be credible. It was clear to me that there was no threat, inducement or promise emanating from SSI Thanabalan.

122    Having dismissed the contentions against SSI Thanabalan, I turn to examine whether there is any merit in the Accused’s assertion that IO Jane had made the handwritten cancellations and amendments at A12 and A14 of the statement, herself (_supra_ at \[107a.vi\]). To this end, I was acutely aware that salient parts of the Accused’s evidence had only arisen during his testimony. I highlight two of the more material claims that were not put to IO Jane when she was on the stand:

> a.     IO Jane asking the Accused if he was _“ready to confess”_;[\[note: 149\]](#Ftn_149) and

> b.     The Accused telling IO Jane that he was not sexually attracted to women because he was _“actually into guys”_ and her reply, _“that doesn’t mean gays do not have any temptation”._[\[note: 150\]](#Ftn_150)

123    The belatedness of the assertions surrounding the amendments to A12 and A14 served to cast significant doubt over the cogency of the Accused’s account of the statement recording process, which had already been significantly undermined by the preceding analysis at \[110\] to \[120\]. For reasons discussed at \[180\] below, I also rejected the Accused’s assertion as to his homosexual inclinations (notwithstanding Mr J’s testimony), finding it to be nothing more than a desperate attempt to obfuscate the truth.

124    All in all, I found IO Jane and SSI Thanabalan to be credible witnesses whose evidence was coherent, credible and logical. Any inconsistencies in IO Jane’s evidence[\[note: 151\]](#Ftn_151) were not material and wholly understandable given the passage of time. I had no hesitation accepting her evidence that she made the amendments seen in Exhibit P10, at the Accused’s behest after he had _“thought about it for some time.”_[^152] In this regard, I was especially mindful that it would have been illogical for IO Jane to have allowed the Accused’s exculpatory answers in other parts of the statement[^153] to remain if she had truly been intent on extracting a confession from him. For completeness, I would add that I also did not find the Prosecution’s case to be hampered by IO Jane’s inability to proffer a reason for the Accused’s decision to make the amendments, since she could not be expected to know what he was thinking at the time.[^154]

125    Ultimately, having considered the evidence in totality, I was satisfied that the Fifth Allegation was also patently fallacious.

126    The Accused’s conduct after leaving PCC, further fortified my finding that nothing untoward had occurred during the recording of Exhibit P10. Despite purportedly regretting the amendments made to the statement and realizing that he had _“made a stupid mistake”_,[\[note: 155\]](#Ftn_155) the Accused did not make a police report or lodge a complaint with the Singapore Police Force. He also did not engage a lawyer despite his cousin, Mr J, advising him to do so. This failure, despite knowing that IO Jane and SSI Thanabalan had acted improperly,[^156] undermined the veracity of the Accused’s assertion at trial and in Exhibit AH - D4[^157] that he had been forced to admit to something he had not done (the Accused’s subsequent expression of remorse in Exhibit P11 recorded six months later, and discussed at \[146\] below, further buttressed this finding). In my judgment, the Accused’s conduct after leaving PCC was inconsistent with the abuse and indignity he had allegedly suffered at the hands of IO Jane and SSI Thanabalan.

127    Thus, in the final analysis, I saw no reason to doubt that IO Jane had indeed recorded Exhibit P10 faithfully and truthfully. I accepted that Exhibit P10 was given voluntarily without any threat, inducement or promise and that it contained the account that the Accused had told IO Jane when his statement was recorded, whether or not he still wished to maintain the same version in Court.

##### (3)   There were no procedural irregularities in the recording of Exhibit P10 that would serve as a bar to admissibility

128    The Defence had intimated during IO Jane’s cross-examination, that the recording of Exhibit P10 was procedurally irregular as there was:

> a.     no explicit reference to the offence being investigated;

> b.     a failure to administer a warning against self-incrimination; and

> c.     no statement to the effect that Exhibit P10 had been recorded without any threat, inducement or promise.

129    I was of the view that there was no material irregularity in respect of Exhibit P10. Foremost, there is no statutory procedural obligation under s 22 of the CPC for the recorder to reference the charge or state that there was no threat, inducement or promise. Second, not every procedural breach, even if of a requirement expressly stated in s 22 of the CPC, would render a statement inadmissible if it is otherwise admissible. Explanation 2 to s 258(3) of the CPC states:

> If a statement is otherwise admissible, it will not be rendered inadmissible merely because it was made in any of the following circumstances:

>> \[…\]

>> (e) where the recording officer or the interpreter of an accused’s statement recorded under section 22 or 23 did not fully comply with that section. \[…\]

130    In any event, I found no procedural irregularities in the recording of Exhibit P10 that rendered it inadmissible. I thus concluded that the statement was admissible and admitted it into evidence. The issue of whether any alleged procedural irregularities ought to affect the _weight_ accorded to Exhibit P10, is a separate matter that I discuss at \[140\] to \[144\] below.

#### Exhibit P11 – the cautioned statement

131    The Accused’s signed cautioned statement was recorded by IO Jane on 26 June 2019 between 10.30 a.m. and 10.50 a.m. in an interview room at PCC. It was recorded in the English language and states (reproduced below in verbatim and uncorrected):

> I am sincerely remorseful of what I have done. Ever since the case, I have extremely careful when handling female client. As for now, I have many positive feedback on my company facebook. I plead for leniency. That is all.

132    The Accused’s signature appears several times on each page of the statement. He also signed below a paragraph which states that the statement was given without any threat, inducement or promise.[\[note: 158\]](#Ftn_158)

##### (1)   The parties’ positions

133    The Prosecution’s case was that Exhibit P11 was given voluntarily after IO Jane had informed the Accused that he was being charged with an offence of outrage of modesty, had explained the maximum penalty for the offence and read out the caution on page 3, in compliance with s 23(1) of the CPC.[\[note: 159\]](#Ftn_159) At the Accused’s behest, IO Jane then wrote the words reflected on page 4 of the statement (reproduced at \[131\] above). After the statement was read to the Accused, he was invited to make amendments. He declined to do so and proceeded to append his signature on pages 5 and 6 of the statement.[^160]

134    The Defence challenged the voluntariness of Exhibit P11 on the basis that the Accused had maintained his innocence until IO Jane had threatened him with the maximum prescribed punishment of two years’ imprisonment with caning if he continued to _“contradict”_ his long statement.[\[note: 161\]](#Ftn_161) As the Accused was anxious and realized he had no means of proving his innocence, he agreed to IO Jane’s suggestion of expressing remorse.[^162] IO Jane then wrote the words –_“I am sincerely remorseful of what I have done”_. Thereafter, the Accused informed IO Jane that he had been very careful with his clients since starting the business and had received positive feedback _“from ladies of all ages”_ on his Facebook account. IO Jane wrote this down in accordance with the Accused’s instructions.[^163] To be clear, the Defence did not challenge the voluntariness of the latter assertions which also appear in Exhibit P11.

##### (2)   The Court’s decision

135    In assessing the veracity of the Accused’s claims, three points bear highlighting. First, the Accused’s account that he had agreed to express remorse so as not to incur the maximum prescribed punishment by contradicting Exhibit P10, was as illogical as it was incredulous since the Accused knew he was being charged for outrage of modesty and an admission of guilt (in any form) would only have increased the likelihood of him being convicted and sentenced to imprisonment and caning; the very outcome he was ostensibly anxious to avoid.

136    Second, further undermining the Accused’s assertion, was the fact that he took no steps whatsoever, upon his release on bail that same evening, to lodge a police report or raise a complaint with the authorities or the lawyer that he subsequently engaged that same day.[\[note: 164\]](#Ftn_164)

137    Third, I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that IO Jane’s willingness to record other aspects of what the Accused had wanted to say in Exhibit P11, coupled with his ability to tell her that he had received positive feedback and was extremely careful in handling female clients (which showed presence of mind), was incongruent with his claim that he had meekly resigned himself to agreeing to all her suggestions without any control over the contents of his statement.[\[note: 165\]](#Ftn_165)

138    For completeness, I would also add that any inconsistencies in IO Jane’s testimony, pertaining to when her male colleague had entered and left the interview room, were minor and ultimately immaterial since the Accused had not alleged that any threat, inducement or promise had emanated from this individual whose sole task was to assist with the exchange of the Accused’s temporary pass and his subsequent arrest.[\[note: 166\]](#Ftn_166)

139    For the foregoing reasons, I disbelieved the Accused’s account of how the cautioned statement had been recorded and held that it had been given voluntarily. Exhibit P11 was thus admitted into evidence.

### There Were No Procedural Irregularities in the Recording of Exhibit P10 that Would Affect its Weight

140    Quite apart from its submissions on admissibility, the Defence also cited several purported procedural irregularities in the recording of Exhibit P10, in support of its contention that no weight should be placed on the statement. I deal with the grounds, which can be broadly classified into two bases, _in seriatim_.

141    First, the Defence submitted that no weight should be placed on Exhibit P10 as the Accused was not informed of its _“true purpose”_, was unaware that he was being investigated for an offence of outrage of modesty and was not informed of the maximum punishment prescribed for the said offence. As a result of these irregularities, the Defence asserted that the Accused was confused about why he was being investigated as he believed he had sufficiently clarified the matter with the Complainant.[\[note: 167\]](#Ftn_167) I found no merit in the aforesaid contention and agreed with the Prosecution that the Accused knew full well, that he had been accused of molesting the Complainant and that his statement was being recorded for investigative purposes.[^168] This was patently evident from the following exchange gleaned from the Accused’s own evidence under cross-examination:[^169]

> 
| 

Q

 | 

So, at that point you knew that you were being investigated for Outrage of Modesty, correct?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, this will be at the start before the recording of this statement P10i, is that correct?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And other than knowing that you were being investigated for Outrage of Modesty you also knew who the Complainant in this case (sic)?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And aside from that you also knew the particulars of the offence, meaning the time, the date and the place that this alleged Outrage of Modesty occurred, is that correct?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, now, \[Accused\], you knew that this statement was part of the investigation process, right?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And in fact, your evidence is that IO Jane told you that the statement was for investigation purposes, agree?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |

  
  

142    Second, the Accused submitted that no weight should be placed on Exhibit P10 as it contained several spelling mistakes (for example, the Complainant’s name, ‘bone alignment’ is misspelt as ‘bond alignment’, and ‘vagina’ is misspelt as ‘vaginal’) and erroneously omitted the word ‘revealed’. The Defence asserted that these errors compromised the “credibility of Exhibit P10” as they showed that IO Jane was unprofessional and negligent when recording the statement.[\[note: 170\]](#Ftn_170) Having perused the errors cited by the Defence, I agreed with the Prosecution that the mistakes were minor in nature and ultimately inconsequential as they had no bearing on the Accused’s confession. Further, save for a bare assertion that the spelling errors or missing word compromised the credibility of Exhibit P10, the Defence failed to demonstrate how and why these minor errors ought to have a material effect on the weight accorded to the statement.

143    The Defence also alleged that IO Jane had _“mixed-up”_ some questions and answers.[\[note: 171\]](#Ftn_171) Though the Defence did not explain the conclusion it desired the Court to draw from the aforesaid allegation, it may be presumed that this ground was tied to the broad contention that IO Jane was unprofessional and negligent in her recording of Exhibit P10. I found no force in this submission as the allegation that IO Jane had mixed-up the questions and answers was neither supported by the evidence[^172] nor put to her when she was testifying.

144    All considered, I concluded (as I did, _supra_ at \[130\]) that there were no procedural irregularities in the recording of Exhibit P10. Further, any spelling errors were minor in nature and did not have a material effect on the _weight_ to be accorded to the statement.

### Full Weight was Ascribed to the Incriminatory Admissions in the Statements

145    Having admitted the Accused’s statements into evidence, I now turn to consider the appropriate weight to ascribe to their contents.

146    I begin with Exhibit P11 which contains an expression of remorse by the Accused, for _“what \[he\] had done”_. As the Accused knew, at the point of recording, that he was being charged for outraging the modesty of the Complainant, I regarded his expression of remorse as an admission of guilt for the offence and, in ascribing full weight to it, found that it corroborated the Complainant’s allegations of sexual assault.

147    Next, I consider the weight to be ascribed to Exhibit P10 which, unlike Exhibit P11, contains both a confession to, and denial of, the alleged offence.[\[note: 173\]](#Ftn_173) In such a situation, the Court must consider both the incriminatory and exculpatory portions of a statement to determine the truth of the matter, _“although it is usually the case that the incriminating parts \[are\] likely to be true whereas excuses would not carry the same weight”_ (_Chan Kin Choi v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1991\] 1 SLR(R) 111</span> at \[34\] and \[35\]).

148    Having considered parties submissions on this point,[\[note: 174\]](#Ftn_174) I accorded full weight to the incriminating portions of Exhibit P10, _viz._ the Accused’s admission that he had succumbed to temptation and had used his fingers to touch the side of the Complainant’s vagina, his admission that he had flicked the Complainant’s underwear to the side and exposed part of her vagina,[^175] and his expression of remorse for what he had done.[^176] This was premised on the following reasons:

> a.     I accepted IO Jane’s evidence that all requisite procedures were complied with in the recording of Exhibit P10; and

> b.     Evidence led during the ancillary hearing had established that the statement was given voluntarily without any threat, inducement or promise. Once the Accused’s evidence as to the circumstances surrounding the recording of the statement (which I considered to be untrue and baseless) was discounted, it was clear that he was under no compulsion to provide the said admissions.

149    In view of the preceding, I found the broad thrust of the Complainant’s allegations (that the Accused had touched her vagina during the massage and exposed her vagina by moving her underwear aside) corroborated by the admissions in the Accused’s police statements.

150    I stress however, that the admission in Exhibit P10 was just _one facet_ of the evidence that I relied on in determining the Accused’s guilt. Given the inherent contradiction in Exhibit P10, the statement would not, in and of itself, have been cogent evidence of his guilt. However, the admissions in Exhibit P10, when considered _alongside_ the Complainant’s compelling testimony, the Accused’s unbridled expression of remorse in Exhibit P11 (recorded six months later, when he knew he was being charged with an offence of molest), and the deficiencies in the Defence case (discussed below), led me to conclude that it was sufficiently safe to rely on the incriminating portions of Exhibit P10 as corroboration.

## Analysis of the Defence Case

151    I now turn to the Defence case which in essence, was one of bare denial. To recapitulate, the Accused testified that he had performed a routine deep tissue massage on the Complainant on 27 November 2018 and that nothing untoward had happened. The Accused asserted that any contact with the Complainant’s vagina would have occurred inadvertently when she flinched and squirmed as he massaged her adductors. He further claimed to have moved the Complainant’s underwear with her consent and in a manner that did not expose her vagina.

152    Mr A, who was in the living room of the Complainant’s apartment during the massage, was called to corroborate several aspects of the Defence case. In addition, ‘expert’ evidence was led from Ms Lim (a physiotherapist) and Ms Diyanah (the Accused’s client) to bolster the Defence’s case that a deep tissue massage is inherently painful in nature, and attest to the likelihood of inadvertent contact with the private parts of a client who is squirming in pain during a massage.

153    Having carefully reviewed the evidence, I neither believed the Accused’s claims nor placed any weight on the evidence of his key witness, Mr A. I also did not find the evidence of the other Defence witnesses to assist in the determination of the key issues before this Court. I set out my reasons below.

### There were Material Deficiencies in the Accused’s Evidence

154    A panoply of significant deficiencies in the Accused’s evidence on several material issues affected the veracity of his claims. I highlight several of the more salient areas below but pause to make two preliminary observations at the outset.

155    First, though certain aspects of Mr A’s evidence appeared to cohere with some of the Accused’s assertions, I did not (for reasons discussed at \[186\] to \[191\] below) deem it safe to place any weight on it.

156    Second, it would be apparent in the ensuing analysis, that several _material facets_ of the Defence case were never put to the Complainant, nor her evidence on these issues satisfactorily challenged. The rule in _Browne v Dunn_ stipulates that where a submission is going to be made about the evidence given by a witness which is of such a nature and of such importance that it ought fairly to have been put to the witness to give him the opportunity to meet that submission, counter it or explain himself, then if it has not been so put, the party concerned will not be allowed to make that submission.[\[note: 177\]](#Ftn_177) In evaluating any objection premised on the rule, the Court must consider the totality of the evidence in the case. While the rule does not require every point to be put to a witness, this would generally be required when the submission is at the very heart of the matter and a failure to do so would mean that the Court may consider the unchallenged testimony to be undisputed by the opposing party and thus accepted: _Public Prosecutor v Punithan a/l Genasan_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 98</span> at \[50\].

157    In the present case, Defence Counsel submitted that the _Browne v Dunn_ rule _“\[did\] not extend to the Defence vis-à-vis \[the Complainant\], as the Defence’s application to recall the \[Complainant\] was rejected”_ by the Court.[\[note: 178\]](#Ftn_178) With respect, this argument was ill-conceived and grossly mischaracterized the true nature of the Defence’s application at trial, which had _not_ been premised on recalling the Complainant on account of the Defence’s failure to challenge aspects of her evidence and/or put parts of its case to her. On the contrary, the Defence’s application to recall the Complainant was premised on the Prosecution’s purported failure to comply with its disclosure obligations and the _possibility_ that there were inconsistencies between the Complainant’s testimony and her police statement. As I assessed that the Prosecution was not in breach of its disclosure obligations, and in the absence of the Defence proffering any other reason, I found no basis to recall the Complainant and had thus disallowed the application - addressed at \[214\] to \[217\] below.[^179] Flowing from this, the Defence’s reliance on the Court’s rejection of its application to recall the Complainant to distance itself from the rule in _Browne v Dunn_ was entirely misplaced; a fact that Defence Counsel himself eventually conceded.[^180]

158    In my view, while the Defence had failed to challenge several aspects of the Complainant’s evidence, particularly that which pertained to the _nature_ of the massage rendered on 27 November 2018, it could not readily be said that the failure to put these questions to the Complainant resulted in any procedural unfairness to her in the sense that she had been deprived of an opportunity to explain her evidence which would (in all likelihood) have amounted to nothing more than a denial of the Defence’s propositions (_Punithan_ (\[63\] _supra_) at \[54\]).

159    Nonetheless, while I was slow to find that the Defence was precluded from relying on propositions that were not put to the Complainant (for instance, that she was screaming in pain), I did find that the failure to challenge the Complainant on multiple issues so central to the Defence case, cast grave doubt over the _veracity_ of these claims; especially since these amounted to material internal inconsistencies in the Defence case for which no explanation had been proffered, _despite_ the Court’s express invitation and entreaty to do so.[\[note: 181\]](#Ftn_181)

160    Against this backdrop, I turn to address the various lacunae in the Defence case.

161    First, on the issue of whether there was a prior agreement for the Complainant to receive a deep tissue massage on 27 November 2018, it was the Complainant’s evidence that the parties had only arranged to record a trial video of the Accused performing bone realignment on her on the day in question. She testified that she was thus _“confused”_ when, having completed the trial video, the Accused told her that he was going to give her a deep tissue massage.[\[note: 182\]](#Ftn_182) In contrast, the Accused claimed that there was a prior agreement between the parties, for him to perform both a deep tissue massage and bone realignment therapy on 27 November 2018.

162    I found the Accused’s shifting explanations for _why_ the deep tissue massage was performed on the Complainant, problematic. When the Complainant was cross-examined, it was the Defence’s case that the Accused had performed the deep tissue massage _“as part of the free massage sessions”_ he had promised her. When the Complainant highlighted that the complimentary sessions were not due as she had yet to refer any clients to the Clinic, the Defence asserted that the free deep tissue massage was for the work she had just done on the trial video.[\[note: 183\]](#Ftn_183) When the Accused subsequently testified however, he claimed to have performed the deep tissue massage on the Complainant _since he had time_ and so that she could explain to her followers what they could expect when they engaged his services.[^184] The difference in the Defence’s position was stark - in the former, the massage was purportedly performed as a reward for work _already_ done (i.e. the video trial), whereas in the latter, the massage was purportedly performed to assist the Complainant with work _to be_ done (i.e. informing her followers of what the massage entailed). When confronted with this discrepancy under cross-examination, the Accused pivoted yet again (without explanation), claiming that the massage was performed for _both_ reasons.[^185]

163    Second, there were inherent contradictions in the Defence case on when the Complainant first received a deep tissue massage. The Accused claimed that he had not performed a deep tissue massage on the Complainant prior to the date of the incident (27 November 2018). To this end, he testified that: (i) she had only booked a session of bone realignment therapy on 6 October 2018, and (ii) he had thus only performed bone realignment therapy during that session.[\[note: 186\]](#Ftn_186) Notably however, though it was the Complainant’s evidence that she had undergone both bone realignment therapy and a deep tissue massage during her first session at the Clinic on 6 October 2018[^187], this was not only unchallenged, it was in fact _expressly confirmed_ and accepted by the Defence.[^188] Quite apart from the aforesaid, I also observed that the Accused’s evidence was squarely contradicted by his own witness, Mr A, who testified that the Complainant had received both bone realignment therapy and a deep tissue massage on 6 October 2018.[^189]

164    Given the internal inconsistencies in the Defence case on this issue, I had no difficulty accepting the Complainant’s unchallenged and corroborated evidence that she had indeed received a deep tissue massage from the Accused on 6 October 2018. By extension therefore, the Complainant would have been well able to tell her followers what to expect when they engaged the Clinic’s services, without the need for an additional deep tissue massage on the day of the incident. This added yet another layer of doubt to the Accused’s version, further corroding his account.

165    The third incongruity in the Defence case, lay in the Accused’s claim that it was the Complainant who, for _“privacy reasons”_, chose to have the deep tissue massage performed on the floor of her room. The Accused claimed to have given the Complainant the option of choosing where to have the massage as he knew it would entail her undressing and thus wanted to respect her right to privacy.[\[note: 190\]](#Ftn_190) Curiously however, the Accused never told the Complainant that she would have to undress and remove both her top and shorts during the massage; a fact he accepted under cross-examination.[^191] It was therefore unbelievable that the Complainant would choose, of her own volition, to have the massage on the floor of her cramped bedroom for ‘privacy reasons’, when she did not know that she would be clad in only her underwear. Quite simply, at the outset, the Complainant would not have realized the need for privacy since she was completely unaware of the impending state of undress required of her. Furthermore, contrary to the Accused’s claims on this issue was the Complainant’s evidence that it was the Accused who had followed her into the bedroom (when she went to retrieve a bottle of lotion) and suggested that the massage be performed on the floor despite her informing him that the room was small.[^192] Again, her evidence in this regard was not challenged when she was on the stand.

166    The incredulity of the Accused’s submission coupled with the Complainant’s unchallenged testimony led me to disbelief the former’s claims and accept the latter’s evidence on this issue. For completeness, I would also add that the Accused’s professed interest in respecting his female clients’ privacy was itself questionable given that he had no qualms uploading videos of them in their underwear on social media or sending the Complainant videos of a female client in her underwear.[\[note: 193\]](#Ftn_193) I was also mindful that during the incident itself, the Accused did not hesitate to perform the Complainant’s massage without covering the unclad parts of her body with a towel to protect her modesty and maintain a modicum of decency and professionalism.

167    Fourth, a central plank of the Defence was that the Complainant was in pain and screaming so loudly during the deep tissue massage that she could be heard by Mr A in the living room. The Defence submitted that this proved that the Accused was truly performing a deep tissue massage. Ultimately however, the belatedness of this claim proved fatal. I explain.

168    Though the Accused’s version stood in stark juxtaposition against the Complainant’s unequivocal description of the massage as normal, soothing, relaxing with gentle strokes and without any downward pressure or pain,[\[note: 194\]](#Ftn_194) her account was not challenged. This was in spite of the Defence being fully alive to the Complainant’s assertion that the massage on 27 November 2018 was wholly different to that performed on her on 6 October 2018. This is apparent from the following exchange which arose during cross-examination:[^195]

> 
| 

A

 | 

\[W\]hen we went to the bedroom on November 27th … **it was a different kind of massage. It was lighter than the deep tissue massage.**

 |

 |

 |
|

 |

 |
|

 | 

**On November 27, yes, I didn’t feel any discomfort**.

 |
|

 |

 |
| 

A

 | 

**Yes, correct.**

 |
| 

(emphasis added)

 |

  
  

169    Further undermining the Accused’s evidence was the fact that Exhibit P10 makes no mention of the Complainant having screamed in pain during the massage. Exhibit P6 similarly contains nary a mention of the Accused’s assertion that the Complainant was screaming and writing in pain. In my view, the aforesaid omissions coupled with the Defence’s failure to challenge the Complainant on an issue so central to its case, rendered the Accused’s claim highly dubious.

170    A fifth issue, connected to how the massage was performed, arises when one considers the Defence’s case in relation to the sequence of the massage and the use of lotion during the incident. The Accused testified that he had applied lotion to the Complainant throughout the massage. He claimed to have begun massaging her calves, hamstrings and ‘glutes’ as she lay prone. Once this was done on both sides of her body, he turned to massage both sides of the Complainant’s ankles, quads, groin area and adductors as she lay supine. Thereafter, the Complainant returned to a prone position for the Accused to massage her unclothed lower back and neck. The massage ended with a massage of the Complainant’s chest muscles whilst she lay supine.

171    The Complainant gave a diametrically different version and testified that the massage began with the Accused massaging her ‘glutes’, was paused for her to remove her shorts, and resumed with a massage to her ‘glutes’ again and thereafter her inner thighs. After her ‘glutes’ and both inner thighs were massaged, the Complainant testified that the Accused began massaging her left shoulder. This was interrupted when the Accused stopped to use his mobile phone. It was at this juncture that the Complainant realized that the Accused was no longer massaging her with lotion.[\[note: 196\]](#Ftn_196) According to the Complainant, after using his mobile phone, the Accused asked her to turn. She complied and he massaged her left inner thigh and thereafter her lower abdomen with her vagina partially exposed. He then massaged her right inner thigh and thereafter her lower abdomen with her vagina once again partially exposed.

172    I observed that the Complainant’s testimony suggested that the massage on 27 November 2018 had been performed in a haphazard manner. This was consistent with the Complainant’s narration of the incident to Ms B via text message shortly after the incident, where she stated, _“it was really weird because the massage was not even, I didn’t (sic) know if he got distracted”_ and _“only 1 side of the back was done.”_[\[note: 197\]](#Ftn_197)

173    Once again, the Complainant’s evidence as to the _sequence_ of the massage and when the Accused had stopped using lotion, was unchallenged. This rendered the Accused’s subsequent testimony highly suspect, especially when juxtaposed against the Complainant’s consistent account of the incident.

174    Sixth, the Accused’s vehement assertion that he had sought and obtained the Complainant’s consent to move her underwear,[\[note: 198\]](#Ftn_198) was never put to the Complainant when she was giving evidence. I also accepted the Prosecution’s submission that the Accused’s explanation that he had moved the Complainant’s underwear as he did not want to dirty it with lotion was not only incongruous with his ability to use his mobile phone during the massage,[^199] but also inconsistent with the Complainant’s assertion that he was no longer massaging her with lotion when he moved her underwear aside.

175    More pertinently, a perusal of Exhibit P6 would reveal that the Accused had failed to correct the Complainant’s explicit assertion that he had pushed her underwear aside and exposed her vagina _“without asking for consent”_,[\[note: 200\]](#Ftn_200) despite being purportedly _“stumped”_[^201] by the said accusation levelled against him.

176    I was unconvinced by his explanation that he had not wanted to escalate matters by denying the allegation[\[note: 202\]](#Ftn_202) as it was evident from Exhibit P6, that he had no such reservations denying the Complainant’s other allegations that he had exposed her private parts or taken pictures with his mobile phone. His explanation was also patently incompatible with his own concession in the text message, where he acknowledged that he appeared to be _“making an excuse”_ for his actions.[^203] It was clear that while the Accused made excuses for the other allegations the Complainant had leveled against him, he failed to address the accusation that he had moved her underwear without her consent. This cast significant doubt on his evidence on this issue and led to the irresistible inference that he had not sought to correct the Complainant because he truly had not obtained her consent to move her underwear and expose her vagina.

177    Finally, if the Defence is to be believed, the Complainant and the Accused parted ways on 27 November 2018 on good terms. Though the Accused accepted that the Complainant had no reason to falsely implicate him, he proffered _no_ explanation for the subsequent drastic change in the Complainant’s disposition towards him. As stated above, it was inconceivable that the Complainant would conjure allegations of molest if nothing untoward had occurred during the massage. In the absence of any explanation to the contrary, I surmised that her palpable distress in the hours following the incident, could only be explained by the fact that she had been molested.

178    It was clear from the foregoing that the Defence case was riddled with deficiencies that remained unsatisfactorily unaccounted for and presented a significant if not insuperable obstacle to accepting the Accused’s claims as genuine. By extension, I also did not find the Accused’s evidence sufficient to cast any doubt on my finding that the Complainant’s evidence was ‘unusually convincing’.

### The Accused’s Lies about His Sexual Orientation were ‘Lucas Lies’

179    I also found that the Accused had, in the course of testifying, fabricated evidence about his sexual orientation to bolster his case.

180    The Accused’s purported sexual attraction to men first arose as an issue during the ancillary hearing[\[note: 204\]](#Ftn_204) when the Defence sought to assert that his sexual inclination was incongruent with his confession.[^205] In support of this assertion, the Accused’s cousin, Mr J, testified that he believed the former to be ‘gay’. I had however, rejected Mr J’s evidence for several reasons:

> a.     the Accused had never personally told his cousin that he was ‘gay’;[\[note: 206\]](#Ftn_206)

> b.     there was no firm basis for Mr J’s ostensive belief. Mr J did not know if the Accused had ever been in a relationship with a man.[\[note: 207\]](#Ftn_207) Instead, he contended that the Accused was gay because he had different interests; while Mr J was a footballer, the Accused was a cheerleader and interested in drama, both of which were _“a woman thing”_ in the former’s assessment.[^208] While Mr J also claimed that the Accused had invited him to look at men when they were out,[^209] there was no information as to the context in which this was said; and

> c.     given the admittedly close relationship between the parties[\[note: 210\]](#Ftn_210), I could not discount the strong possibility that Mr J’s evidence was tainted in favour of his cousin. The latter coupled with the inherently speculative nature of the assertions and the absence of any objective concrete evidence disclosing the Accused’s penchant for men, led me to regard Mr J’s evidence as highly tenuous and thus reject it.

181    Evidence subsequently led by the Prosecution in the main trial, fortified my finding. A series of text messages admitted as Exhibit P13, shows the Accused asking Ms G (then, his colleague) for advice on how to get to know a woman, known only as Afqiah, _“more personally”_. In the ensuing exchange that spanned several days, the Accused bemoans not knowing how to _“get closer”_ to Afiqah and ask for her number without _“being weird or awkward”_. He recalls trying to talk to Afiqah via Instagram but states that he does not know _“how to hit on her”_. He also states that he was tongue tied and afraid of rejection. In a subsequent series of messages dated 1 November 2018 (which was approximately three weeks before the incident involving the Complainant), the Accused expresses sadness at not being able to see Afiqah anymore and states that he does not know how to ask for a picture with her without feeling awkward. He later expresses excitement at having seen Afiqah in a dress and states, _“you know how I love woman in dress”_.[\[note: 211\]](#Ftn_211) In sum, on a plain reading, the messages clearly conveyed the Accused’s romantic interest in the said woman.

182    When confronted with these messages, the Accused entangled himself in a convoluted tale. Though accepting that he had been soliciting advice on how to _“hit”_ on Afiqah, he tried desperately to portray himself as a ‘gay’ man who had merely planned to make his ex-boyfriend jealous by befriending Afiqah, taking photographs with her and posting them on his social media.[\[note: 212\]](#Ftn_212) Thereafter, when confronted with the message in which he reveals his partiality for a woman in dress, the Accused bizarrely claimed that he was attracted to _“whoever was in dress”_ and explained that his ex-boyfriend used to don dresses.[^213]

183    Ultimately, the Accused’s professed homosexual disposition simply did not cohere with the objective evidence before the Court. In this regard, I also noted Ms J’s _unchallenged_ testimony that the Accused had previously told her about _“his ex-girlfriend from ITE”_.[\[note: 214\]](#Ftn_214) It was clear to me that the Accused was not homosexual in orientation and his assertion to the contrary, was an ill-conceived attempt to bolster his claims of innocence.

184    All considered, I found the Accused’s disavowal of his heterosexuality to be a _‘Lucas lie’_. The principle is drawn from the case of _Regina v Lucas (Ruth)_ <span class="citation">\[1981\] QB 720</span> at 724, which held that an accused’s lie might amount to corroboration if it is a deliberate statement related to a material issue, which is proven independently to be untrue and the motive for the lie is a realization of guilt and fear of the truth.

185    In my judgment, the Accused had proven himself to be an untruthful witness.

### It was Unsafe to Rely on Mr A’s Evidence

186    The Defence relied on the following facets of Mr A’s evidence as corroboration of its case:[\[note: 215\]](#Ftn_215)

> a.     the Complainant brought the lotion to the living room and elected to have the deep tissue massage in her bedroom for privacy reasons;

> b.     the Complainant was screaming in pain during the deep tissue massage;

> c.     the trio had lunch together and reminisced for 20 to 30 minutes post-massage; and

> d.     the Complainant gave the Accused a hug before he left.

187    In assessing the cogency of Mr A’s evidence and the weight accorded to it, I was mindful of the following. Foremost, Mr A and the Accused are good friends who are _“very close”_.[\[note: 216\]](#Ftn_216) Apart from socializing with one another regularly, they also work together. In fact, Mr A testified that he had asked the Accused for a job in July 2020 as he was unemployed, and the latter agreed.[^217] Pertinently, Mr A continues to be employed by the Accused and remains an employee of the Clinic to date.[^218] Thus, quite apart from their close friendship, it was apparent that Mr A continues to depend on the Accused for employment and a regular income. In contrast, Mr A and the Complainant are mere acquaintances.[^219]

188    The prevailing symbiotic nature of the relationship between the Accused and Mr A, means that the latter undoubtedly has an interest in the outcome of the present case. To this extent, he cannot be said to be a neutral or disinterested party and I was alive to the very real possibility that Mr A may have provided evidence favorable to the Accused to preserve his friendship and employment. It was thus incumbent on me to judiciously scrutinize his evidence before ascribing any weight to it.

189    A degree of circumspection was all the more warranted as the evidence disclosed that Mr A and the Accused had had ongoing discussions about the incident. These conversations spanned 2018 (when the incident occurred), 2019 (when investigations had already commened), 2020 (when the trial began) and even 2021 (when the trial was underway).[\[note: 220\]](#Ftn_220) Thus, collusion aside, it would have been remiss of me not to address my mind to the _possibility_ of innocent infection.

190    Second, there were certain aspects of Mr A’s evidence that proved tenuous and demonstrated partiality to the Accused. For example, while Mr A steadfastly maintained that he had heard the Complainant screaming in pain during the incident, he rather curiously was unable to recall if she had done so during the deep tissue massage on 6 October 2018.[\[note: 221\]](#Ftn_221) Equally peculiar was his inability to recall if the Complainant had hugged the Accused on 6 October 2018, but recollect with ostensible clarity, the Complainant hugging the Accused before he left the apartment on 27 November 2018.[^222] Despite being given several opportunities to account for the disparity in his recollection, no explanation was forthcoming.[^223] Mr A was quite simply unable to shed any light on why he could recall the events of 27 November 2018 with clarity but not those from the Complainant’s 6 October 2018 session a mere few weeks earlier, despite his evidence that nothing out of the ordinary had occurred on _either_ occasion. In my view, Mr A’s selective recollection was dubious and suggested that he had crafted his evidence to buttress the Accused’s account.

191    Ultimately, the aforementioned factors coalesced to cast a spectre of doubt over the veracity of Mr A’s evidence. I thus found it is unsafe to rely on his evidence as corroboration of the Accused’s various claims. I must stress that this finding was not premised solely on the fact that the Accused and Mr A are friends. Rather, it was a confluence of the factors canvassed above, that led me to this conclusion.

192    The consequence of my finding was that the Accused’s evidence remained uncorroborated, and his guilt fell to be determined by assessing his account against that of the Complainant’s.

### The Evidence of Ms Lim and Ms Diyanah Did Not Assist the Defence

193    I also saw nothing in the evidence of the remaining Defence witnesses that would assist the Accused.

194    First, neither Ms Lim nor Ms Diyanah were present during the massage performed on the Complainant on 27 November 2018. Thus, while they were able to shed some light on what would _ordinarily_ transpire during a deep tissue massage, they were not in any position to comment on either the nature of the _actual_ massage performed on the Complainant on the day in question, or the technique employed by the Accused during the massage. For this reason, their evidence was of little, if any, utility to the Defence.

195    Second, rather ironically, I found that Ms Lim’s and Ms Diyanah’s evidence in fact undermined the Defence in the following manner:

> a.     both witnesses testified that a deep tissue massage is painful and often results in the client screaming and writhing in pain as it entails the use of some degree of force.[\[note: 224\]](#Ftn_224) This stood in stark contrast to the Complainant’s (unchallenged) evidence that the massage rendered on her was _“smooth”_, painless and _“relaxing”_;[^225]

> b.     Ms Lim testified that she would take care to ensure that she does not expose her client’s private parts when she readjusts their underwear. She also testified that it was unacceptable to move a client’s underwear and expose their vagina without their consent.[\[note: 226\]](#Ftn_226) Ms Diyanah testified that the Accused would always seek her permission to _“push \[her\] underwear up a bit”_ prior to doing so.[^227] She also stated that the Accused had never exposed her genitalia before[^228] and would push her underwear upwards (as depicted in Exhibit D5(1) at timestamp 41:26) instead of to the side. Again, in contrast, the Complainant’s evidence was that the Accused had exposed her vagina by moving her underwear sideways, to the _middle_ of her vagina, without her consent; and

> c.     whereas Ms Diyanah testified that the Accused always massaged both sides of her upper back[\[note: 229\]](#Ftn_229), the Complainant gave evidence that only one side of her upper back was massaged.

196    The evidence of the Defence witnesses, when viewed alongside the Complainant’s evidence (which I accepted as true for reasons canvassed at \[62\] to \[99\]), revealed that the massage performed on 27 November 2018 was not genuinely a deep tissue massage and did not accord with the Accused’s usual practices, _viz._ he did not exert any pressure, he did not provide a complete massage, he exposed the Complainant’s vagina by pushing her underwear to the _middle_ of her vagina and he did so without seeking her consent.

197    Additionally, I found the evidence of the Defence witnesses to also undermine the Accused’s submission that any contact with the Complainant’s vagina was accidental. In this regard, I noted Ms Diyanah’s testimony that the Accused had never touched her vagina before, even accidentally, despite her squirming in pain.[\[note: 230\]](#Ftn_230) As for Ms Lim, while she initially accepted that it was possible to touch a female client’s vagina accidentally during a massage, she explained that it was _“not easy”_ and in fact _“quite difficult”_ to do so because the _“vagina is quite median”_ and _“hidden”_.[^231]

198    In the course of her testimony, Ms Lim was also referred to Exhibit P3 and specifically area ‘E’ (_supra_ at \[19\]), which the Complainant had indicated was the location where she had been touched by the Accused.[\[note: 232\]](#Ftn_232) Notably, when queried by Defence Counsel himself, Ms Lim testified that the likelihood of intruding into Area E was _“unlikely. Probably, close to zero”_.[^233] This further reinforced my view that the Accused’s _repeated_ touching of the Complainant’s vagina was intentional and anything but accidental.

199    In all, the Defence witnesses’ evidence was more detrimental than helpful for the Accused.

### There were No Material Investigative Lapses and No Basis for an Adverse Inference to be Drawn Against the Prosecution

200    The Defence sought to draw the Court’s attention to several alleged investigative lapses which it submitted had left a gap in the case.[\[note: 234\]](#Ftn_234) I found the overall submission to be untenable and address each ground _in seriatim._

201    First, the Defence submitted that an adverse inference ought to be drawn for the Prosecution’s failure to investigate, call and/or offer the Complainant’s housemate as a witness at trial.[\[note: 235\]](#Ftn_235) The assertion was unmeritorious for the following reasons:

> a.     the housemate’s presence in the apartment at the material time, was in fact rather fleeting. To this end, I noted that it was not in dispute (since it was unchallenged) that the housemate had in fact left the apartment sometime _“\[at\] the beginning”_ of the massage;[\[note: 236\]](#Ftn_236)

> b.     in any event, I accepted as satisfactory, IO Jane’s explanation that she had not considered the housemate a material witness as he was not present in the Complainant’s room during the deep tissue massage;[\[note: 237\]](#Ftn_237)

> c.     the aforesaid explanation was not unreasonable as IO Jane was unaware that the Defence would subsequently allege that the Complainant had been screaming in pain during the massage; since this was neither mentioned in Exhibit P6 (text messages between the Accused and the Complainant) nor Exhibit P10 (the Accused’s police statement) recorded several days after the incident;[\[note: 238\]](#Ftn_238) and

> d.     as the housemate had already left Singapore when IO Jane wanted to contact him,[\[note: 239\]](#Ftn_239) this was not a situation where the Prosecution had _intentionally_ excluded him from investigations or _“obscured”_ the Defence from contacting him (there was also no such request from the Defence at any point).[^240]

202    Second, the Defence contended that IO Jane’s failure to conduct a scene visit coupled with the Prosecution’s failure to adduce photographs or videos of the Complainant’s house had left a gap in the case as it could not be _“empirically determined”_ if the Accused’s portable massage bed would have been able to fit into the Complainant’s bedroom.[\[note: 241\]](#Ftn_241) This argument was similarly flawed since it was not in dispute that the massage had been performed on the floor of the Complainant’s room because the Accused’s massage bed could not fit. The parties also did not dispute that the Complainant’s room was small and cramped. Thus viewed, there was no ‘gap’ in the Prosecution’s case. Furthermore, as the Prosecution rightly highlighted, _“whether the portable massage bed could have actually fit into the \[Complainant’s\] bedroom is simply irrelevant. The more pertinent issue is why the deep tissue massage was carried out in the \[Complainant’s\] bedroom, \[and on this issue\] the accused was not able to provide a satisfactory explanation.”_[^242]

203    Ultimately, I found nothing overly remiss in IO Jane’s assessment that photographs of the apartment and bedroom were unnecessary. She explained that she generally undertook scene visits for offences that had occurred outdoors, in order to secure the scene and ascertain the presence of any CCTV cameras in the vicinity.[\[note: 243\]](#Ftn_243) As the present offence took place indoors, in an environment that was not dynamic, I accepted IO Jane’s explanation that she saw no need to conduct a scene visit. In any event, I did not find the absence of photographs to have hampered the Defence’s case.

204    Finally, the Defence submitted that IO Jane’s failure to obtain correspondence between the Complainant, Mr A and the Accused was an investigative lapse as such evidence would have been critical to shedding light on whether the deep tissue massage was part of the video trial.[\[note: 244\]](#Ftn_244) I agreed with the Prosecution that any such correspondence would have been equally available to the Defence since the evidence sought could have been easily retrieved from either the Accused and/or Mr A and thereafter tendered in evidence – again, there was thus no ‘gap’ to speak of. I therefore also did not consider this to be an omission that hindered or prejudiced the Defence case.[^245]

### The Defence’s Application for the Complainant’s Statement and Recall of the Complainant and IO Jane

205    Before disposing of the Accused’s case, I turn to one last argument made by the Defence at the close of its case. This pertained to an application for disclosure of the Complainant’s statement and an application to recall both the Complainant and IO Jane for further cross-examination. I address the applications in turn.

#### The application for disclosure

206    The Defence sought disclosure of the Complainant’s police statement pursuant to the Prosecution’s common law disclosure obligations as set out in _Muhammad bin Kadar and another v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 3 SLR 1205</span> (“_Kadar_”), on the primary premise that there _may_ be inconsistencies between the statement and the Complainant’s testimony. The Prosecution asserted that it was not in breach of its _Kadar_ obligations.

207    Before assessing the merits of the application, it would be useful to canvass the scope of the Prosecution’s disclosure obligations. Foremost, as the Court of Appeal held in _Kadar_ (at \[113\]), the obligation only arises in respect of material that tends to undermine the Prosecution’s case or strengthen the Defence’s case. The Prosecution does not have to disclose material which is neutral or adverse to the accused.

208    What then is the appropriate procedural approach where the Defence claims, as it did in this case, that the Prosecution has certain material in its possession which should be disclosed as part of its _Kadar_ obligations, but the Prosecution asserts that the unused material in its possession has not fulfilled the necessary requirements? The procedure applicable in such scenario was distilled in _Lee Siew Boon Winston v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1184</span> (“_Winston Lee_”) at \[184\]:

> 
| 

(a)    When a trial or an appeal begins, there is a **presumption that the prosecution has complied with its** **_Kadar_** **obligation.** This would mean that the court presumes that all material which should be disclosed has been disclosed.

(b) This **presumption will only be displaced if the court has sufficient reason to doubt that the prosecution has complied with its** **_Kadar_** **obligation.** In this regard, **once the defence satisfies the court that there are reasonable grounds for belief that the prosecution has failed to comply with its** **_Kadar_** **obligation, the court will look to the prosecution to show that it has complied with its obligation.** The prosecution must then establish to the satisfaction of the court that it has fulfilled its _Kadar_ obligation since the court will no longer simply presume that there is compliance.

(c) At this point, the prosecutor in charge of the case should re-evaluate his or her position having regard to the contentions raised by the accused at trial \[…\] which has caused the presumption of compliance to be rebutted. It is at this point that the prosecution may inform the court that it is not required to give disclosure due to the operation of any ground under any law.

(d) Where the prosecution itself after re-evaluation has doubts whether to disclose, disclosure to the defence should be the usual course.

(e) If after re-evaluation, the prosecutor still resists disclosure, it can choose whatever method it wishes to satisfy the court that it has complied with its _Kadar_ obligation owed to the court. In cases such as this, where contents of the witness’ statement are in question, the prosecution can tender the statement to court without it being shown to the defence. The court will decide whether the objective test for disclosure as laid down in _Kadar I_ is satisfied \[…\]

(f) The court will examine the material and evidence tendered to the court by the prosecution to prove its compliance and also examine the parties’ positions carefully but not restrictively in deciding if disclosure should nevertheless be ordered. Generally, if the court finds difficulty in deciding whether disclosure should be ordered, it would lean towards ordering disclosure.

(g) If the court finds that disclosure is not required, the material is returned to the prosecution without the defence ever having looked at it.

(h) On the other hand, if the court finds that disclosure is required, it would make an order that the prosecution disclose the material to the defence. This would also mean that the prosecution would have been in breach of its _Kadar_ obligation.

(i) Finally, an order from the trial judge in relation to the procedure above is one which is not appealable under s 374(1) of the CPC as it lacks the element of finality.

(emphasis added)

209    Applying the principles set out in _Winston Lee_ to the present case, I was, for the following reasons, of the view that there were no reasonable grounds to believe that the Prosecution had failed to comply with its _Kadar_ obligations and thus displace the presumption that it had fully complied with its obligations:

> a.     foremost, the Defence’s submission that the Complainant _“may”_ have given an inconsistent version in her police statement, was mere conjecture;

> b.     second, the alleged consistency relied upon[\[note: 246\]](#Ftn_246) was not of a material nature as (i) it did not alter the thrust of the Complainant’s evidence that the Accused had used his mobile phone during the massage as she lay prone, (ii) the Defence could have cross-examined the Complainant on the alleged inconsistency but chose not to do so, and (iii) the Accused’s own evidence was that he had used his mobile phone during the massage; and

> c.     third, the remaining grounds put forth by the Defence,[\[note: 247\]](#Ftn_247) comprised of bare assertions that the Prosecution may _possibly_ be in breach of its _Kadar_ obligations. In the absence of anything more than mere speculation, there were no reasonable grounds for the Court to believe that the Prosecution had breached its disclosure obligations.

210    Since I did not find reasonable grounds for belief that the Prosecution had not complied with its _Kadar_ obligations, it was not necessary to proceed to the next step of the _Winston Lee_ framework.

211    In addition to the above, the Defence also sought disclosure of the Complainant’s statement pursuant to the Prosecution’s “additional disclosure obligations”[\[note: 248\]](#Ftn_248) arising from the Court of Appeal’s pronouncement in _Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 984</span> (“_Nabill_”) that the Prosecution was required to disclose to the Defence, statements furnished to the police by a material witness. A material witness was defined as a person who can be expected to confirm, or conversely, contradict an accused person’s defence in material respects (_Nabill_ at \[4\]). In _Roshdi bin Abdullah Altway v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGCA 103</span>, the Court of Appeal explained that the Prosecution’s additional disclosure obligations does not extend to statements of a material witness who is also a prosecution witness (at \[133\]).

212    In the present case, the Complainant was a material witness. However, I formed the view that the _Nabill_ disclosure obligations had not been triggered since the Complainant had already testified as a Prosecution witness. A key rationale for the additional disclosure obligations was thus not engaged. Quite apart from this, I found that the Defence had not provided the Court with a proper basis, let alone a compelling one, for the Complainant’s statement to be disclosed pursuant to _Nabill_.

213    For these reasons, I was disinclined to allow the Defence’s application for disclosure of the Complainant’s statement.

#### The application for recall

214    I now turn to the Defence’s application under s 283 of the CPC to recall the Complainant and IO Jane for cross-examination.[\[note: 249\]](#Ftn_249)

215    I found no basis to recall the Complainant since I had not found the Prosecution to be in breach of its _Kadar_ obligations and the Defence had not proffered any other reason for recalling her.

216    I similarly found no merit in the application to recall IO Jane on the premise that the Prosecution had breached its _Nabill_ obligations by disclosing Mr A’s statement late, thereby depriving the Defence of an opportunity to question IO Jane on why Mr A’s statement was only recorded in August 2020. I elaborate:

> a.     the Defence accepted that the disclosure of Mr A’s statement in 2021 did not prejudice or impede its decision/ability to interview him or call him as a witness;

> b.     I did not accept that the Defence was under the ‘false impression’ that Mr A’s statement was taken shortly after the incident. It was clear from Defence Counsel’s cross-examination of IO Jane, that the Defence was fully alive to the fact that Mr A’s statement was probably recorded sometime in 2020;[\[note: 250\]](#Ftn_250)

> c.     from a perusal of the notes of evidence, it was clear that the Defence’s cross-examination proceeded on the basis that Mr A’s statement was in fact recorded in 2020.[\[note: 251\]](#Ftn_251) It was thus clear that the Defence had _every opportunity_ to question IO Jane on why Mr A’s statement was only recorded in 2020, if it in fact desired to do so; and

> d.     ultimately, even if I accepted the Defence’s position, the issue of when Mr A’s statement was recorded would not assist the Court in its determination of the issues central to the charge and would therefore not be “essential to making a just decision in the case”.

217    For these reasons, I was disinclined to allow the Defence’s application to recall the witnesses.

## The Finding of Guilt

218    After careful consideration of the evidence put forth by the Prosecution and the Defence, I was satisfied that the Complainant’s account was ‘unusually convincing’ and, when taken together with the admissions of guilt in Exhibits P10 and P11, as well as the deficiencies in the Defence case, conclusively proved the Accused’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

219    I found that the Accused had not performed a legitimate deep tissue massage on 27 November 2018. Instead, he had acted deceptively and brazenly, molesting the Complainant under the guise of the massage he was performing, knowing full well that his actions were likely to outrage her modesty. I thus convicted him.

## Sentencing

220    The framework in _Kunasekaran s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 580</span> (“_Kunasekaran_”) guides sentencing for offences under s 354(1) of the Penal Code and invites the Court to adopt the following two-step sentencing band approach (at \[46\] – \[49\]):

> 
| 

(a) First, the court should identify under which band the offence in question falls within, having regard to the factors which relate to the manner and mode by which the _offence_ was committed as well as the harm caused to the victim (we shall refer to these as ‘offence-specific’ factors). Once the sentencing band, which defines the range of sentences which may _usually_ be imposed for a case with those offence-specific features, has been identified the court should then determine precisely where within that range the present offence falls in order to derive an ‘indicative starting point’, which reflects the intrinsic seriousness of the _offending act_.

(b) Secondly, the court should have regard to the aggravating and mitigating factors which _are personal to the offender_ to calibrate the appropriate sentence for that offender. These ‘offender-specific’ factors relate to the offender’s particular personal circumstances and, by definition, _cannot_ be the factors which have already been taken into account in the categorization of the offence. In exceptional circumstances, the court is entitled to move outside of the prescribed range for that band if, in its view, the case warrants such a departure.

 |

  
  

221    Referencing _GBR v Public Prosecutor_ \[2017\] SGC 296 (“_GBR”_), the following were identified as relevant offence-specific factors:[\[note: 252\]](#Ftn_252)

> 
| 

(i) The degree of sexual exploitation. This includes considerations of the **part** of the victim’s body the accused **touched**, **how** the accused **touched** the victim, and the **duration** of the outrage of modesty.

(ii) The circumstances of the offence. These include considerations of: (A) the presence of premeditation; (B) the **use of force** or violence; (C) the abuse of a position of trust; (D) the use of deception; (E) the **presence of other aggravating acts** accompanying the outrage of modesty; and (F) the **exploitation of a vulnerable victim**.

(iii) The **harm caused to the victim**, whether physical or psychological, which would usually be set out in a victim impact statement.

 |
| 

(emphasis added)

 |

  
  

222    The prescribed characteristics of each band were distilled at \[45\](b):

> 
| 

a) Band 1: This includes cases that do not present any, or at most one, of the offence-specific factors, and typically involves cases that involve a fleeting touch or no skin-to-skin contact, and no intrusion into the victim’s private parts.

b) Band 2: This includes cases where **two or more of the offence-specific factors** present themselves. The lower end of the band involves cases where the private parts of the victim are intruded, but there is no skin-to-skin contact. The higher end of the band involves cases where there is skin-to-skin contact with the victim’s private parts. It would also involve cases where there was the use of deception.

c) Band 3: This includes cases where numerous offence specific factors present themselves, especially factors such as the exploitation of a particularly vulnerable victim, a serious abuse of a position of trust, and/or the use of violence or force on the victim.

### The Prosecution’s Position

223    Applying the _Kunasekaran_ framework, the Prosecution submitted that a sentence of between 12 to 14 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane was appropriate.[\[note: 253\]](#Ftn_253) In support of its submission that the offence fell at the higher end of Band 2, the Prosecution highlighted three offence-specific factors _viz_, contact with and exposure of private parts, the abuse of trust and the use of deception. As there were no offence-specific mitigating factors, the Prosecution submitted that no downward calibration of the sentence was warranted.[^254]

### The Defence’s Position

224    The Defence agreed that the Kunasekaran framework applied. While there was consensus that the Accused’s offending fell within Band 2, the Defence contended that it lay at the middle to lowest end of Band 2, thus warranting a sentence of no more than 8 months’ imprisonment.[\[note: 255\]](#Ftn_255) In this regard, it was submitted that:

> a.     the sexual exploitation was of a short duration;[\[note: 256\]](#Ftn_256)

> b.     there was a limited abuse of a position of trust;[\[note: 257\]](#Ftn_257)

> c.     the Complainant was not young, neither was she in a vulnerable position;[\[note: 258\]](#Ftn_258)

> d.     the circumstances of the offence were not particularly serious: the offence was opportunistic, there was no premeditation and no force exerted;[\[note: 259\]](#Ftn_259) and

> e.     little harm was caused to the Complainant, and any trauma stemming from the incident was “nil or negligible at best”.[\[note: 260\]](#Ftn_260)

225    On the issue of caning, the Defence submitted that no caning should be imposed as the Accused’s conduct was “not of such gravity and egregiousness to attract the sentencing objectives of deterrence and retribution.”[\[note: 261\]](#Ftn_261)

226    In mitigation, the Defence also highlighted that the Accused was a first offender who was supporting his mother and siblings. It was submitted that a lengthy sentence would have a devastating effect on his dependents.[\[note: 262\]](#Ftn_262)

### The Appropriate Custodial Sentence

#### Offence-specific factors

227    In calibrating an appropriate sentence, I was guided by the framework in _Kunasekaran_, and began by considering the relevant offence-specific factors.

228    In my judgment, the degree of sexual exploitation was high since even on a _conservative_ assessment, the Accused had touched the Complainant’s vagina no less than 12 times during the massage. He also pushed her underwear aside and exposed her vagina twice. Though there was no skin-to-skin contact with the Complainant’s vagina, the multiple incursions to her private parts spanned several segments of the massage and could only be described as sustained and persistent.

229    Next, I considered the circumstances of the offence. Trust is a defining element in every masseur-client relationship. This intrinsic trust is expressed in the latitude given to a masseur to touch a client’s unclothed body in the course of a massage. In the present case, the Complainant placed her trust in the Accused by virtue of his trade (see \[29(c)\] of _GBR_); disrobing at his request and allowing herself to be massaged semi-undressed, expecting no doubt that the Accused would, as a professional therapist, perform the massage in a lawful manner with due regard for her modesty and without willfully intruding upon her private parts. It was clear to me that by his actions, the Accused had abused the trust reposed in him.

230    There was further aggravation accruing from the fact that the offending acts were perpetrated under the guise of the Accused performing a legitimate deep tissue massage on the Complainant. It was this very deception that (i) facilitated the offence; (ii) led the Complainant to question if the Accused’s contact with her vagina was innocuous and part of a genuine massage practice; and (iii) necessitated her clarifying her doubts with a friend in a similar field of practice.

231    Finally, I also had regard to the harm caused to the Complainant. A victim impact statement tendered by the Prosecution, disclosed the emotional aftermath of the offence on her. Detailing how the incident had _“tested \[her\] emotional limits”_, she shared that:[\[note: 263\]](#Ftn_263)

> a.     she saw a psychologist several times post-incident but had to stop due to the cost of the sessions;

> b.     she now requests for a female when consulting a doctor or engaging a masseur. To an extent, this has hampered her independence as she requires a friend to accompany her when a female practitioner is unavailable;

> c.     she drank excessively during the trial as having to act and work normally, was stressful. The stress also manifested in several bouts of abdominal ailments which resulted in hospitalizations in February and March 2021; and

> d.     she is triggered by people who look like the Accused.

232    It was clear that the Complainant had suffered and continues to experience a degree of emotional and psychological trauma as a consequence of the incident.

233    Based on the foregoing offence-specific factors, it was plain that the appropriate starting point could not be near the low to middle remit of Band 2 as suggested by the Defence. Furthermore, the Defence’s submission that a sentence of 8 months’ imprisonment was appropriate given the absence of several aggravating factors, such as premeditation and the use of force, was misplaced as the non-existence of an aggravating factor could not be construed as a mitigating factor which an offender should be given credit for.

234    After a holistic assessment of the factors at the first stage, I determined that this case fell squarely above the middle remit of Band 2 with a starting point of 12 months’ imprisonment.

#### Offender-specific factors

235    I then considered if there were any offender-specific factors that warranted further calibration of the indicative sentence.

236    First, the fact that the Accused was a first-offender was a neutral factor as it was not positive evidence of good character and was relevant only to the extent that I did not find it necessary to impose a heavier punishment in order to specifically deter him from reoffending: _Stansilas Fabian Kester v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 755</span> (_“Stansilas”_) at \[99\].

237    Next, I considered the fact that the Accused had claimed trial to be a neutral factor. While it was his right to do so, he was not entitled to any sentencing discount that he would otherwise have been entitled to had he pleaded guilty.[\[note: 264\]](#Ftn_264)

238    Finally, I did not consider the professed adverse personal consequences that would follow as a result of the Accused’s conviction and sentence, including hardship to his dependents, to be a relevant mitigating factor. Barring exceptional circumstances (which did not feature in the present case), such collateral consequences, whilst regrettable, were not relevant to sentencing. Quite simply, a person who breaches the criminal law must expect to face the consequences that follow under the law: _Stanslias_ at \[110\] – \[111\]; _M Raveendran v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 254</span> at \[13\], \[32\], \[38\] and \[47\].

#### The sentence imposed

239    Having undertaken a holistic assessment of the factors in the present case, I found no reason to disturb the indicative sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment. In addition, I also imposed 3 strokes of the cane to adequately reflect the need for deterrence and retribution that was clearly warranted on the facts. This also accorded with the practice that caning ought to be imposed where a victim’s private parts and sexual organs are intruded upon: _Public Prosecutor v Chow Yee Sze_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 1 SLR 481</span> at \[9\]; cited with approval in _GBR_ at \[31\] and _Kunasekaran_ at \[50\].

#### Precedent cases

240    I turn briefly, to address the precedents that were brought to my attention.

241    The Prosecution cited _Public Prosecutor v Willet Ong Tat Kee_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGMC 48</span> (“_Willet Ong_”)[^265] in which the offender, a massage therapist, had claimed trial to molesting the victim who had sought treatment for a chronic back pain on four occasions. On the first three occasions, the offender had pressed the victim’s nipples and pubic bone. On the fourth occasion, the offender had pressed the victim’s urethra and nipples. The offender was sentenced to 10 months’ imprisonment in respect of each of the first three acts of molestation. In respect of the fourth incident, he was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment. He could not be caned due to his age.

242    In my assessment, _Willet Ong_ discloses that minimally, a tariff of 12 months’ imprisonment extends to cases which feature the offence-specific factors of intrusion into the private parts of the victim, an abuse of trust and the use of deception. While there was skin-to-skin contact between the offender’s hand and the victim’s private parts in _Willet Ong_, this aggravating factor was counterbalanced in the present case by the Accused’s sustained and persistent contact with the Complainant’s vagina on no less than 12 instances during the massage. To this end, the degree of sexual exploitation in both cases was broadly similar. However, unlike the offender in _Willet Ong_, the Accused was eligible for caning.

243    In _Public Prosecutor v Ran Weidong_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGMC 85</span> (“_Ran Weidong_”),[^266] also a case cited by the Prosecution, the offender was a masseur who had deceived the victim into believing that he needed to massage her waist to relieve her ankle pain. The offender rolled-up the victim’s shorts, exposed her buttocks and outraged her modesty by rubbing her vulva twice whilst massaging the length of her legs. A sentence of 14 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane was imposed.

244    While the offence-specific factors of an abuse of trust and the use of deception similarly arose in _Ran Weidong_, I was mindful that the degree of sexual exploitation was _marginally_ higher given the _repeated skin-to-skin_ intrusions into the victim’s private parts. The latter did not feature in the present case since the multiple incursions were to the Complainant’s clothed vagina. Nonetheless, in my judgment, any reduction in sentence would only be marginal to account for the fact that there were far more intrusions (no less than 12) into the Complainant’s private parts than in _Ran Weidong_ (only two). For these reasons, I concluded that caning with an imprisonment term _marginally_ lower than 14 months’, was indicated in the present case.

245    My observations vis-à-vis the cases cited by the Defence, are as follows. In _GCO v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 1402</span> (_“GCO”_), the offender had pleaded guilty to, _inter alia_, molesting the victim by touching her “vagina area” beneath her shorts but over her underwear while she was asleep. On appeal, the High Court found that there was a high degree of sexual exploitation as the facts involved an intrusion into the victim’s private parts whilst she was asleep and vulnerable. Whilst the custodial sentence of 8 months’ imprisonment was upheld on appeal, the High Court set aside the first instance sentence of caning, observing thus (at \[94\]):

> 
| 

In my view, caning ought not to be imposed in this case. **Caning has typically been imposed** on offenders in cases applying the Kunasekaran framework where there was skin-to-skin contact, or the **contact was prolonged**, or there was an **element of restraint** applied to the victim, although **these aggravating factors should not be taken to be exhaustive**. **None of these three factors is present here** … **There is nothing to suggest that the appellant sought deliberately to prolong the contact, or that he persisted after the second victim woke up.** Nor is there any suggestion of abuse of trust …

 |

  
  

246    In my assessment, _GCO_ stands as appellate authority that _minimally_, a tariff of eight months’ imprisonment extends to cases which feature the offence-specific factors of intrusion over the clothed private part of a sleeping victim. In contrast to _GCO_, the present case involved a far higher degree of sexual exploitation in terms of nature, duration and intensity. While there was a _single instance_ of contact between the offender’s hand and the victim’s clothed ‘vagina area’ in _GCO_, in the present case there was _persistent and prolonged contact_ with the Complainant’s vagina. Further, while _GCO_ involved the molestation of a sleeping and hence vulnerable victim, the present case engaged _three_ significant offence-specific factors (an abuse of trust, the use of deception and harm to the victim). For these reasons, the Accused’s culpability was more amplified than the offender in _GCO_ and warranting of not just a longer custodial term, but also the imposition of caning.

247    In _Public Prosecutor v Thaw Zin Oo_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGMC 47</span> (“_Thaw_”),[^267] the offender claimed trial to kissing the victim on her lips and touching her “crotch area” over her jeans. In sentencing the offender to 6 months’ imprisonment, the Court noted that there was no skin-on-skin contact, the victim was not vulnerable and had not suffered any emotional or psychological harm after the incident.[^268] In juxtaposition to the lower degree of sexual exploitation in _Thaw_, the Accused’s palpably more intrusive sexual exploitation of the Complainant, coupled with the abuse of trust, the use of deception and evidence of harm suffered, demanded a concomitantly higher custodial sentence and the imposition of caning.

248    Next, I considered the case of _Kunasekaran_, where the offender was convicted after trial for touching his 14-year-old victim’s “groin area” over her school uniform, with his fingers. The offence occurred onboard a public bus. At first instance, the offender was sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment, and, although being above the age of 50 and ineligible for caning, no additional imprisonment in lieu of caning was imposed. The sentence was upheld on appeal even though the High Court found that the offender had intruded into the victim’s groin area (as opposed to her vagina).

249    The affirmation on appeal of the sentence of eight months’ imprisonment for the act of molestation performed over clothing, reinforces the point that intrusions to private parts (even if merely the groin area) are regarded with especial gravity in sentencing, whether they are committed over or under the victim’s garments.

250    While the offence-specific factors such as the commission of the offence on public transport and psychological harm to the victim in _Kunasekaran_ were counterbalanced by other offence-specific factors (such as the abuse of trust, the use of deception and some evidence of psychological harm) in the present case, it was patent yet again, that the higher degree of sexual exploitation in this case necessitated a correspondingly higher sentence.

251    As for caning, I was mindful that the issue was considered in _Kunasekaran_ in the context of the High Court determining if there were grounds to exercise its discretion to impose a term of imprisonment in lieu of caning as the offender, who was above 50 years of age, was statutorily ineligible for caning. After considering the aggravating factors, the High Court held that “the sentencing considerations that _displace_ the starting position that an offender’s term of imprisonment should not be enhanced just because he is exempted from caning are not present.” It was clear that the calculus in _Kunasekaran_ was different as the offender was ineligible for caning and the High Court’s consideration was thus confined to an assessment of whether it was an appropriate case to displace the principle that imprisonment should not be enhanced unless there are grounds to do so[\[note: 269\]](#Ftn_269) and impose an additional imprisonment term in lieu of caning.

252    Thus viewed, the decision not to impose imprisonment in lieu of caning in _Kunasekaran_, did not constrain or otherwise impinge upon my assessment that caning was appropriate on the facts of the present case.

253    In _Public Prosecutor v Clement Tan Jun Yan_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 201</span> (“_Clement Tan_”),[^270] the offender pleaded guilty to two counts of outraging the modesty of two young victims. He was sentenced to 8 months’ imprisonment for a fleeting touch of the first victim’s clothed penis and 10 months’ imprisonment for squeezing the second victim’s clothed buttocks twice. I was mindful that the latter was imposed in respect of an offence under s 354(2) of the Penal Code. I did not find _Clement Tan_ to be a useful comparator as the sentences pertained to, (i) an offender who had pleaded guilty, and to (ii) offences which involved a significantly lower degree of sexual exploitation.

254    The Defence also cited _Public Prosecutor v GDX_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 142</span> (“_GDX_”),[^271] where the offender had claimed trial to three charges of outraging the modesty of his three step-daughters. I do not delve into the specific facts of this case apart from observing that (again) given the wholly different factual matrix, I did not find this case to be a relevant or useful precedent for consideration.

255    In the final analysis, I do not find the sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane imposed on the Accused to be inconsistent with the precedents cited by either party. Ultimately, there is great variance in the manner in which an offence of outrage of modesty can present itself and each case presents with different offence-specific factors. Sentencing in the end, is fact-specific. Thus, while other cases may provide some guidance, the more principled methodology for arriving at the appropriate sentence, is to apply the _Kunasekaran_ framework and consider where the present case falls. This is what I have done.

## Compensation Order

256    The nature and purpose of the Court’s power to order compensation, and the factors guiding this assessment, have been discussed in the cases of _Soh Meiyun v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 3 SLR 299</span> (at \[54\] – \[60\]) and _Tay Wee Kiat v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 114</span> (at \[5\] – \[11\]). Under s 359 of the CPC, the Court is obliged to consider whether or not to make a compensation order; and if it is of the view that such an order would be appropriate, it has a further obligation to make the order.

257    As there was clear and credible evidence before me as to the medical expenses incurred by the Complainant in seeking treatment for the psychological injury suffered as a result of the Accused’s offence, I determined that it was appropriate to make a compensation order. These expenses, which were substantiated with proof of payment to the Complainant’s psychologist,[\[note: 272\]](#Ftn_272) were not disputed by the Defence.

258    I thus ordered the Accused to compensate the Complainant in the sum of $300 (in default 1 day imprisonment).

## Conclusion

259    Sexual violence in all its forms, is a fundamental affront to our values as a society and demands a robust response from the Courts.

260    I convicted the Accused as I was satisfied, after an assiduous assessment of the evidence, that the Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. In my judgment, a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane adequately addresses the need for deterrence in offences of this genre. The Accused remains on bail pending the outcome of this appeal.

[^172]: In this regard, a plain reading of Q9 and A9 of Exhibit P10, clearly showed the Accused explaining why he knew the door was not locked and providing the context for how he knew it was not locked. This laid to rest the suggestion that IO Jane had mixed-up the Accused’s answers.

[^173]: See the final line on pg. 1 of Exhibit P10 which states, “I did not touched (sic) her inappropriately at any point of time”. Whereas A12 and A14 of Exhibit P10 contain an admission to the contrary.
