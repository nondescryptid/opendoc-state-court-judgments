Criminal Law – Penal Code – Outrage of modesty contrary to section 354(1) of the Penal Code – Criminal force involved carrying complainant off a stool

8 June 2022

### District Judge Marvin Bay:

INTRODUCTION

### Charge and outline of case

1       The accused, Liu Haibin aged 33, a PRC national, had claimed trial against single charge[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) contrary s 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”).

> (Mr Liu is) charged that (he), on the 30 day of November 2018, at about 7.15pm, in the apartment (number) The Tropica, 55 Tampines Avenue 1 Singapore, did use criminal force on one (Mc C) (female), to wit, by wrapping your arms around her torso and carrying her down to the floor while she was standing on a small table, knowing it to be likely that (he) would thereby outrage her modesty, and (he has) thereby committed an offence punishable under s 354(1) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224

2       It should be noted that the bodily contact complained of, which is that of ''_wrapping_ (his) _arms around_ (Ms C's_)__[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) torso and carrying her down to the floor while she was standing on a small table_'' was not disputed. Hence, the _actus reus_ of the charge was not disputed by Mr Liu, whose principal line of defence was that while he had indeed carried Ms C by her torso, he had done this in a bid to prevent her from falling off a small table. It should be noted that this defence was **_not_** communicated by him to police investigators.

### Description of table/cabinet platform that complainant had stood on at the material time

3       I should add that the platform that Ms C was standing on has been variously described as a ‘_table_’ in the charge and a ‘_cabinet_’ by the complainant. This platform does, _albeit_ imperfectly, fulfil both descriptions, as images[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) documented by the police photographer, PW3, Inspector Chan Zhi Yao show this to be a table like structure, with two storage tiers built below the platform, and enclosed by four ‘_legs_’ which canted gently outward as they reached the ground. The first-tier was encased by a drawer and the second by an open shelf, where the images showed stored clothing items. The platform was not especially tall, reaching only just some six inches above Mr Liu’s knee. Parties had accepted that the platform was some 60 centimetres or two feet in height. From the images, the platform was a compact and squat structure which appeared sturdily constructed. For completeness, the complainant had reported her height as 1.58 metres[^4], while Mr Liu asserted that he stood at 1.78 metres[^5].

4       Ms C's contention was that Mr Liu had no reason to make any bodily contact with her, much less enclose his arms around her and carry her off the platform she was on, as she had neither been in, nor signalled, any distress necessitating the claimed rescue. It was also a significant feature of this case that Ms C had sent near-contemporaneous messages to her boyfriend and three of her friends alluding to the event.

### Penalty for outrage of modesty

5       In relation to the range of punishments provided for the offence, section 354(1) of the Penal Code at the time of the offence provided as follows:

> Whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any person, intending to outrage or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby outrage the modesty of that person, shall be punished with **_imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishments._**

> \[Emphasis added\]

### Witnesses called

6       Evidence was led in a trial which involved the testimonies of eight witnesses. There were some interpositions to the original order of witnesses as a result of exigencies of their availability to give testimony in the course of the trial. PW4 was the complainant herself. PW1 to PW3 and PW7 were procedural witnesses, while the remaining witnesses were witnesses of fact. The procedural witnesses offered nothing substantive, with nothing remarkable occurring during their processing of the case that had been initiated by Ms C’s complaint. Ms C herself was the prosecution’s key witness, as the salient interactions were between her and Mr Liu. The other witnesses generally provided contextual information as well as Ms C’s respective disclosures to them after the alleged event had occurred. As only Ms C and Mr Lu were in the apartment at the material time, one of these had witnessed the actual event.

### Undisputed background facts

7       Both sides to these proceedings had tendered an Agreed Statement of Facts[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) which primarily stipulated to that a number of _Wechat_ messages, and their translations to be undisputed. While not specifically averred to in the Agreed Statement of Facts, there is a substantial part of the background of this case which is also not disputed. This would include the fact that Mr Liu had been Ms C's “landlord”, having as main-tenant of the unit at _Tropica_ condominium, carved out a number of sub-tenancies from the letting of individual bedrooms within the apartment. From February 2018 to 11 December 2018, she had rented a room in the unit while the accused lived in the same apartment with his wife in a separate room. As the main tenant, Mr Liu exerted a measure of authority, imposing conditions on his sub-tenants, as readily evidenced by his message of 9 December 2018 to Ms C’s fiancée admonishing that “_Tomorrow 8-10pm, house owner(s) will come by to take a look, please remain quiet, clean up. If he requests, will also need to enter room(s), please cooperate_”[^7]_._

8       At the time of the incident on 30 November 2018, Ms C resided by herself in the rented room as her fiancée whom she had subsequently married; ''Mr H', had been required to attend an employment related-assignment in the African state of Guinea. There is also no dispute that before 30 November 2018, Mr Liu had enjoyed a cordial relationship, and had never been involved in any prior disagreement. Both had maintained their distance, however, and there was agreement that Mr Liu had never made any physical contact with Ms C in the ten months of her prior tenure in the apartment. At the material time, Ms C had learnt for Mr Liu that his wife had taken his in-laws on an excursion to the Marina Bay area.[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8)

### Common ground on events leading up to the incident forming the subject matter of the proceeded charge

9       In respect of the undisputed aspects of lead-up to the point preceding the incident, Mr Liu had on 30 November 2018, returned to his apartment at 7.10 pm after work, and found Ms C performing laundry chores in the laundry room. Mr Liu had them stood nearby at the doorway between the kitchen and the laundry room. As they were chatting at around 7.15 pm, Ms C had been standing with a foot on the small table (which was the object mentioned in the forgoing) and facing the window ledge while retrieving hanged clothes she had left out to dry. She had placed her right leg was on the small table, while her left leg was positioned on the window ledge. It should be made clear that there was a small enclosure outside the window to enclose the air conditioner compressors, and that there was no risk of Ms C suffering a fall from height even if she had slipped on the ledge and fallen through the window[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9). At some point, Ms C had made an exclamation '_'aiyah_''.

## The Prosecution’s case

### The complainant’s account

10     The Prosecution's case has it that Ms C had uttered the exclamation as an expression of exasperation when she had she inadvertently dropped some clothing articles she was hanging out to dry on the ledge beyond the window. Mr Liu had responded to Ms C's '_aiyah_' exclamation, and rushed over, reaching over the ledge with his left arm in a bid to retrieve the fallen clothing articles. At this point, Mr Liu's face was _''very close_'' to Ms C's left thigh, with the sheer proximity causing her some discomfiture. This had caused her to shift her position by pulling back her left leg from the window ledge and placing both legs on the small table. Ms C recalled telling Mr Liu that there was no need for him to pick up the clothes that had fallen outside. At the juncture, Ms C was bearing the load of several other pieces of clothing along with a number of clothes hangers, which she held close to her chest. According to her, Mr Liu had continued standing in close physical proximity facing the Ms C before hugging her suddenly by wrapping both hands around Ms C's waist and carrying her off the table and setting her on the floor. As Ms C was carried down, the motion caused her knee to brush against Mr Liu's groin, and she testified that she had felt her knee contacted an object at the groin that she believed to be Mr Liu's penis, and that the organ was in a tumescent or erect state at the time. She recalled that he was wearing a sleeveless T-shirt and knee-length shorts[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10) at the time.

11     Given that the prosecution’s case hinged on the account of this singular witness, it would be useful, with a view to assessing her as a witness, to reproduce her testimony _verbatim_ to obtain a sense of the forthright, spontaneous and unhesitant manner that Ms C gave her evidence[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11) While there seemed to be some stuttering and repeated words in the transcript, my impression was that these seemed to arise from the **_interpreter_**’s difficulty encountered in trying to keep pace with Ms C’s zeal and tendency to express herself in an overly rapid cadence in Mandarin, rather than from any uncertainty or inability on the complainant’s part, in recalling the sequence of events:

> My reaction was that I---I just said, “_aiyah_” that means my clothes dropped. And Liu Haibin said, “_Be careful_.” And then he ran over to the window in P3-4[^12] and he stretched out his left arm and he was going to pick up the clothes that had dropped outside the window. I said, “It’s ok---it’s okay, it’s okay. I will pick them up later myself.” At that time my left leg was still on window ledge.

> So, when he stretched out his left arm outside, he was actually---his---his---his face was actually very close to my thigh. And I said, “_It’s alright, it’s alright. I will pick that---pick them up myself later_.” And then I stepped back my left leg---with my left leg on the cabinet.

> At this moment, Liu Haibin was not able to pick up my clothes outside. So, I was standing on this cabinet and Liu Haibin was standing beside the cabinet. And he was facing on the direction of the rubbish chute that means he was facing me and I was also facing him.

> So, at that time he was standing beside the cabinet and I was standing on the cabinet, we were very close. **_And so, I was thinking to myself why didn’t he move and continued to stand there. So, this thought just flashed across my mind for around one second and he directly carried me down. And when he was carrying me down, his---the lower part of his body---his penis touched my knee._** At that time, I felt an object and when I---when I was being carried down, I was taken aback. I quickly ran back to my room and locked my room door.

> \[Emphasis added\]

### Consistency of testimony in describing the primary event and ability to recall peripheral details

12     I noted that Ms C **_remained consistent_** in separate instances where she had been asked to describe the sequence of events. In the follow through questioning, she had also demonstrated a **_good grasp of peripheral facts_**[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13) accompanying her situation, recalling the that at the material time she had been encumbered by clothing but had pointedly never asked for any assistance from Mr Liu to help her dismount from her elevated position. When asked if she had given any facial or non-verbal which might have conveyed her desire to be assisted in dismounting from the stool, Ms C’s evidence that she had merely withdrawn one foot from the window ledge and stood with both feet on the table/cabinet platform for just **_one or two seconds_** when Mr Liu had carried her off, adding that “_I had no time to react and then he carried me down_”[^14]. These dual aspects of consistency and situational awareness lent to an impression of Ms C as a convincing witness :

> I was holding a lot of clothes and standing on the cabinet and Liu Haibin was standing in front of me. So, I couldn’t move and I---I had wanted to turn left and go down but before I even thought of that’s, he carried me down. **_So, he is---both his arms were hugging around my waist area stretching to my back because there---there were clothes in front of me so he had to hug me tightly. And when he carried me down, his penis area touched my knee._** So, what my knee touched was an object. So, at that time I was taken aback--e-I quick---I immediately ran back to my room and I locked my room.

### Near-contemporaneous reporting of the event to her boyfriend and friends

13     Ms C had testified of experiencing shock and fear from Mr Liu's unexpected act and ran back to her room and thereafter, locking her door. Notwithstanding her reported state of shock and fear, it is a significant aspect of the case that Ms C had reported her account of the incident to a number of parties, near sent text messages through the WeChat application to three of her friends _\- Vanessa_, _Fiona_, and _Poppy_, and she had also notified her fiancée “Mr H’ of the developments earlier that morning. She had pondered over immediately telling Mr H but had vacillated as he was in Africa, and she feared that “_if I were to tell him_”, because “_he was so far away from me, I was afraid that he will be worried about me_.”[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15)

### Accused’s return of undergarment to complainant while she was texting her friends

14     In the immediate aftermath of the event, Ms C had resolved to send messages to the three female friends. As she did so, Ms C had heard Mr Liu knocking on the door of her rented bedroom. She had opened up the door, and seen Mr Liu with a bra that she had dropped. She had noted that the accused’s face and ears were “_flushed_” and seemed “_red_”.[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16) Ms C did not say anything and closed the door after receiving the undergarment. She estimated that this had occurred “_around 10 plus to15 minutes_”[^17] after the reported event.

### Background to the near-contemporaneous We Chat conversations

15      _Vanessa, Poppy_, and _Fiona_ were Ms C’s friends, and communicated _via_ a _We Chat_ group chat. Ms C added that there had been a fourth friend _Xiao Ying_ in the group, but the latter had returned to China[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18), and thus had not featured in the ensuing conversation through social media. _Vanessa_ was called, in the course of the trial, as a prosecution witness[^19].

16     In her _WeChat_ message with _Vanessa__[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20)_, Ms C had clearly described the incident:

> 
| 

Ms C:

 | 

Was so disgusted just now. I was collecting my laundry there.

 |
| 

Vanessa:

 | 

Why

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

Just happened that the landlord came over to ask me about the water heater. How was it. After that I was collecting my laundry. Was standing on top of the cabinet small table. Very squeezy outside the window...

 |
| 

Vanessa:

 | 

And then

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

He insisted on picking it up for me, was too close (for comfort) to me

 |
| 

Vanessa:

 | 

Oh gosh.

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

**_After that I was standing on the table he carried me down from the table suddenly_**.

 |
| 

\[Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

17     In Ms C's _WeChat_ messages with _Fiona_, the complainant had expressed her discomfiture and distress in unequivocal terms:

> 
| 

Ms C:

 | 

I was standing on the table collecting my laundry. When my clothes dropped, maybe he consciously reached out to help pick it up, the window was so squeezy. I was standing on the table. **_He said be careful, then suddenly he carried me down. Disgusting right_**. (_Expletive)_ this is my first time coming across such incident in all these years.

 |
| 

Fiona:

 | 

Indeed

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

That was at the window he consciously reached out his hand to pick up my clothes

 |
| 

Fiona:

 | 

What was that for

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

I could forget about it being squeezy but why carry me down.

 |
| 

\[Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

18     In Ms C's _WeCha_t messages with _Poppy_, the complainant had again registered her strong feelings:

> Ms C: I was bringing out laundry. Stood on the table. Then he came over to ask something. My clothes happened to drop outside the window He then reached out to pick up we both were exceptionally awkward very close to each other. I said it's okay **_he then \*Bao_** \[carried in the Chinese language\] **_me down_**. **_You say, isn't it damn disgusting_**.

> \[Emphasis added\]

### The absence of reference to the brushing contact with accused’s genitals in the WeChat conversations should not undermine the complainant’s credibility

19     It is a fact that **_no_** reference of Ms C's knee having contacted, with what she believed to be Mr Liu's penis in the course of her carriage down from the table _cum_ cabinet, was ever featured in the text messages. I was of the view that the absence of reference to this brushing contact in the _WeChat_ conversations ought not undermine Ms C’s credibility, as I accepted the complainant’s explanation that she needed time to process what had just happened, and it would have been extremely awkward to describe that aspect of the incident in text barely ten minutes after the incident, after she had locked herself in her room. In PW4’s own words[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21):

> I feel that I was deeply hurt by this. So, at that time, I was just able to relate roughly what happened. I do not have the courage at that time to type the words for everybody to see.

### The complainant’s claim to have received apparent verbal and text apologies from accused

20     Another notable development in this case was Ms C’s claim to have received an apparent apology from Mr Liu that very evening. This had occurred after Ms C emerged from her room to go to the washroom some two hours after the alleged incident[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22). She had closed the toilet door forcefully, and she had passed the accused who was seated in the living room, he had been heard to call out her name and utter _''bu hao yi si_'', which she understood to be an expression in Mandarin to state ''_sorry_'', and which she had taken to be a gesture of regret of “_his action of sexual harassment by carrying_ (Ms C) _down and his behaviour_”.[^23] Ms C surmised that the accused had uttered the words to gauge her state of mind and “_test_ (her) _reaction_”[^24] to assess if she might escalate the matter.

21     Yet another significant development occurred later that same night, 30 November 2018, at 9.34 pm, when Ms C reported that Mr Liu had sent a text message via _WeChat_ to her comprising only three Chinese characters: _''dui bu qi''_. Ms C had taken the characters to carry their colloquial meaning of ‘sorry’ and regarded thus as another apology. She noted, however, that Mr Liu had subsequently **_recalled_** the message, leaving just an annotation in the chat.[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25) . The apparent recall did not prevent Ms C from seeing the message before its recall.

22     Ms C had not received any further message from the accused that night, and the next massage in that chat had been her own on 1 December 2018 at 8.34 pm, where she had notified the accused of her intention to move out of the apartment by 12 December 2018. According to Ms C, she had been in continual contact with her fiancée since the evening of 30 November 2018, after the incident. The complainant indicated that she had assiduously updated the former of all developments, including Mr Liu’s two apology attempts, and had made plans to leave their rented room at _Tropica_ condominium at the earliest practical opportunity.

### Complainant’s communications with her then boyfriend; Mr H

23     Another aspect of Ms C’s contemporaneity was the fact that she had maintained a line of communication with her fiancée from the evening of the event. As mentioned above, Ms C’s fiancée had been working in the African country of Guinea and had worked there for two years. The couple had made plans for his return to work in Singapore once he had collected a sizeable bonus for his overseas work. Mr H, having obtained his permanent residency (PR), was eligible to apply for housing, which was an essential element of their plan to settle down in marriage. It was also her case that the alleged incident had thwarted these plans as her disclosure had precipitated Mr H’s premature return, and which had affected his eligibility for this bonus, and concomitantly his ability to make a down payment for a property[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26). Mr H’s return had originally been scheduled to be on 31 January 2019.

24     Ms C’s messages with her fiancée were recorded on 30 November 2018, at 11.37 Guinea time. Taking judicial notice of the time difference between Singapore and Guinea is our country being **_eight_** hours ahead of the African country, the text exchange would have been from 7.37 pm local time onwards. This is entirely consistent with Ms C’s account of notifying her fiancée just after her friends. The salient part of the complainant’s message was as follows:

> 
| 

**_At 7.37pm local time_**

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

I was standing on the table collecting my laundry. When my clothes dropped, maybe he consciously reached out to help pick up my clothes, the window was so cramped. I was standing on the table. He said to be careful, **_then suddenly he carried me down_** (series of expletives) **_I could not escape in time_**

So disgusting

So disgusting

 |
| 

(_After a WeChat call of 15 mins and 40 secs_)

 |
| 

Mr H

 | 

If he (does) this again, tell elder sister (_Mr Liu’s spouse_) straightaway

 |
| 

Ms C

 | 

I know, if it (happens) again I will scold

Will not talk from now on

…

 |
| 

**_At 8.03pm local time_**

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

You do not have to (rush) back. It’s just two months to go

 |
| 

**At 9.25 pm local time** (_in relation to Mr Liu’s purported apology_)

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

Just now I went to the toilet

Deliberately close the door

Very loudly

After coming out from the toilet

**_He call out to me saying_**

**_Sorry for_** (what happened) **_just now_**

Sorry

I shot him a glance and went into the room He was testing me dammit (_series of expletives_)

 |
| 

**_9:36 pm local time_** _(_ _in relation to Mr Liu’s purported recalled apology)_

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

**_He sent a sorry but recalled it_**

 |
| 

\[Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

### Why the complainant did not immediately make a police report

25     Ms C indicated that she and her fiancée had asked her “_to treat as if nothing had happened_” and for her to “_continue working as normal_” as she had begun employment with her new company less than three months from the material time. He had counselled her to wait until he was able to return to Singapore “_before we settle this issue and then we would move out of this place_”.[\[note: 27\]](#Ftn_27)

26     When asked by DPP Liu Yiwei what she had not immediately made a police report, Ms C had responded that she was in shock and needed to process what had just happened, and that she was operating under some constraints; not least her being alone in the country, and the need to maintain her employment responsibilities[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28):

DPP:

 | 

And on the 30th of November 2018 after the incident happened, why did you not call the police?

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

Firstly, after I contacted my boyfriend, my husband suggested that I should wait for him to come back before discussing this and at that time, I was staying alone at Tropica Condo. In the first instance, **_why didn’t I call the police? It was because at that time, I had a fright and my mind was in a blank_** and because I have just joined a new company and I’m still in my probation period, and the company had arranged for a fixed transport to pick us up every morning. So, at that time, I thought that I should not let such an incident affect my job.

 |
| 

DPP:

 | 

And my follow up question is, after---on the night of 30th November 2018, **_why did you still remain in the house_**?

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

**_I was working… the morning shift at the next morning_** and I have to wake up at 4:30 and **_I have no friends or relatives in Singapore_**. I do not wish to trouble others.

### Complainant’s revelation of event to fellow tenant Zheng Yu Geng

27     Continuing with her pace of near-contemporaneous communications and corroborative actions, Ms C had on next day, 1 December 2018, told another tenant, a certain Zheng Yu Geng (''Mr Zheng''), who had also a tenant in Mr Liu's unit, about the happens of the day before, stating that the latter had carried her. Mr Zheng recalled “_I think it was the next day after the incident_, (Ms C) _came over and told_” him and his erstwhile girlfriend that “_Liu Haibin carried her at the laundry area_”[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29). Mr Zheng elaborated further on Ms C disclosure[^30] :

> Q    What else did (Ms C) tell you?

> A    She was very frightened. She…ran back to her room. And Liu Haibin went to look for her once. I think she dropped clothing on the floor, so he went to return to her. And she told us that she might be moving. And after she moved out, she would tell Liu Haibin’s wife.

### Complainant had made immediate plans to leave the apartment

28     The evidence shows Ms C having almost immediately made plans to leave the apartment, on her ostensible basis that she had felt unsafe at the prospect of staying in the same premises as Mr Liu. This was corroborated by Vanessa who was a colleague, and who had been told of the event and where Ms C had intimated her desire to move to new environs.

29     Perhaps the most telling indication that Ms C and her erstwhile boyfriend were taking the incident with a high degree of seriousness was the fact of Mr Li arriving in Singapore on 7 December 2018, having cut short his plans to continue working in Africa until after the Chinese New Year period in 2019. This was reportedly at considerable cost to him as it meant a diminution of his bonus and ultimately affected the couple's plans to obtain permanent residency in Singapore at the time.

30     The couple had made good their plans to leave the _Tropica_ apartment and shifted out of the premises on 11 December 2018. It was also notable that on a date before 13 December 2018, Mr Li had texted the accused on _WeChat_ for an account as to what had transpired on 30 November 2018. Mr Liu had responded with a flat denial that he had carried Ms C by, and reportedly feigned ignorance of her concerns.

### Accused’s denial of any incident having occurred when confronted by her fiancé over WeChat

31     In the exchange of _WeChat_ messages sent from about 10.48 am on 13 December 2018, the accused had not just denied any untoward incident having occurred, but also affected umbrage about Mr H raising such a matter after having moved out. The exchange became increasingly tense with Ms C’s fiancé repeatedly accused of making a belated bid to “**_c_**_ame and settle scores/accounts/rake things up_”, and ran as follows.

> 
| 

Mr H:

 | 

My girlfriend was bringing/hanging clothes out to dry at the laundry room on 30 November 2018. **_When she was standing on the small table to bring/hang clothes out to dry, you carried her down from the small table by the windowsill???_**

 |
| 

Mr Liu:

 | 

**_No_**

**_I hug/carry her?_**

 |
| 

Mr H:

 | 

When I was in Africa, she urged me to go back!

 |
| 

Mr Liu:

 | 

I didn’t know she got you to return

**_You all have already moved out, why is she spouting nonsense_**

 |
| 

Mr H:

 | 

What exactly was going on that day?

I wish to know/understand/find out!

 |
| 

Mr Liu:

 | 

**_Didn’t say when_** (still) **_around, already left then came and settle scores/accounts/rake things up_**?

 |
| 

Mr H:

 | 

I wish to know/understand /find out!

 |
| 

Mr Liu:

 | 

(repeats)**_Didn’t say when_** (still) **_around, already left then came and settle scores/accounts/rake things up_**?

 |
| 

Mr H:

 | 

I just wish to ask!

 |
| 

Mr Liu:

 | 

Ask then

If there’s anything, you just ask

**_Recently I kept/always him[^31], was staying_** (there) **_fine why the need to move!_** I also don’t know, she suddenly wanted to move, I then agreed to let her go

 |
| 

Mr H:

 | 

I’m also very puzzled/perplexed,

 |
| 

\[Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

32     According to Ms C, the exchange was the trigger for her moving forward on 13 December 2018, to file a police report about the alleged outrage of modesty to her person, initiating investigations against Mr Liu. She had taken umbrage when informed of Mr Liu’s responses. In her own words:[\[note: 32\]](#Ftn_32)

> Actually, at that time, my husband---on that day, my husband sent a message to Liu Haibin and asked him whether this incident really happened and why did it happen? So, as to give him a chance to explain and he replied in _WeChat_ to my husband. **_He did not admit this incident and he said that I was talking nonsense_** and said that …why did I not …talk about this when I was at _Tropica_ and only …waited until I moved out to talk about with. There was no sense of apology or remorse from him, and **_he even maligned me saying that I was spouting nonsense_**. So, then we decided that says---this is the case, we should just report this to the police.

### Sequelae post police report

33     Two statements from Mr Liu were eventually recorded in the course of investigations for the case opened after Ms C’s report. These statements are consequential in the case brought by the prosecution against Mr Liu. These being particularly so in the manner that the accused’s recorded statements proved to be grossly discrepant with his court testimony. The statements will be considered in the later part of these grounds when the accused’s testimony is set out.

### Corroboration by complainant’s fiancée

34     Mr H was called as a prosecution witness, and his account corroborated Ms C’s version of events. On his part, Mr H indicated that he had, upon learning of her encounter, sought to console and reassure her “_so that she would not be nervous_.” He verified her account by stating his stance that “_whatever issues, she should wait for me to go back first before settling_.”[\[note: 33\]](#Ftn_33) Mr H himself admitted to feeling “very confused” and conflicted as to what he should do, as his intent was “_to console my wife first_” but her also had to “_minimise_” losses to his income and career. In respect of the latter, he had to “_resolve… work issues_” before he could return from the African state of Guinea.

35     Mr H had counselled Ms C “_not to do anything, until_ (he) _came back to Singapore_” as he had been worried about her “_personal safety_” being concerned that “_the other party would do something illegal or do something that would threaten_” Ms C, and his primary instinct was “_to protect my wife well before I come back to Singapore._”[\[note: 34\]](#Ftn_34) Mr H had also alluded to additional pressure from other parties when Mr Liu’s family members in China had allegedly “_gone to look for my wife’s parents twice_” and had involved a Chinese government official in the second instance[^35]. Nothing turns on these assertions as the claimed events would have occurred **_after_** Ms C had filed her report and did nothing to dent their resolve to follow through with Ms C’s complaint.

### The complainant’s fiancé seemed to act on a genuine belief that she was vulnerable while in sole occupation of their rented room at the Tropica condominium

36     What was cogent to the prosecution’s case was Mr H’s expressed perception that Ms C faced some unspecified risk while she remained, and his anxiety that she had to maintain a semblance of normalcy in the meantime, while he initiated steps for a premature return to Singapore. The fact of his expedition to leave Africa despite incurring a pecuniary cost showed that Mr H was acting with a genuine sense of urgency.

### Corroboration provided by PW 8 “Vanessa”

37     PW 8, Ms _Vanessa_, the colleague whom Ms C had confided in almost immediately after the alleged incident, had known the latter since end-September 2018. The two had met during a course of training provided by their company, when both first entered service. The two had initially been drawn to each other by the fact that their Chinese names were phonetically almost identical. By November 2018, Ms _Vanessa_ indicated that the two were on very good terms and she regarded their relationship to have evolved to being both friends and colleagues.

38     On the night of 30th November 2018, Ms Vanessa had received text messages from the complainant. In her own words[\[note: 36\]](#Ftn_36):

> That night Yu Jiao sent messages to me. Yu Jiao told me that her landlord did something … indecent to her. **_When … she was retrieving her clothes, he was very close to her and also hugged her._** And she quickly ran back to the room because she was very scared. Even when her underwear had drop, she did not pick it up because she was very scared. I do not know whether the underwear was referring to her bra or other types of underwear.

> {Emphasis added\]

39     Ms _Vanessa_ recalled asking the complainant whether there were any other people in the apartment, and also remembered advising her to “_quickly return to her room and lock the door_”. Other than the text messages recovered, Ms _Vanessa_ also recalled, after being told that Mr Liu’s mother-in-law was in Singapore, musing in her _WeChat_ calls “_How could he be so daring”_ and why Mr Liu was “_so shameless_”. Ms _Vanessa_ had followed through when she met the complainant the next morning at work at between 5:50 to 6:00am. In her interactions, she had again recounted “_what happened the night before_”, and the witness had noted that Ms C seemed to be “_very depressed and troubled_”.[\[note: 37\]](#Ftn_37)

### The complainant had discussed plans to leave the apartment the day after the incident

40     The witness had corroborated the complainant’s account that the latter had expeditiously made plans to leave her rented room. Ms Vanessa had interacted again with Ms C during a break at the work where the latter had raised the issue of having to find new lodgings because “_she did not want to see the current landlord_” as “_she was very scared and because her boyfriend was not around_.” Ms Vanessa again noted that Ms C seemed “_very troubled and she was very anxious_.”[\[note: 38\]](#Ftn_38)

41     Ms C’s resolve to leave the rented _Tropica_ bedroom was underscored in their third encounter at the end of the workday, when Ms Vanessa had witnessed Ms C crying upon the former’s query to her whether she was prepared to wait for Ms Vanessa’s off-day before she began her quest to find new lodgings. Ms Vanessa had asked why the complainant cried and been told emphatically that the latter had “_wanted to find lodgings quickly, so that she can move out_.” Ms Vanessa had found Ms C’s emotional state to be uncharacteristic of her usual “_very optimistic_” personality. In her view, the event Ms C had described “_must have affected her a lot_” as she was “_not a person who_ (cried) _easily_.”[\[note: 39\]](#Ftn_39)

### Submission of no case

42     At the conclusion of the prosecution’s case, counsel made a submission of no case[\[note: 40\]](#Ftn_40). Counsel’s submission was principally predicated on the premise that the prosecution had failed to prove that Mr Liu intended to outrage Ms C’s modesty, or known that his act was likely to cause such an outrage, arguing that the accused had merely reacted to Ms C’s exclamation of “_aiyah_” and taken matters in hand to “_prevent any accident from happening given that_ (Ms C) _was standing in hazardous position beside the window on the 4th storey of the flat_.”[^41]

43     I disagreed with counsel’s contentions in his no-case application. To say the least, it would not be possible to properly discern Mr Liu’s actual intent and state of mind when he carried Ms C from the table/cabinet **_without_** the court having had an opportunity to hear from him and consider his perspective. Given the evidence presented in the foregoing in respect of the testimonial, documentary and circumstantial evidence, especially in Mr Liu’s actions, which Ms C interpreted to be two bids to offer abrupt apologies in the wake of the event, I was satisfied that the prosecution had proven its case at least on a _prima facie_ basis, on the standard articulated in the oft quoted case of _Haw Tua Tau v Public Prosecutor_ \[1981-1982\] SLR(R), and called upon the accused to enter his defence.

## The Defence's case

44     Upon the administration of the allocution, Mr Liu elected to give evidence on his own behalf, as the sole witness for his defence. Mr Liu did not call his spouse even though she had featured in post event communications with Ms C.

### The accused’s account of events on 30 November 2018

45     Mr Liu’s account of the event was that he had prior to that struck an unremarkable conversation with Ms C after she had reimbursed him for a meal that he had purchased for her. Ms C had inquired where his wife was been told that she was out, having taken his in laws on an excursion to Marina Bay “_to have fun_”, and would “_return home after a while_”, to which she had commiserated that Mr Liu would be kept busy by their visit. Mr Liu had acknowledged that he had to balance his work with providing an itinerary to occupy his in-laws. The accused indicated that Ms C had stated her plan to move out a few days earlier and he had pressed her for a specific date that she would actually move out. Ms C had promised to revert on this date. After saying that, she walked away from him, and he had continued to send text messages to his wife.

46     After a while, the accused had gone to the kitchen to get something to eat. There, he had noted Ms C standing in the laundry room beside the washing machine. Mr Liu had then inquired if Ms C had any issues with the water heater, as he recalled a previous complaint by her that it was not working properly. He ended this topic of conversation by promising to observe the heater’s performance and undertaking to have repairs effected if the problem she had surfaced persisted. Thereafter Ms C had walked to the table/cabinet where the topic had changed to a quantity of _sushi_ he had bought for her and other sub-tenants a few days earlier. Ms C had thanked him for the _sushi_, and Mr Liu had responded that he had bought too much food, and that it was only proper to share the sushi. It was at this juncture, while he spoke, that Ms C had uttered “_aiyah_”. He had instantaneously called on her to “_Be careful_”. Mr Liu had run over without being aware of “_what happened to her_”. Reaching the Mr Liu had, in his own words, _“wrapped my hand around her and then save her from above and placed her on the ground_.” After the action, Mr Liu had recalled having taken a step back, and had noted Ms C’s change of disposition, where she had simply stood upright and “_did not say anything_”.[\[note: 42\]](#Ftn_42) Ms C had abruptly walked back to her room, leaving Mr Liu feeling “_awkward_” “_confused_” and “_puzzled_” as to why Ms C had suddenly ceased to talk to him, and disengaging from their interactions by retreating to her rented accommodations.

47     Mr Liu had switched off the lights in the toilet light and the laundry room, and then gone to the kitchen to retrieve a food item from the fridge. After taking the food, he had returned to the living room, and seen that Ms C had dropped an item of clothing. He had picked up the item, and then walked to her doorway and knocked on her door. When Ms C had opened the door, he had said, “_Xiaomei_[\[note: 43\]](#Ftn_43), your clothes dropped.” Ms C had taken the item of clothing and responded with a “_Thank you_”. Mr Liu had responded with “_You’re welcome_”. As he turned, he realised that Ms C had closed the door, and he had returned to the living room to consume his meal.

### Accused’s explanation of his apparent verbal and text apologies

48     The accused’s next interaction with Ms C had involved her forcefully slamming the door after egressing from the toilet, which had left him perplexed. When Ms C had come into view from the toilet, Mr Liu had stated “_I’m sorry, little sister_”. Mr Liu had planned to ask her why she had closed the door so forcefully. He was not aware if any “_misunderstanding or something_” had arisen. Mr Liu only noted that Ms C taking a glance at him as she continued to walk back to her room. Mr Liu had been “_quite puzzled_”

49     Mr Liu had then taken it on himself to send a message using his mobile phone as he wanted to ask her what happened. Mr Liu claimed that he had meant to send a message _''I'm sorry, but what happened_?''[\[note: 44\]](#Ftn_44) but had sent a truncated version with just _''I'm sorry''_. This was because he had, by his own account[^45], become lost in his thoughts speculating what he gone wrong, or if _''it was because when_ (he) _was saving her at the laundry area, there was an awkwardness_'' which _''could have caused some misunderstanding between_ (them).'' Nevertheless, after resolving that he did not do anything wrong, he had withdrawn the message, as he remonstrated, reasoning with himself, that this was the better course as “_maybe she had other issues_”. Matters had been uneventful until his wife’s return at about 10:30pm.

## Analysis of accused’s account of the happenings

50     Mr Liu of course makes no denial of his action of carrying Ms C off the table/cabinet where she had been perched at the material time. It should be noted that the very act of bodily carrying a person off an elevated platform would require the specific intrusive acts of wrapping and enclosing one’s arms around the torso, usually around the waist or hip area, and applying sufficient contact pressure on the parts of the body held to bear the weight of the person carried. This would necessarily be a **_deliberate_** action. While some defendants of cases of outrages of modesty would claim to have accidentally or carelessly made contact by a brush or swipe against a putative victim’s body, there could be no possibility of an inadvertent carriage of a person from an elevated platform. Simply put, the series of actions for carrying a person down is so mechanically complex that the act itself must always be a deliberate and planned one.

### Accused basis for belief that complainant would fall off the table/cabinet platform was unclear

51     Mr Liu’s defence was of course premised on the fact that he **_did_** carry Ms C off the table/cabinet platform, but that he had **_no_** intent to outrage the complainant’s modesty, and that he had embarked on this act with a specific intent to rescue Ms C when he had heard her exclamation and saw Ms C precariously on the table. He had apparently deduced that she was at imminent risk of fall, and thus acted to carry her off the table to convey her to safety. Curiously his account was **_sparse_** on his reasons for believing that the complainant would fall, merely stating that he was “_worried that maybe she was going to fall or what_”[\[note: 46\]](#Ftn_46) and reiterating again when asked by the court to clarify that he “_did not know what exactly happened to her”_ and had promptly acted to “_grab her waist_” and carry her to the ground when he had heard Ms C utter an “_aiyah_”.[^47] He strenuously denied that Ms C's knee had brushed over his erect penis while he was conveying her to the ground[^48]. The accused also denied that he had deliberately adopted a mode of carriage while conveying her down that would have caused such contact with his erect penis. [^49]

### Accused’s apologies after the event are inconsistent with his being a “rescuer”

52     The actual reactions of both complainant and defendant belie Mr Liu’s account. If the accused had indeed rescued Ms C, he would have expected a measure of gratitude for his gallantry and would have no occasion to issue two post-event apologies. Concomitantly, were Ms C to have perceived herself to be in s state of distress, she would have expressed gratitude for Mr Liu’s intervention, rather than display avoidant behaviour by quickly retreating to her room. At trial, Mr Liu claimed to be aware that something was amiss that night, but he was unaware if there had been a _''misunderstanding or something happened._''[\[note: 50\]](#Ftn_50)

53     Mr Liu claimed to have been perplexed by Ms C's glances at him as she returned to her room. In this regard, even if any potential “_misunderstanding_” could have eventuated from Ms Liu’s act, there appeared no reason that this could not have been **_immediately_** cleared up at the scene itself, if Mr Liu’s act of carrying her off the platform been truly amenable to be explained as a helpful and utilitarian act. This was especially so as Ms C was not a stranger, but a tenant who had stayed for a substantial term in the apartment. From the various accounts, the relationship had been cordial, with Ms C most recently benefiting from Mr _Liu’s_ largesse of _sushi_ which he had distributed to his tenants. Mr Liu had also helped her pay for a _Foodpanda_ meal when she had insufficient funds to pay the delivery person.

### Antecedent goodwill would have made it easy for accused to explain himself

54     In this context, where there had been so much antecedent goodwill between the complainant and the accused that any “_misunderstanding_” or awkward situation could have been resolved, should these have been capable of a simple or valid explanation. This is especially so, as when parties have a shared history of amicable dealings, they would be more likely to have a favourable impression of each other and be **_less_** likely to make **_adverse_** interpretations of the other party’s actions in **_ambiguous_** situations. This of course would not apply if the other party’s actions were **_unambiguously_** wrong or inappropriate. Hence given the accused’s position that what he did to rescue Ms C was a **_situationally appropriate_** response, it would have been rather incongruous for him to say _''bu hao yi si_'' to her after she exited the bathroom or thereafter send a _WeChat_ message of _''dui bu qi_'', which he had subsequently erased.

55     To recapitulate, Mr Liu's explanation for the first was that he had been perturbed after Ms C had forcefully slammed the toilet door. This had begged an explanation, which he had sought when Ms C had come into view from the toilet, Mr Liu had stated “_I’m sorry, little sister_”, with a view to attracting a conversation where Mr Liu had planned to ask her why she had closed the door so forcefully and allow him to appreciate if any “_misunderstanding or something_” had arisen. Mr Liu’s desire to communicate had been frustrated as Ms C had taken a cryptic glance at him as she continued to walk back to her room, leaving him “_quite puzzled_”.

56     For the second _WeChat_ message, as the earlier developments had left Mr Liu confused, he had then taken it on himself to send a message using his mobile phone as he planned to ask her what happened. Mr Liu claimed that he had meant to send a message _''I'm sorry, but what happened_?''[\[note: 51\]](#Ftn_51) but had sent a truncated version with just _''I'm sorry''_.

### Accused’s communications appeared to be outright apologies

57     To say the least, Mr Liu’s explanations were rather perplexing, given that the two sets of communication seemed to be explicit apologies from a plain understanding of the Chinese words used, and the offered context that these were intended as overture ‘trailers’ to start a conversation or elicit an explanation simply make no sense. This is given his position as the main or “master” tenant of the property, where he was in a position which was senior in status or authority _viz a viz_ his sub-tenants, of which Ms C was one. The accused was referred to as “_big/eldest brother_”[\[note: 52\]](#Ftn_52) in text messages. His position of authority within the group would have made it natural for Ms C to **_defer_** to him, should he wish to discuss any matter or issue connected with both their professional and personal relationship. The brusque tone of his text conversations in telling his sub tenants to prepare for an inspection by the owner of the apartment suggested that he was capable and comfortable in exercising this authority.

58     It was thus odd that Mr Liu would have become so hobbled by uncertainty or indecision thar he was incapable of **_following through_** with a verbal or chat conversation of his intended subject, which was that of checking with Ms C that all was well between them in the wake of his carrying her off the table/cabinet, after launching the two successive apparent apologies. Further, Mr Liu’s act of erasing his text (but not before Ms C had discerned the words he had originally sent) was deeply suspicious. The tentative nature of this act fuelled a sense that Mr Liu was aware by that point that Ms C had been deeply offended by his earlier actions. It could not be lost to him that Ms C might escalate to complain to her friends, relatives, or the authorities. Mr Liu’s failure to offer up his ‘_rescue_’ explanation for carrying her at this juncture would point to two possibilities, either that he had not yet formed this line of defence or born from an awareness that she would not have accepted his explanation.

### Accused’s admission that he gave false information in police statements

59     The aforesaid observations, however, all paled when considered with the fact that Mr Liu had acknowledged in court that he had given false information in two police statements when statements were sought to be recorded from him in connection with Ms C's complaints.

### Long statement dated 14 December 2018

60     The salient parts of the first police statement recorded on 14 December 2018[\[note: 53\]](#Ftn_53) are as follows:

> I am Liu Hai Bin. I am from China. My highest qualification is Degree in Civil Engineering in China, I can speak and write English. I am working as a business consultant for Ck Projects Pte Ltd for about 6 months and on employment pass… (_personal details on children and health_\].

> 2    I am staying at \[address\] with my wife and 7 tenants currently. I rent the unit for $3100. \[_details of agent_\]. The unit is a 4 bedroom and a living room. My wife and I occupy one master bedroom. The rest of the room(s) are rented out. Out of the 7 tenants, 6 of them are female.

> 3    On 14 December 2018 at about 8.40 am, I received a call from the police. I was told to proceed to Bedok Police Division for a statement…

> 4    \[Ms C and Mr H\] rented a room with(sic) me since October 2017. They occupy one room and the rental is $850 per month. We do not have any contract and we just agree verbally. She will always pay me the rental on time On 20 November 2018 in the evening, (Ms C) told me that she would like to terminate the contract. The last day of her rental is 12 December 2018.

> 5-6    \[_Background details on prior borrowing of $5 by accused and situation of family members on 30 November 2018_\]

> 7    (Ms C) usually wash(es) her clothing and she will hang her clothing at the service yard area. The service yard is near the kitchen area and outside the service yar(d) there is an air-con ledge. There is also a small stool placed in the service yard. The stool is for us to elevate our(selves) to hang the clothing outside. There (were) also some bamboo poles above the air-con ledge.

> 8    On 30 November 2018 at about 8 to 9pm, I can remember that (Ms C) was collecting clothes from the service yard. When she came out of the service yard, she was holding onto a bunch of clothing with both her hands. On the way to her room, she dropped some of her clothing. I was on the living room throughout and I saw her clothes dropped. Out of goodwill. I picked up her clothing which was drop(ped) in the living room floor to her.

> 9    I knocked on her door and she opened the door. I passed the clothing to her and I did not enter her room. I usually wear a singlet and a (pair of) shorts at home. **_When_** (Ms C) **_was bring_** \[sic\] **_down her clothes_**, **_I did not enter the service yard at all._** **_I did not know whether her clothes dropped onto the air-con ledge and at no point in time I assisted her to take her dropped clothes from the air-con ledge._**

> 10     **_I was told by the police that_** (Ms C) **_said that I grabbed her waist and carried her down from the stool in the service yard. I wish to state that I did not do such things. I do not know why she want to make an allegation against me._**

> 11    On 12 December 2018, I returned (deposits and remaining rental) There is no dispute between us over the sim. **_I also did not apologies_** (_sic_) to **_her because there is no reason for me to apologise to her._**

> 12 I do not have anything else to tell the police with regard to the allegations.

> \[Emphasis added\].

61     For ease of reference, the salient passages showing Mr Liu’s flat denial of his ever having carried Ms C from the platform are reproduced below. Notably there is a **_complete_** disavowal of anything notable having taken place at the material time other than that of Ms C having dropped some clothes, and his retrieval of the same for the complainant:

> 9 ... When (Ms C) was bring \[_sic_\] down her clothes, I did not enter the service yard at all. I did not know whether her clothes dropped onto the air-con ledge and at no point in time I assisted her to take her dropped clothes from the air-con ledge.

> 10    I was told by the police that (Ms C) said that I grabbed her waist and carried her down from the stool in the service yard. I wish to state that I did not do such things. I do not know why she want to make an allegation against me.

> 11    I also did not apologies (_sic_) to her because there is no reason for me to apologise to her.

\[emphasis added\].

### Further statement recorded on 21 June 2019

62     Mr Liu took a second chance to clarify, and again denied that he had ever laid hands on Ms C some six months later. This appeared to have been triggered by his strong disagreement with the proposed sanction that the investigation officer proposed. The second statement unfortunately sees Mr Liu taking a rather more derisive and vituperative tone against Ms C, to the extent of accusing her of being actuated by jealousy and attempting to destroy his marriage. The salient parts of the statement[\[note: 54\]](#Ftn_54) are set out.

> I was previously informed by (the assigned investigation officer) that she had concluded the Police case and she has decided to give me a conditional warning. I wish to state that I did not molest (Ms C), and I refuse to accept the warning. \[_Accused proceeds to complain about perceived ‘lapses’ in police investigations_\].

> 2    \[_Accused continues to question about adequacy of investigations and maintain his innocence_\].

> 3    \[_After Ms C sent messages to wife which the two analysed together_\] (W)**_e feel that_** (Ms C) **_had deliberately lied to her boyfriend about the incident so that she can use a valid excuse to move out of the house and also to buy his own house_**. She is also a work permit holder and wants to get a status to stay in Singapore permanently. As such she came up with this lie, so that her boyfriend would return top Singapore to take care of her once they get married and she would be able to obtain Singapore PR status.

> 4    In addition, (Ms C) and my wife are from the same city, which is Shandong, (_name of city_). However \[accused states that he and his spouse are employment pass holders and have a combined income of $10-$12 000\]. (Ms C) **_is probably jealous of my wife, having a comfortable and happy life and that is why she came up with this lie_**. \[_Accused asserts that Ms C has a malevolent motive and seeks to discredit him and cause a divorce of his marriage_\].

> 5     **_I also want to state that if I would_** (_sic_) **_to molest_** (Ms C), **_I wouldn’t have merely hugged her and not do further advancement_**. \[_Accused cites other situational factors that he claims makes molestation less likely_\].

> 6-8    \[_Accused claims that the recall of his apparent apology was done as he vacillated in posing queries to Ms C about her moving out date_\].

> 9-11  \[_Accused states that Ms C’s fiancé had asked him what had happened and asserts this would ‘prove’ that she_ “was lying as she can’t even explain herself” _to her fiancé and ends with a chronology of dealings with the latter_\].

### Accused explains why he lied in police statements

63     Mr Liu’s testimony in court, of course, could not be reconciled with the statements set out above, with the critical event of his carrying her down due to a perceived need to “_save_” the complainant in his oral evidence in court to be diametrically opposed in the statements steadfastly holding that no event bearing any semblance to that described incident ever occurred. Mr Liu’s explanation was simply that he was **_fearful_** of the police. In his own words[\[note: 55\]](#Ftn_55):

At that time, I had no lawyer and I was suddenly called by the police to go for investigations. I admit that at that time I did not tell the police directly. So this---at this part, I did not handle it properly. I hope that you can understand. Because at that time, **_I was really very frightened_**.

### Whether the accused’s false statements in his police statements amount to ‘Lucas Lies’

64     As can be seen from the reproduced passages, Mr Liu gave nothing less than a flat denial that he had even **_entered_** the service yard, much less therefore that he would have been in any position to have lain hands on the complainant at all, in his police statements. At trial, the accused went so far as to tell the learned DPP “_You can say that I was lying_” conversely conceding that he had indeed manhandled Ms C in the manner she had complained, albeit denying the “crotch brush” aspect of the incident, and while claiming his intent was to save her from what he envisaged to be a dangerous situation. The vehement denials in his police statements were thus acknowledged to be mere lies. More than that, I would agree with the prosecution that this showed that Mr Liu had been caught in a veritable thicket of _Lucas Lies_.

65     The principles concerning the application of _Lucas Lies_ (which concern a court’s treatment of an accused person’s statements which have been found to be untrue under certain specific presenting premises) are concisely stated in the High Court’s decision in _Er Joo Nguang and another v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 1 SLR(R) 756</span>, where Yong Pung How CJ held, at \[52\], as follows:

> The relevant authority on the effect of lies told by an accused is the English case of _R v Lucas_ (_Ruth_) <span class="citation">\[1981\] 1 QB 720</span>; \[1981\] 2 All ER 1008. There, the English Court of Appeal held that the mere fact that an accused told lies should not be taken as evidence of his guilt, although these lies could, in appropriate circumstances, amount to corroboration because it indicated a consciousness of guilt. Lord Lane CJ held at 724 that there were four criteria to be satisfied before an accused’s lie could amount to corroboration:

>> The lie … must first of all be deliberate. Secondly, it must relate to a _materia_l issue. Thirdly, _the motive for the lie must be a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth._ … Fourthly, the statement must be clearly shown to be a lie by \[independent\] evidence

> \[Emphasis in the original\]

66     The principles were revisited by the Court of Appeal in _Ilechukwu Uchechukwu Chukwudi_ _v_ _Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 90</span> (“_Ilechukwu_”), where the following observations were made in relation to Lucas Lies[^56]:

> 153    … In this exercise of determining whether lies and/or omissions of an accused person might be used to corroborate evidence of guilt, the following requirements set out in _Lucas_ (\[23\] _supra_) at 724 must be satisfied:

>> (a)    the lie told out of court is deliberate;

>> (b)    it relates to a material issue;

>> (c)    the motive for the lie is a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth; and

>> (d)    the statement must clearly be shown to be a lie by independent evidence.

> 154    Conceptually, the _Lucas_ principles can be viewed as a set of guidelines for aiding the court’s determination of whether to draw a species of adverse inference predicated on the lies and omissions of an accused person. Whilst there may be a distinction between lies and omissions in some cases, whether something is a lie is a question of fact to be determined by the court. In the present case, it is clear to us that there is no meaningful distinction between the Applicant’s lies and omissions in his statements.

> 155    The principles in _Lucas_ have been regularly endorsed by the Singapore courts…

67     To recapitulate, the passage in _Ilechukwu_ lists four recognised requirements for misrepresentations to amount to _Lucas Lies_. These requirements will be juxtaposed with the present factual matrix in the discussion later in these grounds. These requirements stipulate that:

> (a)     The lie told is deliberate;

> (b)     The lie relates to a material issue;

> (c)     The motive for the lie is a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth; and

> (d)     The statement must clearly be shown to be a lie by independent evidence.

### Accused repeats his reason for lying when subsequently questioned by the court

68     It was upon cross-examination by the learned DPP that Mr Liu conceded that he had deliberately lied in respect of the above passages[\[note: 57\]](#Ftn_57) in his long statement because he had a lack of experience in interacting with the police. It should be made clear that Mr Liu made an **_unequivocal_** admission to lying and had not misspoken or had a response somehow taken out of context. This is because the accused **_repeated_** his answer, adding in the subsequent juncture of responding to clarificatory **_questions by the court_**[^58] that that he was _''part worried and afraid_'' of being **_misunderstood_** when he was called by the authorities to provide a statement:

> 
| 

Court:

 | 

(Y)ou admitted that when the police asked you the first time around, you were not telling them the truth of what happened. Do you want to say again why that was so?

 |
| 

Acc:

 | 

…I have never have had much interaction…with the police

…14th of December, the police suddenly called me.

… At that time, **_I was part worried and afraid_**.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Alright.

 |
| 

Acc

 | 

The police wanted me to make the statement. At that time, I was frightened and worried. So, I was thinking that if I were to say that I carry her down, will they misunderstood me? So, I was very frightened and I did---did not dare to say.

**_I’ve been in Singapore for 7 to 8 years_**, and at that time, it was 6 to 7 years, **_so I know that molest is very serious. So, I did not dare to tell---to say this._**

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

I see. But to be clear if …what you did is to save the person, would it be not very obvious to you then that there is a legitimate reason for you to have done what you did?

 |
| 

Mr Liu:

 | 

**_But I was afraid that they will misunderstand_**.

 |
| 

\[Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

### Why accused’s explanation for failing to mention the incident in his police statement is unacceptable

69     With respect, Mr Liu's explanation for failing to provide the account he testified to in court, in his police statements, are **_untenable_** given that he had been living in Singapore for, by his own admission six to seven years prior to the event. He well understood the laws and usages of this country, as proven by his having undertaken a fairly complex business arrangement of becoming the main tenant of a property in Singapore and entering into sub-tenancies with seven tenants, including Ms C. Given his long prior stay and ability to navigate regulatory processes, he would be expected to be familiar with the professionalism, probity, and incorruptibility of public officers in general, and the Singapore Police force in particular, where criminal investigations were concerned, even if he had “_never_ (had) _much interaction with the police_”[\[note: 59\]](#Ftn_59) as claimed.

70     As the learned DPP has emphasized, Mr Liu has never asserted that he had been threatened by any officer at any point of time , and he was not raising any claim that the statement was involuntary or had been procured by any threat, inducement or promise offered by the officers. His explanation thus amounted merely to a claim that he had withheld giving a truthful account as he was “_part worried and afraid”_ that he would be _“misunderstood”._ Given that the incident occurred in late 2018, Mr Liu had had many opportunities to clarify on what he was to claim at his trial in July 2021, but failed to do so.

### The accused told a deliberate lie in his police statements from a realisation of guilt and fear of the truth

71     Returning to the criteria for _Lucas Lies_, Mr Liu had in his own testimony, acknowledged that he had, in his police statements, told a deliberate _lie_, on a _material issue_, which was whether he had indeed carried Ms C from the platform she was on, in the evening hours of 30 November 2018. In the morning of 13 December 2018, he had already a heated text exchange with Ms C’s fiancé, and, with considerable indignation, denied[\[note: 60\]](#Ftn_60) any incident having occurred. He thus had some advance notice that Ms C and her fiancé were taking an extremely serious view of the incident, and was availed a chance to assess the likelihood of their escalation by filing a police report.

72     Mr Liu therefore had ample time to reflect on the manner and substance of how and what he would represent of the events that had transpired that evening, when he was asked to provide a police statement the next day. That Mr Liu would have chosen **_again_** to give a flat denial would show his motive to lie. This motive to lie in turn, must have had its _provenance_ from a “_realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth_”. This is all the more pronounced by Mr Liu’s concession that “_I know that molest is very serious. So, I did not dare to tell---to say this_”[\[note: 61\]](#Ftn_61) in his court testimony. All in all, the contradiction between his police statements and his court testimony severely undermined any semblance of internal consistency in Mr Liu’s case. As a long-term resident in this country, I do not doubt that Mr Liu understood the **_seriousness_** of stating the truth as the deponent of the two police statements, and the potentially severe consequences of giving a false statement to the police or indeed any public officer.[^62]

### Guidance on the “unusually convincing” standard by the Court of Appeal in Public Prosecutor v GCK

73     I now turn in contrast to the complainant; Ms C’s evidence. In addressing whether Ms C was a reliable witness, I would be of the view that she would, in a **_holistic_** survey of the case, have met the standard of being an ‘_unusually convincing_’ witness. In the case of _Public Prosecutor_ v _GCK and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 486</span>; <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 2</span> (“_GCK_”) the Court of Appeal made clear that any evaluation of whether a witness’ evidence met the _unusually convincing_ standard in cases of competing testimonies between the suspected offender and the putative victim would encompass a **_holistic_** scrutiny of the **_totality_** of the evidence.

74     Simply put, the reliability of a witness’s power of observations and account “_must be assessed in the light of_ **_all the circumstances_** _in each individual case_”[\[note: 63\]](#Ftn_63). The Court of Appeal’s clear guidance on this holistic approach to evaluating a witness’ evidence is set out below[^64]:

> (g)    The second way in which a reasonable doubt may arise is on **_an assessment of_** **_the totality of the evidence_****_. The inquiry here is intimately connected with the “unusually convincing” standard, which arises in the context of mutually exclusive and competing testimonies._** The “unusually convincing” standard sets the threshold for a witness’s testimony to be preferred over the evidence put forth by the accused person where it is a case of one person’s word against another’s.

> (h)     **_The assessment of the Prosecution’s evidence under the “unusually convincing” standard must be made with regard to the totality of the evidence, which logically includes the case mounted by the Defence. The evaluative task is not just internal to the Prosecution’s case, but also_** **_comparative_** **_in nature_**. Where the evidential burden lies on the Defence and this has not been discharged, the court may find that the Prosecution has discharged its burden of proving its case against the accused person beyond a reasonable doubt. At this stage, regard may be had to weaknesses in the Defence’s case.

> (i)    …

> (j)    …

> (k)     **_Whether an eyewitness’s uncorroborated evidence is unusually convincing_** (and therefore capable of discharging the Prosecution’s burden of proving the case against the accused person beyond a reasonable doubt) **_requires an assessment of the_** **_internal and external consistencies_** **_of the eyewitness’s account, and of any other evidence that the court is bound to consider_**, **_which includes the Defence’s case and the evidence adduced by the accused person (or the lack thereof)_**…

> \[Emphasis added\]

75     In view of the above references in _GCK_ to evaluating witness testimonies for **_internal_** and **_external consistencies_**, and juxtapose against the case presented by the defence, it would be contextually apt to refer to _Farida Begam d/o Mohd Artham v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 592</span>; <span class="citation">\[2001\] SGHC 333</span>[^65] where the High Court divided the taxonomy for the assessment of a witness’ credibility in three domains (at \[9\] of the judgment):

> 9    A judge can make a finding on the credibility of a witness based on some or all of the following:

>> (a)    (The witness’s) **_demeanour_**.

>> (b)    The **_internal consistency_** (or lack thereof) in the content of (the witness’s) evidence.

>> (c)    The **_external consistency_** (or lack thereof) between the content of the evidence and extrinsic evidence (for example, the evidence of other witnesses, documentary evidence or exhibits).

## Why accused’s version of events suffers from internal and external inconsistencies

### There was never any need to physically carry the complainant off her platform

76     Other than Mr Liu’s egregious act of lying in his police statements, which rendered the accused with having told two diametrically opposed accounts, which remained irreconcilable despite his purported explanation. Mr Liu's account of immediately acting to carry her down out of a fear of her falling does not make sense as the most **_rational_** response to prevent a person on a higher position from falling would be to stabilise the person in place by **_bracing_** the persons lower limbs with either his hand, forearms or elbow, which Mr Liu was in a perfect vantage point to do. He would then merely have made contact with her extremities around her ankles or calves, and avoided cradling her waist or other part of the trunk, which most would regard as a far more intimate body parts, and areas where the person so touched would more readily develop a sense of bodily violation.

77     The images recorded of the table/cabinet showing the object’s dimensions and its placement did not cohere with Mr Liu’s account of his apprehension that Ms C would be in any danger of serious injury. The drop to floor level at the kitchen, was just 60 centimetres, and as alluded to earlier[\[note: 66\]](#Ftn_66), Ms C was **_never_** at risk of any fall from height even if she had fallen over the ledge, which would have been all the more unlikely if she were perched with **_both_** her feet on the table/cabinet platform at the time of Mr Liu’s sudden act of carriage from that platform. Further, to say the least, Mr Liu’s two halting attempts to apologise do not cohere with his account of performing what he had characterised as an indisputably gallant act of intervening to “_prevent any accident from happening given that_ (Ms C) _was standing in hazardous position beside the window on the 4th storey of the flat_.”[^67]

## Why the complainant’s account ought be regarded as unusually convincing

78     As stated in the foregoing[\[note: 68\]](#Ftn_68), I was satisfied that Ms C's evidence fulfils all conditions to be considered unusually convincing, and I would hold this view noting her demeanour as well as the internal and external consistency of her testimony, juxtaposed with other testimonies and documentary exhibits. Ms C had withstood what the learned DPP aptly described as _''prolonged and intensive cross-examination_'' and _''remained steadfast in recounting the events on 30 November 2018 and in establishing how the accused's actions in carrying her down from the small table were deliberate and not for the purpose of saving her as claimed by the defence_.'' [^69]

### The complainant did not exclaim ‘aiyah’ in a distressed or fearful tone

79     I accept Ms C's account that she did not utter ‘_aiyah’_ from distress or fear of falling off the small table at any point in time during her interaction with the accused, and that her exclamation was in a tone of mild exasperation at having dropped her clothes. As elucidated above, Ms C was objectively never in any **_actual_** risk of significant injury from falling off the small table, as for **_perceived_** danger, she was also well aware that she was not in any jeopardy. as she had going up and down the small table for the many months that she had been a sub-tenant in the apartment.

80     Ms C adequately explains herself in her testimony. In her own words:

> 
| 

Ms C:

 | 

Because this ''_aiyah'_' is not ''_aiyah_'' because I---I was going to fall down. '_'Aiyah_'' is an expression. When you are trying to reach something and when something dropped, you will give a sound. So, that---the ''_aiyah_'' was the sound that I---I was expressing at that time. But the ''_aiyah_'' does not mean that I was in any danger.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

From what she is saying is a term of vexation or frustration.

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

No. Because I was keeping my clothes. And when it dropped, and I just said ''_aiyah_''. It's like saying, ''Hey, my clothes dropped.'' So, it is just a very light sound. But what the lawyer explained---expressed as '_'aiyah_'' it seems like I was in danger or something like that. \[emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

### External consistency from corroboration through near-contemporaneous complaints

81     It is notable that on the same day at 7.37 pm, well within half an hour from the projected time of the incident, Ms C had told her fiancé and eventual husband her version of the event stating:

> I was standing on the table collecting my laundry. When my clothes dropped, maybe he consciously reached out to help pick up my clothes, the window was so cramped. I was standing on the table. He said to be careful, **_then suddenly he carried me down_**. \[emphasis added\]

82     There was a ring of **_internal_** consistency around Ms C's account that Mr Liu had started off by attempting to pick up her dropped clothing, rather than carrying her down immediately which was his account. Unlike the accused’s vacillations on how, or even **_if_**, the incident had taken place in his various accounts in his police statements and court testimony, Ms C had maintained essentially the **_same_** account from the evening of 30 November 2018 to the day she gave her evidence, in mid-May 2021. This was also consistent with her immediate response of shock and anxiety when he had carried her down, demonstrating that she could not discern any **_legitimate_** motive for his action. If she had truly been in any danger or even just **_perceived_** herself to be at risk of fall, the **_reason_** for Mr Liu undertaking such an act would have been self-evident, and she would had no occasion to react with such a level of heightened anxiety, and indeed near-panic, to the point of wishing to leaving the _Tropica_ apartment in an expedited fashion.

83     On the aspect of **_external_** consistency, while the event had occurred with just Mr Liu and Ms C at the scene, Ms C was able to demonstrate an almost immediate documentation of her response to the incident, from the messages to her three friends, “_Vanessa_”, “_Fiona_” and “_Poppy_” and her erstwhile fiancé. The accounts never wavered, and she continued to make contemporaneous observations in her messages in relation to Mr Liu’s overtures to her to tender what seem to be tentative apologies. There is also corroboration of her distress when she had met “_Vanessa_” the next day, and communicated her earnest desire to leave the apartment as soon as possible. Another tenant, Mr Zheng Yu Geng had corroborated Ms C’s version, noted that she appeared “_very frightened_” and also of Ms C telling him on the day after the incident that she had run back into the room, and also of the accused having approached her to return an item of clothing she had dropped clothing on the floor during her flight. Mr Zheng testified to Ms C intimating that “_she might be moving_”.

### Complainant’s omission of the ‘crotch brush’ in her text messages should not diminish her credibility

84     To be clear, I do not find the complainant’s leaving out the description of having brushed against Mr Liu's crotch to affect her credibility in any significant way. At trial, Ms C’s expression of mortification upon the contact, compounded by the realisation that Mr Liu’s organ was in a seemingly tumescent state, was convincing. After a traumatic event has occurred, it would be reasonable to give some allowance for putative victims to **_process_** the traumatic incident mentally and psychologically. It would, in my judgment, be unrealistic for such victims to be expected to relate explicit anatomical descriptions in their contemporaneous communications.

85     Ms C reaction of revulsion and distress are, nevertheless, very clearly reflected in all of her communications with her three friends and her fiancé. As noted above, Ms C had no motive to frame Mr Liu, and had indeed paid a steep personal cost in various consequential actions making her decision to leave the apartment, which was consistent with the impression that she could not remain there after the event, and also in pursuing her case.

### Conviction

86     Ultimately, Mr Liu’s motives remained murky, as he had contested the charge, offering at trial just the specious assertion that he had sought to save Ms C from a fall, a contention which was utterly disproven from documented scene and testimonial evidence. His stance was notwithstanding the accused’s police statements that he was nowhere near her at the material time, and where he had followed through with salacious accusations of improper motives on the part of Ms C to frame him. Ultimately, for the purpose of my finding on conviction, it is less important whether Mr Liu’s act of manhandling Ms C was motivated in furtherance of a carnal intent, an overture to test Ms C’s interest in a romantic connection or simply an act of ill-considered and brazen bravado.

87     The more important consideration was that Mr Liu would have been very much **_aware_** that any bodily contact would have been treated as an unwelcome intrusion, and that his act of carrying her down, which encompassed embracing Ms C’s waist or hip area with his arms, maintaining her body close to his own trunk to bear her weight until he released her, would be regarded as a clear outrage of her modesty.

88     There was no reason for Mr Liu to have expected Ms C’s response to the act to be anything other than it being an abrupt unwelcome personal violation. This is especially where there had been no **_prior_** bodily contact between Ms C and Mr Liu before the incident, and parties had always dealt at arms-length, as evidenced by Ms C paying off a small sum that she had borrowed from the accused to pay for a food delivery. It could not be lost to Mr Liu that Ms C was even more likely to adopt an adverse interpretation of his actions, where the same had occurred while the two were alone in the kitchen, with her fiancé away in a distant country.

89     Considering the presented evidence in its entirety, this court found that the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt, and I therefore found the accused; Mr Liu Haibin, to be guilty as charged, and convicted him of the offence upon which the charge was premised.

### Sentencing considerations

90     Mr Liu has **_not_** appealed against the sentence imposed against him. Hence, there will be no need for a detailed analysis, and I will merely give a brief sketch to explain the reasons for the sentence he received in the interest of completeness in the record.

91     In sentencing, I accepted that the prosecution's recommendation that a non-custodial sentence would this appropriate in this case. This is given that the offending would fall within **_band one_** of the framework developed in the case of _Kunasekaran s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v Public Prosecutor_ \[2018\] SGHC 09. It appeared to me too that the molestation had been **_opportunistic_** rather than closely premeditated, with intent likely being formed at the scene, when Mr Liu had found himself alone with Ms C in the kitchen area.

92     In this case, there had been no intrusion on the intimate areas of Ms C’s body, such as on the breasts and genital area. Further, the contact with Mr Liu's genitals was possibly not deliberate. Nevertheless, there was certainly some shock and distress on the part of Ms C at being suddenly embraced by a person she did not know very well, while both were alone in Mr Liu's apartment. There is no discernible remorse shown. I note the regrettable aspersions cast against the victim in Mr Liu’s latter[\[note: 70\]](#Ftn_70) police statement.

93     In the circumstances, I imposed a **_fine_** of **$5000** in default two-weeks’ imprisonment.

### Present status of accused person

94     Mr Liu paid the imposed fine. As there was no custodial element in the accused’s sentence, no stay of execution or maintenance of bail pending appeal was necessary.

### Appreciation

95     In concluding, I would like to thank both defence counsel Peter Ong and the DPPs for their detailed and cogent submissions.
