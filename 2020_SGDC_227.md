Civil Procedure – Extension of time – Unless order

2 October 2020

### Deputy Registrar Lim Wen Juin:

1       This was the plaintiff’s second application for an extension of time to comply with an unless order after having failed to comply with it, the result of such failure being the dismissal of his claim in this action. I heard and dismissed the application on 17 September 2020. The consequence of my decision is that the plaintiff is forever prevented from bringing his claim because it is by now time-barred. I publish now my grounds of decision because I think that the circumstances of this case merit wider attention: there is reason to think that the plaintiff’s predicament might have been avoided with greater diligence on the part of Pritam Singh Gill & Co, the law firm that formerly acted for him.

2       I should emphasise at the outset that Pritam Singh Gill & Co has not had the opportunity to be heard in this application. But I think that the circumstances of this case are such as to invite inferences adverse to Pritam Singh Gill & Co or at least to call out for an explanation from that law firm. This is especially so given that – as I elaborate on later – I have personal knowledge of other cases in which plaintiffs represented by Pritam Singh Gill & Co also lost forever their right to litigate their claims because of breaches of unless orders.

3       The plaintiff in this case is an Indian national who was employed by the defendant as a construction worker. On 25 April 2016 the plaintiff was injured in an accident. His thumb was crushed by a manhole cover. The plaintiff commenced this action on 15 May 2018 claiming damages from the defendant to compensate him for his injuries on the basis that the accident was caused by the defendant’s negligence. He was represented by Pritam Singh Gill & Co.

4       In the course of the Court Dispute Resolution (“CDR”) process an unless order was made on 5 April 2019. This unless order required parties to file and serve their affidavits of evidence-in-chief (“AEICs”) by 10 May 2019, failing which the claim or defence (as the case may be) of the party in default would be struck out or dismissed without further order. The defendant filed and served its AEIC by the deadline but the plaintiff did not. Even though on the face of his AEIC the plaintiff signed it in India on 22 April 2019, weeks before the deadline of 10 May 2019, his AEIC was filed only on 23 May 2019.

5       Thereafter there was no activity in this action until the plaintiff filed a notice of change of solicitor on 13 November 2019 stating that Southern Law Corporation would be acting for him in place of Pritam Singh Gill & Co. This was about six months after the plaintiff’s failure to comply with the unless order. On 3 Dec 2019 the plaintiff filed his first application for an extension of time to comply with the unless order. That application was fixed to be heard by me on 6 January 2020 at 10.30am. By 12.26pm on that day no one from Southern Law Corporation had turned up in court for the hearing. Given that counsel for the defendant was in attendance I proceeded with the hearing in the absence of Southern Law Corporation and dismissed the application. To date I do not believe there has been any explanation for the absence of counsel for the plaintiff at that hearing.

6       On 28 February 2020 the plaintiff filed this application seeking the very same extension of time he had sought in his earlier application. It was supported by a solicitor’s affidavit filed by Ms Tan Siew Gek Suzanne which in substance contained nothing more than bare assertions (“the Plaintiff did not behave in an intentional or contumelious manner to defy the Unless Order” and his failure to comply “was due to extraneous circumstances”) and submissions (“the client should not be penalized and there is no prejudiced \[_sic_\] faced by the Defendants”, the plaintiff’s AEIC “introduces no new facts, exhibits and evidence”, and “this matter is time barred” and “the Plaintiff will be seriously prejudiced if the action is not reinstated as he is unable to commence fresh proceedings against the Defendants”). The plaintiff was given the opportunity to supplement this patently inadequate evidence and eventually he filed an affidavit that he had himself affirmed. He said in this affidavit that he had signed his AEIC on 22 April 2019 in India and “then sent the signed AEIC to the Solicitor that was handling \[his\] case” at the time, that is, Pritam Singh Gill & Co, but “instead of filing \[his\] AEIC on 10 May 2019, it was only filed on 23 May 2019”. He stated that the failure to comply was due to him “not following up” with Pritam Singh Gill & Co and having “assumed that \[his\] previous Solicitor got \[his\] AEIC and filed it on 10 May 2019”.

7       I did not think it controversial that when a party has failed to comply with an unless order and subsequently applies for an extension of time to comply with it that party “must show that he had made positive efforts to comply but was prevented from doing so by extraneous circumstances”: see the Court of Appeal decision _Syed Mohamed Abdul Muthaliff and another v Arjan Bhisham Chotrani_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 1 SLR(R) 361</span> (“_Syed Mohamed_”) at \[14\]. On the material before me it appeared that the plaintiff had made some attempt to comply with the unless order in that he had signed his AEIC on 22 April 2019, weeks before the deadline of 10 May 2019. The plaintiff did not specify in his affidavit when exactly the AEIC was sent to Pritam Singh Gill & Co, but I thought it implicit that he had sent it to them before the 10 May 2019 deadline.

8       But I could not discern in either of the affidavits filed in support of this application any “extraneous circumstances” that had prevented the plaintiff from complying with the unless order. So far as the plaintiff blamed himself for not having followed up with Pritam Singh Gill & Co to check that it had filed and served the AEIC, I would attribute fault to Pritam Singh Gill & Co rather than the plaintiff. It seemed to me that having done all that he had to do by signing his AEIC and sending it to his solicitors he was entitled to assume that his solicitors would proceed to file and serve it without further confirmation or enquiry from him. To state matters in a more direct way it seemed to me that the primary cause of the failure to file and serve the AEIC by the deadline was insufficient diligence on the part of Pritam Singh Gill & Co. But I understood it to be the law that the acts and omissions of a party’s solicitors are ordinarily taken to be the acts and omissions of that party itself, hence a want of diligence on the part of the solicitors would not qualify as an “extraneous” circumstance that could avail that party of relief from its default. As the Court of Appeal put it in _Syed Mohamed_ “it is trite law that incompetence of the solicitor is, without more, not a good defence” (at \[21\]).

9       Counsel for the plaintiff Mr Kerushnan s/o Sivalingkam argued at the hearing of this application that the plaintiff’s delay in filing his AEIC had not been too significant in that he had done so just 13 days after the deadline. I was prepared to accept that looked at in a broad and holistic manner 13 days was not an inordinately long time. Had the plaintiff sought relief from the consequences of breaching the unless order soon after his failure to comply it would have been easier for the court to be satisfied that he treated court orders with the seriousness that they warrant and so exercise discretion in his favour. But I found it highly problematic that the plaintiff had then been apparently content to let the matter lie for not less than six months after the failure to comply with the unless order. That I thought an inordinately long time.

10     In his affidavit the plaintiff explained that he “was dismayed and disheartened by how the matter was proceeding with \[his\] previous Solicitors” – that is, Pritam Singh Gill & Co – “and decided to approach new Solicitors for help which was when \[he\] came to know Southern Law Corporation”. It may be that, as the plaintiff seemed to imply, a want of diligence from Pritam Singh Gill & Co was at least part of the reason for the plaintiff’s otherwise inexplicable prolonged omission to apply for an extension of time to comply with the unless order. But to cite once more the words of the Court of Appeal in _Syed Mohamed_ the court should not have to “conduct almost impossible investigations in apportioning blame between the solicitor on the one hand and his client on the other” (at \[21\]). The point remained that the plaintiff’s delay in taking remedial action after the breach suggested an indifferent and lackadaisical attitude towards court orders that should not be condoned. I thought that if the result of breaching an unless order could be avoided in circumstances like these it would send the signal that the court is indulgent and quick to excuse breaches of its orders and directions even though there was no good reason for the failure to comply. From the point of view of the proper administration of justice that would be a wholly undesirable signal to send.

11     Mr Kerushnan stressed that there would be grave injustice to the plaintiff if I declined to grant the extension of time because he would not be able to commence a fresh action against the defendant. Given that the plaintiff’s action was one “for damages for negligence” in which “the damages claimed consist of or include damages in respect of personal injuries to the plaintiff”, the action could not be brought “after the expiration of 3 years from the date on which the cause of action accrued”: see ss 24A(1)–(2) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed). The date on which the cause of action accrued was 25 April 2016 being the date of the accident at work that caused the plaintiff injury, hence by the time of the hearing before me on 17 September 2020 it had long since become impossible for the plaintiff to commence a fresh action on this claim. But I agreed with counsel for the defendant Mr Phua Cheng Sye Charles that granting the plaintiff the extension of time he sought would cause much prejudice to the defendant because it would effectively deprive it of an absolute defence of limitation. Put another way, it would frustrate the defendant’s legitimate expectation that the plaintiff’s breach of the unless order coupled with the fact that the three-year limitation period had expired meant that the plaintiff’s claim had fallen away for good and the defendant could consider that a chapter closed. It would presumptively be fairer for any prejudice to fall on the plaintiff rather than the defendant given that the plaintiff had breached the unless order but the defendant had not. Therefore the undoubted injustice to the plaintiff could hardly be a weighty factor to take into account.

12     For these reasons I considered that there was no good cause to allow the plaintiff an extension of time to comply with the unless order. I reached this conclusion with no little regret given the draconian consequence that he would lose a viable claim against the defendant and given also his vulnerability as a foreign worker who had suffered injury while working in a land not his own. But however much the plaintiff deserved sympathy I did not think it open to me to jettison law and principle to give effect to my sympathies. Mr Phua correctly said that the plaintiff’s remedy, if any, would now lie against his former solicitors Pritam Singh Gill & Co and not the defendant.

13     The circumstances of this case were such as to raise at least a suspicion of a measure of neglect on the part of Pritam Singh Gill & Co. What made this more disquieting was that I had basis to think that this might not have been an isolated occurrence. I know personally of three cases that had in common with this case the following characteristics: (a) Pritam Singh Gill & Co acted for the plaintiff in a personal injury claim, (b) the plaintiff failed to comply with an unless order resulting in the claim being struck out or dismissed, (c) the plaintiff unsuccessfully applied for an extension of time to comply with the unless order, and (d) the ultimate consequence of the failure to comply with the unless order and the unsuccessful application to extend time for complying with it was that the plaintiff could no longer pursue the claim because more than three years had elapsed since the event that caused the plaintiff’s injuries and the claim had become time-barred. I elaborate now on these three cases.

14     The first case is District Court Suit No 517 of 2018 between Aziz bin Abu Yamin as plaintiff and Riduan bin Mohamed and Dynaglass Reinforced Plastic (Pte) Ltd as first and second defendants. The plaintiff was a Singaporean who was on 19 March 2015 involved in a motor accident while riding a motorcycle. He sustained various injuries including an elbow fracture and a ligament tear in his knee. In the course of the CDR process an unless order was made on 10 May 2019 requiring the plaintiff to file his AEIC by 29 May 2019, failing which the action would be dismissed. The plaintiff did not comply.

15     It was not until 23 October 2019 that the plaintiff filed his AEIC together with an application for an extension of time to comply with the unless order. In a solicitor’s affidavit filed by Mr Josh B Singh Gill in support of the application it was explained that “efforts were made to contact the Plaintiff through a phone number that was incorrect”, and thereafter “\[e\]fforts were made to locate the Plaintiff’s contact number and a working number was found”. The plaintiff himself later filed a supplementary affidavit in which he explained that he “had inadvertently given an incorrect handphone number” to Pritam Singh Gill & Co by reason of “short term memory loss”. After a few adjournments I heard the application on 16 January 2020. At this hearing counsel for the defendants pointed out that the plaintiff had provided a contact number in the police report that he had made on 23 March 2015 concerning the accident. It was not clear whether that contact number was correct or incorrect. Mr Josh Singh, who appeared for the plaintiff at the hearing, did not shed any light on that point. Mr Josh Singh also clarified that it was incorrect for him to have suggested in his affidavit that Pritam Singh Gill & Co had managed to obtain the plaintiff’s contact number after some effort on its part because it was in fact the plaintiff who had initiated contact by calling the law firm.

16     I dismissed the application because I found the explanation for failing to comply with the unless order wholly unsatisfactory. I thought it unacceptable that for five months or so after the unless order was made there was no apparent attempt to check the contact number that the plaintiff had provided in his police report. Even if that number was incorrect, given the gravity of the consequences of failing to comply with the unless order – the plaintiff’s claim was time-barred by then – I thought it inexplicable that no effort was made to seek the plaintiff out at the address he had furnished in the same police report. If I were to grant an extension of time in such unmeritorious circumstances it would be difficult to envisage any situation in which an extension of time would be refused. I thought that this would in practical terms mean no consequences for breaching unless orders except for payment of costs, which could not be right because it would undermine the authority of the court. I was naturally reluctant to dismiss the plaintiff’s application given that it would mean foreclosing a viable personal injury claim but I saw it as the only realistic course open to me.

17     The second case is District Court Suit No 1370 of 2018 between Solai Suresh Raja as plaintiff and Mantech Engineering Pte Ltd and DDW-PaxOcean Shipyard Pte Ltd as first and second defendants. The plaintiff was an Indian national working in Singapore who alleged that he was involved in an accident at work on 5 July 2016. He claimed that the accident caused him to sustain a foot fracture. In the course of the CDR process an unless order was made on 15 February 2019 requiring the plaintiff to file his AEIC by 29 March 2019, failing which the action would be struck out. The plaintiff failed to comply and instead filed his AEIC a few days late on 4 April 2019.

18     More than four months after that the plaintiff filed on 13 August 2019 an application to set aside the unless order but then withdrew it at the hearing on 11 September 2019. On 20 November 2019 he filed an application for an extension of time to comply with the unless order. That application was supported by an affidavit of Mr Josh Singh. The affidavit explained that after the unless order was made “efforts were made to locate the Plaintiff back in his hometown in India” but “the Plaintiff could not be located in time for the affirmation of his AEIC” because the address he had given of “_Vetrideikara Street, Kamuthi, Ramanathapuram_” was “a general address and not a specific address”. The application was dismissed – not by me – on 20 January 2020. How the matter went before me was that the plaintiff failed to file an appeal against that dismissal within the 14-day period for doing so, and on 7 February 2020 he filed an application for an extension of time to file his appeal that I heard on 6 March 2020. At the hearing Mr Josh Singh, appearing for the plaintiff, said that the plaintiff was withdrawing the application. I gave leave to withdraw and ordered that the plaintiff pay costs to the defendants.

19     The third case is District Court Suit No 2190 of 2014 between Makeinteran a/l Kaniappa as plaintiff and Ang Yee Loon and Lim Kok Lun as first and second defendants. The plaintiff was a Malaysian national who was on 26 July 2011 involved in a motor accident while riding a motorcycle. He sustained various injuries including a brain contusion and an open dislocation of his right little finger. Interlocutory judgment was entered by consent in January 2017 with the two defendants to pay collectively 48.2% of the damages assessed to be due to the plaintiff. The subsequent proceedings were pursued in a dilatory manner and an unless order was eventually made on 2 April 2019 requiring the plaintiff to file the notice of appointment for assessment of damages (“NOAD”) by 16 April 2019, failing which the plaintiff’s claim would be struck out. The plaintiff failed to comply.

20     It was not until 22 October 2019, no less than six months after the breach of the unless order, that the plaintiff filed an application for an extension of time to file the NOAD. This was dismissed but he thereafter filed a fresh application to set aside the unless order and to extend time to file the NOAD. The affidavit of Mr Josh Singh filed in support for that application contained no explanation for the failure to comply with the unless order other than a bare statement that this failure “was not intentional or contumelious”. After a few adjournments the application was fixed to be heard by me on 16 July 2020 at 3.30pm. This was a hearing conducted by video conferencing. By 4.36pm on the day no one from Pritam Singh Gill & Co had signed in for the hearing. Given that counsel for both defendants were in attendance I proceeded with the hearing in the absence of Pritam Singh Gill & Co and dismissed the plaintiff’s application.

21     Even if I had been able to disregard the absence of counsel for the plaintiff at the hearing I would have had no basis to allow the application given that the supporting affidavit lacked any proper explanation for the failure to comply with the unless order, let alone the prolonged inaction after the unless order was breached. The injustice to the plaintiff in this case was particularly stark because he had obtained interlocutory judgment by that time, meaning that there was no question at all that the defendants were liable to pay him some substantial measure of compensation.

22     As the Court of Appeal said in _Mitora Pte Ltd v Agritrade International (Pte) Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 3 SLR 1179</span>, unless orders are “a potent tool for the efficient and prompt administration of justice” which is “indispensable to the practical realisation of the rule of law” (at \[42\]). Even though it is necessary for the proper administration of justice that there should exist the threat of losing a case in court by reason of breaches of the procedural rules of civil litigation, it is of course not at all ideal for a case to be won or lost on that basis and not on the substantive merits of the parties’ positions. That was unfortunately what happened not only in this case but in three other cases, and to compound matters there was for the plaintiffs in these cases no turning back from losing the case because all their claims had become time-barred.

23     One common thread running through all four cases was the involvement of Pritam Singh Gill & Co as counsel for the plaintiffs. Again I emphasise that the law firm has not had the opportunity to explain itself in this application. But I consider that merely from what I have personally encountered enough has occurred to raise questions about the conduct of Pritam Singh Gill & Co that call for answers. That said it is not my function to conduct an investigation into such matters of professional conduct. I hope only that my making public the circumstances of this and the other three cases will somehow help to prevent or at least minimise the recurrence of this sort of unjust outcome.
