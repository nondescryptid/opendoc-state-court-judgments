19 July 2019

### District Judge Marvin Bay:

This are my grounds setting out the basis for the sentences imposed against Genocean Enterprises Pte Ltd, and the company’s directors: Shi Baoyi and Chen Ming, upon appeals brought by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) against the adequacy of the imposed penalties in the respective charges brought against each of them. Other than the URA charges, the company and its two officers also who faced a number of charges brought by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM). The MOM charges related to (_inter alia_) their provision of unacceptable housing of foreign workers that they had engaged. There has been **_no_** appeal either by prosecution or accused persons and entity against the MOM charges. The defence has not cross-appealed against the sentences imposed in the URA charges.

2       The URA charges in question concerned breaches of the Planning Act by Genocean Enterprises Pts Ltd and the two directors; Mr Shi and Mr Chen. Mr Shi and Mr Chen are both Singaporeans aged 46 and 53 at the time they were charged by the URA. Genocean Enterprises us a construction company operating with a complement of some 100 workers[^1]. According to URA’s Joint Statement of Facts[^2] ‘_Shi Baoyi and Chen Ming are the joint directors of Genocean Enterprises, While Shi was mainly in charge of matters relating to the workers, Chen handled the administrative matters such as finance and contracts. That said, they would discuss and make decisions together_.’

3       Genocean Enterprises pleaded guilty to the following charge[^3], and consented to the taking into consideration of two like charges[^4].

> You, M/S GENOCEAN ENTERPRISES PTE LTD

> Are charged that you, on or before 13 April 2015, did carry out development of land outside a conservation area, to wit by making a material change to the use of 73 and 75 Lorong 14 Geylang, Singapore 398959 and 398960 on Lot no 97466C MK 25 (“the Premises”) from residential use to that of a workers dormitory by lodging more than 8 workers in the Premises, without planning permission from the Competent Authority as required under section 12(1) of the Planning Act (Cap 232, 1998 Rev Ed) , and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 12(4) of the said Act.

4       Mr Shi Baoyi pleaded guilty to a similar charged framed in the following manner

> You, SHI BAOYI

> Are charged that you, being a director of M/S Genocean Enterprises Pte Ltd … a body corporate, which on or before 13 April 2015, did carry out development of land outside a conservation area, namely by making a material change to the use of 73 and 75 Lorong 14 Geylang, Singapore 398959 and 398960 on Lot no 97466C MK 25 (“the Premises”) from residential use to that of a workers dormitory by lodging more than 8 workers in the Premises, without planning permission from the Competent Authority as required under section 12(1) of the Planning Act (Cap 232, 1998 Rev Ed) , and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 12(4) of the Planning Act, and you have thereby by virtue of section 58 of the Planning Act also committed an offence punishable under section 12(4) Of The Planning Act.

5       Mr Chen’s charge[^5] is alike in all material respects to that faced by Mr Shi, and therefore need not be reproduced. Mr Chen has also agreed to the taking into consideration of a similar charge[^6].

### Background facts

6       The charges against the company and the two directors related to the unauthorised change of use of the same property; namely 73 and 75 Lorong 14 Geylang. The salient aspects of the Statement of Facts are set out below:

> 3.    Following the break-out of the two fires at two overcrowded illegal foreign worker dormitories of two walk-up apartments in Geylang, enforcement officers from the URA carried out a series of inspections in the vicinity of Geylang to clamp down on unauthorised foreign worker dormitories.

> 4.    On 13 April 2015 at 10.10 pm, the URA officers conducted a check at 73 and 75 Lorong 14 Geylang (the ‘Premises’). They discovered 17 rooms containing 116 bed spaces, and they found 66 foreign workers employed by Genocean Enterprises Pte Ltd and Genocean Construction Pte Ltd staying inside the Premises. These workers were not related to each other. The officers also discovered that the workers were staying in cramped and poor conditions living in the Premises. For example, the workers had erected make shift clothing lines, or in the ceiling of each room. Due to the size of each room and the number of workers staying in each room, there was insufficient space and the workers had to stack their belongings at the side of the bed or hung them under the top bunk of the bed. The total area for the Premises is around 298 square metres. **_As around 66 workers employed by Genocean Enterprises Pte Ltd and Genocean Construction Pte Ltd stayed in the Premises, this worked out to around 4.5 square meters of space per occupant._** At full occupancy of the 116 bed spaces, this would work out to around 2.57 metres of space per occupant.

> 5.    Apart from staying in cramped living conditions, the URA officers also spotted potential fire hazards. For example, electrical appliances which included fans, rice cookers and electric hot water kettles were placed very near the beds of the workers.

> …

> 7.    Investigations revealed that Genocean had entered into a 12-month tenancy agreement with Okeanos Pte Ltd to rent the premises at $14 000 per month starting from 1 January 2015. In this regard, one of the terms of the lease was for Genocean to use and occupy the premises for the purposes of carrying out an office or for residential use only, Shi Baoyi had signed on the tenancy agreement on behalf of Genocean.

> 8.    Investigations further reveal that prior to renting the Premises, Shi Baoyi had viewed the premises with an agent and he was informed that he could only house eight people in each unit. This was in line with URA’s guidelines for residential premises. In this regard the Premises was approved for residential use. Under the URA’s development control guidelines:

>> a    worker’s dormitory is defined as premises used primarily as lodging for workers unrelated by blood, marriage or adoption or legal guardianship; and

>> b.    Residential premises shall be deemed to be a worker’s dormitory if the total number of workers staying in the residential premises exceeds eight workers.

> 9.    Despite knowing the maximum number of workers that could be housed in the premises, the three accused persons blatantly disregarded this rule. There was also no application made to URA to convert the use of the premises from that of residential to a worker’s dormitory. **_Shi Baoyi admitted that while they did not make any alteration to the structure or layout of the Premises, they had shifted the furniture beds and mattresses found at the Premises._** This enabled them to house up to 116 workers, as evident by the number of bed spaces found.

> 10.    At the time of the inspection, the three accused persons had caused a material change of use to the Premises from that of a residential use to a worker’s dormitory, and no permission was granted for this change in use… \[_Emphasis added_\]

### Prescribed penalty

7       Genocean Enterprises had been charged under section 12(1) of the Planning Act (Cap 232) which proscribes against unauthorised subdivision, development and other works, and provides that:

> **12.(1**)    A person must not, without planning permission, carry out or permit the carrying out of any development of any land outside a conservation area.

This offence carries a maximum fine of $200 000.

8       Mr Shi and Mr Chen were implicated _vide_ section 58[^7] of the Act which attaches responsibility to any extant director who was not able to conjunctively prove that the offence had been committed without his consent or connivance, and had exercised the requisite level of due diligence to prevent the commission of the offence. Given their pleas of guilt and explicit admissions as to their respective roles in the running of Genocean Enterprises’ operations in the URA’s Statement of Facts, neither man was of course, making any assertions of this nature.

### Nexus between URA and MOM charges

9       In addition to the URA charges of using residential premises as improvised dormitories, contrary to the Planning Act which are the subject matter of this appeal, both directors and Genocean Enterprises also faced a considerable number of charges. This case had originally been scheduled for a joint URA and MOM trial before this court. The two sets of agency prosecutors and counsel had informed before the commencement of trial that the company, and its two implicated directors, intended to tender pleas of guilt to an agreed slate of proceeded charges.

10     The fact of the charges by the two agencies being dealt with in a single set of proceedings before me would certainly be indicative of their close relationship for the parties involves, as well as their connection within the factual matrix in relation to the proceeded and TIC charges. Due to this **_nexus_** between the MOM and URA charges which played a significant role in my decision in sentencing, it would be apposite to set out of the entirety of facts relevant to the action taken against Genocean Enterprises and its directors, with the MOM ‘_unacceptable accommodation’_ charges described and discussed in some detail. The facts below are gleaned for the MOM’s Statement of Facts, with some salient clarificatory details obtained in the course of the hearing.

### Background facts of the MOM charges

11     On 13 April 2015, after URA personnel conducted an inspection at the aforementioned private residential premises at 73 and 75 Lorong 14 Geylang, which had been rented by Genocean Enterprises on a one-year lease commencing from 1 January 2015, the case had been referred to MOM for the Ministry to carry out investigations into the possible contravention of the laws under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Chapter 91A).

12     MOM took cognisance that the said inspection on 13 April 2015 had uncovered the fact that sixty-six (66) employees of Genocean Enterprises had resided at 73 and 75 Lorong 14 Geylang. The MOM prosecution had proceeded on multiple charges which alleged that between March and April 2015, Genocean Enterprises had housed these men, within a group of the 66 individuals in the premises which fulfilled the definition of not being in an acceptable accommodation, on the premise that the number of occupants had contravened URA’s guidelines on the number of individual workers allowed to reside in residential premises.

13     The seven charges of ‘unacceptable accommodation’ that the MOM prosecutor[^8] has proceeded on were premised on a contravention of Condition 2 of Part III of the Fourth Schedule of the Employment of Foreign Manpower (Work Passes) Regulations 2012 (EFMR).

14     Condition 2 specifies:

> _The employer shall also ensure the foreign employee has_ **_acceptable accommodation_** _. Such accommodation must be consistent with any written law, directive, guideline, circular or other similar instrument issued by_ **_any competent authority_** _._

15     The competent authority in this case was the Urban Redevelopment Authority, which had imposed guidelines stipulating that the total number of workers staying in any residential premises should not exceed eight. If there were more than eight workers, the premises would be deemed as a workers’ dormitory, which required planning permission. The accused company and its directors had admitted to not having obtained any planning permission for the premises to be converted into a worker’s dormitory. In the premises the maximum number of workers that could be housed at 73 and 75 Lorong 14 Geylang could not exceed eight occupants.

### The ‘Unacceptable Accommodation’ charges brought by MOM (MAC 903880 to 903886 of 2017)

16     The seven charges; MAC 903880 to 903886 of 2017, brought by MOM against a director: Shi Baoyi, were all with reference to the same timeframe of the period between March to April 2015, where Genocean Enterprises being the employer of seven foreign employees, namely Messrs Adaikkalam Gunasekaran, Ahammed Mohammad Jubayer, He Weiming, Hoque Mohammad Abadul, Kulothungan Sathiyamoorthy, Murugesan Kannan and Rajamani Manivannan had all been housed with the other 59 workers, where the premises should not have housed more than eight persons, per the URA guidelines indicated above. The seven men were thus deemed to live in unacceptable conditions. These offences had been committed with the consent of the directors; Mr Shi and Mr Chen, as investigations had shown that the two had indeed arranged for the housing of the men at 73 and 75 Lorong 14 Geylang.

### The ‘Failure to Update Address’ charges (MAC 903920 - 903927 of 2017)

17     Mr Shi also faced another eight charges of failing to ensure that the workers’ **_actual_** accommodation address at 73 and 75 Lorong 14 Geylang, had been properly updated in the **_Online Foreign Worker Address Service_** (OFWAS), within five days of their move to the Geylang premises, which was also an infringement of the Employment of Foreign Manpower (Work Passes) Regulations 2012 (EFMR). OFWAS is an online system that captures the residential addresses of all Work Permit holders (excluding domestic maids), to assisting MOM in the overall management of foreign manpower in Singapore, allowing for MOM to reach out directly and expeditiously to foreign employees in emergencies. Mr Shi in his capacity as the director of Genocean Enterprises, was deemed to have consented to Genocean Enterprises’ failure to update OFWAS.

### Facts relating to MAC Nos. 903960 to 903963 of 2017 (Unacceptable Accommodation Charges at 682 Geylang Road)

18     Genocean director Shi faced a **_second_** set of unacceptable accommodation charges in respect of another property. On 22 August 2016, URA conducted an inspection at an address at #02-01 at 682 Geylang Road. The private residential premises had been rented by Genocean Enterprises on a one-year lease commencing from 1 July 2016. Investigations revealed that between 1 July 2016 to 22 August 2016, Genocean Enterprises and another Genocean company; Genocean Construction Pte Ltd, had housed some 15 individuals in residential premises allowed to accommodate no more than eight persons.

### Facts relating to MAC Nos. 903975, 903976, 903979 and 903980 of 2017 (Furnishing false information in OFWAS for workers at 682 Geylang Road

19     Mr Shi next faced four further charges arising from the discovery of the workers at 682 Geylang Road, when investigation uncovered that their declared addresses had been falsified. Mr Shi was deemed to have consented to the companies furnishing false information to the Controller of Work Passes. These investigations revealed that Mr Shi had been under the impression that the address at 682 Geylang Road had been blocked by MOM, and had this instructed a staff member; Mr Cao Jing, to declare their previous address, rather than the address at 682 Geylang Road. The provision of false information was to ensure that work permits would be issued.

### Ex-tempore sentencing remarks

20     The following are my _ex-tempore_ sentencing remarks before I passed sentences against the company and its two directors:

> 12.    This case involves rather egregious circumstances, where the number of workers 66[^9] and 15 persons[^10] residing at the implicated premises respectively, where the premises were allowed to hold just 8 individuals each. The scene photographs do indeed depict workers living in cluttered, cramped and rather squalid conditions, with workers apparently drying their laundry within their rooms.

> 13.    The occupation of overcrowded and cluttered facilities would lead to attendant hazards including fire safety and electrocution risks. I have noted the presence of electrical plugs and wirings around and on the bedframes.

> 14.    Past cases have also demonstrated all too starkly the risks posed to the workers in the event of a fire. It would be difficult to envisage 66 workers being able to evacuate safely through the clutter and potential obstructions caused by accumulated belongings of these worker. One previous case resulted in four fatalities when a fire broke out in cluttered and cramped premises.

> 15.    I have noted the mitigation plea and note that the periods of offending or the unacceptable accommodation offences (March-April 2015, and July-August 2016) were fairly short at under two months. Of course, this might well be as a result of effective policing and co-ordination by URA and MOM inspectors.

> 16.    In sentencing, I am mindful of the fact that foreign workers have no discretion to dwell in premises of their own choosing but are utterly dependent on their employers to meet their accommodation needs. Appropriate deterrent sentences should therefore be imposed where employers fall short in providing workers with suitable and safe premises for their workers to rest after a long day of labour on their behalf.

### Sentences imposed against the directors and company

21     Mr Shi was sentenced for the 23 proceeded MOM charges, and agreed to 84 TIC charges, and was given an aggregate fine of $122 000 for the MOM charges. In addition, I imposed a fine of **_$15 000_** for the offence contrary to section 12(1) of the Planning Act. The URA prosecutor had proposed a fine of $30 000, while defence counsel had proposed $10 000. The specifics are set out below:

### Prosecution’s sentencing submissions

24     URA prosecutor Yvonne Tai justified their position for deterrent fines of $100 000 against Genocean Enterprises and $30 000 and $20 000 against Mr Shi and Mr Chen respectively as a necessary response for the general deterrence of ‘_property owners, tenants and employers seeking to profit at the expense of the health and safety of foreign workers, as well as the living environment of the surrounding community, through converting residential properties into illegal dormitories_’, and also reiterated her view that the accused company and directors should also receive specific deterrence[^11]. The prosecutor indicated that there should be _‘strong public policy reasons for adopting an uncompromising stance’[^12]_ as foreign workers, while an integral in Singapore’s economy remained ‘_a ‘vulnerable group_’ who with paltry bargaining power in respect of their conditions of housing. These are principles I agreed with and had alluded to like considerations in my _ex-tempore_ grounds.

25     In submissions which seemed to be somewhat at odds, the prosecutor also submitted that _‘(t)hese illegal dormitories cab cause serious dis-amenities to neighbouring residential or business estates’_[^13] and that _‘it is difficult to detect such offences’[^14]_, suggesting implausibly that the residents of the neighbourhood estates would acquiesce to, or silently countenance, the ‘**_serious dis-amenities’_** posited, without taking recourse measures, such as complaints to appropriate regulatory authorities.

26     The prosecutor also stated that offences relating to the construction of illegal dormitories had been committed to afford substantial financial gain. Unscrupulous employers would profit _by ‘cramming as many of their workers into a single residential property so as to save money’[^15]_. The prosecutor also highlighted data[^16] showing increased incidence of unauthorised dormitory cases, rising from 2500 cases in 2014 to 2800 in 2017. It should be noted, however, that such cases had **_declined_** as a **_percentage_** of URA’s enforcement caseload from a high point of 57.7 percent in 2015 to 35.7 percent in 2017. URA prosecutor Tai also reiterated that changes[^17] to the Planning Act, which came into force in May 2017 to allow for custodial terms to be imposed in unauthorised worker’s dormitory cases represented a _‘strong indication of Parliament’s intention to treat such offences more seriously’_. Ms Tai indicated that this stance could be seen in the tightening of the definition for premises to be deemed to be dormitory in the latest reforms, with residential premises restricted to just 6 occupants to not be deemed to be a worker’s dormitory.

27     To be clear, I would be in **_general agreement_** with the proposition expressed above, that there would be a need to deal decisively with individuals and entities involved in emplacing workers in unauthorised dormitories. My principal **_reservation_** would be that the sentences proposed by the URA prosecutor would not be just and proportionate in the particular factual circumstances of the instant case before me, particularly in the background of the MOM charges in the same proceedings, where the directors had already faced multiple fines for ‘_unacceptable accommodation’_ charges premised on the same yardstick to found liability, with significantly similar parallels in the respective Statements of Facts for MOM and URA.

### Proposed sentencing framework by URA for Planning Act ‘change of use’ offences

28     The URA prosecution mooted the establishment of a sentencing framework for Planning Act offences involving authorised changes of use. Ms Tai noted that despite the penalty provided in the Planning Act having been increased _‘around 66 times’[^18]_ in 1998 to from $3000 to $200 000[^19]. Despite this, she lamented that the sentencing precedents post-amendment had ‘failed to apply the legislative intent to substantially enhance sentences’ with the fines imposed tending to ‘cluster in the $5000-$6000 region’ amounting to ‘_less than 5% of the maximum fine’[^20]_. For ease of reference the unauthorised dormitory cases where the sentence which were asserted to be inadequate are set out below[^21]:

29     The learned prosecutor accordingly proposed that the court adopt a harm-culpability sentencing matrix for such Planning Act offences to allow for the application of full-spectrum sentencing for a full spread of the $200 000 maximum penalty. The URA matrix recommends as follows[^26]:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="0"><colgroup><col width="28.94%"> <col width="23.12%"> <col width="26.48%"> <col width="21.46%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><em>Culpability</em></b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><em>(horizontal axis)</em></b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">↔</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><em>Harm</em></b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><em>(vertical axis) </em></b><b>↨</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Low</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Medium</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">High</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Low (<b><em>slight</em></b>)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$5 000-$10 000</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">At least $30 000</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">At least $60 000</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Medium(<b><em>moderate</em></b>)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">At least $30 000</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">At least $60 000</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">At least $90 000</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">High (<b><em>severe)</em></b></p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">At least $60 000</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">At least $90 000</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">At least $130 000</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

30     Within this proposed matrix, the URA prosecution suggested[^27] that **_harm_** should encompass three categories; namely ‘low’, ‘medium’ and ‘high’ harm. I should add that URA’s proposed matrix has two deviations from the normal usages for such indices. The axes are inverted[^28] for this table as the harm index is usually in the horizontal axis and the culpability index should be in the vertical axis. There is also a divergence from the normally used nomenclature. Within the modified vertical axis of the harm/ culpability index, harm is **_usually_** expressed as **_slight_**, **_moderate_** or **_severe_** rather than categorisations of low, medium or high, which are generally reserved for culpability.

31     Drafted in the typical manner for such indices, the matrix should take this form[^29]:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="0"><colgroup><col width="19.8639727945589%"> <col width="23.9447889577916%"> <col width="26.5453090618124%"> <col width="29.6459291858372%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Harm↔/</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Culpability↨</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Slight</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Moderate</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Severe</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Low</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$5 000-$10 000</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>At least $30 000</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">At least $60 000</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Medium</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">At least $30 000</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>At least $60 000</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">At least $90 000</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">High</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">At least $60 000</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>At least $90 000</b></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">At least $130 000</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

32     URA pegged their categories were pegged in the following manner:

> (i)     ‘Low’[^30] harm would be for cases involving technical breaches and minor unauthorised structures in private homes;

> (ii)     Medium[^31] harm would ‘_involve_ **_unauthorised use of premises as a worker’s dormitory_** _and unauthorised erection of large structures/earthworks’_. \[Emphasis in the original\]; and

> (iii)     High[^32] harm would involve carrying out works within a conservation area, which causes irreparable damage or harm to a conservation building, or which adversely and materially affect the appearance or character of a conservation building and/or the area within which the conservation building is located.

33     The assessment of **_culpability_**, the prosecutor proposed, would be predicated on[^33]:

> (a)     the _mens rea_ of the offender, including whether the offence was deliberately committed or arose from negligence;

> (b)     the level of planning and sophistication of the scheme;

> (c)     deliberate steps taken to increase bed spaces (including the erection of partitions);

> (d)     steps taken to avoid detection or prosecution;

> (e)     whether offence was committed for financial gain; and,

> (f)     the length of offending behaviour.

### Submission of ‘medium’ harm and high culpability against all three accused

34     URA prosecutor Ms Tai sought set the level of harm for all unauthorised changes of use to worker’s dormitories at **_‘medium’_** (or moderate). To say the least, I was not at all convinced that there should be an invariable ‘automatic’ tagging of medium harm for **_all_** such cases, as there could be a very considerable degree of **_variance_** in the **_potential harm_** caused in different factual permutations, This point will be elaborated on further, where I will juxtapose a recently concluded case where four fatalities occurred in premises which had seen extensive modifications when a fire broke out in an improvised dormitory. This sand in stark contrast with the aforementioned **_four_** separate URA prosecutions in 2013 where between 11-20 workers were found in residences (typically terraced and semi-detached dwellings) converted into unauthorised dormitories, and fines of $5000-$6000 were imposed for these instance of illicit change of use. It might be expected that harm would be perceived as **_severe_** or ‘high’ in the former, and slight or ‘low’ in the latter four cases.

35     The notion of category-based wholesale pegging of a fine at a predetermined level (as in assigning a generic label of ‘medium’ or moderate harm for **_all_** cases involving unauthorised dormitories) **_without_** a nuanced and objective consideration of the actual facts of each case, was discouraged by See Kee Oon J in _Public Prosecutor v_ _Project Lifestyle Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 251</span>, where See J had held:

> 14    I should make it clear that I am not inclined to peg the fine at $50,000 as suggested, given that there were neither structural or physical alterations or damage, nor any change in appearance to the conserved building itself. In such instances, a fine of $50,000 might well be an appropriate starting point for consideration, and may require upward adjustment taking into account other relevant considerations such as evidence of unlawful activities (such as gaming, vice or drug-related activities) taking place on the premises**_. In the present case, no evidence was put forth of any such activities, let alone any complaints of noise pollution or of drunken, disorderly or unruly behaviour_**. \[Emphasis added\]

36     In _Project Lifestyle_, the respondent had operated _Witbier Café_ at 32 Kandahar Street, within the Kampong Glam conservation area, and had been charged with an offence under s 12(2) punishable under s 12(4) of the Planning Act. The offence involved a material change of use of the premises from a restaurant to a bar (which also served food) without conservation permission, amounting to a ‘development’ within the meaning of s 3(1) of the Act. The prosecution has appealed against the sentence of a $20,000 fine. The **_harm_** factors raised by the prosecution included ‘_the potential impact of the Respondent’s unapproved use on cultural sensitivities’_, presumably in view of the religious observances and ethnic practices of residents and persons frequenting the area. It should be noted too that the highlighted factors which were considered salient, in the quote above, are **_harm_** rather than **_culpability_** factors (since the respondent cannot be liable for the actions of third parties causing noise pollution or exhibiting drunken, disorderly or unruly behaviour, or indeed other situations that may not be within the respondent’s control.

37     The judgment in _Project Lifestyle_ documents the making of submissions to enhance sentences in an exponential manner, to reflect the augmentation of the maximum sentence permissible by law to $20 000 in 1998. The prosecution had urged the court there (and incidentally here) to give effect to this change. The doctrine of sentencing on a spectrum to reflect the penalty provided by law is an extremely well-established principle[^34]. Nevertheless; in allowing an uplift of the fine to $35 000, See Kee Oon J had also cautioned against an overly mechanistic application of the maximum penalty to derive the appropriate tariff for a fine. At \[5\]- \[6\] of _Project Lifestyle_, See J holds:

> 5    I turn next to outline some observations in relation to the prosecution’s submissions below and on appeal seeking a fine of $50,000. This is equivalent to the fine imposed in _Public Prosecutor v CGH Development Pte Ltd_ (UDC 01/2008, unreported) where substantial structural changes were made to a building located outside a conservation area. Various submissions were raised pertaining to the aggravating features to support a higher fine in the present case. **_But there are no relevant sentencing precedents involving similar factual scenarios to guide the court, and no systematic or objective method of computation that would lead one to arrive at the figure of $50,000._**

> 6    I begin with the premise that a $20,000 fine is hardly trifling. On appeal, it must be shown that this was a manifestly inadequate sentence and that the District Judge was plainly wrong or had acted on the wrong principles. **_It is not sufficient of course to merely point to the fact that a $20,000 fine amounts to one-tenth of the maximum permissible fine of $200,000. By analogy, if a jail term of 2 years is imposed for an offence of criminal breach of trust by public servant or banker which can attract life imprisonment, it does not ineluctably mean that the 2-year sentence is manifestly inadequate_**.

38     Ultimately, the countervailing sentencing considerations may make any attempt to peg sentences to fall within a monolithic stereotypical band of generic case-types (as in an omnibus categorisation of ‘medium’ or moderate harm for ‘_unauthorised dormitory’_ cases within the universe of Planning Act offences) extremely difficult. Even if there is a discernible concentration of such cases in a certain case type which will fall within a certain pattern of offending, there would likely still be ‘**_outliers_**’ in each case type. Also the sheer number of possible permutations and variations in the factual matrix would make stark categorisations within a discrete sentencing band extremely challenging.

39     Such an exceptional ‘**_outlier_**’ case was _Public Prosecutor v Development 26 Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 1 SLR 309</span>_._ In _Development 26_, the district court’s sentence of $6000 was allowed to stand. notwithstanding that the offence entailed the wholesale demolition of a conserved building. The appellate judge has clarified that this result was occasioned from certain peculiar facts and paucity of cogent submissions and should not be taken to represent any _ratio decidendi_ that an offence of this nature would not ordinarily attract a fine of more than $6,000.

### Limited utility of matrix in view of amendments to include custodial penalty

40     While the URA prosecutor had sought to establish the described framework as a panacea to the expressed concern that ‘_the sentences imposed in previous cases are far too low[^35] having regard to the legislative intent being the enactment and amendments to s 12 of the_ (Planning Act)’, I was of the view that the utility of the matrix, in its present form, may be limited given the latest set of Planning Act amendments to allow for the imposition of the **_enhanced_** penalty of a custodial term on May 2017. This would have constituted a major change to both the nature and extent of sentencing options for establishing illicit worker dormitories, and by that token, leave the proposed framework described above, to be directly applicable to cases which were predicated on infringements **_before_** 15 May 2017. I did not see any indication within the submissions tendered to suggest that many such cases remained unadjudicated and unsentenced in mid-2019.

41     The imposition of a custodial term as a potential penalty for post-May 2017 offences would doubtlessly very potent ‘game-changing’ sanction. A term of imprisonment would doubtlessly have a salutary effect as the ultimate deterrent, as this would be visited **_personally_** on officers of the company, where the deterrent effect of fine of whatever magnitude could be largely ameliorated, if not totally negated, by any implicit arrangement for the company to bear the quantum of the fine imposed on the implicated director’s behalf.

42     URA Prosecutor Ms Tai submitted that ‘_While this new provision was not operative at the time of the offences, it is a strong indication of parliament’s intention[^36] to treat such offences more seriously, and stronger deterrent sentences ought to be imposed for offences involving illegal workers’ dormitory’_. Notably, Minister for National Development; Mr Lawrence Wong, had indicated at the Second Reading of the Bill that ‘_The current level of fines is too low to serve as a strong deterrent against unlawful activity or conduct_**_._**_’_ The fact of the quantum of fines **_not_** being increased[^37], notwithstanding this observation, and the legislative enhancement entailing just the imposition of custodial sentences would, in my view, signal an intent to use the spectre of imprisonment as the **_ultimate_** sanction to effectively deter activities of this nature. There has therefore been a veritable sea-change in modalities for procuring deterrence, and thus the prosecution’s submissions for _‘stronger deterrent sentences’_ based on the pre-May 2017 ‘fines-only’ regime would carry limited force or significance in the holistic consideration of effective deterrence in sentencing present-day cases, where a lengthy term of imprisonment for errant officers has been added to the topmost tier within the _armamentarium_ of possible penalties.

43     Ultimately it should be recognised that, along with the perceived inefficacy of fines as ‘strong deterrent’ averred to in the Parliamentary speech above, fines can be inexact and blunt instruments. This is especially so if the **_dominant metric_** used (as appears to be the case here) is the number of workers found in the premises, without sufficient _nuanced_ consideration of the surrounding circumstances attending to the offending conduct. The repercussions resulting from a fine can vary enormously depending on the situation of the offending company and its officers. For a multinational corporation with deep pockets, a fine bordering on the $200 000 maximum can simply be shrugged off as bearing the ‘cost of doing business’. For small or medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), a large fine can exert a ruinous impact on their cash-flow, potentially leading to a downward economic spiral. This could culminate, in the worst case, in the insolvency of the company, with resultant collateral loss of employment of its officers, and of course, its workers. Where the new regime provides for a custodial penalty against the offending company’s officers, the spectre of an imprisonment term will be a beneficial effect of imbuing, in the ‘directing minds’ of the company, the very real personal **_penal_** consequences that they will **_individually_** pay, to effectively dissuade them from entertaining notions of embarking in this course of offending conduct.

### Further sentencing submissions

44     Other than the inadequacy of the penalties in preceding unauthorised dormitory under section 12 of the Planning Act, where penalties of $5000-$6000 had been imposed, and which the URA prosecutor had deemed to be ‘well under’ the maximum $200 000 fine, Ms Tai indicated that the TIC charges had been for similar offences, and the offence in relation to 682 Geylang had involved a conserved building. The URA prosecutor had emphasized that the difference in magnitude where 116 beds had been found, and after submissions on _mens rea_, projected savings from standard dormitory rates, and of steps taken to perpetrate the offence, expressed a view that the offending conduct merited an assessment of ‘_medium_ harm and high culpability’, and making a recommendation for Genocean Enterprises, Mr Shi and Mr Chen to receive respective fines of $100 000, $30 000 and $20 000. The differentiation for Mr Chen’s recommended fine being a third lower than Shi’s was premised on his ‘_having one less charge as compared to Shi Baoyi[^38]_’.

### Discovery of 116 beds does not automatically translate to proof that premises housed 116 occupants

45     In their submissions, the prosecution has made references to sentencing to be indexed to the 116 beds found in the premises, as if the beds found would ineluctably translate to proof of there being 116 occupants in the unauthorised dormitory. Ms Tai states[^39]:

> They were aware of the planning guidelines, but nevertheless, they proceeded to house up to 116 worker …workers in the premises.

46     I should make clear my reservations for the notion that the discovery of 116 beds must translate to a practical equivalency, much less a determined fact, that there were 116 workers habitually occupying the premises. in the absence of any other evidence proffered to establish this to actually be the case. While there have been images taken of the scene accompanying the statements of facts for both MOM and URA[^40], these image exhibits do not purport to show that **_all_** 116 beds were, in fact, occupied. While there have been agglomerations of personal items found alongside some of the beds depicted, there had been no exhibited inventory of items found on, or around, each and every bed to suggest its routine occupancy.

47     Given this, the presence of the additional beds would, at best, stand as circumstantial evidence of occupation being **_possibly_** higher than the count of 66 workers **_physically_** found on the premises at the night of the raid. There is no specific admission[^41] that 116 workers were actually housed there, but merely the eminently logical mathematical conclusion that 116 beds were **_capable_** of housing 116 individuals. Absent any provision of the Planning Act, or other salient legislation, mandating a reversal of the burden of proof to give respondents the _onus_ to disprove that artefactual evidence such as the number of beds found, to be presumptive of the number of actual occupants in unauthorised dormitories, I found it only correct to base my considerations of sentence to the indisputable fact of there being **_66_** workers discovered, and in apparent residence, at the scene.

48     In this regard, I noted that 13 April 2015 was a Monday. The raid had occurred in the night at, or around, 10 pm. It would be rather unlikely for workers on a workday night to be anywhere other than their ‘dormitory’ at the time. There is also no indication that either the workers or officers of Genocean Enterprises being aware of any impending raid before it occurred. Hence, I would be of the view that, while the actual number of occupants was never established, these 66 workers comprised the most reliably **_proximate_** count of the number of persons in habitual overnight residence at the material time.

### Defence submissions

49     Defence counsel emphasized that Genocean Enterprises, Mr Shi and Mr Chen had clean criminal records, and that Genocean’s employees had all been legally employed and possessed valid work permits at the material time. He added that the premises had been rented from a third party and that the accused entity and officers had merely ‘_shifted the various fittings around, they did not carry out ant significant works in the premises_’ nor ‘_modify or carry out any actual development addition and /or alteration works on the Premises._’[^42] Defence counsel also emphasized that the premises were air-conditioned and facilities for cooking and laundry were provided. Genocean Enterprises had also arranged for cleaners to come in and clear the place regularly.

### Submissions on proceedings taken concurrently against the Genocean Enterprises and its two principal officers

50     Defence counsel strenuously objected to the prosecution’s sentencing recommendation of a $100 000 fine for Genocean Enterprises on the basis that the two directors; Mr Shi and Mr Chen would also be visited with substantial fines. Referencing two cases: _Project lifestyle Pte Ltd_ and _PP v CGH Development Pte Ltd_[^43]where high fines of $35 000[^44] and CGH Development were imposed for s 12(1) Planning Act offences, defence counsel proposed a $20 000 fine as an appropriate penalty, to prevent an unfair result which they had rather colloquially referred to as a **_‘triple whammy’_** stating in the following empathic terms[^45]:

> 11.    While a company is a legal entity, it still has to act through human agents. We would firstly highlight that in the above two cases, only the company was charged for the offences. In this present case, in a ‘triple whammy’, the accused (body corporate and both directors) are ALL charged for exactly the same offence without any clear distinction made for the different roles or culpability each entity might have played. Also the respective directors are also charged by MOM (one charge for EACH worker) for providing ‘unacceptable accommodation’ in respect of workers staying in the same premises. We urge the court to consider the doctrine of proportionality when calibrating the individual and (global) sentences.

### Concern of potential for ‘double jeopardy’ in punishment on basis of similar facts in the MOM and URA prosecutions against the two directors

51     In respect of the URA’s sentencing recommendations against the directors, defence counsel underscored the fact that as Mr Shi and Mr Chen were also being charged by MOM for providing ‘unacceptable accommodation’ to the workers found at the premises, that there was a _‘clear overlap in the facts in both prosecutions’_, and urged the court to be mindful of the risk of _‘imposing double punishment in respect of the same set of facts/ aggravating factors._’[^46] I was of the view that this view was not without validity, with the risk being evident in the manner the Statement of Facts had gone to considerable detail[^47] on the conditions and perceived hazards at and around the premises. This would be within the context of a concurrent prosecution where the directors would be punished for providing ‘_unacceptable accommodation’_ to the workers. As mentioned above, both MOM and URA relied on the same provision to found liability.

### General consistency in sentencing

52     The court has a duty to ensure reasonable consistency in sentencing between ‘persons charged with similar offences arising out of unrelated events.’[^48] Sundaresh Menon CJ had articulated this principle in the following manner in _Chong Han Rui v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 25</span> at \[1\]

> Consistency in sentencing is a key principle in our criminal justice system. This is rooted in the notion that all are equal before the law…

53     Earlier, in _Lim Poh Tee v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] SGHC 26</span>, at \[30\], Yong Pung How CJ identified consistency in sentencing as ‘_a desirable goal’_ but cautioned against an inflexible or unthinking application of preceding cases as ‘_the ‘different degrees of culpability and the unique circumstances of each case’_ might play _‘an equally, if not more, important role_.’

54     This being the case, I was of the view that it was incumbent for the court, in deliberating an appropriate sentence in any particular, to have regard to sentences imposed in recent cases involving the same statutory regime and where there are relevant parallels in factual matrices, to better understand the context and basis for the sentence imposed in these other cases, to formulate a consistent sentence in the instant case. A recent case involved four fatalities in premises set up as an unauthorised dormitory where 22 workers were found to have resided at the material time.

55     The circumstances (which will be examined further in these grounds) showed the fatalities to be very egregiously linked to the manner the illicit dormitory was set up, contrary to the Planning Act. These considerations, in my view, weighed far more heavily than the fact that **_more_** (66 as against 22) workers had been found in the instant case. Upon a full consideration of all salient facts, I was convinced that it would not be appropriate to impose, against Genocean Enterprises, a fine which was higher than the highest fine of $60 000 imposed in that case.

### Analysing the recent case of Public Prosecutor v Chiang Teck Fung & ors

56     The case referred to is that of _Public Prosecutor v Chiang Teck Fung, Khah Tee Meng and Ong Kah Sum_ (URA Summons 3-5 of 2015/ SCDF Summons 19-21 of 2015)[^49]. Chiang Teck Fung was a landlord, who had worked with two of his tenants _Khah Tee Meng and Ong Kah Sum_, put up partitions in a private residential apartment for the purpose of creating an illicit dormitory that housed 22 foreign workers at the material time. The work had included a reconfiguration of the premises, which included converting the original five rooms into ten.

57     The case differs from the instant case by the fact that a cataclysmic event did occur in the early hours of Dec 6 in 2014, when an electrical fire gutted the ground floor of the three-storey Geylang shophouse, killing four Malaysian workers[^50]. They had been staying in one of the rooms and died of smoke inhalation.

58     After an eight-day trial in the State Courts, all three were each convicted on one charge under the Fire Safety Act, and one charge each under section 12 (1) of Planning Act. On 18 February 2019, Mr Chiang, the owner of the apartment, was sentenced to 10 months’ imprisonment for the Fire Safety Act offence, and a **$50,000 fine** for the Planning Act offence. Mr Ong and Mr Khah each received 13-month imprisonment terms for the Fire Safety Act offence, **and fines of $60,000** for the Planning Act offence. In the course of the sentencing process, Defence counsel Desmond Tan had seen the significance of this case, and had applied for a deferment of the sentencing hearing to study the case, and prepare further sentencing submissions. The application was, of course, acceded to.

### Sequence of events preceding the fatal blaze

59     At the mention, counsel relied on extracted **_press reports_**[^51] to make detailed submissions on the proceeding against _Chiang Teck Fung and others_.[^52] These press reports in turn referred to court documents which showed a rather convoluted history of dealings between the three men. These dealings began in 2007, when Mr Ong began renting the apartment along Geylang Lorong 4 from Mr Chiang. Mr Ong would then sublet it to other tenants, who were mainly foreign workers. Mr Chiang was fully aware of Mr Ong’s activities, and the lease was renewed several times until May 2014. Over this seven-years association, Mr Chiang increased the monthly rent from $600 to $1,500.

60     Mr Ong had then asked to partition **_more_** rooms in the apartment to sustain his business and Chiang agreed. Mr Ong increased the number of rooms from five to nine. The accused did not apply for approval from the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) to put up the partitions, nor seek approval from URA to change the use of the apartment to that of a workers’ dormitory housing more than eight workers.

61     In early 2014, Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officers raided the premises and found two over-stayers. Mr Chiang had terminated Mr Ong’s lease, demanding he tear down the partitions as he feared that ICA would be conducting another check. Mr Ong had hired Mr Khah to reinstate the apartment to its original condition sometime in July 2014.

62     The matter took a peculiar turn the very next month, where in s stark reversal of their original plans, Mr Chiang and Mr Khah signed a two-year tenancy agreement, where **_Mr Khah_** had rented the apartment for $2,500 a month, which was more than four times the original rent, Mr Khah and Mr Ong entered into their own collateral arrangement, to undertake a business arrangement where Mr Ong would finance the costs of renting the apartment and renovation works, and source for tenants, and Mr Khah would perform housekeeping tasks, and receive a share of the profits.

63     During this time, Mr Khah reverted the premises for use as an illicit dormitory, broadly following Mr Ong’s previous layout and putting up partitions again, except that the total number of rooms was now partitioned to 10, an addition of one over the previous nine rooms. At the material time, the rooms housed 22 foreign workers, from various countries including Bangladesh, China and Malaysia. Two Singaporeans also resided at the premises, each occupying one room.

### Cause and effects of fire

64     On Dec 6 in 2014, a fire broke out in the apartment, claiming the lives of four workers. Five other residents of the rooms were injures, with two SCDF firefighters also sustaining injuries. The SCDF fire investigation established that the fire started “at the electrical source at the fluorescent lighting” outside one of the rooms. Three employers who housed their workers in the apartment were fined a total of S$153,000 in separate proceedings and barred from hiring foreign workers.

65     The reportage included an article by _Today Online_ which covered prosecution’s submissions on their subtitle ‘_Sole Motive was to ‘Maximise Profit’_, and stated as follows.

> **_The prosecution argued that even though the partitions did not directly cause the workers’ death, they “clearly contributed to it”._**

> (The Deputy Public Prosecutors) said: “**_The partitions erected narrowed the common corridor significantly and affected the means of escape and the effectiveness of fire-fighting efforts. Further, because the partitions were made of combustible material, they added fuel to the fire and also contributed to the build-up of smoke in the premises.”_**

> They highlighted that this was the first case of its kind where deaths had occurred in an illegal foreign workers’ dormitory. The three men’s “sole intention was to maximise profit” by creating more rooms to accommodate more foreign workers, they added. \[_Emphasis added_\]

### A juxtaposition of the factual matrices in Genocean Enterprises and Chiang Teck Fung & ors

66     The two Planning Act prosecutions were sentenced close in time to each other, with the sentences in _Chiang Teck Fung & ors_ being imposed on 18 February 2019, and the sentences in the instant case on 23 April 2019. In preparing these grounds, I had the opportunity to peruse the written submissions _in Chiang Teck Fung & ors_[^53]and found a high level of similarity[^54] in these submissions and the set served in the instant case. These same policy considerations for a review of the ‘current sentencing regime’ were set out, as was the same proposed harm-culpability sentencing framework, with harm being proposed in the ‘**_medium’_** band for cases involving ‘_unauthorised use of premises as a worker’s dormitory’_**[^55]**. The **_culpability_** for the three accused persons was proposed at the **_‘medium’_** level.

67     The similarities in sentencing submissions would demonstrate that similar considerations in both policy and principal should apply, and concomitantly fortify the case for ensuring consistency in sentencing between the two cases. In Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence for _Chiang Teck Fung & ors_, the prosecution had recommended on the basis of ‘medium harm and medium culpability’ that ‘_the starting point should be $60 000 in line with the framework…However the Prosecution recognises that Chiang is less culpable as compared to Khah ad Ong solely because he did not actively source for clients, while the other two did. In addition, Khah and Ong were the ones responsible for creating more bed spaced and erecting partitions to increase the number of rooms_’. The prosecution thus recommended that Mr Chiang receive a fine of ‘at least $50 000’, and Mr Khah and Mr Ong to be sentenced to a fine of ‘at least $60 000 each’, which were in fact the sentences ultimately imposed.

### The circumstances surrounding the four fire deaths, along with and injuries to firefighters and workers, in Chiang Teck Fung & ors would place the case in a higher level of both harm and culpability than the instant case

68     As alluded above, I was of the view that the dictates of consistency in sentence could not justify, where fines of $50 000-$60 000 were imposed to the three accused persons in _Ching Teck Fung & ors_, the fine of $100 000 proposed by the prosecution against Genocean Enterprises[^56]. The latter was based on the URA prosecutor’s proposed assessment of **_high culpability_** for Genocean Enterprises, as well as its two principal officers. The learned prosecutor explained her computation being by reference to the ‘medium harm-high culpability’ bands in the sentencing framework, which would yield a baseline fine quantum of $90 000[^57]. Adding certain aggravating factors, she recommended an uplift of $10 000, carrying the final recommended sentence for Genocean Enterprises to $100 000. For the two directors, despite their ‘**_high culpability_**’ assessment also being applied, against the standard ‘medium harm’ applicable for this category of case (i.e.: the setting up of illegal dormitories), the prosecution recommended sentences of $30 000 and $20 000 for Mr Shi and Mr Chen respectively[^58]. Pertinent issues in relation to these recommended sentences against the directors will be covered from \[84\]-\[97\] in these grounds.

69     I was of the view that circumstances in _Chiang Teck Fung & ors_ were far more egregious, in both the **_harm_** occasioned by the fact of the four fire-related deaths of the Malaysian workers ( not to mention the injuries to firefighters and surviving workers) and also in **_culpability_**, considering the conduct of _Chiang Teck Fung_ and his confederates, in undertaking the partitioning works to illegally house foreign workers despite having been caught, allowing a cluttered environment, and using combustible materials for the actual partitions.

### Harm resulting in death must be accorded due gravity

70     In my view, there is no **_weightier_** consequence than a death occurring as the result of, or contributed to, by an illegal act or omission. We are, as a country, fully responsible and accountable for the well-being of foreign workers. On the scale of adverse events that might befall our guest workers, a death must rank as the worst possible outcome. Any such death would not just be a profound and irreversible loss to the worker’s family, but also, if it was preventable or caused, or contributed to, by an illegal act or omission, put a degree of **_reputational risk_** that threatens the hard-earned image of our country as a safe and desirable place to work. One would thus expect the **_harm_** level to be securely within the severe (or ‘high’ in the URA framework) range.

### Egregious extent of culpability is clearly borne out from reportage supplied

71     The acts of Mr Chiang and his associates have eventuated in no fewer than **_four_** eminently preventable deaths. The deeply egregious culpability of the trio is borne out by the reportage in the three news articles produced prior to sentencing (and fortified by my subsequent reading of the prosecution’s submissions[^59]), where the DPPs in conduct have made it quite plain that even though the partitions erected by Mr Chiang’s confederates did not directly cause the workers’ death, they ‘clearly contributed to it’. This was based on the observation that the partitions had constricted the common corridor to such an extent as to affect the means of escape and the effectiveness of fire-fighting efforts. Further, the fact of the partitions being made of combustible material, added actual ‘fuel to the fire’ and contributed to the build-up of smoke in the premises[^60].

72     The sheer venality of the trio’s primary motive would add to the considerations of culpability, as the DPPs’ had stated that the three men’s ‘_sole intention was to maximise profit’_ by creating more rooms to accommodate more foreign workers. The **_unprecedented_** nature of the case was also clear from when the conducting DPPs ‘_highlighted that this was the first case of its kind[^61] where deaths had occurred in an illegal foreign workers’ dormitory_’[^62]. One would legitimately assume that an exemplary sentence would be applied for, and imposed, in an instance with such a dire and tragic factual presentation as this case. I would thus expect that the sentences of $50 000 against Mr Chiang and $60 000 against Mr Khah and Ong (to reflect their more active roles) to be sentences holding such exemplary value.

### The primary metric in the case against Genocean Entreprises seems primarily driven by the relatively high number of workers found in the premises

73     Given the above, I was surprised to learn that the learned URA prosecutor was seeking an even higher sentence of $100 000 against Genocean Enterprises. Four factors for cited to justify their basis for ‘high culpability’[^63], which were :

> (a)     perceived savings in rent,

> (b)     the fact of 66 foreign workers being found,

> (c)     active steps taken to increase bed-space by shifting furniture and using double decker beds; and

> (d)     period of offending of ‘about 3.5 months.’

### Significant difference in the ‘period of offending’ between URA’s submissions, and MOM ‘unacceptable accommodation’ charges and Statement of Facts

74     Turning first to factor (d), it would appear that the period of offending (ie use of premises residence as an illegal dormitory) was **_shorter_** in the instant case than in _Chiang Teck Fung & ors._ In the latter case, Mr Chiang had been a landlord at the premises and known Mr Ong since 2007. The scheme, which involved Mr Khah, had run its course from August 2014 to 6 December 2014, when the fire broke out. In the present case, the URA prosecutor has sought to assert that the ‘_period of offending was for about 3.5 months’_[^64]. This would, however, contradict the stipulated timeframes in the charges brought by MOM against the two officers of Genocean Enterprises; Shi Baoyi and Chen Ming. The seven charges[^65] proceeded against Mr Shi, and the eight charges[^66] brought against Mr Chen in respect of ‘_unacceptable accommodation’_ at Geylang Lorong 14 was for the period ‘between _March 2015 to April 2015’_.

75     MOM’s Statements of Facts for the two men also reference the offending period to be ‘_between March to April 2015’._ While the URA Statement of Facts specified the existence of a **_tenancy agreement_** to rent the premises commencing from January 2015, there are no admissions that the offending conduct of making a material change to the use of the premises at Lorong 14 Geylang occurred at this time, as the URA’s Statement of Facts never **_specifies_** any period where more than eight foreign workers commenced to take up residence at the property. The only pertinent reference point, and the only other date mentioned in the entire Statement of Facts, would be the date of the raid on 13 April 2015, when 66 workers were found. Hence, the only **_explicit_** time frame where the offence was unequivocally committed would be within the **_six-week_** period of the month of March and the first 13 days of April 2015. This period would be somewhat shorter than the four-month term of August 2014 to 7 December 2014 in _Chiang Teck Fung & ors_.

### The accused company and directors did not make any physical changes by way of fixtures or partitions to the premises.

76     The reason the commencement date of ‘change of use’ of the apartment could not be pinned down is in itself a significant differentiating factor from the situation in _Chiang Teck Fung & ors_. In the instant case, it was difficult to mark the exact time the premises started to operate as an illicit dormitory (other than the establishment of the March-April 2015 timeframe by admission), as there was **_no modification_** of the physical structure of the premises, unlike the partitioning and subdivision of the premises in the other case, As the URA statement of Facts states:

> Shi Baoyi admitted that while they did not make any alteration to the structure or layout of the Premises, they had shifted in the furniture beds and mattresses found at the Premises.

77     In _Chiang Teck Fung & ors_, it had been the physical modifications which had caused the most serious problems of congestion and clutter when the fire broke out. While I had averred to the difficulty of evacuating from overcrowded premises if a fire were to break out in my _ex-tempore_ grounds, this would have been a considerably smaller problem than the case in _Chiang Teck Fung & ors_, which and fixtures and partitions were made from flammable material, which had contributed to the deaths from smoke asphyxiation when an electrical fire broke out. It should therefore be clear that I view the measure of offending here to be smaller in scale, with the congestion by the close placement of beds and tangle of wired appliances being merely possible **_risk factors_** in the event of a fire. Of course, these beds are movable and can be **_shifted_** in the event of a fire, albeit conceivably occasioning some delay in evacuating the premises. This pales with the situation in _Chiang Teck Fung & ors_ where the immovable and combustible fixtures proved to be a veritable inextricable **_death-trap_** for the four hapless workers. In this regard, defence counsel pointed out that the partitioning from four or five room to ten rooms had narrowed the corridors in that case[^67]. The drywall material used has also been combustible, adding the danger in the event of a fire. In the instant case, counsel provided images to show that while there had been some clutter, the corridors at the Geylang premises were safe from a Fire Safety perspective[^68]. It should also be noted that before the fines of $50 000-$60 000 were imposed in _Chiang Teck Fung & co_, the highest section 12 (1) Planning Act fine of $50 000 had been imposed in a truly extreme case where three additional floors were built to a 10-floor building in the Killiney area, without authorisation.

### Insufficient contextual information to allow for exemplary sentencing

78     The principal difficulty I had in this case was that while the MOM was arguing for sentences for the ‘_unacceptable accommodation’_ charges[^69] which were within the usual range, and amply **_supported_** by their extensive sets of precedents[^70], the URA submissions sought to do the **_converse_**, by urging the court to **_depart_** from their own exhibited precedents for unauthorised dormitory cases (even when these concerned sentences which were imposed after the $200 000 maximum penalty had been in force, and the full spectrum sentencing doctrine enunciated in _Angliss_ had become a well-established tenet of law), on the various bases described above. While the URA prosecutor had asked the court to impose a sentence which was a quantum leap over and above previous sentences for the setting up of unauthorised dormitories contrary to the Planning act, there was insufficient **_contextual_** information to assist the court to come to a conclusion which aligned with their views.

79     The prosecution had urged exemplary sentences premised on (_inter alia)_ ‘_the need to send a signal to employers that they have a duty to ensure that their workers reside in proper accommodation…_’[^71]. The Statement of Facts has gone into considerable detail in relation to Genocean Enterprises ‘housing their workers in cramped and poor living conditions’ as justification for high culpability. There is however insufficient contextual information for the court to understand how the standards have objectively and measurably **_fallen short_** of conditions and amenities which would be available in **_authorised_** dormitories. The Statement of Facts points out that for the 66 workers found, the total area of the premises ‘_worked out to around_ **_4.5 square metres_** _per occupant’_, but neither the Statement of Affair nor the Prosecution’s Submissions specify if this fell short of any **_minimum standard_** for worker’ quarters[^72]. In a similar vein, the URA prosecutor had inveighed against the use of double-decker beds but did not clarify whether such beds are prohibited in authorised dormitories.

80     This is against a situation where the defence had submitted that ‘the workers staying in the Premises actually regarded the facilities and amenities provided as being good’[^73], and attached a statutory Declaration where Mr Xu Da, a worker residing there at the material time who says[^74]:

> 3.    I wish to state that the accommodation provided by the company at Lorong 14 Geylang was very good. Each of us had a bed and private space. The address was air-conditioned and there were proper facilities like cooking and laundry provided. The company also arranged for cleaners to come in and clear the place regularly.

> 4.    I understand that the company is being charged for providing acceptable accommodation. I do not understand thus as I believe that the accommodation provided is already very good compared to others I had previously stayed at. If the company has not treated its workers and me well, I would not have stayed wiith them for such a long time.

81     There have also been computations anchoring the prosecution’s characterization of Genocean Enterprise’s motive had been to effect cost-savings in the set of submissions. I could not agree with these quantifications. In the Submissions on Sentence, the URA prosecutor’s quantifications purport to show substantial savings of $27 230 to $84 980 (with the latter based on 116 workers residing in the illicit dormitory) were made without exhibiting the necessary substantiating documents to prove that the prevailing rate was indeed _‘$330 per bed space_’.[^75] Without extrinsic proof, the court is not in a position to take cognizance of any particular figure as the usual applicable fee (or within a range of charges deemed reasonable in that particular industry). It would have been beneficial to extend, to the court, quotations from authorised dormitories, or confirmation from an authoritative source; perhaps from Building Control Authority (BCA) or Singapore Contractor’s Association Limited (SCAL), that this was indeed the ‘going rate’.

82     Also, as I have indicated above, there is no strong evidential basis to support the contention that 116 workers occupied the premises, since 66 workers were found on a raid conducted late at night on a weekday. The Statement of Facts does contain a specific admission[^76] that the rental for the Geylang premises was $14 000 a month. Using the quoted (but not validated) _‘$330 per bed space’_ computation against the 66 persons found would yield a monthly fee of $21 780 chargeable at an authorised dormitory, which allows a surplus of $7 780 per month. This, however, does not factor-in the utility costs and other incidentals for the 66 individuals. These might be substantial as defence counsel has indicated that the premises were equipped with air-conditioning units, and suppled with washing machines. _Per_ the time frame specified in the MOM charges, the admitted use of the premises as an unauthorised dormitory was six weeks from March to 13 April 2015. For this period, this would yield a gross surplus sum of $11 760, **_without_** taking into consideration the utility bill expenditures and other incidental expenses for 66 people for one and-a-half months. Again, contextual information such as whether authorised dormitories would charge separately for cleaning, water, electricity and other utilities, or if this would be absorbed within the quoted $330 fee, would have been useful for an accurate and reliable computation of potential cost savings. Given the diminution of projected cost-savings above, it is somewhat less clear if the dominant motive in setting up the unauthorised dormitories was indeed to effect cost savings, or for some other undisclosed purpose expedient to Genocean Enterprises.

83     Given the above, the only remaining bases for imposing a sentence that was higher than the norm would be the point that both the company and the directors, while technically first offenders, faced TIC[^77] charges for similar offences, and also the fact of the very large number of workers found at the Geylang premises. Notwithstanding this I was of the view that the $100 000 fine proposed against Genocean Enterprises could not be justified. This being particularly so as; other than the higher number of workers found (66 as against 22), this case disclosed circumstances which were significantly less aggravated than the truly dire situation in _Chiang Teck Fung & ors_. I was of the view that a fine of $60 000 against Genocean Enterprises would be a just and proportionate sentence, as I was convinced that the quantum of the instant fine against Genocean Enterprises should not exceed the highest fine imposed in _Chiang Teck Fung & ors_..

### Discussion on basis of sentence against directors Shi and Chen

84     The learned URA prosecutor explained her basis for sentencing submissions for Mr Shi and Mr Chen in the following manner[^78]:

> Given that Shi Baoyi and Chen Ming were essentially the directing mind of Genocean and played active roles in housing the workers, they ought to ve punished as per the proposed framework. Although the prosecution is seeking a fine of at least $100 000 for Genocean, it would still be necessary to impose sufficiently high fines on Shi Baoyi and Chen Ming to serve the principle of deterrence in view of **_their level of culpability._** Hence the prosecution proposes that a fine of at least $30 000 and $20 000 for Shi Baoyi and Chen Ming respectively would be appropriate to a) deter them from committing similar offences in the future; and b) send a signal to employers that they have a duty to ensure that their workers reside in proper accommodation and they cannot absolve themselves of liability by hiding behind the corporate veil. The proposed fines also take into consideration that Shi Baoyi has one additional charge taken into consideration for sentencing as compared to Chen Mings position’. \[Emphasis added\]

A further elaboration was subsequently given for the basis of the URA prosecutor’s quantification of the measure of fines to be imposed[^79]:

> 8.    As for Chen Min and Shi Baoyi, the Prosecution has already taken into account that (Genocean Enterprises) has been charged in submitting for sentences of $20 000 and $30 000 respectively for these director’s Planning Act charges. **_This is evident from the fact that these sentences are respectively below and at the lowest end of the range for medium harm/low culpability under the Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework for offences for offences under section 12 (1) of the Planning Act._** Furthermore, we are given to understand that the sentences sought by MOM (for the unacceptable accommodation charges) fall within the usual tariffs. In the premises, there has clearly been no double counting in the sentencing positions submitted. \[Emphasis added\]

85     I would flag an anomaly in the prosecution’s initial position in their sentencing submissions that the two directors should be accorded ‘**_high culpability’_**[^80] (which carries an indicative sentence of fine of ‘at least $90 000’. In term of the actual tariff sought, however, the learned URA prosecutor had mooted a steep downward modification to the sentence band for **_low culpability_** (where the indicative range is ‘at least $30 000’). I would, with the greatest respect, wonder about the practical applicability of a proposed sentencing framework which would mandate a ‘teleportation’ or a drastic adjustment of the notional levels of culpability from ‘high’ to ‘low’ for use against different defendants (i.e.: the company on the one hand, and its two directors, on the other) in the same case, where their putative roles and criminal responsibility should be the same (the directors being effectively the _‘directing mind’_ of the company. Shi and Chen being reportedly the only directors of the company and handled all aspects of operations and decision-making[^81]), and where the parity principle[^82] would normally apply. This manoeuvre appeared to be intended to avoid propounding a massively disproportionate sentence of fines of ‘at least $90 000’ against all three accused.

86     To be clear, I would have **_ordinarily_** found the lowered quantum for the recommended fines of $30 000 for Mr Shi and $20 000 to not be unreasonable in the context of a prosecution where their company; Genocean Enterprises, has been concurrently prosecuted. One would naturally expect that the corporate entity would receive a heftier fine than individuals within the company, even if those individuals have been characterised to be the ‘directing minds’ of the company. My reservations are merely with a bloc categorisation of ‘high culpability’ of all three following the proposed criteria in the sentencing framework, only to have the drastic ‘downgrade’ to low culpability just to avoid a disproportionate cumulative sentence against the three charged for the URA offences. This particular situation also had the **_added_** complexion of the fact that the two directors faced multiple **_MOM_** charges as well. Hence, I was mindful of the need to also factor-in salient considerations of **_proportionality_** which were especially applicable in the instant facts.

### Considerations of proportionality where multiple sentences of fines are imposed

87     The starting point for my deliberation for the proposition of when proportionality should apply for multiple fine sentences would be from the commentary of the volume in _Sentencing Practice_[^83]

> If the offender is sentenced to a fine on more than one charge, the court must apply the totality principle and **_ensure that it is proportionate to the totality of the offending_** See _Chelmsford Crown Court ex parte Birchall_ (19890 11 Cr App R (S) 510. \[_Emphases added_\]

88     The universality of in the application of the proportionality and totality can be seen by the pronouncement of Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon in the case of _Gan Chai Bee Anne v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 42</span> (_Anne Gan_)[^84].

> 77    Next, in my judgment, in addition to complying with the one transaction rule and the totality principle as elaborated in Shouffee and Raveen**_, the way in which sentences are run should, as far as possible, reflect the substance and totality of the offending conduct_**. Where multiple offences are involved, the most appropriate mechanism for doing so is the consecutive running of multiple sentences. In my view, this is preferable to imposing what may, to the accused, be unexpectedly disproportionate individual sentences for relatively minor offences. \[Emphasis added\]

89     In assessing ‘_the substance and totality of the offending conduct_’, I considered that the ‘**_offending conduct’_** which is sought to be punished in this instance, would be, for both the URA charges appealed against and MOM _‘unacceptable accommodation’_ charges, the **_same_** course of activity of procuring the premises at Lorong 14 Geylang, and arranging for 66 individuals to be housed there, in contravention URA’s Development Control Guidelines. Both prosecutions arise from the same root criterion of any premises holding more than eight[^85] workers to be deemed to be a dormitory. It is of course the case that there is a degree of differentiation in the interests that MOM and URA were seeking to protect. MOM’s role was oriented toward the regulation and welfare of foreign manpower in ensuring that guest workers are housed in acceptably habitable accommodation, while URA’s remit was to prevent unauthorised changes of use, in this instance from a residential property to an illicit worker’s dormitory. Given the facts of this case however, there an inevitable **_intersection and permeability_** between the interests of the two agencies, which is evident in the learned URA prosecutor making repeated references to the observed conditions and fittings in the Geylang premises as she urged the court to _‘send a signal to employers that they have a duty to ensure that their workers reside in proper accommodation’_, there was the possibility of certain aggravating circumstances being either amplified from the concentration of successive submissions, or twice counted in sentencing. I was therefore mindful of the need to temper my overall sentence to ensure that there was no double-counting of aggravating features in the cumulative fines imposed from the single course of criminal conduct which was prosecuted by two different State agencies.

### Sentences of fines are always ‘consecutive’ in nature, and must be paid in full

90      _Anne Gan’s_ case differs from the instant case as that case involved a number of charges where short custodial terms were imposed, the pronouncement is nevertheless salient as it restates the fundamental tenet of sentencing practice to calibrate sentences into a global sentence to appropriately reflect the substance and totality of the offending conduct. Indeed, this considered adjustment should apply _a fortiori_ in the case of fines, as there is **_no concurrency_** in sentences comprised of a series of fines, as all fines imposed must be paid in **_full_**. In _Anne Gan_, a considered adjustment of multiple individual sentences to run consecutively achieved this goal.

91     The instant case is different, where involves a series of proceeded charges where the prescribed penalties are in the form of fines. The court’s duty must thus ensure that the **_global fine sentence_** satisfies the requirement of **_overall proportionality_**. Simply put, the only way to ‘_apply the totality principle and ensure that it is proportionate to the totality of the offending’_[^86] in the case of fines, is to adjust and make fine calibrations to the individual fines to a quantum which fulfils this objective.

92     In this regard, I noted that Mr Shi and Mr Chen had respectively seven and eight MOM ‘unacceptable accommodation charges. For these charges, the MOM prosecution had recommended fines of $7500 per charge. I was mindful that while Mr Chen faced just unacceptable accommodation charges, Mr Shi faced 23 MOM charges to accompany the single section 12 (1) Planning Act charge preferred by URA.

93     As mentioned above, there being no way for a fine sentence to run concurrently, each individual fine had to be paid in full. It was thus necessary to perform a downward ‘titration’ to fulfil the objective of imposing a proportional total sentence that bore a commensurate relationship with their nature and extent of their offending. For the collective 15 MOM ‘_unacceptable accommodation’_ charges, I imposed sentences of $6000, for a cumulative total of $42 000 and $48 000 for Mr Shi and Mr Chen respectively. For the s12 (1) Planning Act charges, I imposed respective fines of $15 000 and $12 000 against Mr Shi and Mr Chen.

94     To put the totality of the sentences in perspective, Mr Chen’s global sentence was $60 000, and Mr Shi’s was $137 000. Combined with the $60 000 fine imposed against Genocean Enterprises, the accumulated total fine was $257 000. I would be apropos too to contemplate if the sentences connected to the Geylang premises ‘_reflect the substance and totality of the offending conduct_’.

95     With this in mind, I considered the consolidated total for the ‘_unacceptable accommodation’_ charges along with the three Planning Act charges against the company and two directors. Hence, in terms of condign punishment, the penalties emanating from charges proceeded by the two agencies for their criminal acts of contracting and maintaining an illicit dormitory proven house to 66 workers in the raid on 13 April 2015, the fines imposed amounted to $57 000 for Mr Shi, $60 000 for Mr Chen and $60 000 for Genocean Enterprises, amounting in all to a grand total of **_$177 000_**.

96     In concluding, I would first state that the court acknowledges and commends URA and MOM for their efforts in the often arduous and challenging work of investigating and taking errant employers to task for the breaches of their respective regulatory regimes in controlling the use of premises as dormitories, and ensuring that foreign workers dwell in suitable accommodation, This court however, must also ensure that fines imposed were faithful to the applicable principles of **_totality_** and **_proportionality_**, and also fulfil the need for **_consistency_** in sentencing (when compared with the penalty imposed in _Chiang Teck Fung & ors_ and other Planning Act cases where relatively higher penalties were imposed).

97     Ultimately, I agree that the flagrant breaches of the law perpetrated by Genocean Enterprises and its two directors cannot be countenanced, and severe penalties must be imposed as a denunciation of their activities, and as an appropriate deterrent to other employers who may be tempted to follow in their ilk. Nevertheless, while the scale of offending of maintaining 66 workers in an illicit dormitory is troubling, the situation here pales in comparison to the catastrophic harm caused in terms of the grim human and reputational[^87] toll in _Chiang Teck Fung & ors_, or the grievous culpability in recklessly partitioning the rooms with combustible material and narrowing the corridors, arising from motives of expedience and venality, of the three principal figures.

98     I should add that I would have been inclined to consider a higher fine if _other_ aggravating factors, including those listed by the learned URA prosecution, had been present here. These might include dis-amenities and harassment caused by the illicitly housed workers to the neighbouring public, the presence of insects, rodents or other vermin in the premises, or the workers being housed in premises which were grossly below the minimum ‘per-worker’ space allowance in authorised dormitories.

99     In the instant case, no untoward event occurred, and no workers were documented as having suffered any injuries, illness[^88] or other privation from their residence in March to mid-April of 2015. The primary thrust for the sentences proposed was the singular fact that the Geylang Lorong 14, being residential premises, had become an unauthorised dormitory for the very large number of 66 persons, there had been no submission that the premises breached any minimum per-worker space requirement[^89] imposed by URA, or indeed other significant relevant factor adversely differentiating the conditions in the premises from **_authorised_** dormitories, other than the clutter and disarray around the beds.

100    The photographic images provided by the prosecuting agencies of the premises did show an unedifying sight of the tangle of electrical plugs and wirings around and on the bedframes, which might present fire safety and electrocution risks. Nevertheless, this situation should be seen in the context of Genocean Enterprises and its directors having done no retrofitting, and making minimal modifications other than shifting in beds, mattresses and furniture. The additions were thus objects of a readily movable nature. Hence while the clutter might hinder rapid evacuation in the event of a fire before they were shifted out of the way, there were no newly installed partitions or narrowed passageways cluttered with incendiary material which might have proven to be an insuperable obstacle to evacuation, as was the case in _Chiang Teck Fung & ors_.

### Instalment applications

101    Genocean Enterprises and the two directors did not have sufficient funds to pay the imposed global fine of $257 000 outright in a single tranche. Counsel asked for an instalment scheme. After I ascertained that both MOM and URA prosecutors had no objections to deferred fine payments, I allowed Genocean Enterprises to pay an initial tranche of $30 000, and the remainder of the $60 000 in three monthly instalments of $10 000. Mr Shi and Mr Chew also asked for and were allowed instalments over a term of three months to settle their respective fines of $137 00 and $60 000.

102    This final post-sentence chapter of this case, where the Genocean Enterprises and its directors requested in open court[^90] to pay their fine by instalments adds salience to my observation[^91] that the impact of a fine (and hence its concomitant deterrent effect) can vary enormously depending on the situation of the offending company and its officers, with SMEs more likely to suffer severe and immediate effects to their cash flow. Ultimately, I was of the view that a rigid application of a sentencing band principally considering only a monolithic metric of _‘number of workers found’_ in premises used as unauthorised dormitories, without a nuanced study of competing relevant considerations, might yield a disproportionately high global fine, with deleterious aftereffects to the defendant company, and implicated officers.

[^30]: Properly ‘slight’ harm.

[^31]: Properly ‘moderate’ harm.

[^32]: Properly ‘severe’ harm.

[^33]: Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence at \[40\].

[^34]: Per _Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] SGHC 155</span>, which holds at \[84\]:84     It is trite law that “the maximum sentence should be reserved for the worst type of cases falling within the prohibition”: see Sim Gek Yong at \[12\]– \[13\]. By imposing a sentence close to or fixed at the statutory maximum, a court calibrates the offender’s conduct as among the worst conceivable for that offence. In other words, when Parliament sets a statutory maximum, it signals the gravity with which the public, through Parliament, views that particular offence…

[^35]: The prosecution’s submissions do not seem to explain why **no: ** appeal was brought in these cases despite the apprehension that the sentences were inadequate and where the table identifies there being a considerable cluster of ‘unauthorised dormitory’ Planning Act prosecutions occurring in 2013. The maximum sentence of a $200 000 fine had been in place since 1998, and the cited pronouncements in _Angliss_ had been made in 2006.

[^36]: The salient passage in the Parliamentary proceedings on the Second Reading of the Planning (Amendment) Bill on 6 February 2017 documents the Minister for National Development stating: ‘There are also stricter penalties for unauthorised development or works because where violations are uncovered, the Bill puts in place a series of penalties for the offences under the Act. **The current level of fines is too low to serve as a strong deterrent against unlawful activity or conduct.: ** For example, URA has increasingly encountered unauthorised dormitories, including some repeat offenders. The penalties for demolishing a conserved building must also be enhanced as any unauthorised demolition will result in an irrevocable loss of our built heritage. **With that in mind, the Bill will put in place stricter penalties: **. **The maximum penalty: ** for unauthorised development, works or subdivision for repeat offenders or **for an offence involving the unauthorised use of any land or building for dormitory accommodation will be enhanced to include a custodial sentence: **. \[_Emphasis added_\]

[^37]: The maximum penalty for fines remains as ‘_a fine not exceeding $200,000_’.

[^47]: See \[4\]-\[5\] of the URA’s Combined Statement of Facts which references workers ‘staying in cramped and poor conditions’, erecting ;make shift clothing lines’, having ‘insufficient space; and living with ‘potential fire hazards’.

[^48]: While sharing certain parallels, the principle of consistency in sentencing is distinct from the related principle of parity in sentencing of co-accused persons engaged in the same offence or criminal enterprise. In _Public Prosecutor v Ng Sae Kiat and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 191</span>, Chao Hick Tin JA states: 76 The High Court of Australia’s decision in _Green v R_ (2011) 283 ALR 1 (“_Green_”) is instructive in explaining the scope of the parity principle. In that case, the court stated that there is a difference between the principle of parity in sentencing and **the general objective of “‘reasonable consistency’ in sentencing”. It stated that the latter concept applies as between “persons charged with similar offences arising out of unrelated events” whereas the former applies to the punishment of “co-offenders: **” … \[_Emphasis added_\]

[^49]: The case is under appeal by one of the three accused persons, and I am given to understand that the grounds of decision are being prepared.

[^50]: Messrs Jubitol Rumanjing, Ramu A/L Kotiah, Yusoff Bin Masrong, and Maslan Bin Musundo whose deaths were the subject of Coroner’s Inquiries: CI003922/003923/003924/003931-2014-OR, where findings were delivered on 6 August 2015.

[^51]: Annex A of **Further Submissions by Defence in Sentencing: ** included the following three news reports: (1) Today Online on 18 February 2019 (updated 19 February 2019) entitled **‘4 deaths in Geylang fire: Jail, fine for men who used apartment as illegal workers’ dormitory’.: ** (2) Channelnewsasia (CNA) article entitled ‘**Geylang fatal fire: Landlord, 2 others jailed for housing 22 foreign workers in shophouse’: ** dated 18 February 2019, and(3) The New Paper its 18 February 2018 edition entitled ‘**Jail, fine over fatal 2014 Geylang fire’.: **

[^52]: At the point of sentencing for _Genocean Enterprises_ and its officers on 23 April 2019, Defence counsel supplied the aforementioned **press reportage: ** for _Chiang Teck Fung & ors_, as these reports were the **only source documents: ** produced by the defence at the time. The URA prosecutor provided a _precis_ of the facts and prosecution’s submissions for _Chiang Teck Fung & ors_ at \[18\]- \[20\] pf the **Prosecution’s Reply Submissions to Defence’s Reply to Sentencing Submissions and Mitigation Plea: **. The prosecution also provided a juxtaposition of the instant case and _Chiang Teck Fung & ors_ at \[21\]-\[22\] of the submission. I am also aware of the Coroner’s Inquiry findings for Jubitol Rumanjing and the other three victims in the premises in question in _Chiang Teck Fung & ors_, by virtue of my being the State Coroner presiding over their cases, but I have no further comment from that source in these grounds, save that the Coroner’s Findings issued on 6 August 2015 for the four deaths **fully support: ** the prosecution’s characterisation of the extensive contributory role played by the three accused persons in creating a dangerous situation, which eventuated in the four fatalities.

My observations on the sentencing submissions of _Chiang Teck Fung & ors_ in \[66\] and \[67\], which were derived from my reading of the actual submissions **after: ** sentencing are **not intended: ** to form part of my grounds. The purpose of the juxtaposition of the submissions _in Chiang Teck Fung & ors_ (which were not available to me at the point of sentencing), and those in the instant case in \[66\] and \[67\] is simply to set out the presenting issues and compare salient factual parallels, and differences, to facilitate the appellate review of the instant case.

[^72]: In the course of preparation of these grounds, I had looked at extrinsic sources and noted the **URA’s Non-Residential Handbook: ** (February 2019 Ed) stating at page 113 ‘The maximum allowable number of workers in a dormitory is subject to **a living space standard of 4.5 sqm (min) per worke: **r and requirements of technical agencies such as LTA, PUB, SCDF, NEA, MOM and SPF’. I also noted a circular from the Singapore Contractor’s Association (SCAL) dated 27 November 2017 entitled **New Housing Standards for On-Site Workers’ Quarters: ** where a reference was made on the ‘minimum requirement **of ≥4.5 sqm of living space per worker: ** for on-site dormitories.’ These are, of course, extrinsic sources referred to after sentence was pronounced, and do not form part of my grounds. It would nevertheless have been useful to have had information of this nature placed before the court **before sentencing: ** for the court to make be properly informed on the very cogent point of whether the prosecution is asserting that Genocean Enterprise’s unauthorised dormitory had fallen short of minimum standards when the reference ‘**As around 66 workers … stayed in the Premises, this worked out to around 4.5 square meters of space per occupant.’: ** was made in the URA Statement of Facts.

The duration of offending for Lorong Kismis was 18 days with 44 workers found, and 1.7 months in 682 Geylang, with 15 workers found.

[^80]: This can be found at \[43\] of the Prosecutions Submission of Sentence

[^81]: The Statement of Facts at \[2\] states ‘_While Shi was mainly in charge of matters relating to the workers, Chen handled the administrative matters such as finance and contracts. That said, they would discuss and make decisions together_.’

[^82]: The Parity Principle was elucidated by CJ Yong in _Public Prosecutor v Ramlee and Anor_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR 539</span>: Where two or more offenders are to be sentenced for participation in the same offence, the sentences passed on them should be the same, unless there is a relevant difference in their responsibility for the offence or their personal circumstances…An offender who has received a sentence that is significantly more severe than has been imposed on his accomplice, and there being no reason for the differentiation, is a ground of appeal if the disparity is serious. This is even where the sentences viewed in isolation are not considered manifestly excessive…

[^83]: Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts Third Edition _Vol 1, page 49._

[^84]: While Anne _Gan’s_ case is more commonly quoted for Menon CJ’s elucidation of the proper approach for determining the aggregate sentence in cases involving multiple offences each of which, taken alone, may be a minor offence meriting only a light sentence, but when taken together, demonstrated a single course of criminal conduct, his honour’s analysis nevertheless concludes with the highlighted germane pronouncement on ensuring proportionality in deriving the final sentence:

[^85]: Since amended to the present limit of six workers.

[^86]: Referencing the reproduced passage in _Sentencing Practice_

[^87]: To both the industry and the State, especially where the deceased workers and injured were nationals from another country.

[^88]: Examples that might be referable to such breaches might include respiratory conditions from living in quarters with poor ventilation, musculoskeletal and spinal ailments from cramped surroundings or improper bedding, or skin conditions such as eczema or fungal infections from poor hygiene and sanitation.

[^89]: The reference in the Statement of Facts of the computation of the area of the premises being computable to a per-worker space of **4.5 square metres: **, for the 66 workers found remains somewhat cryptic, as there is no extrapolation or explanation of the implications of this computation in the Statement of Facts or subsequent sets of submissions.

[^90]: The application seems premised on a true necessity, as the case had received considerable media attention, and hence there might have been a consequential risk of an adverse impression on the Genocean Enterprise’s financial situation.

[^91]: At \[43\] of these grounds.
