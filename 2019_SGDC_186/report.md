\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9195/2019/01.\]

10 September 2019

### District Judge Edgar Foo:

## Introduction

1       The Accused, a 43-year-old Singaporean male, had pleaded guilty to 7 charge under section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241. Another 15 charges under the same section were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.

2       I imposed a sentence of 1 weeks’ imprisonment per charge and ordered 3 of the sentences to run consecutive giving a total sentence of 3 weeks’ imprisonment.

## Statement of Facts

5       The Accused admitted to the following Statement of Facts without qualification.

6       At the material time of the offences, the Accused was the sole proprietor of Lim Logistic Service and Trading (“LLS”).

7       On 10 January 2017, the CPIB received information that the Accused was engaging in a profit-sharing arrangement with one Ng Chee Kiong (also known as Terence) (“Ng”).

8       Investigation revealed that the Accused and Ng are cousins.

9       At the material time of the offences, Ng was a Senior Logistics Officer employed by Singapore Epson Industrial Pte Ltd (“SEP”). SEP is a subsidiary of a company, Seiko Epson Corporation in Japan, which is in the business of printing. The business of SEP is focused on manufacturing consumables for Seiko Epson Corporation. SEP also managed the warehouse operations of consumables and spare parts of another subsidiary of Seiko Epson Corporation, Epson Singapore Pte Ltd. As Senior Logistics Officer of SEP, Ng was responsible for operations of the SEP warehouse, as well as supervising SEP’s external contractors.

10     LLS provided labelling, rework and disposal services to SEP. The labelling rework jobs involved pasting product information stickers on the manufactured Epson products, while the reworking jobs involved including additional information or translation of information to local languages. Disposal services were for disposal of consumables and inks in accordance with environmental and safety guidelines. Ng had recommended LLS to his superior for inclusion as one of SEP’s approved vendors without first comparing LLS’ prices to that of two other vendors.

11     Ng proposed to the Accused that the Accused give him S$50 to S$100 a month to reward him for his help in referring contracts from SEP to LLS, and the Accused agreed to do so.

12     The Accused knew that what Ng had done was improper. Ng had breached SEP’s standard operating procedure by failing to declare that LLS was owned by his relative, when he submitted a recommendation to his superior to include LLS in SEP’s approved vendor list. Had Ng’s superior been duly informed, he would not have approved LLS as an approved vendor. Ng knew that he had misconducted himself when he failed to declare that LLS was owned by his relative. Ng was terminated from his employment with SEP on 20 January 2016.

13     Between 2013 and 2015, Ng referred 43 jobs to LLS. For 22 of the jobs (with a total value of S$97,819.58), Ng instructed the Accused to make payments to him soon after SEP had paid LLS. The Accused either passed cash to Ng, or included the money in his bank transfers to Ng.

14     In this manner, the Accused gave a total amount of S$1,100 – S$2,200 to Ng over 22 occasions.

## Facts relating to DAC Nos. 939275-2018 to 939281-2018

15     Investigation further revealed that, on each of the following dates, the Accused had given Ng a sum of S$50 – S$100 as his reward for referring contracts with SEP to LLS:

16     By virtue of the foregoing, the Accused had corruptly given gratification of S$50 – S$100 to Ng on each of the 7 occasions, as a reward for him referring contracts to LLS. He has therefore committed offences punishable under section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap. 241), and is charged accordingly.

17     On 15 May 2019, Ng surrendered S$1,100 to the CPIB.

## Antecedents

18     The Accused is untraced for any previous offence.

## The Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence**[^1]**

19     The Prosecution had submitted that the following factors should be considered by the Court when sentencing the Accused:

> a.     The main sentencing consideration for corruption cases are that of deterrence and punishment;

> b.     The Accused’s offences were premeditated;

> c.     The Accused was the sole proprietor of his business. Instead of running the business honestly, he had allowed corruption to thrive;

> d.     Notwithstanding the Accused was not the initiator of the corrupt transactions, the Accused’s business would have enjoyed the profits generated by the corrupt payments to Ng. The 22 jobs which underlied the 22 charges against the Accused had a total value of S$97,819.58. Ng had disgorged S$1,100 to the CPIB and the amount has been forfeited to the State. However, the Accused did not disgorge any of the benefits he had derived from the tainted contracts;

> e.     The Accused committed a total of 22 offences over a span of 2 years. There was therefore sustained and persistent offending;

> f.     The Accused’s offences fell within the category 2 cases as defined in _Public Prosecutor v Syed Mostofa Romel_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 1166</span> (“_Romel”_), for which custodial sentences should be imposed. _Romel_ category 2 provides for cases where the receiving party was paid to forbear from performing what he was duty bound to do, thereby conferring a benefit on the paying party. In this case, in breach of his duty, Ng had recommended LLS to his superior for inclusion as one of SEP’s approved vendors without first comparing LLS’ prices to that of two other vendors.

> g.     That there should be parity of sentences between co-accused. The Prosecution had proceeded with 7 similar charges under section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act against Ng and Ng was sentenced to 1 weeks’ imprisonment per charge and the judge in Ng’s case had ordered for 3 of the sentences to run consecutive making the total sentence of 3 weeks’ imprisonment.

> h.     On the point of parity of sentence, the Prosecution had referred me to the case of _Chua Tiong Tiong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] SGHC 182</span>, where Yong Pung How CJ \[at 21\] had made the following comments:

>> “I endorsed the general principle that in most cases the giver of gratification bears equal culpability to that of the receiver. Sentences meted out should therefore be similar in terms. There are cases where a giver will not warrant a similar punishment as that of the receiver, such as when a giver was under compulsion or some form of pressure to give. In that situation, it is reasonable to punish the receiver more harshly than the giver. Conversely, there are instances where a giver bears equal, if not more, culpability than the receiver, and this is when the giver intends to corrupt the establishment of law and order for his private gain, and/or gives or offers bribes to pervert the course of justice. In these cases, the giver deserves more punishment.”

> i.     In the present case, the Prosecution was of the view that other than the fact that Ng was the initiator, there is no evidence to show that the Accused is less culpable than Ng and this court should impose a similar sentence to that which was imposed by the courts on Ng.

20     The Prosecution had also tendered a Table of Sentencing Precedent which is attached as Annex A in support of their submissions.

21     Given the above factors, the Prosecution was of the view that the custodial threshold has been crossed and the Prosecution had sought a total sentence of 3 weeks’ imprisonment for the Accused.

## Mitigation

22     The Defence has urged me to consider the following mitigating factors[^2]:

> i.     The Accused is a 43 year old male Singapore who is married since 2015. His wife is expecting twins and she is due in November 2019. The Accused’s wife, who is a homemaker, has been strongly advised to rest in bed and the Accused is expected to take good care of her.

> ii.     The Accused is a law-abiding citizen with no previous antecedents.

> iii.     At all times, the Accused had cooperated with the CPIB officers and he is pleading guilty before this court.

> iv.     At all material times, the Accused was the sole proprietor of Lim Logistic Service and Trading (“LLS”) while Ng was a logistic officer employed by Singapore Epson Industrial Pte Ltd (“SEP”). In 2013, SEP was in need of a range of services from the supply of manpower to the purchase of packing materials. As the transaction volume for each of these services was small, it was not practical to engage different vendors. Ng then suggested to his manager that SEP should engage the services of one vendor who could perform all of the services. Ng then recommended LLS to provide the services to SEP.

> v.     The appointment of LLS was approved by SEP and for every service provided, LLS would submit a quotation to SEP for their perusal and approval. In this case, in carrying out his duties to SEP, the Accused had worked hard and he had never received any complaints from SEP regarding his services.

> vi.     Separately, Ng and the Accused also jointly run a business which procures and sells jumbo bags (“Jumbo Bag Business”). In respect of this business, one of the Accused’s duties was to collect money from the Jumbo Bag Business customers. The Accused is a small time vendor who faced financial difficulties, he did not always have enough to pay his own suppliers and employees. Out of goodwill, Ng agreed to temporarily loan the Accused some of the revenue from the Jumbo Bag Business so that the Accused could pay his suppliers and employees so that he could fulfil his obligation to SEP. Ng and the Accused are also cousins and they are related to each other by blood. The Defence had orally submitted in court that due to their business relationship and blood ties, the Accused could not reject Ng’s request when Ng asked him for gratification for helping LLS obtain work from SEP.

## The Defence’s position on sentencing

23     The Defence also submitted that the total amount of gratification in respect of the 7 proceeded charges was only $350 while the total gratification amount in respect of all the charges was only $1,100. Given the small amount involved, the Defence is of the view that the present case should fall within the first category as set out in _Romel’s c_ase and the appropriate sentence to be imposed on the Accused would be a fine.

24     In terms of sentencing principles, the Defence had submitted that the Singapore Courts have accepted three broad (and non-exhaustive) ways in which private sector corruption could take place: set out by Menon CJ in _Romel’s_ case and applied by Chao Hick Tin JA in the High Court case of _Heng Tze Yong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 976</span> (_“Heng Tze Yong”_) at \[19\].

25     The Defence had submitted that the present case falls within the first category which was set out in _Romel_ at \[26\] as follows:

> “First, where the receiving party is paid to confer on the paying party a benefit that is within the receiving party’s power to confer, without regard to whether the paying party ought properly to have received that benefit. This is typically done at the payer’s behest.”

As stated in _Mostofa Romel_ at \[27\], an example where a case falls within this first category is where the receiving party favourably recommends the goods or services offered by the paying party, analogous to the present matter.

26     The Defence also pointed out that the Court which dealt with Ng’s case had also pointed out during sentencing that Ng’s case would fall under _Romel_ Category 1. And as stated in _Romel_ at \[27\], “whether the custodial threshold is crossed will depend on the facts”.

27     In the present case, the Defence was of the view that the amount of gratification was an important factor to be considered for the purposes of sentencing. At \[20\] of _Romel_, guidance was provided as follows:

> “Where private sector agents are concerned, offences which register a lower level of culpability can be dealt with by the imposition of fines. Such cases are _generally_ those **_where the amount of gratification is below $30,000 and where there is no real detriment to the interests of the principal_**… That, however, does not give rise to or support a presumption in favour of non-custodial sentences whenever private sector corruption is concerned. Indeed, it is critical in this context to be sensitive to the specific nature of corruption that one is concerned with. \[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics\]”

28     The Defence also pointed out that in the case of _Heng Tze Yong_ at \[24-25\], the Court had regarded the amount of gratification as not just one of the factors to be considered, but as an **important** factor to be considered, having a correlation with the harm caused by an offence and the potential need to deter the creation of a corrupt business culture at the highest levels of commerce:

> “24    The DJ was right in observing that there was no rule that cases involving bribes less than $30,000 should only attract a fine. However, I had some reservations about his statement that the amount of gratification was “_just_ one of the factors” \[emphasis added\] to be considered. This statement suggested that the amount of gratification was a factor of ordinary weight, when it was in fact an important factor. As V K Rajah JA held in _PP v Ang Seng Thor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 217</span> (_“Ang Seng Thor_”) at \[64\]:

>> The District Court in _Yeoh Hock Lam_ attempted (at \[24\] to suggest a specific amount of gratification (viz, $30,000) below which the custody threshold would generally not be breached. On my part, I do not think the factual complexities of the sentencing process permit such a precise figure to be provided. However, _I agree that the amount of gratification is an important factor in determining whether the sentence should be custodial or not_ as it has a _correlation with the harm caused by an offence_ (see \[46\] above) and the _potentialneed to deter the creation of a corrupt business culture at the highest levels of commerce_ (see \[42\] above). \[emphasis added\]

> 25     **The amount of gratification involved remains an important factor in determining the proper sentence for corruption offences.** The reasons for regarding this factor as important, which are summarised in the passage above, remained relevant: **the amount of gratification still correlates with the harm caused by the bribe and the need to deter the creation of a corrupt business culture at the highest level of commerce**. Additionally, there is nothing in _Mostofa Romel_ to suggest that the amount of gratification is no longer an important factor. In fact, this factor is expressly referred to in the judgment, including in the passage reproduced above at \[21\] above (see also _Mostofa Romel_ at \[23\]. In my view, **it is a matter of justice and common sense that the amount involved would be an important factor**. \[Emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold and underlined\]”

29     The Defence also drew my attention to the following cases whereby fines have been imposed in place of custodial sentences:

> i.     In _Heng Tze Yong_, the accused had pleaded guilty of one charge of corruptly giving gratification of $7,000 contrary to s 6(b) of the PCA, with another similar charge of corruptly giving gratification of $3,000 contrary to s 6(b) of the PCA taken into consideration. The accused was originally sentenced to 5 weeks’ imprisonment but on appeal, his sentence was set aside and substituted with a fine of $35,000.

> ii.     In _Thor Chi Tiong v PP (MA No. 9123 of 2016)_, the accused pleaded guilty to one charge of corruptly giving a gratification of $10,000, as a reward for the receiver’s assistance in securing business for the accused’s company. The accused was originally sentenced to 6 weeks’ imprisonment but on appeal, Sundaresh Menon CJ set aside the accused’s term of imprisonment and substituted it with a fine of $35,000. This is an unreported decision, but some details of the case were stated in _Heng Tze Yong_ at \[14-16\].

> iii.     In _PP v Tom Goh Lye Tiong <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 337</span>_, the accused had claimed trial to a charge under s 6(b) PCA of corruptly giving gratification of $1,000 as an inducement. He was fined $5,000 after a full trial.

## Defence’s Submission on the issue of parity of sentencing

30     In the present case, Ng had received a sentence of 3 weeks’ imprisonment for his offences. On the issue of parity of sentencing, the Defence had referred me to the High Court case of _Public Prosecutor v Marzuki bin Ahmad and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 623</span> (_“Marzuki bin Ahmad_”). In _Marzuki bin Ahmad_, Sundaresh Menon CJ, in considering Yong Pung How CJ’s decision in _Chua Tiong Tiong v PP_ \[2001\] 2SLR(R)515, clarified the application of the principle of parity of sentencing between the giver and the recipient of gratification at \[45\] as follows:

> “In my judgment, the effect of these remarks, taken together, is that the principle of parity of sentencing as between the giver and the recipient of gratification **cannot be viewed or applied as an inflexible and rigid rule**. Although the general principle is that the giver and the recipient of gratification are equally culpable, **many other factors must also be considered** when deciding on the sentence to be imposed on the particular accused person who is before the court. These factors may relate to the degree of culpability of each individual offender in committing the corrupt acts, as well as circumstances unique to each offender (bearing in mind too the general approach to sentencing for s 6(_a_) offences set out earlier at \[28\] above). Leaving that aside, in the case of a party to a corrupt transaction who is sentenced after his counterparty in the same transaction has been separately sentenced, it could also be that the sentence imposed on the counterparty in the earlier decision might have been too high or too low by reference to the applicable sentencing precedents. **The court must always have the flexibility, when sentencing a party to a corrupt transaction, to depart from the earlier sentence imposed on his counterparty in the same transaction where that is the appropriate course of action to take**.”

31     The Defence had submitted that in sentencing, the Court can depart from the sentencing position for that of the co-accused and some factors to be considered can include: (1) the degree of culpability of each individual offender; (2) circumstances unique to each offender; and (3) whether the sentence imposed on the counterparty in the earlier decision was too high or too low by reference to applicable sentencing precedents.

32     The Defence also pointed out that in _Marzuki bin Ahmad_, the Court did in fact decline to apply strictly the principle of parity of sentencing. The accused was sentenced to 8 months’ jail when his co-accused had been sentenced to 12 months’ jail.

33     The Defence was of the view that Ng’s case can be clearly differentiated from the present case as follows:

> (a)     Ng’s culpability is much higher. It was Ng who had initiated the bribes and who had proposed to our client that our client give him $50 to $100 a month to reward him. Our client did not initiate the bribes and would have found it very difficult to reject Ng’s requests given their familial and ongoing business relationship.

> (b)     Ng was senior logistics officer at SEP. By engaging in the receipt of bribes, he would have seriously breached his duties to his company and betrayed their trust and confidence in him. Whereas our client was sole proprietor at LLS, so that the duty owed was to himself.

> (c)     The risk of any loss lied with SEP. If Ng had made an unreliable recommendation, SEP (which is Ng’s company) would stand to lose the most. Ng is thus more culpable than our client.

34     The Defence also submitted that the sentence imposed on Ng may have been too high, and the Accused’s our client’s sentence ought not to be pegged to the same.

35     Given the above, the Defence was of the view that an appropriate sentence for the Accused should be a fine of not more than $15,000.

## My Decision

36     The 7 charges that the Accused had pleaded guilty to are similar charges under section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241 save for the date of the offences and the work done by the Accused for SEP. The punishment for an offence under section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act is a fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.

## The relevant principles of law

37     This is a case involving private sector corruption. In _Romel’s_ case at \[19 – 23\], Menon CJ had noted:

> “19    Turning then to corruption in the private sector, I would first observe that Singapore has taken private sector corruption very seriously. Indeed, at the second reading of the Prevention of Corruption Bill which I referred to at \[14\] above, Mr Ong also said that:

>> … As stated in the Explanatory Statement, the object of this Bill is to provide for the more effective prevention of corruption by remedying various weaknesses and defects which experience has revealed in the existing Prevention of Corruption Ordinance. The Bill, while directed mainly at corruption in the public services, is applicable also to _corruption by private agents, trustees and others in a fiduciary capacity_. To those who corrupt and those who are corrupt, the warning is clear – take heed and mend their ways. Just retribution will follow those who persist in corrupt practices. \[emphasis added\]

> 20    Where private sector agents are concerned, offences which register a lower level of culpability _can_ be dealt with by the imposition of fines. Such cases are _generally_ those where the amount of gratification is below $30,000 and where there is no real detriment to the interests of the principal (see _Practitioners’ Library: Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts_ vol 2 (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2013) (“_Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts_”) at p 1375). That, however, does not give rise to or support a presumption in favour of non-custodial sentences whenever private sector corruption is concerned. Indeed, it is critical in this context to be sensitive to the _specific nature_ of corruption that one is concerned with. This was just what Yong CJ emphasised in _Lim Teck Chye v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 2 SLR(R) 525</span> (“_Lim Teck Chye_”) at \[65\] when he noted:

>> The appellant had also cited _PP v Yeoh Hock Lam_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] SGDC 212</span>, unreported judgment dated 9 July 2001. The district judge presiding in that case had juxtaposed corruption in the public arena with that in the private sector (at \[22\] and \[24\]):

>> This was not a typical corrupt transaction where one party obtains a bribe which rewards or conduces to unlawful conduct interfering with the administration of justice … But in the final analysis, the transactions had taken place in a ‘commercial’ context.

>> Where the amount of gratification received is relatively low, and where it is not in excess of $30,000, a substantial fine will _usually be adequate_ punishment. The offender will have to forfeit his ill-gotten gratification as well. This is the established sentencing practice where the offenders are not public officers and there is no taint on the integrity of the public service. I did not see any justification to impose a different sentence on the accused.

>> …

>> **_It was clear that the district judge’s statements above did not stand for the proposition that corruption in a commercial context cannot be punished with imprisonment, although it usually is adequate. Indeed, the PCA expressly provides for the imposition of imprisonment sentences regardless of whether the offence was committed in the public arena_**. Of course, whether a custodial sentence is warranted in a particular case is determined upon a careful consideration of sentencing principles such as the public interest and other policy considerations, as well as the gravity of the offence including the particular facts and circumstances thereof: _PP v Tan Fook Sum_<span class="citation">\[1999\] 1 SLR 523</span>.

> \[High Court’s emphasis in _Lim Teck Chye_ in italics; emphasis added in bold italics\]

> 21    In a similar vein, V K Rajah JA in _Ang Seng Thor_ (\[10\] _supra_) at \[39\] noted that there is no presumption in favour of a non-custodial sentence where private sector corruption is concerned.

> 22    The United Kingdom Law Commission (“the UK Law Commission”) in its report, _Legislating the Criminal Code: Corruption_ (Cmnd 248, 1998) (Chairperson: Dame Mary Arden), also observed at para 3.28 that while in general, corruption on the part of a public servant is likely to be more damaging to the public interest and thus to be viewed as a more serious offence than corruption in the private sector, that was not inevitably so, and that a _rigid_ distinction between the two is unwarranted; some instances of private sector corruption could be very serious while some instances of public sector corruption could be less serious than private sector corruption. The UK Law Commission’s view was that ultimately, the seriousness of the offence should be a matter that is considered and best addressed at the sentencing stage. This appears to mirror the views of the Australian Model Criminal Code Officers Committee where in their report on the Model Criminal Code, _Chapter 3: Theft, Fraud, Bribery and Related Offences_ (1995) at p 245, it was observed that:

>> … The secret commissions paid to Johns in the Tricontinental Bank case amounted to $2 million. The corrupting effect of a secret commission of that amount on confidence in the _general_ commerce and finances of the community were very serious and more harmful than many instances of bribery in the public sector. … The public needs to be able to have confidence in the integrity of both the public and the private sector. … The amount of damage in a particular case should be a question for sentencing … \[emphasis in original\]

> 23    In Singapore, it has been noted that where private sector corruption involves (a) a significant amount of gratification; (b) gratification which is received over a lengthy period of time; or (c) a compromise of one’s duty or a serious betrayal of trust, the starting point is likely to be a _custodial sentence_ (see _Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts_ at p 1375).”

38     Menon CJ in _Romel_ at \[26\] was of the view that public sector corruption can be classified into 3 broad categories:

> “26    The ways in which private sector corruption can manifest its ugly head are diverse. But in my judgment, the factual patterns that emerge from much of the prevailing case law can, for convenient analysis, be fit into three broad and non-exhaustive categories:

>> (a)    First, where the receiving party is paid to confer on the paying party a benefit that is within the receiving party’s power to confer, without regard to whether the paying party ought properly to have received that benefit. This is typically done at the payer’s behest.

>> (b)    Second, where the receiving party is paid to forbear from performing what he is duty bound to do, thereby conferring a benefit on the paying party. Such benefit typically takes the form of avoiding prejudice which would be occasioned to the paying party if the receiving party discharged his duty as he ought to have. This also is typically done at the payer’s behest.

>> (c)    Third, where a receiving party is paid so that he will forbear from inflicting harm on the paying party, even though there may be no lawful basis for the infliction of such harm. This is typically done at the _receiving party’s_ behest.

> 27    A case falling within the first category occurs, for example, where the receiving party purchases or favourably recommends the goods or services offered by the paying party. This was what happened in _Ang Seng Thor_. In this category, whether the custodial threshold is crossed will depend on the facts.

> 28    A case falling within the second category occurs, for example, where the receiving party, who is under a duty to inspect the paying party’s goods or work, slackens in his inspection or turns a blind eye to any deficiencies in the paying party’s goods or work. This was what happened in _Lim Teck Chye_ (\[20\] _supra_). These cases, as I have noted above at \[23\] above, will frequently attract custodial sentences.

> 29    Into the third category will fall cases where the paying party does not in fact seek a favour. Rather, the third category is characterised by the heightened culpability of the receiving party due to the presence of two factors: first, in his seeking out payment from the paying party, whether this is done implicitly or explicitly; and second, in his threat, if the bribe is not paid, to inflict harm on the paying party when there is no lawful basis for doing so. These factors will generally result in the paying party being faced with the deprivation of his legitimate rights unless he pays a bribe. Such cases would include cases, for example, where a bribe is solicited by a person who receives applications for licences or permits, to ensure that an applicant’s application is timeously processed and not somehow inexplicably misplaced.

> 30    In this third category of cases, where corruption involves interference with or deprivation of a person’s legitimate rights unless a bribe is paid, the receiving party can generally expect a custodial sentence. In my judgment, this kind of corruption is antithetical to everything that Singapore stands for as it undermines the confidence that if a person needs something such as a permit or licence to do business in Singapore, it will be forthcoming without bribes being paid. It also destroys the notion that business in Singapore is clean and transparent and that rules are there for good reason rather than to give people in whom discretion is vested or upon whom duties are placed, opportunities to have their palms greased and their pockets lined. In such cases, all would-be offenders must be warned that such acts, which undermine legitimate rights, will not be tolerated and will be severely dealt with.

> 31    I should stress that these three categories are meant only as analytical tools for the very many factual scenarios in which corruption may manifest itself. These categories are not watertight; they shade into one another. They are also not intended to be determinative of any case. Instead, they serve as a reminder that sentencing, especially in the context of corruption, is an intensely factual exercise. The court must correctly locate the facts of the case, including the circumstances of the offender that is before it within the continuum of the facts in previously decided cases before coming to a conclusion as to the appropriate sentence.”

39     I agree with the Prosecution’s submission that the main sentencing consideration in all corruption cases is that of general deterrence. I am of the view that based on the facts of the present case, this case should come within the 1st category of the private sector corruption cases as defined in _Romel._ I also note that where the amount of gratification received is relatively low, a substantial fine will **_usually be adequate_** punishment. However, the amount of gratification is but one of the many factors to be considered. It is also clear that that is no presumption in favour of a non-custodial sentence for private sector corruption cases and whether the custodial threshold is crossed will depend on the facts of each case.

40     I further note that where private sector corruption involves (a) a significant amount of gratification; (b) gratification which is received over a lengthy period of time; or (c) a compromise of one’s duty or a serious betrayal of trust, the starting point is likely to be a custodial sentence.

41     In this case, the 22 charges are similar in nature and the amount of gratification per charge is “$50 to $100”. Taken as a whole, the total amount of gratification for the 22 charges would be “$1,100 to $2,200”.

42     However, I also note the following aggravating factors in the present case:-

> a.     The Accused faced a total of 22 charges. The Prosecution had proceeded with 7 charges and the remaining 15 were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

> b.     The period of corruption was a very long period. The Accused had been paying Ng for referring work from SEP to LLS for a period of 2 years from 2013 to 2015. As a result, the Accused managed to get 43 jobs from SEP. I agree with the Prosecution that there was sustained and persistent offending. This was not a one-off transgression or a momentary lapse of judgment. The Accused’s conduct was deliberate, sustained and persistent and this is a clear aggravating factor.

> c.     The Accused was the sole proprietor of his business. Notwithstanding the Accused was not the initiator of the corrupt transactions, the Accused as sole proprietor would have stood to gain fully 100% of all the business and profits generated by the gratifications paid to Ng. I also note that there was no pre-existing business relationship between the Accused and SEP before Ng made the referrals. This would mean that if Ng had not referred the Accused to SEP by using his position in SEP, the Accused would probably have not gotten the 43 jobs from SEP.

> d.     According to Statement of Facts, between 2013 and 2015, Ng referred 43 jobs to LLS. For 22 of the jobs (with a total value of S$97,819.58), Ng had instructed the Accused to make payments to him soon after SEP had paid LLS. The sum of $97,819.58 is a sizeable amount of money earned by the Accused from this illegal arrangement.

> e.     And although Ng had asked for payment for only 22 of 43 the jobs, the fact remains that the Accused was awarded a total of 43 jobs from SEP from Ng’s recommendation and the benefits derived by the Accused for these 43 jobs would have been much higher than the sum of $97,819.58 which he was paid for the 22 jobs.

> f.     The Defence had submitted that $97,819.58 is just the total contract amount for the 22 jobs and it is not the net profit earned by the Accused. However, I am in agreement with the Prosecution that if not for Ng’s referral, the Accused would not have been awarded these contracts by SEP. I also note that the Accused has not disgorged any of the benefits/profits he had derived from the tainted contracts.

> g.     In paragraphs 6 to 8 of the Statement of Facts, the Accused had admitted that it was Ng who had proposed to the Accused to give him $50 to 100 a month to reward him for helping to refer contracts from SEP to LLS and the Accused had agreed to do so even though he knew what Ng had done was wrong. And after Ng had referred the 43 jobs to LLS, Ng instructed the Accused to make payments to him soon after SEP had paid LLS and the Accused passed the money to Ng by way of cash payment or bank transfer. The Accused’s behaviour clearly show that he did not commit the offences on the spur of the moment and that he was prepared to pay Ng so long as Ng is able to continue giving him jobs from SEP. This clearly show a blatant and persistent conduct on the part of the Accused to commit the offences.

43     Given the above aggravating factors, taking into account the totality of the Accused’s criminal conduct, I am of the view that the custodial threshold has been crossed in this case.

44     The Defence had also submitted that the Accused was unable to reject Ng’s request because of his business relationship and blood ties with Ng, who is his cousin. I do not agree with the Defence on this point. On the contrary, given that they are family members, I am of the view that it would be easier for the Accused to be honest with Ng and reject him because of their blood ties.

## Parity of Sentence

45     On the issue of parity of sentence, it is a general principle that the giver of gratification bears equal culpability to that of the receiver and sentences meted out should be similar. However, I agree with the Defence that this cannot be viewed or applied as an inflexible and rigid rule and other factors must be considered when deciding on the sentence to be imposed on the particular accused person who is before the court.

46     I also accept that the Court can depart from the sentencing position for that of the co-accused and some factors to be considered can include: (1) the degree of culpability of each individual offender; (2) circumstances unique to each offender; and (3) whether the sentence imposed on the counterparty in the earlier decision was too high or too low by reference to applicable sentencing precedents.

47     The Defence had in their submission suggested that the Accused was under a compulsion or pressure to give the gratification because of his business dealings and family ties with Ng. I would only repeat what I had said in paragraph 45 above.

48     As to the Defence’s submission that the sentences meted out in Ng’s case is too high, I wish to say that I am not in a position to comment on whether the sentence that was meted out in Ng’s case was manifestly excessive because there was no reported decision in Ng’s case nor was there any appeal filed by Ng against sentence.

49     In the present case, I agree with the Prosecution that other than the fact that Ng had initiated the giving of the gratification, there is nothing relating to the Accused’s culpability or his circumstances to warrant a departure from the sentence imposed in Ng’s case.

## My Sentence

50     Having considered the Prosecution’s address on sentence and the Defence’s mitigation plea, I imposed the following sentences on the Accused:

51     I am of the view that the total sentence of 3 weeks’ imprisonment is a fair and reasonable sentence given the circumstances of this case.

52     The Accused has applied for a stay of execution pending appeal and I had granted his application for a stay accordingly. The Accused is currently on bail pending appeal.
