## B.   Punishment Prescribed by Law

2       For DAC 944757-2017, the punishment prescribed under section 353 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) is imprisonment for a term which may extend to 4 years, or with fine, or with both.

3       For MAC 900758-2018, the punishment prescribed under section 20 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act, Chapter 184 is a fine not exceeding $2,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both for a 1st conviction, and in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.

4       For MAC 900849-2018, the punishment prescribed under Section 6(3) of the Protection from Harassment Act (“POHA”), Chapter 256A is a fine not exceeding $5000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.

5       At the conclusion of the trial, I was satisfied that the Prosecution has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him of all 3 charges on 29 August 2019. I then adjourned the matter for the Prosecution to prepare their submissions on sentencing and for the Defence to prepare their mitigation plea.

6       I had originally fixed the matter for sentencing on 26 September 2019 but the Defence Counsel had requested for more time as the Accused wanted to see a psychiatrist for sentencing purposes. I then adjourned the matter to 30 October 2019 pending the psychiatrist report.

7       On 30 October 2019, after hearing the Prosecution’s address on sentence and the Defence’s mitigation plea, I imposed the following sentences on the Accused:-

8       The Accused being dissatisfied with my decision has filed his Notice of Appeal against conviction and sentence. Accordingly, I set out my reasons for both the conviction and sentence.

## C.   The Prosecution’s Case[^1]

9       The Prosecution had called the following witnesses give evidence of their behalf:

> (a)     Sgt Jeffrey Chong Teck Wei (“PW1”), the victim;

> (b)     Tan See Hua (“PW2”), an interpreter from CID who had translated the video from PW1’s BWC; and

> (c)     Woman Sgt Chiam Shu Qin Sally (“PW3”), PW1’s partner, who had responded to the taxi driver’s call together with PW1.

10     The Prosecution also tendered the following exhibits in support of their case against the Accused :-

> (a)     The First Information Report dated 6 December 2017 (“Exhibit P1”);

> (b)     The Body Worn Camera (“BWC”) video footage of PW1 (“Exhibit P2”); and

> (c)     The transcript of the BWC video footage (“Exhibit P3”)

11     The Prosecution’s case is based on the BWC footage (Exhibit P2), along with the transcription/translation of the footage (Exhibit P3) prepared by CID interpreter PW2 Tan See Hua (“the transcript”), and supported by the testimonies of PW1 and his partner, PW3.

12     The Prosecution’s position is that on 6 December 2017, after consuming some alcoholic beverages at a company event, the Accused boarded a taxi to go home. When the taxi arrived at Blk 420 Hougang Avenue 10, where the Accused stays, the taxi driver was unable to collect the taxi fare from the Accused because he insisted on making payment through his hand-phone, but the battery was flat. The taxi driver called ‘999’ at 11.47pm and reported: “_I am taxi driver transcab SHB7646K, I have problem with my china man was drunk and causing trouble. (commotion heard)_” (Exhibit P1).

13     PW1 and PW3 arrived at the scene at about 11.54pm and spoke to the Accused and the taxi driver separately to find out what was happening. PW1 spoke to the Accused and observed that he “_smelled strongly of alcohol_” and “_was a bit drunk_” but was otherwise still able to converse with him[^2]. From their conversation, PW1 gathered that the Accused did not have cash to pay the taxi fare and that he wanted to use his hand-phone to make payment, but the battery was flat.

14     The officers then suggested to the Accused alternative means of making payment such as going up to his unit to take cash or calling someone to bring cash down for him[^3]. The Accused ignored these suggestions and continued insisting that PW1 charge his hand-phone for him. The Accused also refused to produce either his identity card or verbally recite his particulars to the officers.

15     When the Accused was not able to get his hand-phone charged, he began behaving rowdily by shouting, gesturing and moving close to the officers. From the Accused’s behaviour, PW1 sensed that “_at any point of time, there is a potential that he can assault us_”[^4]. The Accused’s agitation and aggression was also sensed by PW3, who saw that the accused was “_closing in onto my partner_” and “_was close enough to maybe cause harm or anything_.”[^5]

16     PW1 pinpointed 12 instances where the Accused deliberately made contact with him by pushing his right hand and arm away and tapping his right shoulder twice[^6]. Screenshots of these 12 instances, as well as, where relevant, the dialogue between the officers and the Accused before and after each time the Accused made contact with PW1, have been reproduced at Annex A of the Prosecution’s End of Trial Submissions.

17     The Accused’s refusal to cooperate continued even after PW1 told him that he would be arrested. The Accused ignored clear instructions for him to put his hands behind his back to be handcuffed. The Accused resisted arrest by struggling with the officers and it took both officers several minutes before they could handcuff the accused. During the struggle the Accused also repeatedly verbally abused the officers and said to PW1: “_Singapore has policemen like you all, too stupid_.”[^7]

18     The Prosecution was of the view that the Accused’s behaviour towards the officers clearly showed that he had no regard for their authority and he had made no attempt to cooperate with even the simplest of requests.

19     The Prosecution also submitted that based on the BWC video footage, it is clear that the Accused had intended to use criminal force to PW1 by repeatedly pushed PW1’s right hand and arm away, and tapping PW1’s right shoulder twice. It is also clear that the insulting words were clearly directed at PW1. The BWC video footage also show the Accused continuously shouting, gesturing and behaving aggressively, essentially creating a scene at the carpark.

## D.   The Defence’s Case**[^8]**

20     The Defence submitted that the whole incident that took place between 6 December 2017 and 7 December 2017 was a series of misunderstandings amongst all the parties.

## a.   The section 353 criminal force charge

21     In respect of the section 353 charge, the Defence’s position is that there were only 5 instances where there were bodily contact between the Accused and PW1 but in all 5 of these instances, the Accused did not intend to use criminal force against PW1. As such there was no mens rea on the part of the Accused to use criminal force against PW1[^9].

22     The Defence had submitted that the evidence relating to the 5 instances are as follows:-

> i.     The 1st incident involved 4 bodily contacts between the Accused and PW1 at 23:54:44, 23:54:48, 23:54:51 and 23:54:57 hours (as seen from P2). During this period, the both the Accused and PW1 were communicating and PW1 had suddenly stretched out his hand and the Accused was scared by the PW1’s action and he responded by using his hand in response. The Accused had no intention of attacking PW1[^10].

> ii.     The 2nd incident happened at 23:57:12 hours. The Accused is trained to give speeches. Stretching out both his hands in both directions was to strengthen what he was trying to express thereby enhancing his expression which is to charge his hand-phone. The Defence had submitted that the Accused was not actively looking at PW1 when he was stretching his hands in opposite directions and he accidentally and unintentionally touched PW1’s BWC. The Accused did not tap PW1’s shoulder but he just touched the BWC[^11].

> iii.     The 3rd incident happened at 23:59 hours. The Accused was talking to PW1 when PW1 suddenly grabbed the Accused’s right arm and the Accused reacted accordingly. PW1’s grab on the Accused’s arm had caused discomfort to the Accused and the Accused had to remove PW1’s hand in order to ease his discomfort. These are natural reactions between bodily contacts with each both[^12]. The Defence was of the view that this is not tantamount to using criminal force against PW1.

> iv.     The 4th incident happened at 00:00:43 hours. The Defence’s case here is that it was not the Accused who pushed PW1 but it was PW1 who was repeatedly pushing the Accused. As a result, the Accused had to move backwards, and he almost fell backwards[^13].

> v.     The 5th incident happened at 00:02:12 hours. This incident happened when the police officers were in the process of placing the handcuffs on the Accused. The Defence’s position is that the instructions given by both PW1 and PW3 to place the Accused under arrest and to place his hands behind to be cuffed was not clear. That was why the Accused kept placing his hands in front for the officers to be handcuffed. In this situation, parties were at cross purposes and although there was bodily contact, the Accused never had any intention to use criminal force on PW1.[^14]

## b.   The disorderly behaviour charge

23     With regard to the disorderly behaviour charge, the Defence’s position is that the Accused did not act disorderly in the beginning on the night of 6 October 2017 when PW1 and PW3 first arrived at the scene. The trigger point was when PW3 was having a conversation with the Accused and PW3 uttered the word “nonsense”. This caused the Accused to raise his voice. According to P3, PW3 1st uttered the word “nonsense” at 23:59:09 hours[^15].

24     The Accused’s position is that he was not continuously shouting or continuously gesturing or continuously behaving aggressively throughout the whole period from 11.47 pm till 12.04 am. And since the Accused was not behaving in a disorderly behaviour continuously throughout the whole period as per the charge, the charge is not made out and he should be acquitted of the charge[^16].

## c.   The section 6(1) POHA charge

25     The Accused does not deny utterly the words “Singapore has policemen like you all, too stupid”. However, the Accused’s position is that his words were not directed at PW1. The Accused’s position is that he was merely expressing his dismay and disappointment at the situation and it was not meant for PW1 to hear.[^17]

## E.   Assessment of the Evidence

## a.   PW1’s Evidence

26     On 6 December 2017, PW1 was on duty with PW3 and he had responded to P1, which is the First Information Report by the taxi driver[^18]. When they arrived at the scene at about 11.50 pm, they saw the Accused and the taxi driver having a minor dispute. The officers then separated both of them and PW1 spoke to the Accused while PW3 spoke to the taxi driver[^19].

27     PW1 observed that the Accused smelled strongly of alcohol and that he was a bit drunk but he was still able to converse in English with PW1[^20].

28     PW1 then determined the issue between the Accused and the taxi driver. The Accused did not have cash to pay the taxi driver. The Accused also told PW1 to charge his hand-phone for him to pay the taxi fare. PW1 tried to ask the Accused how he was going to pay the taxi fare if PW1 charged his hand-phone but the Accused did not reply him[^21].

29     PW1 also tried to ask the Accused for his particulars and/or his NRIC but the Accused refused to give the same to PW1. PW1 then told the Accused that if he did not have any cash he could get someone down from his home to pay the taxi driver or the police officers could escort him to his home to get money but the Accused refused. PW1 also said that the Accused was rowdy and he was aggressive and did not show respect[^22].

30      In relation to the criminal force charge, PW1 said that when he was talking to the Accused, the Accused wanted to hand over his hand-phone and insisted PW1 to charge his phone. The Accused kept approaching PW1 and PW1 raised his hand to keep a safe distance but the Accused used his right hand and grabbed PW1’s hand several times and also pushed away his hands several times[^23]. Later when PW1 tried to return the Accused’s hand-phone, the Accused used his left hand to tap PW1’s shoulders 2 times[^24].

31     As for the instances where the Accused used criminal force, PW1 noted the following instances when the Accused applied criminal force on him :-

> i.     At 23:54:54 hours, PW1 was trying to get the Accused particulars, the Accused refused to furnish the particulars and when PW1 reached out his hand, the Accused grabbed his hand several times. PW1 warned the Accused not to touch his hand but the Accused continued to grab and push his hand[^25].

> ii.     Between 23:54:54 to 23:57:11 hours, the Accused kept insisting that PW1 charge his hand-phone for him to pay the taxi fare. PW1 asked the Accused multiple times how he was going to pay the taxi fare with his hand-phone but the Accused did not answer PW1 specifically. The Accused handed PW1 his hand-phone and insisted that PW1 charge his hand-phone. When PW3 approached the Accused to ask a few questions, PW1 wanted to return his hand-phone and the Accused used his left hand to tap PW1’s shoulder twice. Prior to doing that, the Accused grabbed PW1’s hand and pushed away his hand several times.

> iii.     Between 23:59:37 to 00:04:15 hours, throughout their attempt to arrest the Accused, he was struggling and grabbing at PW1[^26].

32     PW1 also testified when the Accused made contact with his hand, it was intentional as he could feel the force and it was not a friendly gesture. And this was despite PW1 telling the Accused not to touch him multiple times[^27]. As for the tapping on the shoulder, PW1 said that the Accused tapped his shoulder at the time when he was trying to talk to PW3. The impression PW1 got was that the Accused was trying to push him away. Although PW1 did not feel much force, the force of the tap was strong enough to make PW1 take a step back.

33     PW1 also testified that when the Accused grabbed his hand, pushed away his hand and tapped on his shoulder, he felt threatened by the Accused’s action and he did call for assistance through his radio set[^28].

34      As for the disorderly behaviour charge, PW1 said that the Accused was raising his voice when he was using his hand to grab and push PW1’s hand. Throughout PW1’s engagement with the Accused, the Accused was behaving aggressively and shouting about Lee Kuan Yew and police being stupid. The Accused also approached the police officers in an aggressive and non-friendly manner and when they tried to ask him to calm down he refused. This caused concern to PW1 as he felt that at any time, the Accused could potentially assault them[^29].

35     Due to the Accused’s aggressiveness, he also attracted passer-bys and there were people who were looking out of their windows. The Accused was disturbing the peace, he was shouting, drawing attention and it was past mid-night[^30].

36     As a result, the police officers decided to arrest the Accused for disorderly behaviour and during the arrest, the Accused was shouting and refusing to place his hands behind for the officers to put on the handcuffs. The Accused kept putting his hand in front despite instructions to place his hands behind his back and the officers had to use necessary force to pin him down to put on the handcuffs[^31].

37     And even after the Accused was arrested, he continued to shout “Lee Kuan Yew” and other stupid things.[^32]

38     PW1 also provided specific instances of the Accused’s behaviour as follows:-

> i.     From 23:57:15 to 23:57:36 hours, the Accused was getting more aggressive. PW1 tried to keep his distance and he raised his hand to keep the Accused away. However, the Accused kept shouting and behaving aggressively[^33].

> ii.     From 23:59:06 to 23:59:37 hours, the Accused became more aggressive and he kept shouting in Mandarin if Lee Kuan Yew is a laughing stock. The Accused was creating a nuisance[^34].

> iii.     From 23:59:37 to 00:04:15 hours, when the Accused was being arrested, he was shouting and causing nuisance to the public[^35]. When PW1 informed the Accused that he was going to place the Accused under arrest for disorderly behaviour, the Accused refused to co-operate and resisted arrest. Throughout the attempt to place the Accused under arrest, the Accused was shouting and causing nuisance to the public[^36].

39      As for the POHA charge of insulting a public servant, PW1 testified that when after the Accused had been handcuffed was being, the Accused told him “Singapore has this kind of policeman like you, too stupid” and the PW1 felt insulted when the Accused said those words[^37].

## b.   PW3’s Evidence

40     PW3 gave evidence that when they arrived at the scene, she spoke to the taxi driver and the taxi driver explained to her that the Accused had difficulty paying his taxi fares and he wanted to use his hand-phone to pay but his hand-phone was flat and the taxi driver decided to call the police.

41     While PW3 was talking to the taxi driver, she noted that PW1 was engaged in a conversation with the Accused and she decided to assist PW1 after she noticed him raising his voice at the Accused. PW3 also testified that PW1 raised his voice at the Accused because the Accused was uncooperative when PW1 had asked for his particulars[^38].

42     PW3 also tried to engage the Accused to ask for his particulars but the Accused refused to give his particulars to PW3[^39]. PW3 also suggested to the follow the Accused to his home to get money to pay the taxi driver in order resolve the matter but the Accused was uncooperative and did not accept her proposal[^40].

43      In relation to the criminal force charge, PW3 testified that she did not see the whole episode where the Accused had used force on PW1[^41]. PW3 said that she saw less than 5 bodily contacts between the Accused and PW1. However, she remembered seeing the following incidents:-

> i.     PW3 heard PW1 say “Don’t touch me” and she saw the Accused touching PW1’s right shoulder with his left hand. PW3 also testified that the force used by the Accused when touching PW1’s right shoulder was enough to make PW1 move back his right shoulder a little.

> ii.     PW3 also saw the Accused pushing PW1’s hand away[^42].

> iii.     PW3 also noticed that there were a few times when the Accused did push PW1’s hand away downwards[^43]. On these occasions, PW3 was of the view that the Accused did apply force on PW1’s hand in order to push PW1’s hand downwards[^44].

> iv.     PW3 also confirmed that the touching or pushing of the hand and the tapping of the shoulder was momentary[^45].

44     As regards to the Accused’s conduct, PW3 also testified that at around 23:56:31 hours, PW1 did tell the Accused to “keep your distance” because the Accused was closing in on PW3 and PW1 was worried that the Accused was close enough to cause harm to PW3[^46].

45      With regard to the disorderly behaviour charge, PW3 noted that the Accused was raising his voice that night. It was late at night and the Accused’s voice was loud enough to attract attention from the neighbouring blocks and residents from the blocks were actually looking out from their windows to see what was going on[^47].

46     PW3 also testified that she had told the Accused to “watch your manners” because the Accused was behaving in a rowdy manner which is not liked by others[^48].

47     PW3 further testified that:

> i.     Although the Accused was not shouting continuously that night, he did manage to attract the attention of the public[^49].

> ii.     That the Accused was gesturing continuously and behaving aggressively towards PW1 on the night of the incident[^50].

48      As for the POHA charge, PW3 said that after they had arrested the Accused and when they were putting him in the police vehicle, the Accused told PW1 “ Singapore Police Force so stupid”[^51]. PW3 was of the view that the Accused was directing those words at PW1 because the Accused was facing PW1 when he uttered those words[^52].

## c.   PW1’s BWC video recording

49     The Prosecution also tendered the video recording from PW1’s BWC as part of the prosecution’s case. The video recorded was admitted and marked P2. In addition, the Prosecution also tendered a transcript of the video recordings which was admitted and marked P3.

## d.   The Accused’s Evidence

50     The Accused is a director of Vaster New Media. On the night in question, the Accused had attended a dinner & dance function and he had left his wallet in his office and he only had his hand-phone on him[^53].

51     At the dinner & dance function, the Accused had about 4 to 5 glasses of alcohol but he could remember exactly how many drinks he had that night. After dinner, he called Grab and asked the driver to send him to Blk 420 Hougang Avenue 10. Upon reaching Blk 420 Hougang Avenue 10, the Accused was under the impression that the payment would be deducted from his phone application and wanted to leave. However, the driver had insisted that he did not make any payment and wanted him to pay cash. The Accused did not have any cash on him and he was unable to check if payment had been deducted because his hand-phone battery had gone flat. The Accused wanted the driver to charge his hand-phone so that he could check the phone app but the driver refused. The driver then proceeded to call for the police[^54].

52     When the police came, PW1 kept communicating with the Accused and asking the Accused to pay the fare. The Accused thought his phone app had paid the fare so he asked the police for assistance to charge his hand-phone[^55].

53      With regard to the criminal force charge, the Accused acknowledge that there were a number of bodily contacts between the Accused and PW1 on the night in question. However, the Accused’s explanation of the bodily contacts ae as follows:-

> i.     For the contacts recorded by PW1’s BWC at 23:54:44, 23:54:48, 23:54:51 and 23:54:57 hours, the Accused was scared when PW1 stretched his hands out suddenly and it was the Accused’s natural reaction to stretch out his hand in response. The Accused had no intention to use criminal force on PW1[^56].

> ii.     As for the contact recorded by PW1’s BWC at 23:57:12 hours, the Accused was talking to PW3 when this incident happened. The Accused is trained to give speeches. The Accused was using body language and stretching out his hand when trying to explain to PW3. The Accused was not looking at PW1 and he had touched PW1’s BWC accidentally. The Accused did not touch PW1’s shoulder. If PW1 did not stand so close to the Accused, this incident would not have happened[^57].

> iii.     With regard to the incident captured by PW1’s BWC at 23:59:00, the Accused was talking to PW3 when PW1 suddenly grabbed his right upper arm. This caused the Accused discomfort and the Accused’s natural reaction was to reach out his hand and remove PW1’s hand. The Accused reacted only because PW1 had grabbed him. There was no intention by the Accused to use criminal force on PW1[^58].

> iv.     As for the incident at 00:00:43 hours, the bodily contact between the Accused and PW1 was due to PW1 pushing the Accused until the Accused almost fell. The Accused’s natural reaction was to use his hand in response and to move backward. There was no intention by the Accused to use criminal force on PW1[^59].

> v.     As for the incident at 00:02:12 hours, this happened when the Accused was being handcuffed by PW1. The Accused wanted to cooperate and he had stretched out his hands in front for PW1 to put on the handcuffs. However, PW1 was trying to bring the Accused’s hands to his back in order to handcuff him. The Accused was trying to cooperate with PW1 and there was no intention by the Accused to use criminal force on PW1[^60].

54     As for the disorderly behaviour charge, the Accused denied that he was shouting, gesturing and behaving aggressively continuously from 11.54 pm on 6 December 2017 to 12.04 am on 7 December 2017[^61].

55     The Accused admitted that at certain times, he did speak in a higher than normal volume but he was merely raising his voice to stress his point because PW3 had said the word “Nonsense” and that had triggered him. The Accused idolised Lee Kuan Yew and when PW3 told the Accused he was mistaken, he thought that she was calling Lee Kuan Yew nonsense and he got triggered and he raised his voice[^62].

56     As for the allegation that he had behaved aggressively during the arrest, the Accused deny that he was behaving aggressively during the arrest process. The Accused testified that he had felt pain during PW1 pulled him hands behind his back and the Accused reacted naturally because of the pain. The Accused also testified that he was cooperative with the police and he had placed his hands in front for them to be handcuffed. Although PW1 did tell him to place his hands behind, PW1 did not explain the procedure that he needs to be handcuffed from behind. If the Accused had known this, he would have cooperated with PW1[^63].

57     As for the POHA charge, the Accused said that the words “ Singapore policemen too stupid” was not directed at PW1 but his circumstances[^64].

## e.   My findings of the facts

## On DAC 944757-2017

58      For DAC 944757-2017 (the criminal force charge), the Accused is charged with using force on PW1 by repeatedly pushing his right hand and arm and tapping his right shoulder twice at the Blk 420 Hougang Avenue 10 carpark between 11.54 pm on 6 December 2017 and 12.01 am on 7 December 2017 under section 353 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

59     The relevant sections of the Penal Code are as follows:

> **Force**

> **349**.    A person is said to use force to another if he causes motion, change of motion, or cessation of motion to that other, or if he causes to any substance such motion, or change of motion, or cessation of motion as brings that substance into contact with any part of that other’s body, or with anything which that other is wearing or carrying, or with anything so situated that such contact affects that other’s sense of feeling:

>> Provided that the person causing the motion, or change of motion, or cessation of motion, causes that motion, change of motion, or cessation of motion in one of the following 3 ways:

>>> (a)    by his own bodily power;

>>> (b)    by disposing any substance in such a manner that the motion, or change or cessation of motion, takes place without any further act on his part, or on the part of any other person;

>>> (c)    by inducing any animal to move, to change its motion, or to cease to move.

> **Criminal force**

> **350**.    Whoever intentionally uses force to any person, without that person’s consent, in order to cause the committing of any offence, or intending by the use of such force illegally to cause, or knowing it to be likely that by the use of such force he will illegally cause injury, fear or annoyance to the person to whom the force is used, is said to use criminal force to that other.

60     It is not disputed that PW1 was a public servant who was carrying out his duty at the material time.

61     It is also not disputed that there were bodily contacts between the Accused and PW1 but the Prosecution and the Defence are not in agreement as to the exact number of bodily contacts between the parties. The Prosecution has identified 12 instances of bodily contacts between PW1 and the Accused[^65] while the Defence had submitted that there were only 8 instances of bodily contacts between PW1 and the Accused[^66].

62     Having considered the evidence of all the witnesses and having studied the video recording P2, I would accept the Prosecution’s position that there were 12 instances of bodily contacts between PW1 and the Accused.

63     In the present case, I note that the Defence is not saying that there were no bodily contacts between the Accused and PW1. The Defence is arguing that there was no intention by the Accused to use criminal force on PW1 because all the instances of bodily contacts were accidental or due to the Accused’s natural reaction because he was scared.

64     As such, I agree with the Prosecution’s submission that the main issue here is whether or not the Accused had possessed the necessary mens rea, _i.e._ that he intentionally used criminal force on PW1.

65     In the case of _Muhammad Khalis Bin Ramlee v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 449</span> cited by the Prosecution, Sundaresh Menon CJ had highlighted that actual knowledge can be inferred from the objective acts and circumstances of the offence. It was open to the court to undertake this enquiry by a consideration of the objective circumstances and with reference to what a reasonable person in the position of the accused would have known. _Muhammad Khalis Bin Ramlee v PP_ was a case involving grievous hurt. Sundaresh Menon CJ was of the view that if it was shown that a reasonable person in the accused’s position, having regard to all the facts and circumstances before him, would have known that grievous hurt was likely to result from his acts, then in order for the accused to deny actual knowledge, he would have to prove or explain how and why he did not in fact have such knowledge as the reasonable person would have had (at \[41\] to \[44\]):

> “41    It is also clear that s 322 requires subjective knowledge in contrast to the third state of mind mentioned at \[37(c)\] above, _ie_, _having reason to believe_ that one’s actions are likely to result in a particular consequence, which speaks to objective knowledge. As I have noted at \[38\] above, this is not reflected at all in s 322. The inquiry in this context is purely objective and may, in my view, be seen as analogous to the state of mind that applies in the context of doing something negligently. In such a case, the actor neither intends nor knows that a particular type of consequence will ensue but, objectively, there were reasons that could have caused a reasonable person to have anticipated that. This state of mind equates to the mental element of negligence in s 338 but has no place in s 322.

> 42    Thus, the mental element required for an offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt is that the accused actually intended grievous hurt to result from his actions or knew that it was likely that grievous hurt would so result. The inquiry is as to the accused person’s subjective state of mind. However, there is an important distinction between the specific mental element required by the law for an offence to be made out, which has been discussed in the preceding paragraphs, and the way in which the relevant mental element may be proved by the Prosecution or found by the court. The law may require that the accused possess certain subjective states of mind for the purposes of an offence, but that does not mean that the accused’s intention and knowledge cannot be judged and inferred from his objective conduct and all the surrounding circumstances. Barring a personal admission by the accused, this will often be the only way to ascertain his state of mind. As the Court of Appeal held in _Tan Joo Cheng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1992\] 1 SLR(R) 219</span> at \[12\], intention (and to my mind, knowledge as well) is “pre-eminently a matter for inference”. The same point was made by V K Rajah JA in _Lee Chez Kee_ at \[254\]:

>> Very often, it will not be the case that the accused states that he had a particular state of knowledge. The existence of a state of knowledge is therefore to be carefully inferred from the surrounding evidence. This is not to say that the courts should ‘objectivise’ subjective knowledge with what they think the accused ought to have known; what this simply requires is for a careful evaluation of the evidence to disclose what the accused actually knew but had not stated explicitly. Indeed, this is the entire nature of circumstantial evidence.

> 43    The need to infer intention and knowledge from the objective facts is also well explained in Sri Hari Singh Gour, _Penal Law of India_ vol 3 (Law Publishers (India) Pvt Ltd, 11th Revised Ed, 2011) (“Gour”) at pp 3215–3216, in a passage also accepted and quoted by the court in _Koh Jing Kwang_ (at \[36\]). Commenting on s 322 of the Indian Penal Code 1860 (Act No 45 of 1860) (India) (“the IPC”) which is for all purposes in the same terms as s 322 of the PC, Gour writes:

>> … But there must be evidence that what the accused had intended or known to be likely was not only hurt, but grievous hurt. But how is such intention or knowledge to be proved? This difficulty was suggested to the Law Commissioners who said: _‘The Judge is not to trouble himself with seeking for direct proof of what the offender thought was likely to happen, but is to infer it from the nature of his act_, taking him to have intended grievous hurt, or at least to have contemplated grievous hurt as likely to occur, when he did what everybody knows is likely to cause grievous hurt, and the more certainly drawing this conclusion where there is evidence of previous enmity against the party who has suffered. …’

>> …

>> _This is, of course, the only way in which intention and knowledge can be proved._ Overt act and declarations, the amount of violence used, the nature of the weapon selected for that purpose, the part of the body, vital or otherwise, where the wound was inflicted, the effect produced are, indeed, some of the most essential facts from which the Judge or jury may infer an intention. It cannot be judged from any isolated fact, but must be judged from all together. For, suppose a person strikes a blow with moderate violence, which would not cause death of an ordinary subject, but which owing to the latent disease in him caused his death, the criminality of the act could not obviously be judged by the fatal result, but only by the nature of the act, namely, the severity of the blow. … \[emphasis added\]

> 44    It is thus open to, and often useful for, the court to undertake the inquiry into the accused’s actual knowledge by a consideration of the objective circumstances and with reference to what a reasonable person in the position of the accused would have known. As explained in _Masoud Rahimi bin Mehrzad v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 1 SLR 257</span>, in relation to the accused’s knowledge of the nature of the drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), the reasonable person’s perspective is “one of the evidential tools for the court to assess the accused’s subjective state of mind” (at \[59\]). I consider that the same principles apply in the context of s 322. Practically speaking, therefore, if it is shown that a reasonable person in the accused’s position, having regard to all the facts and circumstances before him, would have known that grievous hurt was likely to result from his acts, then in order for the accused to deny actual knowledge, he would have to prove or explain how and why he _did not in fact_ have such knowledge as the reasonable person would have had.

66     The Defence has submitted that the Prosecution is wrong to have referred to the case of _Muhammad Khalis Bin Ramlee v PP_ because the facts and charges in that case are different from the present case. While I acknowledge that the facts and the charges in the 2 cases are different, I note that the Prosecution is relying on _Muhammad Khalis Bin Ramlee v PP_ for the principle of law that a court can infer actual knowledge from the objective acts and circumstances of the offence. As such, I do not agree with the Defence that _Muhammad Khalis Bin Ramlee v PP_ has no relevance to our present case.

## Whether the Accused has the intention to use criminal force on PW1

67     Having looked at the video footage of PW1’s BWC footage, I am of the view that PW1 and PW3 are credible witnesses. They are police officers who were just carrying out their duties and I would agree with the Prosecution that there is no reason for them to lie or exaggerate their testimonies.

68     I agree with the Prosecution that the video evidence show that the Accused was not cooperative with the police officers and he was refusing to give them his particulars and also not amenable to their proposal to resolve the matter by going up to his home to get money or to get his family members to help pay for the fare[^67].

69     The video evidence also showed that the 2 officers were trying to resolve matter between the Accused and the taxi driver in an amicable manner. The officers had repeatedly asked for the Accused’s address and particulars in a calm and professional manner and had suggested the Accused to go to his unit to get money to pay the taxi driver but the Accused was not agreeable to the same. Even after the officers had informed the Accused that they were going to bring him back to the police station for disorderly behaviour (at 23:59:35 hours), they were still prepared to give him a chance when the Accused asked for a chance. When this happened, PW1 again asked the Accused for his address and PW3 suggested to the Accused to go to his unit to get money to pay the taxi driver but the Accused refused to do either[^68].

70     It is also clear from the video footage that the Accused was adamant on only getting his hand-phone charged and was not open to any other options which were suggested to him.

71     The video recording also captured the Accused pushing and grabbing PW1’s hand and arm despite PW1 repeatedly telling the Accused not to touch him[^69]. This clearly show that the Accused is aware that his action is causing annoyance to PW1 but he is not bothered as to how PW1 is feeling.

72     The Defence submitted that the Accused had used his hand in response to PW1 sudden stretching of his hand on 4 occasions because he was scared[^70]. The Defence submitted that it was the Accused’s natural response to counter the stretch hand[^71]. I do not accept the Defence’s submission because the video footage clearly captured the Accused’s conduct and demeanour and it clearly showed him behaving in an aggressive manner. There was no fear or distress shown on the part of the Accused shown in the video footage[^72]. The video footage also clearly show that PW1 did not stretch his hand towards the Accused suddenly and that PW1 was behaving appropriately at all times and there is no need for the Accused to feel fearful and have to protect himself[^73].

73     As for the 2 taps on PW1’s shoulder, PW1 had given evidence that he had felt the taps on his shoulders. The Defence’s position is that the act was accidental because the Accused was stretching his hands to express himself and PW1 was standing too close to him. The Defence is also saying that the Accused did not tap PW1’s shoulder but he merely touched PW1’s BWC[^74]. This is contradicted by PW3’s evidence. PW3 had testified that she saw the Accused touch PW1’s shoulder. The Defence, in their Reply by Defence on the Prosecution’s Submission, had also pointed out that while the Accused did momentarily look at PW1 when he tapped the BWC, the Accused was drunk and was not focusing on PW1 when he did that[^75]. I do not agree with the Defence’s submission on this point. The video recording clearly show that the Accused was looking at PW1 when his hands reached out to tap PW1’s shoulder and the 2 taps were not light taps but targeted taps with quite a lot of force used[^76]. As such, I would reject the Accused’s evidence that the he did not tap PW1’s shoulder twice and that he only accidentally touched PW1’s BWC.

74     With regard to the incident at 23:59:00, the Accused’s position is that it was a natural reaction from the Accused because he felt discomfort after PW1 had grabbed his arm[^77]. The video recording showed the Accused moving towards PW3 in an aggressive manner after she had told him “we have given you many chances”[^78]. PW1 sensing that this may become a dangerous situation, moved in between the 2 of them and held onto the Accused’s arm. The Accused then pushed PW1’s hand away. The Accused’s demeanour as captured on the video did not show any discomfort or distress on his face. I am not minded to accept the Accused’s version of the events.

75     As for the bodily contacts when PW1 was trying to handcuff the Accused, it is clear from the video recording that the Accused was aggressive and defiant when the PW1 and PW3 were trying to place the handcuffs on him. Both the police officers repeatedly asked him to place his hands behind his body but the Accused had refused to comply with their instructions. The Accused kept insisting that he be handcuffed from the front and the 2 officers had no alternative but to use reasonable force to place the Accused’s hands behind his back in order to handcuff him.

76     I also agree with the Prosecution’s submission that it is evident from the video recording that the Accused’s overall behaviour, which included the taking off his jacket, insisting the police officers to charge his phone, refusing to answer their questions, shouting and gesturing, and even asking PW1 to shake his hand, was not the behaviour of someone who was afraid. I am of the view that the Accused’s behaviour clearly shows his disregard and defiance for the police officers.

77     It is also clear from the video recording that the Accused was behaving aggressively towards PW3 as he had moved towards her and had leaned towards her and causing her to take a step back. This prompted PW1 to move in to tell the Accused to “_keep your distance_”[^79]. PW1 even had to call to his station to request for assistance because “_subject hostile_”[^80].

78     Having considered the evidence before me, I am of the view that the Accused’s overall conduct and surrounding circumstances show that he had every intention of using criminal force on PW1.

79     The Defence has also submitted that even if the Accused had used force on PW1, the amount of force used is very minimal as PW1 did not feel much force used on him.

80     Section 349 of the Penal Code states that “a person is said to use force to another if he causes motion, change of motion, or cessation of motion to that other, or if he causes to any substance such motion, or change of motion, or cessation of motion as brings that substance into contact with any part of that other’s body, or with anything which that other is wearing or carrying, or with anything so situated that such contact affects that other’s sense of feeling”.

81     It is clear from section 349 that the force applied need not be one which is forceful so long as the contact can affect the other person’s sense of feeling. As defined by section 349, so long as the PW1 can feel the touch, it would constitute “force” under section 349. In the present case, it is clear that the bodily contacts between the Accused and PW1 would constitute “force” under section 349.

## On MAC 900758-2018

82      As regards to MAC 900758-2018 (the disorderly behaviour charge), the relevant provision of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order & Nuisance) Act is as follows:

> **Riotous, disorderly or indecent behaviour in, or in the immediate vicinity of, certain places**

> **20**.    Any person who is found guilty of an riotous, disorderly or indecent behaviour in any public road or public place or place of public amusement or resort, or in the immediate vicinity of, or in, any court, public office, police station or place of worship, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.

83     In the present case, both PW1 and PW3 had given evidence in court that they had observed the Accused shouting, gesturing and behaving aggressively at the carpark of Blk 420 Hougang Avenue 10, which is a public place. Both the police officers also noted that the Accused was doing this around the midnight hour and the Accused’s behaviours was attracting the attention of passers-by, and residents from the neighbouring blocks of flats were also looking out of their windows at the commotion.

84     The Accused’s behaviour was also captured by PW1’s BWC’s video which recorded the Accused shouting, gesturing and behaving aggressively from the period between 23:54:55 to 00:05:59 hours[^81].

85     The Accused’s also behaviour clearly show his disregard for the police officers who were present at the scene.

86     The Accused’s defence is that he had not shouted, gestured, and behaved aggressively, _continuously_ between 11.47pm on 6 December 2017 to 12.04am on 7 December 2017 and therefore the charge is not made out[^82].

87     I would agree with the Prosecution that the Defence is playing with semantics. It is clear from the evidence that was presented that the Accused was shouting, gesturing and behaving aggressively on and off throughout the whole period and even though he was not doing it continuously, I am of the view that the charge is made up as the Accused’s action did disrupt public peace.

88     The Defence also submitted that the Accused did at certain times speak in a higher than normal volume but he was merely raising his voice to stress his point as PW3 had said the word “Nonsense” and that had triggered him. The Accused idolised Lee Kuan Yew and when PW3 told the Accused he was mistaken, he thought that she was calling Lee Kuan Yew nonsense and he got triggered and he raised his voice. This to me cannot be an excuse for the Accused. Even in this situation, the video recording had captured the Accused not just raising his voice but also shouting, gesturing and behaving aggressively. By his actions, the Accused was clearly behaving in a disorderly behaviour.

## On MAC 900849-2018

89      As for MAC 900849-2018 (the POHA charge), the Defence’s position is that the words uttered were not aimed at PW1 and it was targeted at the circumstances.

90     The Accused did not deny uttering the phrase: “_Xin jia po you ni men zhe zhong_ policemen, too stupid” in Mandarin which translated to mean “Singapore has policemen like you all, too stupid.” The Accused’s position is that it was not directed at PW1 and that he was merely expressing his grievances in general.

91     I agree with the Prosecution that the objective evidence do not support the Defence’s position:

> (a)     It is clear from the BWC recording that the Accused was looking at PW1 when he was uttering the phrase[^83].

> (b)     It is very clear that the Accused was responding to PW1 when he uttered those words. The relevant part of the trancripts are as follows[^84]:-

>   
| 

_“PW1:_

 | 

_Okay, you sit down down first, okay_

 |
| 

_Accused:_

 | 

_You don’t tell me sit down. I think fucking Singapore has you this type of policeman, too stupid._

 |
| 

_PW1:_

 | 

_Okay, okay, it’s all right, it’s all right, okay”_

 |

  
  

> (c)     PW3 also gave evidence that the Accused was referring to PW1 when he said the relevant words[^85].

> (d)     It is also clear from PW1’s BWC recording that this was not the only occasion the Accused had insulted PW1 and PW3 on the night of the incident. I note that there were at least 6 other instances where the Accused has insulted the 2 police officers at the scene by calling them stupid, useless or being afraid[^86].

92     From the evidence, I would agree with the Prosecution that the words spoken by the Accused are aimed/targeted at PW1.

93     The relevant provisions of the POHA are as follows :-

> **Threatening, abusing or insulting public servant or public service worker**

> **6.(1**)    No one shall by any means-

>> (a)    use any indecent, threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour; or

>> (b)    make any indecent, threatening, abusive or insulting communication, towards or to a public servant or public service officer (referred to for the purposes of this section as the victim) in relation to the execution of the victim’s duty as such public servant or public service worker.

> (2)    No offence is committed under this section unless the person knows or ought reasonably to know that the victim was acting in his capacity as a public servant or public service worker, as the case may be.

> (3)    Any person who contravenes subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence and, subject to section 8, shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.

> (4)    In any proceedings for an offence under subsection (3), it is a defence for the accused to prove –

>> (a)    that he had no reason to believe that the words or behaviour used, or the communication made, by him would be heard, seen or otherwise perceived by the victim; or

>> (b)    that his conduct was reasonable.

> (5)    In this section –

>> “public servant” has the same meaning as in the Penal Code (Cap 224), and includes any person who, by virtue of any other written law, is deemed to be a public servant for the purposes of the Penal Code;

>> “public service worker” means an individual who belongs to a prescribed class of employees or workers that provides any service which is essential to the well-being of the public or the proper functioning of Singapore, as prescribed under subsection (6).

> (6)    For the purposes of the definition of “public service worker” in subsection (5), the Minister may, by order publish in the Gazette, prescribe the classes of employees or workers and the services provided by them.

> (7)    Every order under subsection (6) shall be presented to Parliament as soon as possible after publication in the Gazette.

94     In the present case, the words “Singapore has policemen like you all, too stupid.” are clearly insulting in nature. It is also very clear that PW1 is a public servant who is carry out his public duty and the Accused is aware of the PW1’s status. I am also of the view that there is no evidence raised by the Accused to allow him to rely on the defence which is provided in section 6(4)(a) and (b) of POHA.

## F.   Conviction

95     Having considered all the evidence before me, I am satisfied that the Prosecution has proven its case against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt and I convicted the Accused accordingly of all the 3 charges.

## G.   Antecedent

96     The Accused was untraced for any criminal antecedent.

## H.   Sentence

97     I now turn to the issue of the appropriate sentence to be imposed on the 3 charges.

## a.   Prosecution’s Submission on Sentence[^87]

98     The Prosecution had sought a sentence of at least 5 weeks’ imprisonment in respect of criminal force charge under section 353 of the Penal Code. With regard to the disorderly behaviour charge and the POHA charge, the Prosecution was not seeking for any custodial sentence for these 2 charges and they were prepared to leave the appropriate amount of fine to the determined by the Court.

99     For the section 353 charge, the Prosecution submitted that the dominant sentencing principle to be applied to this case is one of general deterrence. It is trite that in cases of assault against police officers, general deterrence is the dominant sentencing principle.

100    The Prosecution also referred me to the case of _PP v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 306</span> (“_Jeffrey Yeo_”). In highlighting the need to deter such offences, the High Court in _Jeffrey Yeo_ stated as follows:

> a.     There has been a steady increase in the total number of cases of physical and verbal abuse, and in particular a “sharp increase in the incidents of verbal abuse in 2016.”[^88]

> b.     Challenges to the authority of the police pose a real risk of defensive policing. It would be unfortunate and undesirable if police officers feel the need too easily and too often to draw their weapons or to use force in reaction to any perceived danger.[^89]

> c.     Police officers must be assured of adequate protection and vindication by the law against behaviour that might compromise the effective discharge of their duties.[^90]

101    The Prosecution had pointed out that while _Jeffrey Yeo_ involved an offence under Section 332 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224) for slapping a police officer, the High Court’s reasoning above shows that general deterrence would apply with equal force to _all_ challenges to police authority. The Prosecution therefore submitted that acts of criminal force to police officers should also be similarly sternly dealt with.

102    The Prosecution submitted that even minor acts of verbal abuse or assault have been be firmly dealt with by the courts. In this regard, guidance may be taken from the learned District Judge’s comments in _PP v Walter Marcel Christoph_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGDC 305</span>, which also involved a Section 353 offence (the offender was sentenced to 5 weeks’ imprisonment for slapping a police officer):

> _“22_      _At a wider level, police authority needs to be vigorously upheld given its significance in any society. The whittling away of police authority is a potential wasting disease in any community. Of course, it will be a gross exaggeration to say that isolated and easily contained acts of unruliness lead to such consequences. But, if offences against police officers that undermine police authority are seen to be tolerated, there is the danger of these acts becoming more widespread and police authority becoming increasingly disregarded, with serious implications._

> _23_      _Flowing from the above, firm reinforcement of police authority must be carried out whenever it is undermined or appears to be undermined. This calls for a robust response to be seen to be taken in dealing with such offences against police officers acting in the course of their duty. This robust response does not lie in the hands of the police, lest they be accused of acting with vested interest or vindictiveness._

> _24_      _While the police must ensure that their authority is exercised in a measured and appropriate manner, it is for the courts to uphold the sense of police authority each time it is undermined and send out a fitting message in the public interest. Doing so ensures that public regard for the police is not diminished, police effectiveness is upheld and law and order continues to be preserved. \[Emphasis added\] “_

## b.   Aggravating Factors

103    The Prosecution had pointed out that the following aggravating factors were present in this case:

> i.     The Accused showed clear disregard of authority. Not only did he fail to heed PW1’s instructions to him to quieten down and listen to him, he used criminal force toward PW1 by pushing his hand and arm away and even tapped PW1 on the shoulder. This was not a one-off act of criminal force as the Accused made contact with PW1 repeatedly, no less than 12 times, despite being told to stop it. While the force used was not excessive, the Accused’s wholly unnecessary actions clearly show that he was wilfully defiant and was deliberately _undermining_ PW1’s authority.

> ii.     The Accused also made it difficult for the police officers to arrest him by struggling and refusing to put his hands behind his back. It took about four minutes for the Accused to be handcuffed, during which time the Accused subjected the officers to a slew of verbal abuse. In _Walter Marcel Christoph_, the court regarded the fact that the offender resisted arrest as an aggravating factor as it “further demonstrated his sense of aggressiveness and brazen defiance against the police officers at the scene.”[^91]

> iii.     The Accused behaved belligerently for a prolonged period of time. The Accused was persistently demanding and uncooperative. He insisted on paying the taxi fare through his phone despite being fully aware that his phone had no battery, and rejected all suggestions from the police officers to find an alternative mode of payment. The incident as a whole lasted more than 15 minutes from the time the police arrived at 11.47pm to 12.04am when the Accused was handcuffed.

> iv.     During this time the Accused was essentially creating a scene at the carpark, shouting, behaving in a disorderly manner, and disturbing the public peace in a residential neighbourhood late at night. This is despite being given ample opportunity and multiple warnings to calm down. In fact, a decision was only made to arrest the accused after more than 10 minutes of trying to convince him to make payment of the taxi fare and go home.

> v.     PW1 noticed that the Accused “smelled strongly of alcohol” and was “a bit drunk”. This is clearly supported by the BWC video recording. At a belated stage, post-conviction, the Accused has obtained a psychiatric report from Dr YC Lim. Essentially, Dr Lim’s opinion is that the Accused was intoxicated at the time of the offences and that his culpability for the offence was adversely affected by his alcohol intoxication. It is well-established that voluntary intoxication is an aggravating factor and Dr Lim’s report therefore does not assist in the Accused’s mitigation[^92]. Voluntary intoxication leading to the commission of offences is a recognised aggravating factor.

104    The Prosecution had also tendered a Table of Sentencing Precedents in support of their sentencing position[^93]. The precedents show that the Court have consistently meted out sentences of between 3 to 5 weeks for section 353 offences involving the offenders who had pleaded guilty and were untraced, who had used criminal force on police officers by pushing them or pushing their hands away and where there was no injury caused to the victims.

105    In the present case, the Prosecution was of the view that the Accused had expressed no remorse in deciding to claim trial in the light of clear BWC footages capturing the offences and the Prosecution had submitted that 5 weeks’ imprisonment was appropriate on the facts of this case for the section 353 offence.

## c.   Mitigation Plea

106    The Defence has highlighted the following mitigating factors on the part of the Accused[^94]:

> i.     The Accused is a young offender. He was 28 years old at the time of his offence. He had completed in NUS degree in the same year of the offences.

> ii.     The Accused is a 1st offender. He has had a clean record before this one-off isolated incident. There is low chance of his re-offending.

> iii.     The Accused is a person of good character and he does not have a reputation of violent behaviour. The acts that he had committed were totally out of his usual character.

> iv.     The Accused is a person with entrepreneur spirit and leadership quality. He was the founding director of Vaster New Media & Business Consultancy Pte Ltd at the age of 27 years old and he incorporated the company 2 years before his graduation from NUS. He is currently operating 2 businesses that employs 15 employees.

> v.     The Accused has cooperated fully with the authorities in their investigation.

> vi.     The Accused is remorseful for his action.

> vii.     The Accused had no intention to use criminal force on PW1. He did not “stomp, slap, kick, assault or spit on the police officer” and the degree of force used is minimal. Also there was no harm caused to PW1 as PW1 confirmed he did not suffer any injury.

> viii.     The Accused’s company, Vaster New Media & Business Consultancy Pte Ltd has helped the Singapore Police Force in promoting awareness to prevent the Chinese speaking members of public from being scammed by fraudsters.

> ix.     The Accused is a kind person who regularly contributes both his time and monies to local charities. He also takes part in local associations and societies in their activities locally. He has also contributed monies to local charities through his company and have received letters of appreciation from these charities.

> x.     The Accused is the sole earning member and breadwinner of the family.

> xi.     The Accused is and hopes to be a useful member of the society. He is an active member of a few local organisations

> xii.     The Accused has also enclosed and attached numerous character referrals/testimonials in his Submissions on Sentence by the Defence and the Plea in Mitigation which attest of his fine qualities and good character.

> xiii.     The Defence had also tendered the psychiatric report of Dr Lim Yun Chin[^95] where Dr Lim opined that the Accused was “overly under the influence of alcohol intoxication” and “his culpability for the alleged offence has been adversely affected by his alcohol intoxication”.

107    The Defence also disagreed with the Prosecution’s submission on the aggravating factors present in this case[^96]:

> i.     The Defence was of the view that there was no disregard of authority by the Accused as it is clear from the evidence that he was offering a handshake to PW1 and he had offered to go back to the police station with the police officers.

> ii.     The Defence also submitted that the Accused’s action was a one-off incident as the tappings did not happen over a long period of time or space, rather they are part of one transaction.

> iii.     The Defence further disagreed with the Prosecution’s submission that the Accused had made it difficult for the police officers to arrest him by struggling and refusing to put his hands behind his back. The Defence was of the view that this is due to a misunderstanding in the Accused’s mind due to lack of clear instruction from PW1 for the Accused to place his hand behind his back.

108    I do not agree with the Defence’s submission in paragraph 107 above. I am of the view that all these factors highlighted by the Defence relates to my finding of facts and I have considered and given my views on the same in the earlier part of my judgment when I convicted the Accused of the 3 charges.

109    On the issue of voluntarily intoxication, the Defence was of the view that although voluntary intoxication is regarded as an aggravating factor, the Court must give consideration to the fact that the Accused was not a regular drinker and his intoxication was one-off and an uncharacteristic incident in his life[^97].

## d.   Defence’s Submission on Sentence

110    On the issue of sentencing, the Defence had submitted that the offences are not very serious and the Accused’s culpability is low. The Defence had also urged me to call for pre-sentence report with a view towards to probation. In this regard, the Defence had referred me to a number of cases involving young adults where the courts have ordered probation[^98].

111    In the alternative, if I am not minded to call for a pre-sentence report, the Defence was of the view that the custodial threshold has not been crossed in relation to the criminal force charge because the degree of force that was used on PW1 was low and the Accused’s acts were totally out of character. Given these, the Defence was of the view that specific deterrence could be met by the imposition of a high fine for the criminal force charge. The Defence has also referred me to a number of precedents whereby fines have been imposed by the Courts for a section 353 charge[^99].

112    The Defence was the view that the following sentences would be sufficient to send the signal to the Accused of his wrongdoings:

> i.     $10,000 fine for the criminal force charge;

> ii.     $700 fine for the disorderly behaviour charge; and

> iii.     $2,500 fine for the POHA charge.

## e.   Whether to call for a pre-sentence report

113    I note that the Accused was 29 years old at the time of the commissioning of the offences and that he is now 31 years old. At the time of the commissioning of the offences, the Accused cannot be considered a youthful offender.

114    As pointed out by the Honourable Chief Justice Menon in _A Karthik v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 1289</span> (“_Karthik_”) at \[32\] - \[34\]:-

> “32    It is clear from the language of section 5(1) (of the Probation of Offenders Act) that there is no aged-based restriction as to whether the court is permitted to make a probation order, so long as the offender does not fall within the proviso to that provision (in other words, so long as the offender is not convicted of an offence for which a specific minimum sentence or mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment or fine or caning is prescribed by law): _Goh Lee Yin v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 1 SLR (R) 530</span> (“_Goh Lee Yin_”) at \[26\].

> 33.    That said, the age of an offender is nonetheless a critical factor in the court’s determination of whether an offender should be granted probation in lieu of imprisonment. This is because probation as a sentencing option places rehabilitation at the front and centre of the court’s deliberation (_Public Prosecutor v Koh Wen Jie Boaz_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 1 SLR 334</span> (“_Boaz Koh”_) at \[35\], citing _Public Prosecutor v Mohannad Al-Ansari bin Basri_ \[2008\] 1 SLR (R) 449 (“_Al-Ansari”_) at \[41\] – \[43\]), and rehabilitation as a sentencing principle generally takes precedence when the court is dealing with youthful offenders (_Public Prosecutor v Lim Chee Yin Jordon_ \[2018\] SHGC 46 (“_Jordon Lim”_) at \[30\], citing _Public Prosecutor v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice_ \[1998\] 3 SLR (R) (“_Maurice Mok”_) at \[21\]). Indeed, the law takes a _presumptive_ view that where youthful offenders are concerned, the primary sentencing consideration is rehabilitation: _Public Prosecutor v Lim Cheng Ji Alvin_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 671</span> (“_Alvin Lim”_) at \[6\], cited in _Jordon Lim_ at \[3\].

> 34.     **In contrast, the presumption that the dominant sentencing consideration is rehabilitation does** **_not_** **apply to adult offenders, that is to say, offenders who are above the age of 21:** **_Alvin Lim_** **at \[7\]. Instead, rehabilitation would only be regarded as the operative consideration when sentencing adult offenders if the particular offender concerned “demonstrates an** **_extremely strong propensity for reform_** **and/or there are** **_exceptional circumstances warranting the grant of probation_** **” \[emphasis added\]:** **_Goh Lee Yin_** **at \[28\], cited in** **_Jordan Lim_** **at \[33\]. In short, the archetype of the appropriate candidate for probation is the young amateur” offender (** **_Sim Wen Yi Ernest v Public Prosecutor_** **<span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 207</span> (“** **_Ernest Sim_** **”) at \[27\], citing** **_Lim Li Ling v Public Prosecutor_** **<span class="citation">\[2007\] 1 SLR(R) 165</span> at \[87\]). As against this, it is “the exception rather than the norm for adult offenders to be sentenced to probation” (** **_Jordan Lim_** **at \[34\]).** (emphasis mine).

115    In the present case, the Accused is an adult offender at the time of the commissioning of the offences **and the presumption that the dominant sentencing consideration does not apply to adult offenders unless the adult offender demonstrates an extremely strong propensity for reform or there are exceptional circumstances warranting the grant of probation.**

116    The issue of whether to call for a probation report for adult offenders was also considered by See Kee Onn J in _GCO v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 31</span> at \[32\] – \[34\]:-

> “32    I turn then to examine whether probation can be ordered. I recently touched on the relevant principles concerning when probation should be ordered in my decision in _Public Prosecutor v Lim Chee Yin Jordon_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 1294</span> (“_Jordon Lim_”). In brief, probation responds to the principle of rehabilitation and can only be justified where rehabilitation is the dominant sentencing principle: _Jordon Lim_ at \[29\]. Rehabilitation as a sentencing principle will presumptively take precedence where young offenders are involved, seeing as they are in their formative years and have better prospects of being reformed: _Jordon Lim_ at \[30\]–\[31\].

> 33    That being said, adult offenders above 21 years of age can still be sentenced to probation, although this would be the exception rather than the norm. Indeed, in _Sim Wen Yi Ernest v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 207</span>, I noted at \[28\] that older offenders might in fact “be more receptive to probation as they are generally more mature and better able to understand their responsibilities, the consequences of breaching probation, and the significance of being afforded a chance for reform”.

> 34     **What is required, however, is that the offender demonstrate an extremely strong propensity for reform, or that there be exceptional circumstances warranting the grant of probation**: _Jordon Lim_ at \[33\], citing _Goh Lee Yin v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 1 SLR(R) 530</span> (“_Goh Lee Yin_”). **Moreover, even if rehabilitation is found to apply, it can be displaced by the need for deterrence. Deterrence would become relatively more prominent, and rehabilitation correspondingly less so, if the offence is serious or the harm caused is severe, amongst other considerations:** **_Jordon Lim_** **at \[35\].** Rehabilitation would come to the fore, and deterrence recede in significance, if the offender suffers from a mental condition causally linked to the commission of the offence: _Jordon Lim_ at \[37\].”

117    Applying the above principles to the facts of the present case, the Accused was 29 years old when he committed the offences. In the present case, the Accused had taken the position that he was not guilty of the 3 charges in the face of clear evidence from the BWC video footage and had claimed trial to all 3 charges. The Accused was found guilty of all 3 charges after 4 days of trial. This clearly show his lack of remorse in the present case. As such, I am of the view that the Accused has not demonstrated any “extremely strong propensity for reform”, or has shown any “exceptional circumstances” justifying the imposition of probation.

118    As for the cases referred to by the Defence on the granting of probation, I would agree with the Prosecution[^100] that these cases can be easily distinguishable:

> a.      _PP v Muhammad Saiful bin Jamal Shariff_ – the offender was below 21 years old at the time.

> b.      _Tommy Koh Leng Theng v PP_ – the citation in the mitigation plea, <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGMC 47</span>, is actually the grounds of decision for a charge of _affray_, in which the court noted that the offender had been sentenced to probation in 1996 for a Section 353 offence. In 1996 the offender was below 21 years old.

> c.     The majority of the other cases referred to by the defence are cases that pre-date _Jeffrey Yeo_ and does not reflect the present state of the law.

I also note that all the accused in the cases cited have pleaded guilty to the offences and they did not claim trial to the charges.

## f.   Sentence Imposed

119    In the present case, I agree with the Prosecution’s position in paragraph 103 above that the aggravating factors are present in this case. I also accept that the Accused was intoxicated through his own means. The Accused’s own psychiatrist report clearly states that the Accused was overtly under the influence of alcohol intoxication. Self-induced intoxication is clearly an aggravating factor. I also agree with the Prosecution submission that the Accused has shown no remorse by choosing to fight the charge in the face of clear evidence from the BWC video footage.

120    I cannot accept the Defence’s submission on the issue of voluntary intoxication. If the Accused is aware of the fact that he cannot drink and is unable to hold his alcohol, he should stay away from drinking. He cannot choose to drink excessively on his own accord and rely on the fact that he is easily intoxicated to absolve him from any wrongdoings or to get out of trouble. In my view, the fact that the Accused chose to drink excessively knowing that he is not able to hold his drinks clearly makes his conduct more culpable and this is an aggravating factor.

121    In relation to the section 353 criminal force charge, police officers are front line public servants whose duty is to keep our country safe and they should be protected from any form of harm or assault from any would be offender. In this case, I agree with the Prosecution that the relevant sentencing principle to be applied to the section 353 criminal force charge should be general deterrence.

122    In the present case, given the aggravating factors, I am of the view that the custodial threshold has been crossed. And having considered all the circumstances, I would agree with the Prosecution that a sentence of 5 weeks’ imprisonment is appropriate for the section 353 criminal force charge.

123    As for the disorderly behaviour charge and the POHA charge, I note that the usual sentencing tariff for such offences are usually fines. As such, I am imposing a fine of $2,000 in default 2 weeks’ imprisonment for the disorderly behaviour charge and a fine of $3,000 in default 3 weeks’ imprisonment for the POHA charge.

124    Having considered the Prosecution’s address on sentence and the Defence’s mitigation plea, I imposed the following sentences on the Accused:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr"><colgroup><col width="15.5%"> <col width="37.8%"> <col width="46.7%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>S/No.</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge No.</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentence</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 944757-2017</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5 weeks’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">MAC 900758-2018</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$2000 fine in default 2 weeks’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">MAC 900849-2018</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$3000 fine in default 3 weeks’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Total Sentence:</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5 weeks’ imprisonment and $5,000 fine in default 5 weeks’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

125    The Accused has filed his Notice of Appeal against my decision. He has applied for and has been granted a stay of execution of the imprisonment term pending his appeal. The Accused is currently out on bail in the sum of $10,000 pending appeal.
