20 September 2019

### District Judge Luke Tan:

## (1)   Introduction

1       The use of WhatsApp to send messages and photographs has become ubiquitous in this day and age. With the click of a “send” button, such information can be transmitted instantaneously, uninhibited by geographical distance and borders, and often to large numbers of recipients. Once received, the information can be forwarded to yet countless others, and also be posted on social media sites. Like a genie out of a bottle, once released, such information sometimes takes on a life of its own.

2       In the present case, the accused, Fazli Hisham Bin Mohd Fairuz Shah, a 29-year-old male Singaporean, received confidential information – in the form of photographs – that he was not authorised to receive. The photographs had been obtained from his girlfriend, PW1 Nurizzah Afiqah binte Hussain (Nurizzah), who was a paramedic with Unistrong, an outsourced company engaged by the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF). One of the photographs showed part of a SCDF Call Sheet, with various pieces of information visible, including details of a maid attempting suicide at the premises of a named condominium. Another photograph showed a lady hanging from a ceiling fan with a rope around her neck.

3       The accused subsequently forwarded the above two photographs to a WhatsApp chat group, consisting of 31 members including himself. One of the other members of the chat group, in turn, forwarded the same two photographs to three other domestic helpers in Singapore, one of whom posted them on her Facebook account. Thereafter, the two photographs circulated on social media.

4       The accused was prosecuted for his actions. He claimed trial to two charges under section 5(1)(c)(i) punishable under section 17(2) of the Official Secrets Act (OSA). Both alleged offences were committed on the same date and time. The charges read:

> 1st Charge (Amended)

> "You are charged that you, on 1 February 2017 at about 9.50pm in Singapore, did communicate to persons in a WhatsApp chat group named "Hijau, kuning dan merah", without authorization, a photograph of a Singapore Civil Defence Force Call Sheet, ![]([2019] SGDC 0190_Image/[2019] SGDC 0190_image1.jpeg)which photograph was in your possession and which you obtained from one Nurizzah Afiqah binte Hussain, who had forwarded the said photograph to you in contravention of the Official Secrets Act (Cap 213, 2012 Rev Ed), and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 5(1)(c)(i), punishable under Section 17(2) of the said Act."

> 2nd Charge (Amended)

> "You are charged that you, on 1 February 2017 at about 9.50pm in Singapore, did communicate to persons in WhatsApp chat group named ""Hijau, kuning dan merah", without authorization, a photograph of a deceased person XXX hanging from a ![]([2019] SGDC 0190_Image/[2019] SGDC 0190_image2.jpeg)ceiling fan, which photograph was in your possession and which you obtained from one Nurizzah Afiqah binte Hussain, who had forwarded the said photograph to you in contravention of the Official Secrets Act (Cap 213, 2012 Rev Ed), and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 5(1)(c)(i), punishable under Section 17(2) of the said Act.”

5       Most of the facts of the case were not disputed. In addition, parties tendered a Statement of Agreed Facts (SOAF), with various documents annexed. These included the accused’s long statement and a cautioned statement, both of which were admitted into evidence without challenge as to voluntariness. The central issue in the case was essentially whether the mens rea element of the alleged offences had been made out.

6       At the end of the trial, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt and I convicted him accordingly.

7       Following his conviction, and after considering sentencing submissions, I imposed a fine of $1,500 (in default 1 week’s imprisonment) per charge on the accused, for a total fine of $3,000 (in default 2 weeks’ imprisonment). The accused has since paid his fine.

8       On 3 September 2019, the accused filed an appeal against his conviction. As no appeal has been filed by either party against the sentence imposed, my grounds of decision will essentially only deal with the issue of conviction.

## (2)   The Undisputed Facts

9       The essential undisputed facts, as extracted from the SOAF, are reproduced below:

> (a)     On 1 February 2017, the accused's girlfriend, Nurizzah Afiqah Binte Hussain ("Nurizzah"), was employed by Unistrong Technology (S) Pte Ltd ("Unistrong") as a paramedic.

> (b)     Between 6.57 pm and 7.02 pm on 1 February 2017, Nurizzah received a document containing the printed words "MAID HUNG HERSELF ON THE FAN. WE WERE OVERSEA FOR 5 DAYS" (sic). She took a photograph of part of the document, capturing the words '"MAID HUNG HERSELF ON THE FAN. WE WERE OVERSEA FOR 5 DAYS".

> (c)     The document and the photograph of the document were in her possession and were obtained by her owing to her position as an employee of Unistrong Technology (S) Pte Ltd.

> (d)     At about 7.02 pm on the same day, she communicated the photograph of part of the document to the accused, by sending the photograph to him via WhatsApp Messenger ("WhatsApp"), a mobile phone application. **_Her act of sending the photograph to the Accused contravened s 5(1)(e)(i) of the Official Secrets Act ("OSA") and she was convicted accordingly on 7 August 2018._** Screenshots of the relevant messages between Nurizzah and the accused dated 1 February 2017 were annexed to the SOAF.

> (e)     Subsequently, Nurizzah and her team arrived at the incident location. They were brought to a room where the deceased, XXX, was found hanging from a fan. Nurizzah's colleague, Shaik Haziq Fahmi Bin Shaik Nasair Johar ("Haziq"), used his mobile phone to take a photograph of the deceased.

> (f)     Nurizzah obtained the photograph of the deceased from Haziq, who had communicated the photograph of the deceased to the WhatsApp chat group "STN21 ", of which she was a member. Haziq had obtained the photograph of the deceased owing to his position as a person employed under Unistrong, and he had no authorisation or duty to communicate the photograph of the deceased to the members of the WhatsApp chat group "STN21".

> (g)     At about 8.19 pm that day, Nurizzah communicated the photograph of the deceased to the accused, by sending the photograph to him via WhatsApp. **_Her act of sending the photograph to the accused contravened s 5(1)(c)(i) of the OSA and she was convicted accordingly on 7 August 2018_**. Nurizzah also sent the accused a photograph of the Visitor's Vehicle Pass that was issued by The Makena when she and her team attended at the scene.

> (h)     On 1 February 2017, at about 9.50pm in Singapore, the accused communicated the photographs of the document and the deceased to persons in the WhatsApp chat group named "hijau, kuning dan merah", by forwarding the photographs received from Nurizzah to the WhatsApp group. The WhatsApp chat group "hijau, kuning dan merah" contained 31 members, including the accused. They were the accused's friends and acquaintances. Screenshots of the relevant messages in the Whatsapp chat group named "hijau, kuning dan merah" dated 1 February 2017 were annexed to the SOAF.

> (i)     A member of the WhatsApp chat group "hijau, kuning dan merah", Muhammad Ariff Bin Kamis, forwarded the two photographs to three other domestic helpers in Singapore. Subsequently, one of those domestic helpers posted the photographs on her Facebook account. Thereafter, the two photographs circulated on social media.

> (j)     On 4 February 2017 at 12.56 a.m., a statement was recorded from the accused under Section 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68, 2012 Rev. Ed.) by Inspector Ho Hsien Yeow. The making of the statement was done voluntarily by the accused and was not caused by any inducement, threat or promise.

> (k)     On 21 December 2017 at 11.57 a.m., a statement was recorded from the accused under Section 23 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68, 2012 Rev. Ed.) by Inspector Yeo Qi Eunice. The making of the statement was done voluntarily by the accused and was not caused by any inducement, threat or promise.

> (l)     A Police Report (G/20170203/2192) was lodged on 3 February 2017 at 10.38 p.m. by Inspector Jason Foo Xiang Chao regarding a photograph of a deceased person being circulated on social media.

10     As stated earlier, included with the SOAF, as annexes, were various exhibits. These exhibits, which were also separately marked as Prosecution exhibits, were as follows:

> (a)      Annex A (also marked as P2): The photograph of part of the SCDF Call Sheet. On this document, amongst other things, could be seen words like “The MAKENA”, “Incident Latitude”, “Incident longitude”, “Incident status”, “Incident mode”, “Incident type: Suicide Attempted”, “Source of the call”, and “Incident text: \`MAID HUNG HERSELF ON THE FAN. WE WERE OVERSEA FOR 5 DAYS’".

> (b)      Annex B (also marked as P5): Screen-shots from the accused’s phone showing the three photographs sent by Nurizzah. The time-stamp for the 1st photograph was indicated as 19:02 and the time-stamp for the last 2 photographs was indicated as 20:19 (followed by the words “So we were just visiting”).

> (c)      Annex C (also marked as P3): The photograph of the maid who was hanging from a ceiling fan with a rope around her neck. A step-ladder could be seen behind her.

> (d)      Annex D (also marked as P4): The photograph of a “Visitor’s Vehicle Pass” for “The Makena”. Details of the vehicle number, date, block, unit no. time, purpose, and a signature of the security officer could be seen.

> (e)      Annex E (also marked as P6): Screen-shots from the phone of PW2 Muhammad Ariff Bin Kamis (Ariff). He was a member of the WhatsApp chat group "hijau, kuning dan merah" who received P2 and P3 sent by the accused.

> (f)      Annex F (also marked as P1): A statement of the accused that was recorded on 4 February 2017 at 12.56 am. Amongst other things, in the statement, the accused had discussed his relationship with Nurizzah, her work as a paramedic with Unistrong and its relationship with the SCDF, and the circumstances by which he had received the photographs from Nurizzah and then forwarded them to members of the chat group by using WhatsApp. The accused also admitted that he had deleted the photographs from his phone when the police went to Nurizzah’s house.

> (g)      Annex G (also marked as P7): A cautioned statement of the accused that was recorded on 21 December 2017 at 11.57 am for the 2nd charge (involving the photograph of the maid who was hanging from the ceiling fan with a rope around her neck).

> (h)      Annex H (also marked as P8): This is the Police Report (G/20170203/2192) that was lodged on 3 February 2017 at 2238 hrs. by Inspector Jason Foo Xiang Chao regarding a photograph of a deceased person being circulated on social media.

11     Both the Prosecution and the Defence agreed that the actus reus of the alleged offences, and the events leading up to the alleged offences, were not disputed. Thus, in light of the agreed facts, the following elements of the charges were undisputed:

> (a)     The accused had received the said photographs from Nurizzah on the night of the alleged offences, and he had then forwarded two of the photographs within 2 hours of receiving them;

> (b)     Nurizzah’s act of sending the photographs to the accused contravened the OSA, for which she was convicted on 7 August 2018 of 2 charges; and

> (c)     The accused had communicated the two photographs to persons in the WhatsApp chat group named "hijau, kuning dan merah", on the date and time set out in the charges. He had done so without authorization.

12     Thus, parties essentially agreed that the only issue to be decided in this case was whether the mens rea element for the charges had been established[^1]; in particular, whether it has been shown that the accused knew or had reason to believe that the photographs were obtained and communicated to him in contravention of the OSA.

## (3)   Evidence from Prosecution witnesses

13     To supplement the evidence already agreed to by both parties, the Prosecution also called a total of 6 witnesses to testify. I summarised below the main aspects of their evidence, in so far as the evidence was relevant to the fact in issue.

### (a)   Evidence of PW1 Inspector Ho Hsien Yeow (“Insp. Ho”)

14     Insp. Ho was the recorder of the accused’s long statement (P1). This was recorded under section 23 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC), in English, on 4th of February 2017. Both Insp. Ho and the accused had appended their signatures on each page of the statement as well as at the end of the statement. In addition, the accused had also appended his signature next to amendments and handwritten words that were added in the statement. Insp. Ho confirmed that no threat, inducement, or promise was made, either before or during the statement recording, and that the statement accurately recorded what the accused had said. Insp. Ho also testified that he was not aware of any difficulty or complaint that the accused had made to him, and further stated that the accused was alert during the statement recording process. In addition, the accused did not raise to him that he was sleepy or confused at the time of the recording allegedly because of the lateness of the hour.

15     Insp. Ho said that the reason why they had invited the accused down to Bedok Division on that day was because they wanted to secure the evidence and to ensure that he did not delete the photographs sent to him. For this purpose, the accused was asked to bring his phone which contained the two pictures sent to him by his girlfriend. Insp. Ho said that while they could have recorded his statement the following morning, since the accused was already there at that time, the statement was recorded then, for his convenience, as he would then not have to make another trip to Bedok Division. Insp. Ho said that he had checked briefly with the accused about whether the latter still had the 2 photographs in his phone, and the accused mentioned that he had already deleted them. In addition, Insp. Ho had gone through the contents of the accused’s phone himself.

16     During the cross-examination of Insp. Ho, counsel challenged him by stating that that “his (counsel’s) instructions” were that during the recording of P1, the accused did not actually say that Unistrong is an outsourced company hired by the Singapore Civil Defence Force. Instead, the accused had allegedly only said that “she (Nurizzah) was working as a paramedic with Unistrong for 5 years”, and that it was he (i.e. Insp. Ho) who had included the words “which is an outsource company hired by Singapore Civil Defence Force” that appears in the accused’s statement (P1).[^2] Insp. Ho said that he could not remember this[^3].

### (b)   Evidence of PW2 Muhammad Ariff Bin Kamis (“Ariff”)

17     Ariff is a rope access technician specialist, who knew the accused as the younger brother of his childhood friend. Ariff was also a member of the “"hijau, kuning dan merah"” chat group, and he had received the two photographs found in pages 3 and 4 of P6 (screenshot of his phone) sent by the accused to the chat group. Ariff had subsequently forwarded them to three of his friends who were Indonesian domestic helpers, to advise them against committing suicide even if they should experience stress working in Singapore[^4]. Ariff was of the view that there was nothing about the photographs that indicated that they were official documents, nor was there any comments made by anyone in the WhatsApp group about them.

### (c)   Evidence of PW3 Nurizzah Afiqah Binte Hussain (“Nurizzah”)

18     Nurizzah was working as a paramedic from 2012 to 2017. She has also been the accused’s girlfriend since 2015. Nurizzah said that she would not normally talk to the accused or share with him about what happened at work him as she did not see the need to do so.

19     On 1st of February 2017, she was working for Unistrong, which is a private company. Her job scope as a paramedic was to be in charge of the ambulance crew to respond to emergency cases when people called 995. On that date, she was working with a driver, Haziq, a medic called Nicholas, and a paramedic trainee called Huda, when she was dispatched for a case of hanging. Along the way to the destination, she had taken a photograph of a call sheet (P2), for the station 21 group chat, and had forwarded this to the accused without thinking[^5].

20     When she and her colleagues arrived at the location, they had entered the house and found that the house-owner’s maid had hung herself in one of the bedrooms. Nurizzah’s driver took a photograph of the deceased to show to the paramedic trainee as the latter was afraid to look at the deceased body, and also because their station 21 chat group was asking for the deceased’s photograph. The driver then sent this photograph to the chat group of which Nurizzah was a member. Nurizzah, in turn, forwarded the photograph taken by the driver to the accused before they left the location. She also sent him another photograph, P4, which was of a Visitor’s Vehicle Pass, and messaged the accused stating that “We were just visiting the place” i.e. the condominium where the deceased was found. Nurizzah said that she felt that “it was just a bit odd…for the security to be giving us a vehicle pass, to enter the condominium when…we enter any condominium during our call.”[^6]

21     In all, Nurizzah confirmed that P2 was taken by her before she reached the location, P3 was taken by Haziq and forwarded by him, while P4 was taken when they arrived at the location[^7]. She also confirmed that P2 was sent at 1902 hours to the accused, while P3 and P4 were sent at 2019 hours to him. She did not speak to the accused before or after sending the photographs. At 2133 hours, the accused sent her a message “WTF!!!!”, followed by an audio message at 2142 hours which lasted for 4 seconds.[^8]

22     Nurizzah said that she forwarded P3 and P4 to the accused because she was emotionally disturbed at that time, as this was only her second time attending to a hanging case. It was also the first time that she had seen the deceased still hanging from the rope when she arrived. Nurizzah further said that she believed that this was the first time that she had sent work related photographs to the accused. Later that night, after work, the accused had called her and they spoke for a while before going to bed. However, she did not know that the accused had shared the photographs of the call sheet and the maid with his friends via WhatsApp. Neither did she expect him to send them to other people. She only found out about this on the day that she was bailed out by her sister. Nurizzah also said that these were not normal photographs that she would send to people, and she did not think the accused ought to have done anything with them. She said that she has not spoken to him about this as they were both very sad over what had happened.

23     Nurizzah confirmed that on 7th August 2018, she had pleaded guilty to 2 counts under section 5(1) of the OSA, with one other count taken to consideration. The charges that she pleaded guilty to were in respect of the photographs that she had forwarded to the accused.

24     In response to counsel, Nurizzah claimed that she did not tell the accused that she worked for Unistrong, only that she was working as a paramedic. Neither did she tell him that she had signed documents which made her liable under the OSA. She had also not told him not to forward any photograph or document which she sent to him to anyone else, nor had she informed him that the photographs P2, P3 and P4 were confidential or secret and that they were for his eyes only. She agreed that when she forwarded the photographs P3 and P4 to the accused, and added the words “ “So we were just visiting”, the latter was a sarcastic remark to express disbelief at what the security guard had written as the purpose of the visit.[^9] In addition, Nurizzah said that when she forwarded the photographs to the accused, she herself did not know that she was breaching the OSA, and that she only found out about this on 3 February 2017 when she was arrested by the police officers.

### (d)   Evidence of PW4 Inspector Yeo Qi Qi Eunice (“Insp. Yeo”)

25     Insp. Yeo was the investigation officer for this case, and also the recorder of the s 23 CPC statement (the “cautioned statement”- P7) from the accused. This was recorded on 21 December 2017 from 1157 hours to 1203 hours. When asked what she understood the accused to have meant when he said in the cautioned statement that “…there was no malicious intention when sharing the pictures”, Insp. Yeo said that the accused meant no harm to anyone.

### (e)   Evidence of PW5 Lai Yew Loon (“Mr Lai”)

26     Mr Lai is a Senior Operations Manager of Unistrong Technology Private Limited. He testified that Unistrong provides ambulance services to SCDF and SAF. Since 2009, Unistrong has had a tender with SCDF to provide emergency ambulance services. While the company also provides private ambulance services, this is minimal as the “core” of their work is with the SCDF and the SAF. He said that as Unistrong is contracted by the SCDF, they have to follow the SCDF SOPs, and their staff shouldn’t take any photographs of SCDF patients, although this was not explicitly stated in their employees’ contracts.

27     Mr Lai was also the person that Nurizzah reported to when she was working for Unistrong. She had worked for them from 2012 to 2017. Mr Lai revealed that she did not have any form pertaining to the OSA in her personal file[^10]. He said that when Nurizzah was working with Unistrong, she dealt exclusively with SCDF ambulance calls. Mr Lai also confirmed that the ambulances do not have any insignia stating that they are from the SCDF, although the colours of their ambulance staff’s uniforms are the same as that of the SCDF, but without ranks or other SCDF identification. Their name tag shows “Unistrong” and their ambulance has a call sign stating PA (private ambulance), and are marked as “Emergency Ambulances Service”.

### (f)   Evidence of PW6 Chua Kok Sin (“Captain Chua”)

28     PW5 Chua Kok Sin is a Captain (“Captain Chua”) and a senior discipline officer (SDO) in the SCDF. In his role as a SDO, he is in charge of the discipline of the SCDF servicemen, including full-time and NSmen.

29     Captain Chua testified that the accused served in the SCDF from February 2010 until his operational ready date (ORD) on 1st December 2011. The accused was trained as a fire and rescue specialist. He held the rank of sergeant and was a section commander in the special rescue platoon during his full time national service.

30     Captain Chua said that based on the accused’s training and background in the SCDF, he would have been able to know that P2 was part of a Call Sheet, and that it related to the incident in P3. Captain Chua also testified that he is not sure whether the format for the call sheet has changed after 2011, and that just by looking at P2, one could not tell the date, month or year that it was generated. However, the location of the incident, the incident status, incident type and description of the incident could be seen on the document![]([2019] SGDC 0190_Image/[2019] SGDC 0190_image3.jpeg)

31     Captain Chua also said that at the time that the accused served his national service in the SCDF, there was already a SCDF directive (P9), that has been in force since January 2009. This laid down the policy that all official information was classified and they were not supposed to disclose it to any unauthorised personnel either verbally or through the social media. The servicemen were also not supposed to take photographs or videos of SCDF premises or training or operational to upload. This directive was also briefed to all SCDF servicemen and was in force when the accused was serving his national service.

## (4)   Calling of Defence

32     Following submissions from the Prosecution and Defence, I was satisfied that there was some evidence which was not inherently incredible and which satisfied each and every element of the charges. I thus called on the accused to give his defence, and he elected to take the stand.

## (5)   The Defence’s case

33     The accused was the only witness for the Defence. He testified that Nurizzah is his girlfriend whom he started dating since late 2015. At the time of the alleged offences on 1st February 2017, he was aware that she was an ambulance paramedic. In that role, she had to attend to emergency calls and to save lives. He was also aware that she worked for Unistrong.

34     On the date of the offence, the accused had gone for soccer training at about 7:00pm, and this ended at about 9:00pm. He then checked his phone and saw that Nurizzah had sent him 3 photographs; one picture consisted of someone hanging herself and the other two were of documents. When he saw the pictures, the accused said that he “was shocked and a bit disturbed” by the picture of the person hanging herself. He replied to Nurizzah “WTF” followed by 4 exclamation marks. He then informed her that he was going to wash up, head back home and that he would see her later that night itself. Shortly after this, he had put his phone aside, taken a shower, changed clothes, and headed home. When he was in the car, he forwarded two of the pictures (P2 and P3) to a group chat consisting of his friends. This was the chat group “hijau, kuning dan merah”. The accused said that his intention was “…to share with my friends something interesting “[^11]. He said at the time that he sent the photographs, he was in a rush as he needed to send his dad home and then to meet with Nurizzah.

35     Later that night, he had met Nurizzah and she told him how her day was. She also told him about the incident and that she had sent the pictures to him during her course of work. She confided in him how about how horrifying and terrifying the whole experience was.

36     The accused testified that on 3 February 2017, he was at Nurizzah’s house at about 8 pm when police officers came and asked her about some photographs. Nurizzah subsequently informed him that she needed to go to the station to assist the police with investigations. When this happened, the accused said that he had a feeling that the photographs had something to do with it and that they were not supposed to be in his possession. He then decided to get rid of them by deleting them from his phone.

37     Subsequently, about an hour later, he got a call from the police, saying that they needed to check Nurizzah’s motorbike and that they needed him to come down to assist them. When he did this, he “was ambushed by the police”, who made him empty his pockets and took and checked his mobile phone. They also brought him back to his house, took his laptop, and then brought him back to the police station.

38     The accused said that he was brought back to the station at about 11 pm, and a statement (P1) was recorded from him at 12.56 am. He said that he was scared, tired, cold and confused at that time. In court, the accused claimed that the part of his statement where he had stated that “Nurizzah was working as a paramedic at Unistrong, which is an outsourced company hired by SCDF for 5 years”, was given by him after he had been interviewed by the police. The accused said that this information was suggested to him by an officer who had told him that what he did was wrong, because Unistrong is an outsourced company hired by the Singapore Civil Defence Force. [^12] The accused also claimed that as regards the photographs that he had shared, he only knew that they related to Nurizzah’s work after he had sent them, but not before that.

39     As for why he had stated in his cautioned statement (P7) that he understood his actions and apologised for them, the accused explained that it was only after going through the entire investigation process, had he found out that what he did was actually wrong because the police had told him that he was not allowed to do this.

40     When asked about his national service experience, the accused said that his role as a section commander in the special rescue platoon (SRP) was to lead a group of 3 other men. His ORD date was on 2nd December 2011 and has not gone for any reservist duties since. Neither has he been in touch with the SCDF. The accused also claimed that he has not seen P9 before.

41     In addition, the accused claimed that Nurizzah has never told him that she was bound by the OSA, or that she worked for the SCDF. Neither has she ever told him that she shouldn’t have sent him the photographs P2 or P3, or asked him to delete them from his phone. When asked about his statement P1 where he had said that he thought that the two pictures that she sent to him were related to her work, he said that “….it may have been a possibility that it be related to her work…”. He further explained that he had written “WTF” to express his shock because the picture of the person hanging was quite gruesome. The accused also said that he didn’t think much or pay attention to the other two pictures because he was rushing at that time.

42     Further, the accused said that he knew that he would be in trouble when his statement (P1) was recorded. However, the accused also testified that he thought that everything was fine when he left the station as the police had let him off with a verbal warning. When questioned, the accused agreed that this claim - he had been given a warning - was not put to the recording officer when the latter testified.[^13]

## (6)   The law and the sole material issue in dispute

43     As stated earlier, both the Prosecution and Defence agreed that the actus reus of the alleged offences, was not disputed. The only issue in dispute was whether the accused had the requisite mens rea when he forwarded the two photographs to the WhatsApp group.

44     In submitting on their respective positions on this issue, parties referred to the two _Bridges Christopher_ decisions: the decision of the High Court in _Bridges Christopher v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] SGHC 17</span> **(**(_Bridges Christopher (High Court))_, and the subsequent Court of Appeal decision in _PP v Bridges Christopher_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 3 SLR(R) 467</span> (“_Bridges Christopher (CA))”._

45     In essence, the case of _Bridges Christopher_ involved a lawyer, who was charged with receiving information on the current addresses of certain persons from a Criminal Investigation Department (“CID”) officer, contrary to s 5(2) of the OSA. The accused then communicated this information to another lawyer who needed the information to serve processes on these persons. For the latter action, the accused was charged under s 5(1)(c)(i) of the Act. The Prosecution there argued that as the addresses came from the CID’s on-line system, they constituted secret official information.

46     On appeal to the High Court, Yong Pung How CJ found that the Prosecution had not called any evidence to show that the addresses in question were not available from the registration officer responsible for maintaining the electoral registers. There was thus a real possibility that the information in that case was information that was made available to the public from an authorised source, namely, the registration officer. Yong CJ thus held that the Prosecution had failed to establish a prima facie case that the information, which formed the subject matter of the charges, was official information protected by the Act (see \[42\]) of _Bridges Christopher (High Court))._ The accused was acquitted on appeal.

47     Following the decision of the High Court, a criminal reference was brought by the Public Prosecutor to the Court of Appeal. The decision of the Court of Appeal was reported as _Bridges Christopher (CA)._ Amongst other things, at \[46\], the Court of Appeal made it clear that to establish the mens rea elements for a s 5(1)(c)(i) OSA offence, it has to be shown that there was:

> (a)     An intention to communicate the information;

> (b)     Knowledge that the information was obtained by the communicator in contravention of the Act; and

> (c)     Knowledge of the communicator that he had no authority to communicate the information to the person to whom he communicated it or that he had no duty to communicate it to the person he communicated it.

48     Further as regards the knowledge of the communicator on the source of the information, the Court elaborated at \[47\] that there must be “…evidence on which it could reasonably be inferred that \[the accused\] knew or had ground to believe that he…was in possession of “protected” information which was obtained…and communicated to him in contravention of the Act”.

49     In the present case, both the Prosecution and the Defence agreed that the mens elements set out in \[47(a)\] and \[47(c)\] above were not disputed[^14]. The only issue in contention was whether the mens rea element in \[47(b)\] had been made out, i.e. whether the Prosecution has shown that the accused knew or that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the accused was in possession of “protected” information obtained by Nurizzah and communicated to him in contravention of the OSA.

## (7)   The mens rea element has been established beyond a reasonable doubt

50     Having gone through the evidence and submissions of parties, I was of the view that it has been established beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused knew or, at least, that he had reasonable grounds to believe that he was in possession of “protected” information obtained by Nurizzah and communicated to him in contravention of the OSA. My reasons are set out below.

### (a)   Nature of photographs and circumstances in which the accused saw them

51     Based on the timing, sequence and other circumstances in which the accused received and saw the photographs from Nurizzah, and the nature and contents of the photographs, the accused would have known, or he would, at least, have had reasonable grounds to believe that they were confidential and obtained by Nurizzah in the course of her work.

52     In this regard, I noted that the three photographs were sent by Nurizzah to the accused on the same night, within a relatively short period of time of each other (i.e. at 7.02 pm for P2, and at 8.19 pm for both P3 and P4). However, what was especially pertinent was the fact that they were all opened and seen by the accused on his phone at the same time i.e. at about 9.10 pm on 1 February 2017:

> (a)     The first photograph (P2), which was a photograph of part of a SCDF Call Sheet, was sent to the accused at 7.02 pm. From the face of the document that the accused saw, it was obvious that P2 was an official document containing details such as information about an incident concerning the discovery of the suicide of a maid, with the condominium name and precise incident location (latitude and longitude), incident type, incident status and incident description, all visible. Amongst other things, on P2 could be seen the following words:

>> (i)       “The MAKENA”

>> (ii)       “Incident Latitude: XXXXXX[^15]”

>> (iii)       “Incident longitude: XXXXXXX”

>> (iv)       “Incident status: OPEN”

>> (v)       “Incident mode: L”

>> (vi)       “Incident type: Suicide Attempted”

>> (vii)       “Source of the call: 0”

>> (viii)       “Incident text: "MAID HUNG HERSELF ON THE FAN. WE WERE OVERSEA FOR 5 DAYS"”.

> (b)     The second photograph (P3) that the accused saw at the same time as P2, was a photograph of a female person, clad in T shirt and shorts, hanging suspended from a fan with a rope around her neck. A step ladder could also be seen behind her body. This photograph appeared directly below the first photograph (P2) in the accused’s phone.

> (c)     The third photograph (P4), which he again saw at the same time as P2 and P3, was a photograph of a document with the heading “The Makena” and “Visitor’s Vehicle Pass”. Details on P4 included the following:

>> (i)       Vehicle number: XXXX

>> (ii)       Date: 1/2/17

>> (iii)       Block: XXX

>> (iv)       Unit No: XXX

>> (v)       Time: 1909

>> (vi)       Purpose: visit

> This document had also been signed by a security officer of the condominium. P4 appeared immediately below both P2 and P3 in the accused’s phone. Further, below P4, were the words “So we were just visiting” that Nurizzah had added.

53     From the contents and circumstances in which the accused had seen the three photographs P2, P3 and P4:

> (a)     It could be reasonably inferred that they all related to the same incident, having been sent by Nurizzah to the accused within a short time of each other, and appearing, one after another, in his phone. Further, the contents of the photographs all had an obvious and common nexus. In this regard, P4 (“Visitor’s Vehicle Pass”), had the words ‘The Makena’ on top, hence tying P4 with what was shown in P2 (part of the SCDF Call Sheet with the ‘The Makena’ indicated), which in turn, because of the subject matter (“suicide of maid hanging herself from a fan”), was linked to P3 (showing a female clad in shorts hanging suspended from a fan with a rope around her neck).

> (b)     P4 also had the precise unit number in the Makena where the paramedics (including Nurizzah) were ‘visiting’, as well as the exact time (1909 hours) and the date (1/7/2017) that they were attending to the incident. Further, the words “So **_we_** were just visiting” (emphasis added) written by Nurizzah below P4 (the photograph of the \`Visitor Pass’ issued by the security guard for ‘The Makena’) further linked all three photographs to the \`visit’ that Nurizzah had made to that unit at “The Makena”, with the date and time of the \`visit’ also stated.

> (c)     Collectively, P2-P4, would have showed to the accused, who had seen all three photographs at the same time (around 9.10 pm), that there was an incident reported of a maid who had attempted suicide at a specific and identified apartment unit at \`The Makena’, a condominium with the precise co-ordinates provided. The maid was shown in P3, a separate photograph, to be still hanging from the ceiling fan by a rope around her neck. That photograph, was aptly described by the accused himself as “gruesome”.[^16]

> (d)     Further, since the photographs were sent by Nurizzah to the accused between 7.02 pm and 8.19 pm, and since the accused admitted in his statement (P1) at the third paragraph of page one, that “I know that Izzah is working form 9 am to 9 pm on that day”, the accused clearly knew that these three photographs related to and were obtained by Nurizzah in the course of her work as a paramedic. This conclusion was fortified by the fact that the accused had also admitted that he knew that Nurizzah was an ambulance medic working for Unistrong, and that in that role, she had to attend to emergency calls and to save lives. P2-P4, clearly related to Nurizzah’s work for Unistrong.

> (e)     In short, the accused knew or, at least, had grounds to believe that the photographs that he obtained from Nurizzah – which related to her attending to a case of suicide (during her work hours) - were obtained in the course of her work.

54     Separately, the date and timing indicated on P4 (as 1909 hrs on 1/2/17) would also have reinforced to the accused the idea that the information (in P2 and P3) was not publicly available or publicly known, since they showed that the incident that the paramedics were attending to, was a very recently discovered event (being barely 2 hours old). In addition, clearly private information such as the exact address and the other details on P4 (on an apparently official “Visitor’s Vehicle Pass” signed by a security guard) would have further indicated that the information was genuine and confidential.

55     Indeed, not only would the source and circumstances of the photographs - as having been obtained by Nurizzah as part of her work as a paramedic attending to an emergency incident involving a specific suicide case at an identified date and time, and at an exact location at an identified apartment unit at \`The Makena’- have alerted the accused to its confidential status, the highly unusual contents of the photographs would also have made him aware of their confidential nature.

56     In this regard, I agreed with the Prosecution that P2 and P3 were not photographs that one would normally come by during social exchanges with friends and acquaintances. Instead, the photographs that the accused received from Nurizzah, were of a recently reported incident, and they showed a person who had apparently died from hanging by a rope around her neck in a residential setting, with accompanying photographs detailing the exact incident location and status of that person (“a maid”), as well as the time and date that she was attended to. Such photographs – which were clearly of a fresh and genuine incident – would only be available to personnel who respond to such emergency incidents, such as the security personnel like the police, or medical personnel/paramedics (like Nurizzah) aligned with the SCDF.

57     I would add that the present situation was in sharp contrast to the scenario in the _Bridges Christopher_ case. The latter involved commonly accessible and available information such as the residential addresses of persons, which were incidentally also not time or date sensitive. In contrast, the information involved in the present case, which the accused obtained and then communicated without authority, was that of a _recently_ reported suicide incident, with location details and incident descriptions (in P2), and a photograph of a body still hanging from a fan with a rope around her neck (in P3). Such photographs were clearly not commonly or publicly available information.

58     Indeed, the accused himself admitted that they were not normal images that anyone would have access to.[^17] Even Nurizzah, a paramedic of many years’ standing, had stated that this was the first time that she had seen a deceased person still hanging from the rope when she arrived.

59     Finally, I also noted that the accused did not simply forward the photographs that he received from Nurizzah to members of his Whatsapp group immediately after he saw them. Instead, while he saw all three photographs at around 9.10 pm, he only forwarded two photographs to the WhatsApp chat group at about 9.50 pm. Further, as highlighted by the Prosecution, it was also pertinent that the accused only forwarded two of the three photographs, namely those photographs which indicated that there was a suicide involving a maid, and which also showed the \`sensational’ (and gruesome) sight of the maid still hanging from the ceiling fan with a rope around her neck.

60     Thus, contrary to the accused’s claims, he had not simply forwarded the photographs (that he obtained from Nurizzah) in a “rush”, nor was it the case that he did he not have time to deliberate and think about them before he did what he did. Instead, all evidence points to him having had time to consider the contents of the photographs, before he took the decision to select only two of the three photographs to send to members of his WhatsApp chat group.

61     In short, in light of the nature and contents of the photographs, and the circumstances in which the accused saw P2 and P3 (together with P4), the accused knew or, at least, had reasonable grounds to believe that he was in possession of “protected” information, obtained by Nurizzah in the course of her work as a paramedic with Unistrong, and that such information was confidential, very recent and not publicly available. He then deliberately chose the two photographs which contained the information and evidence about the suicide of a specific maid. These selected and sensational photographs were sent to members of a WhatsApp chat group, just because he wanted to “share with \[his\] friends something interesting”.[^18]

### (b)   Other admissions of the accused and his personal circumstances

#### (i)   The accused knew that the photographs related to Nurizzah’s work with Unistrong which was a company hired by the SCDF

62     In addition to the above evidence pertaining to the accused’s mens rea, in his statement (P1), the accused had also admitted that:

> (a)    His girlfriend, Nurizzah (or “Izzah”), whom he had known since secondary school and with whom he had entered into a relationship since August 2015, was “… **working as Paramedic with Unistrong which is an outsource company hired by Singapore Civil Defence Force for 5 years**.”

> (b)    On 1 February 2017, at about 9.10 am when he saw the two pictures (P2 and P3) that were sent by her earlier, he stated that “**I think that the two pictures were related to her work** and so I replied Izzah through Whatsapp saying "WTF".”

> (c)    When he subsequently forwarded the photographs to the chat group at about 9.50 pm, he stated that “(t)he reason which I forwarded the pictures was to share the picture with my friends **which Izzah has attended**.”

> (d)    Also, when asked point blank by the recording officer whether he **“…. \[knew\] that the pictures were related to Izzah's work**?”, the accused had answered **“Yes**.”

\[emphasis added\]

63     While the Defence tried to suggest that the incriminating contents in P1 did not originate from the accused, I rejected this argument for the following reasons:

> (a)     First, there was no dispute that P1 was a voluntary statement. As clearly stated in the SOAF, and from the evidence led at trial, no assertion was made by the Defence that the contents of P1 were given in connection with any threat, inducement or promise, or as a result of the accused being put under any form of duress.

> (b)     Second, while there was a claim put by the Defence to Insp. Ho that the accused was sleepy and confused at the time of statement recording, the recorder, Insp. Ho, was clear that the accused had not raised any such issue to him.[^19] This suggests that the claim of the accused was an afterthought. In fact, I noted that when the accused subsequently gave evidence, his claim had expanded from being merely “sleepy and confused” when he gave his statement in P1, to being allegedly “scared”, “tired”, “really very cold” and also “confused” when P1 was recorded from him.[^20]

> (c)     Third, in any event, the evidence suggested that rather than being sleepy and confused (or “scared”, “tired”, “really very cold” and “confused”) when P1 was being recorded from him, it was more likely that the accused was alert and careful when giving his statement in P1.

>> (i)       For one, just prior to the recording of P1, the accused was already aware that the police may be interested in the photographs that he had received from Nurizzah, and would thus be conscious of the need to exercise caution when dealing with them. This could be seen from the fact that at about 8 pm, when the police came to look for Nurizzah, the accused had taken the initiative and spontaneously deleted the incriminating photographs from his phone. This was done even before the police had expressed any interest in him, or had started to question him about them. It is thus more likely that the accused would have continued to be in a heightened and vigilant state when he gave his statement in P1, as this was recorded merely hours after his unilateral act of “self-preservation” of deleting the incriminating evidence. Certainly, there was nothing to suggest that the accused was in such a helpless and malleable state as to self-incriminate when he provided his voluntary statement in P1 only hours after he had taken action to delete the photographs.

>> (ii)       I also noted that P1 contained handwritten amendments, all of which the accused had signed against. He had also signed on each page of P1. Further, he had affirmed the statement to be true and correct on the last page of the statement.

>> (iii)       I was thus satisfied that P1 contained what he had said, and also what he had wanted to say, to the recorder.

> (d)     Fourth, I also did not accept the attempts by the accused to dissociate himself from the admissions that he had made in P1, in light of the inconsistent position that the Defence had put forward on whether the accused even said some of the incriminating words in P1. In this regard:

>> (i)       In P1, the accused had stated that Nurizzah worked “as a Paramedic with Unistrong which is an outsource company hired by Singapore Civil Defence Force”. During the cross-examination of Insp Ho, the recorder of P1, the Defence had specifically put to Insp Ho that: [^21]

>>> “Now, I am instructed by my client, that **_he never told you_** **_that he knew that \[PW3\] was hired or the Unistrong was outsourced---outsourced company of Singapore Civil Defence Force or it only was, she was working for Unistrong as a paramedic for 5 years._** **_He did not tell you that Unistrong is an outsource company of the Singapore Civil Defence Force_****_._** **_He never told you that during the recording of the statement_**. You can agree or disagree or you cannot remember?”

\[emphasis added\]

>> (ii)       However, during the cross-examination of the accused, he contradicted himself by admitting that **_he did say_** something to the effect of what was recorded in P1, but that he only did this because Insp. Ho had given him this information prior to recording his long statement.[^22]

>> (iii)       Clearly the Defence was taking an inconsistent approach. While the accused accepted that the two “versions are different”, when pressed to explain the two contradictory positions that the Defence had taken, the accused was clearly not able to do so.[^23]

>> (iv)       This episode again suggested that the Defence’s (different) attempts at trying to downplay and dissociate the accused from the incriminating aspects of his statement, were afterthoughts.

> (e)     Finally, Insp. Ho, the recorder of P1, repeatedly made it clear that the contents of the statement came from the accused[^24]. While Insp. Ho was not able to recall some aspects of the statement recording process, I saw no basis to believe that the contents of the statement did not originate from the accused. Clearly, there was no reason for Insp Ho to lie, fabricate evidence or falsely implicate the accused at all.

64     Thus, from his admissions in P1, it could also be seen that the accused knew that the photographs P2 and P3 were obtained by Nurizzah in the course of her work as a medic with Unistrong, and also that Unistrong was in fact working for the SCDF. In fact, the accused indicated in P1 that (as at 1 February 2017) he was aware that Unistrong (and hence its employees) had been doing such work for the SCDF for 5 years. In this regard, it is not surprising that the accused knew such information, since Nurizzah, whom he had known since secondary school and who had also been his girlfriend since 2015, had been working with Unistrong since 2012, and she dealt exclusively with SCDF ambulance calls when she worked with Unistrong (see evidence of Mr Lai at \[27\] above).

65     In short, in light of Nurizzah’s long-standing and close relationship not only with the accused, but also with Unistrong and the SCDF, the accused clearly knew about Nurizzah’s working links and relationship with the SCDF, at the time that he received P2 and P3 from her, which she had sent to him in the course her performing such duties. Accordingly, the accused knew or, at least, had ground to believe that the photographs were obtained by her in the course of her performing work for SCDF (through Unistrong).

#### (ii)   The accused knew about the confidential nature of information relating to SCDF operations and knew or had ground to believe that P2 and P3 were protected information obtained and communicated contrary to the Act

66     As stated above, the accused would have been aware of the confidential nature of the information that Nurizzah had sent to him, and that it was obtained in relation to work for the SCDF. This was, however, not the end of the evidence adduced. Instead, aside from the circumstances of his receipt and review of the photographs, and his awareness of their confidential and sensitive nature, what must also be considered were the circumstances of the accused himself.

67     In this regard, I noted from Captain Chua’s evidence that the accused was a fire and rescue specialist and a section commander in the special rescue platoon of the SCDF during his full time national service (NS). The accused had, in fact, served in the SCDF from February 2010 until 1st December 2011. In his NS capacity, he would have been briefed on the contents of the SCDF directive (P9), which itself has been in force since January 2009. Indeed, this was consistent with what Captain Chua had testified i.e. that all SCDF servicemen had been briefed about the contents of P9.

68     P9, amongst other things, made it clear that the provisions of the OSA applied, that all official information is confidential, and that such information is not to be disclosed to the media or to unauthorised personnel in any form. In addition, it was also explicitly made clear that the taking or uploading of photographs or videos taken of SCDF premises, or of operational incidents or exercises and training, are prohibited.

69     While the accused denied that he had even seen P9 before, this was essentially contrary to the evidence of Captain Chua. Further, I was of the view that in light of the almost 2 years (2010 to 2011) that he had spent in the SCDF, and taking into account his role was that of a section commander who led a group of men in the SCDF, the accused clearly would have known of the essential features of P9, in particular, the need for those working for the SCDF to safeguard and not communicate, without authority, information relating to SCDF’s operations, such as part of the SCDF Call Sheet, (P2) or the photograph of the deceased maid hanging from the fan with a rope around her neck (P3). Certainly from the evidence adduced, it could also reasonably be inferred that the accused had grounds to believe that as regards P2 and P3 (that he received from Nurizzah), he was in possession of “protected” information which was obtained by Nurizzah and communicated to him in contravention of the Act.

70     In any case, it was undisputed that Nurizzah was subsequently convicted on 7 August 2017 for her role in the unauthorised communication of the two photographs to the accused in contravention of the Act (see \[9\] above setting out agreed facts extracted from the SOAF).

71     I would add that Captain Chua also expressed the view that personnel with a certain level of training would recognise the information in P2 as that found in a SCDF Call Sheet. In this particular case, Captain Chua also highlighted that the accused would have been briefed on the operational procedure, activation procedure etc., even though Captain Chua agreed that he was unable to confirm that the accused had specifically handled a Call Sheet during his time in the SCDF.

72     All in all, with the accused’s prior experience and knowledge of the restrictions and prohibitions (including the application of the OSA) which applied to disclosure of information on SCDF operations, and from the nature and contents of the actual photographs involved, as well as from the other evidence discussed above (including the accused’s admissions in P1), it was clear that the accused knew or that he, at least, had reasonable grounds to believe that P2 and P3 constituted “protected” information, and that they were obtained and communicated to him in contravention of the Act.

### (c)   The cautioned statement of the accused was corroborative of his guilty mind

73     The accused’s cautioned statement (P7) for the 2nd charge, which involved the photograph of the maid who was hanging from the fan with a rope around her neck, was recorded from him on 21 December 2017. The recorder was Insp. Yeo, a different officer from the officer (Insp. Ho) who had recorded the accused’s earlier long statement P1.

74     As regards P7, it should be noted that:

> (a)     Unlike his long statement (P1), which was recorded on 3 February 2017 i.e. two days after the offences, and which the accused, _inter alia_, claimed was

>> (i)       influenced’ by what the recorder himself had said, and

>> (ii)       which the accused complained was recorded late at night when he was allegedly scared, tired, cold and confused,

> the accused’s cautioned statement P7 was recorded at a much later date after the alleged offences, and also long after investigations had begun. Specifically, P7 was recorded almost 10 months later on 21 December 2017, and done at 11.57 a.m., when presumably the accused was “no longer” scared, tired, cold and/or confused.

> (b)     Further, by the time the cautioned statement P7 was recorded i.e. by 21 December 2017, the accused would have had ample time to fully consider not only his actions in relation to the offences, but also what he had earlier told the police in P1. In addition, the accused would have known by then that despite having been purportedly informed by the police that they only intended to issue him a warning for his actions, the police appeared to have changed their minds and now intended to charge him for what he had done.

> (c)     Moreover, before his cautioned statement was recorded, the specific charge was read to him and he was explicitly told that he was being charged with having made the unauthorised communication of a photograph of the deceased person that he had obtained from Nurizzah “…in contravention of the Official Secrets Act (Cap 213, 2012 Rev Ed)”.

> (d)     The accused was then administered the following Notice of Warning:

>> “Do you want to say anything about the charge that was just read to you? **_If you keep quiet now about any fact or matter in your defence and you reveal this fact or matter in your defence only at your trial, the judge may be less likely to believe you. This may have a bad effect on your case in court._** Therefore, it may be better for you to mention such fact or matter now. If you wish to do so, what you say will be written down, read back to you for any mistakes to be corrected and then signed by you.”.

\[emphasis added\]

75     Following the above procedures, the accused stated the following in P7:

> “This incident was very unfortunate. Did not see it going this way. We have all lost our jobs and deeply regret our actions. There were (sic) no malicious intent when sharing the pictures. We understand our actions and humbly and deeply apologise”.

76     Yet despite the above precautions and procedures being adopted when recording P7, and despite the fact that the details of the allegation (as set out in the charge), and the ‘statutory reminder’ (as set out in the Notice of Warning) were given to the accused, what was noteworthy about P7, was not only what the accused had said, but also what he did not say.

> (a)     First, the accused did not deny that he had obtained the photograph “…in contravention of the Official Secrets Act”; nor did he claim not to know that it was obtained in breach of the OSA. Notably, he only made such claims of ignorance in court.

> (b)     Further, the accused also did not deny that after he had obtained the photograph from Nurizzah, he had forwarded it to the members of the WhatsApp chat group.

> (c)     In addition, the accused also did not disclaim, nor did he say anything to dissociate himself from what he had said in his earlier statement P1, including his earlier incriminating admissions contained in P1 that:

>> (i)       He knew that Nurizzah was “…working as Paramedic with Unistrong which is an outsource company hired by Singapore Civil Defence Force for 5 years.”, and

>> (ii)       He knew that the photographs that he was alleged to have unlawfully communicated to the WhatsApp chat group, were related to Nurizzah’s work.

> (d)     Instead, the accused merely stated in P7 that there was no malicious intent when the photographs were shared, even as he admitted that “we understand our actions and humbly and deeply apologise”.

77     Thus, the cautioned statement of the accused, taken together with the evidence already adduced, served only to confirm that he had the requisite mens rea for the offence.

## (8)   The finding of guilt

78     In _Teo Keng Pong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 2 SLR(R) 890</span>, Yong Pung How CJ spoke about the Prosecution’s burden of proof at the close of the trial. At \[68\], his Honour had stated:

> “**It bears repeating that the burden on the prosecution is to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. It is not to prove the case beyond all doubts**. That standard is impossible to achieve in the vast majority of cases. In almost all cases, there will remain that minutiae of doubt. ….. The question in all cases is whether such doubts are real or reasonable, or whether they are merely fanciful. It is only when the doubts belong to the former category that the prosecution had not discharged its burden, and the Accused is entitled to an acquittal.”

\[emphasis added\]

79     Based on the evidence adduced, and in light of the matters expressly agreed between parties as well as the other undisputed facts, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved the case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt and I convicted him accordingly.

## (9)   Decision on Sentence

80     Both parties agreed that a fine would be an appropriate sentence for each of the charges that the accused had been convicted of, with only the quantum of fine being in dispute. The Prosecution submitted for a fine of $1,500 per charge, while the Defence argued for a fine of $1,000 per charge.

81     As Nurizzah had been fined $1,500 per charge for unlawfully communicating the photographs to the accused, I was of the view that a similar fine of $1,500 per charge should also be imposed on the accused. In this regard, despite the fact that the accused had forwarded the photographs to a larger group consisting of more than 30 people, I took into account the fact that he has a clean record, and I accepted his statement in P7 that he had carried out his actions without malicious intent, and that he was apologetic.

82     Thus, as he was convicted of a total of two charges, the global fine imposed was $3,000 (in default 2 weeks’ imprisonment) for the two charges.

## (10)   Conclusion

83     The accused has appealed against his conviction. No appeal against sentence has been filed by either party. The accused has since paid the fine imposed.
