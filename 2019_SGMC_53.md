\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9211/2019/01.\]

5 September 2019

### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## A.   Background

#### The Charge

1       The accused, _Mr Lim Eng Chun_, a 56-year old male Singaporean, had pleaded guilty on 3 September 2019 which was the first day of a two-day trial, to one charge of obtaining credit for a sum of $100,000 without disclosing to the lender that he was an undischarged bankrupt, an offence under s 141(1)(a) and punishable under s 146 Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed) (“BA”) in **MSC 901293-2018**. He was sentenced to six weeks_’_ imprisonment with effect from 3 September 2019.

2        This is his appeal against sentence filed on 3 September 2019 itself through his Counsel, Mr Selva Kumara Naidu who had represented him when he pleaded guilty in the first instance. The proceeded charge against him is as follows:

> Exhibit C1A – **_1st charge (Amended)_**

> “… that you, having been adjudged a bankrupt on 15 October 2015, did, on or about 31 July 2016, obtain credit for a sum of S$100,000.00 from one Chong Siew Chin, without disclosing to Chong Siew Chin that you are an undischarged bankrupt and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 141(1)(a) of the Bankruptcy Act (Chapter 20), Revised Edition 2009 and punishable under Section 146 of the same Act.”

## B.   Statement of Facts

3       The Statement of Facts (_Exhibit PS1_) prepared by the Prosecution which the accused had admitted to without qualification is as follows:

> “Lim Eng Chun, holder of Singapore NRIC (“the accused”) was adjudged a bankrupt by the High Court on 15 October 2015 in Bankruptcy Order No. 537 of 2015. The accused is an undischarged bankrupt as of today.

> 2.    Under Section 141(1)(a) of the Bankruptcy Act (Chapter 20), a bankrupt shall be guilty of an offence if, being an undischarged bankrupt, either alone or jointly with any other person, he obtains credit to the extent of $500 or more from any person without informing that person that he is an undischarged bankrupt.

> 3.    On 11 November 2015 the accused was briefed of his duties and responsibilities as an undischarged bankrupt and he also acknowledged receipt of the Bankruptcy Information Sheets which, amongst his other duties and responsibilities, informed him that it is an offence to obtain credit without disclosing his status as an undischarged bankrupt.

> 4    In August 2017 the Official Assignee received a complaint from one Mdm Chong Siew Chin (“Chong”) that the accused had obtained credit from her without disclosing his bankruptcy status to Mdm Chong.

> 5     Facts relating to Charge No. MSC-901293-2018

> 5a    Investigations revealed that the accused and Mdm Chong are distant relatives i.e. Mdm Chong is the cousin of Mdm Lucy Chua (“Chua”), the wife of the accused.

> 5b    Sometime in or around July 2016, Mdm Chong agreed to extend a personal interest-free loan of S$100,000.00 to address the accused’s financial difficulties and issued a UOB Cheque No. 086236 dated 31 July 2016 for the sum of S$100,000.00 made payable to the accused. The accused then signed an IOU Note dated 31 July 2016, evidencing the loan he had obtained from Mdm Chong and undertaking to repay the loan in full by 31 January 2017.

> 5c    When the accused obtained the said credit from Mdm Chong by way of a loan for S$100,000.00 on or about 31 July 2016, he did not disclose to Mdm Chong, at that time or anytime before, that he is an undischarged bankrupt.

> 5d    The accused failed to make any repayment for the loan by 31 January 2017 and Mdm Chong received the first repayment for the sum of $10,000 only in May 2017. Thereafter the accused’s wife i.e. Mdm Chua then signed a personal guarantee in June 2017, undertaking to repay the outstanding debt owed by the accused to Mdm Chong

## C.   Antecedents

4       The accused has no prior antecedents.

## D.   Prosecution’s Address On Sentence

5       In its oral address on sentence, the Prosecution had tendered and highlighted two cases which had proceeded for trial in its table of sentencing precedents for offences under s 141(1)(a) BA namely:

> (i)      **_MSC-901332-2018 – Borhan Bin Sani_**

>> **Trial Case.** Obtained credit (by way of a personal loan) for a sum of **S$8,000.00.** Partial repayment of $200 was made to the victim. No antecedents. He was convicted on 14/05/2019 and sentenced to **3 weeks’ imprisonment** on 13/06/2019.

> (ii)      **_MSC-901935-2016 to MSC-901938-2016 – D’Cruz Noel Terence aka Noel Terence D’Cruz_**

>> **Trial Case**. Obtained credit (by way of personal loans) for a total sum of **S$20,000.00** (S$5,000 in respect of each of the 4 charges, MSC-901935-2016 to MSC-901938-2016). No repayment was made to the victim. No antecedents. Accused was acquitted of 1 charge (MSC-901939-2016). He was convicted and sentenced on 2 March 2017 to **a total of 8 weeks’ imprisonment** (4 weeks’ imprisonment on each of the 4 charges and sentences in 2 charges were ordered to run consecutively).

6       It was submitted that for all of these cases (in the sentencing table), the sentences imposed were imprisonment terms ranging from one week to 14 weeks in serial no 12, namely:

> **_Dennis Lim Yong Hua formerly known as Lim Eng Hua_** –

> **_MSC -901479 -2017_**

> **PG case.** The accused had obtained credits by way of rental of cars from 2 rental agencies for sums of S$65,046.96 and **S$84,000.00**. No repayment was made to the victim in respect of the outstanding rental charges. **2 similar antecedents for obtaining credit** and 1 similar antecedent for unauthorised travel. He was convicted on 14/08/2017 and sentenced to 12 weeks’ imprisonment on MSC-902409-2016 and to **14 weeks’ imprisonment** on MSC-901479-2017. He was also sentenced to 3 weeks’ imprisonment on each of the 5 proceeded charges for the unauthorised travels under s.131(1)(b) BA c.20. Sentences in MSC-901479-2017, MSC-902393-2016 and MSC-902398-2016 were ordered to run consecutively and the rest concurrently. Total 20 weeks’ imprisonment.

#### Factors to be considered in sentencing

7       It was further submitted that the factors to be taken into consideration would be the amount of credit obtained as well as antecedents and whether any repayment is made and the number of charges.

8       In respect of repayment, the Prosecution had referred to _PP v Ong Ker Seng_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 134</span> at \[32\] to \[34\] and \[36\] where CJ Yong Pung How held as follows:

> “32    While I agreed that the repayment of the loan is generally a relevant factor to be taken into account when sentencing for bankruptcy offences, it must be looked at in its proper context. The repayment of the loan here was unlike the act of restitution in cases where the gist of the offence was the deprivation of property.

> 33    Since there was no allegation of any deprivation of property in this case, ''restitution'' was an inappropriate term. It goes without saying that the loan to the bankrupt had to be repaid at some point or else the bankrupt would further diminish his prospects for discharge in future. It follows that repayment of the loan by the bankrupt in these cases should not be regarded to be as strong a mitigating factor as restitution in deprivation of property cases.

> 34    On the other hand, there may be bankrupts who feel great remorse after committing the offence and try to find ways and means to quickly repay the lender. In deserving cases, the sentencing judge may (after bearing in mind that less credit should be given compared with restitution in deprivation of property cases) give appropriate credit to an offender who demonstrates his remorse, good character and potential for reform in such a manner…

> 36    In offences of obtaining credit without disclosure, I agreed with the view expressed in _R v Schefelaar_ <span class="citation">\[1939\] SSLR 221</span>; <span class="citation">\[1939\] MLJ 45</span> that such offences are generally ''more appropriately punished with imprisonment than with a fine''. In that case, McElwaine CJ said that, when faced with a heavy fine, it is improbable that a bankrupt would have sufficient funds to pay it. Hence, what is likely to follow in these cases is that either someone else would have to pay the fine on the offender's behalf (for which any punitive effect would clearly be diluted), or, alternatively, the fine would have to be derived from funds which should be available for creditors in the first place. As such, I decided that a custodial sentence was appropriate here.”

9       It was the Prosecution’s case that in _Ong Ker Seng_, the High Court was of the view that it would be more appropriate to punish the offender with an imprisonment term as opposed to a fine. It was submitted that the reason why offences under s 141(1)(a) BA generally custodial terms are imposed for these offences.

#### Sufficiently strong mitigating circumstances

10     The Prosecution had also referred to _Tan Beng Chua v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 3 SLR 1274</span>. It was submitted that the High Court in that case at \[16\] did deliberate on sentencing guidelines for bankruptcy cases:

> "16…I would add that an offender does not have to go to the extent of showing that there are exceptional circumstances warranting a deviation from the imposition of a custodial sentence for bankruptcy offences. It should suffice if he can show that there are sufficiently strong mitigating circumstances which render the imposition of a custodial sentence inappropriate."

It was further submitted that it would be a sentencing consideration whether there are sufficiently strong exceptional circumstances to warrant a deviation.

11     It was the Prosecution's position that a custodial sentence would be warranted for the present case. In respect of the repayment made, it was noted that there was full repayment made. It was submitted that from the Statement of Facts, the loan was taken in July 2016 and the full repayment was made only in July 2018. The repayment was made only after the victim proceeded to take civil action against the accused's wife in respect of the personal guarantee given by the accused's wife. It was highlighted that the full repayment was made after the present charge was preferred in Court. It was the Prosecution’s case that it cannot be said that there was remorse shown in this case by the accused and as a result of the remorse a full repayment was made. The victim had to go through great lengths to recover the loan.

12     It was submitted that based on the sentencing precedents, one of the factors would be the amount of credit that was obtained. It was further submitted that the higher the loan, the higher would be the jail amount. The highest number is serial 12, i.e. the case of _Dennis Lim Yong Hua_ but the accused in that case had two similar antecedents for obtaining credit. As such the Prosecution did not think that the case would be relevant for sentencing.

13     Lastly, the Prosecution had highlighted the case of _Helmie Bin Abdul Hamid_ for a total sum of $52,000. There were no antecedents but there was no repayment made to the victim.

> **_MSC-901513-2017 to MSC-901518-2017_**

> **PG case.** Obtained credit (by way of loans) for a total sum of S$66,500. Credits in respect of proceeded 4 out of 6 charges was a total sum of $**52,000**. No repayment was made to the victim. No antecedents. He was convicted on 22/09/2017 and **sentenced to a total of 8 weeks’** imprisonment. Sentenced to 4 weeks’ imprisonment on 2 of the proceeded charges for obtaining credits for $17,000 and $16,000. Sentences in both the said proceeded charges were ordered to run consecutively and the rest of the sentences of 2 weeks to run concurrently.

14     In the present case, it was submitted that the amount of credit is $100,000. As such, the Prosecution had urged the Court to impose a jail term of at least 8 weeks in respect of the charge _MSC 901293-2018_.

## E.   Mitigation

15     In the amended written plea in mitigation, the Counsel had urged the Court to impose a fine and not a term of imprisonment.

16     The accused’s mother-in-law was and is one Chong Lian Pa (hereinafter “Lian Pa”). She lived and still lives in Batu Pahat, Malaysia.

17     It was submitted that sometime in July 2016, Lian Pa without telling anyone else, approached her niece in Singapore for financial assistance.

18     Lian Pa knew that her daughter in Singapore then had 2 children in university in the United Kingdom and that her daughter needed money for her children’s education. However, out of pride Lian Pa did not disclose to her niece that her daughter was having difficulty financing the children’s education.

19     Lian Pa had known her niece from the time her niece was born. Lian Pa and her niece used to live in the same house in Melaka. Lian Pa’s niece and Lian Pa’s daughter were first cousins.

20     According to Counsel, the niece informed Lian Pa that she would speak to the accused directly. The niece was Chong Siew Chin, the lender in this case. Lian Pa’s daughter was and is the accused’s wife.

21     Lian Pa then told the accused that the niece would contact him. According to Counsel, this was when the accused first learnt that Lian Pa had spoken to her niece about this.

22     It was submitted that pursuant to Lian Pa’s approach, the niece then contacted the accused. The accused then received, in his own name, the loan from the niece. It was the case for the Defence that this was however, in essence financial assistance arranged by Lian Pa to help her daughter and her daughter’s family. It was further submitted that it was not arranged at the initiative of the accused, or even with his knowledge.

23     It was the case for the Defence if not for Lian Pa’s approaching her niece, her niece would never have lent the accused the money. Though distantly related, the niece and the accused were not close, and were not even in contact with each other, prior to this episode.

24     It was the case for the Defence that the loan was used primarily for the education of the children of the accused and his wife. Those children were of course, Lian Pa’s grandchildren. However, according to his Counsel, again owing to pride the accused did not disclose to the niece that the accused and his wife were unable to finance the children’s education.

25     It was submitted that the loan has since been repaid in full and it was repaid by the accused’s wife with the assistance of Lian Pa. The niece had indeed looked to the accused’s wife to recover the loan, pursuant to a subsequent guarantee which the niece obtained from the accused’s wife.

26     It was the case for the Defence had the loan been received directly by Lian Pa’s daughter (that is the accused’s wife), no offence would have been committed. It was submitted that if the accused had had the presence of mind to simply ask his wife to receive the loan, instead of himself receiving it, he would not even have been in Court.

27     It was submitted that the punishment provision, section 146 BA gives the Court a discretion whether to impose a fine or an imprisonment term or both. It was further submitted that the circumstances in which the loan came to be extended do not warrant a custodial sentence for the accused.

28     It was orally submitted that the Prosecution had referred to two cases which were claim trial cases. It was the case for the Defence that the accused in the present case had pleaded guilty in the mentions court. He had pleaded guilty again as his plea was rejected in the mentions court. It was submitted that the present case should be a case where the accused had pleaded guilty all along.

29     It was further orally submitted that the Prosecution had highlighted that the case of _Dennis Lim Yong Hua_ was not relevant as the accused there had two antecedents for identical charges. It was submitted that there was no repayment at all for $84,000 and also $65,000 and if the amounts were added up it would be more than the $100,000 in the present case. Counsel then went on to distinguish all the cases in the Prosecution’s table of sentencing precedents on the basis that they do not resemble the factual matrix of the present case.

30     His Counsel then referred to \[16\] of the case of _Tan Beng Chua_ where it was stated as follows:

> "16…I would add that an offender does not have to go to the extent of showing that there are exceptional circumstances warranting a deviation from the imposition of a custodial sentence for bankruptcy offences. It should suffice if he can show that there are sufficiently strong mitigating circumstances which render the imposition of a custodial sentence inappropriate."

It was submitted that this was the case before the Court.

31     He further referred to \[25\] of the same case where the High Court held as follows:

> “25 In my view, a short custodial term ranging from two to four weeks per charge may be considered as the starting point in sentencing, although a fine may be sufficient where the offence is a one-off instance and the offender has generally been co-operative in his bankruptcy administration.”

It was submitted that the present case is a one-off situation and in _Tan Beng Chua_ the Court was dealing with a false declaration case.

32     It was further submitted that the essence of this case was that it was not the accused who had gone out and sought out the niece. It was the case for the Defence that it was a well-intentioned person in the background who precipitated this. It was submitted that it was wrong of the accused not to disclose his bankruptcy and for that it was submitted that an appropriate fine would suffice.

## F.   Prosecution’s Reply

33     In response to the plea in mitigation, it was orally submitted that the paragraph 25 of _Tan Beng Chua_ referred to by Counsel was for a s 137(a) BA case which is false statement made to the OA. At \[7\] and \[8\] of the case, there is a table there which shows 14 charges and that Prosecution proceeded on four out of the 14 charges. It was submitted that there is where the High Court is of the view if there is a one-off instance, a short custodial sentence would be appropriate. It was further submitted that the High Court did not say that it is generally for all the offences.

34     It was submitted that it was the Prosecution's case that Madam Lian Pa informed the victim of the project that the accused was in and said that it would fetch high returns and asked the victim to contact the accused. They met up together with the victim's husband and the victim and after getting details informed that she was not interested in the business venture which involved a building construction project. The accused asked for a loan instead stating that his project was facing cash flow problems and that is when the victim extended a loan of $100,000 to the accused.

35     It was further submitted that where it was stated in the mitigation plea that the loan was primarily used for the education of the accused's children and his wife, there was no evidence to support this.

36     It was highlighted by the Prosecution that the victim had looked to the accused's wife to recover the loan only after she discovered subsequent to giving the loan that the accused is a bankrupt. The personal guarantee signed by the wife made reference to the loan by the accused himself.

## G.   The Sentence

37     In the present case, the accused had pleaded guilty to one charge of obtaining credit for a sum of $100,000 on **31 July 2016** without disclosing to the lender that he was an undischarged bankrupt under s141(1)(a) BA. At the material time, Section 141(1)(a) of the Bankruptcy Act (Chapter 20) provides that a bankrupt shall be guilty of an offence if, being an undischarged bankrupt, either alone or jointly with any other person, obtains credit to the extent of $500 or more from any person without informing that person that he is an undischarged bankrupt. The credit limit has since been increased to not less than $1,000 by Act 21 of 2015 of the Bankruptcy (Amendment Act) which took effect on **1 August 2016**.

38     The prescribed punishment for an offence of a bankrupt obtaining credit, engaging in business or standing as guarantor under s 141(1) BA and punishable under s 146 BA is a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both.

39     In the present case, the Prosecution had sought a custodial sentence of at least 8 weeks’ imprisonment. In contrast, Counsel for the accused had urged the Court to impose an appropriate fine without indicating any figure in respect of the fine.

40     The starting point for an offence under s 141(1)(a) BA is a custodial sentence. This is in line with the principles laid down by the High Court in _PP v Ong Ker Seng_ \[2001\] SLR(R) 134 which was relied upon by the Prosecution in their address on sentence, that such offences are more appropriately punished with imprisonment as a fine would have little punitive effect, if paid by third parties and if from the offender himself, it would be from funds which should be available to his creditors.

41     This is also evident from the table of sentencing precedents tendered by the Prosecution. As the cases were unreported cases and there were no written grounds of decisions given in these cases, I was mindful of the lack of precedential value for unreported cases although it provided some reference as to the range of sentences imposed for offences under s 141(1)(a) BA.

42     I agreed with the Prosecution with referrence to _Tan Beng Chua v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 3 SLR 1274</span> that only if there are sufficiently strong mitigating circumstances, the imposition of a custodial sentence would be rendered inappropriate.

43     In the present case, the accused was adjudged a bankrupt by the High Court on 15 October 2015. On 11 November 2015, he was briefed of his duties and responsibilities as an undischarged bankrupt and he had also acknowledged receipt of the Bankruptcy Information Sheets which, amongst his other duties and responsibilities, informed him that it is an offence to obtain credit without disclosing his status as an undischarged bankrupt. Yet despite being fully aware of his duties and responsibilities, in particular the duty to disclose his status as a bankrupt before obtaining credit in excess of $500, he obtained a loan of $100,000 from the victim and failed to inform her of his status. This amount of credit obtained was clearly a large amount and substantially in excess of the $500 stautory limit.

44     Counsel has sought to argue that the essence of this case was that it was not the accused who had gone out and sought out the niece. It was the case for the Defence that it was a well-intentioned person in the background who precipitated this. The loan was used primarily for the education of the children of the accused and his wife. Owing to pride, the accused did not disclose to the niece that the accused and his wife were unable to finance the children’s education. In my view, these were not sufficiently strong mitigating circumstances to warrant a departure from the usual custodial sentence for such an offence. The fact remains that the accused while being a bankrupt had obtained a loan without making the relevant disclosure to the victim. The fact that he and his wife were unable to finance their children’s overseas university education and had resorted to obtaining a loan cannot be considered as a mitigating factor.

45     As highlighted by the Prosecution, the loan was taken in July 2016 and the full repayment was only made in July 2018. This was after the victim proceeded to take civil action against the accused's wife in respect of the personal guarantee given by the accused's wife. In addition, it was undisputed that the full repayment was made only after the present charge was preferred in Court. I agreed with the Prosecution that it cannot be said that there was remorse shown in this case by the accused and as a result of the remorse a full repayment was made. I also agreed with the Prosecution that the victim had to go through great lengths to recover the loan including to initiate a suit to recover the loan.

46     In my consideration of the appropriate sentence to be imposed, I had considered the following factors namely the amount of credit obtained, whether any repayment is made and the number of charges and whether there were any antecedents. I noted that in the present case involves a loan of $100,000 which was eventually repaid by the accused's wife, the accused faced a single charge and that he had no prior antecedents. I was mindful of what CJ Yong in _Ong Ker Seng_, had stated at \[22\]:

> “22…The object of s 141(1)(_a_) of the Act is to protect innocent people from being misled by the bankrupt’s promise to pay. The onus, therefore, should not be on lenders to remember if the person they are providing credit to is, or is not, a bankrupt. By virtue of s 141(1)(_a_) of the Act, the bankrupt has been specifically tasked with the duty to inform the proposed lender before obtaining credit…”

It is clear that the onus was therefore not on the lender, Mdm Chong Siew Chin to remember or be aware if the borrower was, or was not, a bankrupt. Instead, the accused had been specifically tasked with the duty to inform the proposed lender before obtaining credit. The norm for such offences is a custodial sentence unless there were sufficiently strong mitigating circumstances.

47     In the present case, after a careful considered of the factors as stated above, I imposed a sentence of **6 weeks’ imprisonment** for MSC-901293-2018. In my view, such a sentence was just and appropriate having regard to the factual matrix of the present case.

48     Dissatisfied with my decision, the accused had filed a Notice of Appeal against his sentence on 3 September 2019. The accused is presently on bail of $15,000 with one surety pending the hearing of his appeal.
