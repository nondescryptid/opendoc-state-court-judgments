\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9222/2019/01.\]

8 October 2019

### District Judge May Lucia Mesenas:

## Background

The accused pleaded guilty to one count of using criminal force on the victim, by using his hand to squeeze her breast a few times and fondling her left nipple with his fingers, which offence is punishable under section 354(1) of the Penal Code Cap 224.

2       On 16 September 2019, the accused was sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment. On 19 September 2019, the accused filed an appeal against sentence. He was unrepresented at the time of filing the appeal. He is currently serving sentence.

## Summary of Facts

3       The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts pertaining to the charge, without qualification. He was thus convicted on the charge accordingly. The salient points are as follows:

> (a)     The female victim, aged 37 years old, was staying at the NTUC Health Nursing Home (“nursing home”) at the material time. She was diagnosed with cerebral palsy since birth and has difficulty speaking and expressing herself. Cerebral palsy is a disorder of movement caused by damage to the immature, developing brain.

> (b)     The accused was 78 years old and a retiree. At the material time, he was visiting his wife, who was also a resident of the said nursing home.

> (c)     On 22 January 2019, at above 10.30am, the victim was seated on a wheelchair facing the television at the day space area. There were around thirty elderly residents of the nursing home undergoing therapy exercises at the said area. While the accused was there with his wife, he noticed the victim sitting alone, looking ‘unwell’ and had both her hands bandaged.

> (d)     On the same day at about 10.40am, the accused approached the victim as he noticed a cockroach flying around her chest and flicked the cockroach away. At the same time, the accused saw that the victim’s clothing was loose and her breasts were partially exposed. He also noticed that she was not wearing a brassiere.

> (e)     The accused then inserted his right hand through the opening at the top of her clothing. He squeezed her left breast a few times and also fondled her left nipple with his fingers, which lasted for about five to ten seconds, knowing it to be likely that he would be outraging the victim’s modesty.

> (f)     A therapy assistant, who was conducting therapy for the other residents noticed the accused standing very close to the victim and alerted the witness, a nursing aid of the nursing home, who in turn, approached the victim. The witness also saw the accused’s right hand moving underneath the victim’s clothes, near the victim’s breast. The witness asked the accused what he was doing, to which the accused walked away and left the nursing home.

> (g)     The incident was reported to a senior staff nurse, following which the management of the nursing home was eventually informed of the same. A police report was subsequently made on 23 January 2019.

## Antecedents

4       The accused did not have related antecedents. For completeness, he was previously convicted for public gaming offences as well as acting as a bookmaker, for which he was sentenced to fines. His last conviction for public gaming was in 2000 where he was sentenced to a fine of $3,000. In 1963, he was detained for 12 months under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act Cap 67. In 1967, he was placed on police supervision for two years.

## Prosecution’s Submissions

5       The prosecution referred to the recent High Court decision of _Kunasekaran s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v PP_ \[2018\] 580 (“_Kunasekaran_”), where Chan Seng Onn J followed the “two-step sentencing bands” approach as set out in the Court of Appeal in _Ng Kean Meng Terence v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 449</span> (“_Terence Ng_”) in the context of rape cases. This was similarly followed in _GBR v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 296</span> by See Kee Oon J, in the context of offences of aggravated outrage of modesty under section 354(2) PC. Chan J was of the view that such a sentencing framework should equally be applicable for an offence under section 354(1) PC (see \[48\]).

6       Under such a sentencing framework, the court should identify under which band the offence in question falls within, having regard to the _offence-specific factors_ (i.e. the degree of sexual exploitation, circumstances of the offence and harm caused to the victim) and _offender-specific factors_ (which include the offender’s particular personal circumstances).

7       Chan J thus laid down the following sentencing bands that take into account the full spectrum of sentences that may be imposed for offences under section 354(1) PC as set out below. I have re-produced the table from prosecution’s written submissions for ease of reference:

8       The following aggravating offence-specific factors were highlighted:

> a)     The moderate to high degree of sexual exploitation by the accused on the defenceless victim where the accused had inserted his right hand through the opening at the top of her blouse and squeezed her left breast a few times and fondled her nipple with his fingers;

> b)     There was prolonged skin-to-skin contact, which lasted for about five to ten seconds;

> c)     The accused had exploited the victim’s extreme vulnerability as the victim had difficulty speaking and expressing herself due to cerebral palsy, and where the victim was unable to fend for herself, both at a physical and cognitive level;

> d)     The offence was committed in a nursing home where residents of nursing homes have a legitimate expectation of safety and protection; likewise, family members of the residents should have the assurance that their loved ones are taken care of and not violated.

9       Whilst it was undisputed that the accused is a first offender for such an offence and had co-operated with the authorities during investigations, the prosecution submitted that given the eye-witness’ account from an employee of the nursing home who saw the incident, it would not have faced substantial difficulties in proving the case against the accused.

10     In light of the foregoing, the prosecution was of the view that the sentencing principles of deterrence and retribution ought to figure prominently in the current case. The accused’s ‘egregious violation of the sanctity of the nursing home has caused public disquiet and ought to be unequivocally denounced’ in the form of a stiff sentence (see \[2\] of Prosecution’s Skeletal Sentencing Submissions). Given the aggravating factors as highlighted above, the current case falls under “Band 2” (as per the table above), for which the court was urged to consider imposing a sentence of eight months’ imprisonment.

## Mitigation

11     Defence counsel highlighted the fact that the accused had initially approached the victim to brush the cockroach away from her. In mitigation, he urged this court to take into account the accused’s early plea of guilt, his general remorse and that he had also co-operated with the authorities. Counsel further urged the court to not place any weight on the accused’s previous antecedents, as they are not similar to the present charge. He agreed with prosecution’s submissions on the offence- and offender-specific factors and that the sentence of eight months’ imprisonment term would be appropriate in the circumstances. He further submitted that no additional imprisonment term ought to be imposed in lieu of caning.

## Decision of the court

12     The punishment prescribed for the current offence of outraging the modesty of the victim under section 354(1) Penal Code Cap 224 is either imprisonment of up to two years or with fine or with caning or with any combination of such punishments.

13     The recent High Court decision of _Kunasekaran_ would be applicable. In view of the aggravating offence-specific factors as highlighted by the prosecution in \[8\] above, I agree with parties that the facts of the current case would fall under ‘Band 2’ of the sentencing framework as laid down in _Kunasekaran_, which is a sentencing range of between five to 15 months’ imprisonment.

14     The defence had alluded to a table of sentencing precedents which he had tendered. However, he did not specifically refer to it as he had agreed with the prosecution’s submission on sentence. Nonetheless, I found some of the cases highlighted therein somewhat useful. I would only refer to the relevant cases where the victim’s private parts were involved.

15     I note in the case of _PP v Hong Hequn_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 56</span> (“_Hong Hequn_”), that the accused, had, while stealing money from the victim’s flat, noticed her sleeping and squeezed her nipple through her shirt. He pleaded guilty to the charge and had no previous similar antecedents. He was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment and the appeal was subsequently withdrawn.

16     As for the case of _PP v Winston Lee Siew Boon_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGDC 308</span> (“_Winston Lee_”), the accused, who was a doctor and the victim, his patient at the material time, had claimed trial to two charges of outraging the modesty of the victim. He was found guilty of both charges of inserting his hand into his patient’s brassiere cup and touching her breast and nipple. He was sentenced to 10 months’ and nine months’ imprisonment respectively with both sentences ordered to run concurrently.

17     In the case of _Kunasekaran_, the 63-year old accused had claimed trial to one count of touching the groin area of the 14-year old victim from outside her school skirt with his fingers. Upon his conviction, the accused was sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment, as the court had taken into account, amongst other factors, that the offence took place on public transport (namely, the bus) and that the young victim suffered significant emotional and psychological trauma, consequent to the offence.

18     In the current case, there was skin-to-skin contact and the accused had squeezed the victim’s left breast a few times and fondled her nipple with his fingers, which took place over a relatively prolonged period of five to ten seconds. This would necessitate an imprisonment term of more than six months as compared to the case of _Hong Hequan_ where the accused in that case squeezed the victim’s nipple over her shirt, albeit, while she was sleeping.

19     Furthermore, as highlighted by the prosecution, the victim was a resident in the nursing home and suffering from cerebral palsy where there would have been no way for her to make any complaint against the accused for the egregious acts that were committed against her. It was only fortuitous that his acts were witnessed by one of the staff at the nursing home. His brazen acts would thus have to be visited with a stiff sentence, where the objectives of deterrence and retribution would have to come to the fore. This was also in light of See J’s observations in _GBR v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 296</span> at \[40\] of the ‘exploitation of a particularly vulnerable class of victims’, where an additional term of imprisonment term may be considered in lieu of caning. Given the above, I was initially minded to consider a sentence of at least nine months’ imprisonment and an additional imprisonment term of at least one month, in lieu of caning[^1] given that the accused is above 50 years old.

20     However, as noted in _Winston Lee_ cited above, the accused in that case was a doctor and had clearly violated the sacrosanct trust between doctor and patient, was sentenced to a global imprisonment term of 10 months’. He had also claimed trial to both charges of outraging the modesty of the victim on two occasions.

21     The current case is similar to _Winston Lee’s_ case in so far as the act of intrusion is concerned. In both cases, the accused persons had direct skin contact with their respective victims, where the breast and nipple was touched. The acts of the current accused could be said to be more aggravated in that he had squeezed the victim’s left breast a few times and fondled her nipple with his fingers for between five to ten seconds.

22     However, the current case can be distinguished from _Winston Lee_ in that the accused had pleaded guilty at the first instance to one count of outrage of modesty as opposed to claiming trial to two charges of the same. I was also mindful that the current accused was a first offender for such offences, and had also co-operated with the authorities, which would have necessitated a sentencing discount from the initial indicative sentence of nine months’ imprisonment as well as an additional imprisonment in lieu of caning. Having taken into account both the aggravating and mitigating factors highlighted, I was thus of the view that a sentence of eight months’ imprisonment would be appropriate in the circumstances.

23     The accused was represented by counsel at the time of his plea of guilt and would have been advised as to the legal consequences of his plea. Given that his counsel had also agreed to prosecution’s submission on sentence, it is now surprising that the accused has nonetheless, decided to appeal against his sentence.

_The accused was sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment._
