Criminal law – Elements of crime – What constitutes a voluntary act for the purpose of attracting criminal liability under the Penal Code?

Criminal law – General defences – Is the common law defence of automatism applicable to an offence under the Penal Code?

14 June 2022 - Judgment reserved.

### District Judge Kow Keng Siong:

## Introduction

1       The accused person, Ong Jun Yong (“**the Accused**”), claimed trial to the following charge (“**the Charge**”):

> You, Ong Jun Yong … are charged that you, on the 23 November 2019, at about 2.30 am, at Zouk Singapore, located at 3C River Valley Road, Clarke Quay, #01-05 to #02-06, The Cannery, Singapore, did use criminal force to \[**the Victim**\], _knowing it to be likely_ that you will outrage her modesty, to wit, by _slipping your hand into her v-neck dress and touching her left breast over her bra_ (“**the Offending Act**”) and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“**Penal Code**”).

> \[emphasis and text in square brackets added\]

## The Defence’s case

2       The Defence’s case regarding the Charge is as follows:[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

> (a)     First, the Accused did not commit the Offending Act.

> (b)     Second, even if the Offending Act is proved to have been committed, the Accused ought to be acquitted because the act was _involuntary_.

>> (i)       The Offending Act was committed _without the Accused’s control_. Specifically, the Accused “was suffering from alcohol intoxication (Acute Alcohol Intoxication) which may have led to reactive hypoglycemia at the material time resulting in a state of automatism”[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) (“**the Accused’s Claim**”).

>> (ii)       The Accused’s Claim is a complete defence to the Charge under the common law defence of non-insane automatism.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3)

>> (iii)       Although the Penal Code does not specifically provide for the automatism defence, this does not preclude the Accused from relying on it. This is because it has been held in _Koh Jing Kwang v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 1 SLR 7</span> (“**_Koh Jing Kwang_**”) at \[44\] that s 39 of the Penal Code – which defines the word “voluntarily” as used in the code – embodies the principle that an act must be voluntary before it can attract criminal liability, and this principle has its roots in the common law concept of automatism.[^4] Some Malaysian courts have also recognised the automatism defence.

## The Prosecution’s case

3       The Prosecution accepted that pursuant to s 39 of the Penal Code and _Koh Jing Kwang_, an accused person cannot be held criminally liable for an involuntary act.[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5)

4       The Prosecution submitted that the Accused’s Claim is legally unsustainable. Their reasons are as follows:

> (a)     An act is involuntary if it is done without the doer _exercising deliberative functions of the mind_. To determine whether an act is involuntary, a court would have to assess the accused person’s actions proximate to the act. If the evidence shows that the accused person is _sufficiently conscious_ of what he is doing, then he cannot be said to be acting involuntarily.[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6)

> (b)     Furthermore, to recognise the Accused’s Claim as exculpatory would be to allow him to circumvent s 85(1) and s 86(2) of the Penal Code. These provisions stipulate that a criminal act induced by an accused person’s voluntary alcohol intoxication cannot be a defence unless the intoxication renders him unable to form the intention needed to constitute the offence.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7)

## Preliminary issues

5       It is common ground between the parties that an accused person can only be held criminally liable for his act under the Penal Code if it is done voluntarily. Put in another way, an accused person is not liable for an involuntary act.

6       The Accused’s defence raises the question of what evidence he must show to establish that the alleged Offending Act was involuntary. During the trial, it was agreed that an early determination on this issue can assist parties to make an informed decision on how to conduct their respective case.

7       Accordingly, after hearing submissions on the issue, I find the applicable principles to be as follows:

> (a)     It is inappropriate to unquestioningly treat the common law defence of automatism as being directly applicable to the Penal Code in determining whether an act is done voluntarily or involuntarily.

> (b)     It is more appropriate to consider how the concept of a voluntary/involuntary act (i) would have been understood at the time the Penal Code was drafted and (ii) had been dealt with under the code.

> (c)     Applying the above approach –

>> (i)       A voluntary act is one done consciously, intentionally _and_ purposefully by the doer.

>> (ii)       An involuntary act is one where the doer is not acting consciously, intentionally, _and/or_ purposefully.

8       The Defence had also raised the legal issue of whether an act committed as a result of a hypoglycaemic attack triggered by voluntary alcohol consumption attracts criminal liability. I decline to determine this issue given the uncertainty regarding the nature and factual basis of the Defence’s case.

## Relevant Penal Code provisions

9       Before explaining my determinations, I wish to highlight that the offence in the present case allegedly took place on 23 November 2019. The Penal Code has been amended several times since then. The analysis in these grounds of decision will be in the context of the Penal Code provisions applicable at the time of the alleged offence. These provisions are set out in **Annex A** at the last column of the tables therein.

## The common law defence of automatism

10     At the outset, it will also be helpful to set out the elements of the common law defence of automatism. In summary, control (or rather, the lack of it) is the foundation of the defence. This defence is available to an accused person if he can establish that his criminal act was committed without his control (“**uncontrolled act**”) and was hence involuntary: _Bratty v AG for Northern Ireland_ <span class="citation">\[1963\] AC 386</span> (“**_Bratty_**”); _R v Cottle_ \[1958\] NZLR 999.

11     The common law distinguishes two types of automatism – insane and non-insane automatism. To establish that his act is involuntary by virtue of non-insane automatism, an accused person has the evidential burden of proving the following:

> (a)     First, he had suffered a _complete loss of control_ over the act: _Attorney-General's Reference (No. 2 of 1992)_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] 3 WLR 982</span>; _Broome v Perkins_ \[1987\] Crim LR 271; _Ryan v R_ (1967) 121 CLR 205; _R v Burr_ \[1969\] NZLR 736. If the accused person had retained some control over the act, then the defence will fail. The mere fact that the accused person could not control his impulses does not mean that he had acted involuntarily: _Bratty_.

> (b)     Second, the loss of control was due to an _external cause_. Examples include reflex action and hypoglycaemia caused by excessive insulin intake: _R v Quick_ <span class="citation">\[1973\] 3 WLR 26</span>. (If the cause of automatism is due to a disease of the accused person’s mind (an internal factor), then this would be a case of insane automatism.)

> (c)     Finally, the accused person’s loss of control was _not_ due to his _own fault or self-induced_. If the cause for the loss of control is the consumption of alcohol or drugs, then the relevant defence to consider would be that of intoxication and not automatism: _R v Bailey_ \[1983\] Crim LR 353.

12     If an accused person is able to discharge his evidential burden, then the Prosecution will have the legal burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he had committed the act voluntarily. A failure to satisfy this legal burden will result in an acquittal.

## My decision

13     Having summarised the common law defence of automatism, I will now explain why I have decided that it is inappropriate to treat the common law defence of automatism as being directly applicable to the Penal Code in determining whether an act is done voluntarily or involuntarily.

#### No local court has held that the common law defence of automatism is available under Singapore criminal law

14     The Defence submitted that _Koh Jing Kwang_ and Malaysian courts have recognised that the automatism defence is applicable to Penal Code offences.

15     I am unable to accept this submission.

16     Turning first to _Koh Jing Kwang_, I note that the Defence had relied on the following passage to support their submission:

> 43    \[…\] The general description of voluntariness in s 39 of the \[Penal Code\] is premised on a more fundamental principle in common law, which is that a person should not be liable for _involuntary behaviour_. This principle has its _roots_ in the common law _concept_ of automatism. As the authors in _Chan, Yeo and Hor_ at para 3.2.2 explain:

>> In general, a person is not liable for _involuntary behaviour_ for the simple reason that he or she has not _done_ anything. At common law, this state is termed ‘_automatism_’. Hence, if there is evidence that _the act_ was _not voluntary_, the accused in effect denies that there was in fact an offence. Lack of voluntariness is not a ‘defence’ as such and it remains the Prosecution’s burden to prove beyond reasonable doubt that _the act_ was in fact voluntary.

> \[emphasis added\]

17     Section 39, which was referred to in _Koh Jing Kwang_, provides that –

> A person is said to cause an effect “voluntarily” when he causes it by means whereby he _intended_ to cause it, or by means which, at the time of employing those means, he _knew or had reason to believe_ to be likely to cause it.

> \[emphasis added\]

18     In my judgment, the Defence is reading too much into _Koh Jing Kwang_. In the _very brief_ passage relied on by the Defence, the High Court was simply referring to the “_concept_” of automatism in very general terms. This was for the purpose of noting that the principle that accused persons should not be liable for involuntary acts has its origins in the common law. Importantly, I note that the High Court –

> (a)     did not go on to analyse the intricacies of the common law defence of automatism – e.g., the distinction between insane and non-insane automatism and the requirements to satisfy the defence of non-insane automatism,

> (b)     did not find that the automatism cases under the common law are directly applicable under Singapore criminal law, and

> (c)     did not determine what constitutes a voluntary/involuntary act under the Penal Code.

19     Next, I turn to the Defence submission that Malaysian courts have recognised the automatism defence. Having reviewed the reported Malaysian cases, my findings are as follows:

> (a)     In _Public Prosecutor v Kenneth Fook Mun Lee (No. 2)_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 3 MLJ 581</span> and _Abdul Razak bin Dalek v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 4 MLJ 725</span>, the courts –

>> (i)       had treated non-insane automatic acts as synonymous with involuntary acts (references were made to s 39 of the Malaysian Penal Code), and

>> (ii)       had equated insane automatic acts with acts of persons of unsound mind (which is a defence under s 84 of the Malaysian Penal Code).

> Regarding (ii), the same position was also taken in _Sinnasamy v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1956\] MLJ 36</span> and _Dourin bin Murah v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 5 MLJ 856</span> at \[15\] – \[18\].

> (b)     The above cases do not appear to be good law anymore based on the most recent reported decision on the automatism defence. In _Hoo Ah Tee v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 4 MLJ 636</span> (“**_Hoo Ah Tee_**”) at \[18\] and \[19\], the Malaysian Court of Appeal had rejected the applicability of the defence to Malaysia criminal law. The court found that the Malaysian Penal Code and other relevant legislation did not specifically provide for the automatism defence.

20     Finally, I am of the view that if the automatism defence is applicable under Singapore criminal law, then it should have been considered extensively in local cases. This is especially so when common law cases have been discussing the automatism defence for the past 70 years – with the first reported English case to use the term “automatism” being _R v Harrison-Owen_ (1951) 39 Cr. App. R. 108, 111 and 112: Brian P. Keene, _The Problem of Automatism_, Auckland University Law Review 15 at 21.

21     However, apart from _Koh Jing Kwang_, only three other local cases have referred to automatism in the criminal context.

> (a)     In _Pathip Selvan s/o Sugumaran v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 4 SLR 453</span> at \[39\], the Court of Appeal had referred to automatism in the context of what needed to be proved to bring an act within _the defence of provocation_ under s 300, Exception 1 of the Penal Code.

> (b)     For the remaining two cases, namely, _Public Prosecutor v Yong Heng Yew_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 3 SLR(R) 22</span> (“**_Yong Heng Yew_**”) at \[10\]; \[14\] and _Bander Yahya A Alzahrani v Public Prosecutor_ \[2018\] 3 SLR 92 at \[27\], the High Court had referred to the concept of automatism only very generally.

> (c)     None of these three cases held that the common law defence of automatism is applicable under Singapore criminal law.

#### Wrong to unquestioningly apply the automatism defence to the Penal Code

22     In my judgment, it is wrong in principle to unquestioningly treat the common law defence of automatism as being directly applicable to the Penal Code offences.

> (a)     Even though some of the Penal Code provisions were based on common law principles (such as s 39 as noted in _Koh Jing Kwang_), it is wrong to shoehorn these principles into the code.

> (b)     At risk of stating the obvious – _Singapore criminal law is based on statute and not the common law_, and the relevant statute in the present case is the Penal Code. Accordingly, to identify the applicable defences and what constitutes a voluntary/involuntary act, one should faithfully interpret the Penal Code within the structure and principles set by its literal text, and not re-write the code or distort its clear language so as to introduce common law principles and defences into our criminal law. This is a very well-established principle of statutory interpretation: _Public Prosecutor v Low Kok Heng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR(R) 183</span> at \[57\]; _Chee Soon Juan v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 648</span> at \[53\] – \[57\]; _Bank of England_ v _Vagliano Brothers_ <span class="citation">\[1891\] AC 107</span> at 145; _Public Prosecutor v Alang Mat Nasir bin Anjang Talib_ <span class="citation">\[1938\] MLJ 153</span>; _Woo Sing & Sim Ah Kow v R_ <span class="citation">\[1954\] MLJ 200</span>; Stanley Yeo, Neil Morgan & Chan Wing Cheong, _Criminal Law in Malaysia and Singapore_ (2018 ed, LexisNexis) (“**_Criminal Law in Malaysia and Singapore_**”) at \[1.57\] and \[1.58\]; Sornarajah, “_The Interpretation of the Penal Codes_” \[1991\] 3 Malayan Law Journal cxxix.

> (c)     It is also trite that the Penal Code is not a codification of the common law. The code is in fact a significant attempt by its drafters to _reform and rationalise_ the English criminal law as they then stood in the late 19th century: _Public Prosecutor v Kwan Kwong Weng_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 1 SLR(R) 316</span> at \[17\]; _Criminal Law in Malaysia and Singapore_ at \[1.35\], \[1.39\], \[1.46\] and \[1.54\]; _Codifying the Criminal Law_, Expert Group on the Codification of the Criminal Law (November 2004), Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Ireland at \[1.47\] and \[1.48\].

> (d)     Furthermore, it bears noting that since its enactment, the Penal Code has gone through a number of amendments. These were introduced by Parliament to ensure that the code meets the needs of modern Singapore. It is clearly inappropriate to blindly apply common law principles to the Penal Code in such circumstances.

> (e)     Section 6 of the Penal Code expressly stipulates that the defences to Penal Code offences are to be found in the Chapter entitled “General Exceptions”. That chapter does not refer to automatism as a defence. This is not surprising given that the automatism defence was developed under the common law only some 80 years _after_ the Penal Code had been drafted: see \[20\] above.

> (f)     Finally, the Penal Code does not provide for the continuing reception of new common law defences – such as the automatism defence[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8) – into the code. This may be contrasted with the criminal codes of other common law jurisdictions relied on by the Defence in their submissions. See for instance the following:

>> (i)       New Zealand, s 20(1) of the Crimes Act 1961

>>> _General rule as to justifications_

>>> All rules and principles of the common law which render any circumstances a justification or excuse for any act or omission, or a defence to any charge, shall remain in force and apply in respect of a charge of any offence, whether under this Act or under any other enactment, except so far as they are altered by or are inconsistent with this Act or any other enactment.

>> (ii)       Canada, s 8(3) of the Criminal Code

>>> _Common law principles continued_

>>> Every rule and principle of the common law that renders any circumstance a justification or excuse for an act or a defence to a charge continues in force and applies in respect of proceedings for an offence under this Act or any other Act of Parliament except in so far as they are altered by or are inconsistent with this Act or any other Act of Parliament.

> (iii)     Tasmania, s 8 of the Criminal Code Act 1924

>>> _Saving of common law defences_

>>> All rules and principles of the common law which render any circumstances a justification or excuse for any act or omission, or a defence to a charge upon indictment, shall remain in force and apply to any defence to a charge upon indictment, except in so far as they are altered by, or are inconsistent with, the Code.

The absence of a clause such as the ones above in the Penal Code shows clearly that its drafters did not intend for the continuing reception of common law defences into Singapore criminal law.

#### The common law and the Penal Code deal with uncontrolled acts differently

23     In my view, it is also impermissible to directly apply the automatism defence locally because the Penal Code does not deal with uncontrolled acts in the same way as the common law.

> (a)     Unlike the common law, the Penal Code does not adopt a binary classification of internal/external causes for the purpose of excusing uncontrolled acts. Instead, the Penal Code stipulates specific circumstances under which an uncontrolled act would be excused: see \[26\] below.

> (b)     The Penal Code has a provision that specifically deals with uncontrolled acts committed by accused persons of unsound mind – s 84. It would be wrong to equate s 84 with insane automatism as there are material differences between the two defences: see e.g., _Hoo Ah Tee_ at \[18\]; Stanley Yeo, _Fleshing out Malaysian Perspectives on Automatism_ SJLS \[2011\] 289, 294; Ferguson, _The Insanity Defence in Canada, Malaysia and Singapore: A Tale of Two Codes_ (1990) 17 Journal of Malaysian and Comparative Law 1 at 4.

#### Issues with the automatism defence

24     Finally, it is relevant to note that the automatism defence has been extensively criticised by courts and commentators. In fact, the English Law Commission has gone so far as to state that the binary divide between internal/external causes for the automatism defence is “illogical”: _Criminal Liability: Insanity and Automatism_ (Discussion Paper, July 2013) at \[1.46\]. The criticisms by the English Law Commission, courts and other commentors are not difficult to understand. The following are some problems with the automatism defence:

> (a)     Diabetes is an internal cause whilst the administration of insulin is an external cause under the classification for automatism. Based on this classification, an accused person with diabetes who fails to take his insulin, and carries out a criminal act in a hyperglycaemic state, is treated as insane. However, if the same accused person adheres to his insulin regime but fails to eat, and carries out the same act in a state of hypoglycaemia, his case will be treated as non-insane automatism. It has been said that “\[t\]here can be no sense in classifying hypoglycaemic states as automatism and hyperglycaemic states as insanity, when both states are so closely associated with a common condition as diabetes”: Andrew Ashworth and Jeremy Horder, _Principles of Criminal Law_ 7th ed (Oxford University Press 2013) at page 94.

> (b)     The lack of clarity with the internal/external cause classification has sometimes produced inconsistent outcomes when applied. For instance, in the case of epilepsy, some courts have regarded it as sane automatism: see e.g., _R._ v. _Charlson_ (1955) 39 Cr. App. R. 37 at 44; _R._ v. _Foy_ \[1960\] Qd. R. 225. Other courts, however, have viewed epilepsy as insane automatism on the basis that it is caused by a species of a disease of the mind: _Hill_ v. _Baxter_ <span class="citation">\[1958\] 1 Q.B. 277</span>, 283; _Bratty_ <span class="citation">\[1963\] A.C. 386</span>; _R._ v. _Meddings_ \[1966\] V.R. 306; _R v. O'Brien_ \[1966\] 56 D.L.R. 2d 65.

25     Given the above, recognising the common law defence of automatism as being applicable would introduce unnecessary complexities into Singapore criminal law.

#### How the Penal Code deals with uncontrolled acts

26     I now turn to how the Penal Code deals with uncontrolled acts. The code provides that such acts – when done in certain specified situations – qualify as defences. These provisions are as follows:

> (a)     An act of person of unsound mind

>> (i)       Section 84(1)(c) of the Penal Code 1871 states –

>>> Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is —

>>>> (a)    incapable of knowing the nature of the act;

>>>> (b)    incapable of knowing that what he is doing is wrong; or

>>>> (c)     _completely deprived of any power to control his actions_.

>>>> \[emphasis added\]

>> (ii)       Section 84(1)(c) was introduced pursuant to recommendations by the Penal Code Review Committee (“**PCRC**”) in 2018. In explaining s 84(1)(c), the PCRC stated the following at page 277 of its 2018 report (“**the Report**”):

>>> 10    The PCRC recommends that the defence be expanded to include _volitional or conative_ disorders. Therefore, someone who is _completely unable to control his actions_ because of a mental disorder, should be allowed a defence.

>>> 11    Those who suffer from such disorders _may_, on account of a mental disorder, _appreciate what they are doing and that what they are doing is wrong or contrary to law_. However, they _may be unable to control their actions_ because of that mental disorder. The PCRC is of the view that there is no good reason why the criminal law should not account for the fundamental principle that _a person is not to be held criminally responsible for involuntary conduct_. In addition, there are no good reasons why the _partial defence of diminished responsibility recognises volitional or conative disorders_ while this defence does not.

>>> \[footnoting deleted, emphasis added\]

> (b)     Grave and sudden provocation

>> Exception 1 to s 300 of the Penal Code and Exception 1 to s 300 of the Penal Code 1871 provide that –

>>> Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender whilst _deprived of the power of self-control_ by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation, or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident.

>>> \[emphasis added\]

> (c)     Diminished responsibility

>> (i)       Exception 7 to s 300 of the Penal Code provides –

>>> Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender was suffering from such abnormality of mind (whether arising from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind or any inherent causes or induced by disease or injury) as _substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts and omissions_ in causing the death or being a party to causing the death.

>>> \[emphasis added\]

>> (ii)       Exception 7 to s 300 of the Penal Code 1871 now provides –

>>> Culpable homicide is not murder if at the time of the acts or omissions causing the death concerned, the offender was suffering from such abnormality of mind (whether arising from a condition of arrested or retarded development or any inherent causes or induced by disease or injury) as substantially —

>>>> (a)    impaired the offender’s capacity —

>>>>> (i)    to know the nature of the acts or omissions in causing the death or in being a party to causing the death; or

>>>>> (ii)   to know whether such acts or omissions are wrong; or

>>>> (b)     _impaired the offender’s power to control his acts or omissions_ in causing the death or being a party to causing the death.

>>> \[emphasis added\]

>> (iii)       The amendment to Exception 7 was made pursuant to recommendation by the PCRC in 2018. In explaining its recommendation, the PCRC made the following observations at page 321 of the Report:

>>> 15     _The majority of us recommend defining diminished responsibility in terms of a substantial impairment of the capacity_ to understand events, to judge whether actions are right or wrong, or _to control those actions._ In this way, we have spelt out what has generally been regarded since _Byrne_ as the essential meaning of "abnormality of mind" under the existing provision. This reformulation omits any reference to a substantial impairment of the accused's "mental responsibility". The term "mental responsibility" is unknown elsewhere in the Penal Code and ambiguous. To be clear, this recommendation is not intended to change the existing law. Rather, it is intended to codify the existing law while omitting the term, "mental responsibility".

>>> \[emphasis added\]

> (d)     Accident in the doing of a lawful act

>> (i)       Section 80 of the Penal Code provides that –

>>> Nothing is an offence which is done by _accident or misfortune_, and _without any criminal intention or knowledge_, in the doing of a lawful act in a lawful manner, by lawful means, and with proper care and caution.

>>> _Illustration_

>>> A is at work with a hatchet; the head flies off and kills a man who is standing by. Here, if there was no want of proper caution on the part of A, his act is excusable and not an offence.

>>> \[emphasis added\]

>> (ii)       Section 80 of the Penal Code 1871 now provides that –

>>> (1)    Nothing is an offence which is done by _accident or misfortune_ in the doing of a lawful act in a lawful manner, by lawful means, and with proper care and caution.

>>> (2)    To avoid doubt, where —

>>>> (a)    a person alleges any act is done by accident or misfortune in the doing of a lawful act in a lawful manner, by lawful means, and with proper care and caution; and

>>>> (b)    the doing of the act allegedly by accident or misfortune may negate the fault element of the offence that the person is charged with,

>>> _the prosecution must prove the fault element_ in order to establish liability under the offence.

>>> _Explanation_. —A lawful act in this section is any act which is not an offence under this Code or any written law and which is not otherwise prohibited by law.

>>> _Illustrations_

>>> (a)    A is at work with a hatchet; the head flies off and kills a man who is standing by. Here, if there was no want of proper caution on the part of A, his act is excusable and not an offence.

>>> (b)    A operates a construction crane and activates a control that causes a heavy load to fall onto B, killing B. A did not act negligently, but his activation of the control caused this result because the construction crane was malfunctioning. A has not committed an offence of causing death by doing a negligent act under section 304A as he did not possess the requisite fault element of negligence.

>>> \[emphasis added\]

>> (iii)       In _R v Ong Choon_ <span class="citation">\[1938\] MLJ 227</span> at 229, the court adopted the following definition of “accident” proposed by James Stephen in his _Digest of Criminal Law_ (Macmillan, 1st Ed, 1877) at Article 316:

>>> \[A\]n effect is said to be accidental when the act by which it is caused is not done with the intention of causing it, and when its occurrence as a consequence of such act is not so probable that a person of ordinary prudence ought, under the circumstances in which it is done, to take reasonable precautions against it.

>> (iv)       Depending on the facts, an accused person can make a case that his uncontrolled act was the result of accident which was beyond his control. This was suggested in _Yong Heng Yew_ at \[14\] and _Public Prosecutor v Lim Niah Liang_ \[1996\] 6 SLR(R) 702 at \[23\].

27     From the above, it is clear that the Penal Code drafters and Parliament had provided that only uncontrolled acts committed in specific scenarios can amount to a defence. If the mere loss of self-control is a defence, then the above defences will have been unnecessary – an accused person can evade criminal liability by simply showing that his criminal act was committed whilst deprived of self-control. There is no need for him to additionally show that his uncontrolled act was due to an unsound mind, grave and sudden provocation, diminished responsibility or an accident.

#### Concept of a voluntary/involuntary act at the time the Penal Code was drafted

28     I now come to the key issue in the present case – i.e., what the Accused must show to establish that the alleged Offending Act was involuntarily.

29     The Penal Code does not define the concept of a voluntary/involuntary act. Contrary to the Defence submission, s 39 merely defines when a doer can be said to have caused an _effect_ voluntarily – _not_ when _an act_ is voluntary.

30     To understand what constitutes a voluntary/involuntary act in the context of the Penal Code, one way is to turn to the writings of eminent jurists on the subject at the time the code was drafted. (Such writings are likely to indicate how the Penal Code drafters would have intended for the concept of a voluntary/involuntary act to be applied in the code. By not giving a legal definition to the concept of a voluntary/involuntary act in the Penal Code, the drafters would presumably have intended for the prevailing common law position on this concept to apply to the code.)

31     One such jurist is James Fitzjames Stephens (“**Stephens**”). In his seminal work, _A History of The Criminal Law of England_ (London, MacMillan 1883) Volume 2 (“**_History_**”) at pages 99 – 107, Stephens provided several illuminating insights into how the concept of a voluntary/involuntary act was understood at the material time.

32     Stephens explained that –

> … Actions may be either involuntary or voluntary, and an involuntary action may be further subdivided according as it is or is not accompanied by consciousness. Instances of involuntary actions are to be found not only in such motions as the beating of the heart and the heaving of the chest, but in many conscious acts – coughing, for instance, the motions which a man makes to save himself from falling, and an infinite number of others. Many acts are involuntary and unconscious, though as far as others are concerned they have all the effects of conscious acts, as, for instance, the struggles of a person in a fit of epilepsy. …

> … \[A\] voluntary act is a motion or group of motions accompanied or preceded by volition and directed towards some object. Every such action comprises the following elements – knowledge, motive, choice, volition, intention; and thoughts, feelings and motions, adapted to execute the intention. These elements occur in the order in which I have enumerated them. … Choice leads to the determination to take some particular course, and this determination issues in a volition … The direction of conduct towards the object chosen is called the intention or aim … Finally, there takes place a series of bodily motions and trains of thought and feeling fitted to the execution of the intention.

> … It would be difficult to attach any meaning to the expression "voluntary action" if either motive or choice, or a volition, or an intention, or actions directed towards its execution were absent, though they may not always be equally well marked. If the motives all act in one direction, and if the only choice is between abstinence from all action and some one definite act, the stages of deliberation and choice may be instantaneous; but if those stages are altogether excluded, the action becomes involuntary. A man who is able to escape from a pressing danger by instantly mounting a horse and galloping away is not likely to be conscious of deliberation or choice, but he does deliberate and does choose. A man who stumbles forward to save himself from falling acts mechanically and cannot be called a voluntary agent in doing so. In the same way if there is no intention, if the movements of the body are not combined or directed to any definite end, there may be action, but it is not voluntary action. …[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9)

33     From the above, it appears that at the time the Penal Code was drafted, the prevailing view was that a voluntary act is one done consciously, intentionally _and_ purposefully by the doer. Conversely, an involuntary act is one where the doer is not acting consciously, intentionally, _and/or_ purposefully. In assessing whether an act is done with these mental elements and is thus voluntary/involuntary, I am of the view that all relevant evidence proximate to the act ought to be considered.

34     Stephens further explained that the opposite of voluntary action is involuntary action – not an act done under “compulsion”. No matter how strong the compulsion is, it does not exclude a voluntary action. Compulsion arises when a person is presented with a choice of evils in which he can avoid great pain only by violating the criminal law. The opposite of compulsion is freedom.[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10) A defence of compulsion should not be available, but it could be taken into account at sentencing.[^11]

35     At this juncture, I digress to point out that in the case of s 354(1) of the Penal Code (i.e., the offence for which the Accused has been charged), the mental elements involved in voluntarily performing the _actus reus_ of the offence is different from the mental element for the offence (i.e., the _mens rea_).[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12) For instance, where the _actus reus_ is the use of criminal force –

> (a)     the mental elements involved in voluntarily performing the act is the conscious, intentional and purposeful use of force, and

> (b)     the _mens rea_ is either the intention to outrage the modesty of the victim or the knowledge that the assault or criminal force is likely to thereby cause such an outrage.

#### Whether an act committed as a result of a hypoglycaemic attack triggered by voluntary alcohol consumption attracts criminal liability

36     The Defence submitted that as a matter of law, the Accused should not be liable for the Charge because his _voluntary_ consumption of alcohol had caused him to _later involuntarily_ commit the Offending Act. This submission is based on the italicised words in s 39 of the Penal Code:

> A person is said to cause an effect “voluntarily” when he causes it by means whereby he intended to cause it, or by means which, _at the time of employing those means, he knew or had reason to believe to be likely to cause it_.

> \[emphasis added\]

According to the Defence, the phrase shows that “the involuntary act must have been subjectively foreseeable by the \[A\]ccused for criminal liability to attach to it”.[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13)

37     The Defence further submits that –

> The accused was not aware at the time of the voluntary consumption of alcohol prior to the alleged offence that he was _prone to hypoglycemia_. Accordingly, he could not possibly have known that the amount of alcohol he consumed _would have led_ to a hypoglycemic attack, _thereby_ causing him to experience a state of automatism. Furthermore, his voluntary consumption of alcohol is too far removed from the _actus reus_ of the alleged offence to reasonably contemplate that that would have been the likely effect.[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14)

> \[emphasis added\]

38     At this stage of the proceedings, I do not find it profitable to determine the legal issue raised by the Defence – i.e., whether an act committed as a result of a hypoglycaemic attack triggered by voluntary alcohol consumption attracts criminal liability.

39     This is because the Defence has failed to present a clear and consistent position regarding whether the alleged Offending Act was committed due to an alleged hypoglycaemia attack caused by voluntary alcohol consumption:

> (a)     On the 1st day of trial, the Defence stated unequivocally that there was a causal link between the voluntary alcohol consumption and the alleged hypoglycaemia attack:[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15)

>> Your Honour, the defence’s position is we are going on the defence of automatism on two grounds. One basically, _he was so intoxicated that he had lost any control over his physical activities_. And also, Your Honour, there is a substrata argument that _he actually was undergoing a hyperglycemic \[hypoglycaemic?\] episode as well_. And so _because of that_, he had no control over his _actus reus_ and as Your Honour has noted, the amended charge itself is---there’s an issue about knowledge and the _mens rea_. So we are basically saying this was done without any _mens rea_ as well as we are saying that even if there was _actus_, which we are not saying there was, the act itself was not with the _mens rea._ So basically, that’s our position, Your Honour.

>> …

>> And the hyperglycemic \[hypoglycaemic?\] episode was _likely caused by_ the intoxication. _That’s what the medical evidence will show_.

>> \[emphasis and words in square brackets added\]

> (b)     However, on the 3rd day of trial, the Defence was equivocal on whether there was a causal link between the voluntary alcohol consumption and the alleged hypoglycaemia attack:[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16)

>

Divanan:

But in this case, _I don’t want to give too much on the report until I get a finalised report_ of Dr Rajesh, Your Honour. But what I can say for now is that, we will be going on the external factor, that is “acute alcohol intoxication”. We will be pushing for “sane automatism”, but we are saying that at that point in time, _there may or might not have been a hypoglycaemic attack_, so to speak, that _aggravated the effects of acute alcohol intoxication_. It’s overlapping, Your Honour.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Okay. Wait, wait. This is where I have some difficult, Mr Divanan.

 |
| 

Divanan:

 | 

Yes, Your Honour?

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Because a fact is a fact, whether your client was suffering from hypoglycaemia or not should be a fact that can be established by now.

 |
| 

Divanan:

 | 

Your Honour, it is; it’s just that _I do not want to say anything on record until it’s finalised_.

> (c)     I note that when cross-examining the various Prosecutions witnesses (including the alleged victim), the Defence’s focus was on discrediting their evidence regarding (i) the commission of the alleged Offending Act and (ii) what had happened that night. The Defence did not put or suggest to these witnesses (i) the Accused’s case regarding his mental state at the material time and (ii) that the alleged Offending Act was committed involuntarily. While I am mindful that it is the Accused’s case that he cannot recall what had happened that night, I would assume that there ought to be minimally some evidence which the Accused would have (e.g., from his companions at the scene who had observed his demeanour and behaviour) regarding his alleged (in)ability to acting voluntarily at the material time.

> (d)     In any event, in their submissions dated 30 May 2022, the Defence took a firm stance that there was a causal link between the voluntary alcohol consumption and the alleged hypoglycaemia attack:

>> (i)       At \[15\] –

>>> “Based on the application of the above analysis, it is submitted that the since the cause was external to the accused person in that he was suffering _acute alcohol intoxication which aggravated the effects of an episode of hypoglycemia_ (which the accused had no knowledge of previously), this case should be classified as one falling under the sane category.” \[emphasis added\]

>> (ii)       At \[32\] –

>>> “The accused suffered a _hypoglycemic attack exacerbated by acute alcohol intoxication_. For the reasons in submitted above, this is treated as a cause of sane automatism.” \[emphasis added\]

>> (iii)       At \[33\] –

>>> “The accused was not aware at the time of the voluntary consumption of alcohol prior to the alleged offence that he was _prone to hypoglycemia_. Accordingly, he could not possibly have known that _the amount of alcohol he consumed would have led to a hypoglycemic attack, thereby causing him to experience a state of automatism_. Furthermore, his voluntary consumption of alcohol is too far removed from the actus reus of the alleged offence to reasonably contemplate that that would have been the likely effect.” \[emphasis added\]

> (e)     Given the unclear position that the Defence had taken throughout the trial on whether there was a causal link, clarification was sought from the Defence regarding the medical basis for their case. The Defence’s clarification injected further uncertainty regarding their case. They stated that –

>> (i)       The cause _is both_ hypoglycaemia and acute alcohol intoxication, _and_

>> (ii)       The Accused was suffering from Acute Alcohol Intoxication “which _may have led to_ reactive hypoclycemia at the material time resulting in a state of automatism”. \[emphasis added\]

> (f)     In the Defence’s Reply to the Prosecution’s Address dated 9 June 2022, the Defence maintained an equivocal stance on whether there was a causal link between the Accused’s voluntary consumption of alcohol and the alleged hypoglycaemia:

>> 20    … emphasized and submitted that the \[A\]ccused is not relying on the defence of intoxication, but rather, the plea of automatism. … \[T\]he \[A\]ccused was suffering from alcohol intoxication (Acute Alcohol Intoxication) which _may have led to_ reactive hypoglycemia at the material time resulting in automatism at the material time. \[emphasis added\]

40     The lack of clarity as to the Accused’s case at this stage of the proceedings is exacerbated by the Defence’s decision not to produce a medical report to unequivocally state what the Accused’s medical condition was at the material time. Presumably, a medical report will be available and there will thus be more clarity on the issue, if and when the Accused’s defence is called.

41     That said, given the current uncertainty regarding factual premise and nature of the Defence’s case, it is inadvisable for me to render a determination on the issue of whether an act committed as a result of a hypoglycaemic attack triggered by voluntary alcohol consumption attracts criminal liability. A court does not act in vain: _Vellama d/o Marie Muthu v Attorney-General_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 4 SLR 1</span> at \[53\]; _Tan Ng Kuang Nicky (the duly appointed joint and several liquidator of Sembawang Engineers and Constructors Pte Ltd (in compulsory liquidation)) and others v Metax Eco Solutions Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 1 SLR 1135</span> at \[85\] and \[88\]. It is best that a determination on the issue be made after the Accused has given evidence and his evidence stress-tested, assuming that his defence is called.

## Conclusion

42     The matter has since been fixed for pre-trial conference for parties to obtain further hearing dates.
