### District Judge Eddy Tham Tong Kong:

1       The Accused pleaded guilty before me to three charges, namely:

> DAC 909602/2018

> “that you, sometime between April 2016 to the 20th day of June 2016, …being a member of the employer’s household, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Rasi, a domestic maid employed by one Edmond Ting Chee Teng to work at his household, to wit, by punching her back and eyes and hitting her head with a plastic bowl, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 323 read with section 73(2) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Rev. Ed)..”;

> DAC 909605/2018

> “that you, sometime between April 2016 to the 20th day of June 2016, …, being a member of the employer’s household, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Rasi, a domestic maid employed by one Edmond Ting Chee Teng to work at his household, to wit, by punching her eyes multiple times and pinching her ears, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 323 read with Section 73(2) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Rev. Ed)”; and

> DAC 909606/2018

> “that you, sometime between April 2016 to the 20th day of June 2016, …, being a member of the employer’s household, did voluntarily cause grievous hurt to one Rasi, a domestic maid employed by one Edmond Ting Chee Teng to work at his household, to wit, by punching her multiple times on her nose, causing her to suffer right nasal bone fracture and right nasal septal haematoma, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 325 read with Section 73(2) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Rev. Ed).

2       Four other charges of voluntarily causing hurt to the same domestic helper, Rais, were taken into consideration.

3       I sentenced the Accused to three terms of imprisonment: 3 months, 5 months and 12 months, respectively with the 3-month sentence to run consecutively with the 12-month sentence, giving a total of 15 months’ imprisonment.

4       The Prosecution being dissatisfied with the sentence has filed an appeal against it. The Accused is currently serving her sentence.

5       I now set out my grounds of decision for the sentence.

#### The Statement of Facts

6       The Accused is Chan Yun Hui Jenny, a 41-year-old female Singapore citizen.

7       The victim is Rasi (“the Victim”), an Indonesia National. At the material time, she was 27 years old and was the domestic maid employed by the Accused’s husband, Edmond Ting Chee Teng and was working and residing at the residence of the Accused (“the Unit”).

8       The Accused was a member of the Victim’s employer’s household at the material time.

#### First Information Report

9       On 20 June 2016, at about 10.30am, after the Accused left the Unit for work, the Victim took her belongings and left the Unit to seek assistance at the Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia (“the Embassy”). The Embassy then referred the Victim to the Police for assistance.

10     Later that day, at about 10.47am, the Victim went to Bukit Timah Neighbourhood Police Centre and reported that she had been assaulted by the Accused. The police officer on duty created an incident report stating the following: “One female subject walked into NPC, injured. Required ambulance.”

#### Background information and facts pertaining to all charges

11     The Victim started working for the Accused’s household in February 2016. Her duties included cleaning the Unit, cooking the family’s meals, and washing and ironing clothes. The Accused required the Victim to wake up at about 6am to perform her chores. She gave the Victim a strict schedule of tasks to follow, and would monitor the Victim through multiple Closed Circuit Televisions (“CCTVs”) installed throughout the unit. The Victim did not have enough rest and often fell asleep whilst performing her chores, causing the Accused to be angry at her and scold her. The Accused starting physically assaulting the Victim two months into her employment, sometime in April 2016.

12     The Victim did not own a mobile phone, and was not allowed to use a phone. She was also not allowed to speak to the neighbours. On 19 June 2016, the Victim managed to speak to another maid who resided in the opposite unit while she was in the balcony. The other maid told the Victim that she could take a taxi to the Embassy to get help. The Victim did so accordingly the next day, on 20 June 2016.

13     The Victim was hospitalized in Tan Tock Seng Hospital from 20 to 22 June 2016. According to the medical report dated 2 August 2016 prepared by Dr Adrien Carle, the Victim sustained the following injuries:

> a.     vertex cephalohaematoma;

> b.     hair loss patch;

> c.     bilateral antihelix abrasions;

> d.     bilateral periorbital haematomas;

> e.     face swellings;

> f.     right nasal bone fracture seen on brain and face CT-scan performed on the day of admission; right nasal septal haematoma treated by incision and insertion of a drain;

> g.     pinch marks on the arms;

> h.     multiple bruises on the arms;

> i.     multiple chest bruises and abrasion; and

> j.     back abrasion.

14     The above injuries were caused by the Accused’s physical abuse of the Victim.

#### Facts relating to the 2nd charge (DAC-909602-2018)

15     Sometime between April 2016 and 20 June 2016, at about 6am, in the Unit, the Victim woke up to clean the kitchen and to prepare food. The Accused was upset at the Victim as the latter had not finished her morning chores. Although the Victim apologized to her, the Accused punched the Victim in the eye. When the Victim was cleaning the kitchen floor, the Accused hit the Victim’s back with her hand. The Accused further hit the back of the Victim’s head with a plastic bowl, causing the Victim’s head to bleed.

16     The Accused rinsed off the Victim’s blood using a shower head. The Victim then changed her clothes and the Accused applied medicated oil on the Victim’s head. She did not bring the Victim to seek medical attention.

17     By virtue of the foregoing, the Accused has committed an offence punishable under s 323 read with s 73(2) of the Penal Code.

#### Facts relating to the 5th charge (DAC-909605-2018)

18     Sometime between April 2016 and 20 June 2016, the Victim decided to flee the Unit as she could no longer tolerate the physical abuse by the Accused. She decided to clean the toilet before leaving the Unit. However, the Accused returned to the Unit and asked the Victim why she had cleaned the toilet first instead of the bedroom in accordance with the schedule. The Victim then told the Accused that she intended to leave the Unit for good. The Accused became very angry on hearing this and assaulted the Victim (DAC-909604-2018, a charge taken into consideration). The Accused then ordered the Victim to clean the floor. She later gave the Victim some medication and told the Victim not to tell the Accused’s husband that she had returned home early. The Accused also told the Victim that if she ran away, she would call the Police and put her in jail for 20 years. The Victim was afraid that she would not be able to see her son again after hearing this.

19     Later that same day, the Accused was angry at the Victim for falling asleep while she was cleaning the room. She thus pinched the Victim’s ears with her finger nails, causing her nails to dig into the Victim’s ears. This caused the Victim’s ears to bleed. The Accused also punched the Victim’s eyes multiple times, until the Victim’s left eye was so swollen that she was unable to see using her left eye for about 30 minutes. The Accused later placed cotton wool on the Victim’s left eye and applied medicated oil on the Victim’s ears. She did not bring the Victim to seek medical attention.

20     By virtue of the foregoing, the Accused has committed an offence punishable under s 323 read with s 73(2) of the Penal Code.

#### Facts relating to the 6th charge (DAC-909606-2018)

21     Sometime between April 2016 and 20 June 2016, in the Unit, the Accused was angry with the Victim as the latter had woken up late. She thus punched the Victim’s nose several times. The Victim was unable to breathe through her nose and told the Accused as such. However, the Accused continued to punch her. The Accused did not bring the Victim to seek medical attention. The Victim sustained a right nasal bone fracture.

22     By virtue of the foregoing, the Accused has committed an offence punishable under s 325 read with s 73(2) of the Penal Code.

#### Antecedent records

23     The Accused does not have any previous convictions.

#### Newton Hearing on the effect of the psychiatric disorder

24     The Prosecution did not dispute that the Accused was suffering from Major Depressive Disorder (“MDD”) at the material time but submitted that the psychiatric condition of the Accused should not be given any mitigatory value as the Defence has failed to establish a causal or significant contributory link between her condition and her offending behaviour.

25     A Newton hearing was conducted on this issue as the Defence psychiatrist, Dr Ung Eng Khean (“Dr Ung”), and the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) psychiatrist, Dr Yeo Chen Kuan Derrick (“Dr Yeo”) disagreed on two matters:

> (a)     the severity of the Accused’s MDD at the material time; and

> (b)     the degree to which it contributed to or caused her to commit the offences.

26     On the issue of severity, Dr Ung opined that the Accused’s MDD was “moderate to severe” whilst Dr Yeo was of the view that the Accused’s MDD was of moderate severity as her socio-occupational functionality was only partially affected.

27     On the issue of degree the MDD had contributed to the offending, Dr Ung found a “direct causal relationship” between the Accused’s MDD and her being more easily angered and irritable with Rasi, and this condition may have manifested in “her being physically aggressive” to Rasi.

28     In his supplementary report dated 22 October 2018, Dr Ung clarified that while her psychiatric condition could not be said to be the “direct cause” for her commission of the offences, he had opined that the Accused’s MDD caused a substantial diminution in her ability to exercise self-control at the time of her commission of the offences.

29     Dr Yeo, on the other hand, opined that there was only “some contributory link” between the Accused’s MDD and her commission of the offences, and the Accused did not suffer from any significant volitional impairment in her ability to control her criminal behaviour.

#### Prosecution’s submissions on the Newton Hearing

30     The Prosecution submitted firstly that the Defence bears the burden of proof to show that the Accused was suffering from a psychiatric condition that had substantially contributed to her commission of the offence before any significant mitigating weight can be given to the psychiatric condition. This position was not challenged by the Defence and I had adopted this approach.

31     The Prosecution then went on to submit that Dr Ung’s findings on this matter should be disregarded on the following grounds:

> a.     he was partisan and contrived in that he had openly advocated for the Accused when he said he was seeking to explain the Accused’s behaviour in mitigation of her actions as well opining that the Accused was a suitable candidate for a Mandatory Treatment Order when he was not the appointed psychiatrist;

> b.     his report was unbalanced in that it carried large portions of the Accused’s long history of mental state but carried only a pithy discussion of the Accused’s state of mind in the relevant period of the commission of the offences;

> c.     he cherry-picked certain sections of articles that purportedly supported the positions he was trying to advance and omitted other sections within the articles themselves that contradicted or qualified the selected sections; in short, the medical literature cited by Dr Ung fails to establish any link between depression and use of physical violence or that MDD reduces self-control;

> d.     he chose for some inexplicable reasons to state that the severity of the Accused’s psychiatric condition was “moderate to severe” even though the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (“DSM-5”) does not provide for this range of “moderate to severe” ;

> e.     his neutrality has been compromised by being the Accused’s treating psychiatrist since 2016 and has been the treating psychiatrist for almost 2 years prior to preparation of his report;

> f.     his report was devoid of reasons for the conclusion he arrived on the severity of the Accused’s MDD;

> g.     his report contained very few details as to commission of the offences as set out in the charges and thus failed to address how the Accused’s MDD had contributed to her offending actions;

> h.     Dr Ung had relied on a patient self-rated PHQ-9 questionnaire to rate her symptoms she had experienced about 2 years earlier. Furthermore such self-rated assessment is open to bias and is more of a clinical rather than a forensic tool.

#### Defence submissions on the Newton Hearing

32     On the other hand, the Defence submitted that Dr Ung’s opinion that the Accused’s “depressive disorder caused a substantial diminution in her ability to exercise self-control at the time of the offences”[^1] should be preferred to Dr Yeo’s opinion that the Accused “did not suffer from any significant volitional impairment to control her criminal behaviour”[^2] for the following reasons:

> a.     Dr Yeo during cross-examination conceded that the Accused’s MDD did affect her ability to exercise self-control to some degree which would have led to her loss of self-control;

> b.     Dr Yeo relied on irrelevant considerations to justify his opinion by conceding that ability to perceive alternatives is irrelevant to issue of self-control and also backed down from his position that the Accused had planned the place of his attack;

> c.     Dr Yeo made numerous mistakes that would have been apparent in his report, calling into question the level of preparedness and diligence Dr Yeo had put into assessing the Accused. The mistakes highlighted are as follow:

>> i.       stated the age of the Accused to be 44 when she was in fact 41 years old at time of the assessment;

>> ii.       stated the occupation of the Accused to be an administrative staff in a medical clinic when she had in fact worked as a sales and marketing manager;

>> iii.       stated that the Accused was in her second marriage when she had only one marriage and continues to be married to her husband;

>> iv.       stated that the Accused had a diploma in nursing when she in fact had a diploma in health science; and

>> v.       stated that the Accused had a happy childhood when in fact she had endured a history of childhood trauma and abuse.

> d.     Dr Yeo’s views were completely unsubstantiated in that he did not cite any scientific studies or literature;

> e.     Dr Yeo’s assessment of the Accused was far less thorough that Dr Ung’s as he had spent much less time and conducted fewer sessions with the Accused compared with Dr Ung; and

> f.     Dr Yeo was inadequately prepared for his first session with the Accused in that he did not read prior medical assessments of the Accused which would be his usual practice when interviewing a patient for the first time.

#### The Court’s finding on the degree of severity of the Accused’s MDD

33     Upon conclusion of the Newton Hearing, on the first issue of the degree of severity of the Accused’s MDD, I have no difficulty in finding that the Accused’s condition should be described as MDD of moderate severity. It is undisputed that DSM-5 serves as the principal authority for psychiatric diagnoses and had been referred to by both the expert witnesses. It was also unchallenged that the latest version, ie the 5th Edition was published in 2013 by the American Psychiatric Association[^3] and hence DSM-5 should be the latest text which should be used and not DSM-4.

34     In DSM-5, there are 3 categories of MDD set out. The following excerpt from DSM-5 was reproduced in Dr Ung’s report[^4] as follows:

> “Severity is based on the number of criterion symptoms, the severity of those symptoms and the degree of functional disability.

>> **Mild:** Few, if any, symptoms in excess of those required to make the diagnosis are present, the intensity of the symptoms is distressing but manageable, and the symptoms result in minor impairment in social and occupational functioning.

>> **Moderate:** The number of symptoms, intensity of symptoms, and/or functional impairment are between those specified for “mild” and “severe”.

>> **Severe:** The number of symptoms is substantially in excess of that required to make the diagnosis, the intensity of the symptoms is seriously distressing and unmanageable, and the symptoms markedly interfere with social and occupational functioning”.

35     Dr Ung despite agreeing that there were only 3 ranges stipulated in DSM-5 with no “moderate to severe” category still insisted on classifying the Accused to be in this category. In my view, the classification of “moderate” which states that it is between those specified for “mild” and “severe” clearly encompasses anything that is between moderate to severe and there is really no need to have another new category of moderate to severe.

36     Defence Counsel tried to show that previous psychiatrist reports tendered in court did give a diagnosis of “moderate to severe” but these were established to have been proffered before 2013 under DSM-4 where such a category existed. Dr Ung was hard pressed to put forth a reason why he persisted with such a category where none existed under the latest edition DSM-5.

37     At the end of the day, what is undisputed is that based on Dr Ung’s own findings that the severity is below that of “severe” and above that of “moderate”. Accordingly, the correct classification under DSM-5 would be that of “moderate” severity.

#### The Court’s finding on the effect of the Accused’s MDD on her offending behaviour

38     Moving onto the effect of the psychiatric condition on the Accused, I found that I am in more agreement with the opinion rendered by Dr Yeo, that there was indeed ‘some contributory link’ between the Accused’s MDD and the commission of the offences as “irritability and poor judgement are characteristics of such a psychiatric disorder and would have played a role in leading to her losing her temper more easily with the maid (irritability) and not fully considering the consequences of her behaviour towards the maid (poor judgement)”[^5].

39     I found that Dr Yeo’s explanation more congruent with the facts of the case; that these traits would cause the Accused to lose her temper more easily which is only “to the start of the offences”[^6], but this does not necessarily result therefore in losing volitional control over her behaviour resulting from the loss of temper.

40     It is one thing to lose one’s temper leading to outbursts of emotions and quite another to inflict physical violence. No doubt, the latter flows from the former but the question is whether the Accused who is suffering from MDD in the moderate range of severity was still able to exercise self-control and is cognitive of her actions.

41     In this regard, Dr Ung’s view when cross-examined did not differ too significantly. I reproduce the relevant questions and answers given:

> “Q    The crux of it is the link between the disorder and the offence. A person can have a condition but that doesn’t necessarily mean that that would have a causal link to the offence or affect her self-control.

> A     **Well, I agree** and that’s why when you look back longitudinally, uh, and track the onset of the depression and the various changes, then there is this change. I mean, yes, I mean, some people are by virtue of their personality, just violent, that is true or some people have no mental illness, uh, and are violent. Some people are not by nature violent, um, but then, because of a condition such as depression, they can then manifest violence or aggression.

> Q    And there are also people with mental condition, but there’s just no link to the offending behaviour.

> A     **Oh, I fully agree, I fully agree**. I---that’s why I---you know, **I’m not saying that depression causes physical aggression or violence, it may though****.** Um, but as you said, you know, sort of \[inaudible\] on in every case”.[^7]

42     Dr Ung’s view is thus that clinical depression does not cause physical aggression or violence in every case. He went on to say that whilst depression did not cause the Accused to commit violent acts against the Victim, it nonetheless “significantly contributed to reducing her self-control, giving her poorer judgement and increasing her anger which resulted in her causing the offence and it is \[his\] opinion that, had she not have any depressive disorder, then on the basis of probability, she wouldn’t have acted the way she did”.[^8]

43     Dr Ung went to explain the link between self-control and depression. He expressed the opinion that depression leads a person becoming more easily irritable and angry which in turns lead to poorer judgement and when a person is more irritable and angry, it becomes harder to control oneself. In his own words, “if one is more impulsive and has a lower level of self-control, again one might be more likely to behave in an undesirable way. If one has poorer decision-making capability, then again, you know, one might end up making poorer choices, leading to undesirable actions”.[^9]

44     I therefore found that conceptually, Dr Ung’s opinion did not differ significantly from Dr Yeo as Dr Yeo had similarly expressed a link between the disorder, irritability and poor judgement as set out at \[39\] above.

45     What is crucial is that despite labouring under such a disorder, the Accused still had cognitive capacity and would have been aware of alternative choices as well as the consequences of her actions. While she had claimed that her own performance at work had been affected as told to her psychiatrists, leading to more stress, nonetheless she was still able to continue to work daily in a senior managerial position.

46     Dr Ung agreed that the Accused was able to have cognitive capacity on what she had done to the victim and that she was also aware of her possible choices and alternatives in response to any given situation. In other words, Dr Ung was of the view that the Accused was not so affected that she was behaving like “an automaton”. I reproduce here another excerpt of the cross-examination of Dr Ung:

> “Q    But that doesn’t mean that they can’t control their actions.

> A    Oh, yah. We---I agree---I agree. It doesn’t mean that people can’t choose as she’s not as I said an automaton where, you know, there’s no ability to---to choose, uh, to think.”[^10]

47     Dr Ung also agreed with Prosecution that based on the details set out in the Statement of Facts, the Accused was not behaving irrationally or was psychotic. Her actions were goal oriented and clearly targeted at the Victim due to her being angry with the Victim’s poor performance[^11].

48     To sum up, Dr Ung’s view is that the Accused’s MDD had diminished her ability to control her actions, as a result of her greater irritability and anger.

49     Under clarification from questions by the Court, Dr Ung was also of the view that in between each episode of attack, the Accused, when not in a state of heightened anger, would be able to reflect on her actions and the harm caused to the Victim[^12].

50     I found therefore from the Newton hearing, that in essence, there was a lot of common ground in the opinions of the 2 psychiatrists and that I was able to accept their opinions broadly. Any difference in their opinions were really more in the phraseology of the words used such as the word “significantly contributed” but in substance, they do not differ greatly.

51     I was able to conclude that the Accused’s offending behaviour was indeed contributed by her MDD in that it had caused her to be more easily irritable and angry leading to her making poorer judgements. However, her culpability for her actions was still high. She clearly knew what she was doing when she chose to inflict violence repeatedly on the Victim. She clearly had control of her mind and actions. Her actions were very goal-directed. She hit the Victim on the head with a bowl, she pinched her on her ears and punched her on her eyes and nose. She wanted to cause hurt and pain to the Victim because she was angry with her and for no other reasons.

52     Crucially, between each episode of anger and in fact shortly after each act of violence, she was conscious and alive to the consequences of her actions. She took remedial actions such as rinsing off the blood on the Victim’s head and applying medicated oil on the Victim’s injuries. She had the presence of mind to warn the Victim not to tell her husband that she had been home earlier. She also warned the Victim of dire consequences if the Victim ran away from home.

53     She would also have been able to reflect on the horror of her actions. As Dr Ung clarified, in between episodes when her anger has died down, she would be able to reflect on what she had done to the Victim. Consequently, the Accused ought to have also realised her tendency to resort to violence whenever she became angry with the Victim.

54     The Accused thus would have been able to realise that her behaviour after each episode of violence that her behaviour as a result of being angry with the Victim was wholly unacceptable. She had the capacity to do something about it. One alternative is for her to change her maid. She knew this option was available as she had done so on 6 other earlier occasions and had discussed this issue with her husband. However, she made a conscious decision that she would not change her maid as that would have financial implications for her. She was content to leave the unacceptable situation as it is.

55     Despite my acceptance of Dr Yeo’s opinion on this issue, I nonetheless wish to express my concerns with the numerous glaring mistakes highlighted by Defence Counsel in Dr Yeo’s report. The numerous errors did call into question the level of care that had gone into the preparation of the report. Ultimately, those errors did not have a material impact on conclusions reached and as I have pointed out did not differ too much from those rendered by Dr Ung. However, certainly greater care need to be exercised in future as such reports do play a crucial role in the outcome of many cases.

#### The sentencing principles

56     Based on my findings on the effect of MDD on her and her degree of cognitive capacity and culpability, I found that the principles of deterrence and retribution laid down in the case of _ADF v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 1 SLR 874</span> for maid abuse still hold sway. The Accused’s mental condition whilst contributing to her offending behaviour, had no causal link and did not substantially diminish her criminal responsibility. The Victim in the present case belongs to a vulnerable class of our society that needs special protection from abusive employers and hence a deterrent sentence would be warranted.

57     In the present case, the custodial threshold has clearly been crossed based on the number of occasions as well as the degree of hurt caused for each of the proceeded charge. As set out at _ADF_, a custodial sentence would invariably be warranted in cases where physical violence had been inflicted on domestic workers–\[91\]. However, the imprisonment term would have to be calibrated downwards in the present case in view of the effect of the Accused’s MDD.

58     Sentencing framework for maid abuse offences punishable under section 323 read with section 73(2) of the Penal Code has been laid down in the case of _Tay Wee Kiat and anor v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 1315</span>, which is a 4-step approach (at \[70\]-\[75\]):

> i.     determine whether the harm caused to the victim was predominantly physical, or both physical and psychological;

> ii.     identify the degree of harm caused in relation to each charge. Where both physical and psychological harm have resulted, the sentencing range should start at the level of months rather than days with the following table setting out the indicative ranges corresponding to the degree of harm caused:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="33.3333333333333%"> <col width="33.3333333333333%"> <col width="33.3333333333333%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Less serious physical harm</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">More serious physical harm</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Less serious psychological harm</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3-6 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6-18 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">More serious psychological harm</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6-18 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">20-30 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

> iii.     adjust the sentence for each charge in the light of other aggravating or mitigating circumstances; and

> iv.     having determined the sentences for each charge, decide on which sentences are to run consecutively and which concurrently, in accordance with the principles set out in _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP_ \[2014\]2 SLR 988 at \[27\]-\[82\].

#### Sentencing the two section 323 read with section 73(2) of the Penal Code cases

59     In _DAC 909602/2008_, the Accused had hit the Victim on her back, punched her eye and thereafter hit her head with a plastic bowl causing her head to bleed. In terms of physical harm, other than the bleeding casued by being hit with a plastic bowl, the injuries appear to be relatively minor and would fall within the category of less serious physical and psychological harm and thus within the sentencing range of 3-6 months.

60     Whilst it was not a very prolonged assault, the punch to the eye as well as the hit on the head with a plastic bowl with sufficient force to cause bleeding would nonetheless bring the sentence to above the starting point of 3 months, in the region of 4 months. The sentence of 4 months would be in line also with the sentence meted out in the case of _Tay Wee Kiat_, where the offender had used a bamboo stick to hit the victim multiple times on the head despite her pleas to ask him to stop. The offender was sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment for this offence. In my view, using a bamboo stick to hit the head multiple times would clearly cause greater harm and damage than what the present Accused did.

61     The Prosecution had emphasised that an implement was used to hit the Victim. However, I note that a plastic bowl was not inherently a very dangerous weapon and the Accused had probably used it spontaneously due to it being within easy reach. The harm that could be caused by a plastic bowl would be limited. Hence I did not give too much of a weightage to the fact that the Accused had used an object to hit the Victim. Hence, I disagreed with Prosecution’s submission that the sentence should be pitched at the higher end of the spectrum of 6 months’ imprisonment. On the other hand, the Defence’s submission that the appropriate sentence should only be a fine is clearly out of the question given the degree of physical harm caused by the Accused.

62     As for the next charge, DAC 909605/2018, the degree of harm both physical and psychological would be greater.

63     The Accused had pinched the Victim’s ears with her finger nails by digging them into the Victim’s ears until the ears bled. She then punched the Victim’s eyes several times until the Victim’s left eye was so swollen that she could not see for 30 minutes.

64     The degree of trauma experienced both in terms of pain and shock as well as psychological harm caused would clearly be significant.

65     Nonetheless, I would not consider that it would clearly fall into the more serious physical or psychological harm category. There is no medical record to state that any of these injuries caused were permanent or that the visual impairment of the eye went beyond the 30 minutes.

66     I would thus still place the harm caused for this charge to be within the range of 3-6 months’ imprisonment. However, in view of the greater degree of harm caused, I would consider this to be on the highest end of this category, warranting a custodial sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment.

67     This sentence is again comparable to what was meted out in a recent maid abuse case. In the case of _Public Prosecutor v Lee Siew Choon_ MA 9045/2019, the offender had punched the domestic helper in the eye causing blurred vision, then hit her arm with a wooden pole followed by pinching of her hand. The offender was suffering from adjustment disorder which had contributed to her being in a state of irritability and frustration. On appeal, her sentence for this charge was increased to 4.5 months.

68     I thus disagree with the Prosecution’s submission that the physical harm was so great that it fell within the band of more serious physical harm. I also disagree with the Defence Counsel’s submission that a high fine is adequate due to the much greater harm caused by the Accused for this charge.

69     I move now to the final charge where grievous hurt was caused, in the form of a fractured nasal bone, DAC 909606/2018. The Accused, upset with the Victim for waking up late, had punched her repeatedly on the nose and persisted with the punches despite the Victim saying that she was unable to breathe. This vicious attack resulted in the Victim sustaining a right nasal bone fracture.

70     The Prosecution had relied on a set of indicative sentencing range for an offence under section 325 read with section 73(2) of the Penal Code adopted by a District Judge in _Public Prosecutor v Zariah Binte Mohd Ali and anor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 173</span>. The learned District Judge had extrapolated the sentencing ranges in _Tay Wee Kiat_ using a multiplier of 5 since the maximum punishment for an offence under section 325 read with section 73(2) of the Penal Code is 5 times that of the maximum punishment for an offence under section 323 read with section 73(2) of the Penal Code.

71     Applying this extrapolated sentencing bands, the Prosecution submitted that for this charge, the sentencing range would be from 15 to 30 months’ imprisonment as the acts of the Accused would fall within the category of less serious physical and psychological harm. The Prosecution then submitted that the sentence ought to be 18 months, in the lower end of this sentencing band. On the other hand, the Defence had asked for a sentence of 4 months’ imprisonment.

72     Whilst I am aware that extrapolation of sentencing bands had been done for drug trafficking offences based on the weight of the controlled drugs trafficked, I am not so certain that a straight multiplier of 5 in the present case should be applied as the starting point for such an offence. Doing so would cause the starting point to be at 15 months’ imprisonment, which appears to be on the high side. The degree of grievous hurt ranges very widely. On one end of the spectrum can lie very low level of grievous hurt caused where a patient can be given an immediate discharge on the same day with outpatient treatment.

73     I therefore would not follow such an extrapolation in this case. In terms of the degree of harm of grievous hurt, I would consider the nasal bone fracture as one of the least severe form of fracture. There is some support for such a view in the case of _Low Song Chye v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 140</span>, where the High Court had commented that a nasal bone fracture “may be said to be a less severe form of grievous hurt” at \[91\]. A starting point of 12 months’ imprisonment would be in my view sufficient taking into account that the Victim is a domestic worker for a nasal bone fracture.

74     Considering the brutality of the attack in that the Accused did not stop punching the Victim even after the Victim had told her she could not breathe, I would increase the sentence to 14 months’ imprisonment.

#### 3rd step in the sentencing framework

75     In applying the 3rd step of the _Tay Wee Kiat_ sentencing framework, I found the following aggravating factors present:

> i.     employment conditions imposed by the Accused forbidding the Victim from using a phone or speaking with her neighbours heightened the sense of helplessness and vulnerability of the Victim;

> ii.     threat made by the Accused that she would call for the police if she ran away and get the Victim imprisoned for 20 years had caused greater mental and emotional distress to the Victim resulting in a greater sense of feeling trapped in the situation. The threat had put the Victim in genuine fear that she might not be able to see her son again. The fact that she did eventually talk to another maid and took the courage to run away to make a report does not negate the fact that she had endured in silence for almost 2 months the physical abuse inflicted on her; and

> iii.     the charges taken into consideration clearly constitue an aggravating factor. The four charges involve assaults which could not be said to be trivial. The offending acts comprised punching of the Victim’s eye, slapping multiple times on the face, kicking her on the back of her head, pinching on arm and chest and dragging her out of the room by her hair. Photographs produced by the prosecution show scars left behind by the pinching on both the arms of the Victim as well as a hair loss patch on the scalp as a result of being dragged by the hair. Together these acts would warrant an uplift in the overall sentence to be imposed.

76     On the other hand, I found the following mitigating factors:

> i.     the Accused had pleaded guilty;

> ii.     the Accused has an unblemished record in terms of any previous court convictions;

> iii.     the Accused had made voluntary compensation of $8,330 to the Victim to ameliorate the harm caused; and

> iv.     in two of the proceeded charges, the Accused did try to treat the injuries sustained by the Victim by washing off the blood and applying medicated oil on the injuries; and

> v.     the effect of the mental disorder of MDD on her offending behaviour which had been untreated until the offences came to light. I have found that the MDD did cause the Accused to be more irritable and to exercise poorer judgement.

> vi.     Dr Yeo also opined that the effect of imprisonment which would necessarily mean separation from her husband and her two 6-year old twin girls, would “likely lead to a deterioration of her mental state”[^13]. Dr Ung was also in agreement with such a conclusion.

77     The Prosecution had asked for a global imprisonment of 24 months, with the 6-month sentence for DAC 909602/2018 to run consecutively with the 18-month sentence for DAC 909606/2018. They then submitted, taking into account both aggravating and mitigating factors, for the sentence to be calibrated down by 4 months to 20 months’ imprisonment.

78     The Defence position is for maximum fine of $7,500 for each section 323 read with section 73(2) of the Penal Code, or alternatively, a short 2-week imprisonment term. Hence, the appropriate global sentence submitted by the Defence is at most imprisonment of 4 months and 2 weeks.

79     As set out above, I found that the individual sentences for each of the three proceeded charges are 4 months, 6 months and 14 months’ respectively. Taking into account both the aggravating factors as well as the mitigating factors, I found that on balance, the mitigating factors have tilted towards reducing the individual sentences of imprisonment slightly. Accordingly, I have calibrated the custodial sentences downwards to 3 months, 5 months and 12 months.

80     Applying the 4th step of the framework, I found that ordering the 3-month sentence to run with the 12-month sentence, giving a global sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment, would be an appropriate sentence, achieving both general and specific deterrence, whilst giving sufficient weight to the mitigating factors present.

#### Conclusion

81     The Accused did suffer from MDD, brought about by multiple stressors that accumulated since the birth of her premature twins. Her condition had affected her work performance and she became increasingly melancholic, irritable and prone to losing her temper. However, she was still able to control herself with regard to the earlier six maids in that for those who did not meet her work expectations, she had sent them home or back to the maid agency without resorting to violence. Unfortunately, for the last maid, the Victim, the Accused did not exercise such restraint and had repeatedly assaulted her whenever she lost her temper. She clearly knew it was wrong but continued to do so, over a 2-month period when she vented her anger over any perceived shortcomings on the Victim’s performance with explosive violence.

82     The injuries caused were extensive, with the most severe in the form of a fractured nasal bone. Fortunately, none of the injuries appear to be permanent and over time should completely resolve themselves. The Accused had shown genuine remorse in pleading guilty and made voluntary compensation. She has also, after the offences had been brought to light, gone to seek psychiatric assessment and treatment.

83     The Accused clearly had the capacity to control her actions and her increased irritability cannot be an excuse that will condone her actions. For that, she has to pay a heavy price, both personally as well as for her young family. In sentencing her, I have calibrated the imprisonment sentence downwards to take into account her psychiatric condition as well as the remorse she has since shown.

84     Her medical reports have been forwarded to Prison so that appropriate treatment can be rendered by the Prison psychiatrists to minimise the adverse effect imprisonment will have on her psychiatric disorder as she serves out her sentence.
