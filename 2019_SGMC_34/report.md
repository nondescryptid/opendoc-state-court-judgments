Negligence – Fallen Tree – Liability of MCST – Exemption clause in car park label, carpark notice

11 July 2019

### District Judge Lee Li Choon:

## Background

1       The Plaintiffs in both suits are residents at the Pandan Valley Condominium (‘condominium”). The Defendants are the Management Corporation of the condominium responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the common property of the condominium.

2       The Plaintiffs had parked their cars at the open carpark situated in front of Block 4 of the condominium on 28 December 2015. It rained during the night of 28 December 2015. The following morning, the Plaintiffs discovered that an Angsana Tree had fallen onto and damaged their cars.

## The Plaintiffs’ Case

3       The Plaintiffs’ suit against the Defendants relies on this premise - that the damage to the Plaintiffs’ cars was caused by the negligence of the Defendants and/or their employees, and/or workers, and/or servants and/or agents in their failure to, inter alia, provide proper assessment, planning, planting, monitoring, maintenance, inspection and upkeep of the tree that fell, thereby causing and/or permitting the tree to be diseased and/or in a state of decay which in turn caused the tree to fall and damage the Plaintiffs’ cars.

4       In summary, the particulars of negligence that were pleaded are as follows:

> (a)     Failing to maintain or properly maintain the tree

> (b)     Failing to ensure or failing to take any or any sufficient measures to ensure that the tree does not pose any danger that could be reasonably foreseeable or that the tree does not fall and cause damage to any property;

> (c)     Failing to adequately monitor, maintain and/or manage the tree or to properly assess tree risk, and failing to implement appropriate mitigating measures to prevent the said tree from falling

> (d)     Failing to carry out any or any proper or timely maintenance of the tree;

> (e)     Limiting the lateral growth of the tree thereby causing lack of support or instability of the said tree on the ground;

> (f)     Planting the tree and/or allowing the tree to remain in a location which constrained the space for the lateral spreading of the roots;

> (g)     Failing to engage competent and qualified arborists or risks assessors to evaluate the risks posed by the tree prior to it falling onto the vehicles;

> (h)     Failing to ensure adequate growing space for the said tree, thereby causing the tree to fall;

> (i)     Failing to exercise due safety and care in the course of handling, maintaining and/or management of the tree

> (j)     Failing to satisfy and/or perform the duties as a Management Corporation under section 29 of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act

5       The Plaintiffs also pleaded their reliance on res ipsa loquitur.

## The Defendants’ Defence

6       In their Defence, the Defendants deny liability and say that prior to its falling, the tree was observed to be healthy, in particular, the tree “_did not show any signs of decay or root rot and there was no water logging observed in the vicinity of the tree_”. The Defendants also averred that at all material times prior to the fall of the tree, the Defendants had in place a Landscape Maintenance Agreement with a landscaping contractor which covered the pruning of trees.

7       The Defendants also say that they are exempted from liability as the Plaintiffs were or ought to be aware that all vehicles parked in the carpark of the condominium were parked at the owner’s own risk and the Defendants would not be responsible for damage to the vehicles. The Defendants also rely on a notice they have placed at the entrance of the carpark as well as the terms and conditions set out in the parking label issued to the Plaintiffs by the Defendants in support of their position that they are exempted from liability.

## Accepted Facts

8       All parties in the two suits opted for a documents-only trial. Their counsel also represented to the court that this was a case that was appropriate for a documents-only trial.

9       The case proceeded based on the following accepted facts:

> (a)     The Defendants did not engage an arborist to conduct regular inspection of the trees in the condominium.

> (b)     The Defendants had in place only a Landscape Maintenance Agreement (“landscaping agreement”) with a landscaping contractor. The scope of work covered in this landscaping agreement included “grass cutting”, “plant watering”, “weeding”, “fertilizing”, “spraying of insecticide/fungicide”, “pruning of trees”, “cutting of dry leaves and fallen leaves collection” and “forking of soil” but did not include inspection of trees or tree assessments[^1].

> (c)     While the scope of work covered in the landscaping agreement included “pruning of trees” on a yearly basis, this only covered pruning of low trees that are below 3m that obstruct the view of pedestrians and motorists. For trees above 3m, the landscaping agreement provides that pruning is subject to a separate quote as and when required[^2].

> (d)     The Defendants had depended on the ad-hoc gratuitous advice from this landscaping contractor, residents’ feedback and their own representatives’ assessment pursuant to their own checks to determine when the “taller” trees in the condominium may require pruning[^3].

> (e)     The Defendants say that on average, they would call in the pruning contractor about 1 to 2 times in a year to prune the taller trees[^4].

## Findings of the Single Joint Expert

10     All parties rely on the evidence and the Tree Structural Failure Assessment Report (“the Report”) [^5] of the single joint expert, Mr Thomas Richard Gordon, certified arborist and Director of AborCulture Pte Ltd for the causes of the falling of the tree. The findings of Mr Thomas Richard Gordon in the Report are stated as follows[^6]:

> “_Probable causes of structural failure of the root plate (contributing factors):_

> _Restricted growing space, limiting the lateral spread of structural roots between carpark surface and fence strip foundation (observed on site and in clear view prior to tree failure)_

> _Decayed main root (observed on site yet most likely out of view prior to tree failure)_

> _Wind force; reported in vicinity of No.4 Pandan Valley on 28 December 2016 by Meteorological Services Singapore as: Northerly to north-easterly 5-35km/h gusting to 55km/hr_

> _Rain force and load; reported in vicinity of No. 4 Pandan Valley on 28 December 2016 by Meteorological Services Singapore as: Moderate to heavy showers 1700hr to 2310hr_

> _Softening of soils from heavy rain; contributor to unsupportive ground in which the tree roots inhabit._

> _Tree lean, although not confirmed tree was leaning prior to failure; It is believed lean or an asymmetry of tree crown produced an amount of gravitational force on the tree fall side.”[^7]_

11     The above summary of the contributing factors can also be found in the conclusion of the Report which is stated as follows:

> “_It is highly probable that the cause of tree failure by uprooting was a combination of environmental forces (wind and rain), the force of gravity and; an inadequacy of lateral main root spread due to growing space constraint._

> _While the environmental forces are not able to be controlled easily and gravity is constant, the site condition elements associated with root system growing space constraint should have been sufficient to warrant further investigation from which, the implementation of appropriate mitigating measures may have prevented the tree failure incident occurring.”_

## Issues Before This Court

12     I will proceed to outline the issues for my determination.

13     It is not in issue that the Defendants, as an agency responsible for the maintenance of the condominium, owe a duty of care to the residents of the condominium including the Plaintiffs. In determining whether the Defendants are liable for negligence, the court will have to make a finding on whether the Defendants have breached this duty of care. To answer this question, it must first be determined what standard of care is to be imposed on the Defendants as a matter of law. Thereafter, the facts and circumstances of the case will have to be examined to make a determination as to whether the Defendants have breached this standard of care and whether the breaches by the Defendants caused the damage to the Plaintiffs and that therefore, the Defendants should thereby be liable for the property damage caused to the Plaintiffs.

14     As the Defendants have also pleaded that they are exempted from liability arising from the car park notice and the terms and conditions in the car park label, if the above question of whether the Defendants have breached the duty of care owed to the Plaintiffs is answered in the affirmative, the next issue I have to determine is whether the Defendants are nonetheless, exempted from liability by virtue of the car park notice and the terms and conditions in the car park label.

## My Decision

15     As I have stated above, the existence of a duty of care owed by the Defendants to the Plaintiffs is not in dispute. The focus of the dispute between the parties is whether the Defendants had, in any respect, breached the standard of care expected of the Defendants as a management agency of the condominium and if those breaches of the standard of care expected of the Defendants brought about the Plaintiffs’ property damage. As the issues of breach of standard of care and that of causation are intertwined, I will give my analysis and my findings on these two issues as a whole.

16     Generally, the standard of care is the objective standard of a reasonable person using ordinary care and skill. It is trite law that “negligence is the omission to do something which a reasonable man, guided upon those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs, would do, or doing something which a prudent or reasonable man would not do.”[^8]

17     The standard of care may accommodate relevant circumstances in order to either modify the standard of care or render the standard more specific to the class of persons to which the Defendants belong[^9]. In this connection, the objective test for the standard of care means that the Defendants are to be judged by the standard of a reasonable person of the class of persons to which the Defendants belong, i.e., that of a reasonably competent property management agency.

18     In this regard, industry standards or practices is a relevant factor. The standard of care is also to be based on what was reasonably foreseeable as measured by the prevailing knowledge at the material time of the event, and not after. As cautioned by our Singapore courts[^10], the standard imposed should not be assessed based on the “benefit of hindsight”[^11], “ex post facto knowledge”[^12] or “retrospective plausiblity’[^13] after the tortious event. Thus, evidence of the Defendants’ knowledge of the likelihood of harm combined with evidence of a failure to follow the industry standards or practices as prevailing as at the time of the incident would be determinative as to whether the Defendants have breached their duty of care.

19     In this regard, I note that the Plaintiffs have not surfaced any evidence relating to the industry standard that is generally exercised by other property management agencies in relation to the maintenance of trees in the common property of condominium projects. As for the Defendants’ prevailing knowledge at the relevant point in time, the Defendants’ unchallenged case is that prior to its falling, the tree was observed to be healthy and showed no signs of decay or root rot and there was no water logging observed in the vicinity of the tree.

20     I will now examine the expert evidence as regards the causes for the falling of the Angsana tree. I note from the findings of the single joint expert in the Report that there is no one single cause identified as the predominant cause for the tree to fall. A reading of the Report shows that several contributing factors have been identified as the causes which led to the tree falling. In gist, I would group these contributing factors into the following categories: (a) environmental factors (wind force, rain force, softening of soils from heavy rain), (b) force of gravity caused by tree lean that in turn was due to the asymmetry of the tree crown (however, I note that it was stated by the single joint expert that it cannot be confirmed if the tree was leaning prior to the falling of the tree)[^14]; and (c) restricted growing space thus not allowing lateral spread of structural roots which then in turn brought about internal root structural failure.

21     Of the 3 categories, clearly, the Defendants cannot be faulted for environmental factors. Therefore, one could only pin the fault on the Defendants in respect of 2 categories – that of force of gravity caused by tree lean due to the asymmetry of the tree crown and that of restricted growing space for the lateral spread of structural roots causing internal root failure or structural instability of the tree. I will address the issue of standard of care and breach thereof based on each of these two categories of causes identified by the single joint expert in turn.

22     First, the asymmetry of the tree crown which caused the tree lean. This cause, if proven, gives rise to the issue of whether the Defendants have breached the standard of care imposed on them by law in failing to prune the tree as presumably, pruning of the tree could have avoided the problem of asymmetry of the tree crown which would then have avoided the problem of the tree lean.

23     On this cause, I note that the finding in the Report stated clearly that it could not be established that the tree was leaning prior to the falling of the tree. Therefore, if it could not be established that the tree was leaning prior to the falling of the tree, then it follows that it cannot be established that pruning of the tree crown would have avoided the falling of the tree. Be that as it may, I will examine the standard of care required of the Defendants as regards the pruning of the tree.

24     The Defendants say that they had depended on the ad-hoc gratuitous advice from the landscaping contractor, residents’ feedback and their own representatives’ own checks to perform pruning of trees in the common property of the condominium and that that on average, they would call in the pruning contractor about 1 to 2 times in a year to prune the taller trees in the common property of the condominium.

25     On the pruning of trees in the common property, the Plaintiffs have not surfaced any evidence as regards the standard of care reasonably to be expected of the Defendants such as, for example, evidence showing the standard observed by other reasonably competent property management agencies in relation to the maintenance of trees – including evidence showing the frequency of pruning, or the engagement of tree experts to perform regular tree checks by other property management agencies. There is therefore no evidence to show that the Defendants have fallen short of the industry standards or practice as regards the pruning of trees in the common property of the condominium.

26     As I have already stated above, the expert’s evidence is that it is not established that there was leaning of the tree crown prior to the falling of the tree. In any event, even if I were to find that the Defendants had breached their duty of care in that they had failed to prune the tree in question, and even if it is established that there was leaning of the tree crown prior to the falling of the tree, as there is no evidence that the gravitational force caused by the leaning of the tree due to the asymmetry of the tree crown was the main cause of the tree falling, there is still the causation issue to be overcome. In other words, even if it is established that there was leaning of the tree crown caused by the Defendants’ breach of the duty of care, this alone was not established to be the predominant cause of the falling of the tree and therefore, the failure to prune the tree by the Defendants, even if this is established, this failure alone did not result in the falling of the tree.

27     There is also no evidence to show that the Defendants ought to have known that the tree in question needed pruning and that it was reasonably foreseeable that the tree would fall due to failure of pruning.

28     I will now examine the facts and circumstances surrounding the other cause that has been identified by the expert – that of restricted growing space thus not allowing lateral spread of structural roots which then presumably caused a structural weakening of the tree and/or rotting of the roots.

29     In relation to this particular cause for the falling of the tree, the Defendants’ evidence that there was no visible tree rot or water logging near the vicinity of the tree and that therefore, there was nothing that could have alerted the Defendants to the possibility that the tree had internal structural root failure or tree rot, was unchallenged.

30     Counsel for the Defendants urged me to take a leaf from the Botanic Gardens tree failure case (information about this case was tendered through page 1-18 of the Defendants’ Bundle of Documents dated 6 June 2018). Counsel for the Defendants surfaced this case to illustrate the Defendants’ contention that the evidence in our case does not show that the Defendants had breached the standard of care that ought to have been exercised by the Defendants as at the relevant time.

31     I note that this case is not a case decided on the tort of negligence. This case went before the coroner for a coroner’s inquiry and the coroner’s ruling that the death in that case was due to “a tragic misadventure” was reported in our local news sources. The case involved the falling of a tree planted in our Botanic Gardens. Counsel for the Defendants pointed out that it was reported that “_no one, not even experts could have seen it coming that a Tembusu tree of the Singapore Botanic Gardens would topple and cause the death of a 38 year old woman (in February 2017)_” and that the coroner had ruled that the death of the woman was caused by “_a misadventure_”.

32     I note from the Straits Times report of 19 July 2017 (page 15-17 of the Defendants’ Bundle of Documents dated 6 June 2018) that _“(t)he 40m-tall Tembusu tree …. was decaying from the inside, but signs of the rot had not been visible to inspectors, making it hard to predict that it would topple_”. Similarly, in our case, there is no evidence whatsoever to show that there were visible signs that there was internal rot or internal root structural issues with the tree in question.

33     From the submissions made on behalf the Defendants, I will summarise the Defendants’ arguments as regards the relevant takeaways from this coroner’s case that are put forward for my consideration:

> (a)     Though the tree in the coroner’s case was checked twice a year, the internal decay was not detected. The incident in the coroner’s case happened on 17 February 2017 and the last inspection in that case was on 29 September 2016 (page 13 of the Defendants’ Bundle of Documents dated 6 June 2018). Counsel for the Defendants argued that this shows that internal decay could not have been detected through the standard of tree risk assessment adopted by our Singapore Botanic Gardens as at February 2017 – which is also the relevant point of time for the purposes of our case.

> (b)     The coroner found that the uprooting was due to a combination of factors including heavy rainfall, strong winds and root problems (page 12 of the Defendants’ Bundle of Documents dated 6 June 2018). The findings of the Coroner had been reported as such: "_The wind had initiated the process by buffeting the 40 m tall tree causing considerable swaying. The swaying transferred these strong imposed forces down the trunk and in turn caused the degraded tension roots to fracture_" (page 13 of the Defendants’ Bundle of Documents dated 6 June 2018).

34     I find the coroner’s case to be a relevant guide on 2 points. First, even if the Defendants were to be judged based on the standard of care that was practised by our Singapore Botanic Gardens at the time of the incident and had performed the relevant tree risk assessments on a regular basis, based on the same conclusion as drawn in the coroner’s case, the internal root problem would still not have been detected. Next, as the single joint expert in our case has testified that the falling of the tree in our case was also partly due to strong winds and softening of the soil due to the rain, the conclusion that I will make is also similar to that in the coroner’s case - that it was an unfortunate “misadventure”.

35     I note that the single joint expert in our case has stated that _“(i)n light of the fact that the trees were planted in the area of high vehicle occupancy, a prudent tree owner should engage a competent arborist or landscape company to regularly inspect and conduct tree risk assessment at least annually_”. I do not find this statement of opinion helpful as it does not answer the question as regards the standard of care to be imposed on the Defendants. The Plaintiffs have not put forward any evidence to show that getting a tree expert or engaging an arborist to perform tree inspection and tree risk assessment is the industry standard or is the standard practised by other property management agencies exercising reasonable care. There is therefore no basis to find that the Defendants should have engaged a competent arborist or should have engaged a landscape company to regularly inspect and conduct tree risk assessment at least annually and that by virtue of their failure to do so, the Defendants have breached their duty of care.

36     I will now briefly deal with the issue of causation. The test is the “but for” test, that is, it must be shown that the Plaintiffs would not have suffered the property damage if the Defendants had not been negligent. Generally, the burden is on the Plaintiffs to prove causation on a balance of probabilities. As I have found above, and as there are a number of contributing factors that caused the falling of the tree, I will conclude that in addition to the Plaintiffs’ failure to show that the Defendants have breached their duty of care, the Plaintiffs have also not shown that the tree would not have fallen but for the negligence of the Defendants in maintaining the tree.

37     The Plaintiffs have also pleaded that the principle of _res ipsa loquitur_ applies in this case. Generally, the _res ipsa loquitur_ principle is resorted to where there are difficulties faced by a plaintiff in adducing direct evidence of negligent conduct on the part of the defendant and as a result, the plaintiff seeks to rely on circumstantial or indirect evidence to prove his case.

38     As stated by the High Court in _Rathanamalah d/o Shunmugam v Chia Kok Hoong_[^15], the principle is a practical tool of evidence, allowing the ready inference of breach or negligence where direct evidence may not be ready at hand, and not a rule or doctrine of law. For the principle of _res ipsa loquitur_ to apply, three conditions must be satisfied:

> (a)     the occurrence is such that it would not have happened without negligence;

> (b)     the thing which inflicted the damage was under the sole management and control of the defendant; and

> (c)     there must be no evidence as to why or how the occurrence took place[^16].

39     Once the three conditions are satisfied, the plaintiff would establish a _prima facie_ case of negligence by the defendant. In the present case, the first condition is not satisfied, because, as I have earlier stated, various causes have been cited as probable causes for the falling of the tree, in particular, environmental conditions such as the rain and strong winds were cited as probable causes. Thus, the necessary causal nexus between the Defendants’ purported negligence and the property damage suffered by the Plaintiffs has not been shown. In addition, as for condition (c), in the present case, there was expert evidence that was adduced and the court is able to come to a conclusion on whether, on a balance of probabilities, the Plaintiffs have proven negligence based on the expert evidence.

40     Therefore, as the conditions are not satisfied, the principle of _res ipsa loquitur_ does not apply.

41     In a claim based on negligence, the legal burden of proof is on the Plaintiffs to show on a balance of probabilities that the Defendants have breached their duty of care. As the Plaintiffs have not established that the Defendants have breached their duty of care based on the standard of care imposed on them as a reasonably competent property management agency, I therefore conclude that the Defendants have not been shown to have breached their duty of care towards the Plaintiffs in failing to properly maintain the tree such as pruning the tree or in failing to conduct a tree inspection or tree risk management through a tree expert such as an arborist. It is also not established that the causes for the falling of the tree are due to the Defendants’ negligence in maintaining the tree.

42     In the circumstances, the Plaintiffs’ claims against the Defendants based on negligence therefore fail.

43     Having found that the Plaintiffs’ tortious claims against the Defendants fail, it is not necessary for me to examine the issue of whether the wording on the car park notice and the terms and conditions on the car park label have the effect of exempting the Defendants from liability nonetheless.

44     However, for completeness, I will briefly deal with this issue.

45     The issue here is whether the wording of the car park notice and the terms and conditions on the car park label is effective to exclude the Defendants’ liability. The contention of the Defendants goes like this: The Defendants allowed the Plaintiffs to park their cars in that particular carpark and in turn, the Plaintiffs agreed to grant the Defendant an exclusion of liability.

46     The Defendants rely on various cases for the trite legal principles in this area; notably, the Court of Appeal case of _Marina Centre Holdings Pte Ltd v Pars Carpet Gallery Ptd Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] SGCA 40</span>. They contend that the law is clear: if the wording of the exclusion is clear, give effect to it and that in this regard, it is not crucial for the word "_negligence_" to appear in the clause.

47     An examination of the wording on the car park notice[^17] shows that the wording is clear. The words “_howsoever caused_”, “_no responsibility_” and "_parked entirely at the owner’s risk"_ are all amply clear.

48     The case _Sim Jwee Kiat v City Car Rentals & Tours Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1990\] SGCA 13</span> has also clearly established the following for us: That it is not necessary or mandatory for the word "_negligence_" to appear in an exclusion clause for the clause to be effective to exclude negligence. If the circumstances are clear that liability rests on negligence and nothing else, the clause must be construed to cover negligence[^18]. In the present case, the Defendants can only be liable to the Plaintiffs if they had been negligent. Hence, it is clear that negligence is covered by the car park notice.

49     In the circumstances, the clear wording in car park notice which also covers exemption from liability arising from negligence is effective to exclude the Defendants from liability.

50     Similarly, the car park labels issued to the Plaintiffs contain wordings such as "_entirely at owner’s risk_ "; "_shall not be held liable_"; "_for any damage caused to vehicles_". In offering to allow the Plaintiffs to park their vehicles at the car park, the Defendants have issued the terms and conditions contained in the car park labels and the Plaintiffs are taken to have accepted the offer based on those terms and conditions by parking their cars there. The acceptance by the Plaintiffs of those terms and conditions with clear meaning means that the Plaintiffs have agreed to exclude the Defendants from any liability arising from the Defendants’ negligence.

## Conclusion

51     In the circumstances, the Plaintiffs’ claims against the Defendants are dismissed with costs to the Defendants to be taxed, if not agreed.

#### Addendum

52     On 11 July 2019 when counsel for the parties appeared before the court to receive the grounds of decision, they requested for the court to fix costs. Accordingly, I awarded fixed costs of $7000 plus reasonable disbursements plus GST to be paid by each of the two Plaintiffs to the Defendants.
