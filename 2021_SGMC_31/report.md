Courts and Jurisdiction – Magistrate’s court

Commercial Transactions – Sale of goods – Factors Act (Cap 386)

Civil procedure – Declaratory judgment

21 May 2021 - Judgment reserved

### District Judge Tan May Tee:

## Introduction

1       This action involves competing claims between victims of a fraudulent car dealer. The fraudulent car dealer in this case is the first defendant. The victims are the plaintiff on one part and the second and third defendants (“Defendants”) on the other. Unfortunately, the law can grant redress to only one party. Having considered the pleadings, the evidence adduced and the submissions, it is this court’s decision that the plaintiff’s claim for a declaration ought to prevail, with the consequence that the counterclaim of the Defendants will be dismissed.

2       The reasons for the court’s decision are set out herein.

## Background

3       The plaintiff, a retired security guard, and his family members had visited the first defendant’s showroom on 20 May 2018 with the intention of trading in his old vehicle, a Honda Airwave, for another similar used vehicle. They were attended to by a Mr Louis Tan, the first defendant’s representative.

4       The plaintiff decided on a Toyota Wish, bearing registration number SLL 4644K (“the Car”). The agreed price was $42,424 which was inclusive of a “new 5 years’ COE” as stated in the first defendant’s Sales Agreement[^1] signed by the plaintiff and Mr Louis Tan. The Certificate of Entitlement (“COE”) for the Car was due to expire on 17 June 2018.

5       The plaintiff made all the required payments to the first defendant under the Sales Agreement and took possession of the Car on 29 May 2018.

6       On the Defendants’ side, what had taken place was this – the first defendant had obtained floor stock financing in the sum of $9,300[^2] for the Car from the third defendant on or around 7 May 2018[^3]. In exchange, the Car had been transferred to and registered in the third defendant’s name[^4] pursuant to the terms of the Floor Stock Agreement. On 13 June 2018, the third defendant had paid to the Land Transport Authority (“LTA”) the sum of $18,953 to renew the COE for the Car for a further five years up to 16 June 2023[^5]. The third defendant had transferred the Car to the second defendant, its related company, on 2 November 2018[^6].

7       On or around 7 June 2019, the plaintiff was shocked to receive a letter[^7] from the first defendant’s solicitors notifying him of a dispute with the finance company on the transfer of ownership of the Car. The plaintiff engaged solicitors who issued the writ in the present action on 5 November 2019 against all three defendants. As the first defendant had failed to enter an appearance, the plaintiff obtained interlocutory judgment in default for damages to be assessed on 27 November 2019.

8       On 25 May 2020, the second defendant, as the registered owner of the Car, repossessed the Car on the basis of the first defendant’s breach of the Floor Stock Agreement[^8]. The second and third defendants had proposed to transfer the Car to the plaintiff subject to the plaintiff placing the amount of $28,253 (being the full amount they had expended for the Car) to be held in escrow by solicitors pending the resolution of the suit but this was rejected by the plaintiff.

## Plaintiff’s pleaded claim and reliefs sought

9       The matters relevant to the claim against the second and third defendants appear to be set out in paragraphs 12 to 18 of the statement of claim. In essence, the plaintiff avers that:

> (a)     Pursuant to the floor stock financing agreement between the defendants, the first defendant was a “buyer in possession”.

> (b)     Alternatively, the first defendant was in substance a mercantile agent who was given possession of the Car for purposes of sale.

> (c)     The plaintiff was a buyer in good faith without notice of the rights and/or ownership of the Car by the second or third defendants.

> (d)     The plaintiff had purchased the Car honestly from the first defendant. At the point of purchase, the first defendant had held itself out to be the owner of the Car and had never raised the fact that the second or third defendants were the true owners.

> (e)     Applying s 2 and /or s 9 of the Factors Act (Cap 386), the plaintiff claims to be the beneficial owner of the Car.

> (f)     The second and third defendants continue to hold ownership of the Car and have failed, refused and/or neglected to effect transfer of ownership of the Car to the plaintiff.

10     Accordingly, the plaintiff claims jointly and severally against the defendants:

> (a)     a declaration that he is the legal owner of the Car and a transfer of ownership,

> (b)     damages,

> (c)     costs, and

> (d)     such further or other relief as the court deems fit.

## 2nd and 3rd Defendants’ defence and counterclaim

11     In their defence, the Defendants pleaded that at all material times, the third defendant was the legal and beneficial owner of the Car. The first defendant had no authority to sell the Car to the plaintiff without the consent of the third defendant. In any case, the third defendant was not aware that the Car had been sold to the plaintiff as the first defendant had not obtained the third defendant’s consent before entering into the Sales Agreement with the plaintiff.

12     The Defendants rely on the terms of the Floor Stock Agreement signed by the first defendant which provided _inter alia_ that:

> (a)     The first defendant acknowledged and agreed that the third defendant is the legal and beneficial owner of the Car, and that the Car was to be transferred to and registered to the third defendant.

> (b)     The first defendant acknowledged and agreed that they were not the agent of the third defendant, and had no authority to bind the third defendant to any contract.

> (c)     The first defendant expressly and irrevocably undertook to obtain the third defendant’s written consent before entering into or agreeing to enter into any sale, transfer, removal and disposal of the Car.

> (d)     The first defendant was only allowed to retain physical possession of the Car for the sole purpose of display at its premises.

13     The Defendants assert that the plaintiff is precluded from claiming that he was a buyer in good faith with no notice of their rights and/or ownership of the Car by virtue of the following:

> (a)     The plaintiff was informed by the first defendant’s representative that ownership of the Car would be transferred to him when he paid the deposit on or around 20 May 2018, and he had made payment of $25 to effect the transfer. Despite the transfer of the Car not having been effected, the plaintiff had proceeded to trade in his previous vehicle and make full payment to the first defendant.

> (b)     The plaintiff only realised that the first defendant was not the legal owner of the Car on 7 June 2019, more than a year after his purported purchase of the Car.

> (c)     The plaintiff ought to have known that pursuant to Rule 25(1) of the Road Traffic (Motor Vehicles, Registration and Licensing) Rules (the “RTR”), it was mandatory for either the first defendant or the plaintiff to make an application for the registration of the Car to be transferred within seven days of the transfer of possession, failing which they would each have been guilty of an offence pursuant to Rule 25(3) of the RTR.

> (d)     A reasonable person should have expected that the registration of the Car be transferred to him within seven days, failing which the plaintiff should have made the application for the transfer of the registration of the Car by himself. This was particularly so since the plaintiff is not an inexperienced car owner, having owned his previous vehicle for a number of years.

> (e)     At any point before the purchase of the Car, the plaintiff could have performed a free online check on Land Transport Authority’s (“LTA”) registry which was available to the public at large to ensure that the registration of the Car belonged to the first defendant prior to paying the first defendant and taking possession of the Car. The plaintiff had, however, wilfully shut his eyes to the means of knowledge available to him.

14     The Defendants maintain that the plaintiff should not be entitled to any equitable remedies as he had been wilfully blind to the circumstances, and had not come to court with clean hands as he had:

> (a)     failed to check the ownership of the Car before purchase,

> (b)     failed to ensure the transfer of registration of the Car to him before payment,

> (c)     failed to follow up with Louis Tan to ensure the transfer of the Car was completed, and

> (d)     failed to make his own application to LTA to transfer the Car in breach of the RTR.

15     The Defendants have also pleaded that it was the third defendant who had paid for the renewal of the COE for the Car on 13 June 2018 after the plaintiff had entered into the Sales Agreement with the first defendant. As the Car had been repossessed on 25 May 2020, the plaintiff was thereby liable to the Defendants in conversion for the Car as well as the COE. Alternatively, the plaintiff had been unjustly enriched at the expense of the third defendant and the third defendant is entitled to restitution of the sum of $18,953 paid for the COE as well as $1,076 paid for the road tax for the Car.

16     Accordingly, the Defendants counter-claimed damages for conversion of the Car and the COE. Alternatively, the Defendants claimed equitable compensation in respect of all the sums that they had paid for the Car.

## Issues

17     The Defendants raised several preliminary issues as follows:

> (a)     whether the plaintiff’s statement of claim had pleaded a valid cause of action;

> (b)     whether the Magistrate’s Court has the jurisdiction to try this action and grant the declaratory relief sought given the inconsistencies in the claims made in the plaintiff’s affidavits of evidence-in-chief (“AEICs”) and his statement of claim; and

> (c)     whether the default judgment entered against the first defendant precluded the plaintiff from maintaining this action against the Defendants.

18     The substantive issues before the court centred on the application of s 2 and s 9 of the Factors Act (Cap 386) to the factual matrix of this case given that the main plank of the plaintiff’s case is that he had obtained good title to the Car pursuant to these provisions[^9]. In this regard, the issues that the court has to decide on are:

> (a)     whether the first defendant is to be regarded as the mercantile agent in possession of the Car with the consent of the third defendant at the material time within the meaning of s 2(1) of the Factors Act;

> (b)     whether the first defendant had sold the Car to the plaintiff in the ordinary course of business of a mercantile agent; and

> (c)     whether the plaintiff was a purchaser of the Car in good faith without notice that the first defendant had no authority to sell the Car to him, and without notice of the rights of the Defendants in respect of the Car.

## Preliminary issues

19     It was pointed out by the Defendants’ counsel that the statement of claim contained matters which are clearly not material facts in the present case:

> (a)     Paragraph 17 of the statement of claim appeared to be an extract lifted directly from the judgment of my learned brother, District Judge Loo Ngan Chor, in _Kau Joo Guan v Kwek Seow Hui t/a Car Dynasty and One Motor Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 279</span> (“_Kau Joo Guan_”).

> (b)     Paragraph 15 of the statement of claim appeared to be a submission. It stated:

>> “… given the current practice current practice of electronic LTA records, English log book cases should be distinguished. Furthermore, section 2 and/or section 9 of the Factors Act (Cap 386, Rev Ed 1994) should be applicable in this case.”

20     While the plaintiff is relying heavily on the ruling in _Kau Joo Guan_ premised on a similar factual matrix, I agree that paragraphs 15 and 17 of his statement of claim offend the rules of pleadings stated in O 18 r 7(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”) and should not have been included. The Defendants had not applied to strike them out earlier but they are at liberty to make submissions to the court and seek the appropriate orders should they have been prejudiced in any manner.

### Whether the Magistrate’s Court has the jurisdiction to hear this action

21     The Defendants submitted that the plaintiff in his AEIC[^10] as well as during his oral testimony was now seeking an order for delivery up of the Car. This was contrary to the prayers in the statement of claim which were for a declaration and damages. As the court is precluded from granting the plaintiff a relief that has not been claimed in the statement of claim (see _Edmund Tie & Co (SEA) Pte Ltd v Savills Residential Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 349</span>), even if the case were to succeed on the merits, the plaintiff cannot be granted the order for delivery up of the Car being a relief he had not prayed for.

22     Furthermore, the Defendants argued that if the plaintiff’s claim was solely for delivery up of the Car (as he had testified to in court), the Magistrate’s Court has no jurisdiction to hear and try this action since there is no claim involving any sum of money. The plaintiff had confirmed on the witness stand that he is not claiming damages[^11]. He had also not provided any evidence as to quantum of damages in his AEIC, and had not sought an order for the trial to be bifurcated.

#### Magistrate’s Court has jurisdiction to hear and try this action

23     The Defendants’ argument was predicated on s 52(1A) of the State Courts Act (Cap 321) which provides that:

> (1A)  The jurisdiction of a Magistrate’s Court under subsection (1) shall not include jurisdiction to hear and try any action where —

>> (a)    there is no claim for any sum of money

24     In my view, the issue of whether the Magistrate’s Court is seised of jurisdiction has to be considered on the basis of the claims pleaded in the statement of claim. Whether or not the plaintiff succeeds on the claims pleaded would be a matter of evidence led in the proceedings. As the plaintiff had made a claim for damages in his statement of claim, I would regard this as a claim for a sum of money which would entitle the Magistrate’s Court to make “binding declarations of rights” pursuant to s 52 (1B)(b)(ii) of the State Courts Act.

#### Magistrate’s Court can grant declaratory judgment without a cause of action

25     As alluded to at \[10\] above, the plaintiff is seeking a declaration that he is the legal owner of the Car and a transfer of ownership, as well as damages. However, the plaintiff had not pleaded conversion of the Car in his statement of claim as his cause of action although he had in his closing submissions claimed that the Defendants were liable to him in damages for conversion[^12]. In fact, as the Car was in his possession when he commenced this action on 5 November 2019, he could not rely on conversion as his cause of action. The Car was repossessed in May 2020, some six months after the issue of the writ. No other cause of action has been pleaded in the statement of claim.

26     Upon the court’s request for clarifications of the parties’ submissions, the plaintiff argued that pursuant to O 15 r 16 of the ROC, the court could grant the declaration sought despite there being no cause of action pleaded in the statement of claim[^13]. The plaintiff’s position was based on the authority of _Karaha Bodas Co LLC v Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd_ \[2016\] 1 SLR(R) 112 (“_Karaha Bodas_”) where the Court of Appeal had observed at \[13\] that:

>     It is a fundamental rule that in every case where a plaintiff claims relief against a defendant, his claim must be founded on a reasonable cause of action. Otherwise, the claim is liable to be struck out. The only exception to this rule is when the plaintiff does not ask for substantive relief against the defendant, in the form, for example, of an order for damages, but instead only asks for a declaration of right. That is the situation encompassed by O 15 r16 which states:

>> No action or other proceeding shall be open to objection on the ground that a merely declaratory judgment or order is sought thereby, and the Court may make binding declarations of right whether or not any consequential relief is or could be claimed.

>     This rule sets out the exception to the general principle. Order15 r16 does not in itself mean that a plaintiff who is asking the court to make a declaration of right must thereby be held to have a good cause of action. To hold so would be contrary to well-established law on what constitutes a cause of action. By 1978, it was clear that the controversy over whether a party applying for declaratory relief must also have a subsisting cause of action or a right to some other substantive relief as well was over, since it had been clearly established before then that he need not. See Lord Diplock in _Gouriet v Union of Post Office Workers_ \[1978\] AC435 at 501 (“_Gouriet_”). In fact, as Lord Diplock observed, relief in the form of a declaration of right would generally be superfluous for a plaintiff who had a subsisting cause of action.

27     The Defendants countered that a plaintiff is only entitled to assert a claim under O 15 r 16 of the ROC if there is no claim for damages. Furthermore, on their reading of _Karaha Bodas_, the court must first be empowered with the jurisdiction to award the remedy sought. Since, as they had previously argued that the Magistrate’s Court under s 52 (1A) of the State Courts Act does not have jurisdiction to hear matters where there is no claim for damages, the conclusion that must be drawn is that the Magistrate’s Court has no jurisdiction to hear the plaintiff’s claim for a declaration pursuant to O 15 r 16[^14].

28     With respect, I am unable to agree with the Defendants’ submission. I am of the view that the requirements which must be met in order to seek declaratory relief laid down by the Court of Appeal in _Karaha Bodas_ at \[14\] have all been satisfied by the plaintiff in this case. The requirements are as follows:

> (a)     the court must have the jurisdiction and power to award the remedy;

> (b)     the matter must be justiciable in the court;

> (c)     as a declaration is a discretionary remedy, it must be justified by the circumstances of the case;

> (d)     the plaintiff must have _locus standi_ to bring the suit and there must be a real controversy for the court to resolve;

> (e)     any person whose interests might be affected by the declaration should be before the court; and

> (f)     there must be some ambiguity or uncertainty about the issue in respect of which the declaration is asked for so that the court’s determination would have the effect of laying such doubts to rest.

29     As for requirement (a), I had found at \[25\] that the Magistrate’s Court has the jurisdiction to deal with the plaintiff’s claim on the basis of his pleaded claim for damages regardless of the lack of evidence. With such jurisdiction, the Magistrate’s Court would have the power under s 52(1B)(b)(ii) of the State Courts Act to grant binding declarations.

30     The matter of the conflicting claims between the plaintiff and the Defendants is clearly justiciable; and the circumstances of the case justified the action being brought before the court thus satisfying requirements (b) and (c). There is also no difficulty with meeting requirements (d) to (f) on the facts of this case. On (d) and (e), it cannot be denied that the plaintiff as one of the victims of the first defendant’s fraud has the _locus standi_ to bring this suit, and he had included all parties whose interests would be affected. As for (f), the issue of title and ownership of the Car is one for which the court’s determination is required to put all doubts to rest.

31     In terms of procedure, while the applicant for a declaration in _Karaha Bodas_ had filed an originating summons, I do not think that the mode of commencement of the plaintiff’s action by way of a writ would preclude the court from granting a declaration. See _Singapore Civil Procedure_ 2020, vol 1 (Hon Justice Chua Lee Ming ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 10th ed, 2020) at para 15/16/2).

32     Accordingly, there is no impediment to the plaintiff’s action for a declaration despite there being no cause of action pleaded as against the Defendants.

### Whether the default judgment against first defendant precludes the plaintiff from maintaining this action against the Defendants

33     The Defendants argued that the plaintiff’s claim against the first defendant was for declaratory relief pursuant to the Sales Agreement. The claim for declaratory relief against the Defendants was on the basis that they were bound by the Sales Agreement by virtue of the first defendant being a mercantile agent. By entering interlocutory judgment against the first defendant for damages to be assessed, the Defendants submitted that the plaintiff had made an election to repudiate the Sales Agreement and claim against the first defendant for damages as a principal under the Sales Agreement. The plaintiff cannot concurrently claim against the Defendants for declaratory relief, transfer of title and damages[^15].

34     Having thus elected to claim against the first defendant as a principal, the Defendants contend that the plaintiff is precluded from taking an inconsistent alternative position by asserting that the terms of the Sales Agreement had granted him ownership of the Car as against the Defendants, and claim against them as the principal in the Sales Agreement.

35     I have to respectfully disagree with the Defendants’ analysis. The plaintiff’s pleaded claim against the first defendant was for breach of the Sales Agreement in failing to effect the transfer of ownership of the Car to him. The plaintiff’s cause of action against the first defendant was in breach of contract. While the plaintiff had prayed for a declaration jointly and severally against all the three defendants, the default interlocutory judgment entered against the first defendant was for damages only.

36     The plaintiff’s separate claim against the second and third defendants for declaration of ownership of the Car is pursuant to specific rights granted to the plaintiff under the relevant provisions of the Factors Act arising from the conduct of the parties in the sale transaction where the first defendant is regarded as a mercantile agent. The claim in contract against the first defendant was not inconsistent with the declaratory relief sought against the Defendants. The default judgment entered against the first defendant for damages did not bar the plaintiff from maintaining a separate and distinct claim against the other defendants for a declaration of his legal rights accorded to him by statute. This was not a typical principal-agent scenario where judgment obtained against the agent would preclude recovery against the principal for the same subject matter, as explained by the Court of Appeal in _United Bank Ltd v Banque Nationale de Paris and another_ <span class="citation">\[1989\] 2 SLR(R) 162</span>.

## Substantive issues

37     The substantive issues for determination pertain to the applicability of s 2 and s 9 of the Factors Act. For convenience, they are set out below:

>      **Powers of mercantile agent with respect to disposition of goods**

> **2.**—(1)    Where a mercantile agent is, with the consent of the owner, in possession of goods or of the documents of title to goods, any sale, pledge, or other disposition of the goods, made by him when acting in the ordinary course of business of a mercantile agent, shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be as valid as if he were expressly authorised by the owner of the goods to make the same:

>> Provided that the person taking under the disposition acts in good faith, and has not at the time of the disposition notice that the person making the disposition has no authority to make the same.

>      **Disposition by buyer obtaining possession**

> 9.    Where a person, having bought or agreed to buy goods, obtains with the consent of the seller possession of the goods or the documents of title to the goods, the delivery or transfer, by that person or by a mercantile agent acting for him, of the goods or documents of title under any sale, pledge, or other disposition thereof, or under any agreement for sale, pledge, or other disposition thereof, to any person receiving the same in good faith and without notice of any lien or other right of the original seller in respect of the goods, shall have the same effect as if the person making the delivery or transfer were a mercantile agent in possession of the goods or documents of title with the consent of the owner.

### Whether the first defendant was a mercantile agent in possession of the Car with the consent of the third defendant

38     A “mercantile agent” in the Factors Act is defined in s 1(1) of the Act as:

>     “a mercantile agent having in the customary course of his business as such agent authority either to sell goods or to consign goods for the purpose of sale, or to buy goods, or to raise money on the security of goods.”

Section 1(2) of the Act states that:

> “(a)  person shall be deemed to be in possession of goods … where the goods or documents are in the actual custody or are held by any other person subject to his control or for him or on his behalf.”

39     The evidence given by the Defendants’ credit controller, Ang Beng Hong (“DW1”), pointed to a business relationship between the first defendant and the third defendant which had been ongoing for some time. They had provided floor stock financing to the first defendant whose business model was on “COE cars”, _ie_ used cars that were nearing the expiry of their ten year COE and would need the COEs to be revalidated for the cars to continue running. According to DW1, they had been financing five to eight cars per month for the first defendant’s business[^16]. DW1 had also accepted that as financiers, they relied on car dealers like the first defendant to display their cars for sale[^17].

40     The Defendants had left the Car with the first defendant and had not checked on its whereabouts for over a year as they trusted the first defendant to honour the terms of the Floor Stock Agreement. The Defendants had also allowed the Car to be affixed with the first defendant’s name on its licence plates which remained there up to the date of repossession by the second defendant[^18].

41     Based on the evidence of DW1, I have to find that the first defendant was in fact a mercantile agent in possession of the Car with the consent of the third defendant as defined in the s 1(1) and s 1(2) of the Factors Act.

### Whether the first defendant as mercantile agent had sold the Car to the plaintiff in the ordinary course of business

42     It is also clear from the evidence that the first defendant had sold the Car to the plaintiff in the ordinary course of business. This had been admitted by DW1 when cross-examined. See excerpt below[^19]:

> Q    The vehicle was passed from the Defendants to Ken Garage for Ken Garage to sell the car. Yes or no?

> A    The vehicle was passed by the Defendant to Ken Garage for Ken Garage to sell that vehicle. Well, there’s a 2 steps in 1 question. Yes. In a---broadly.

43     Even without the express admission by DW1, the court would have found that the first defendant had sold the Car in the ordinary course of business. It is not disputed that the first defendant was in the business of selling used cars and according to DW1, specialised in selling cars with revalidated COEs. The Car was at all material times on display in the first defendant’s premises for the purposes of sale[^20].

44     Hence, regardless of the express terms of the Floor Stock Agreement of the third defendant, the inescapable conclusion is that the Car had been sold by the first defendant as mercantile agent within the meaning of s 2(1) of the Factors Act.

### Whether the plaintiff was a purchaser of the Car in good faith without notice of the rights of the Defendants

45     The proviso in s 2(1) of the Factors Act would apply to deny the plaintiff’s claim if it is shown that he had not acted in good faith, and had notice that the first defendant had no authority to sell the Car.

46     The Defendants sought to show the plaintiff’s lack of good faith by arguing that the plaintiff had chosen to be wilfully blind in not ensuring that the registration of the Car was transferred to his name before making full payment, not making the necessary inquiries with LTA, and not applying to LTA for the transfer of the Car to be registered in his name in breach of the RTR.

47     Coincidentally, arguments of a similar nature had been canvassed in the two District Court cases relied on by the plaintiff and had all been dismissed. In _Seah Lee Pheng Celeste v Lu Guan & Anor Privilege Capital Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 279</span> (“_Seah Lee Pheng Celeste”_) which decision had been affirmed by the High Court on appeal in HC/DCA 37/219, the learned district judge had accepted that the test for a lack of good faith requires proof of actual dishonesty or fraud. The court had also observed that mere negligence is not good enough, even if negligence is established. Where it is alleged that the buyer was negligent, the facts and circumstances must be such that the buyer was, or should have been, suspicious that something was wrong but deliberately refrained from making inquiries.

48     While, on hindsight, the plaintiff could certainly have exercised more vigilance, his actions were not in any way dishonest. Similar to the sentiments expressed by DJ Loo in _Kau Joo Guan_, I find in the present case that the purported failures by the plaintiff singly or combined do not suggest a lack of good faith or the turning of a blind eye on his part. It is also pertinent to consider s 61(2) of the Sale of Goods Act (Cap 393) which provides further elucidation on good faith as follows:

>     A thing is deemed to be done in good faith within the meaning of this Act when it is in fact done honestly, whether it is done negligently or not.

49     There was also nothing from the circumstances of the sale transaction that ought to have raised any red flags or lead the plaintiff to suspect that the first defendant had no authority to sell the Car to him. Given that his son had earlier made a purchase from the first defendant without any issues[^21], and the first defendant’s name was in fact embossed on the Car’s number plate[^22], there was nothing whatsoever that could have raised any suspicion on the part of the plaintiff that the first defendant had no right to sell him the Car.

50     Just as in _Kau Joo Guan_, I find that the plaintiff’s dealings with the first defendant were nothing more or less than that of an honest buyer of a used car. The plaintiff was a bona fide purchaser of the Car in good faith without notice of the rights of the Defendants at the material time.

## Other matters raised by the Defendants

51     The Defendants had sought to rely on my earlier decision in _Chiam Hui Tian Cindy_ v _Kenso Leasing Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGDC 80</span> which had applied the _nemo dat_ principle to deny the innocent car buyer’s claim. I should state for the record that the provisions in the Factors Act as well as s 25 of the Sale of Goods Act had not been cited to me in that case and were not considered. Having read the judgments of my learned brethren in both _Kau Joo Guan_ and _Seah Lee Pheng Celeste_, I would unreservedly agree with their analyses on the applicability of these provisions which serve to ameliorate the harshness of the _nemo dat_ rule in favour of the innocent purchaser as against the finance company with the legal title.

52     The Defendants had in their counterclaim sought by way of damages or equitable compensation, the sum of $18,953 paid for the renewal of COE. It was submitted that the five-year COE which the third defendant had purchased is a separate and distinct chattel from the Car that was capable of conversion by the plaintiff.

53     I would have to respectfully disagree with the Defendants. The amount paid by the third defendant was not for a new COE but for the extension of the existing COE of the Car with the number 2008060107001380W[^23]. It was clearly contemplated by the parties that the price paid by the plaintiff for the Car would include the sum for COE renewal as expressly stated in the Sales Agreement. According to the plaintiff, he had understood that when he signed the Sales Agreement, the COE had already been procured.[^24] As DW1 himself had testified, the first defendant’s “business operandi” focused on revalidated COE cars which business was being financed by the third defendant. The Car together with its COE was a single chattel that had been put up by the first defendant for sale in its ordinary course of business. DW1 had also conceded that the price paid by the plaintiff for the Car had factored in the renewed COE[^25].

54     While the Defendants have mounted a robust defence to the plaintiff’s claim based on their legal title to the Car, the factual matrix of the plaintiff’s case is no different from that of the innocent car buyers in _Kau Joo Guan_ and _Seah Lee Pheng Celeste._ The plaintiff is entitled to have legal recourse pursuant to s 2 (1) and/or s 9 of the Factors Act. It will be up to the Defendants to enforce their rights under the Floor Stock Agreement against the first defendant and adjust their business operations as needed per the pithy observation of my learned brother, DJ Loo, in _Kau Joo Guan_ at \[22\].

## Conclusion

55     The plaintiff succeeds in his claim for a declaration against the second and third defendants that he is the legal owner of the Car as prayed for in paragraph 19.1 of the statement of claim. Consequently, he is entitled to have the Car registered in his name. There will be no order for damages.

56     The counterclaim of the second and third defendants is dismissed.

57     The court will hear parties on the issue of costs if they are unable to agree on the same.
