### District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt:

## Introduction

The accused, a 33 year-old Singaporean male, had 28 charges preferred against him. He pleaded guilty to a basket of 9 charges which included drugs, property and driving-related offences. The remaining 19 charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. He was sentenced to a total sentence of 6 years and 11 months’ imprisonment (one month short of 7 years’ imprisonment) with caning and a period of driving disqualification. He appealed against his sentence and is now serving his imprisonment sentence.

6       I ordered the imprisonment sentences for 5 charges (emphasised above in bold) to run consecutively. These comprise the LT1 charge, the FRUT charge, the driving under disqualification charge, the forgery charge and one cheating charge. The imprisonment sentences for the remaining proceeded charges were ordered to run concurrently.

7       The total sentence added up to 5 years' and 23 months' imprisonment (i.e. 6 years and 11 months) and 3 strokes of the cane plus a period of disqualification from driving or holding all classes of licences. The imprisonment sentence was ordered to take effect from the date he was first remanded, discounting a very short period (i.e. 21 May 2019 to 1 June 2019) when he was serving sentence for another matter.

## Statement of Facts

8       I set out the statement of facts (“SOF”) which the accused admitted without qualification. The SOF (edited for the sake of brevity) reads as follows:

> **ACCUSED**

> The accused is Lim Zhi Wei Justur… He was unemployed at the time of the offences.

> **FACTS RELATING TO \[LT1\] CHARGE**

> 2.    On 5th December 2018, officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) … arrested the accused therein for suspicion of having consumed controlled drugs and recovered one (01) packet of crystalline substance … “C3”.

> 3    …the accused provided two bottles of his urine samples which were sealed …and sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) on 6th December 2018 for analysis.

> 4    On 10th December 2018, \[HSA analyst\] Ng Xue Qin …issued the Certificate under Section 16 of the Misuse of Drugs Act…stating that upon analysis, the said urine sample was found to contain Methamphetamine.

> 5    On 7th December 2018, \[HSA analyst\] Kwok Yi Ling Miiko…issued the Certificate under Section 16 of the Misuse of Drugs Act…stating that upon analysis, the said urine sample was found to contain Methamphetamine.

> 6    Methamphetamine is a Specified Drug listed in The Fourth Schedule to The Misuse of Drugs Act… The accused is not authorized to consume Methamphetamine …and he has thereby committed an offence under Section 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185.

> 7    Prior to the commission of this offence, the accused had, on 31st May 2011…been convicted of an offence of Consumption of Specified Drug, to wit, Methamphetamine, under Section 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), and was sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment.

> 8    The accused had also, on 10th April 2013…been convicted of an offence of Consumption of Specified Drug, to wit, Methamphetamine, under Section 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), and was sentenced to 3 years’ imprisonment, which convictions have not been set aside. As such, the accused is now liable to be punished under Section 33A(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185 (2008 Rev Ed).

> **FACTS RELATING TO \[Driving Under Disqualification And Without Insurance Coverage\] CHARGES**

> 9    The complainant is … the owner of motorcar SJW9243S…

> 10    …

> 11    On 7th March 2019 at or about 10 pm, along Block 80 Lorong 4 Toa Payoh, Singapore, the accused drove the motorcar, SJW9243S which was rented under his name from the complainant whilst under disqualification…

> 12    …the complainant cross-checked the accused’s driving licence via the police website, and she discovered that the accused’s driving licence was invalid. The complainant quickly contacted the accused, and asked him to return the said motorcar. The complainant also lodged a police report the next day. The accused had been disqualified by the State Courts of Singapore from holding or obtaining a driving licence for all classes of vehicles for a period of 12 months with effect from 6 December 2018 till 5 December 2019.

> 13    As the accused was driving the said motorcar whilst under disqualification, there was no such a policy of insurance or security in respect of the Third-Party Risks as complies with the requirements of the Motor Vehicle (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act, Chapter 189.

> 14    Even though the accused had been disqualified…the accused failed to deliver his driving licence to the licensing section, traffic command within 7 days of the order of disqualification in contravention of section 44(3) of the Road Traffic Act Chapter 276.

> 15    The accused has therefore committed the offences of:

>> a)    Driving a vehicle whilst under disqualification under Section 43(4) of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276;

>> b)    Using vehicle without insurance coverage under Section 3(1) of the Motor Vehicle Act, Chapter 189.

> **FACTS RELATING TO \[FRUT\] CHARGE**

> 16    On 12th August 2017, the accused was placed under supervision for 24 months by virtue of Regulation 15(2) of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (Reg 3, 1999 Rev Ed).

> 17    … the accused was required to present himself for urine test at Ang Mo Kio Police Division Headquarters on every Monday and Thursday of each month, commencing on 14th August 2017…to 11th August 2019 (“Order”).

> 18    …he failed to present himself for his urine test on 4th April 2019 (Thursday)…and he has thereby committed an offence punishable under Regulation 15(3)(f) read with Regulation 15(6)(a) of the Regulations. The accused had failed to present himself for urine tests for a total of 45 occasions since the commencement of his supervision period on 12th August 2017.

> **FACTS RELATING TO \[Possession of Methamphetamine\] CHARGE**

> 19    On 5th December 2018, when CNB officers raided Block 305A Anchorvale Link #XXX Singapore 541305 and arrested the accused for suspicion of having consumed controlled drugs, the accused was also found to be in the possession of one (01) packet …of crystalline/powdery substance, which was seized and marked as “C3”. On 6th December 2018, the seized exhibit…was submitted to the HSA for analysis.

> 20    On 31st December 2018, \[HSA analyst\] Teo Hui Ping… issued a certificate under Section 16 of the Misuse of Drugs Act…stating that upon analysis, the crystalline/powdery substance was found to contain not less than 0.24 gram of Methamphetamine. Methamphetamine is a Class A Controlled Drug…

> 21    The accused is not authorized to be in possession of a Controlled Drug… has thereby committed an offence under Section 8(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185.

> 22    Prior to the commission of the offence, the accused had, on 10th April 2013…been convicted of an offence of Possession of a Controlled Drug under Section 8(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185, and was sentenced to 2 years’ imprisonment, which conviction had not been set aside. He is thereby liable to be punished with enhanced punishment under Section 33(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185.

> **FACTS RELATING TO 18th CHARGE (Cheating)**

> 23.    The victim is Adeline She.

> 24.    On the 8th of March 2019…the accused did cheat the victim, to wit, by deceiving the victim into believing that he had a Festive Hotel Stay to sell to the victim, a fact which the accused knew to be false and by such manner of deception, the accused dishonestly induced the victim to deliver property, by transferring $220 to him for the purchase of a hotel stay at the Festive Hotel, Singapore.

>> (a)    Cash amounting to S$40/- (forty Singapore dollars only);

>> (b)    One UOB debit card belonging to one Fung Chin To;

>> (c)    One NRIC (bearing the number SXXX) belonging to one Fung Chin To; and

>> (d)    One Singapore Driving License…

> 32.    The total value of the stolen items is S$340/- (three hundred and forty Singapore dollars only).

> 33.    The accused admitted finding the complainant’s wallet and dishonestly misappropriating the aforementioned wallet and its contents.

> 34.    The complainant’s wallet, item (a) and (b) were not recovered and no restitution was made. Item (c) and (d) were recovered from the accused’s possession and they were seized as case exhibits. By virtue of the foregoing, the accused had committed an offence of dishonest misappropriation of property, an offence punishable under Section 403 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

> 38.    On 10 May 2019, the complainant asked the accused for his NRIC number and driving license, in order to verify from records in the Singapore Police Force’s “eddies” Portal, if the accused was a disqualified driver, and thereby not eligible to rent a car. The accused, knowing that he was disqualified from driving, committed forgery by making a false electronic record of the victim’s NRIC and Singapore driving license card, which he had previously found on Sentosa Island… The accused used a mobile application, and replaced the victim’s photo on an electronic record of the victim’s NRIC and driving license card with his own photo… The accused forwarded the forged documents to the complainant thereby dishonestly inducing the complainant to enter into a car rental contract…

> 39.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence of forgery for the purpose of cheating punishable under Section 468 of the Penal Code.

## Reasons for Sentence

#### Prescribed Minimum Punishments

9       The LT1 charge is punishable with a mandatory imprisonment sentence of between 5 to 7 years and mandatory caning of between 3 to 6 strokes. In other words, this charge carries a mandatory sentence of at least 5 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane. The enhanced possession charge is punishable with a minimum imprisonment sentence of 2 years up to a maximum of 10 years.

10     The other proceeded charges do not carry minimum imprisonment sentences.

#### Parties’ Submission on Sentence

11     The accused was represented by counsel. Even though some of the proceeded charges were punishable with either a fine or imprisonment, counsel for the accused asked for a fine to be imposed only in respect of one charge i.e. driving without insurance coverage.

12     The parties did not disagree materially in respect of the individual sentences to be imposed, at least not for the charges which would have an appreciable impact on the overall sentence. As regards the aggregate sentence, both the DPP and counsel were in agreement that the imprisonment sentences for 4 charges to run consecutively. They were also in agreement as to three of the four charges to run consecutively i.e. the charges for LT1, FRUT and forgery.

13     The key contention between the parties lay in the fourth charge to be ordered to run consecutively. Thus, counsel asked that the fourth charge be that for driving without insurance coverage (for which counsel had asked for a fine),[^1] whereas the prosecution submitted that the fourth charge be that for enhanced possession of drugs (which carried a mandatory imprisonment of 2 years).[^2]

14     The difference between their respective positions as to the total sentence was consequently two years apart. In other words, the prosecution submitted for a total sentence of at least 8 years’ imprisonment (plus caning) as opposed counsel’s submission for 6 years (plus caning). Suffice to state at this juncture that I disagreed with either sentencing approach in terms of the individual sentence for some of the offences and the number of charges to run consecutively and consequently, the aggregate sentence.

#### Sentences for Individual Charges

15     In a case like the present where the accused was to be sentenced on multiple charges, the sentencing court should first consider the appropriate sentence for each individual offence (_Seng Foo Building Construction Pte Ltd v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 243</span> at \[23\] and _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> (“_Shouffee_”) at \[26\]).

16     I therefore started by deciding what would be the appropriate sentence for the individual proceeded charges. The exercise would generally involve a consideration of the prescribed statutory punishment and a determination of where the individual case ought to situate within the statutorily prescribed punishment limits, having regard to the legal and moral culpability of the offender and the harm engendered, and also a consideration of the relevant sentencing precedents on the basis (as held in _Chang Kar Meng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 22</span> at \[73\]) that like cases should be treated alike. Further, given the adversarial nature of our criminal justice system, I also duly considered what the parties had broadly agreed to be the appropriate sentence in respect of the offence, unless there are very good reasons why the agreed and suggested sentence would not be appropriate and therefore should not be imposed e.g. where the sentence is wrong in principle or wholly disproportionate to the facts of the case or the circumstances of the offender.

##### LT1 charge

17     In respect of the LT1 charge, this was the most serious of the proceeded charges. As noted above, the minimum prescribed sentence for this offence is 5 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane. Notwithstanding that the accused pleaded guilty, which was a weighty mitigating factor, I did not agree with counsel (or the DPP for that matter) that the accused be sentenced to only the minimum prescribed sentence. I considered that the accused had a number of other drugs-related TIC charges. In general, the effect of taking into consideration outstanding charges (particularly charges that are similar) is to enhance the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed in respect of the proceeded charges (_PP v UI_ \[2008\] 4 SLR (R) 500 at \[38\]).

18     In the present case, the TIC charges included a second LT1 charge and a second enhanced possession charge. As instructed by the CA in _Suventher Shanmugam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 25</span> at \[39\]:

> ..outstanding offences which are taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing are to be treated as aggravating the offence or offences proceeded with. This is especially so where the offences taken into consideration are similar to the principal offences.

19     The TIC charges were certainly similar and indeed provided the context for the proceeded charges and which showed, in particular, that the proceeded LT1 charge was not a one-off incident and which formed part of an escalating pattern of criminality (_Vasentha d/o Joseph v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 197</span> at \[57\]).

20     It is never axiomatic that the mandatory minimum sentence for an LT1 offence (or any other offence for that matter) must be imposed simply on account of a plea of guilt. The court must consider all relevant offence and offender specific factors before deciding on the most fitting sentence. Thus, in _PP v Lee Kah Poh_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 224</span>, the offender in that case pleaded guilty to, _inter alia_, two LT1 charges. The court disagreed with the defence that the mandatory minimum imprisonment sentence ought to be imposed for both charges. Instead, the court considered the antecedents, the TIC charges and the fact that later LT1 offence was committed when the offender was on court bail for the earlier LT1 offence, and imposed 5½ years’ imprisonment for the earlier offence and 6 years’ imprisonment for the later offence. These higher than mandatory minimum sentences in respect of the LT1 offences were upheld on appeal.[^3]

21     Therefore, I had no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that an uplift of 6 months would be appropriate in respect of the present proceeded LT1 charge against the accused.

##### enhanced possession charge

22     In respect of the proceeded enhanced possession charge, the prosecution asked for the minimum prescribed sentence of 2 years’ imprisonment to be imposed. On the other hand, counsel surprisingly asked for an uplift of 6 months’ imprisonment.[^4] I did not think it was necessary to add an uplift to the minimum prescribed imprisonment sentence for this charge. As I had already considered the drugs-related TIC charges (excluding the TIC charges for FRUT offences) which had the effect of enhancing the proceeded LT1 charge, I did not think it would be appropriate or necessary consider the same TIC charges. There was therefore no question or consequence of ‘double-counting’.

##### FRUT charge

23     I next considered the proceeded FRUT charge. The accused failed to turn up for a urine test on 4 April 2019 at the Ang Mo Kio Police Division. I considered that the SOF revealed that the accused had failed to present himself for urine tests for a staggering 45 occasions since the commencement of his supervision period on 12th August 2017.[^5] There was also the added consideration of the 2 TIC charges for FRUT offences. The same legal principles concerning the enhancing effect of TIC charges considered above were equally relevant here. There was also no question of ‘double-counting’ as I had not, up till this point, considered the effect of the TIC FRUT charges. Considering the number of occasions that the accused had absconded and the 2 TIC FRUT charges, I agreed with the prosecution that the appropriate sentence to be imposed for the proceeded FRUT charge would be 6 months’ imprisonment. This was close to and not very much higher that counsel’s submission for 5 months’ imprisonment.

##### cheating charges

24     I turn now to the 2 proceeded cheating charges. Together with the 6 other TIC cheating charges, these charges form a series of offences which the accused committed against multiple unsuspecting victims by selling them non-existent hotel stay packages. By virtue of such a scam, the victims were cheated into giving the accused sums of money ranging from $150 to $400 but were not given the hotel stay vouchers in return. No restitution was made to any of the victims. Further, the same enhancing effect also apply in relation to the similar TIC cheating charges. In addition, I also take judicial notice that the number of scam incidents has significantly increased over the last year or two. The prevalence of a particular type of offence is recognised as a circumstance of an offence which may attract the principle of general deterrence (_PP v Law Aik Me_ng 2 SLR(R) 814 (“_Law Aik Meng_”) at \[25\]).

25     The precedents cited by the prosecution indicate a range of sentences between 2-6 months’ imprisonment for various scams where multiple victims are cheated. In the present case, I also considered that the accused has prior convictions for cheating offences (under s 419 of the Penal Code) on two occasions in 2011 and 2013. As such, the accused has shown himself to be an unrepentant serial cheat in every sense of the description and accordingly, an uplift beyond the 2-3 months’ imprisonment that the parties had suggested, was justified as an added measure of specific deterrence. Therefore, I imposed a sentence of 5 months’ imprisonment for each proceeded cheating charge.

##### forgery charge

26     As for the charge for forgery for the purpose of cheating, the accused was sentenced to 5 months’ imprisonment. Counsel had in fact asked for a higher sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment.[^6] Therefore, the accused would not have any issues with this individual sentence and I will not elaborate any further. In any event, the sentence imposed is consistent with that for the proceeded cheating charges.

##### dishonest misappropriation

27     As regards the charge for dishonest misappropriation of a wallet, I agreed with prosecution’s submission for a sentence of one month’s imprisonment. This sentence was consistent with the precedents cited by the prosecution and also in keeping with the accused’s antecedents (as highlighted below) for the same offence and also for theft. Notwithstanding that the sentence was higher than the 2 weeks’ imprisonment that counsel had sought, this charge was not one of the charges ordered to run consecutively and therefore, the difference was effectively moot.

##### driving under disqualification

28     As for the charge for driving under disqualification, both parties submitted for the same imprisonment sentence of one month with disqualification. This sentence was consistent with the sentence imposed on appeal in _Soyed Foysal Ahamed Pavel v PP_ (MA9155 of 2018). Therefore, I imposed one month’s imprisonment with the mandatory 12 months’ disqualification in respect of this charge.

##### driving without insurance coverage

29     Finally, in respect of the remaining proceeded charge for driving without insurance coverage, I disagreed with counsel’s submission for only a fine to be imposed. The accused committed this offence in March 2019 which was barely three months after his last conviction in December 2018 (highlighted below) for the exact same offence. I agreed with prosecution’s submission that the custodial threshold has been crossed and a short custodial sentence would be appropriate. The accused was sentenced to one week's imprisonment and disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for 12 months.

#### No Compelling Mitigating Factors

30     I considered whether there were mitigating factors (apart from his plea of guilt) which operated in favour of the accused and which were material and compelling enough to justify a reduction in the individual sentences as indicated above. Counsel set out, for the court’s consideration, the accused’s personal circumstances which led to the commission of the offences.[^7] Essentially, counsel informed that after he was released from prison, the accused was unable to find a job even though he had tried to upgrade himself when he was in prison. The accused’s sister was also undergoing a divorce and that had upset him too. In light of these financial and emotional issues, he committed the offences in “moments of weakness.”[^8]

31     I did not find any of the accused’s financial or personal circumstances to be mitigating, let alone exceptional or compelling. Ultimately, these circumstances had no bearing on the charges and the accused’s overall culpability in committing the multiple offences.

32     The accused could not claim that the offences were committed in moments of weakness because it is evident from many of the charges that the offences (especially those of cheating and forgery) would have required some degree of scheming, premeditation and practice of deceit on the part of the accused. Counsel’s point that the accused had tried to upgrade himself may have been relevant to suggest that the accused was unlikely to reoffend and therefore, the need for specific deterrence would be lessened. However, it was observed in _Stansilas Fabian Kester v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 185</span> that another aspect of the principle of deterrence i.e. _general_ deterrence (which operates to educate and deter other like-minded members of the general public by making an example of the particular offender) would displace the mitigating value of any rehabilitative prospect (as manifested by past good conduct and good works) of the offender.

33     Ultimately, I was of the view that there were no exceptional or compelling mitigating factors to merit a reduction of the individual sentences as indicated above.

#### Antecedents

34     The accused has previous criminal antecedents. For ease of reference, I reproduce the table of the accused’s antecedents that was helpfully provided by the prosecution.[^9] The table groups the antecedents into the 4 separate occasions when the accused was convicted before the courts as follows:

35     In addition, the court was informed that the accused was also ordered to undergo a period of 24 months’ drug supervision for drug consumption on two occasion on 17 March 2012 and 12 August 2017.

36     The antecedents were accepted by the accused. Counsel candidly acknowledged the antecedents and further grouped them into drugs-related, cheating-related and driving-related categories.[^10] In short, it was plain, even to counsel, that the accused was a recalcitrant offender who had reoffended by committing the same or similar types of offences.

37     The accused’s drugs-related antecedents were apparent on the face of the present charges which carry enhanced punishments. His last imprisonment sentence was in April 2013. It was for, _inter alia_, drug consumption and possession. His total aggregate sentence then was slightly above 7 years’ imprisonment. The convictions in 2013 would constitute the predicate offences for his present LT1 and enhanced drug possession charges. He was sentenced to a total of five years and eight months’ imprisonment with 8 strokes of the cane. From the record, he was placed on drug supervision in August 2017 which meant that he would have been released around that date. His present proceeded LT1 and drug possession charges were committed in December 2018. That would mean that he re-offended not too long after his release from prison. This was certainly not a case of an offender having stayed away from drugs for a long period before re-offending.

38     As indicated earlier in these grounds, I had considered the relevant antecedents of the accused in deciding on some of the individual sentences.

#### Global sentence

39     After determining the individual sentences, I considered what would be the appropriate global sentence. In other words, I had to decide how many and which imprisonment sentences to be ordered to run consecutively. At the very least, s 307 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Chapter 224) stipulates that two imprisonment sentences must run consecutively since there are three or more imprisonment sentences in this case. As a general principle, multiple wrong-doing is viewed more severely given the greater harm done. A further general principle is that an offender who has committed unrelated offences ought to be separately punished for each offence: _PP v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 799</span> at \[41\]. This is consonant with the principle that the offences relating to the violation of different legally protected interests ought to run consecutively (_see Muhammad Sutarno bin Nasir v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 2 SLR 647</span> at \[22\]. All these principles are simply threads of the broad principle that the eventual aggregate sentence must adequately reflect the offender’s overall culpability.

40     The present accused pleaded guilty to 9 charges. There was no question (and parties agreed) that the longest term of imprisonment (i.e. for the LT1 charge) must run consecutively. In fact, as noted above, the parties also agreed that the sentences for the FRUT charge and forgery charge should also run consecutively. As to the fourth consecutive charge, I did not agree with the prosecution that it should be the enhanced possession charge because that would unduly skew the combination of charges towards being drugs-centric. Prosecution’s suggested combination of sentences would also wholly ignore the accused’s culpability in respect of the series of cheating charges which, in my view, was a critical component of his overall culpability. Likewise, I rejected counsel’s submission to include, as the fourth charge, the offence of driving without insurance. I felt that one of the cheating charges must rightly feature as one of the sentences to run consecutively. However, I agreed that one driving-related charge ought also to feature in the aggregate sentence, given the number of driving-related offences that the accused has committed now and in the past.

41     For completeness, I also did not agree with the prosecution’s alternative suggestion (if the court was minded to omit the enhanced drug possession charge from the mix of consecutive sentences) to enhance the individual sentences so as to add up to a total sentence of 8 years’ imprisonment that they asked for. That suggestion may lead to artificial enhancement of individual sentences just to achieve a desired global sentence.

42     In deciding on the appropriate aggregate sentence, I was again guided by the analytical framework for global sentencing laid down in _Shouffee_ at \[81\] and Menon CJ’s reminder at \[41\] to the sentencing court to guard against applying the one-transaction rule too rigidly and, more importantly, to _not_ lose sight of the enhanced culpability that is reflected in the multiplicity of the offences that the accused had committed. I had no doubt that in the present case, it would be wholly condign to order 5 of the charges to run consecutively, given the total number of charges (19), the number of proceeded charges (9) and the different types of offences committed against multiple victims over various distinct periods. The consecutive sentences in respect of the 5 charges were absolutely justified considering further:

> a.     that the charges represent different protected legal interests;

> b.     that the charges relate to separate and distinct offences which clearly fell outside the provisional one-transaction exclusion;

> c.     the overall criminality and culpability of the accused, taking into account the manner of commission of the offences and the role played by him particularly in deceiving the victims;

> d.     that some of the offences (e.g. the proceeded forgery charge) was committed after he had absconded from court bail; and

> e.     the particular need for specific and general deterrence in this case given the harmful effects of controlled drugs to society.

For these reasons, I ordered 5 of the charges to run consecutively.

43     After deciding on the sentences to run consecutively, I considered and concluded that the final aggregate sentence:

> i.     was sufficient and proportionate to the offender’s overall criminality (_Raveen Balakrishnan (supra)_ at \[73\]);

> ii.     was not substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious individual offence (_Shouffee_ at \[54\]);

> iii.     was not disproportionate to the charges and the facts and circumstances of the offences;

> iv.     was not crushing on the offender and entirely in keeping with his past records and future prospects (_Shouffee_ at \[57\]); and

> v.     was in fact lower than his last aggregate sentence served in 2013 of 7 years and one week’s imprisonment with 10 strokes of the cane.

## Conclusion

44     At the end of the day, the restraining rationale which underpins the totality principle in determining the individual and global sentences is that of proportionality in punishment (_Law Aik Meng_ at \[60\]).

45     Bearing that in mind, I am satisfied that having regard to the facts of the case, the multiplicity of the charges, the circumstances of the commission of the offences, and applying the sentencing principals of specific and general deterrence, I am of the view that the global sentence imposed was by no means excessive or crushing.
