### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## A.   Background

#### The Charges

1       The Accused, Mr Robel Md, a 32 year-old male Bangladeshi national was first charged in Court 23 on 21 December 2017. He had claimed trial to two charges under s 10(1) and punishable under s 10(2)(a) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Cap 91A, 2009 Rev. Ed.) (“EFMA”), namely a charge of being a self-employed foreigner engaging in the activities related to renovation services without a valid work pass in **MAC 912825-2017** and a charge of being a self-employed foreigner engaging in the activity of providing general construction work without a valid work pass in **MAC 912826 -2017**. The charges against him were as follows:

> **_MAC 912825-2017_** _\- Exhibit C1C (Amended Second Charge)_

> “...are charged that you, from sometime in December 2016 to 15 April 2017, in Singapore, were a self-employed foreigner without a valid work pass; to wit, you were engaged in the activities related to renovation services without a valid work pass, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 10(1) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Chapter 91A), punishable under Section 10(2)(a) of the same Act.”

> **_MAC 912826-2017_** _– Exhibit C2B (Amended First Charge)_

> “…are charged that you, on or about 12 May 2016 to 28 June 2016, at the corner of Bras Basah Road and Nicoll Highway in Singapore, were a self-employed foreigner without a valid work pass; to wit, you were engaged in the activity of providing general construction work without a valid work pass, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 10(1) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Chapter 91A), punishable under Section 10(2)(a) of the same Act.”

2       On 25 April 2019 and prior to the commencement of his trial before me, the accused discharged his Defence Counsel Mr A Revi Shanker. He then indicated that he wanted to find another lawyer. As the matter was fixed for a one-day hearing that day and I noted that this was the second lawyer he had discharged, I informed the accused that I would be proceeding with the trial. The accused then elected to act in person.

3       Prior to his discharge, Mr A Revi Shanker informed me that he had gone through with the accused the statements that were recorded from him, the photographs to be relied on by the Prosecution as well as the Prosecution’s sentencing position. He further indicated that the accused would be challenging his statements but was unable to indicate the basis of his challenge. After ascertaining from the accused his position in respect of his statements, I then proceeded to hear the trial in respect of the two proceeded charges in **MAC 912825 - 2017** and **MAC 912826 - 2017**.

4       At the conclusion of the trial and after a careful consideration of the evidence before me, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case on the two proceeded charges beyond a reasonable doubt. I did not accept his defence that he was not working during the material period as stated in the two charges. I found the Accused guilty and convicted him in respect of both charges in **MAC 912825 - 2017** and **MAC 912826 - 2017**. I imposed the following sentences:

> (i)      **MAC 912825 - 2017** – a fine of $7,000 in default 30 days’ imprisonment and

> (ii)      **MAC 912826 - 2017** – a fine of $5,000 in default 20 days’ imprisonment**.**

The global sentence imposed on the Accused was a total fine of $12,000 in default 50 days’ imprisonment.

5       Dissatisfied with my decision, the Accused filed a Notice of Appeal against his conviction and sentences in respect of both charges on 6 May 2019. He had paid his global fine of $12,000 on 25 April 2019.

6       I now provide the reasons for my decision.

#### The Trial

7       During the trial, the Prosecution had called eight witnesses to the stand to give evidence against the accused. They were:

## B.   Undisputed Facts

9       The undisputed facts in the present case are set out below:

> a)     The accused is a foreigner who is a Bangladeshi national;

> b)     The accused had been issued with a work permit on 20 January 2016 and his employer at the material time was Shin Hong Engineering Pte Ltd;

> c)     His work permit was cancelled on 9 May 2016 after he lodged an injury claim while working as a plumber and pipe fitter for Shin Hong Engineering Pte Ltd;

> d)     A Special Pass was issued to the accused by the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) on 9 May 2016;

> e)     The accused was aware that as a condition of this Special Pass, he was not allowed to engage in any form of employment, or in any business, profession or occupation during the validity of the said pass unless he was issued with a valid Work Pass;

> f)     The accused was aware that if he engaged in such activities without a valid Work Pass, he may be liable to prosecution under the EFMA;

> g)     During the period between 12 May 2016 to 28 June 2016 and December 2016 to 15 April 2017, the accused was a Special Pass holder;

> h)     On 12 May 2016, the accused was present at the construction site at the corner of Bras Basah Road and Nicoll Highway. He was seen inside the construction site wearing a yellow coloured safety helmet and rubber boots;

> i)     The accused was the subject in the surveillance conducted on 12 May 2016 by PW1, Mr Lim Yong Yi, a private investigator engaged by Shin Hong Engineering Pte Ltd to confirm if the accused was working while on Special Pass. PW1 had prepared the investigation report, _Exhibit P1;_

> j)     MOM was conducting investigations into the possible infringement of the EFMA in respect of the general construction works done by the accused at the Hyundai Engineering and Construction site at Bras Basah Road and the Nicoll Highway when the accused’s long statement (“_Exhibit P2_”) was recorded on 29 June 2016;

> k)     The accused was arrested by the police on 15 April 2017 at Blk 744 Woodlands Circle for doing illegal work;

> l)     MOM was conducting further investigations into the possible infringement of the EFMA in respect of the renovation works done by the accused for Carpentry Design Works Pte Ltd when the accused’s long statement (“_Exhibit P3_”) and further statement (“_Exhibit P4_”) were recorded.

> m)     Pursuant to their investigations, MOM had preferred two charges against the accused and his two caution statements in respect of the charges were recorded on 7 December 2017.

## C.   Issue

10     The main issue before me was whether the accused was a self-employed foreigner who had engaged in work in Singapore at the material time without a valid work pass. His defence was essentially a bare denial that he had worked or was self-employed during the relevant periods as stated in the two charges.

#### Accused’s statements

11     As part of its case, the Prosecution had sought to rely on the accused’s long and caution statements i.e _Exhibit P2_ to _Exhibit P6_ that were recorded from him by the various MOM investigation officers. Prior to the commencement of the trial, I had asked the accused whether he was challenging the voluntariness of his five statements on the basis of either threat, inducement, promise or oppression or that he was challenging the accuracy of the statements. He had indicated that he was challenging the _accuracy_ of the statements and stated that the interpreter did not read the statements fully to him. He maintained that the statements were not correct and that he was challenging the accuracy of the statements. As he did not challenge the _voluntariness_ of the five statements, they were all admitted as part of the Prosecution’s case.

12     I now turn to the Prosecution’s evidence against the accused.

## D.   The Prosecution’s Case

#### Evidence of the accused working while on a Special Pass

13      _PW1_, Mr Lim Yong Yi was a private investigator engaged by the accused’s employer’s Shin Hong Engineering Private Limited to establish whether the accused had been working while on Special Pass status. On 12 May 2016, PW1 had conducted surveillance on the accused by observing and recording his activities from 0723 hours to 1200 hours.

14     He testified the accused was observed leaving his place of residence where he took the MRT from Aljunied MRT station to City Hall MRT station and then walked into a construction site at the corner of Nicoll Highway and Bras Basah Road. He further testified that the accused was seen wearing a yellow coloured safety helmet and rubber boots. He later climbed down into the underground pit where he was seen carrying metal rebars and other items. The surveillance on the accused was terminated sometime at noon when the accused came out from the pit.

15     PW1 then prepared his investigation report on 23 May 2018 (“_Exhibit P1_”) which included video clips and photographs of his observations on the accused. PW1 concluded that from his observation, the accused appeared neither to be physically restricted nor disabled by any injury sustained at his previous workplace and was working for another company while on Special Pass status.

16     The next Prosecution witness was _PW2_, Husniyati Binte Omar who was a sales director of Carpentary Design Works Pte Ltd sometime between 2016 and 2017. She testified that the company had specialised in renovation works including hacking, carpentry, painting as well as interior design. She further testified that she was introduced to the accused by her supplier, one Mr Victor from VC Creations. She had engaged the accused to do hacking works, clearing of debris etc and he did work for her company on an ad hoc basis. She would pay the accused in cash based on the number of hours and the number of days he worked.

17     PW2 gave evidence that she had not applied for a valid work pass for the accused as she had assumed that he already had a valid one while working for Victor. She further gave evidence that her company had not conducted further checks to see if the accused could work for the company.

#### The accused’s various statements

18     The Prosecution had also relied on the accused’s long statements and caution statements to establish that the accused was working at the material time namely:

> i)     on or about 12 May 2016 to 28 June 2016, at the corner of Bras Basah Road and Nicoll Highway and

> ii)     From December 2016 to 15 April 2017, in Singapore.

### 29 June 2016 long statement

19     In his long statement recorded by _PW3_, Mr Leow Siaw Sun on 29 June 2016 at 2.30 p.m.(_“Exhibit P2”)_, the accused had stated[^1] that a few days after he was issued with the Special Pass on 9 May 2016, he had worked at the Bras Basah and Nicoll Highway worksite until 28 June 2016. Upon being shown the photographs from PW1’s investigation report, the accused had confirmed in his statement that he was the person found working at the worksite in Bras Basah and Nicoll Highway. PW3 testified that he had accurately recorded the information given by the accused through an interpreter during the recording of _Exhibit P2_. He also testified that there was no threat, inducement, promise or any oppression when the statement was recorded from the accused.

20      _PW4_, Ms Khurshida Yesmin is a foreign language interpreter since 2004. She testified that on 29 June 2016 she had interpreted the accused’s statement (“_Exhibit P2”)_ from the Bengali language which was recorded by PW3. She also testified that PW3 would speak in English and would ask questions or clarify the facts of the accused. She would then interpret to the accused in Bengali and based on the reply given to her by the accused in Bengali, she would then interpret the same to English for PW3 to record in the statement.

21     She gave evidence that she had correctly translated what the accused told her and that had been reduced to writing. She also testified that she had read over and explained the whole statement in Bengali to the accused after it was recorded. According to PW4, the accused was invited to sign and he was given the chance to add anything or amend anything in his statement. She testified that there was no threat, inducement or promise from either PW3 or herself when _Exhibit P2_ was recorded from the accused.

### 17 April 2017 long statement

22     In his long statement recorded by _PW5_, Mr Lim Ming Jun on 17 April 2017 at 3.35 p.m. (_“Exhibit P3”)_, the accused had stated he was given a Special Pass sometime in May 2016[^2]. He further stated that he was caught doing housekeeping work while on Special Pass in May 2016. In his statement the accused had stated[^3] that in December 2016, his friend Moktar had introduced him to a company i.e. Carpentry Design Works Pte Ltd to do renovation work. He had gone to work in this company even though he knew that he was not allowed to work while he was on a Special Pass. He started work on 24 December 2016 and each week he worked about 3 to 4 days and for about 8 hours each day.

23     In addition, the accused stated that on 15 April 2017, he was arrested by the police when he had gone to a house at Blk 744 Woodlands Circle to collect his tools[^4]. He had stated that he did not want to continue working for the company anymore as he was not paid his salary since December 2016.

24      _PW6_, Ms Chakravarti Aroti is a foreign language interpreter for over 15 years. She testified that on 17 April 2017 she had interpreted the accused’s statement, _Exhibit P3_ from the Bengali language which was recorded by PW5. She testified that the recorder had posed the questions to the accused in English and that she would interpret the question to the accused in Bengali. After the accused gives an answer in Bengali, she would interprete it back in English. The information would then be reduced into writing. After the statement was recorded, PW6 testified that she would read the statement back to the accused in Bengali.

25     She also testified that the accused was invited to make any amendments, alterations and deletions to the statements. She gave evidence that in _Exhibit P3_, there were amendments made to the statement and this was when the accused was invited to make amendments to the statement. She also gave evidence that there was no threat, inducement, promise or oppression by her to the accused before or during the recording of the statement. She testified there was nothing which would amount to threat, inducement, promise or oppression by the investigating offier i.e. PW5 during the recording of the statement. She also confirmed that the statement (“_Exhibit P3_”) was an accurate interpretation of what the accused had told her.

### 18 July 2017 further statement

26     In a further statement recorded by _PW7_, Wang Swee Huat (“William Wang”) on 18 July 2017 at 12.35 p.m. (“_Exhibit P4_”), the accused had clarified that although he was hired by PW2’s husband, PW2 was the “boss” of Carpentary Design Works Pte Ltd. He testified that PW2’s name is ‘Husniyati’ and that she was one of the witnesses to the present case. He stated that he was paid daily for his work and he worked as a hacker and cleared rubbish at the worksites.

27     PW7 gave evidence that there was no threat, inducement, promise or oppression from him to the accused at the time of the recording of the statement. He also gave evidence that the accused had not objected to providing the statement in English.

### 17 December 2017 caution statements

28     PW7 was the recorder of both of the accused’s caution statements that were recorded on 17 December 2017. He testified that he had arranged for an interpreter, i.e. _PW8_ Ms Nayeema Islam, unlike for the further statement (“_Exhibit P4_”) as he had more time to arrange for one. He also testified that during the recording of the caution statements, he had read the first charge and second charge to the accused. The interpreter, PW8 then interpreted and explained the respective charges to the accused in Bengali. PW7 gave evidence that after the charges were interpreted to the accused, the latter was invited to state whatever he wanted to say.

29     PW7 testified that for the first charge in _Exhibit P5_, the accused had stated the following:

> “The reason I had committed this offence was because I need to support my family in Bangladesh.

> I had taken a large amount of loan from the bank in order to work in Singapore.

> I also had a two month old baby at that time.

> I am sorry.”

PW7 also testified that the accused had provided the above statement in Bengali to him and the interpreter had interpreted it to him. PW7 confirmed that he had written the statement down accurately and the statement was read back to the accused in Bengali. PW7 gave evidence that the three of them namely, the accused, the interpreter and PW7 then signed on the statement.

30     PW7 testified that the same process was repeated for the second charge in _Exhibit P6_. PW7 further testified that in _Exhibit P6_, the accused had stated the following:

> “Same as first charge.

> However, I would like to add on that I needed money to sustain myself.”

PW7 confirmed that he had written the statements down accurately and the statements were read back to the accused in Bengali. PW7 gave evidence that the three of them namely, the accused, the interpreter and PW7 then signed on the respective statement. PW7 testified that when the caution statements were recorded, there was no threat, inducement, promise or oppression from himself or the interpreter.

31      _PW8_, Ms Nayeema Islam is a foreign language interpreter since 2000. She testified that on 7 December 2017 she had interpreted two of the accused’s caution statements (“_Exhibit P5”_ and _“Exhibit P6”)_ from the Bengali language which was recorded by PW7.

32     She also testified after she was introduced to the accused, PW7 had read the charges and the punishment in English. She then interpreted the charges and the punishment to the accused in Bengali. After that the accused was invited to sign on the charges and he signed the charges voluntarily. She gave evidence that when the accused was asked whether he wanted to say anything in relation to the charges, he gave his statement in Bengali and she translated it to English to PW7 and he wrote down what was said. She further gave evidence that whatever the accused had told her had been interpreted and recorded accurately.

33     PW8 gave evidence that the three of them namely, the accused, herself and PW7 then signed on the statements. PW8 testified that when the caution statements were recorded, there was no threat, inducement, promise or oppression from herself or the investigating officer.

## Close of Prosecution’s Case

34     After having heard the evidence of all eight witnesses for the Prosecution, I found that the Prosecution had made out its case against the accused in respect of both the charges in **MAC 912825 - 2017** and **MAC 912826 – 2017** on which he was being tried. I also found that there was some evidence which was not inherently incredible that satisfied each and every element of the two charges. Accordingly, I called upon the accused to give evidence in his own defence. The accused elected to give evidence in his defence.

## E.   The Defence’s Case

35     When the accused was invited to state his defence to the two charges, he testified that the video footage which was part of the investigation report in _Exhibit P1_ and admitted through PW1, was not conclusive proof that he had worked at that worksite. He also testified that if he was working anywhere in a worksite, there should be a signed card and the recording of the time.

36     The accused gave evidence that in respect of the first charge on 12 May 2016, he had gone to the construction site to meet his friend and it happened that he had given some helping hand to his friend. According to the accused, if he had really worked at the work site, he should have been charged earlier as the recording was taken in 2016.

37     The accused further gave evidence that his statement i.e _Exhibit P2_ was taken under duress because he was threatened and ‘they’ were very angry. According to the accused, they had talked to him in an angry tone. When asked why these assertions were not raised earlier on despite being asked his basis for challenging his statements prior to the commencement of the trial, he testified that he was told not to state it then and that later he would have the opportunity to raise this.

38     The accused testified that for the second charge, he was brought to the police station and the officer came to record his statement. He further testified that he had told them that he did not work. His statement was recorded and he asked to sign the statement. According to him, he was not informed of the punishment and the nature of the offence. The accused gave evidence that the statements recorded from him was not given by him by his own will.

39     During his cross-examination, the accused testified that he was aware that he could only work in Singapore with a valid work pass and not a Special Pass. He also testified he repaid the monies owing by him in order to come to Singapore namely to his employment agent as well as to others from the insurance monies he received from his work accident.

40     When asked by the Prosecution as to how he had sustained himself in Singapore after the cancellation of his work pass, the accused testified that his friend and his younger brother who was also living in Singapore had helped him.

41     During his cross-examination, when the Prosecution referred the accused to the investigation report (“_Exhibit P1_”) as well as the photographs at the worksite, he maintained that he was helping a friend and he had not worked for any gainful purpose. He testified that he had gone to the worksite so that his friend, Milon could take him to the latter’s residence. He had wanted to meet his friend to borrow money to send to his family in Bangladesh. He further testified that he did not have to go inside the worksite and that he was outside the worksite. He could meet his friend as he was a storekeeper at the worksite.

42     In respect of the second charge, the accused did not agree with the evidence of PW2. Although he did not deny meeting with her, he testified he had gone to Woodlands to help his friend Moktar collect his belongings as the latter was going back to Bangladesh.

43     During his cross-examination, in relation to his statements relied upon by the Prosecution namely, _Exhibits P2_ to _P6_, the accused essentially maintained that the portions of the statements that implicated him were not accurately recorded whereas the information which did not implicate him were accurately recorded.

## F.   Assessment of Evidence

44     The accused faced two charges under s 10(1) and punishable under s 10(2)(a) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Cap 91A, 2009 Rev. Ed.) (“EFMA”), namely a charge of being a self-employed foreigner engaging in the activities related to renovation services without a valid work pass in **MAC 912825-2017** and a charge of being a self-employed foreigner engaging in the activity of providing general construction work without a valid work pass in **MAC 912826 -2017**.

45     In view of the undisputed facts as set out at paragraph 9 above, the sole issue before me was whether the accused had engaged in work in Singapore at the material time without a valid work pass. His defence was essentially a bare denial that he had worked or was self-employed during the relevant periods as stated in the two charges namely on or about 12 May 2016 to 28 June 2016 and from December 2016 to 15 April 2017.

### MAC 912826-2017

46     In the present case, I accepted PW1’s unequivocal evidence that on 12 May 2016 that the accused appeared neither to be physically restricted nor disabled by any injury sustained at his previous workplace and was working for another company while on Special Pass status. This was further corroborated by the objective evidence from video clips and photographs that were annexed in his investigation report. The accused himself did not dispute that he was the person in the video clips and photographs. Consequently, I did not accept the accused’s evidence that he was at the worksite to visit his friend to borrow money to send to his family in Bangladesh and was merely helping him out without any gainful purpose.

47     In respect of the entire period from 12 May 2016 to 28 June 2016, I found that this was evidenced by his own contemporaneous long statement _Exhibit P2_ recorded by PW3 on 29 June 2016 where he indicated that he had worked a few days after being issued his Special Pass and that his last day working at the site was on 28 June 2016. In the present case, I saw no reason to disbelieve his own statement that was recorded shortly after his last day of work at the Bras Basah Road and Nicoll Highway worksite. I also did not accept his belated assertion after his defence was called that his statement was given under duress and not of his own freewill. Prior to the commencement of the trial, I had ascertained from the accused his position regarding his statements. He had only stated that he was challenging the accuracy of his statements.

### MAC 912825-2017

48     I now deal with the second offending period where the accused had worked namely from December 2016 to 15 April 2017. PW2 had testified that she had engaged the accused to do hacking works, clearing of debris and he did work for her company on an ad hoc basis. She would pay the accused in cash based on the number of hours and the number of days he worked. I was mindful that PW2 was unable to state the actual period when the accused had worked for her company.

49     This was corroborated by the accused himself when he stated in _Exhibit P3_ that sometime in December 2016 he started to do renovation work for PW2’s company as he was having money problems and needed to feed his child. According to his own contemporaneous statement, he stated that he started working for the company from 24 December 2016. He was arrested on 15 April 2017 when he went to a house at Block 744 Woodlands Circle to collect his tools as he did not want to continue working for the company. Similarly, I saw no reason to disbelieve his own statement that was recorded shortly after his arrest by the police on 15 April 2017.

50     Based on the evidence before me, I found that his bare denial that he was working at the material time was clearly an afterthought in his attempt to evade the consequences of his actions. This was evident during his cross-examination when he maintained that the portions of the various statements that implicated him were not accurately recorded whereas the information which did not implicate him were accurately recorded. In my view, it was clear from a careful consideration of the facts before me, that the evidence of the accused was both internally and externally inconsistent.

51     Consequently, I rejected the accused’s bare assertion that he was not working during the relevant period of time as reflected in the two proceeded charges. Based on a careful consideration of the evidence before me, I found that the accused’s attempts to exculpate himself was wholly incapable of belief, primarily because of the evasive and shifting nature of his evidence whenever confronted with an inconsistency. Accordingly, I disregarded his evidence as I found that he was not a credible witness.

52     Based on the evidence before me, I found that the Prosecution had established beyond a reasonable doubt that:

> i)     sometime in December 2016 to 15 April 2017, in Singapore, the accused was a self-employed foreigner who had engaged in the activities related to renovation services without a valid work pass in **MAC 912825-2017** and

> ii)     On or about 12 May 2016 to 28 June 2016, at the corner of Bras Basah Road and Nicoll Highway in Singapore, the accused was a self-employed foreigner who had engaged in the activity of providing general construction work without a valid work pass in **MAC 912826 -2017**.

Accordingly, I found the accused guilty and convicted him on both these charges under s 10(1) and punishable under s 10(2)(a) of the EFMA.

## G.   Antecedents

53     The Accused was untraced.

## H.   Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

54     In the Prosecution’s oral address on sentence, it was submitted that from the sentencing precedents tendered for offences under s 10(1) EFMA, the benchmark sentences for plead guilty cases had been ranging from about $4,000 to $5,000 for one month of illegal employment. It was further submitted that if it was longer, the fines had ranged from $4,500 to $8,500.

55     Accordingly, for the first amended charge i.e. **MAC 912826 - 2017** as the offence was for about one month and 16 days, it was submitted that the fine should be about $5,000 considering that he had claimed trial. It was the case for the Prosecution that as he did not plead guilty, the usual discount should not be given to the accused.

56     In respect of the second amended charge i.e. **MAC 912825 - 2017** as the period of offence was about four months, it was submitted that the fine should be about $7,000. It was submitted that the second offence was committed after he was investigated for the first offence. Not only did the accused know that he should not work under a Special Pass but he knew he was arrested for a similar offence previously. Hence, a higher fine should be imposed on him.

## I.   Mitigation

57     In his mitigation, the accused asked to be given a second chance and for the Court to release him. He submitted that he has a small child and a family to look after. He further submitted that he felt that he had not committed any crime.

## J.   The Sentences

58     The prescribed punishment for an offence under s 10(1) and punishable under s 10(2)(a) EFMA is a fine not exceeding $20,000 or to imprisonment not exceeding 2 years or to both. In determining the appropriate sentence, the various sentencing factors that a Court considers would include the period of self-employment, nature and type of industry and the offender’s eligibility in obtaining a work pass. The usual sentence for a first offender for such an offence under s 10(1) EFWA is a fine.

#### Sentencing considerations

59     In the present case, the accused is a foreign national who was issued with Special Pass by MOM on 9 May 2016 in view of his injury claim. The accused was aware that as a condition of this Special Pass, he was not allowed to engage in any form of employment, or in any business, profession or occupation during the validity of the said pass unless he was issued with a valid work pass. He was also aware that if he engaged in such activities without a valid work pass, he may be liable to prosecution under the EFMA. Nevertheless, the accused had sought self employment not once but on two occasions even though he did not possess a valid work pass. Hence, this could not be considered as a one-off offence.

60     In addition, the accused had claimed trial to both charges under s 10(1) EFWA and even after being convicted on these charges, he continued to maintain that he had not committed any offence. This is indicative of his lack of remorse for these offences. As he had claimed trial to the two charges, he was not entitled to any discount in sentencing which is usually afforded to an accused who had pleaded guilty.

61     In my view the fact that he had continued to commit the second offence despite being investigated by MOM is an aggravating factor. In addition, despite being aware of the consequences, I noted that the period of offending for the subsequent offence in **MAC 912825 - 2017** was much longer i.e. four months than the period of one month and 16 days in **MAC 912826 - 2017**. I also regarded this is as an aggravating factor.

62     After a careful consideration of the above factors including the period of employment as well as the sentencing precedents before me, for the first offence in **MAC 912826 - 2017**, I imposed a fine of $5,000 in default 20 days’ imprisonment. In respect of the second offence in **MAC 912825 - 2017**, I imposed a fine of $7,000 in default 30 days’ imprisonment. This is after taking into account the longer period of employment and the fact that the accused had re-offended despite being under investigation for the first offence. Under such circumstances, an uplift in his fine was warranted. His global sentence for the two charges were therefore a global fine of $12,000 in default 50 days’ imprisonment. In my view, the sentences imposed were just and appropriate based on the factual matrix of the present case.

63     Dissatisfied with my decision, the accused had filed a Notice of Appeal against his conviction and sentences in **MAC 912825 - 2017** and **MAC 912826 - 2017** on **6 May 2019**. He had paid his global fine of $12,000 on **25 April 2019**.
