### District Judge Eddy Tham Tong Kong:

## INTRODUCTION

1       The two accused persons claimed trial before me to 4 charges under section 417 read with section 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008) (“the Penal Code”).

2       In the course of the trial at the close of the Prosecution’s case, as a material witness in respect of one of the respective charges (DAC 934371/2019 in respect of the accused Andruew Tang You Liang (“Tang”) and DAC 934345/2019 in respect of the accused Koryagin Vadim (“Vadim”)) was overseas and the Prosecution was unable to secure the attendance of the witness, the Prosecution withdrew that charge against each of the accused persons.

3       At the end of the trial in respect of the three remaining charges, I found both accused persons guilty and convicted them on all the charges. Thereafter I sentenced them as follows:

> i.      **Tang**: 1 week’s imprisonment per charge with two sentences to run consecutively giving a total of **2 weeks’ imprisonment**.

> ii.      **Vadim**: 2 weeks’ imprisonment per charge with two sentences to run consecutively, giving a total of **4 weeks’ imprisonment**.

4       Both accused persons have filed a notice of appeal against conviction and sentence.

5       I now set out the grounds of my decision in respected of the three convicted charges.

### The charges

6       The two accused persons claimed trial to the three charges of abetment by engaging in a conspiracy with each other to cheat banks in the following manner: during opening of a bank account for a company, Tang deceived the bank into believing he was the “ultimate beneficial owner” (“UBO”) of either the company or the account, thereby intentionally inducing the bank to omit to consider who the ultimate beneficial owner of either the company or the bank account was in the bank’s decision to open the bank account for the company, which the bank would not have omitted to do so if the bank was not so deceived and this was likely to cause harm to the bank in reputation, which offence was committed in consequence of the abetment.

7       A sample of the charge in respect of Tang (DAC 934369/2019) is set out here:

> … on or about 3 October 2014, in Singapore, did abet by engaging in a conspiracy with one Koryagin Vadim to cheat the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited (“OCBC”), and in pursuance of that conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing, you deceived OCBC into believing that you were the ultimate beneficial owner of Babo Group Pte Ltd (“Babo”), thereby intentionally inducing OCBC to omit to consider the ultimate beneficial owner of Babo in OCBC’s decision to open a bank account for Babo, which OCBC would not have omitted to do if OCBC were not so deceived, and which was likely to cause harm to OCBC in reputation, which act was committed in consequence of your abetment, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 417 read with Section 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008)

8       The summary of the different charges are as summarised in this table below for ease of reference:

## THE PROSECUTION’S CASE AND THE DEFENCE

9       The Prosecution sought to prove each of the following elements of the charge under section 417 of the Penal Code as well as the element of conspiracy between Tang and Vadim:

> (a)     Tang deceived the banks into believing that he was the UBO of the companies or the bank account to be opened for the company in question;

> (b)     At the material time of the opening of the bank accounts, he was in fact not the UBO;

> (c)     The banks were therefore intentionally induced to omit to consider the true UBO in their decisions to open the bank accounts in question;

> (d)     This was likely to cause harm to the banks in reputation; and

> (e)     This was done in pursuance of a conspiracy between Tang and Vadim.

10     The Defence essentially disputed each of these elements and had put forth various arguments.

11     Before I set out the evidence and the arguments on each element in turn and my analysis and conclusion on it respectively for the three charges, I will set out the background facts which are not in dispute.

## UNDISPUTED BACKGROUND FACTS

12     Vadim is a Russian national who had first come to Singapore in 1996. Subsequently he started a company to organise professional wrestling events in 2002. In the course of that business, he came to know Tang who was one of the wrestling trainees.

13     In order to supplement his income, he started another business to provide corporate business services. He incorporated a company called MEA Business Solutions Pte Ltd (“MEA”) and he was the director of that company. MEA was involved in the business of incorporating companies through instructions of customers. In addition to incorporating the companies, MEA would also provide service of opening bank accounts for those companies on behalf of the clients as well as providing a local nominee director and shareholder.

14     In running MEA, Vadim would engage such local directors and nominees and one such person was Tang. Tang would be paid for his services of being a nominee director and shareholder. He will be paid more if his services include opening of bank accounts. It was agreed between Vadim and Tang that Tang would merely act as a nominee director and shareholder and was not involved in the running of the company. Tang would at all times act wholly on the instructions of Vadim. Tang has no idea as to what the company was incorporated for and had no interest in running those companies. Once the company has been incorporated and the bank account opened, Tang’s role and involvement with those companies would end after signing over any paperwork given to him by Vadim such as the transfer of shares to someone else as instructed by Vadim or declaration of trust whereby he is to hold the shares on trust for someone else. Any bank tokens or cheque books issued by the banks would either be sent directly to MEA or to Tang who would hand them over to Vadim.

15     Tang also did not know anything about the clients or the business that the incorporated companies would be involved in. Any information about the companies that he was able to provide to the banks during the opening of bank accounts were fed to him by Vadim who in turn had obtained such information from MEA’s clients.

16     It is also not disputed that Tang had signed on all the bank account opening forms for the 3 charges in question and that his particulars had been filled in the respective forms under a section on declaration of beneficial ownership either by himself or the bank officer on his behalf.

17     In addition to filling in the account opening forms, Tang also had to submit an Accounting and Corporate Authority (“ACRA”) document on the company as well as the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the company. The respective bank officers would check who the shareholder was based on the ACRA document and do a series of checks using the internal bank platform as well as and internet search for any adverse reports on the three companies and the shareholder, namely, Tang. No adverse report was found. There was nothing to suggest that Tang was not the ultimate beneficial owner of the company in which the accounts were being opened for as far as the bank officers were concerned. In all the ACRA documents for the three companies, Tang was on record the sole shareholder.

18     I will now move onto the evidence adduced by Prosecution in support of the elements of the charge.

## THE ANALYSIS OF THE EVIDENCE IN RESPECT OF EACH ELEMENT OF THE CHARGE

### Did Tang represent to the Banks that he was the UBO of the companies/the bank account?

19     The Prosecution called the 3 bank officers who had opened the accounts at the material time. They had testified that they could not, from their current memory, recall dealing with Tang specifically due to the passage of time. I found this to be reasonable in the circumstances due to the long passage of time and the fact that they would have dealt with numerous clients over the years. The specific events would have taken place about 5-7 years prior to the trial. It would have been unlikely for them to recall specifically how they dealt with Tang on that particular day. All 3 witnesses also were not able to recognise Tang during the trial as the customer who had opened a bank account on those dates.

20     They had instead relied on the normal procedure that they would have carried out for any customer seeking to open a corporate bank account.

#### The opening of Maybank bank account for Sensetec

21     For the Maybank account, PW1 Ms Chong Chai Joon (“Ms Chong”) was the bank teller who dealt with Tang in respect of the opening of a corporate account for Sensetec.

22     She stated that during the process she would ask the customer to declare who the beneficial owner was. She confirmed that in the present case, the customer had declared he was the beneficial owner when he filled in the column in the account opening form of the bank account (exhibit P1) in response to the question of who the beneficial owner of the account was[^1]. She pointed to the part where Tang’s particulars were filled up by himself[^2] under the column with the heading of “Declaration on Beneficial Owner”.

23     I note that just above this column before his particulars had been filled in are these printed words:

> “The following person(s) ultimately own and /or control the management of the account(s)”

24     Further, just after the particulars of Tang, are these words printed as follows:

> “I/We acknowledge and confirm that Maybank shall be entitled to rely on my/our declaration above on the identity(ies) of and information relating to the Beneficial Owner(s) of the Account.”

25     It is also noted that just above the particulars filled in by Tang, there are 2 options with both boxes unticked. The 2 options are:

> “Yes, \*I/We \*am/are the beneficial owner(s) of the account(s)”; and

> “No, \*I/We \*am/are not the beneficiary owner(s) of the account(s)”.

26     Ms Chong admitted, when asked why there was no checking on either of the boxes, that she had overlooked this part. However, in my view, this omission is insignificant as Tang had nonetheless filled up his particulars under this column declaring that this person “ultimately own and /or control the management of the account(s)”.

27     Defence Counsel for Tang merely asked Ms Chong if she was present throughout the time of the account opening process with Tang. Ms Chong answered that there may be times she may be attending to other matters but ultimately she would be there to explain and answer questions, particularly when the customer was signing the account opening form. It was never put to her that she did not ask Tang to declare if he was the beneficial owner.

28     However, when Tang was on the stand, his evidence was that he could not remember exactly what had transpired during the account opening save that he was just told where to fill in his particulars. When asked specifically about the declaration of beneficial ownership, he claimed that he did not understand what the phrase meant but he just filled up the form when told to do so. There was also no explanation given to him on the meaning of beneficial owner. The excerpt of the questions during his evidence-in-chief is as follows:

> Q:    There are two boxes there, "yes" and "no".

> Mm-hm.

> Q.    Why didn't you tick either of those boxes?

> A.    I didn't know what the beneficiary owner was, yeah.

> Q.    Why didn't you ask the officer what a beneficial owner was?

> A.    I don't know. I did not ask her, yeah.

> Q.    Why didn't you ask her?

> A.    Because maybe at that point of time I thought that it wasn't very important, right, to declare.”[^3]

29     It is clear from the above exchange that Tang clearly did take note that he was filling in his particulars as the beneficial owner. His position was only that he did not really understand what this phrase meant and thought that it was not very important. He had not challenged PW1 Ms Chong’s evidence through his counsel that she did enquire with him as to who the UBO was and he had confirmed that he was by filling in the form under the declaration of beneficial owner.

30     I accordingly found that Tang clearly knew that he was declaring that he was the UBO of the Maybank account when he had filled up in his particulars in the Maybank account opening form at the said section.

#### Opening of the OCBC bank accounts in respect of Evoque

31     As for the OCBC bank accounts, PW3 Tan Yi Hui (“Ms Tan”) testified that she was the bank officer who dealt with Tang on the opening of the bank account for Evoque. She confirmed that she had checked with Tang based on her usual practice if he was the UBO and if so to fill up the relevant part of the form as the UBO. The relevant excerpt of her evidence is as follows:

> A.    \[page\]27 is the declaration of the beneficial owner, usually I would get the client to fill this out, the beneficial owner, to fill this page up.

> Q.    Why is that so? Why would you do that?

> A.    The beneficial owner is an important declaration. It would be better for the BO to know what they are declaring. Usually, before they fill this page up I will give them a brief explanation of what a beneficial owner is and ask them if they are the beneficial owner. The declaration page itself also has a short description of what it means and if they have any questions I would have answered.”[^4]

32     The short description appearing on the form \[exhibit P6\] states that

> “l/We declare that the following person(s) ultimately own and/or control the management of the company”

33     Tang, when he was on the witness stand, testified that the OCBC staff did not explain to him what the UBO is. However this was never put to Ms Tan when she was cross-examined by his Defence Counsel. The relevant excerpt of the cross-examination on this point made it clear that her evidence was not challenged:

> Q:    Did you tell Andruew to declare that he was the beneficial owner in this form?

> A.    No, I would ask him is he the beneficial owner.

> Q.    Did you ask him?

> A.    Yes, I did, based on my practice.

> Q.    Do you recall asking him?

> A.    I would ask.

> Q.    It is your practice to ask?

> A.    Yes.

> Q.    On every occasion?

> A.    Yes.

> Q.    So it is impossible to you that you would not have asked him whether he was the beneficial owner?

> A.    Yes, based on my practice I would always ask.

> Q.    All right. So you ask if he is the beneficial owner and once he confirms that, he is he fills it in, is that what you are telling us?

> A.    Yes.

> Q.    Right. So you don't tell him that he is the beneficial owner and to put his name down, right?

> A.    No.[^5]

34     It is clear therefore that Ms Tan’s evidence was never challenged that she did check with Tang if he was the beneficial owner and once he had confirmed it, he had filled in his particulars at the relevant section.

35     I therefore similarly found that Tang had clearly knew that he was declaring himself that he was the UBO when he signed the application form in respect of the opening of the bank account for Evoque.

#### Opening of the OCBC bank accounts in respect of Babo

36     PW5, Jason Chew Guo Sheng (“Chew”) testified that he was the bank teller from OCBC who dealt with Tang in the opening of the bank account in respect of Babo.

37     With regard to the portion on beneficial ownership, Chew testified that he would check with the customer as to who the beneficial owner of the company was and if he said he is the person, Chew would fill in his particulars under this section for him[^6].

38     Under cross-examination by the Defence Counsel for Tang, the following questions and answers were in response to the issue of the declaration of beneficial ownership:

> Q.    Now I am going to move on. What do you understand by the term "ultimate beneficial owner"?

> A.    Okay, ultimate beneficial owner, right, is the person that has control over the company bank account as well as also has control over the company.

> Q.    Over the account and the company?

> A.    Yes.

> Q.    That is your understanding?

> A.    Yes.

> Q.    Was this your understanding seven years ago as well?

> A.    Yes, of course.

> Q.    Now, in 2014, right, did you explain, did you usually explain, what an ultimate beneficial owner was to companies?

> A.    Yes, of course.

> Q.    Did you use the expert words "ultimate beneficial owner"?

> A.    I cannot remember whether I said the word "ultimate" but beneficial owner definitely.[^7]

> ……

> Q:    Now, I am going to -- let's stay on page 2 and this is obviously a declaration on beneficial ownership of the company. Has OCBC here made an enquiry as to who the beneficial owner of the company is?

> A.    I don't quite get your question. Make that enquiry?

> Q.    Okay, OCBC is asking a person to declare that they ultimately own and/or control management of the company. In fact I will go up above. It says "Declaration on beneficial ownership of a company." So OCBC is asking a person to declare who the beneficial owner of the company is, right?

> A.    Yes.

> Q.    And so they have made an enquiry about who the beneficial owner of the company is, right?

> A.    Yes.

> Q.    And then it had been filled in by a person.

> A.    Yes.

> Q.     **_Does this mean the bank has verified now that this is the beneficial owner of the company? Well, I will make it simpler. The bank has asked a question, asked a person to declare and the person has declared._**

> A.     **_Okay._**

> Q.     **_So because of this declaration now the bank knows this is the beneficial owner of the company, right?_**

> A.     **_Yes._**

> Q.     **_The bank has verified with the person that this person is the beneficial owner of the company, right?_**

> A.     **_Yes, correct_**.[^8]

> ……..

> Q:     **_Page 2 there is a declaration required and in having this form filled up have you, as a banking officer on behalf of the bank, enquired about who the beneficial owner is?_**

> A.     **_Yes._**

> Q.     **_Yes. And you in getting this information about who the beneficial owner is and filling it in, have you verified therefore with the person who the beneficial owner is?_**

> A.     **_Yes.[^9]_** (my emphasis)

39     Hence, it is very clear, that regardless of whether Tang understood the full meaning of UBO, the evidence of Chew was never challenged on this material fact: that he did enquire with Tang on who the beneficial owner was and had confirmed with Tang that he was the beneficial owner before filling in the form, Tang’s particulars.

40     Accordingly, I found that similarly that Tang was fully aware that he was making a declaration that the was the UBO of Babo when he signed on the application form. Additionally, when Tang’s statement (exhibit P8) is examined, it further reinforced this conclusion.

### Did Tang understand the meaning of UBO when he made the declaration?

41     Tang claimed that despite signing and making the declaration that he was the UBO of the company or the bank account, he did not understand the meaning of UBO.

42     It is undisputed that Tang knew that he was acting merely as a nominee director and also a shareholder in name. In his evidence, he had admitted that he was approached by Vadim to play this role and he would be paid for his services. However, he claimed that in filling up the bank opening forms at the material times, he did not fully understand the meaning of UBO and hence he did not have any intention of causing the banks to be deceived into thinking he was the UBO and thus causing the banks to omit into considering who the actual UBO was when considering their decisions to allow the bank accounts to be opened by Tang.

43     The principal evidence relied on by Prosecution that Tang did know the meaning of UBO and he had intentionally deceived that banks was the statement made by Tang to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (“CPIB”).

44     All of Tang’s statements had been accepted by the Defence to have been voluntarily made and had been admitted into evidence without any challenge as to their admissibility.

45     When Tang was brought through his statement given on 1 August 2019 (exhibit P8) to Chief Special Investigator Lin Jue Hai (“CSI Lin”) during his examination-in-chief, he tried to dissociate himself from being the author of the words “beneficial owner” which had been used extensively in the statement. He claimed that the phrase was “thrown around” by CSI Lin to imply that the phrase was used by CSI Lin and not by him. The relevant excerpt is as follows:

> “Q:    So are these your words verbatim, yes or no, in this statement?

> A.    No, it's not -- not, it's not my words verbatim. The only difference, right, I feel that for this statement, is that there was the term "beneficiary owner" being thrown around, I guess. I'm not sure if -- no, sorry -- yeah, the term "beneficiary owner" was being thrown around in this particular statement.”[^10]

46     Hence he tried to give the impression that he did not know what the meaning of “Beneficial owner” was. However, he then contradicted himself by stating that he had been asked for his understanding and he had given his definition as someone who runs the account or owns the account. The relevant excerpt are as follows:

> “Q.    You were asked if you knew --

> A.    I was asked, yes. But I had no idea what a beneficial owner was.

> Q.    What did you say?

> A.    I gave an interpretation of that but I have no idea what a beneficial owner was, because I didn't know, I could say that I have no idea what a beneficial owner was, which I really do not know and I'd like to --

> Q.    Why didn't you know -- you couldn't say that you don't know what –

> A.    I just wanted to assist with investigations, that's all; I was just trying to be smart.

> Q.    Why didn't you ask the IO what a beneficial owner was?

> A.    I didn't know that I could ask the IO that, yeah.

> Q.    What interpretation did you give the IO about the term?

> A.    The persons who runs the account, that owns the account.”[^11]

47     I found that Tang clearly had a much better understanding of “beneficial owner” than he was prepared to concede.

48     Firstly, Tang should not be confused about this term when his statement was being recorded by CSI Lin as it was not the first time it was being used in a statement recorded from him. His Defence Counsel had admitted his earlier statement recorded by DHI Lam Seow Kin on 3 April 2018 (exhibit 2D2). At paragraph 7 he had stated:

> “The recording officer now asks me to elaborate on what I know about the companies that I act as a nominee director and shareholder for. I would like to clarify that I would either act as the nominee director and shareholder, or just as the nominee director. I would say I do not know much about these companies. **_I do not know who are the beneficial owners of these companies_** and what kind of businesses the companies conduct. I may have seen the names of the beneficial owners on documents such as bank forms but I would not have met or spoke to them.” (my emphasis)

49     Thus in the subsequent statement P8 at paragraph 18, when reference was made back to this paragraph 7 of 2D2, Tang was at pains to make it clear he was only a “nominee director” in contrast to the “beneficial owner”. Paragraph 18-9 of P8 states:

> “With reference to Para 7 of my previous statement, I am now asked by the recorder if I know the identity of the beneficial owners and the actual business of those companies that I signed as nominee director. I wished to elaborate that I do not know who the beneficial owners are. I have never met them before and I only know their names from the documents that I signed. Vadim will prepare a list of suppliers and the customers of the companies for me to open bank accounts for these company, and from there I will roughly know the kind of business these companies are in….”

50     Tang again by distancing himself from the beneficial owners made it very clear that he knew the distinction between the beneficial owners of the companies and his position as a nominee director. He reiterated this in court during his evidence-in-chief when he stated that

> “ In this whole process, right, I always told them that I'm just a nominee director, shareholder, I do not handle the transactions or whatsoever, so as far as I'm the concerned, I think the beneficiary owner is the one who handles the transactions, but I don't handle the transactions.”[^12]

51     He was clearly asserting that he was not the beneficial owner and was probably concerned that he would be implicated for any wrongdoing such as money laundering that could have been committed by such beneficial owners[^13]. Crucially, Tang never claimed that he did not understand the meaning of the term “beneficial owner”.

52     Secondly, I found that the term “beneficial owner” was clearly not a foreign term to Tang at the time of the statement recording of P8 in 2019. This was because he had executed quite a number of documents prepared by Vadim earlier from 2015 to 2016 in relation to the 3 companies. For Babo and Evoque, the documents executed were entitled “Indemnity Agreement”[^14]. The second paragraph states that Tang in providing such services as a local Director “shall act upon the instruction of the Beneficial Owner whose name is indicated below”. As for Sensetec, the document is entitled “Agreement for Appointment of Nominee Director”[^15]. The Agreement provides at page 1 that the “_Company and the Beneficial Owner have requested the Nominee Director_ \[referring to Tang\] _to act as the director of the Company and upon the terms and conditions as stated therein_”. In respect of Sensetec, Tang also executed another document called “Declaration of Trust” to acknowledge and declare that he was holding the shares in Sensetec as a nominee and trustee for “the Beneficiary”[^16].

53     Under cross-examination, Tang agreed that from the very start, Vadim had explained to him that he would be signing on documents like an indemnity agreement and declaration of trust. He also confirmed that he knew that the indemnity agreement was to show that he was just a local director in name and was not responsible for the operations of the company and the declaration of trust was to show that whatever shares he had held in the company, it was for the benefit of someone else[^17].

54     This term would therefore have been familiar to Tang and he was clearly lying when he claimed ignorance of this phrase or its meaning during the recording of his statements.

55     Finally, paragraph 32 of P8 set out a series of questions and answers which made clear that Tang knew that the banks would not have opened the account for him if he had informed them that he was not the UBO. He also explained why he made such a declaration when it was not appropriate for him to do so. The questions and answers are thus crucial as they speak of the state of mind of Tang at the material time of the opening of the bank accounts. I therefore set them out here in full:

> “Q1:  If you had told the bank that you are not the UBO, and that you were just signing documents and getting paid to do so, would the bank still have open\[ed\] the account with you?

> A1:    No, I would not think the bank would have still opened the account with me. The bank would want to know the actual UBO who run the business itself for their background information.

> Q2:    If you had told the bank that you are not the UBO and that you did not know if the funds were legitimate or not, would the bank still continue to maintain the account with you?

> A2:    No, I would not think the bank would have still maintained the account with me. This is because I was not the one who ran the operations and it can be a risk for them to not know if the funds were legitimate or not. I wish to add that the bank would have checked the legitimacy of the funds via supporting documents which I have been submitting to them on behalf of Vadim.

> Q3:    Do you think it is appropriate for you to declare to the bank that you are the UBO of the company, when in actual fact that you are not?

> A3:    No, I do not think it is appropriate for me to do so.

> Q4:    Do you think it is appropriate for you to omit \[disclosing\] to the bank of the actual UBO of the company?

> A4:    No, I do not think it is appropriate for me to do so.

> Q5:    Why did you still do it, when you know it is not appropriate for Para \[32\] Q3 and Q4?

> A5:    This is because I was under the impression the business is legitimate. When I agreed to be the nominee director for those companies, it was part of the request by Vadim to open the bank account as well and furthermore, I was paid to do it. The actual UBO is based on overseas and the process will delay if the actual UBO has to come down to Singapore. If I did not declare to the bank that I am the UBO, the process will unlikely to go through. I was just trying to expedite and smoothen the process of opening the bank account and help the establishment of those company in Singapore.”

56     The Defence Counsel tried to argue that Tang was answering the questions based on knowledge at the time of the statement recording which he had acquired over the course of time from the point of the opening of the bank accounts. However, from the answer given at A5, it was clear that Tang was talking about his motivation for making the declaration that he was the UBO at the material time of the opening of the bank accounts “when it was not appropriate for him to do so”. He was obviously answering the question on his state of mind at the material time of the charges. If he did not have this intention in the first place, it would be illogical for him to give this answer of “trying to smoothen the process of opening the bank account”.

57     Tang’s statement clearly set out his frame of mind as he was being asked why he had made the declarations at the material time. Tang clearly knew that he was thus declaring that he was the UBO to the bank officers at the material time of the charges and his reason was to expedite the opening of the bank accounts. Tang himself could not explain why he had given this reason to the CPIB officer when his own Defence Counsel had asked him several times to explain his response to Question 5. In the end, he could only answer lamely, “I am not sure why”. The excerpt is as follows:

>   
| 

“Q.

 | 

You were asked why you still omitted to the bank the actual UBO of the company when you know it is not appropriate and you gave your response below. Can you explain this response and why you responded in this way?

 |
| 

A.

 | 

I think because this was my second time, all right, interrogated by the CPIB, of course I felt pressured, right, and then I feel that there was some wrongdoing on my part. They made me feel that way, you know, like, they suggested that I did something wrong. So, yeah, I just wanted to assist in the investigations. I wanted to cooperate, hence I give out that statement, yeah.

 |
| 

Q.

 | 

What do you mean they suggested that you had done something wrong?

 |
| 

A.

 | 

I mean from the way they questioned me and stuff, yeah.

 |
| 

Q.

 | 

How --

 |
| 

A.

 | 

Like I said, like the term of the UBO thing and the BO thing and they keep saying like I concealed, I concealed, when in actual fact I really had no idea what was going on.

 |
| 

Q.

 | 

In this response you have said that if you did not declare that you were the UBO, the process will unlikely go through. Why did you say that at this interview in 2019?

 |
| 

A.

 | 

I think what I meant was that because I feel that if I told the banks that I'm the local director and the shareholder, it would help expedite the process of opening the bank account, so that was my intention.

 |
| 

COURT:

 | 

If you told the bank that you are the --

 |
| 

A.

 | 

The local director and shareholder of the company, that it would help expedite the process of opening the bank account.

 |
| 

COURT:

 | 

But this is not what it says here.

 |
| 

A.

 | 

Yes, but that term, you know, I always have -- I had the impression of that. It could be a lot of factors involved but I had the impression of that, yes.

 |
| 

COURT:

 | 

The impression of what?

 |
| 

A.

 | 

To say that -- what I wanted to tell them across that -- I wanted to tell them I'm just the nominee director, local director and the shareholder.

 |
| 

COURT:

 | 

But here, the sentence says, "If I did not declare to the bank I am the UBO". Your explanation here is different from this statement.

 |
| 

A.

 | 

Yeah, because I have no idea what the term of the UBO was, so I came up with that assumption.

 |
| 

COURT:

 | 

So what was the assumption?

 |
| 

A.

 | 

My assumption is that I'm just a -- I'm the nominee director, yeah, that I wanted to expedite the process, so that's why I said I'm the nominee director.

 |
| 

COURT:

 | 

It doesn't say that "If I declare to the bank that I'm the nominee director, it will smoothen the process".

 |
| 

A.

 | 

Yes, if I declared to the banks -- yes, your Honour, if I declared to the bank that I was the nominee director and the shareholder, I felt that it would help expedite the process of opening the bank account.

 |
| 

MR ABHILASH:

 | 

The court's question is slightly different.

 |
| 

A.

 | 

Right.

 |
| 

Q.

 | 

What you're saying now is that if you declared to the bank you were the nominee director or the local director would expedite the process, but the point the honourable court is making and what the court wants to know about is here, the words "nominee director" and "local director" are not used. Here the word used is the UBO. If I have heard your Honour correctly, the real question is why did you use the word UBO here? Did you use it, is there a reason for why you used this word?

 |
| 

A.

 | 

I think it was suggested to me, lah, by the CPIB.

 |
| 

Q.

 | 

What do you mean it was suggested to you by the CPIB?

 |
| 

A.

 | 

Because the term of the UBO and BO has always been thrown inside those statement, yeah.

 |
| 

Q.

 | 

Why did you say "If I did not declare to the bank that I'm the UBO" - why didn't you say "If I did not declare to the bank that I'm the local director or nominee director", why did you say UBO, that's the question?

 |
| 

A.

 | 

I'm not sure why.

 |
| 

Q.

 | 

You're not sure?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

I'm not sure why.”[^18]

58     From the above, Tang was really fumbling with his answers to try to come up with a reasonable explanation for his paragraph 32 in P8. He tried to suggest that he had asserted that he had declared himself to be the nominee director or local director, that would expedite the process. Clearly that would have been an illogical and untenable position. If he had indeed declared himself to be only a nominee director, rather than expediting the account opening process, it would have jeopardised his chances of getting the bank account successfully opened. Hence, he finally conceded he is not able to explain his response to the questioning by CPIB. The irresistible conclusion from his response to CPIB is that Tang was well aware that he was declaring himself to be the UBO of the respective companies as otherwise, the banks might not have allowed the bank accounts to be opened if they knew that he was not the true UBO. He had clearly intended to cause the banks to omit to consider who the true UBO was.

#### Argument that the Accused persons could have just gone only to DBS Bank as the bank account opening form did not have a declaration of UBO

59     The Defence adduced the evidence that the bank account opening form of DBS did not contain such a declaration of UBO. Hence, it was argued that had Vadim and Tang intended to induce the banks to omit considering the true UBOs of the companies, they could have easily opened all the bank accounts with DBS.

60     I was not persuaded by this argument. First, it is noted that Vadim and MEA had provided services to many clients and had opened more than 50 bank accounts. It would have been difficult to restrict all the accounts to just one bank. Vadim had admitted giving a statement to CPIB that he had instructed one of his nominee directors not to open 2 accounts with one bank to ensure successful opening of the bank accounts[^19]. Even though Vadim in court stated that this was just his guesswork as no one actually made clear what is required of him, the crucial point is that this was a factor in his consideration. At the end of the day, he could not have foreseen that he would be prosecuted for these acts and thus did not confine to transacting with only one bank. If he had restricted to opening bank accounts with only one bank, he would have risked inviting questions being asked which might then have impeded the opening of the bank accounts. Vadim’s primary objective was the successful opening of bank accounts and that would be his priority.

61     Finally, it is also noted that in one instance, a particular client had requested for an account to be opened with a specific bank. The email dated 9 September 2014[^20] from one Anastasia Chernova from Confideri to Vadim, requesting for the incorporation of Evoque, stated explicitly that “\[a\]n account must be opened with OCBC Bank”. Therefore it was also not entirely within his control to transact with only one bank.

62     In conclusion, I found that Tang clearly understood the meaning of UBO and that he had knowingly declared that he was the UBO to the banks with the intention to prevent the banks from enquiring into the true UBO of the companies or the bank account. **This finding would have satisfied the elements of the offence set out at paragraph 9(a) and (c) above**.

### At the material time of the opening of the bank accounts, was Tang in fact the UBO?

63     Tang clearly, from his statements, took the position that he was not the UBO at the material time. He took a lot of pains to assert that he knew nothing about the operations of the companies and that he had never met the UBOs of the companies. However, if it turns out in fact that he was the UBO at the material time of the companies, then a vital plank of the prosecution’s case would have been removed and an essential element of the charge would not have been proven. This would be regardless of the subjective view of the Tang or Vadim at the material time.

64     Hence, the Defence for both accused persons and in particular Vadim had put forth the argument that Tang was in fact the UBO at the material time of the opening of the bank accounts.

65     Vadim had explained it in this manner. His clients only became the UBO after they had made payment for his services, and this took place only after the bank accounts had been opened. He attempted to show this by producing documents such as declaration of trust which was only executed after the opening of the bank account for Evoque.

66     He thus argued that until monies were paid, his clients had not become the UBO of the companies and that Tang together with MEA were the joint UBOs of the companies. This is set out in his answers here given during his cross-examination:

> Q.    Until the customer pays for the company, you are saying it does not belong to the customer. Is that what you're saying?

> A.    Yes.

> Q.    The company then belongs to MEA, correct?

> A.    I would say the better answer would be that it belong collectively to MEA and its nominee director.[^21]

67     I found this distinction drawn by Vadim that Tang was the UBO until he signed over his rights _via_ the Declaration of Trust or payment made to Vadim or MEA to be contradicted by the evidence.

68     Tang was clearly acting on instructions on Vadim throughout the process from the very first moment when he was named as the only shareholder of the company. It was admitted by Tang both in his statements as well as his evidence in court that he could not independently make any decision on the company and he has no right to touch any funds in the bank account without instructions from Vadim. Even if the initial deposit into the bank account was made by him, it was clearly upon a reimbursement basis and on behalf of Vadim or MEA. Thereafter, Tang would have no right to utilise the funds in the bank accounts after they have been set up regardless of whether any transfer of his shares had been carried out yet to the new beneficial owners. He would also have no control over the funds after the opening given that any bank tokens or cheque books would be given to Vadim or to MEA. The following evidence in Court by Tang during his cross-examination by the Prosecution made his position very clear:

> Q.    Okay. I want to talk about the money that was put into the bank accounts.

> A.    Mm-hm.

> Q.    The money would either be provided by Vadim, or, if you paid first, Vadim would pay you back, correct?

> A.    Yes, that's the case.

> Q.    In both cases, ultimately the money is Vadim's, it belongs to MEA Business Solutions?

> A.    Yes, yes. Because I'm just a nominee director, it's not a company that I want to invest in. If it's let's say a company I want to invest in, or if I have shares in it, of course I'll put in my own money, lah, yeah.

> Q.    So you had no control over the bank account or the transactions in the account?

> A.    No.

> Q.    And this was the case from the start, right?

> A.    Yes, this is the case from the start. I mean --I mean, upon opening the bank account, right, I mean I was being able to control the bank account, but the thing is I did not touch the account whatsoever, lah, yeah.

> Q.    After you opened the bank account, the banking token was sent to Vadim's office, right?

> A.    Yes.

> Q.    You didn't have the banking token?

> A.    No, I didn't have the banking token.

> Q.    You also didn't have the chequebook?

> A.    In some instances they would give me the chequebook but when they give me the chequebook, I would give it to Vadim. Or it's just made to the mailing address, I would not be the one touching it at all, yeah.

> Q.    You were not able to perform transactions in the bank account as you wanted to, correct?

> A.    Yes, that is true.

> Q.    You would first had to ask Vadim?

> A.    Yes. [^22]

69     Vadim tried to argue that Tang was able to utilise the funds in certain situations during this short interim period to justify his position that he was the UBO. When asked to elaborate on these circumstances, he set out the following:

> i.     when he and MEA are uncontactable; and

> ii.     Tang had to close the company or pay out any expenses incurred by the company, or to pay taxes.[^23]

70     These circumstances cited by Vadim are clearly extreme as they would be brought about by a highly improbable situation where Vadim became permanently uncontactable and Tang would be compelled to deal with the authorities by virtue of him being the sole director to discharge his legal obligations under the law. Under normal circumstances, Vadim conceded that Tang would have to take instructions from him to deal with any matters concerning the company at this stage even before the company ownership was transferred[^24].

71     The truth of the matter is that Tang really had no control over the company’s affairs and would be acting merely as the hands and feet at the behest of Vadim during this initial period pending the signing of all the relevant documents to officially hand over the ownership to Vadim’s clients.

72     In this regard, it is noteworthy that for one of the documents produced by Vadim in relation to Sensetec, namely the Declaration of Trust, Vadim had actually caused it to be backdated to before the date of the opening of the bank account on 17 May 2016. This clearly showed that the intent of the parties was for Tang to act as merely a nominee director and shareholder right from the start and at no time assume the role of a beneficiary owner.

#### Argument that Prosecution was not able to show who the UBO was at the material time

73     The then Defence Counsel for Vadim, Mr Ibrahim also argued that none of the Prosecution witnesses was able to pinpoint who the UBO was at the material time. This point was also pursued by Mr Vadim later on when he represented himself. I found the argument to be wholly misconceived. The burden on Prosecution is not to prove who the actual UBO of the companies was at the material time but that Tang was not the UBO.

74     In conclusion, I found therefore that **Tang was clearly not the UBO of the companies or the bank account at the material time of the opening of the bank accounts, thus satisfying the element as set out at paragraph 9(b) above**.

### Would the omission by the banks likely to cause harm to the banks in reputation?

#### Is expert evidence required to prove this element of the charge?

75     The Defence has argued that in relation to the element of whether there will be likely reputational harm caused to the banks that expert evidence is required and that the Prosecution had failed to call higher ranking bank officers to the stand.

76     I found that there was no need for expert evidence to be called on this issue. It was well within the realm of general knowledge that a court could reach a conclusion as to whether a bank’s reputation would likely be harmed should it turn out that bank accounts had been used for nefarious purposes such as money laundering or cheating scams due to the banks allowing accounts to be opened by persons who were not the UBOs.

77     The Court is well equipped, based on general understanding of financial institutions, the role played by them in the financial world in dealing with corporate clients, businesses and the general public, to be able to appreciate what impact a scandal would have on them.

78     The Prosecution has correctly cited the holding of the Court of Appeal in _Chou Kooi Pang and another v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 205</span> at \[16\] that “expert opinion is only admissible to furnish the court with scientific information which is likely to be outside the experience and knowledge of a judge” and “if on the proven facts, a judge can form his own conclusions without help, the opinion of an expert is unnecessary”.

79     The Prosecution highlighted 2 cases which I found to illustrate the point that the Court can find that harm was caused or likely to be caused to the victims’ reputation without the aid of any expert witnesses. In _Public Prosecutor v Lim Ek Kian_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] SGDC 331</span>, the offender had forged an application form to transfer PARF/COE rebates and presented it to a Land Transport Authority (“LTA” ) officer, thereby inducing the officer to issue a certificate transferring the rebate from the named car owner to another person. The offender had argued that Prosecution had failed prove cheating as no evidence was led to show that the issuing of a new certificate by the LTA officer had caused or is likely to cause damage or harm to LTA officer in mind, body, reputation or property or that any harm was caused to LTA. The District Judge held at \[91\] that the offenders’ act is “_likely to cause damage or harm LTA’s reputation as an effective regulatory body in the eyes of .. . car owners and those in the vehicle industry_” and “_public regard and confidence in the integrity of LTA’s rebates transfer and registration system is likely to be shaken_” and that “\[_q\]uestions would inevitably be raised as to how LTA could have allowed the \[offender\] to perpetrate the wrongful transfer of .. rebates, and whether anything could be done to tighten up LTA’s rebates transfer process_”. On appeal, this finding of harm was affirmed by the High Court which held that the offender’s actions had “_compromised the reputation and integrity of the LTA’s system of rebates transfer_”, which “_would constitute the damage required under the second limb of s 415_” – _Lim Ek Kian v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] SGHC 58</span> at \[31\].

80     The second case cited is _Public Prosecutor v Balasundaram s/o Suppiah_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] SGDC 101</span>, where the offender had amended the figure in a duplicate public entertainment licence application form of a club to deceive the Public Entertainment Licensing Unit (“PELU”) into believing that the Singapore Fire Safety Bureau (“FSB”) had approved an occupancy load of 246 persons for the club premises, causing PELU to issue a licence with an approved occupancy load for that figure.

81     The District Court held at \[65\] that the deception “_struck at the heart of PELU’s approval procedures_”, “_made a mockery of PELU’s role as a screening and licensing authority and brought the integrity of the licensing system into disrepute and doubt_” and “_would constitute the requisite damage under the 2nd limb of section 415_”.

82     Similarly, I found in the present case, that there is no need for any expert evidence to assist the Court in finding whether there would be likely to be reputational harm caused to the bank by the omission of the bank to look into the true UBO of the companies.

#### Is harm likely to be caused to the reputation of the banks?

83     The bank officers of each bank gave evidence as to why they needed to conduct checks and various searches of adverse reports on the UBOs. This is part of their opening of account process of knowing who your customer is commonly known as Know Your Customer (“KYC”) obligation. This is part of the bank’s duty as imposed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”) to combat money laundering and other illegal activities such as terrorism financing, pursuant to MAS Notice 626 entitled “Prevention of Money Laundering and Countering of Financing of Terrorism”.

84     The bank officers were able to articulate why this was important. Ms Chong for the Sensetec account said this guideline of KYC was to make sure that there was no money-laundering involved[^25]. PW2, Ms Sharon Low Pei Chern, the bank service manager who had supervised the front line bank officers including Ms Chong, testified that the checks were done because of the risk of money laundering. She also said that if they failed to check on the true UBO, there would a “_reputational risk to the bank_” as they would not want to be seen to be a bank that will “_just open any accounts without finding out the true owners of the company_”[^26].

85     Ms Tan in respect of the Evoque bank account testified there will be reputational risk in that the bank would not want to be associated with any money laundering or fraud case[^27]. PW4, Mdm Choy Oi Leng, the customer service manager, who had authorised the opening of the bank account for Evoque, testified that the bank needed to know who the beneficial owner was so as to know who was actually controlling the account to “_avoid money-laundering, illegal activities_”[^28].

86     Chew, who had processed the opening of the bank account for Babo, testified that if it was publicised in the media that the bank had opened an account for someone who was not the UBO, “people might lose confidence in the bank”[^29]. During cross-examination, he further elaborated that his understanding on how this might happen was based on the perspective of an ordinary layperson:

> Q.    What statements would be put out so that the public would feel that the standing of OCBC is lowered? What type of statement would that be?

> A.    I have no idea. Perhaps somebody on the news might just say something with regards to the corporate -- when you open a bank account, yes. Then from there, if there is a very huge case that is involved and many people realise about this case, then probably it is eye-catching and probably the people of the public might feel "Hey, why is OCBC so careless?" Yes, so -- so from there perhaps it might affect the standing of OCBC.

> Q.    But you have no knowledge about statements that would be put out by OCBC, right?

> A.    No.

> Q.    So you are just saying this as an ordinary person, correct?

> A.    Based on, yes, correct.[^30]

87     I found that the bank officers were able to articulate clearly how the banks’ reputation could be harmed by the deception. The scenarios presented by the officers were something quite entirely foreseeable.

#### Argument that deception would make banks a victim of fraud and not lower its reputation

88     An argument was raised that even if it is publicised that the bank had wrongly opened the account, the bank’s reputation would still not be harmed. Defence Counsel for Tang had asked Ms Tan that if the declaration of the UBO turned out to be false, whether she had participated in Tang making a false declaration. He then made the point that the bank would thus be a victim of a fraud and its reputation would not have been harmed[^31].

89     I disagree with the view propounded that the bank’s reputation will not suffer if it was found that deception had been practiced on the bank in that the bank would merely be seen as a victim. Clearly, it would be important to a bank’s reputation and business to be viewed as an organisation that is vigilant and trustworthy. If they become embroiled in a money laundering scandal even if it turned out that they were the parties being deceived, whilst no charges may be levied against the bank or its officers, surely in the eyes of the public, questions will be asked about its level of vigilance and ability to guard against being hoodwinked. If this reputation is tarnished in that the bank is shown to be easily duped, it will invariably affect the public’s overall trust and confidence in the bank. This understanding of the effect of such an incident can be arrived by the court without the aid of any expert witness or officers from MAS or the higher echelons of the banks.

90     In this regard, I found Chew’s answer as set out at \[86\] above had captured this element so succintly in layman’s terms: the man on the street would ask “_Hey, why is \[the bank\] so careless?_”

#### The element of “likely” in relation to reputational harm

91     The Defence Counsel for Vadim had elicited a concession from the Investigation Officer Yap that out of the 30 charges that Vadim was facing, she did not find even one case where there was actual reputational damage caused. It was therefore argued that based on the statistics of zero out of 30, the Prosecution had failed to establish that this omission is “likely” to cause harm to reputation given that the likelihood is so low.

92     I found this argument is misconceived. It drew on the premise that since no wrongdoing had been uncovered in all the cases investigated, it _prima facie_ meant that such an occurrence of harm to reputation would therefore be very low. That is a flawed inference. The fact is that the banks had been deceived into thinking that the checks they have done were on the true UBO when that was not the case. The deception had caused the banks to completely omit conducting due diligence checks on who the UBO was and this had exposed the banks to the very real risk of dealing with illicit funds and being associated with such unlawful activities. If in fact money laundering or some other illegal activities did occur through the bank accounts as a result of this omission, it would be immediately clear that this will harm the bank’s reputation. The deception had completely undermined the banks’ efforts to comply with their obligation of KYC imposed by MAS on the banks.

93     The fact that no such illegal activities transpired merely meant little or no actual harm was in fact caused. However, there was likely harm to reputation in that the banks were in fact duped into opening bank accounts for persons whom they had wrongly believed were the true UBOs.

94      **In conclusion, I found that the element of “likely to cause harm to the banks in reputation” as set out at paragraph 9(d) above had been satisfied**.

### The element of conspiracy between Vadim and Tang

95     The crucial issue on this element of conspiracy lies in whether Vadim had a meeting of minds with Tang on Tang declaring himself to be the UBO to the banks in order to open the bank accounts. In determining this issue, I bore in mind that Tang was at all times acting on the instruction of Vadim to open the various bank accounts.

96     There is no direct evidence either in the statements given by Vadim or Tang or in their oral evidence in court that Vadim had told Tang specifically to declare himself to be the UBO to the banks.

97     However, as noted by the Court of Appeal in the case of _Public Prosecutor v Yeo Choon Poh_ \[1993\] 3 SLR (R) 302 at \[19\], the “_essence of a conspiracy is agreement and in most cases the actual agreement will take place in private in such circumstances that direct evidence of it will rarely be available_”. The Court had then gone on to set out how a conspiracy can be proved at \[20\]:

> One method of proving a conspiracy would be to show that the words and actions of the parties indicate their concert in the pursuit of a common object or design, giving rise to the inference that their actions must have been co-ordinated by arrangement beforehand. These actions and words do not of themselves constitute the conspiracy but rather constitute evidence of the conspiracy.

98     I found that there was evidence that Vadim knew that there was such a requirement on the person opening the bank account to declare that he is the UBO of the company way back in 2014.

99     In his statement to CPIB (exhibit P12), at \[106\]-\[110\], Vadim had confirmed that with reference to the OCBC account opening form in respect of a company called Suntronix, his particulars were entered under the declaration that he ultimately owned and managed Suntronix, although he was only a nominee director of the company. He further added that, to him, since the company was legitimate, there should not be a problem with him “_not informing the bank that the beneficial owners were someone else_”.

100    When confronted with this part of his statement (at \[115\]) that he had applied to open account for the beneficial owner because the beneficial owner did not want to come to Singapore, Vadim tried to downplay the accuracy of his statement by explaining that his response given to CPIB in 2019 was coloured by his gain of knowledge that was acquired from 2014 to 2019 and was not his frame of mind in 2014[^32].

101    I did not find Vadim’s explanation credible. He was being asked about a situation that had taken place in 2014, about why he did or did not do a certain thing. His response was clearly based on his understanding in 2014. I set out the following questions and answers that made it very apparent that he was referring to his frame of mind at the material time of the account opening:

> Q5:    Since you were not the beneficial owner of the companies which you were a director and or/shareholder of, why did you declare to them banks that you were?

> A5:    As I mentioned, it was done to facilitate account opening, to enable the accounts to come into operation sooner. It was for simplicity that I declared that I was the beneficial owner.

> …

> Q10:  Why can’t the beneficial owners open the bank accounts in Singapore by themselves?

> A10:  Because it is difficult for them to do so. It is a common practice for banks to reject a vast majority of account applications if it is by a foreigner. This is why it is difficult for foreigners to understand why it’s easy to open a company in Singapore but very difficult to open a bank account in Singapore.

102    Vadim was clearly answering a question about why he had opened the account as a beneficial owner and why the actual beneficial owners did not come to Singapore to open the accounts themselves. He was giving the answers in relation to the motivation for actions that had already taken place.

103    I therefore found that Vadim clearly did know that the opening of bank accounts did contain a declaration of beneficial owner as he started off his business acting as such a nominee director to open bank accounts before recruiting others like Tang as nominee directors to carry out this task. He has stated clearly to CPIB that the reason for doing so was to make it easier and expedite the process of the opening of the bank accounts.

104    Tang himself also had given strikingly similar reasons for declaring himself to be the beneficial owner of the bank account during the bank account opening stage. In his CPIB statement, as set out at \[55\] above, Tang provided a similar explanation of being expeditious and smoothening the process when he had declared himself to be the UBO when he was not:

> “The actual UBO is based on overseas and the process will delay if the actual UBO has to come down to Singapore. If I did not declare to the bank that I am the UBO, the process will unlikely to go through. I was just trying to expedite and smoothen the process of opening the bank account and help the establishment of those company in Singapore”.

105    When Tang was confronted by the Prosecution that this similarity could only come about because that was the reason given by Vadim to him, his responses were quite telling:

> Q.    And what you explained at A1 is that you knew the bank needed to know who the UBO was and if they had known you were not the actual owner, they would not have opened the account, that's what you felt, correct?

> A.    That was just what I felt.

> Q.    Yes, that's what you felt, correct?

> A.    Yes, that's how I felt.

> Q.    And Vadim had also told us in court his explanation was also that all of this was to facilitate account opening to help the accounts come into operation sooner, correct?

> A.    Mm-hm.

> Q.    And it is a similar reason to what you've given us, right?

> A.    Right.

> Q.    And you only had this reason in your mind because that's what Vadim had explained to you, correct?

> A.    I mean, I have a lot of conversations with Vadim so there's a possibility it could be just a hearsay that if let's say if I told -- hearsay, lah, that, you know, I mean, it's just the conversations I had with Vadim. It is not that Vadim told me to tell me that to people or whatsoever.

> Q.    Sure. In these conversations with Vadim, he had told you that it is more difficult for foreigners to open bank accounts in Singapore, correct?

> A.    Yes, could be a hearsay, yes.

> Q.    And so you understood from this that if you did not present yourself as the UBO to the banks, the banks would not open the accounts, correct?

> A.    I'm not sure, that could be a possibility, I'm not sure.

> Q. That's a possibility, yes? I put it to you that that was what happened. You understood from Vadim in this way that you were supposed to present yourself as the UBO of the companies and the bank account.

> A.    No, at all times he didn't tell me to tell the banks that I was the UBO or make a false declaration. He didn't tell me to do that at all. And there's no evidence to suggest that he did that as well.[^33]

106    Although, at the end of this exchange, Tang denied that Vadim did tell him to make a false declaration that he was the UBO, he had clearly acknowledged that it was a possibility that whatever he had understood about the banks not opening the account if they knew he was not the UBO could have come from his conversations with Vadim. I found that it was not just a possibility but the truth as clearly Tang’s source of all the information about opening of bank accounts would likely have come from Vadim. Tang during examination in chief clearly stated his dependence on Vadim:

> Q.    You earlier told this court Vadim would advise you on opening or closing accounts. Why were you so willing to trust Vadim when he asked you to open a bank account or to provide certain documents to a bank? Can you tell us about your relationship with him or how you perceived him at that time?

> A.    He was someone I could trust and he was a corporate secretary, so I mean he's a professional at what he does, so obviously he would have done all the necessary -- he would know all the necessary procedures needed for this whole matter, like he would be the one interacting with the clients, he would -- I would put in good faith that he will do the background check of the clients, and then of course the type of business transactions that they do and carry out, and he assured me that whatever I'd done, I mean, like this whole business consultancy thing is legal, it is perfectly legal, I'm not doing anything illegal, because if I'm doing anything illegal, I would not have done it at all.[^34]

107    This finding is reinforced by the fact that Vadim practically coached Tang on how to present himself and answer questions when opening the bank accounts. It is not disputed that Vadim had briefed Tang on what kind of answers to give to the bank officers in relation to the business of the companies, which Tang would have otherwise no inkling of. An example of how Vadim would prepare Tang is as set out here in the cross-examination of Vadim:

> Q.    Turning now to your own bundle of documents, the black bundle, let's look at page 119. Do you have that?

> A.    Yes.

> Q.    This is specifically about Evoque Capital, which, you've told us, is a company that was going to trade in shares and what we can see here is that you actually told Andruew how to answer the bank officer's queries, right?

> A.    Yes.

> Q.    You even gave Andruew some companies in Singapore which deal in shares so that he can have them as a reference as a potential source of shares acquisition, right?

> A.    Yes.

> Q.    That would enable him to answer any questions from the bank officer.

> A.    Yes.

> Q.    That is because Andruew was presenting himself as the owner of a company trading in shares.

> A.    No, I disagree with the last statement. He was presenting himself not as the owner but as the authorised person acting on behalf of the company for the purpose of establishing accounts for this company.

> Q.    The bank account opening forms, as we have seen, don't only talk about authorised persons. They specifically require declarations of ultimate beneficial ownership. You've seen that, correct?

> A.    Yes, I did see that.[^35]

108    Although, in the end, Vadim still denied that he was helping Tang to present himself as the beneficial owner, this denial clearly flew in the face of all that had been presented to the bank by Tang on Vadim’s instructions and provisions:

> (a)     The ACRA documents showing that Tang was the sole shareholder and director of the company;

> (b)     Information about the companies which deal with shares which can be used as a reference as a potential source of shares acquisition for Evoque[^36]; and

> (c)     How to answer questions if asked by bank officers about why only foreign funds accounts have been opened.[^37]

109    It was plainly obvious that the objective of all these was to dress Tang up as the UBO of the company in order to get the bank account to be opened expeditiously by Tang without any delay or hitches.

110    On the whole, I found that there was sufficient evidence that Vadim and Tang had the common object of presenting Tang as the UBO to the banks for the sole objective of ensuring that there will not be any difficulty in getting the bank accounts opened. Pursuant to this common object, Tang had among other things, made the declaration that he was the UBO of the companies or of the bank account to be opened. **Accordingly, I found that the element of conspiracy between Vadim and Tang as set out at \[9(e)\] above has been satisfied**.

#### The adding of names subsequent to the opening of bank accounts to operate internet banking

111    I would like to address one final issue that has been raised by the Defence, particularly by Vadim. This was the fact that subsequent to the opening of the bank accounts, internet banking was applied for by Tang for the three companies and in this regard, the names of the foreign UBOs were added in for this purpose. The Defence thus argued that there was no intent to deceive the banks as otherwise they would not have applied for the foreign UBOs to be inserted. There would have been no point in only opening the account for a short while before it is shut down once the true UBO came into the picture.

112    Defence had also sought to confirm with the bank officers that since the internet banking was approved for these persons, they must have been checked on these names and these persons were cleared by the banks. Accordingly, Defence also made the point that there was no dishonest intention to conceal their identities and no harm was intended to be caused to the banks.

113    The short answer to this argument is that the offence was not premised upon there being any intent on the part of the accused persons to cause harm to the banks. Rather, it was the omission of the banks in failing to consider the true UBO at the time of opening of the bank accounts that was likely to cause harm to the banks. Here, the fact that the alleged UBOs might have been made known to the banks through the insertion of their names subsequently as authorised users for internet banking services did not detract from the fact that they did intend to induce the omission of the banks to check on the true UBO at the material time of the opening of the bank accounts. Whether the banks would allow another person who is not the named UBO to have access to internet banking subsequent to the opening of the bank account is a separate matter. The primary objective of the accused persons which was to get the bank account opened successfully had been achieved through the deception.

## CONCLUSION ON THE ISSUE OF CONVICTION

114    In conclusion, I found that there was sufficient evidence to satisfy the burden of proving each and every element of the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.

115    I accordingly found both accused persons guilty and convicted of the respective charges.

## THE APPEAL AGAINST SENTENCE

### The Prosecution’s submissions

116    The Prosecution submitted that the principle of general deterrence would come to the forefront where offences are committed against financial institutions due to the importance they play in maintaining Singapore as an internationally respected financial hub. As such, offences that affect the delivery of financial services or the integrity of the economic infrastructure warrant general deterrence. Here, the offences had circumvented the banks’ KYC checks, which is an important part of combating money-laundering and other illicit activities and therefore must be sufficiently deterred and punished.

117    The Prosecution also submitted that the offences were hard to detect due to submission of supporting ACRA documents as well as the ability of Tang to answer questions in relation to the operations of the businesses which had been fed to him by Vadim. As such the offences could carry on unabated for over 3 years, which in itself is a further aggravating factor. The Prosecution added further that the enhancement of security measures to prevent such offences from being perpetrated in the future will indubitably increase the burden on banks and consumers alike.

118    The Prosecution thus submitted that the custodial threshold has been crossed. They then highlighted the fact that 2 other persons, who had been recruited by Vadim, had earlier pleaded guilty and were sentenced for their roles.

119    In _Public Prosecutor v Phee Sim Gek_ (DAC-934381-2019 & Ors), the offender pleaded guilty to 2 charges and was sentenced on 26 August 2020 to 5 days’ imprisonment per charge, with 2 charges taken into consideration. The global sentence was 5 days’ imprisonment. In _Public Prosecutor v Seet Mei Siah_ (DAC-934378-2019 & Ors), the offender pleaded guilty and was sentenced on 23 September 2020 to 5 days’ imprisonment on the proceeded charge, with 2 charges taken into consideration.

120    The Prosecution submitted that in the light of Tang claiming trial, there should be an uplift in the sentence and submitted for a sentence of 10 days’ imprisonment with 2 sentences to run consecutively, giving a global sentence of 20 days’ imprisonment. As for Vadim, given his greater culpability, Prosecution submitted for a sentence of 3 weeks’ imprisonment per charge with 2 sentences to run consecutively, giving a total sentence of 6 weeks’ imprisonment.

### The Defence’s submission on mitigation and sentencing

121    Vadim highlighted that he and Tang were not caught red-handed as he had already stopped asking local nominee directors to help open corporate bank accounts on behalf of the client’s companies since early 2017, more than a year prior to CPIB starting their investigations into some potential money-laundering related episodes by some clients.

122    Vadim also submitted that there were no losses or harm caused to anyone, and the fact that there was not a single complaint from the banks evidenced this point.

123    Vadim highlighted that he had in 2017 and 2018 attended various courses to improve his knowledge on regulations and policies. In 2018, he successfully passed a test to become a Registered Filing Agent with ACRA. In October 2019 he had also enrolled in Diploma in Law course and successfully completed it in November 2020.

124    He further claimed that since the dates of the offences, he had reported suspicious transactions and potential misconduct committed by his clients to the authorities.

125    Accordingly, Vadim submitted that he has shown a strong propensity for reform in terms of his positive desire to change as well as the existence of conditions in his life that would be conducive to helping him turn over a new leaf, relying on the case _Public Prosecutor v Siow Kai Yuan Terence_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 82</span>.

126    In the alternative, considering that no harm was caused to the banks and that he had acted in good faith, Vadim submitted that a fine would be sufficient. He highlighted these mitigating factors: his low culpability, his full cooperation with the authorities, his clean record and the fact that he had suffered severe hardship and financial losses as a result of him being prosecuted.

127    Tang gave a similar mitigation in that it was emphasised that no quantifiable loss was suffered by the banks and that none of the offences were committed for financial gains other than a fixed sum in payment for his director’s fees. He pointed out his low culpability and relatively young age of 25 at the material time of the offences.

128    He further claimed that he had already endured tremendous punishment as being a local celebrity, his name was published widely. This has brought him shame as well as cost him some career opportunities.

129    In the circumstances he asked for probation or a low fine of $1000.

### The Accused’s antecedent record

130    Both the accused persons have no record of any previous convictions.

### The reasoning for the sentence

131    It is true that no financial losses were caused to any of the banks. However, this is a case which squarely falls within a category of cases where monetary loss is not a good indicator of the harm caused. As the Honourable Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon held in _Idya Nurhazlyn bte Ahmad Khir v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 1 SLR 756</span> at \[48\], where the offence entails the misuse of a financial instrument or facility which threatens the conduct of legitimate commerce, the need for general deterrence is likely to take centre stage”.

132    The harm caused in the present case is that it undermined the efforts of the banks and MAS to combat money-laundering as well as to prevent the banking facilities from being used to move ill-gotten gains out of the reach of enforcement authorities. It is common knowledge that there have been increasing number of cases where victims have been scammed into remitting monies to a particular bank account and by the time they realised they have been duped, the monies in the account had already been dissipated. In some cases, the funds go through several other bank accounts before they become untraceable. Thus there is a real need for banks to be vigilant and to conduct the necessary searches on the true UBO of bank accounts to reduce the risk of bank accounts and their facilities to be used for illegal purposes unwittingly.

133    Meticulous steps had been taken by both Vadim and Tang, from the incorporation of the companies with Tang as the shareholder to briefing Tang on how to answer questions regarding the companies and of course the declaration of Tang as the UBO to ensure that the bank accounts would be opened smoothly and expeditiously. There was thus planning and premeditation to ensure that no doubts would be raised in the minds of the bank officers that Tang might not be the true UBO contrary to the declaration. These measures taken on the whole had resulted in the offences being carried out undetected for 2-3 years.

134    The principle of sentencing is clearly one of deterrence and the custodial threshold has been crossed. The need for deterrence would eclipse any need for rehabilitation.

135    The principle of parity of sentencing needs to be given some prominence in the present case as well since there were 2 persons in the shoes of Tang who had shown remorse by pleading guilty early to their offences. In the absence of any information to the contrary, it can be assumed that similarly the banks in those cases did not suffer any financial losses and neither were the accounts found to be used to facilitate any wrongdoing. As such I found that their sentence of 5 days’ imprisonment per charge should form the starting indication in the present case for Tang.

136    I did not find anything exceptional mitigating in the personal circumstances of Tang to warrant a more lenient treatment. Accordingly, there should be a higher sentence meted out to Tang to reflect the absence of the mitigating effect of a plea of guilt that would have been invariably accorded to those who have pleaded guilty.

137    I found that both harm and culpability were low in the present case as I accept that Tang did not think he was doing anything illegal and no financial losses were caused. Neither were the banks embroiled in any scandal involving wrongful use of their banking facilities. Accordingly, I am of the view that a small uplift would be sufficient for Tang’s sentence, bearing in mind that at least 2 sentences would have to be ordered to run consecutively by virtue of section 307 of the Criminal Procedure Code, Cap 68. I therefore sentenced Tang to 7 days’ imprisonment per charge with a global sentence of 14 days.

138    As for Vadim, he played the main role in the conspiracy, as the person who stood to gain most from the successful opening of the bank accounts as well as the directing mind in recruiting and briefing Tang on how to get the bank accounts to be opened without any hitches. I have therefore imposed a sentence that is double that of Tang. I would have imposed a longer sentence had I taken into account the total number of charges faced by Vadim. However, those charges had been stood down since Vadim had indicated that he wished to continue to contest those charges.

139    Accordingly, I imposed a sentence of 2 weeks’ imprisonment on Vadim with 2 sentences to run consecutively, giving a global sentence of 4 weeks’ imprisonment.

## CONCLUSION

140    Both accused persons have till the very end emphasised that they did not believe what they did to be wrong or illegal. Instead, they believed that they were merely providing a service to clients of MEA to help facilitate their expansion plans through Singapore.

141    Unfortunately, they had crossed the line in the method that was employed in order to achieve their ends. What they did had greatly undermined the safeguards put in place by the banks to combat a serious and real threat of money-laundering and other nefarious activities. Even though they claimed that the businesses of these clients are legitimate, the reality is that they have not personally conducted any due diligence checks on them nor were they in a position to do so. Vadim could only rely on the representations made by another agent Confideri or by the clients directly, and Tang in turn could only rely on Vadim’s assurances.

142    Based on the overall criminality and the fact that no serious harm has in fact been caused, short sentences of imprisonment had been imposed on both of them, with Vadim receiving the longer sentences given his more prominent role in the conspiracy.
