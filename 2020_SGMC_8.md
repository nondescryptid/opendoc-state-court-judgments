### District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt:

## Introduction

1       The accused, a 58 year-old male Singaporean, was driving his lorry along Pasir Ris Drive 3 when he encountered a recreational pedal cyclist (“cyclist”) who was blocking his path. The accused tried unsuccessfully to overtake the cyclist. The cyclist finally allowed the accused to overtake him. However, just as the accused was driving past, the cyclist mischievously reached out and broke the accused’s side mirror. In retaliation, the accused veered sharply into the path of the cyclist causing the cyclist to run off the road and fall off his bicycle. The cyclist was injured and his bicycle was damaged. A verbal altercation ensued between them and the cyclist called the police. The accused drove off before the arrival of the police and did not report the accident within 24 hours thereof.

2       The accused claimed trial to two charges respectively for (i) an offence under s 337(a) of the Penal Code for causing hurt to the cyclist by rash driving which endangered his life (**first charge**), and (ii) an offence of failing to report the accident within 24 hours under s 84(2) read with s 84(7) and punishable under s 131(2) of the Road Traffic Act (“RTA”)(**second charge**). He was convicted of both charges and sentenced to seven weeks’ imprisonment and disqualified from driving all classes of vehicles for two years in respect of the first charge, and fined $500 in respect of the second charge.

3       He appealed against his conviction and sentence and is presently on bail pending the outcome of the appeal. The fine and disqualification order have also been stayed.

## Charges

4       For ease of reference, the two charges against the accused are reproduced as follows:

> First Charge

> You…are charged that you, on 22 December 2018 at about 11.57 am, along Pasir Ris Drive 3 towards New Loyang Link near Lamp-post 80, Singapore, driving motor lorry GBD4011Y, did cause hurt to a pedal cyclist Cheung Eric Hoyu, male aged 35 years old, by doing an act so rashly as to endanger human life, to wit, by suddenly swerving the motor lorry to your left and colliding into the said cyclist, causing him to fall off his bicycle and onto a grass verge on the left side of the road, and you have therefore committed an offence punishable under Section 337(a) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

> Second Charge

> You…are charged that you, being the driver of the motor lorry GBD4011Y, where an accident owing to the presence of that motor lorry occurred on 22 December 2018 at about 11.53 am along Pasir Ris Drive 3 towards New Loyang Link near Lamp-post 80, Singapore, which accident resulted in injury to a pedal cyclist, Cheung Eric Hoyu, male aged 35 years old, failed to report the accident at a police station or to a police officer within 24 hours after the accident, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 84(2) read with section 84(7) and punishable under section 131(2) of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276.

## The Prosecution’s Case and Evidence

5       The prosecution’s case was grounded mainly on the oral testimonies of the cyclist (a 35 year-old British national) and the following eye-witnesses at the scene:

> (i)     PW2 Yvonne Lim Yi Wen (“Yvonne”) who was driving in front of the cyclist at the material time;

> (ii)     PW3 Ong Joo Kim (“Ong”) who was driving his taxi next to the accused at the material time; and

> (iii)     PW4 Nigel William Harper (“Nigel”) who was cycling with the cyclist.

The prosecution also relied on the video footage that was retrieved from the in-car camera in Yvonne’s car.[^1] I will set out the salient facts as provided in the summary of the prosecution’s case in its closing submission.[^2]

6       In respect of the first charge for rash driving, the prosecution alleged that the accused deliberately swerved into the cyclist’s path because the cyclist had broken the accused’s side mirror. The cyclist admitted that he had broken the accused’s side mirror. It was not in dispute that he was also blocking the accused. The cyclist was prosecuted for:

> (i)     a charge under r 29 of the Road Traffic Rules (R 20, 1999 Rev Ed) for riding in the middle of the lane and obstructing faster moving vehicles and;

> (ii)     a charge under s 426 of the Penal Code for breaking the accused’s side mirror.

By the time the cyclist took the stand as a prosecution witness, he had already pleaded guilty to both his charges and was fined $2,800 in total.[^3]

7       In respect of the second charge for non-reporting, the prosecution alleged that the accused knew that he had collided with the cyclist, which collision resulted in the injuries to the cyclist and damage to his bicycle. The accused did not provide his particulars to the cyclist and drove off. Further, he did not make a police report within 24 hours of the accident.

### Events leading up to the collision

8       On the day and time in question, the accused was driving a Toyota Dyna 150 lorry along Pasir Ris Drive 3 towards New Loyang Link. He was driving on the inner lane of two lanes. By inner lane, I am referring to the lane next to the kerb as opposed to the outer lane which would be the lane next to the centre-divider. The accused drove up behind the cyclist who was cycling abreast of Nigel, who was closer to the kerb. The accused found himself being blocked by the cyclist. The accused tried to overtake the cyclist by “inching out”[^4]i.e. encroaching into the outer lane.[^5] He was unable to overtake the cyclist because there were cars on the outer lane.[^6]

9       The cyclist then came to a stop at a red-light. The accused stopped behind the cyclist but crept forward incrementally until he was very close to the cyclist.[^7] This made the cyclist very uncomfortable.[^8] The video footage also showed that the cyclist looked over his shoulder a few times. The cyclist was keenly aware that the accused’s lorry was inching closer to him.

10     Both the cyclist and the accused moved off after the lights turned green. The accused again tried to overtake the cyclist by encroaching onto the lane divider between the two lanes.[^9] Ong, who was driving his taxi on the outer lane and abreast of the accused, sounded his horn once to warn the accused not to encroach into his path.[^10] Ong also applied his brakes when he sounded his horn.[^11] Yvonne, who driving about three car lengths ahead of the cyclist, also heard a single horn sound.[^12] Nigel, who was cycling with the cyclist, did not recall hearing any horn.[^13]

11     When Ong sounded his horn, the prosecution pointed out in the video footage that the bonnet of Ong’s taxi was seen to dip downwards. This was due to the braking force when Ong applied the taxi’s brakes at about the same instance when he sounded the warning horn at the accused. At that juncture (i.e. 12 second mark), it was the prosecution’s case (and this is the nub of contention) that the accused continued to drive on the lane divider for about 3 to 4 seconds until he swerved to his left at the 15 second mark.[^14] In other words, the accused ignored and did not react immediately to Ong’s sounding of the horn. The accused did not cross into the outer lane as he had done earlier before the junction and there was no contact between the accused’s lorry and Ong’s taxi.

12     At about this moment, the cyclist finally relented and moved closer to the kerb to allow the accused to pass. Nigel cycled ahead of the cyclist. The accused drove up alongside the cyclist and, according to the cyclist, was less than one arm’s length away.[^15] The accused’s windows were wound down.[^16] As the accused’s lorry was driving past, the cyclist reached out and struck the lorry’s side mirror causing part of it to break off.[^17] This act of damaging the side mirror formed the subject-matter of the charge of mischief against the cyclist to which he eventually pleaded guilty.

13     It was the prosecution’s case that the accused retaliated by immediately swerving sharply to his left into the path of the cyclist, at a 45-degree angle,[^18] thereby colliding with Eric. The accused’s lorry came into contact with the cyclist’s body and caused him to fall onto the grass verge on the left.[^19] The cyclist testified that there was contact which caused him to fall off. His shoes were clipped onto the pedals and therefore, he could not simply have jumped off his bicycle had there been no contact with the lorry.[^20] Nigel also heard the cyclist exclaim contemporaneously that he had been knocked off his bicycle.[^21] Yvonne also testified that she saw the cyclist breaking the side mirror and that the accused swerved immediately and was quite fast. She also confirmed that the lorry had collided with the bicycle.

14     The following stills extracted from the Yvonne’s in-car camera footage showed that there was contact between the lorry and the cyclist:[^22]

![]([2020] SGMC 0008_Image/[2020] SGMC 0008_image2.png)

### The altercation

15     Thereafter, the accused alighted from his lorry and berated the cyclist for damaging his side mirror. He was not at all concerned if he had caused injuries to the cyclist or had damaged his bicycle.[^23] The accused was angry that his side mirror was damaged.[^24] The accused also claimed that he had called the police.[^25] A photograph of the accused at the scene showing him to be visibly agitated was admitted as evidence.[^26] The cyclist also testified that the accused pointed his mobile phone at him saying that he was recording a video. The cyclist then snatched the phone from the accused but returned it to the accused.[^27]

16     The accused then got into his lorry and drove off without providing his particulars to the cyclist. The accused lodged a report with a police officer on 24 December 2018 at 4.41 pm,[^28] more than 24 hours after the collision. He did so only after the police managed to track him down and advised him to do so.

### Injuries and damage

17     The ambulance arrived shortly and the paramedics attended to the cyclist. The cyclist sustained erythema (redness) on his left elbow and left knee as well as abrasions on the left knee.[^29] The injuries were consistent with the cyclist falling onto the grass verge.[^30] After the paramedics attended to the cyclist, the cyclist and Nigel left the scene before the police arrived.

18     The cyclist subsequently sought medical treatment at the Accident and Emergency Department at Parkway East Hospital the following day on 23 December 2018. He was seen by Dr Tan Seow Hwee (“Dr Tan”).[^31] The cyclist presented with a history that he was hit on the right side by a lorry and he fell onto his left side.[^32] Dr Tan diagnosed the cyclist to have suffered tenderness of the left arm and left elbow and pain on abduction and external rotation of the left arm. Dr Tan confirmed that the injuries were consistent with the patient’s history.[^33]

19     The medical report in respect of the cyclist’s injuries was admitted in evidence.[^34] The findings, treatment and management, and diagnosis are summarised as follows:

> (i)     There was no head injury as he was wearing a helmet;

> (ii)     Tenderness in left arm (humeral head) and left elbow;

> (iii)     Painful when abducting or externally rotating left arm;

> (iv)     Range of movement in left elbow was normal;

> (v)     X-rays show no fracture;

> (vi)     The cyclist was treated as an outpatient with oral painkiller and advised to rest arm in sling;

> (vii)     He was reviewed in three weeks with complaint of lower back pain but x-ray was normal;

> (viii)    Treated as an outpatient again and given additional painkiller;

> (ix)     Final diagnosis of sprain and strain of the lumbar spine and left shoulder girdle.

20     An inspection of the cyclist’s bicycle revealed cracks on the handlebar and left rear portion.[^35] The bicycle could not be repaired as it was too dangerous to ride. The original cost of the bicycle was $7,000.[^36]

## Close of Prosecution’s Case

21     At the close of the prosecution’s case, counsel for the defence did not make any submission of no case to answer.

22     I found that there was prima facie evidence to support the elements of both charges at the close of the prosecution’s case and I called on the accused to give his defence to the said charges.

## The Defence

23     The accused elected to give evidence. He was the only witness for the defence. The accused’s defence is stated in detail in counsel’s submission.[^37] I propose to set out a summary encompassing the essential points of the defence.

24     In respect of the first charge, the accused’s defence was that he was trying to overtake the cyclist when Ong sounded the taxi’s horn to warn the accused. The accused then heard a “crashing sound” which was the sound of the cyclist striking his side mirror. The accused mistook that sound to be the sound of his lorry coming into contact with Ong’s taxi. The thrust of the accused’s defence was that he instinctively steered away from the taxi towards the cyclist because he thought he had collided with the taxi.

25     The accused also disputed that there was contact between his lorry and the cyclist because there was no damage to the side of his lorry. He further disputed that the cyclist had sustained injuries. The accused added, for good measure, that the cyclist was aggressive and had scolded the accused.

26     The defence accepted that the accused may have been negligent but that he did not drive rashly. He denied swerving into the cyclist out of anger. On the other hand, counsel was at pains to demonise the cyclist due to his inconsiderate road-hogging. The cyclist was the author of his own misfortune because he had lost his balance when he struck the accused’s side mirror.

27     As regards the second charge of non-reporting, the accused’s defence was that after the cyclist had finally calmed down, the accused decided to drive off firmly believing that the cyclist was uninjured. He did not see the need to provide his particulars because he simply assumed the cyclist (or Nigel) would have recorded his licence plate number.[^38] In any event, he had difficulty communicating with the cyclist who spoke in English.

## The Court’s Findings and Decision

### The law

28     In respect of the first charge for rash driving, s 337(a) of the Penal Code provides as follows:

> **_Causing hurt by an act which endangers life or the personal safety of others_**

> _Whoever causes hurt to any person by doing any act so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life or the personal safety of others, shall be punished —_

>> (_a_)     _in the case of a rash act, with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine which may extend to $5,000, or with both;_

29     I accepted prosecution’s submission that an advertence to the potential risks would generally suffice to satisfy the element of rashness (_PP v Hue An Li_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 661</span> (“_Hue An Li_”) at \[45\]).[^39] On the facts of this case, it was not in dispute that the accused had swerved left suddenly into the path of the cyclist. Therefore, if he had done so deliberately with the awareness that there was a real and not merely theoretical or fanciful risk that he might cause hurt to the cyclist, he would have done so rashly. There is no necessity to prove that he knew that he would in all likelihood cause hurt (_Hue An Li_ at \[65\]).

30     I further accepted that the question whether the accused had the requisite _mens rea_ would invariably be a matter of inference to be drawn by the court from the surrounding circumstances (_Tan Joo Cheng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1992\] 1 SLR(R) 219</span> at \[12\]). If he did in fact deliberately swerve into the path of the cyclist under the circumstances, the inference of an awareness of the risks of danger to the cyclist by such a dangerous manoeuvre, must readily and invariably be inferred.

31     I would also not disagree with the various definitions of “rashness” as relied upon by the defence counsel i.e. hazarding a dangerous or wanton act with the knowledge that it is so, and that it may cause injury (_Empress of India v Idu Beg_ (1881) ILR 3 All 776 at 780); a disregard to the possibility of injury or death (_Lim Hong Eng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 3 SLR(R) 682</span>); a heedlessness or indifference as to risk (_Jali bin Mohd Yunos v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGCA 50</span>).[^40] In summary, a person acts rashless if he is aware of the risks but does the act anyway not caring about the consequences at all.

32     The defence also relied on the definition as decided in _Re Nidamarti Nagabhushanam_ (1872) 7 MHC 119 at 120 that rashness means acting with the consciousness that the mischievous and illegal consequences may follow, but with the hope that they do not, and often with the belief that the actor has taken sufficient precaution to prevent their happening.[^41] This appears to be a more benign or somewhat lower threshold of rashness. In other words, if there was no belief that precautions had been taken or sincere desire that injuries not be caused, the rashness would be even more readily inferred. In any case, as I have explained below, I did find that the accused had driven rashly whichever threshold definition was adopted.

33     As for the second charge for non-reporting, I also accepted prosecution’s submission that the duty under s 84(2) of the RTA arises the moment the accused realises an accident had taken place (_Fernandez Joseph Ferdinent v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 3 SLR(R) 65</span> at \[22\]).[^42] There is no added requirement of knowledge that injury or damage was caused.

### Accused deliberately swerved into the cyclist

34     I rejected the accused’s claim that he thought he had knocked into Ong’s taxi when he heard the “crashing sound” of his side mirror being damaged by the cyclist. I found this claim to be entirely illogical and untenable and therefore beggared belief. There was no dispute that the cyclist was on the left of the accused’s lorry and that Ong’s taxi was on the accused’s right. The accused’s claim was illogical simply because the sound of Ong’s taxi horn would have come from the accused’s right and the sound of the side mirror breaking would have come from his left. Therefore, as a matter of logic and common-sense, he could not have mistaken the sound of his left mirror breaking to be caused by his lorry coming into contact with Ong’s taxi on his right. Conversely, if he heard the “crashing sound” from his left and mistook that as the sound of a collision, he would have instinctively swerved away from the sound i.e. to his right. Instead, he swerved to his left. Either scenario was untenable and defied logic.

35     Further, as astutely and rightly pointed out by the prosecution, the in-car camera footage clearly showed that after Ong had sounded his taxi horn (which coincided with Ong braking and causing the bonnet of his taxi to visibly dip downwards), the accused did not react immediately but continued to drive in a straight line for at least 3 seconds before the cyclist struck and broke his side mirror. There was no contact with Ong’s taxi during this 3-4 second duration. In other words, there was no immediate or instinctive swerving of his lorry when Ong sounded his horn. In effect, the accused ignored Ong’s warning horn and continued to drive on the lane divider trying to overtake the cyclist. I agreed with prosecution’s submission that the accused knew he was in no danger of colliding with Ong’s taxi which accounted for why he ignored the horn and continued to drive on the lane divider for at least 3 seconds.[^43] He was in fact trying to overtake the cyclist who had, by then, decided not to block him anymore.

36     He only swerved his lorry to his left into the path of the cyclist in an immediate reaction to the cyclist breaking his side mirror. This assessment is borne out by Yvonne’s observation who made the connection of the breaking of the side mirror with the accused’s sudden swerving of his lorry into the path of the cyclist. I found that the accused heard the sound of the breaking mirror and that he knew that the cyclist had damaged his side mirror. He could and would have seen the cyclist doing so. I found that that was the only reason why he swerved in the direction of the cyclist. I found that he did so deliberately in retaliation of the cyclist striking and breaking his side mirror. I found that his driving into the cyclist’s path was dangerous and had clearly endangered the life of the cyclist. The accused knew and appreciated the risks of causing serious or even fatal injuries to the cyclist but he chose to disregard those risks because he was blinded by rage. I found that the accused was in fact trying to run the cyclist off the road and in the process, knocked him off his bicycle causing injuries to the cyclist and damage to his bicycle. Given the circumstances and his intention, I found that the accused was clearly rash, regardless of which threshold definition of that term (as discussed above) is to be applied. This was clearly not the case where the accused had taken calculated risks in the hope that the cyclist would not be injured, or that he had taken precautions to mitigate those risks. He was trying to run the cyclist off the road and he did not care if the cyclist would be injured or not.

37     I further agreed with the prosecution’s analysis that the _speed and manner_ of the accused’s manoeuvre showed that he had deliberately swerved into the cyclist. He did not react to Ong sounding the horn but yet swiftly and surely steered his lorry sharply at 45 degrees to his left when the cyclist struck his side mirror. As seen from the in-car camera footage, the accused’s lorry traversed obliguely across the entire width of the lane and stopped short of mounting the left kerb thereby effectively running the cyclist off the road completely. There was no question that it was a deliberate and wicked act. It was simply tit-for-tat.

38     I accepted that the cyclist was inconsiderate initially by riding in the middle of the lane thus blocking the accused. Be that as it may, I agreed with the prosecution that the manner in which the accused was trying desperately to overtake the cyclist showed that he was as impatient as the cyclist was inconsiderate. He drove onto the lane divider and, at times, also encroached into the outer lane in his repeated attempts to overtake the cyclist. He was being a nuisance to other drivers as well and he also showed his impatience at Yvonne in the beginning (when she was driving behind and was blocked by the cyclist) by horning at her thinking she was driving too slowly.[^44] After Yvonne managed to overtake the cyclist, the accused then showed his impatience with the cyclist and sounded his horn at the cylist.[^45] He was plainly frustrated at being blocked by the cyclist and was unable to overtake him despite trying very hard to do so. He resorted to menacingly inching very close to the cyclist when they were all stopped at the red lights.[^46] Given the build up of the accused’s frustration, I found that when the cyclist broke the accused’s side mirror, it was also the proverbial straw that broke the camel’s back. The accused retaliated in typical road rage fashion by running the cyclist off the road and then getting into a verbal altercation with the cyclist.

39     I further found that the accused was not a credible or truthful witness. He claimed that he was unable to tell where the sound of the breaking mirror had come from.[^47] I rejected this claim because the windows of his lorry were wound down and he would have clearly heard and known the direction of the sound of the breaking side mirror. His claim was also problematic because if he was unable to tell where the sound had come from, it would not explain why he would choose to swerve left instead of right. I found that the accused’s claim was inherently incredible and inconsistent with the evidence.

40     In conclusion, I found that the accused deliberately swerved into the path of the cyclist in retaliation for the cyclist breaking his side mirror. When he steered into the path of the cyclist, he collided with him and caused him to fall onto the grass verge injuring him and damaging his bicycle. I rejected the defence’s argument that there was no contact with the cyclist for reason that there was no damage to the side of the lorry. I would imagine and I found that the contact between the lorry and the flesh of the cyclist would not likely have caused any damage to the lorry. I agreed with the prosecution that the _mens rea_ requirement in the first charge was proved because there was more than mere advertence of the risk of harm in the accused’s mind.

### Accused did not report within the required time-frame

41     The accused knew that he had gotten into a traffic accident with the cyclist.[^48] There was no denying and it was not in dispute that the accused did not report the accident within 24 hours. There was also no denying and I found that the accused knew that he had knocked the cyclist off his bicycle onto the grass verge. There was further no denying and I found that the cyclist was injured and that his bicycle was damaged. There was clearly no settlement or amicable parting of ways between the cyclist and the accused. They argued and berated one another and the accused simply drove off. He did not provide his particulars and did not offer to exchange particulars with the cyclist. Whether or not the cyclist would have recorded the licence plate number of the lorry was beside the point. The accused did not ensure that the cyclist had recorded down his license plate number. I found that he drove off quickly to avoid the police because he knew he was in the wrong. I found that he had no justification or valid reason to drive off before the police arrived.

42     I rejected the accused’s claim that he did not provide his particulars because the cyclist did not have his NRIC on him. This was a feeble excuse. There was nothing to stop the accused from exchanging particulars with the cylist. In any case, his excuse was irrelevant to the charge of failing to lodge a police report. Even if the exchange of particulars was not possible or practical, I agreed with prosecution’s submission that it is precisely under such circumstances that the duty to report to the police becomes most relevant.

43     I also rejected the accused’s other reasons for not reporting i.e. that he thought that the cyclist was not injured and he assumed that he was free to leave.[^49] However, I found that the cyclist was visibly injured and that his bicycle was damaged. Further, the accused’s side mirror was damaged. There was no agreement that parties would not pursue to claim from each other. Far from it, they were arguing when the accused decided to flee before the police arrived and did not report the accident thereafter within the time-frame mandated by law. I found that the accused has no valid defence to the charge of non-reporting.

### Conclusion - Verdict

44     I found that the accused had deliberately veered sharply into the path of the cyclist with the intention to run him off the road. In so doing, he collided with the cyclist and knocked him off his bicycle onto the grass verge causing injuries to the cyclist and damage to his bicycle. I found that he had driven rashly in a manner which endangered the life of the cyclist. I rejected the accused’s defence that it was an instinctive reaction to avoid what he thought was a collision with the taxi on his right. I found that the accused was not a credible witness and his explanations defied logic and common-sense.

45     I rejected the accused’s reasons and excuses for driving off the accident scene without exchanging particulars with the cyclist or waiting for the arrival of the police. He had no valid reason for not reporting the accident within 24 hours thereafter either. I therefore found that the accused had no valid defence to the second charge of non-reporting.

46     In conclusion, I was satisfied and I found that the prosecution has proved its case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt in respect of both charges. Accordingly, the accused was convicted on both charges.

## The Sentence

### The sentences imposed

47     The accused was sentenced in respect of both charges as follows:

48     The prescribed punishment for the second charge of non-reporting is either a fine up to $1,000 or imprisonment up to 3 months. The prosecution did not make any submission for any specific sentence in respect of this charge.[^50] The defence asked that only a fine of $500 be imposed and that no order of disqualification be made.[^51] I imposed a fine for this charge as requested by counsel.

49     Even though the accused has appealed against his sentence, however, since the sentence of a fine that was imposed on the second charge was exactly what counsel had asked for, I would think that the accused’s appeal against sentence was restricted to and directed only at the first charge for rash driving. Therefore, my reasons for sentence will be confined to the said charge.

### Custodial term

50     There was no question in my judgment that the offence committed by the accused in respect of the first charge was sufficiently serious to warrant a deterrent jail term. It has been often stressed that a deterrent sentence need not always take the form of a custodial term (_Goik Soon Guan v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 31</span> at \[21\]). In this case however, both the prosecution and the defence were in agreement that a custodial sentence was warranted. They disagree only as to the length of the jail term and the period of the disqualification order to be imposed.

51     In assessing the seriousness of an offence (which would be a natural proxy to measure the appropriate term of imprisonment), the High Court in _Lim Ying Ying Luciana v PP and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 1220</span> at \[28\] stated that the two principal parameters which a sentencing court would generally have regard to in evaluating the seriousness of a crime are: (a) the harm caused by the offence; and (b) the accused’s culpability, and that “harm” is a measure of the injury which has been caused to society by the commission of the offence, whereas “culpability” is a measure of the degree of relative blameworthiness disclosed by an offender’s actions and is measured chiefly in relation to the extent and manner of the offender’s involvement in the criminal act.

52     On the present facts, whilst the harm caused was low to moderate (moderate on account of the high value of the bicycle), the accused’s culpability was moderately high to high for the reasons and due to the aggravating circumstances as elaborated hereon.

### Prosecution’s sentencing submission

53     The prescribed punishment for the first charge of rash driving is imprisonment up to one year, or fine up to $5,000, or both. In other words, the court has the discretion to sentence the accused to either a fine or a jail term or a combination of both punishments.

54     In addition, s 42 of the RTA empowers the court to order a period of disqualification as follows:

> Disqualification for offences

> 42.-(1)    A court before which a person is convicted of any offence in connection with the driving of a motor vehicle may, in any case except where otherwise expressly provided by this Act and shall, where so required by this Act, order him to be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for life or for such period as the court may think fit.

55     The prosecution pressed for a deterrent sentence of at least 10 weeks’ imprisonment plus three years’ disqualification be imposed on the accused.[^52]

56     The prosecution described this case as one of road rage which culminated in the accused “_using his motor lorry to ram a pedal cyclist off the road_.”[^53] The prosecution submitted that the accused had used his lorry (with unladen weight of 1,800 kg) as a potentially lethal ‘weapon’.[^54] The prosecution further pointed out the gross mismatch in the dimensions between the accused’s lorry and the cyclist’s bicycle thus underscoring the high potential for serious injuries that may be caused to the cyclist. The prosecution also called out the accused’s manner of driving leading up to the offence, including his lack of lane discipline and also driving perilously close to the cyclist, as causing a danger to other road users. Apart from the description that the accused had rammed the cyclist (to which I will address shortly), I agreed with all these aggravating circumstances as outlined by the prosecution.

#### Prosecution’s precedents

57     The prosecution also tendered a list of cases involving incidents of road rage. The prosecution highlighted several precedents where custodial sentences of between five weeks to nine months were imposed on offenders who had “_used their vehicles as weapons_” but had caused little or no injuries to the victim. These were strictly not cases of offences under s 337(a) Penal Code but nonetheless involved somewhat similar circumstances of road rage. The offences in these cases ranged from rash driving under s 279 Penal Code (where the accused deliberately rammed the victim’s car by swerving right causing the victim’s car to be lifted off the road surface and skidding right which in turn caused other vehicles to take evasive action, and in another case, where the accused drove against traffic flow and straight at the victim three times as the victim was trying to walk out of a petrol kiosk), dangerous driving under s 64 RTA (involving an offender chasing after and ramming the victim’s car) and causing mischief under s 427 Penal Code (where the accused accelerated and collided into the rear of the victim’s vehicle three times).

58     The prosecution’s point was that even though most of these precedents involve arguably less serious offences (in terms of the maximum prescribed punishments), custodial sentences as long as nine months were imposed on those offenders.

59     In particular, the prosecution submitted that the appropriate sentence ought to lie between the sentences imposed in the cases of _PP v Lim Kok Tiong_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGDC 186</span> (“_Lim Kok Tiong_”) and _PP v Sim En De_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 200</span> (“_Sim En De_”). In both cases, the offender pleaded guilty to a lesser offence of rash driving under s 279 Penal Code. In _Lim Kok Tiong_, the offender tried to ram a victim who was trying to step out of a petrol kiosk. The offender did not succeed in hitting his target (unlike the present case) but he was very persistent and had made three attempts to do so. He was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment and disqualified from driving for three years. The prosecution acknowledged that the present case was not as egregious as _Lim Kok Tiong_.

60     In comparison, the offender in _Sim En De_ deliberately rammed the rear of the victim’s motor car. The prosecution contended that whilst there was a greater potential for harm, this factor had to be balanced against the factor that that victim was in the more protected confines of his car as opposed to being more vulnerable riding a bicycle as in the present case. The offender in _Sim En De_ was sentenced to eight weeks’ imprisonment and disqualified from driving for four years. The prosecution submitted that an appropriate sentence for the present accused ought to lie between the respective sentences imposed in these two cases i.e. 10 weeks’ imprisonment.[^55]

61     The prosecution also pointed out, quite rightly, that this was a case of road rage and that deterrent sentences are usually axiomatic to punish road bullies. The deterrent sentencing policy underlying road rage cases was reiterated in _PP v Lim Yee Hua_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1106</span> at \[29\] that road users must exercise self-restraint, de-escalate conflict and amicably resolve their differences when a conflict arises from the shared use of the roads. Otherwise, they will be subject to deterrent sentences.

62     The prosecution also highlighted the accused’s poor driving record. The accused’s conduct was in keeping with his antecedent record. Apart from numerous parking-related offences, the accused was traced for two counts of careless driving, one count of failing to give way to an approaching vehicle, one count of speeding (exceeding the limit by 31 to 40kph) and one count of beating a red light.[^56] I was of the view that the accused’s bad driving record was entirely consistent with the accused’s aggressive and dangerous driving in this case. Considering the number and nature of his prior traffic violations, I agreed that a sufficiently lengthy period of disqualification was justified to underscore the seriousness of the present offence and to specifically deter the accused from future dangerous driving.

### Appropriate length of custodial sentence

63     Ultimately, I fully agreed with the prosecution that the custodial threshold has been crossed. As I have noted earlier, counsel for the accused did not disagree on this important point.

64     However, I took the view that the prosecution (in asking for 10 weeks’ imprisonment and three years’ disqualification) had not given sufficient consideration to the admittedly deliberate and provocative acts of the cyclist in first blocking the accused then mischievously and vindictively striking and damaging the victim’s side mirror, albeit that the accused's reaction thereafter was disproportionate. In fact, the prosecution had argued that no mitigating weight should be accorded on account of the cyclist’s provocation.[^57] I also took the view that it was incorrect for the prosecution to assert that the accused had used his car as a weapon to ram the cyclist. I would not pitch the accused’s culpability that high. More accurately, I found that he deliberately swerved into the path of the cyclist in an attempt to run him off the road. That was the full extent of his intention and actions. Therefore, given the cyclist’s initial anti-social and deliberately provocative acts which were directed at the accused, and considering that the prosecution may have painted a far more egregious picture of the accused’s act of swerving his lorry, I was prepared to shave about 30% off the sentence that the prosecution had sought.

### Defence’s sentencing submission

65     Counsel for the accused pleaded for a shorter jail sentence of no more than two weeks and a disqualification order of no more than six months to be imposed.[^58] In seeking for a shorter jail sentence, counsel was therefore in agreement with the prosecution that the custodial threshold has been crossed in respect of the first charge.

#### Defence’s precedents

66     Counsel referred to a list of sentencing precedents concerning motor-vehicle related offences under s 337(a) Penal Code.[^59] Many of these were common with the list of precedents cited by the prosecution.

67     Counsel also proposed a harm/culpability matrix when considering the appropriate sentence[^60]but submitted that the harm was slight and the culpability was low on the facts of the present case.[^61] I did not agree with counsel’s assessment that the accused’s culpability was low as that assessment was premised on an absence of aggravating features that are seen in the precedents, such as speeding, drink-driving, sleepy driving, driving while using a mobile phone, flouting traffic rules, driving against the flow of traffic or off the road, involvement in a car chase, or exhibiting poor control.[^62] The list of aggravating features cited by counsel was far from exhaustive. There were indeed other aggravating features present in this case as I have already outlined above. I must stress that cases of rash driving and road rage are very much fact-specific and I was mindful of the High Court’s emphasis in _Chong Yee Ka v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 47</span> at \[80\] that no two cases are wholly similar, and sentencing norms, benchmarks and even case precedents do not necessarily always provide a clear guide in sentencing of cases which are highly fact-specific.

68     Counsel’s additional submission that the accused did not commit any act of violence on the cyclist was also fallacious and misconceived.[^63] The act of deliberately trying to run the cyclist off the road is tantamount to an act of violence.

69     Counsel further argued that the accused ought to be sentenced on the basis that his rash driving had endangered “the personal safety of others” rather than “human life”. It was therefore accepted that the latter formulation was more culpable. Counsel argued that the cyclist’s life was not in danger. I rejected this suggestion because (i) the charge as framed makes reference to endangering of human life and not merely the personal safety of others, and (ii) I found as a fact that the accused, in swerving into the path of the cyclist and running him off the road, did endanger his life.

#### Personal circumstances

70     In mitigation, counsel canvassed the personal circumstances of the accused for the court’s consideration.[^64] Briefly, the accused licensed a swamp on Pulau Ubin and tried many years to convert it into a fish farm but failed. He did odd jobs to earn a living with the use of his lorry. However, in view of this case, his lorry was impounded for a few months which affected his livelihood.

71     The accused is supporting a 20 year-old daughter who is a student and a 22-year old son who is autistic and unemployed.

72     It is trite law that personal circumstances which are not sufficiently exceptional cannot be given any mitigating weight (_Lai Oei Mui Jenny v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] 2 SLR(R) 406</span> at \[11\]–\[12\] and _PP v Perumal s/o Suppiah_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 2 SLR(R) 145</span> at \[23\]). Suffice to say that I did not find any of the accused’s personal circumstances to be compelling or exceptional to merit any material reduction of his sentence. The personal circumstances also had no bearing on the accused’s culpability in the offence.

#### Lack of remorse

73     Counsel also submitted that the accused had cooperated fully with police investigations. Counsel informed that the accused only decided to contest the charge because it was amended from a charge for negligent driving to the present charge for rash driving. The accused was prepared to plead guilty to the original charge for negligent driving.

74     I did not think much of counsel’s plea that the accused had cooperated fully with police investigations. This claim surely flew in the face of my finding of fact that the accused had driven off from the accident scene even before the ambulance or the police arrived, and his failure to report the accident thereafter until he was tracked down by the police. He provided a statement to the police. That appeared to be the sum of his “full cooperation” with investigations. He was and continues to be unremorseful by denying his guilt and pursuing this appeal.

75     I further considered that the accused had contested the charge and therefore would forfeit any sentencing discount that may have been given to him. The accused has shown no remorse and has refused, even now in pursuing this appeal, to admit and take responsibility for his wrongdoing. I did not consider, as mitigating, counsel’s plea that the accused would have pleaded guilty to the original lesser charge of negligent driving. That option was not available to him. The fact remained that the version of the facts which he was relying on to support a lesser charge of negligent driving was ultimately rejected by this court. Therefore, there was no basis to assert that he was prepared to plead guilty to a lesser charge. His willingness to do so was entirely irrelevant.

### Conclusion - Sentence

76     I considered the sentencing submissions from both sides (including the mitigation plea) and came to the conclusion that the custody threshold has been crossed.

77     Having weighed and balanced the accused’s mitigation plea against the sentencing factors as outlined above, and having regard to the all facts and circumstances of this case, the accused was sentenced (in respect of the first charge) to 7 weeks’ imprisonment and disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving license for a period of 2 years with effect from the date of his release from prison.

78     I was of the view that the length of imprisonment and period of disqualification imposed were justified, appropriate and proportionate given the vindictiveness and culpability of the accused and the circumstances of the injuries and damage caused in this case.
