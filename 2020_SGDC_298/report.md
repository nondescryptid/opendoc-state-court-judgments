Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing

Road Traffic – Offences – Dangerous driving causing hurt

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9873/2020/01.\]

4 January 2021

### District Judge Lorraine Ho:

## Introduction

1       The accused, a 62-year-old Singaporean male, was charged with an offence of dangerous driving causing grievous hurt under s 64(1) and punishable under s 64(2A)(a) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) (“RTA”).

2       On 27 January 2020 at about 9.04pm, the accused failed to conform to the traffic red right-turn arrow signal when he travelled across the junction of Newton Road by Moulmein Road and Thomson Road in his motorcar no. SMM9072K (“the accused’s motorcar”). The accused was travelling on the third lane of four lanes from the right along Moulmein Road towards the direction of Newton Road. It was a going straight only lane. He stopped his motorcar when the traffic light turned red.

3       When the traffic light turned green, the accused, instead of proceeding straight towards Newton Road, decided to make a right turn towards Thomson Road. This resulted in a collision with motorcycle no. FBJ7841S (“the victim’s motorcycle”), which was proceeding straight from the opposite direction.

4       At that material time, the traffic light was showing green in favour of the victim with the red right-turn arrow against the accused. The impact from the collision resulted in largely frontal damage to the victim’s motorcycle and left side rear damage to the accused’s motorcar. The victim was also injured.

5       On condition of plea, the Prosecution agreed to proceed with a reduced charge of dangerous driving causing hurt punishable under s 64(2B)(a) of the RTA instead.

6       On 10 November 2020, the accused accepted the Prosecution’s offer and pleaded guilty before me to the reduced charge for dangerous driving causing hurt. Accordingly, the accused was thereafter sentenced as follows:

7       On 12 November 2020, the accused filed a Notice of Appeal because he was dissatisfied with the sentence imposed on him.

8       The accused has since paid the fine in full and did not apply for a stay of the disqualification order pending the appeal.

## Background facts

### The Charge

9       The proceeded dangerous driving charge reads as follows:

>     You, are charged that on the 27th day of January 2020 at or around 9.04 p.m., along junction of Newton Road by Moulmein Road by Thomson Road, Singapore, did drive a motor vehicle, SMM9072K, in a manner which was dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the nature, condition and use of the road, and the amount of traffic which was actually at the time, or which might reasonably be expected to be, on the road, to wit, by failing to conform to traffic red right turn arrow light signal when making a right turn at the junction of Newton Road by Moulmein Road by Thomson Road and thus resulted in a collision with a motorcycle, FBJ7841S, which was travelling straight from your opposite direction, and hurt was caused to one, motorcycle rider, Oh Guen Kien, Alwin, Male, 40 years old, Chinese. By such driving, you have thereby committed an offence under Section 64(1) punishable under Section 64(2B)(a) of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276.

### Statement of facts

10     The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) dated 29 June 2020 without qualification. A concise, succinct and edited version of the SOF depicting the offence of the dangerous driving charge reads as follows:

>     …

>      **Facts of Case**

> 4    On the 27th day of January 2020, at or about 9.04 p.m., the defendant did drive Singapore registered motor car, SMM9072K, along the junction of Newton Road by Moulmein Road by Thomson Road, Singapore, in a manner which was dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the nature, condition and use of the road, and the amount of traffic which was actually at the time, or which might reasonably be expected to be, on the road, to wit, by failing to conform to traffic red right turn arrow light signal when making a right turn at the junction of Newton Road by Moulmein Road by Thomson Road and thus resulted in a collision with a motorcycle, FBJ7841S, which was travelling straight from the opposite direction, and resulting in the victim, one motorcycle rider, Oh Guen Kien, Alwin to collide into the left rear side of the defendant’s motor car and hurt was caused to the victim by such driving.

>      **Evidence/Witness**

> 5    The front footage from the defendant’s motor car showed the defendant’s motor car (**SMM9072K**) was travelling on lane 3 of 4-lane road along said location with the lane marking of the said lane showing “straight only”. Upon the traffic light turned to green light in the defendant’s favour, the defendant proceeded forward to cross the said junction. However, upon crossing the said junction, the defendant proceeded to make the right turn even though the traffic light was showing right turning arrow in red light. As the defendant was turning right, the defendant narrowly missed an oncoming unknown motor car that was coming onto his path from his left to right direction, however the victim who was on the left side of the unknown motor car came onto the defendant’s path from his left to right direction and thus causing a collision between the victim and the defendant.

> 6    Additionally, the rear footage from the defendant’s motor car revealed that the traffic on both lane 1 and lane 2 of 4 lanes did not move off due to the red right turn arrow when the defendant had moved off.

>      **Injuries**

> 7    As a result of the accident, the victim was conveyed conscious to Tan Tock Seng Hospital and was discharged on the next day on the 28th day of January 2020. The victim sustained a closed comminuted fracture of his right distal radius. The victim received 7 days of hospitalisation leave from the hospital.

>      **Condition of motorcycle, FBJ7841S**

> 8    The front handle portion of the motorcycle was broken and not functional. The front bottom portion was dented, front mudguard had cracks and the front fender portion was also scratched and cracked. The left portion of the rear motorcycle box also sustained scratches.

>      **Condition of motor car, SMM9072K**

> 9    There were scratches and dents on the left rear portion and scratches on the left rear rim of the motor car, SMM9072K.

>      **Prevailing Conditions**

> 10    It was established that at the time of offence, the weather was fine, the road surface was dry, the visibility was fair and the traffic flow was moderate. There were no mechanical fault claims for both the motorcycle, FBJ7841S, and the motor car, SMM9072K, prior to the accident.

12     Relevant screenshots taken from the video footages of the accused’s front and rear view in-vehicle cameras regarding the accident are as follows:

![]([2020] SGDC 0298_Image/[2020] SGDC 0298_image2.png)

## Antecedents

13     The accused was untraced in terms of traffic convictions. He had two compounded speeding offences on 11 January 1995 and 7 September 2014 respectively.

14     The accused confirmed his antecedents to be correct.

## Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

15     The Prosecution orally submitted for a fine of $9,000 and a disqualification from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences (“DQAC”) for a period of 3 years.

16     The Prosecution highlighted that in terms of culpability for dangerous driving, it was on the higher end of the low range. The accused had not only beaten the red right-turn arrow at the traffic light junction but also went against the traffic directional sign by making a right turn on a going straight only lane.

17     In terms of the harm caused, this was serious. There was property damage caused to the victim’s motorcycle. The cost of damage for the motorcycle was not available in this case. Based on the vehicle damage report of the motorcycle, the front portion of the motorcycle sustained dents, cracks and scratches. The handlebar was broken and not functional.

18     The victim also suffered injuries as described in the victim’s medical report from Tan Tock Seng Hospital. The victim sustained a right wrist fracture, was hospitalised and given seven days of hospitalisation leave.

19     There was also potential harm caused to another motorist where the accused had narrowly missed a motorcar before colliding with the victim’s motorcycle travelling on the lane next to the motorcar.

20     As the accused has pleaded guilty to the reduced charge under s 64(2B)(a) of the RTA, the Prosecution submitted that the custodial threshold was not crossed in the present case.

21     However, given the extent of harm caused as well as the manner in which the accident occurred, the Prosecution submitted that the fine amount here should be nearer to the maximum fine of $10,000 prescribed under s 64(2B)(a) of the RTA. This would also take into account the legislative intention where the prescribed maximum fine has since doubled from $5,000 under the previous s 64(1) of the RTA (“pre-2019 s 64(1) RTA”) to the current $10,000 since the RTA amendments which came into force on 1 November 2019.

22     As for the disqualification (“DQ”) order of 3 years, the Prosecution similarly submitted that there should be a doubling of the DQ period from 18 months to 3 years bearing in mind a heightened need for deterrence as compared to the past.

23     The Prosecution referred to _PP v Koh Thiam Huat_ \[2017\] 4 SLR 1009 (“_Koh Thiam Huat_”), which was decided based on the even earlier s 64(1) of the RTA prior to 20 June 2017 (“pre-2017 s 64(1) RTA”) where the prescribed maximum fine was $3,000. The prescribed maximum imprisonment term remained the same at 12 months for both the pre-2017 s 64(1) RTA and pre-2019 s 64(1) RTA.

24     In _Koh Thiam Huat_, the accident happened when the accused had failed to conform to the traffic red light signal and the victim was injured, which was similar to how the accident happened in the present case. The High Court imposed a DQ order of 18 months in _Koh Thiam Huat_.

25     Nonetheless, in coming to its submissions on sentence, the Prosecution informed me that, unlike in _Koh Thiam Huat_, it did not consider or rely on the accused’s previous compounded traffic offences. This was despite the fact that pursuant to s 139AA of the amended RTA, for the purpose of determining the appropriate sentence, a court may take into account any offence that has been compounded (whether before, on or after the date of commencement of the amended RTA on 1 November 2019) as an aggravating factor.

26     Ironically, the Prosecution acknowledged that the accused in _Koh Thiam Huat was_ traced for previous traffic convictions and did not have a good driving record.

## Mitigation

27     The accused tendered his own written mitigation. He submitted a sentence for a fine of between $4,000 to $6,000 and a DQAC of between 18 to 24 months to be imposed.

28     Given his submissions on sentence, I can only assume that he was only dissatisfied with the quantum of the fine eventually imposed on him as I had accepted his submission on the duration of the DQ order to be imposed.

29     In mitigation, the accused was contrite and truly sorry for the unfortunate accident. He accepted responsibility by pleading guilty at the earliest available opportunity. He was grateful to the Prosecution for agreeing to reduce the charge from s 64(2A)(a) to s 64(2B)(a) of the RTA.

30     After the accident, he rendered assistance to the victim until the arrival of the police and ambulance at the scene. He was apologetic to the victim for the injury suffered by the victim. The accused cooperated fully with the police throughout the investigations.

31     At the material time, the accused was working as a private-hire driver. He is a divorcee and works to support his youngest daughter, whom he has care and custody of. She is still studying in secondary school. As he is not highly educated and comes from a humble background, it would not be easy for him to seek alternative employment that does not require him to drive.

32     At regards to sentence, the accused was of the view that his culpability was high as he failed to adhere to the traffic red light signal. The weather was clear, road surface was dry, traffic flow was light and visibility was good. The accused admitted that it was an error of judgment on his part.

33     In terms of the harm caused, the accused submitted it was medium based on the injury suffered by the victim.

34     Moreover, he had a good driving record. This was a one-off aberration that would never be repeated.

35     Although he is a layman, the accused referred me to several cases which were decided under the two previous s 64(1) provisions of the RTA for consideration. For the pre-2019 s 64(1) RTA, the accused cited three cases.

36     The first was _Neo Chuan Sheng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 97</span> (_“Neo Chuan Sheng”_), where it was held by the High Court at \[19\] – \[20\]:

> \[19\]  ln deciding on the appropriate period of disqualification, it must first be borne in mind that the disqualification order and the fine imposed are not mutually compensatory; an increase in the quantum of the fine imposed should not be taken to mandate the imposition of a reduced period of disqualification than would otherwise have been ordered: _Edwin Nathan_ at \[13\]. The fact that the fine imposed in this case was close to the maximum provided for under s 64(1) RTA was therefore not a reason to reduce the period of disqualification.

> \[20\]  Next, it is clear that the period of disqualification should increase in tandem with the severity of the offence: Edwin Nathan at \[14\].

37     The accused in _Neo Chuan Sheng_ was imposed a fine of $4,500 and a DQAC of 10 months when no injury was caused.

38     The second case was _PP v Fong Sun Yong_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 74</span> (_“Fong Sun Yong”_). The accused in this case was fined $3000.00 and given a DQAC of 10 months.

39     The third was _PP v Lim Bock Seng_ (unreported: Case No. |SC-904506-2019; MAC-905712/2019), the accused collided his car into a pedestrian and was initially charged under s 388(b) of the PC for causing grievous hurt. The charge was eventually reduced to dangerous driving and the accused was fined $5000 and banned from driving for 12 months.

40     The accused further cited two cases under the pre-20 June 2017 s 64(1) of the RTA. The first was _PP v Michael Wong Yew Wah_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGDC 73</span> ("_Michael Wong_”). The accused in that case had collided into a pedestrian at a signalised crossing when he was executing a right turn in his taxi. The victim sustained a closed displaced fracture of lateral tibial plateau of the left knee and abrasion of her left knee, which were serious injuries. The accused claimed trial. There, the accused was sentenced to a fine of $2,400 and a DQ order of six months.

41     ln _PP v Ong Kan Keng_ (unreported 12 Nov 2018: Case no: 171019159411) (_“Ong Kan Keng”_), the accused beat the red light and collided head-on with a motorcyclist, resulting in very severe injuries to the motorcyclist. The accused was fined $3,000 and given a DQ order of 18 months.

42     The accused cited one case under s 338(b) of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (“PC”) for causing grievous due to a negligent act. ln _PP v Cheang Chin Kong_ (unreported: Case No. SC-911038/2015; MAC 908109/2015) (_“Cheang Chin Kong”_). The victim in this case suffered grievous hurt, which was in the accused’s view, more serious than that suffered by the victim in his case. The accused in _Cheang Chin Kong_ was fined $5000 and given a DQ order of one year.

43     Relying on the above cases, the accused made three points. First, there was no mandatory minimum DQ period set by Parliament under s 64(2B)(a) unlike s 64(2)(a) or s 64(2A)(a) of the RTA. Therefore, the court maintains the discretion under s 42(1) of the RTA when imposing the duration of the DQ order like the pre-2017 s 64(1) RTA and pre-2019 s 64(1) RTA.

44     Next, as a comparison with the other cases cited by him, given that the injury caused to the victim in this case was not severe, the accused was of the view that the fine imposed on him should be in the middle range between $4,000 and $6,000 and the appropriate DQ period should be between 18 to 24 months.

45     Finally, by extrapolating from the cases cited by him, the proposed sentence for a fine of $4,000 to $6,000 and DQ order of between 18 to 24 months would, in his view, be fair. This was already an uplift in the calibration of sentence in light of the recent amendments made to the new s 64(2B)(a) of the RTA.

## Decision on Sentence

### Section 64(1) of the RTA for causing hurt

46     Since 1 November 2019, s 64(1) and punishable under s 64(2B)(a) of the RTA for what is commonly known as dangerous driving causing hurt states:

>     Reckless or dangerous driving

> 64.—(1)    If any person drives a motor vehicle on a road recklessly, or at a speed or in a manner which is dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the nature, condition and use of the road, and the amount of traffic which is actually at the time, or which might reasonably be expected to be, on the road, the person (called the offender) shall be guilty of an offence.

> (2B)  If hurt is caused to another person by the driving of a motor vehicle by the offender, the offender shall on conviction of an offence under subsection (1) —

>> (a)    be liable to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both;

47     The definition of harm for causing “grievous hurt” is imported from the Penal Code. Pursuant to s64(8) of the RTA, the definition of “grievous hurt” in both s64 and s65 of the RTA has the same meaning as in section 320 (except paragraph (aa)) of the PC. “Hurt” is defined under s319 of the PC to mean:

>     Whoever causes bodily pain, disease or infirmity to any person is said to cause hurt.

48     For the disqualification period, there is no prescribed mandatory minimum DQ period under s 64(2D) for an offender sentenced under s 64(2B)(a) of the RTA. Thus s 42(1) of the RTA remains the applicable provision when imposing a DQ order and it states:

>     Disqualification for offence

> 42.— (1)    A court before which a person is convicted of any offence in connection with the driving of a motor vehicle may, in any case except where otherwise expressly provided by this Act and shall, where so required by this Act, order him to be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for life or for such period as the court may think fit.

49     In relation to the rationale for the amendments to the RTA which came into force on 1 November 2019, in my decision in _PP v Cullen Richard Alexander_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 88</span> (“_Cullen_”) at \[70\] – \[75\], I had set out generally Parliament’s intention to enhance criminal penalties for road traffic offences so as to provide a stronger deterrence against irresponsible driving to make our roads safer. The enhanced criminal penalties include introducing higher minimum mandatory sentences (including disqualification periods) to keep irresponsible motorists off the roads for a longer period as well as higher maximum sentences as compared to the existing penalties under the PC or the RTA (prior to the new amendments).

50     Another reason for the amendments is to consolidate driving offences previously prosecuted under the PC, like rash and negligent acts, under the RTA. This will enable the offences to be streamlined under the RTA into (i) Reckless or Dangerous Driving under s 64 of the RTA; and (ii) Driving without Due Care or Reasonable Consideration (also known as “inconsiderate driving”) under s 65 of the RTA.

51     Besides the manner of driving or circumstances in which the traffic offence is committed, the level of harm caused by the offender is also considered in the overall approach. The four levels of harm are (i) Death; (ii) Grievous hurt; (iii) Hurt; and (iv) Endangering life. Therefore, the greater the harm caused, the level of punishment will be higher.

52     In the past, the prescribed punishments for inconsiderate and dangerous driving were not specifically calibrated based on the degree of harm caused by the offender.

53     The overall enhanced approach envisaged under the new RTA now encompasses the harm and culpability sentencing factors (i.e. culpability of the offender versus the harm caused by him to others), which the courts have traditionally considered in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed on an offender.

54     In terms of the maximum prescribed punishment, this has holistically increased. For example, the maximum punishment for a first offender in the past for inconsiderate driving was a fine not exceeding $1,000 or an imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both. Now, the maximum fine for inconsiderate driving where no hurt is caused to any person has increased to $1,500 for a first offender. The maximum imprisonment term remains the same at 6 months.

55     For dangerous driving, the maximum punishment for a first offender in the past under the pre-2019 s 64(1) RTA was a fine not exceeding $5,000 or an imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both. This prescribed punishment remains the same under the new s 64(2C)(a) of the RTA where no hurt is caused.

56     However, the maximum fine for dangerous driving where hurt is caused to any person has since increased to $10,000 for a first offender. The maximum imprisonment term is similarly doubled and increased to 2 years.

57     A comparison of the respective punishment provisions for causing hurt from rash or negligent acts under the PC and those under the new RTA amendments for inconsiderate and dangerous driving reveal that the maximum sentencing penalties are generally higher under the new RTA:

58     As such, when referring to past cases involving dangerous driving under the old provisions of the RTA or even cases under 338(b) of the PC for causing grievous hurt by a negligent act cases (where the maximum prescribed punishment is a fine up to $5,000 or with imprisonment up to 2 years or with both), one must be mindful of the enhancement in the various penalties intended by Parliament for dangerous driving particularly when injury results.

### Sentencing framework for dangerous driving causing hurt

59     For the offence of causing hurt by dangerous driving, the two principal factual elements in the determination of the severity of this offence are:

> (a)     The level of culpability of the offender in his act of dangerous or reckless driving; and

> (b)     The degree of hurt caused by the offender due to his act of dangerous driving.

60     In the seminal decision of _Koh Thiam Huat_, which was a case that involved a dangerous driving offence under the pre-2017 s 64(1) RTA as cited by the Prosecution, it was set out by the High Court that when evaluating the seriousness of a crime by a sentencing court, these two principal parameters of an offender’s culpability and harm caused by the offence are applicable to a traffic offence. See Kee Oon J held at \[41\]:

>      _“Harm” is a measure of the injury which has been caused to society by the commission of the offence, whereas “culpability” is a measure of the degree of blameworthiness disclosed by an offender’s actions and is measured chiefly in relation to the extent and manner of the offender’s involvement in the criminal act._ \[emphasis added\]

61     Even though _Koh Thiam Huat_ was decided under the pre-2017 s 64(1) RTA, it was held at \[20\] of _Neo Chuan Sheng_, which was decided under the pre-2019 s 64(1) RTA, that _Koh Thiam Huat_ still provides useful guidance in evaluating the severity of an offence under s 64(1) of the RTA.

#### Level of culpability

62     In terms of the distinction in culpability between dangerous driving and inconsiderate driving, reference can be drawn from legislative intention. In the Second Reading of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2019 \[Bill No. 13/2019\] in Parliament on 8 July 2019, the Second Minister for Home Affairs, Mrs Josephine Teo said:

>     Dangerous Driving is more serious than Careless Driving. The two can be differentiated on a case-by-case basis. The three main considerations, among others, are as follows.

>     First, whether the _manner of driving_ predictably puts other road users at risk and cause other road users to be unable to react in time. Examples of driving that are considered as dangerous, as opposed to careless, include serving across lanes suddenly and without warning, driving against the flow of traffic and speeding.

>     Second, whether the _motorist had driven even though he should have known he was not in a condition to drive safely_. Examples of behaviour that are considered dangerous include using mobile devices while driving and failing to use visual aids such as spectacles even though he is seriously short-sighted.

>     Third, whether the _road situation required the motorist to take extra care but he did not_. Examples include when he is approaching a zebra crossing, or a junction where other road users have the right of way.

>     When determining the punishment, we will look at the circumstances under which the offence is committed. The _threshold for Dangerous Driving is higher than Careless Driving; so too the penalties_. \[emphasis added\]

63     As such, the threshold for dangerous driving in terms of culpability is higher than for inconsiderate driving. This also correlates with the higher penalties involved for dangerous driving. Factors which the courts can consider are the manner of driving, the condition of the motorist as well as the road situations at the material time.

64     Aggravating factors like speeding, drink driving, sleepy driving and deliberate dangerous driving behaviour can increase an offender’s culpability in terms of the manner of dangerous driving. In _Koh Thiam Huat_, See Kee Oon J held at \[41\]:

>     The factors increasing the accused’s culpability would include a particularly dangerous manner of driving. As illustrations, the aggravating factors identified in Hue An Li, i.e., speeding, drink-driving and sleepy driving, would clearly contribute to this, as would driving while using a mobile phone. In addition, _if the dangerous driving was deliberate (for instance, in “hell riding” cases), this would also indicate a higher level of culpability_. \[emphasis added\]

65     In _PP v Aw Tai Hock_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 1141</span> (“_Aw Tai Hock”)_, which was similarly a case decided based on pre-2017 s 64(1) RTA, it was enunciated by the High Court at \[37\] that the factors which affect culpability for dangerous driving offences would generally include (a) the manner of driving; (b) the circumstances of driving; and (c) the offender’s reasons for driving.

66     In terms of the manner of driving, Steven Chong JA highlighted at \[38\] that this assesses how dangerous the driving was and the extent of danger to road users posed by the offender’s conduct. Examples of situations where the culpability of the offender would be increased include speeding, drink-driving, sleepy driving, driving whilst using a mobile phone, flouting of traffic rules, driving against the flow of traffic or off the road, involvement in a car chase, or exhibiting poor control of one’s vehicle.

67     As for the circumstances of driving, the circumstances surrounding the incident that may have increased the danger to road users during the incident must also be taken into account. They would include instances where the offender drives:

> (a)     during rush hours and when volume of traffic is heavy;

> (b)     within a residential or school zone;

> (c)     a heavy vehicle that is more difficult to control and requires a quicker reaction time; or

> (d)     a substantial distance to reach his destination or intends to do so: See \[39\].

68     As for the reasons or motivations for driving that can increase the culpability of an offender, Chong JA said at \[40\] that such situations included deliberate acts of driving in a dangerous manner as compared to a genuine emergency or other extenuating circumstances.

69     In _Tang Ling Lee v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 18</span> (_“Tang Ling Lee”)_, the accused had pleaded guilty to causing grievous hurt by a negligent act under s 388(b) of the PC. See J cited _Aw Tai Hock_ and elaborated at \[28\] - \[29\] on the manner and circumstances of driving which can heighten the danger posed to other road users and thereby increase the culpability of an offender:

> \[28\]  …In relation to the manner of driving, some examples of situations where culpability would be increased include speeding, drink driving, sleepy driving, driving while under the influence of drugs, driving while using a mobile phone, flouting traffic rules, driving against the flow of traffic or off the road, involvement in a car chase or a racing competition or exhibiting poor control of his vehicle.

> \[29\]  Second, the circumstances surrounding the incident should also be taken into account. This would include instances where the offender drives without a licence or while under disqualification. In _Suse Nathen_ (at \[28\]), it was considered that there may be increased risk where the offender drives: (a) during rush hours when the volume of traffic is heavy; (b) within a residential or school zone; (c) a heavy vehicle that is more difficult to control and requires a quicker reaction time; or (d) where he intends to travel a substantial distance to reach his destination. These circumstances may heighten the danger posed to road users.

#### Degree of harm

70     As held at \[41\] of _Koh Thiam Huat_, in terms of “harm” or the degree of hurt caused, this can include any potential harm that might have been caused to other road users or pedestrians as an important factor for the courts’ consideration when it comes to dangerous driving behaviour.

>      _In the context of the offence of dangerous driving under s 64(1) of the RTA, the primary factor relating to the harm caused would be the extent of injury or damage caused._ A related and equally important consideration would be the potential harm that might have resulted, given that driving is an inherently dangerous activity that can pose serious risk to road users and pedestrians alike. \[emphasis added\]

71     As causing “hurt” includes causing bodily pain, disease or infirmity, this will also involve the extent of any injury or damage caused to a victim by the offender. There is a lesser degree of harm caused from hurt than for grievous hurt which will involve at least a fracture or dislocation of a bone: See s 64(8) of the RTA, where the definition of “grievous hurt” in both s 64 and s 65 of the RTA has the same meaning as in section 320 (except paragraph (aa)) of the PC.

72     As for any potential harm caused, in _Neo Chuan Sheng_, it was held at \[22\]:

>     The level of potential harm would be assessed against facts which would include (among other things) _the condition of the road, the volume of traffic or number of pedestrians actually on or which might reasonably be expected to be on the road at the relevant time, the speed and manner of driving, visibility at the relevant time, the type of vehicle, and any particular vulnerabilities (e.g., a truck or car colliding into a motorcycle or pedestrian)._There would not be any potential harm to other vehicles or pedestrians if there were no other vehicles or pedestrians that were on or that might reasonably have been expected to be on the road at the relevant time. The volume of traffic and number of pedestrians might also be so minimal that the potential harm can only be assessed to be low, even if serious damage or injury could be caused if that unlikely possibility were realised. \[emphasis added\]

73     Aside from these two principal parameters of culpability and harm, the court should also have regard to other mitigating and aggravating factors which do not directly relate to the commission of the offence per se. They could include the accused’s driving record as well as his remorse or lack thereof: at \[41\] of _Koh Thiam Huat_.

74     Finally, it has been affirmed in both _Koh Thiam Huat_ (at \[60\]) and _Aw Tai Hock_ (at \[28\]) that the primary sentencing consideration for dangerous driving offences are those of specific and general deterrence.

### The appropriate sentence to impose

75     I now come to my reasons for the sentence I imposed on the accused in the circumstances of the present case.

#### Culpability of the accused

76     For the level of culpability of the accused, based on the proposed sentencing framework, I was of the view that this was at the lower end of moderate.

77     The accused had not only beaten the traffic red light signal. He had failed to form up his motorcar correctly into the appropriate lane for vehicles intending to turn right as indicated by the directional arrows on the lanes when he approached the traffic light junction. This was in violation of r 7 of the Road Traffic Rules (Cap 276, R 20) (“RTR”), which reads:

>      **Positioning of vehicle before making a turn at road intersection or junction**

> 7.    The driver or rider of a vehicle who intends to turn to the right at an intersection or junction of roads shall, before reaching such intersection or junction and as opportunity offers, move into the appropriate lane as indicated by the directional arrows to turn right and any driver or rider of a vehicle intending to turn to the left shall, as opportunity offers, move into the appropriate lane as indicated by the directional arrows to turn left.

78     Had the accused form up his motorcar in the correct lanes (i.e. 1st and 2nd lanes), he might not have beaten the red light. This was because the right-turn arrow would have remained at red and vehicles which were intending to turn right on the 1st and 2nd lane would in all likelihood have remained stationary. He would not have wrongly followed the vehicle in front of him by moving off on green light for vehicles proceeding straight only. The probability of error of judgment on his part would have been reduced or obviated.

79     It is dangerous for any vehicle to attempt making a turn at a junction on the wrong lane as other motorists travelling across the junction may not anticipate this unexpected manoeuvre. This is all the more so when the traffic light signal is not favourable for making the turn.

#### Harm caused by the offence

80     As for the actual harm caused to the victim as a result of the accident, I was in agreement with the accused that this was in the degree of medium.

81     In the medical report of the victim by Tan Tock Seng Hospital dated 4 March 2020, physical examination revealed that there was a painful deformity over the victim’s right wrist. There was a bruise over the tip of his right big toe. An x-ray done on the victim’s right wrist confirmed the diagnosis of a comminuted displaced fracture of the right distal radius with intra-articular extension.

82     Fortunately, the victim only needed to undergo conservative and non-invasive treatment for his right wrist fracture by way of manipulation and closed reduction as well as a plaster cast being applied to his forearm. He was discharged the following day on 28 January 2020 and given 7 days of hospitalisation leave.

83     Had the victim been required to undergo invasive treatment like surgical procedures with a longer duration of hospitalisation and hospitalisation leave, I would have then agreed with the Prosecution that the degree of harm caused was serious. Moreover, there was no evidence of any permanent impairment suffered by the victim due to the right wrist fracture and the fracture was located at a less vulnerable part of the body.

84     In addition, it was pertinent to note from the video footage that there was a fair amount of traffic flow at the traffic light junction during that time of the evening. The accused’s motorcar had narrowly missed hitting into another motorcar approaching from the opposite direction before colliding with the victim’s motorcycle. Otherwise, the harm caused could also have been dire.

#### Mitigating factors

85     I gave due consideration to the accused’s remorsefulness and his early plea of guilt. I further noted that he had cooperated fully with investigations and rendered all necessary assistance to the victim.

#### The accused’s driving record

86     Since 1 November 2019, for the purpose of determining the appropriate sentence, a court may take into account any offence that has been compounded (whether before, on or after the date of commencement of the amended RTA on 1 November 2019) as an aggravating factor. The new s 139AA of the RTA states:

>     For the purpose of determining the appropriate sentence for an offence committed by a person under this Act, a court may take into account, as an aggravating factor, any offence that has been compounded (whether before, on or after the date of commencement of section 21 of the Road Traffic (Amendment Act 2019) under this Act before the date of the sentencing.

87     I accepted the Prosecution’s position that the accused had, prior to the present offence, a relatively clean driving record after many years of driving. I did not place any weight on his two previous compounded speeding offences as I accepted that they were rather dated. As a secondary and minor point, the accused’s manner of dangerous driving behaviour for the present scenario was dissimilar in the sense that it was not caused or contributed by an act of speeding.

#### The fine and disqualification order imposed

88     In terms of the principle for identifying the applicable sentencing range for dangerous driving, it remains apposite to make reference to \[42\] of _Koh Thiam Huat_ even though this was decided under the pre-2017 s 64(1) RTA:

>     \[G\]iven the range of sentences prescribed by s 64(1) of the RTA, I would agree that a fine would suffice where there is a low level of harm caused by the offence (or none at all) and the accused’s culpability is also low (substantially the Prosecution’s first submission (see \[40\] above)). On the other hand, imprisonment would be warranted where there is a high level of harm caused by the offence and the accused’s culpability is also high (substantially the District Judge’s approach (see \[40\] above)). Situated between these two obvious extremes are myriad cases of varying levels of harm and culpability, and it would not be fruitful to attempt to lay down too fine a rule. It suffices to state that the role of a sentencing court is to appreciate the facts in each case and properly situate the case before it along the continuum of severity, having regard to both the level of _harm_ and the accused’s _culpability_, as well as the applicable _mitigating and aggravating factors_. \[emphasis in original\]

89     Hence, where both the offender’s culpability and the harm caused are low, custodial threshold is generally not crossed. The converse is true when both the offender’s culpability and the harm caused are high. Where there is lack of aggravating factors, I would add that the custodial threshold is typically not crossed where the level of culpability is between low to moderate and the degree of harm is between low to medium.

90     In the present case, given that the accused’s culpability was, in my view, at the lower end of moderate and the hurt caused was medium, all things considered, I agreed with both the Prosecution and the accused that the custodial threshold had not been crossed in the present case.

91     At the same time, given the level of culpability and degree of harm here, I was of the view that the fine amount to be imposed should be on the higher spectrum of the sentencing range.

92     As for the appropriate fine to be imposed, given that the maximum prescribed punishment for the new s 64(2B)(a) of the RTA is double that of the pre-2019 s 64(1) RTA (where the maximum prescribed punishment was a fine of $5,000 or an imprisonment term of 12 months or both), it would still be informative to refer to cases decided under the old provision as a reference point.

93     It would however not be constructive to refer to cases from the pre-2017 s 64(1) RTA (where the maximum prescribed punishment was a fine of $3,000 or with imprisonment not exceeded 12 months or both) given the disparate maximum prescribed fine range between the two.

94     As submitted by the accused, it was held by the High Court in _Neo Chuan Sheng_ at \[19\] – \[20\] that generally, the DQ period should increase in tandem with the severity of the offence and while the DQ order and the fine imposed are not mutually compensatory, an increase in the quantum of the fine imposed should not be taken to mandate the imposition of a reduced period of DQ than would otherwise have been order.

95     Furthermore, as highlighted by Chua Lee Ming J at \[50\], the older pre-20 June 2017 cases were of limited assistance even if the RTA amendments did not affect DQ orders under s 42(1) of the RTA like s 64(2B)(a) of the RTA in the present case:

>     In my view, both of these cases were of limited assistance because they were decided before the maximum fine for s 64(1) RTA offences had been increased with effect from 20 June 2017. Although the RTA amendment did not affect disqualification orders under s 42(1) RTA, _Parliament’s intent to deter offences of dangerous driving is reflected by the increase in the maximum fine that can be imposed for such offences. This heightened need for deterrence means that the court should take a tougher stance in respect of disqualification orders as well. As the DJ noted (GD, at \[33\]), there has been a concomitant increase in the length of the disqualification orders imposed for offences committed after that date_. \[emphasis added\]

96     Therefore, the increase in the maximum fine that can be imposed for dangerous driving reveals the intention of Parliament to have a heightened need for deterrence. Corollary, the courts should take a tougher stance in respect of DQ orders.

97     Following from there, older cases like _Michael Wong_ and _Ong Kan Keng_ cited by the accused were of limited assistance here.

98     Indeed, the DQ period ordered by the courts have generally increased with the increase in the maximum fine from $3,000 to $5,000 for dangerous driving since 20 June 2017.

99     Generally, since 20 June 2017 and before the recent amendments on 1 November 2019, where the manner of dangerous driving involves the beating of the red light, depending on the harm caused and any other mitigating or aggravating factors, the fine range for cases where fines were imposed for PG cases was anecdotally between $3,500 to $4,500. The range of the DQ order typically ranged between 9 months to 12 months.

100    Examples of reported decisions are _PP v Cheah Yean King Winnie_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 177</span>, where a fine of $4,000 and DQ order of 12 months was imposed in view of the low to moderate culpability of the accused and low degree of harm caused, and _PP v Azahar Bin Mohamed Nor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 185</span> where a fine of $4,500 and DQ order of 12 months was imposed in view of the medium culpability of the accused and moderate degree of harm caused.

101    In _Neo Chuan Sheng_, the accused was sentenced to a fine of $4,500 and a DQ order of 10 months for dangerous driving by reserving 203m to evade a roadblock even though no actual harm was caused. It was held by the High Court at \[51\] that where the level of harm was at the higher end of low and the level of culpability was medium, the appropriate indicative starting DQ period under the previous s 64(1) of the RTA was seven months and the 12-month threshold would generally not be crossed unless the levels of both harm and culpability are at least medium. At \[47\], Chua J said:

>     \[H\]owever, it _appeared that disqualification orders of at least 12 months were generally made in cases in which the levels of both harm and culpability were at least medium_. In a number of these cases, the level of either harm or culpability was high. Insofar as precedents go, these cases show that _the 12-month threshold would generally not be crossed unless the levels of both harm and culpability are at least medium_. However, these cases should not be taken to mean that every case involving medium harm and medium culpability invariably warrants a disqualification order of at least 12 months. Each case must be considered on its own facts, especially given the myriad cases between the two extremes on the spectrum. \[emphasis added\]

102    If the sentencing range for both the quantum of the fine as well as the DQ period in respect of the new s 64(2B)(a) of the RTA is now increased by twofold, taking guidance from _Neo Chuang Sheng_, the appropriate indicative starting DQ period may now be 14 months for a low harm and medium culpability scenario.

103    Following from there, where an accident is caused due to beating of the traffic red light signal and the culpability of the offender is between low to moderate and harm caused by way of hurt is similarly between low to moderate range, as a matter of reference point, the general fine range for such a case under the new s 64(2B)(a) of the RTA for PG cases is likely to be between $7,000 to $9,000 and the DQ period between 18 to 24 months.

104    A search conducted in the Sentencing Information and Research Repository (“SIR”) on cases decided under s 64(2B)(a) of the RTA between 1 November 2019 to 7 September 2020 revealed that six cases were decided thus far. They were all PG cases. The details are as follows:

105    I have also looked at the cases cited by the accused. In _Fong Sun Yong_, the accused claimed trial to the offence of dangerous driving (where the maximum fine was $5,000) for changing lanes suddenly, thereby resulting in a accident with the victim who was riding a motorcycle at the material time. As a result of the accident, the victim suffered from a right ankle avulsion fracture with left abdominal wall abrasion as well as a vertical fracture of the tip of the terminal phalanx of his third finger. They were all conservatively treated. Harm was held to be serious with the accused’s culpability being low. The accused, who was sentenced to a fine of $3,000 and DQAC of 10 months, eventually did not proceed with his appeal on both conviction and sentence.

106    In my view, the accused’s culpability in _Fong Sun Yong_, was lower than the accused in the present case even though the harm caused was somewhat similar.

107    In _Lim Bock Seng_, the accused made a right turn from the main road into a carpark. As he was doing so, he collided into the victim, who was crossing the small road in front of the carpark gantry. The victim sustained lacerations over his right medial ankle and right medial knee, fractures of the right distal tibia medial malleolus and right proximal tibia and right proximal fibula. He had to undergo several surgeries. He pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of dangerous driving and was sentenced to a maximum fine of $5,000 with a DQAC of 12 months.

108    I would say that the culpability of the accused in _Lim Bock Seng_ was lower than the accused here even though the harm caused to the victim in _Lim Bock Seng_ was more serious than the victim in the present case.

109    As for _Cheong Chin Kong_, this was a case where the accused was charged under s 338(b) of the PC for negligent driving in failing to keep a proper lookout when making a discretionary right turn on green light where the traffic light was still green in favour of pedestrians instead of dangerous driving. As such, in terms of culpability for the accused in _Cheong Chin Kong_, it would have been lower than the present accused on the facts.

110    Furthermore, in light of the revised provisions under the RTA, for reasons which I had set out earlier, this case might be less relevant. Finally, the accident for this case happened long ago on 18 September 2014, which was decided pre-_Tang Ling Lee_ and hence might be dated.

111    Looking at the trend of cases from the pre-2019 64(1) RTA as well as the recently decided cases under the new s 64(2B)(a) of the RTA where fines were imposed and where there were no other aggravating factors, it would appear that general sentencing guidelines can be drawn for s 64(2B)(a) of the RTA as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="40.48%"> <col width="27.38%"> <col width="32.14%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>Level of Harm/Culpability</u></b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>Fine</u></b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>DQ period</u></b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Low Harm / Low Culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Up to $5,000</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Up to 14 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Low – Medium or Moderate Harm/Culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$5,000 to $10,000</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">14 to 28 months</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

112    These guidelines, besides taking into consideration the legislative intention for a heightened need of deterrence caused by dangerous driving, are merely indicative to assist in our analysis and are to be assessed as a matter of common sense. Each case must be looked at carefully in the entire analysis of the circumstances as a whole. This includes both the factual evidence relating to the accident as well as the medical evidence on the physical injury caused to the victim. It can also be refined further as more cases under the new s 64(2B)(a) of the RTA are decided.

113    In summary, given that I was of the view that the accused’s culpability was at the lower end of the moderate range and hurt caused to the victim was medium, I agreed with the Prosecution that the fine to be imposed on the accused should be somewhere nearer the higher end of the fine range instead of the $4,000 to $6,000 range as suggested by the accused.

114    Nonetheless, as the accused has pleaded guilty and having duly regarded the mitigating factors raised by him as well as his relatively clean driving record after all these years, I imposed a fine of $7,500.

115    As for the DQ order, given that this was at the very least a beating of the red light situation, where there was a clear violation of traffic rules, I agreed with the accused that an uplift from the previous indicative starting point of 9 months to a period of at least 18 months is justified.

116    Where I differed from the Prosecution, is that the DQ period should not be a doubling of the 18 months as ordered in _Koh Thiam Huat_ to 3 years in this case. In _Koh Thiam Huat_, besides the fact that the harm caused to the victim there was more serious, the accused also had a poor driving record. Custodial threshold was clearly crossed in _Koh Thiam Huat_. I therefore declined to impose a 3-year DQ period on the accused on the circumstances of the present case as this would have been too harsh on the accused. At the same time, a DQ period of 18 months would ensure that the primary sentencing consideration of both specific and general deterrence for dangerous driving offences was met.

## Conclusion

117    To summarise, the accused was accordingly sentenced as follows:

118    As the accused did not apply for a stay of the disqualification order pending appeal, the accused has been serving out the disqualification order imposed on him since 10 November 2020.
