Contract – Contractual terms

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in DCA 2/2021/01\].

9 April 2021

### District Judge Lim Wee Ming:

## Introduction

1       The plaintiff’s claim against the defendant is for the sum of US$92,000, transferred from the plaintiff’s account with the defendant, to a bank account in South Africa in the name of the plaintiff’s investment manager. The plaintiff claims that the transfer was pursuant to a request that was not made by the plaintiff, but by an unauthorised person who had hacked into the plaintiff’s email account.

2       I dismissed the plaintiff’s claim. The plaintiff has appealed against my decision.

## Facts

3       The plaintiff is an investment fund incorporated in the Cayman Islands. The plaintiff’s investment manager is Nech Capital Pte Ltd (“Nech Capital”). The sole shareholder of Nech Capital is Chan Ka-Wei Neil (“Neil Chan”). Neil Chan is one of two directors of Nech Capital and the director of the plaintiff.[^1]

4       The defendant is a brokerage firm offering financial services and products, including stock broking, margin financing, futures, options and derivatives.

5       Between July 2017 and March 2018, the plaintiff opened four accounts with the defendant, including:

> (a)     an equities trading account (“the Equities Trading Account”), and

> (b)     a derivatives trading account (“the Derivatives Trading Account”), sub-divided into accounts QQ-199A and QQ-199B.

6       On 17 April 2019, the defendant received a request from Neil Chan’s email address, to transfer a sum of US$92,000 from account QQ-199A to an account with First National Bank in South Africa in the name of Nech Capital.[^2] The defendant executed the transfer as requested, after sending a confirmation email to Neil Chan, to which there was no response.[^3] The confirmation email was also sent to other officers of the plaintiff, who similarly did not respond.

7       The aforesaid withdrawal request was made, soon after the defendant had rejected two earlier requests for funds to be transferred to a Hong Kong bank account in the name of Sallywei Ltd (“Sallywei”). The first such request was for the sum of US$98,000, which the defendant rejected due to insufficient funds in the account. The second such request was for the sum of US$92,000. The defendant rejected this second request as the beneficiary was a third party.

8       Each of the aforesaid withdrawal requests were dealt with by Tan Chuen Kiat, the defendant’s Manager, Global Derivatives Sales at the material time,[^4] and Lim Boon Hong, the defendant’s Operations Associate.[^5]

9       It was only on 23 April 2019, that Neil Chan informed the defendant that the 17 April 2019 withdrawal of US$92,000 for Nech Capital was fraudulent. According to Neil Chan:

> (a)     On 22 April 2019, he discovered that he was not receiving emails from Liu Ning, a director of Nech Capital. Neil Chan contacted his email vendor, Microsoft 365, who informed him that a sender block rule had been created over his email account, blocking emails sent to him from Liu Ning, the defendant and Crowe Horwath (the plaintiff’s fund administrator). The sender block rule was terminated and he went through the emails which he did not receive previously. [^6]

> (b)     On 23 April 2019, he discovered an email from the defendant of the same day, informing the plaintiff that the defendant was processing a withdrawal request of US$40,000 from account QQ-199B. Neil Chan instructed the defendant not to execute the withdrawal request which was not made by him.[^7]

> (c)     Later that day, he discovered the withdrawal of the sum of US$92,000 on 17 April 2019 and informed the defendant that it was a fraudulent transfer.[^8] Neil Chan claims that he had not seen the confirmation email sent by the defendant before the transfer was executed, as the unauthorised person who had used his email account had set up the sender block rule, blocking his receipt of emails from the defendant, Liu Ning and Crowe Horwath.

10     Neil Chan reported the incident to the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the police.[^9] Neil Chan obtained a report from Nech Capital’s IT vendor, Latitude Services Pte Ltd (“Latitude Services”), and was advised that the breach could have occurred through a compromised public wifi source, or a compromised work-station or laptop where he may have signed into his email account.[^10]

11     Neil Chan requested that the defendant compensate the plaintiff. However, the defendant disputed the plaintiff’s claim. The plaintiff commenced the action herein against the defendant.

## Plaintiff’s position

12     The plaintiff’s claim against the defendant is for the aforesaid sum of US$92,000, which the plaintiff claims was transferred on the instructions of personnel not authorised by the plaintiff.[^11]

13     In the affidavit of evidence-in-chief of Neil Chan, he states that he believes that his signature on the defendant’s withdrawal form for the sum of US$92,000 dated 17 April 2019, was cut and pasted from a withdrawal form that he sent to the defendant on 29 March 2019.[^12] Neil Chan claims that his email account had been compromised by an unauthorised person who made use of his email account to give the aforesaid instruction to the defendant. Neil Chan also made this allegation with respect to the two earlier withdrawal requests that were rejected by the defendant. However, no expert evidence was adduced to support this bare allegation.

14     The four key withdrawal forms, relevant to the plaintiff’s claim are:

> (a)     A withdrawal form dated 29 March 2019 for the sum of US$50,000 from account QQ-199A, which was authorised and signed by Neil Chan (“the 29 March 2019 Withdrawal Form”).[^13]

> (b)     A withdrawal form dated 16 April 2019 for the sum of US$98,000 from account QQ-199A to be remitted to a Hong Kong bank account in the name of Sallywei (“the US$98,000 Withdrawal Request for Sallywei”).[^14] The plaintiff’s position is that Neil Chan’s signature on this withdrawal form was copied and pasted from the 29 March 2019 Withdrawal Form. The defendant rejected the US$98,000 Withdrawal Request for Sallywei, due to insufficient funds in the account.[^15]

> (c)     A withdrawal form dated 17 April 2019 for the sum of US$92,000 from account QQ-199A to be remitted to a Hong Kong bank account in the name of Sallywei (“the US$92,000 Withdrawal Request for Sallywei”).[^16] The plaintiff again alleges that Neil Chan’s signature on this withdrawal form was copied and pasted from the 29 March 2019 Withdrawal Form. The defendant rejected the US$92,000 Withdrawal Request for Sallywei, as the transfer was to a third party.[^17]

> (d)     A withdrawal form dated 17 April 2019 in the sum of US$92,000 from account QQ-199A to be remitted to an account with First National Bank in South Africa in the name of Nech Capital (“the US$92,000 Withdrawal Request for Nech Capital”).[^18] The plaintiff again takes the position that Neil Chan’s signature on this withdrawal form was copied and pasted from the 29 March 2019 Withdrawal Form. This time, the defendant executed the transfer pursuant to the request, after sending a confirmation email to Neil Chan and other officers of the plaintiff, to which there was no response.

15     The plaintiff’s position is that there were red flags that should have alerted the defendant to the unauthorised requests for withdrawal, including:

> (a)     The US$98,000 Withdrawal Request for Sallywei was for a sum in excess of the funds in the plaintiff’s account.

> (b)     The US$98,000 Withdrawal Request for Sallywei and the US$92,000 Withdrawal Request for Sallywei were for the funds to be transferred to a third party.

> (c)     The US$92,000 Withdrawal Request for Nech Capital, was for the funds to be transferred to a South African bank.

16     The plaintiff further claims that the defendant did not comply with its own guidelines for processing payment, by failing to call Neil Chan to confirm that the transaction was unauthorised.

17     The plaintiff also claims that the defendant is in breach of the plaintiff’s Standard Settlement Instruction (“SSI”)/Mandate by transferring money to an account that was not designated by the plaintiff.[^19]

## Defendant’s position

18     The defendant’s position is that it was entitled to make payment pursuant to the US$92,000 Withdrawal Request for Nech Capital, as:

> (a)     the signature matched their record of Neil Chan’s signature,

> (b)     the beneficiary was Nech Capital, which fully owns and controls the plaintiff, and

> (c)     the fact that payment was being made to a South African bank account does not give rise to suspicion.

19     The defendant further relies on:

> (a)     An email dated 17 April 2019 at 3:01pm, sent by the defendant to the plaintiff’s Neil Chan confirming the US$92,000 Withdrawal Request for Nech Capital.[^20] The email states “Please be informed that we are processing your withdrawal …” for US$92,000, and “If you have any queries on the above mentioned, please do not hesitate to contact the undersigned.” This email was also sent to:

>> (i)       Liu Ning, a director of Nech Capital,[^21]

>> (ii)       Sun Shuzhang, the plaintiff’s trader of the Derivatives Trading Account,[^22] and

>> (iii)       Crowe Horwath, the plaintiff’s fund administrator.[^23]

> Neither Neil Chan, nor the other recipients, responded to object to this withdrawal request.

> (b)     Clause A11.1 of the Derivatives General Terms and Conditions (“the Exception Clause”), which provides:

>> … in the absence of fraud or wilful default on the part of \[the defendant\], it shall not be liable to the customer in any respect of any Loss suffered by the Customer.

20     As for the plaintiff’s reliance on the SSI/Mandate, the defendant has pointed out that the SSI/Mandate only applies to the Equities Trading Account.

## Issues

21     The key issues are as follows:

> (a)     Whether the withdrawal instructions should have raised a red flag.

> (b)     Whether the defendant complied with its own guidelines.

> (c)     Whether the defendant may rely on the SSI/Mandate.

> (d)     The impact of the plaintiff’s failure to respond to the defendant’s confirmation email.

> (e)     Whether the defendant may rely on the Exception Clause.

## Whether the withdrawal instructions should have raised a red flag

22     The plaintiff claims that there were red flags relating to:

> (a)     the attempted withdrawals for Sallywei, and

> (b)     the US$92,000 Withdrawal Request for Nech Capital.

### The attempted withdrawals for Sallywei

23     The plaintiff claims that there were red flags relating to the US$98,000 Withdrawal Request for Sallywei and the US$92,000 Withdrawal Request for Sallywei.

24     In relation to the US$98,000 Withdrawal Request for Sallywei which was rejected by the defendant, the plaintiff raised the issue that this withdrawal instruction should have caused the defendant to be suspicious, as the withdrawal instruction was for a sum larger than the balance in the plaintiff’s derivatives trading account. In _Major Shipping & Trading Inc v Standard Chartered Bank (Singapore) Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 4</span> (“_Major Shipping_”) at \[87\], it was held that a request for an account balance was not a red flag, as there were many innocuous explanations as to why a customer might email a request for the account balance. Similarly, I am of the view that the instruction to withdraw a sum larger than the balance in the account, would not give rise to a red flag. In any event, the US$98,000 Withdrawal Request for Sallywei was rejected by the defendant.

25     The plaintiff has further raised that the attempted withdrawals for Sallywei, should have given rise to a red flag, as they were for payment to be made to a third party’s bank account in Hong Kong. However, the defendant had rejected payment to Sallywei on the basis that the payment was being made to a third party. No further steps were taken to insist that payment be made to Sallywei. In the premises, I am unable to accept that this gives rise to a red flag.

26     The plaintiff has also raised that the reference to “invoice” instead of withdrawal form, in an email sent to the defendant attaching the US$92,000 Withdrawal Request for Sallywei,[^24] should have caused the defendant to be suspicious of the transaction. The aforesaid email was one of a series of emails exchanged relating to the withdrawal. In the premises, it is not unreasonable that a reference to “invoice" instead of withdrawal form, may be seen as an innocuous error, rather than a red flag indicating fraud.

### The US$92,000 Withdrawal Request for Nech Capital

27     After the attempted withdrawals for Sallywei were rejected, the defendant received a message from Neil Chan’s email address, stating “We have to transfer the funds overseas we only have 2 Nech Capital Pte. Ltd accounts in Australia and South Africa. This is not 3rd party accounts.”[^25] Shortly thereafter, the defendant received the US$92,000 Withdrawal Request for Nech Capital, which the defendant executed.

28     The plaintiff has submitted that the US$92,000 Withdrawal Request for Nech Capital, for payment to an account in South Africa should have given rise to suspicion. However, Tan Chuen Kiat’s evidence is that:

> First National Bank is a reputable bank in South Africa. I am aware that South Africa has not been highlighted as a high-risk jurisdiction by the Monetary Authority of Singapore.[^26]

29     The plaintiff has not disputed Tan Chuen Kiat’s aforesaid evidence. In the premises, I am of the view that the instructions for the transfer to be made to an account in South Africa in the name of Nech Capital, does not raise a red flag.

30     The plaintiff has also raised that the US$92,000 Withdrawal Request for Nech Capital, had an error in that the company’s name above the signature in the form was indicated as “Chan Ka-Wei Neil”,[^27] instead of the plaintiff’s name “Nech Asia Fund”. The plaintiff’s submission is that this should have given rise to a red flag. The defendant has pointed out that there was an earlier authorised withdrawal form that also contained a similar error in that the company’s name was “Nech Capital Pte Ltd”, instead of the plaintiff’s name “Nech Asia Fund”.[^28] Furthermore, the plaintiff’s name “Nech Asia Fund” correctly appears at the top of the disputed form, in the box for account name.[^29] In the premises, I am of the view that this error does not give rise to a red flag.

31     I further considered whether the aforesaid matters raised by the plaintiff, may collectively give rise to a red flag. In _Major Shipping_, the High Court observed at \[90\], that:

> … The plaintiff did not offer any theory or explanation of how factors that were not individually suspicious would collectively give rise to suspicion to put the Bank on notice of a possible fraud. \[The plaintiff’s expert’s\] opinion on the collective and cumulative effect of the “red flags” was premised on the “red flags” being suspicious in and of themselves. I rejected that premise. In the circumstances, there was no cogent and credible evidence supporting the plaintiff’s submission that the “red flags” collectively put the Bank on notice of a possible fraud.

32     In the present case, there is similarly no expert evidence offering any theory or explanation as to how even if each factor was not individually suspicious, they could collectively give rise to suspicion. In the absence of such evidence and in view of my finding that the individual factors raised by the plaintiff do not give rise to a red flag, there is no evidence that these factors collectively would give rise to suspicion.

## Whether the defendant complied with its own guidelines

33     The plaintiff has submitted that the defendant had failed to call the customer to confirm that the withdrawal instruction was authorised, contrary to the defendant’s own guidelines.[^30] However, the defendant has pointed out that this guideline only applies in relation to individual retail customers.[^31]

34     The relevant provision is paragraph 2.2 of the guideline which provides:

> For individual retail customers, e-mail request is accepted subject to verification of the authenticity of the e-mail request as per paragraph 3.2 below.[^32]

35     Paragraph 3.2 of the guidelines provides:

> Futures Settlement will call the customer using the customer’s contact number on file to confirm that the withdrawal instruction was actually given and authorised by the customer.[^33]

36     The plaintiff’s argument is that the reference to “individual retail customers” in paragraph 2.2 of the guidelines, does not mean that corporate customers are not subject to this guideline. The plaintiff’s argument is that there is a difference between a withdrawal instruction being authorised and a withdrawal instruction being authentic.[^34] I am unable to accept this argument, which artificially breaks down the withdrawal instruction into two parts. There would be no need for paragraph 2.2 of the guidelines, if there is no distinction on the verification required between individual retail customers and corporate customers.

37     The plaintiff has further submitted that where payment is made to a third party, the defendant’s guidelines also require the defendant to call the customer.[^35] The relevant provision is paragraph 8.1(d) of the guidelines which provides that:

> … for any client request to withdraw money to be paid to a 3rd party … a phone call has been made to the customer to obtain verbal confirmation that the instruction was in fact authorized by customer.[^36]

38     However, this guideline does not apply where the customer is 100% owned and controlled by the third party payee. Paragraph 7.2 of the guidelines expressly provides:

> Where the customer is a corporation that is 100% owned and controlled by the payee, the payee is considered as one and same party i.e. not a 3rd party for the purpose of assessing ML risk.[^37]

> \[Emphasis original\]

39     The plaintiff’s position is that Nech Capital does not own the plaintiff, as the ultimate beneficial owner of the plaintiff are its investors.

40     The defendant relies on the following documents submitted by the plaintiff to the defendant:

> (a)     The Register of Members showing that Nech Capital is the only member of the plaintiff.

> (b)     The Certificate of Incumbency showing that Nech Capital is the only shareholder of the plaintiff.[^38]

41     I am of the view that the defendant may rely on the aforesaid documents furnished by the plaintiff. The defendant is not required to look behind those documents to ascertain the ultimate beneficial owners who have not been disclosed by the plaintiff. The practical reality is that the ultimate beneficial owners do not play a role in verifying the authenticity of transactions, and there is no evidence that they play such a role. As such, ownership in this context must mean legal ownership, rather than ultimate beneficial ownership.

42     In the light of the aforesaid reasons, I am not satisfied that the plaintiff has shown that the defendant has failed to follow its own guidelines.

## Whether the plaintiff may rely on the SSI/Mandate

43     In the plaintiff’s statement of claim, the plaintiff seeks to rely on the SSI/Mandate in support of its position that the defendant had breached the plaintiff’s SSI/Mandate by making payment to a bank account not authorised by the plaintiff.[^39]

44     The plaintiff’s statement of claim referring to the SSI/Mandate, states as follows:

> … all request for transfer of funds or securities from or to the **Equity Trading Account** shall be made to and/or from the Plaintiff’s custodian multi-currency account … with the Development Bank of Singapore …[^40]

> \[Emphasis added\]

45     It is clear from the aforesaid extract that the SSI/Mandate only applies to the Equities Trading Account. There is no documentation to suggest that it should also apply to the Derivatives Trading Account. In the premises, I am of the view that the plaintiff cannot rely on the SSI/Mandate to claim that the defendant had breached the SSI/Mandate in transferring the sum of US$92,000 from the Derivatives Trading Account to a non-designated account.

## Plaintiff’s failure to respond to the defendant’s confirmation email

46     After receiving the US$92,000 Withdrawal Request for Nech Capital, the defendant sent a confirmation email on 17 April 2019 at 3:01 pm to the plaintiff’s Neil Chan, Liu Ning and Sun Shuzhang, as well as Crowe Horwath, the plaintiff’s fund administrator.[^41] None of them responded to dispute the transaction at the material time.

47     Neil Chan’s evidence was that a transfer of funds should be preceded by a phone call or email.[^42] In this case, the defendant did send a confirmation email, but Neil Chan claims that he did not receive this email.

48     Neil Chan claims that his email account had been compromised and that a sender block rule had been set up blocking emails sent to him by the defendant, Liu Ning and Crowe Horwath.[^43] As a result, he did not receive the confirmation email on the material day.

49     However, none of the other three recipients of the confirmation email responded to dispute the transaction either. Liu Ning’s evidence is that, “When I read the email, I did not find it unusual as this appeared to me as a usual course of business activities between the Plaintiffs and the Defendants.”[^44] The other two recipients of the email, Sun Shuzhang and Crowe Horwath, did not give evidence for the trial.

50     The plaintiff has submitted that the confirmation email merely states that US$92,000 was being withdrawn from the plaintiff’s Derivatives Trading Account, and does not state the mode of withdrawal, nor the destination bank account, otherwise Liu Ning or Crowe Horwath could have detected the fraud.[^45] I am unable to agree with this submission. No evidence was adduced by the plaintiff that they were expecting a transaction in the region of US$92,000 at that time, but that the payee was to have been another party or to another account. If the recipients of the confirmation email who would have more knowledge of the plaintiff’s business did not find the transaction suspicious after receiving the confirmation email, there would be even less reason for the defendant, who has less knowledge of the plaintiff’s business, to find the transaction suspicious.

51     Furthermore, although Neil Chan had approached his email vendor, Microsoft 365, and Nech Capital’s IT vendor, Latitude Services, for assistance,[^46] neither one of them was called upon to give evidence to support his allegation that his email account had been compromised and that a sender block rule had been set-up without his knowledge. The plaintiff has raised the argument that the defendant has agreed to the authenticity and admissibility of the Latitude Report.[^47] However, that does little to advance the plaintiff’s case, as there was no agreement on the contents of the Latitude Report.

## Exception Clause

52     The defendant in its defence, further relies on the Exception Clause which provides:

> … in the absence of fraud or wilful default on the part of \[the defendant\], it shall not be liable to the customer in any respect of any Loss suffered by the Customer.[^48]

53     The plaintiff has in its submissions, relied on section 2(2) of the Unfair Contract Terms Act (Cap 396, 1994 Rev Ed) (“UCTA”) and argues that the Exception Clause is inapplicable as it does not satisfy the requirement of reasonableness.[^49] However, this was never pleaded by the plaintiff, as no reply was filed by the plaintiff in response to the defendant’s defence.

54     In _Major Shipping_ at \[108\], it was expressly pleaded that an exclusion clause contravened UCTA. As the plaintiff in the present case has not pleaded that the Exception Clause is unreasonable, this should suffice to dispose of this submission.

55     Furthermore, in view of my earlier findings, I am not persuaded that there was any wilful default on the part of the defendant. The confirmation email was sent to three of the plaintiff’s officers and Crowe Horwath, none of whom responded to dispute the withdrawal instruction at the material time. In the premises, the defendant is entitled to rely on the Exception Clause and is not liable to the plaintiff for its loss.

## Conclusion

56     In the light of the aforesaid reasons, the plaintiff’s claim was dismissed. Parties were directed to file written submissions on costs.
