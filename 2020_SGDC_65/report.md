### District Judge Chee Min Ping:

## Introduction

1       The accused, Mr Hamid s/o Ibrahim, is a 73-year-old man who pleaded guilty to one charge under s 324 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”) of voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapon or means. During a domestic dispute, the accused stabbed his wife, the victim, 24 times at various parts of her body using a kitchen knife with a blade measuring 16 cm. The victim sustained 24 lacerations, which resulted in surgery and hospitalisation for 7 days and outpatient sick leave for 4 days.

2       The accused was sentenced to an imprisonment term of 6 months. He has appealed against the sentence imposed.

## Charge

3       The charge to which the accused pleaded guilty reads as follows:

> \[You\] … are charged that you, on the 23rd November 2018, at or about 6.45 am, at Apt Blk 143 Serangoon North Avenue 1 #XXX, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Siti Kamariah bte Abu Sama (Female / 66 years old) by stabbing the said Siti Kamariah Bte Abu Sama, a total of 24 times on her left arm and forearm, her left buttock and the back of her body, using a kitchen knife with a blade measuring about 16 cm in length, such kitchen knife being an instrument for cutting, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 324 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224….

## Facts

4       The accused admitted without qualification to the Statement of Facts, which set out the following salient facts. On 23 November 2018 at about 6.00 am, the accused and the victim were at their residence at Blk 143 Serangoon North Avenue 1 #XXX Singapore 550143. While the accused was in the bathroom taking a shower, the victim picked up the accused’s mobile phone and read some of the accused’s messages. The victim believed that some of the messages were between the accused and persons that he was romantically interested in.

5       At about 6.45 am on the same day, the accused finished his shower and left the bathroom. The accused placed his unwashed set of clothing in a blue pail and was bringing the pail towards the kitchen, where the washing machine is located. The victim went to the kitchen, and began to question the accused about the chat messages that she had found on the accused’s mobile phone. Essentially, the victim demanded to know why the accused was chatting with persons with whom the victim said the accused was romantically involved. The accused stated that the chats he had were with customers from work. An argument ensued between the accused and the victim.

6       The accused lost his temper during the argument and used the blue pail, which was empty, to hit the victim repeatedly on the head until the pail broke into three parts. The accused noticed that a kitchen knife had been left in the kitchen sink area. The accused picked up the kitchen knife which had a blade measuring 16 cm, and stabbed the victim 13 times on her left arm and forearm, 6 times on her left buttock, and 5 times on her back.

7       The accused then dropped the kitchen knife in the sink and walked out of the kitchen. The accused then called for the police, and remained in the kitchen until the police and paramedics arrived.

8       The victim was conveyed to the Sengkang General Hospital by ambulance. According to a medical report prepared by Dr Sharmini Su A Sivarajah from the Sengkang General Hospital dated 11 December 2018, upon examination of the victim on 23 November 2018, the victim was found to have suffered the following injuries:

> (a)     Left arm and forearm: 13 lacerations in total, 7 on the anterolateral aspect of the arm and 6 on the dorsal aspect of the forearm, about 2 to 3 cm in length. No tendons or muscles were involved.

> (b)     Left buttock: 6 lacerations, 3 of which were about 3 cm in length, and the rest were about 1 cm. None of the wounds on the left buttock breached the muscle layer.

> (c)     Back: 5 lacerations, about 3 to 4 cm in length, with muscle breach on two of the lacerations.

9       The victim underwent a CT scan of her thorax, abdomen and pelvis, which did not reveal any other injuries related to the incident. The victim underwent wound exploration and closure of wounds under general anaesthesia on the same day. The victim recovered well post operatively with antibiotics and analgesia, and was discharged from hospital on 29 November 2018 to her oldest daughter’s home. The victim’s medical certificate was tendered, indicating that she had been given medical leave until 3 December 2018.

## Antecedents

10     The accused did not have any antecedents.

## Prosecution’s Submissions

11     The prosecution submitted that a sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment was appropriate in the circumstances. The prosecution submitted that the court ought to adopt the sentencing approach applied by the High Court in the case of _Ng Soon Kim v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 247</span> (“_Ng Soon Kim_”). The prosecution submitted that the _Ng Soon Kim_ sentencing approach, which is applicable for offences under s 324 of the Penal Code, would require the court to first consider the appropriate sentence had the hurt caused been the subject of an offence under s 323 of the Penal Code. This was to be done having regard to the sentencing framework laid down by the High Court in respect of sentencing for offences under s 323 of the Penal Code laid down in the case of _Low Song Chye v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 526</span> (“_Low Song Chye_”). At the second step, the court will have to apply a suitable uplift having regard to the dangerous means used, taking into account the potential harm posed by the dangerous means. At the third step, the court then calibrates the appropriate sentence on account of the various aggravating and mitigating circumstances.

12     Applying _Ng Soon Kim_, the prosecution submitted that the hurt caused in the form of 24 lacerations, resulting in a short 7 days’ hospitalisation period would fall within Band 2 of the _Low Song Chye_ framework for s 323 offences. The prosecution submitted that the indicative starting point was 2 months’ imprisonment, given that the accused had committed spousal violence, which is an aggravating factor. As the kitchen knife used had the potential to cause grievous injuries or death, but was not a large weapon or implement, the prosecution submitted that an appropriate uplift to 8 months’ imprisonment was appropriate at the second step of the _Ng Soon Kim_ sentencing approach. At the third step, taking into account the accused’s lack of antecedents, plea of guilt and the forgiveness of the victim, the prosecution submitted that a total imprisonment term of 6 months’ imprisonment was appropriate.

13     While the prosecution also cited a number of sentencing precedents in a table of precedents and submitted that an imprisonment term of 6 months is in line with the cited precedents, the prosecution has acknowledged that these cases were decided prior to the High Court’s decision in _Ng Soon Kim_.

## Mitigation Plea

14     Counsel for the accused submitted that 4 months’ imprisonment was an appropriate sentence. In mitigation, counsel for the accused submitted that the court ought to consider the accused’s timely plea of guilt as a sign of his contrition and regret for the offence, and that the offence was committed due to a moment of emotional aggression. Counsel for the accused submitted that while the victim’s allegations of infidelity could not constitute provocation, the accused’s commission of the offence should be viewed in its proper context, which is that he had been undergoing a period of great stress and anxiety due to the victim’s constant suspicion of him. It was such stress that resulted in the accused’s commission of the offence.

15     Counsel for the accused submitted the accused should be given “credit” given that the accused had made diligent effort to practice self-help, in particular, by attending counselling at Shan You Counselling Centre to cope with his stress and anger. A counsellor’s report from Shan You Counselling Centre was tendered as evidence of the steps taken by the accused to attend counselling, and to practise stress management techniques.

16     Counsel for the accused also submitted that the court should give due consideration to the fact that the injuries sustained were not serious, as two out of 24 wounds inflicted breached the muscle layer. Further, this was the accused’s first brush with the law.

17     In the mitigation plea, the reliance was placed on a medical report from Dr Lim Yun Chin from Raffles Hospital dated 28 February 2019. Dr Lim’s opinion is extracted as follows:

> …

> It appeared that Hamid committed the offence under extreme provocation which has been on going for the past 2 years. Reconstructing Hamid’s mental state at the time of the alleged offence, it seemed it was the proverbial last straw for him. There was no evidence of premeditation on his part.

> Hamid’s behaviour at the time of the alleged offence was out of character and affirmed by all his grown-up children and other people who knew the family. Hamid himself was remorseful for his actions and seemed bent to accept whatever the consequence of his ‘terrible’ behaviour… Given the culture and religious resilience in this family, I am confident that such episode wouldn’t be repeated….

18     Various letters were also annexed to the mitigation plea, such as one from the victim, stating that the victim did not wish to pursue the matter and wished to resolve the matter privately as a family. Testimonials from the accused’s children and siblings attesting to his good character and his role as a respected and loving father were also annexed. In these letters, the accused’s children stated that the victim had, for a considerable period of time, been demonstrating possessive and jealous behaviour, causing the accused to feel stressed and depressed. Other testimonials were also annexed, including those from the accused’s colleagues, friend and neighbour, which all attested to his strong work ethic demonstrated in his occupation as an interpreter and that the accused has been a good husband and father.

## Applicable Law

19     Section 324 of the Penal Code provides that the offence of voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means is punishable with imprisonment for a term that may extend to seven years, or with fine or caning or any combination of such punishments. In particular, such dangerous weapons or means, as stipulated by s 324 of the Penal Code, include:

> (a)     any instrument for shooting, stabbing or cutting,

> (b)     any instrument which, used as a weapon of offence, is likely to cause death,

> (c)     any fire or any heated substance,

> (d)     any poison or any corrosive substance,

> (e)     any explosive substance,

> (f)     any substance which it is harmful to the human body to inhale, to swallow or to receive into the blood; or

> (g)     any animal.

20     The High Court noted in _Ng Soon Kim_ at \[11\] that some of these disparate means are likely to be more egregious than other means, although much will depend on the particular facts. The High Court considered in _Ng Soon Kim_ that given the lack of sufficient jurisprudence dealing with sentencing under s 324, it was not necessarily a viable exercise to prescribe a sentencing framework. The High Court adopted a three-stage process in arriving at the appropriate sentence for the offender in _Ng Soon Kim._

21     At the first stage, the High Court considered what would be an appropriate sentence for an offence under s 324 of the Penal Code had the hurt alone been the subject of an offence under s 323 of the Penal Code. In doing so, the High Court applied the sentencing framework laid down in _Low Song Chye v PP_, applicable for first-time offenders who pleaded guilty to an offence under s 323 of the Penal Code. At the second stage, the court was to decide on a suitable uplift, having considered the dangerous means used. At the third step, the court was to calibrate the sentence on account of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances at play, such as a timeous plea of guilt and the accused’s lack of antecedents.

## Application to the Facts

22     Applying the _Ng Soon Kim_ sentencing approach to the present case, I was of the view that the hurt caused to the victim fell within Band 2 of the _Low Song Chye_ framework. In _Low Song Chye_ at \[83\], the High Court stated that Band 2 includes cases in which moderate harm was caused, such as simple fractures, temporary or mild loss of hearing or sight, as well as injuries that result in hospitalisation for a short time and/or a substantial period of medical leave. Accordingly, the indicative sentencing range would be between four weeks’ to 6 months’ imprisonment. In the present case, as many as 24 lacerations were inflicted upon the victim at extensive parts of her body. While the wounds inflicted were not necessarily deep, as can be seen from the victim’s medical report (see \[8\] above) stating that 2 out of the 24 lacerations penetrated the muscle layer, the hurt inflicted by the accused resulted in surgery and 7 days’ hospitalisation. There was an absence of evidence that the victim suffered from any permanent disabilities or medical problems as a result of the assault. Therefore, the actual harm inflicted in the present case fell within the lower spectrum of Band 2 of _Low Song Chye_’s framework_._

23     In _Ng Soon Kim_ at \[14\], the High Court considered relevant offence specific factors at the first step of analysis. Specifically, in _Ng Soon Kim_, the High Court ascribed due weight to the fact that the offence of causing hurt by means of fire occurred in the context of a road rage incident. Applying the High Court’s approach in the present case, it was necessary, at the first step of the analysis, to consider the prosecution’s submission that spousal violence was to be treated as an aggravating factor. In making this submission, the prosecution relied on the case of _PP v Luan Yuanxin_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 SLR(R) 613</span> at \[17\] (cited with approval more recently in the High Court decision of _PP v Satesh s/o Navarian_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 119</span> at \[13\] and \[26\]), which stated:

> Violent acts such as these are particularly heinous when they are committed within the confines of the familial relationship as they constitute an abuse of the bonds of trust and interdependency that exist between family members.

24     It was not disputed that the accused had been dealing with allegations of infidelity from the victim, which had been a significant stressor for the accused in the period leading up to the commission of the offence. It was also not disputed that the accused had committed the offence without premeditation, in response to what he perceived to be persistent accusations from the victim as to his fidelity. That said, it was necessary to have regard to the principle that certain crimes committed out of anger warrant general deterrence, as stated by the Court of Appeal in _PP v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 127</span> at \[93\] – \[98\]. This principle was of apt application in the context of a familial relationship.

25     There was no merit to the argument by counsel for the accused that the court ought to attribute weight to Dr Lim’s report (at \[17\]) above, stating that he had:

> … committed the alleged offence under extreme provocation which has been ongoing the past 2 years… Reconstructing Hamid’s mental state at the time of the alleged offence, it seemed it was the proverbial last straw for him. There was no evidence of premeditation on his part.

26     The report read like fact-finding report rather than a medical opinion, stating a favourable version of what had been in the accused’s mind, even though the very same report stated that there “is no evidence that Hamid has a mental illness diagnosis”. Given that there was nothing in the report that purported to be an opinion as to any medical or psychiatric condition, it was not appropriate to place any weight on the “findings” stated in this report (as was the approach taken by the High Court in an analogous situation _Mehra Radhika v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 1 SLR 96</span> at \[67\] – \[68\]; see also _Ho Mei Xia Hannah v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 978</span> at \[50\] and _Kanagaratnam Nicholas Jens v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 887</span> at \[31\] – \[32\] and \[40\]).

27     Counsel for the accused also relied on one paragraph in the psychiatric assessment report issued by Dr Lee Jia Jonathan from the Institute of Mental Health on 6 December 2018 which stated that:

> 18    I opine that the accused has no mental illness. Based on his account and from corroborative sources, it is evident that he has been facing ongoing stress from his wife over the past year due to her constant suspicion and allegations of infidelity. This has caused him to feel helpless and at a loss for what to do, as evidenced by his cries for help over text to his children. Based on his children’s report, he probably contemplated suicide at some point about 3 months ago due to stress from the marital conflict…

28     However, read in context, within the very same paragraph of the psychiatric assessment report, it would be clear that the portion quoted by counsel related to some of the background information gathered by Dr Lee, which formed the basis of Dr Lee’s opinion that the accused did not suffer from any mental illness. Dr Lee said so in no equivocal terms in the same report, that:

> … However, because this stress did not cause any significant impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning, **_he does not meet the criteria for a stress-related disorder such as an adjustment disorder (as specified under DSM-V)._**

> 19    He was not of unsound mind at the time of the alleged offence. In my opinion, his report of having “blanked out” at the time of the offence is unlikely to be a dissociative episode (an episode characterised by the disruption in normal integration of consciousness, memory, perception and behaviour). I say this in view of his ability to clearly recall the details of his actions, the short duration of time which he reportedly “blanked out” for, and his ability to maintain the presence of mind to call the police and change his clothes immediately after having committed the alleged offence. It is more likely that he acted on an \[_sic_\] his emotions of anger and rage, which so filled him such that he did not actively consider the impact of actions and its consequences until he had already committed the alleged offence – a feeling which he now describes as having his “mind blank”. **_That said, I find no pre-existing or present impairment of the mind that would have resulted in the loss of the ability to exercise his volitional choice, or a loss in impulse control._**

> \[emphasis added in **_bold italics_**\]

The relevance of the accused’s feelings of stress and depressed mood due to his marital conflict with his wife has already been considered (at \[24\] above), and there was nothing in Dr Lee’s report which cast a different light on the factual circumstances leading up to the commission of the offence.

29     In view of the nature of the injury inflicted on the victim and that such injury was inflicted in the context of a domestic relationship, the appropriate indicative starting point was in the region of 2 to 2.5 months’ imprisonment.

30     At the second step of the analysis, I considered the appropriate uplift to be given in view of the danger posed by the means used in this case, _viz_, a kitchen knife with a 16 cm long blade. A kitchen knife is clearly capable of causing serious injury, though much would depend on the manner in which it is used. The Statement Facts at \[8\] described the motion of the accused at the material time as that of “stabbing”. In _Ng Soon Kim_, the High Court imposed an uplift of 6 months, in a case where the offence was the use of a lighter coupled with a flammable aerosol (by setting aflame the aerosol fumes) in the closed confines of a taxi. The High Court was of the view that the potential for harm (such as igniting the interior of the car, and causing public alarm as the offence took place at a busy road intersection) warranted a 6 months’ uplift from 2 months’ imprisonment. In the present case, in view of the likelihood of severe injuries by stabbing with a kitchen knife with a 16 cm long blade, I was of the view that a similar uplift of approximately 6 months’ imprisonment was appropriate.

31     At the third step of the analysis, I took into account the accused’s timeous plea of guilt, which obviated the necessity for a trial. I also took into account the accused’s lack of antecedents, particularly given that the accused, who is of mature age, has passed most of his life with a clean record (see _Yap Ah Lai v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 3 SLR 180</span> (“_Yap Ah Lai”_) at \[89\]). I considered the accused’s genuine contrition and remorse to be mitigating but found that the forgiveness of the victim is largely a neutral factor in sentencing, save that it was probably an indication that the accused had indeed demonstrated genuine remorse towards the victim.

32     I considered the various testimonials put forward on account of the accused by his family members, colleague and friend, attesting to his good character (see \[18\] above). With due regard to the High Court’s pronouncements in _Stansilas Fabian Kester v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 755</span> at \[99\] – \[100\], I was of the view that while the accused’s good character might suggest rehabilitative prospect or reduced need for specific deterrence, the need for general deterrence of violence by dangerous means and infliction of violence in the familial setting displaced any limited mitigatory value of the accused’s good character.

33     I also considered the relevance of the accused’s age of 73 years as at the time of passing sentence. There is no general principle that age alone would warrant a moderation of the punishment to be meted out (_PP v UI_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 500</span> at \[78\]), and the court is required to examine the particular circumstances of the case and make an assessment as to whether the impact of the sentence would be crushing on the offender. Put another way, the court is required, applying _Yap Ah Lai_ at \[94\], to consider whether the accused, in light of his age and health condition, would suffer disproportionately from the term of imprisonment unless some moderation is made. On the facts, there was no evidence of any medical or psychiatric condition that might cause the accused to suffer disproportionately from a term of imprisonment. All considered, at the third stage of the analysis, it was appropriate for the sentence to be moderated downwards in view of the mitigating value of the accused’s plea of guilt and genuine remorse, to 6 months’ imprisonment.

34     For completeness, I have considered the prosecution’s submission that the sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment was in line with precedents cited. As the prosecution rightly conceded, these precedents were decided without the benefit of the High Court’s guidance in _Ng Soon Kim._ Furthermore, as the facts in the cited precedents appeared to involve disparate factual circumstances, they did not appear to be appropriate reference points from which any analogy could be drawn.

35     The cases of _PP v Ong Boon Sim_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 308</span> and _PP v Muraleindren s/o Thoondy_ \[2016\] SGDC involved injury inflicted by knives, following conflict with strangers, and did not involve multiple wounds, or injury of similar severity. The injury inflicted in the case of _PP v Lydiawaty bte Ab Rahman_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 303</span> (“_Lydiawaty_”) was in the nature of two lacerations by an ornamental knife, in the context of violence a relationship conflict, during which a number of other offences which were the subject matter of other charges were also committed. In _Keeping Mark John v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 627</span> at \[18\], the High Court stated that unreported sentencing precedents without grounds or explanations are of relatively little, if any, precedential value because they are unreasoned. Given the lack of written grounds of decision relating to the reduction of the sentence imposed in _Lydiawaty_ from 6 months’ to 4 months’ imprisonment for the s 324 charge on appeal, limited reliance could be placed on _Lydiawaty_ as a sentencing precedent.

## Conclusion

36     In the circumstances, the accused was sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment with effect from 2 March 2020. The accused has begun serving his sentence.
