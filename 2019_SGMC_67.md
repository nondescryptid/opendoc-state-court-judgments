\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9238/2019/01\]

31 October 2019

### District Judge John Ng:

This is an appeal filed by the Defence Counsel against the sentence of imprisonment of **3 weeks** imposed on S Elamparithi (male/54 years old), hereinafter referred to as “the Offender”, for the offence of Voluntarily Causing Hurt (“VCH”) punishable under Section 323 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (“the Penal Code”) in _MCN 901679/2018_. The Offender was convicted of the VCH offence after a trial.

2       The convicted charge is as follows:

> **MCN 901679/2018**,

> “You are charged that you, on 13 February 2017, at or about 2.15pm, along Chander Road, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Karuppiah Kajendran, _to wit_, by slapping the left side of his face three times, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).”

3       The Prosecution applied for another charge of VCH in _MCN 901678/2018_, arising from an unconnected incident on a separate occasion committed against a different victim 4 months earlier, to be taken into consideration for sentencing. The Offender admitted to the commission of that offence and consented to that charge being taken into consideration (“TIC”) for the passing of the sentence in MCN 901679/2018.

4       The TIC charge is as follows:

> **MCN 901678/2018**,

> “You are charged that you, on 9 October 2016, at or about 2.15pm, along Chander Road, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Karuppiah Kajendran, _to wit_, by slapping the left side of his face three times, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).”

5       The Offender was initially represented by counsel when he had indicated that he wished to plead guilty at the PTC stage. The case was fixed for PG Mention. The Offender chose not to plead guilty after he was informed by the Prosecution that it was seeking a custodial sentence. Subsequently, he claimed trial to the charge in _MCN 901679/2018_ and defended the charge without counsel. After a 2-day trial, the Offender was convicted of the charge. He then accepted the offer of the Prosecution to TIC the stood down charge in _MCN 901678/2018_ for the purpose of sentence. He then re-engaged the same counsel to mitigate on his behalf and to resist the submissions of the Prosecution for a custodial sentence.

## Summary of the Findings of Fact from the Trial of MCN 901679/2018

6       After evaluating the evidence at trial, I arrived at the following relevant findings of fact in convicting the Offender:

> ·    The victim (PW2) was not a truthful witness when he denied pushing the Offender.

> ·    PW1, who happened to be walking by, testified that he saw the Offender slap the victim on his face after the victim had pushed the Offender and causing him to stumble and drop the things that he was holding in his hands. PW1’s evidence provided the best corroborative evidence for the Offender’s version that the victim had pushed him before he slapped the victim.

> ·    However, the push was not sufficient to constitute a grave and sufficient provocation. The push was neither grave nor a sufficient provocation for the Offender to retaliate by slapping the victim 3 times.

> ·    The Offender was also not able to avail himself of the Right of Private Defence under Section 96 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224, as Section 99(3) of the same Code stipulated that there is no Right of Private Defence in cases in which there is time to have recourse to the protection of the public authorities.

> ·    The Offender admitted that he had slapped the victim’s face 3 times after he was pushed by the victim. This admission of slapping the victim 3 times is to be preferred to the evidence of PW1 that he only saw 2 slaps. The Offender would know how many slaps he executed. The DPP tried to surmise that there was one slap before the push, followed by the 2 slaps observed by PW2. I could not accept the invitation by the DPP to make this inference since PW2 (the victim) denied pushing the Offender.

> ·    I accepted the evidence of the Offender and his wife (DW2) on how the incident emanated from an earlier encounter that they had with the victim driving his lorry against the flow of traffic on a one-way street. That encounter did not result in any physical altercation. The Offender then parked his car and went with his wife to buy some flowers. They were returning to their car when the Offender decided to take photos of the lorry, parked at the nearby bin centre, to lodge a complaint. It was then that the incident of physical contact happened. The victim was unhappy with the Offender taking photos of the lorry and confronted him. During the confrontation, the victim pushed the Offender, causing him to stumble and drop his things. The Offender retaliated by slapping the victim on his face. This formed the substance of the VCH charge for which he was convicted of.

## Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

7       The Prosecution submitted that the appropriate sentence for the offence is a custodial sentence of 4 weeks. The DPP put forth, _inter alia_, the following reasons for suggesting an imprisonment of 4 weeks:

> ·    This was a road rage case and strong deterrence is needed.

> ·    The Offender had claimed trial and was not remorseful for his criminal act.

> ·    The harm caused was low but the Offender’s level of culpability was medium.

> ·    There is another charge of an offence of VCH committed on another day on a different victim to be taken into consideration for sentence.

## Mitigation by Defence Counsel

8       The Defence Counsel (“DC”) submitted, _inter alia_, the following mitigating factors:

> ·    The victim was not a truthful person or an innocent victim. He pushed the Offender, causing him to stumble and almost fall. The Offender had reacted to the push.

> ·    The Offender had made restitution.

> ·    The Offender was a retired prison officer forced into early retirement after having been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions.

> ·    The Offender has no criminal antecedents.

> ·    The harm caused was slight as the injury was minor.

9       The DC submitted that this was not a road rage case. It was submitted that the slaps occurred in the midst of a dispute relating to the victim’s aggression towards the Offender and had nothing to do with any prior conduct of the parties on the road. There were several intervening events between the dispute along Chander Road and the slapping incident in front of the bin center.

## Calibration of the Sentence

10     Section 323 of the Penal Code provides that:

> “Whoever, except in the case provided for by section 334, voluntarily causes hurt shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine which may extend to $5,000, or with both.”

11     In this case, I agree with the submissions of the DC that it was not a road rage case. The Offender had not slapped the victim because he was still enraged by the victim’s driving on Chander Road. The Offender had reacted to the push by the victim which had caused him to stumble and dropped the things he was holding in his hands.

12     Nevertheless, just because the offence in this case may not be fairly considered as a road rage case, it does not mean that a custodial sentence is not warranted.

13     The dominant principle in this case is still Deterrence, both General and Specific Deterrence. The incident had taken place in a public area. The Offender’s slaps on the victim’s face was disproportionate to the push by the victim on him. Specific Deterrence loomed large as there was another VCH charge to be taken into consideration for sentence. This TIC charge is also for an act of violence and is on the face of it more serious as it involves punching instead of slapping a different victim on another occasion. The hurt caused was facial contusion and swelling from the Offender punching that victim once on the left jaw and once on his left cheek. That incident happened just 4 months prior to the present incident.

14     The Prosecution had submitted for a sentence of 4 weeks’ imprisonment. Although the custodial threshold had been crossed and a 4-week term was not excessive, in view of the circumstances of this case, where the injuries caused was minor and the victim had pushed the Offender, I decided on a sentence of 3 weeks, having also taken into account the health conditions of the Offender.
