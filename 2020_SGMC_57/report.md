Criminal Law – Offences – Grievous Hurt

Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9850/2020/01.\]

20 November 2020

### District Judge Teoh Ai Lin:

1       The accused a Grab driver failed to keep a proper lookout whilst making a right turn at a T-junction in a public carpark and negligently collided into an 87-year-old pedestrian crossing the carpark service road. He pleaded guilty to one charge of causing grievous hurt by negligent act under section 338(b) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

2       I sentenced the accused to a $4000 fine in default 2 weeks imprisonment, and a 12-month disqualification order for all classes of driving licences. The accused has paid the fine and appealed against my sentence.

## The Charge

3       The accused pleaded guilty to the following:

> MAC-906384-2020

> You, \[…\] are charged that you, on 19 October 2019, at or about 12.23pm, at the open space carpark located in the vicinity of Blk 608, Bedok Reservoir Road, Singapore 470608, being the driver of motorcar SMN3774C, did cause grievous hurt to one Tan Swee Poh (male, 88 years old) by doing an act so negligently as to endanger the personal safety of others, _to wit_, by failing to keep a proper lookout before executing the right turn at the T-junction in front of Blk 608,Bedok Reservoir Road and consequently colliding into the said Tan Swee Poh who was crossing the service road from your right to left, thereby causing him to suffer a left distal ulna open fracture, left forearm wounds and left upper limb wounds, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 338(b) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

## Material Facts

4       The material facts extracted from the Statement of Facts admitted by the accused are set out below.

5       The accused age 59 is a Singapore citizen. He was driving motorcar registration number SMN3774C (the “Motorcar”) at the material time. The victim is Tan Swee Poh, an 88-year-old male, who was 87 years old at the time of the accident.

6       On 19 October 2019, at or about 12.27pm, one Ryan Tan lodged a Police report that “SCDF /0425: Car n pedestrian”.

7       At or about 12.23pm that day, the accused was driving the Motorcar along the service road within the open space carpark located in the vicinity of Blk 608, Bedok Reservoir Road, Singapore. As the Motorcar approached the T-junction in front of Blk 608, Bedok Reservoir Road, the victim could be seen crossing the road on the accused’s right. This was clearly captured on the accused’s in-car camera.

8       The accused failed to keep a proper lookout before executing the right turn onto the service road that the victim was crossing. The front left of the Motorcar collided into the victim who was in the midst of crossing the service road from the accused’s right to left. The victim fell onto the stone kerb of the handicap parking lot as a result of the collision. The collision was captured on the accused’s in-car camera.

9       The accused and other passers-by proceeded to assist the victim whose left arm was bleeding. One of the passers-by called for an ambulance and the victim was subsequently conveyed to Changi General Hospital to receive medical treatment.

10     The Inpatient Discharge Summary stated that the victim suffered a left distal ulna open fracture, left forearm wounds and left upper limb wounds. He was hospitalised for 18 days from 19 October 2019 to 5 November 2019, and given 14 days of medical leave thereafter.

11     At the material time, the weather was clear, the road surface was dry, visibility was good, and the volume of traffic was low. The Motorcar had no mechanical faults.

12     By virtue of the foregoing, the accused caused grievous hurt to the victim by doing an act so negligently as to endanger the personal safety of others, _to wit_, by failing to keep a proper lookout before executing the right turn at the T-junction in front of Blk 608, Bedok Reservoir Road and consequently colliding into the victim and the accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under section 338(b) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

## Antecedents

13     The accused was convicted in 1984 for two traffic-related offences – driving\\permitting driving with expired driving licence and failing to insure user of motor-vehicle against third-party risks. He was sentenced respectively to $300 fine, and $300 fine with disqualification from driving for one year.

## Prosecution’s submissions for fine and disqualification

14     Prosecution submitted that the accused should be sentenced to fine and disqualification, with quantum of fine and duration of disqualification to be decided by the court.

15     Prosecution stated that the primary sentencing consideration should be general deterrence, and referred to the sentencing framework in _Tang Ling Lee v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 813</span> _(“Tang Ling Lee”_). Applying the first step in the sentencing framework, Prosecution classified the offence as one falling within category 1, in that the harm caused to the victim was low and the accused’s culpability was moderate. At the second step of the inquiry, Prosecution submitted that it was aggravating that the accused had previous traffic-related convictions but not much weight should be placed on them as the antecedents are dated. The accused’s timely plea of guilt and his stopping to assist the victim were mitigating factors.

16     As for the table of sentencing precedents, Prosecution referred only to the second case _PP v Shaik Farid Bin Oli Abdul Latiff_ (MAC-904336-2019) (“_Shaik Farid_”). In that case, the accused had been sentenced to $4000 fine and disqualification order of 12 months.

## Mitigation

17     The accused was unrepresented. In mitigation, he referred to his driving record. He has been a cab-driver for twenty years without any accidents, and there were no demerit points awarded against him for more than ten years. On the day of the incident, the ambulance came and he asked the victim to go to hospital and told the ambulance to send the victim to the hospital. The victim’s daughter had also asked him to convince the victim to stay in hospital and the accused did so. The accused also visited the victim four to five times in hospital.

18     The accused said that he was the sole breadwinner and he had no career apart from driving.

## _Tang Ling Lee_ sentencing framework for s338(b) road traffic offences

19     The High Court in _Tang Ling Lee_ at \[31\] stated that the court is to undertake a two-step inquiry:

> (a)     First, to derive the starting point sentence, the court is to identify the sentencing band within which the offence falls and where the case lies within the presumptive sentencing band, having regard to the twin considerations of harm and culpability.

> (b)     Second, adjustments are to be made taking into account the relevant mitigating and aggravating factors.

20     The three sentencing bands with the presumptive sentencing ranges when the accused claims trial is set out below:

## Issues to be determined

21     The issues for determination were as follows:

> (a)     Applicable sentencing band and where the offence lies within the presumptive sentencing range.

> (b)     The mitigating and aggravating factors and adjustments to be made to sentence.

> (c)     The appropriate sentence to be imposed.

## Issue 1: Applicable sentencing band and where the offence lies within the presumptive sentencing range

### Level of harm is low

22     Under step one in the _Tang Ling Lee_ framework, the court is required to assess the level of harm caused and the accused’s level of culpability.

23     Turning first to level of harm: grievous hurt is an essential ingredient of a s338(b) offence and all victims of such offences would have suffered serious injuries amounting to grievous hurt as defined in the Penal Code. The level of harm suffered by the victim therefore refers to the nature and degree of the grievous bodily injury caused to the victim. The period of hospitalisation leave or medical leave would be relevant as it indicates a medical professional’s opinion as to the length of time required for treatment of the injuries and for the victim to resume his daily activities. Nevertheless the hospitalisation and medical leave is at best a rough and ready proxy for the severity of the injuries. The assessment of time for treatment of injuries and recovery depends on various factors including the opinion of the medical professional and the personal characteristics of the victim: _Tang Ling Lee_ at \[25\] and \[26\].

24     In the present case the victim suffered a left distal ulna open fracture, left forearm wounds and left upper limb wounds. The Statement of Facts stated that the victim was hospitalised for 18 days and thereafter discharged with 14 days of medical leave with various medications. The principal diagnosis in the Inpatient Discharge Summary was that the victim suffered “Fracture of the ulna, left distal ulna open fracture” and the surgical procedures he had undergone for the left ulna open fracture included forearm degloving wound debridgement and re-application of vacuum assisted closure dressing, followed by open reduction and internal fixation bone grafting. There is no evidence that the victim suffered any permanent injury.

25     Prosecution submitted that the degree of harm in this case should be considered low, and drew the court’s attention to _Shaik Farid’s_ case which involved a collision between a driver and a pedestrian in a carpark driveway. The victim suffered a closed fracture of the upper end of tibia and a closed fracture of tibia and underwent surgery. The victim was hospitalized for 20 days and given 21 days hospitalization leave. Prosecution considered this the “closest” case as the victim’s hospitalization and medical leave were similar to that of the victim in the present case.

26     The sentence of $4000 fine imposed on the accused in _Shaik Farid_ was within the presumptive sentencing range of the category 1 sentencing band applicable to cases of “lesser harm and lower culpability”. However as _Shaik Farid_ was an unreported decision we do not have the benefit of the court’s reasoning and assessment of harm and culpability.

27     I drew some guidance from the reported decisions of _Tang Ling Lee_ and _Public Prosecutor v Ong Heng Chua and another appeal_ \[2018\] 3 SLR 388 (“_Ong Heng Chua_”).

28     In _Tang Ling Lee_, the victim suffered multiple fractures in various parts of his body including his heel, foot, wrist and spine, and underwent 12 surgeries over two months. He was hospitalised for 69 days and given 180 days hospitalization leave. The court was of the view that the victim had suffered “substantial injuries”: \[6\] and \[45\].

29     In _Ong Heng Chua_, the victim suffered multiple fractures in various parts of her body – left proximal humerus fracture, left distal radius fracture and a left fibula head and Gerdy’s tubercle fracture that were treated with Open Reduction Internal Fixation. She was warded for 13 days and discharged with 32 days hospitalization leave. The court was of the view that the injuries were not very serious or permanent compared to the victim in _Tang Ling Lee_, and opined that prosecution had quite fairly taken the view that the degree of harm was moderate.

30     In the present case, the injuries suffered by the victim were far less severe than those suffered by both the victims in _Tang Ling Lee_ and _Ong Heng Chua_. The victim here had suffered a single open fracture in the left distal ulna fracture, compared to the multiple fractures suffered by the two victims in _Tang Ling Lee_ and _Ong Heng Chua._ The victim here had undergone open reduction and internal fixation surgery. Although hospitalised for a longer period of 18 days, compared to the victim in _Ong Heng Chua_ who was hospitalised for 13 days, the period of hospitalisation is only a proxy and depends on various factors aside from the seriousness of the injury. In this case age could have been a factor, as the victim was 87 years old and far more elderly that the 55-year-old motorcyclist in _Ong Heng Chua’s_ case.

31     I agreed with Prosecution’s classification of the victim’s injury as low harm in the present case. His injuries were far less severe than those of the victim in _Ong Heng Chua_ whose injuries had been classified as moderate.

### Level of Culpability is on upper end of moderate

32     The degree of culpability would generally refer to the degree of relative blameworthiness disclosed by the offender’s actions and is measured chiefly by the extent and manner of the offender’s involvement in the criminal act. Of relevance would be the manner of driving - how dangerous was the driving and the extent of the danger posed to road users by the offender’s conduct, and whether the circumstances of driving might have increased the danger posed to road users: _Tang Ling Lee_ at \[25\] \[27\] and\[28\].

33     In this case the accused was charged with endangering the personal safety of others by failing to keep a proper look-out before he executed the right turn at the T-junction in the open space carpark, and colliding into the victim who was crossing the service road from the accused’s right to left.

34     I found the video footage from the accused’s in-car camera (“the video”) graphic. It showed the following:

> (a)     The accused driving along the service road of an open space car park towards a T-junction.

> (b)     The victim is first captured on the right side of the video (12:23:42) where he is seen crossing the service road after the T-junction.

> (c)     The victim remains within the in-car camera field of vision throughout from this point.

> (d)     As the accused nears the T-junction the victim becomes clearly visible within the accused’s line of sight, as the victim continues walking across the service road from the accused’s right.

> (e)     The accused executes the right turn towards the center of the service road, without slowing down, changing course or taking any evasive action. By now the victim is almost halfway across the service road and crossing directly ahead of the accused’s intended path (12:23:44).

> (f)     The front left of the accused’s vehicle collides into the left side of the victim (12:23:45).

35     From the video, this was not a situation of a pedestrian suddenly stepping out into the path of a moving car, nor that of a pedestrian taking an unnecessary risk of crossing at the edge of the T-junction. The victim had crossed the service road about two parking lots away from the edge of the T-junction. Moreover the victim had also already made his way almost halfway across the service road before the accused collided into him.

36     The weather was fine, visibility was good and there did not appear to be other moving vehicles at the T-junction at the relevant time. The victim was visible for about three seconds before impact, time enough for the accused to slow down, change his intended path or take some evasive action. Even if the accused had not sighted the victim initially when the victim first appeared in the right corner of his field of vision, the victim was clearly visible ahead of his intended path when the accused neared the T-junction before the start of his turn. Yet the accused simply proceeded as if the victim was not there. I also observed it would have been possible for the accused to make a tighter turn to the right of the service road, instead of the broad turn he executed towards the center of the service road across the victim’s path.

37     If the accused had been keeping any sort of lookout, it was not conceivable that he could have missed seeing the victim crossing ahead of him in the path of his moving vehicle. The view ahead of the accused’s vehicle was clear and unobstructed. The inference to be drawn was that the accused was not paying any attention _at all_ to what was happening in front of him. There was no other plausible explanation for his actions.

38     The incident had occurred in a carpark, where both motorist and pedestrian movements would be expected. Visual vigilance and driving in a manner to accommodate pedestrian and motorist movements were critical aspects of a motorist’s responsibilities in such locations. Yet the accused had completely failed in his duty to keep a proper look-out. Prosecution had characterised his culpability as “moderate”. I was of the view that the accused’s neglect bordered on gross negligence, and regarded his culpability as on the upper-end of moderate. The accused had knocked down a pedestrian who was in plain sight and in broad daylight.

### Sentencing band 2 applies

39      _Tang Ling Lee_ stated that category 1 of the sentencing band of “lesser harm and lower culpability” applied to cases where culpability-increasing factors would be absent or present to a very limited extent, such that negligence was at the lowest end of the spectrum. The harm occasioned would be characterised by the lack of very serious or permanent injuries, and the harm and culpability were both at the lower end of the spectrum. The sentencing band in category 2 of “greater harm and lower culpability” or “lesser harm and higher culpability” applied to cases where harm is at the lower end of the spectrum but the culpability of the offender is moderate to high, or the harm is serious but the culpability of the offender remains low: \[31\],\[34\] and \[35\].

40     The present offence could not be considered one where the negligence was at the lowest end of the spectrum, where both harm and culpability were low, and therefore did not fall within the category 1 sentencing band.

41     As the offence has been assessed to be one of low harm and culpability to be the upper-end of moderate, it fell within the category 2 sentencing band. This attracts a presumptive sentencing range of one to two weeks’ imprisonment. As to where within the presumptive sentencing range the offence falls, I was of the view that the offence would attract a sentence at the lower end of the presumptive custodial range of around one week’s imprisonment. The accused’s negligence stemmed from his failing to keep any sort of look-out whilst executing the right turn in the carpark.

## Issue 2: Aggravating and mitigating factors and adjustments to be made to sentence

42     The accused had two 1984 previous convictions for traffic-related offences. However they were committed more than 35 years ago, and did not relate to the accused’s manner of driving or control of vehicle. I did not accord any aggravating weight to them.

43     I gave weight to the following mitigating factors raised by the accused:

> (a)     The accused had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and saved the court’s time and resources. I also accepted that he was remorseful. He had stopped to render assistance, stayed with the victim until the ambulance arrived and visited the victim several times in hospital.

> (b)     He had been driving as a career with no accidents for 20 years, and received no traffic-related demerit points for more than 10 years.

44     As for financial hardship resulting from the accused being the sole breadwinner and driving being the only career he knows, this was not a valid mitigating factor unless the circumstances are exceptional: _Lai Oei Mui Jenny v Public Prosecutor_ \[1993\]2SLR (R) 406. The accused had not raised anything to suggest that his circumstances were exceptional.

### Custodial sentence not warranted

45     Taking into account the mitigating factors including his relatively good driving record, the present offence though serious appeared to be uncharacteristic of the accused. All things considered, I was of the view that the offence did not warrant a custodial sentence, and agreed with Prosecution that a sentence of fine with disqualification was appropriate.

## Issue 3: The appropriate sentence to be imposed

### Sentencing precedents post Tang Ling Lee

46     Prosecution’s sentencing table comprised three unreported cases post _Tang Ling Lee_. Prosecution referred only to the second case _Shaik Farid_ and submitted on the injuries the victim suffered in that case, which they considered to be the closest to the present offence.

47     The first case _PP v Wang Miao_ (MAC-902943-2019) involved an accused lorry-driver who was making a right turn into Jurong Cold Store. He had stopped briefly to observe oncoming traffic from the opposite direction but failed to keep a proper look-out. The victim a motorcyclist was riding from the opposite direction and had right of way. The accused executed the turn and encroached into the victim’s path. The collision caused the victim to suffer a closed right radial head non-displaced fracture, head injury with loss of consciousness and a closed distal shaft of humerus displaced fracture requiring surgery. He was hospitalised for 4 days and given 96 days medical leave.

48     The second case _Shaik Farid_ involved a motorist exiting a carpark driveway to make a right turn into Lorong Geylang 1. He stopped briefly on the driveway to keep a look out. However he failed to keep a proper look out and failed to notice the victim, a pedestrian crossing the driveway from the accused’s right to left. The front right of the accused’s car collided into the victim, who suffered a closed fracture of upper end of tibia, and a closed fracture of tibia. The victim underwent surgery for one of the fractures, was hospitalised 20 days and given hospitalisation leave for 21 days.

49     In the third case _PP v Sim Ghim Song Kelvin_ (MAC-908913-2019) (“_Sim Ghim Song Kelvin_”) the accused was a motorist driving on the KPE, who was looking at his rear-view mirror at a car travelling close behind him. He failed to keep a proper look out for vehicles ahead of him, and could not brake in time and collided into the rear of a motorcyclist in front of him. The motorcyclist suffered abrasions and was given 3 days medical leave. The pillion rider suffered a T4 thoracic spine compression fracture, a right distal radius fracture and multiple abrasions on both hands, knees and left cheek. She underwent surgery for the T4 compression fracture and was hospitalised for 28 days, and discharged with 14 days hospitalisation leave.

50     The three precedents being unreported decisions had limited value, as the court’s assessment in each case would be fact-specific and the factors that weighed with the court in reaching its decision was unknown. However on a generalised level, the three cases involved the commonality of an accused person who had pleaded guilty, was untraced and was negligent in failing to keep a proper look-out whilst operating their motor-vehicles.

51     The three cases encompassed a wide factual spectrum – _Wang Miao_ involved a lorry-driver executing a right turn who encroached into the path of a motorcyclist coming from the opposite direction, _Shaik Farid_ involved a collision in a carpark between a motorist who collided into a pedestrian crossing from his right to left, and _Sim Ghim Song Kelvin_ involved a motorist who rear-ended a motorcyclist on the KPE. The severity of the injuries suffered by the victims in the three cases also varied. I observed that of the three cases, the pillion rider in _Sim Ghim Song Kelvin_ suffered the most severe injuries, and her injuries were also more severe than that suffered by the victim in the present case. I agreed with Prosecution that the injuries suffered by the victim in the present case was closest to the injuries suffered by the victim in _Shaik Farid’s_ case where victim suffered two fractures in the left shin. Apart from that, on a broad-based factual level the _Shaik Farid_ collision similarly occurred in a carpark between a motorist and a pedestrian, and was the most factually similar to the present offence.

### Disqualification should be ordered for s338(b) road traffic cases

52     An appropriate period of disqualification should be ordered for 338(b) road traffic offences: _Tang Ling Lee_ at \[33\].

53     In _Edwin s\\ Suse Nathan v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 4 SLR 1139</span> (“_Edwin Suse Nathan_”) which involved an accused facing a drink-driving charge, the court discussed the sentencing objectives of a disqualification order. A disqualification order combines the three sentencing objectives of punishment, protection of the public and deterrence. The two components of a sentence of fine\\jail and disqualification are not mutually compensatory. A disqualification order should therefore increase in tandem with the severity of the offence: \[13\] and \[14\].

54     The court in _Ong Heng Chua_ affirmed that the sentencing principles enunciated on disqualification orders in _Edwin Suse Nathan_ are applicable to all categories of traffic cases where disqualification is considered. The court further opined that the most important sentencing principles engaged in disqualification orders are the protection of society and deterrence. Therefore greater weight should be placed on the culpability of the offender and his driving record, which reflect on how much of a danger the accused poses to the public and indicates the degree of specific deterrence necessary: \[60\] and \[61\]

### Appropriate fine quantum and disqualification period

55     Disqualification orders impact accused persons in different ways. The accused said that driving was his only career and he was the sole breadwinner. Without doubt a disqualification order has a direct financial impact on an accused who drives for a living. However it would not be a proper basis for differentiating the length of an appropriate disqualification order to be imposed on the basis of whether an accused person drives for a living, or not. In fact, in the case of an accused who drives for a living, there is all the more reason that he should drive safety, and it is therefore all the more necessary to ensure that the period of disqualification achieves the sentencing objectives of deterrence, protection of the public and punishment.

56     In the three unreported cases cited by Prosecution, despite the differences in factual matrices of the collisions and the severity of injuries suffered by the victims, all three accused persons were sentenced to fines of $4000. The accused person in the first two cases _Wang Miao_ and _Shaik Farid_ were also sentenced to disqualification of 12 months, while the accused in the third case _Sim Ghim Song Kelvin_ where the pillion rider suffered the most severe injuries of the three cases, was disqualified 24 months.

57     In this case I had assessed the accused’s culpability as being on the upper-end of moderate while the injuries suffered by the victim were of relatively low harm. I had also given due weight to the accused’s good driving record, guilty plea, remorse and rendering of assistance. While the accused had not kept any sort of look-out as compared to the accused persons in _Wang Miao_ and _Shaik Farid_ who had stopped briefly to keep a look-out but failed to do it properly, overall I did not view the offence here as any more or less egregious than the offences committed in any of the three unreported cases cited by Prosecution, where the accused had each been fined $4000. As for the disqualification period, I was of the view that in this case a disqualification period of 12 months would suffice to meet the objectives of the sentencing principles of protection of the public, deterrence, and punishment.

## Conclusion

58     All things considered I was of the view that the appropriate sentence was a $4000 fine (in default two weeks imprisonment) and a 12-month disqualification order from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences, and I sentenced the accused accordingly.
