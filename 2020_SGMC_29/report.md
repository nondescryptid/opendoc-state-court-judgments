Civil Procedure – Costs – Taxation – Non-contentious business

20 May 2020 - Judgment reserved.

### Deputy Registrar Patrick Tay Wei Sheng:

1       The applicant is a solicitor of 39 years standing. He was instructed by the respondent (the “seller”) in two ultimately unsuccessful attempts to sell a business at a price of up to $780,000. He rendered a separate bill in respect of each attempt. Following some delay, the seller paid the bill for the first attempt and asked to have the bill for the second attempt taxed. The applicant now presents a bill of costs in the following sums for the taxation of his solicitor-and-client costs in respect of the second attempt:

> (a)     $12,500 for work done other than for taxation (“Section 1”);

> (b)     $1,250 for work done for taxation (“Section 2”); and

> (c)     $281 for disbursements (“Section 3”).

2       The seller disputes the bill and contends that the sums should be $3,000 for Section 1 and $61 for Section 3, with no award made for Section 2. He argues that the applicant did not document the work done for the second attempt, and that the work done simply duplicated that for the first attempt. He adds that the bill relates to work that “pre-dates” the signing of the warrant to act for the second attempt (“WTA”).

3       Neither party filed any affidavit in support of their positions in this taxation. Rather, they agreed to proceed on their written submissions and the documents that they exhibited therein. Neither party raised any objections as to the authenticity of those documents.

## Formalities

4       The WTA sets out the agreement of the seller as follows:[^1]

> … I conﬁrm and agree that your fee for so acting for me in this matter \[_ie_, the second attempt\] shall be ﬁxed at $15,000.00 plus all reasonable disbursements (including stamp and search fees) to be incurred by you on my behalf

>> Dated this 5th day of January 2017

5       It does not assist the seller that the WTA was signed only after the applicant had commenced work on the second attempt. An agreement for the remuneration of a solicitor for non-contentious business may be made “before or after or in the course of the transaction of any non-contentious business” (s 109(1) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed) (“LPA”)). The WTA fulfils the formalities requirements of s 109(4) of the LPA: it is in writing and signed by the seller. It is also undisputed that the seller had prior to executing the WTA instructed the applicant orally, and that the WTA had been executed in the terms of that instruction. On its face, the WTA is thus enforceable as a remuneration agreement (see _Law Society of Singapore v Ang Chin Peng and another_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 1 SLR 946</span> at \[29\]).

## Fairness and reasonableness

6       Nevertheless, the court has a broad jurisdiction over a bill of costs for non-contentious business that is based on a remuneration agreement. Where the amount claimed is unfair or unreasonable relative to the work done, the court may cancel the remuneration agreement or reduce the amount payable thereunder (s 109(6) of the LPA). The guiding principle is that a solicitor “must charge the client fairly for work done” (r 17(1) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (No. S 706); see also _Jemma Trust Co Ltd v Liptrott_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 1 WLR 646</span>).

7       The rationale for such judicial supervision over non-contentious business is that the client may not understand the nature and extent of the work undertaken on the matter. The taxing officer is an independent reviewer of the remuneration agreement that forms the basis of the bill of costs (_Law Society of Singapore v Ang Chin Peng and another_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 1 SLR 946</span> at \[34\]).

> … it is only the Solicitor, and not the client, who fully appreciates the nature and extent of the work to be undertaken on the matter. The Solicitor thus enjoys an advantage and it would be unfair to the client to be straitjacketed, without any available recourse, to the fee agreement. Understandably therefore, this provision permits the client to have the agreement reviewed by an independent person, ie, the taxing officer of the court. In every instance, the Solicitor must satisfy the test of fairness or reasonableness of the amount charged in relation to the services rendered.

8       The Legal Profession (Solicitors’ Remuneration) Order (Cap 161, O 1, 2010 Rev Ed) (“LP(SR)O”) sets out a list of factors that go to the fairness and reasonableness of the remuneration of a solicitor for non-contentious business:

> **Non-contentious business**

> **2**.    The remuneration of a solicitor in respect of business other than contentious business shall be such sum as is fair and reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the case, and in particular the following circumstances:

>> (a)    the importance of the matter to the client;

>> (b)    the skill, labour, specialised knowledge and responsibility involved on the part of the solicitor;

>> (c)    the complexity of the matter and the difficulty or novelty of the question raised;

>> (d)    where money or property is involved, the amount or value thereof;

>> (e)    the time expended by the solicitor;

>> (f)    the number and importance of the documents prepared or perused, without regard to length; and

>> (g)    the place where, and the circumstances under which, the services or business or any part thereof are rendered or transacted.

9       These factors are not unlike the general factors considered in a taxation under Appendix 1 to O 59 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”). But the LP(SR)O places special emphasis on the factor of urgency, and permits a solicitor to charge additional remuneration for special exertion for business that is carried through in an exceptionally short space of time:

> **Additional remuneration for special exertion**

> **3**.    In respect of any business which is required to be, and is, by special exertion, carried through in an exceptionally short space of time, a solicitor may charge additional remuneration for the special exertion according to the circumstances.

10     In my view, the $12,500 claimed by the applicant for Section 1 is neither unfair nor unreasonable. The value of the transaction was large, with the seller pricing his business at between $600,000 and $780,000.[^2] The matter was also of critical importance to the seller, who needed the funds from the sale of the business to pay, _inter alia_, the Housing & Development Board (“HDB”), which was pursuing him for rental arrears.[^3] Finally, there was urgency in the sale of the business for the seller, who had asked the applicant to “expedite” the sale.[^4]

### Documentation

11     The seller complains that there is little documentation of the work done. But the applicant has produced a set of file notes dated between 7 September 2016 and 27 March 2017 (“Notes”),[^5] corresponding to the timeframe of the second attempt. The Notes detail the instructions of the seller, the negotiations between the seller and the potential buyer of the business, and the work that the applicant had done on the transaction. Brief and disorderly as the Notes may be, their brevity and disorder are consistent with their handwritten and contemporaneous nature. There is also no suggestion that the Notes are inauthentic.

12     More importantly, the seller does not allege that the work as detailed in the Notes had not been done. Nor does the seller contend that the work done had been inadequate or unsatisfactory. Indeed, the seller signed the WTA, which provides for remuneration of $15,000 (excluding disbursements) in respect of the second attempt on 5 January 2017, four months after the work started on the second attempt.

13     An issue with documentation of work done goes only to the proof of the work done and not the work itself. Even today, when the seller has instructed new solicitors for these taxation proceedings, the seller does not dispute the quality of any part of the _substantive_ work performed in the second attempt. Without more, I do not think the fees claimed are unreasonable or unfair.

### Duplication

14     The seller complains also that the work done in the second attempt substantially duplicates of the work done in the first attempt. He points to the “largely similar” language of the sale-and-purchase agreement (“SPA”) drafted by the applicant for each of the first attempt and the second attempt,[^6] and submits that the fees for the second attempt should be no more than $3,000.

15     The $15,000 agreed between the parties for the second attempt, as set out in the WTA, is identical to the $15,000 agreed between them for the first attempt. However, the applicant agreed to reduce his fees for the second attempt to $10,000 after it fell through,[^7] even as he now claims $12,500 in this taxation. A solicitor is entitled to present a bill of costs for taxation that is higher than that previously presented to the client and with which the client is dissatisfied (O 59 r 28(4) of the ROC; see also _Lau Liat Meng & Co v Lum Kai Keng_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 3 SLR(R) 123</span> at \[11\]).

16     In my view, any similarity in the language of the SPA in the second attempt to that of the SPA in the first attempt sheds little light on the work done in each attempt. The SPA for the second attempt was prepared in or around September 2016, almost two years after the SPA for the first attempt was prepared (in December 2014). The applicant had to re-acquaint and update himself with the business that was the subject of the sale. Moreover, the applicant represented the seller in the negotiations with the buyer in the second attempt and assisted with the repeated due diligence requests made by the buyer. The language of the SPAs shed no light on the work done for the purpose of such representation. There were at least four significant areas of divergence between the parties on which the applicant had to work. First, the sale price: the seller sought $600,000 while the buyer offered only $500,000 and subsequently sought to reduce the price further on account of deficiencies in the records of the business. Second, the payment timelines: the seller sought full payment within 3 months of the sale while the buyer sought to a payment period of 12 months. Third, the management and control arrangements: the buyer wanted to be appointed as a director of the business upon paying 5% of the purchase price. Fourth, the due diligence process: the seller failed, even after repeated reminders and advice from the applicant, to supply important records on the business. All these matters are unique to the second attempt, and do not duplicate the work done in the first attempt.

17     The due diligence records that the applicant had to repeatedly remind the seller to provide concern many aspects of the business and include the following: (a) the signed accounts of the business; (b) the tenancy agreement for the premises leased by the business; (c) the renewal notice for an important trademark of the business; (d) the statement of accounts for the hire-purchase of a vehicle used by the business; and (e) the notices of renewal of two licences for the manufacturing operations of the business.[^8] The Notes also reflect that the seller had been “unhappy and uncooperative” with these requests for records,[^9] and that the buyer had sought an extension of the payment timelines due to the delay by the seller in providing the records.[^10] This was even as the seller directed the applicant to “expedite” the transaction.[^11] Indeed, the eventual decision of the buyer to abort the transaction also appears to have been motivated by this dearth of records on the business.[^12]

18     Further, even as the applicant was facilitating negotiations between the seller and the buyer, the applicant also had to assist the seller to file a request with the HDB for an extension of time to pay his rental arrears.[^13] This work was certainly not duplicative of that done in the first attempt.

19     Finally, based on the documents exhibited by the parties, the seller complained about the work done in the second attempt only belatedly. The first time that the seller so complained was at or just before 1 October 2019,[^14] when, through his present solicitors, he asked for a taxation of the costs for the second attempt. By April 2017, the second attempt had fallen through. Yet, even as late as in March 2019, when the applicant invoiced the seller in respect of the second attempt,[^15] the seller did not appear to have taken issue with the work done. Ultimately, the dissatisfaction of the seller lies more about his inability to sell the business than in the quality of the work done by the applicant in pursuit of that sale.

## Conclusion

20     I tax Section 1 at $12,500, as drawn up by the applicant.

21     For Section 2, this was a hotly contested taxation that involved a half-day hearing. Both parties also filed written submissions. In the premises, I tax Section 2 at $1,000.

22     For Section 3, the applicant seeks a total of $281. This bulk of this sum is $121 of filing fees and $150 in “transport charges, photocopying charges and other incidentals”. In my view, $100 would be a fair and reasonable sum for “transport, photocopying, and other incidentals”. I thus tax Section 3 at $231.
