## Statement of Facts

4       The accused admitted to the following Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification.

**FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 1ST AND 2ND CHARGES (DAC-925819-2018 AND MAC-907372-2018)**

> 1.    The accused is Shaun Joshua Koh Shun Heng, a 33-year-old Singaporean male (date of birth: 31 December 1985), holding the NRIC bearing no. SXXX. At the material time of the offence, the accused was working as a Behavioral Therapist.

> 2.    The victim is Ong Jing Wei, a 28-year-old male. At the material time of the offence, the victim was:

>> a.    a police officer;

>> b.    holding the rank of Sergeant;

>> c.    a public servant;

>> d.    attached to Bukit Merah West Neighbourhood Police Centre;

>> e.    on patrol duty;

>> f.    wearing his police uniform; and

>> g.    he was a public servant in the execution of his duty as such public servant.

> 3.    At the material time of the offence, the victim was patrolling St James Power Station located at 3 Sentosa Gateway, Singapore, with two police officers (collectively, “the police officers”). The witness is Tan Hui Ying (“the fiancée”), a 27-year-old female. At the material time of the offence, she was the fiancée of the accused.

> 4.    Investigations revealed that, on 20 October 2017 at about 10.45 p.m., the accused, the fiancée and five friends visited various clubs at St James Power Station and consumed alcohol. They drank till about 4.30 a.m. on 21 October 2017. At this time, three of their friends had left.

> 5.    The accused, the fiancée and two friends were downstairs “Club 2” at St James Power Station and intending to head home. However, the accused and the fiancée got into an argument. After shouting and scolding the fiancée, the accused walked off alone. The accused’s fiancée and two friends intended to leave and were walking outside the entrance of “Club Molecule” at St James Power Station when they were spot checked by the police officers.

> 6.    While the police officers were interviewing and checking the particulars of the accused’s fiancée and two friends, the accused walked towards them and grabbed the fiancée’s hand and pulled her away shouting “fuck you. Let’s go!”. One of the police officers shouted “Oi” at the accused who was walking away and pulling his fiancée along. The accused shouted back “Catch me to the police station then! Fuck you!”. As the accused and his fiancée were walking towards the carpark, the accused could be heard shouting “I don’t give a shit. Let’s go home!”.

> 7.    The police officers chased after the accused and his fiancée. The police officers caught up with the accused and his fiancée from behind. While placing the accused under arrest in the vicinity of “Club Molecule” located at St James Power Station, the accused struggled with the police officers. When the victim tried to handcuff the accused, the accused bit the victim on his left forearm.

> 8.    The police officers eventually managed to place the accused under arrest and escorted him to Central Police Division.

> 9.    Later that same day, at 6.18am, the victim sought medical treatment at the Department of Emergency Medicine at Singapore General Hospital (“SGH”) for his injuries caused by the accused. The medical report dated 26 October 2017 prepared by Dr Shen Yuzeng, Associate Consultant of the said department stated that:

>> a.    the victim was given tetanus vaccine;

>> b.    the victim was started on a course of oral antibiotics and Human Immuno deficiency Virus (HIV) prophylaxis;

>> c.    Blood tests for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV screen, liver panel, renal panel and full blood count was done;

>> d.    the victim was given a memo for early review at the Infectious Diseases clinic;

>> e.    the victim was given outpatient medical leave for 1 day on 21 October 2017; and

>> f.    the victim was diagnosed with a human-bite wound.

> 10.    The accused was examined by Dr Marc Ong at 10pm on 21 October 2017. Dr Kang Jun Hui Larry from Healthway Medical Group Pte Ltd prepared a medical report dated 12 December 2017 stating that the accused was noted to be well and had no fresh injuries and a blood sample was obtained from the accused to determine his blood alcohol level.

> 11.    The accused’s blood sample was sealed “GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE” and marked “SHAUN JOSHUA KOH SHUN HENG SXXX” and submitted to the Health Sciences Authority on 31 October 2017 at 11.48am for analysis. Leong Hsiao Tung, an analyst with the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of the HSA prepared a report bearing “Lab No.: TX-1731-06883” dated 2 November 2017 under s 263 of the Criminal Procedure stating that, on analysis, the accused’s blood sample was found to contain 107mg of ethanol per 100ml of blood.

> 12.    By voluntarily causing hurt to the victim, a police officer, being a public servant in the discharge of his duty as such public servant, _to wit_, by biting the said Sergeant Ong Jing Wei’s left forearm, causing him to sustain a human-bite wound, the accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 332 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> 13.    By behaving in a disorderly manner, _to wit_, by repeatedly shouting in the vicinity of “Club Molecule” located at 3 Sentosa Gateway, Singapore, which is a public place, the accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 20 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order & Nuisance) Act (Cap 284, 1997 Rev Ed).

> 14.    The accused stands charged accordingly.

5       As part of the SOF, the prosecution admitted the video footage recorded from the victim’s body-worn-camera in order to give the court a complete and accurate understanding of the circumstances that led to the commission of the offence. The said video footage lasted slightly less than 2 minutes. While it did not capture the biting incident, the background shouting was captured and it was during this period where the accused bit the victim.

## Antecedents

7       The accused is untraced.

## Prosecution’s Submission on Sentence

8       The prosecution submitted for a sentence of at least six months’ imprisonment for the section 332 Penal charge. As for the 2nd charge of disorderly behaviour, the prosecution left the sentence to the court. In respect of this appeal brought by the prosecution, it is only against the sentence of four months’ imprisonment imposed for the 1st charge under section 332 of the Penal Code.

9       The learned DPP tendered a table of sentencing precedents where the accused persons have pleaded guilty to similar charge under section 332 of the Penal Code where it involved biting a police officer in the course of resisting an arrest. She highlighted several aggravating factors. First, the accused had bitten the victim and there is a potential harm and risk of transmission of infectious diseases. Secondly, the accused’s actions demonstrated contempt for the police officers and their authority. The accuse dragged his fiancée away and continued to shout vulgarities and refused to calm down despite being told multiple times. Third, the incident occurred in a public area and in full view of members of the public.

10     The prosecution submitted that this case fell within Category 2 of the case of _PP v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1080</span> (“_Jeffrey Yeo_”) under lesser harm and higher culpability as there are three aggravating factors present, and that only slight harm was occasioned in this instance.

## Mitigation

11     The learned counsel for the accused submitted for a minimal custodial sentence of up to three months’ imprisonment for the 1st charge and a fine of up to $500 for the 2nd charge. In respect of the 1st charge, the defence submitted that the aims of general deterrence and retribution would be met with a short imprisonment term as this was a one-off incident as a result of him being drunk due to stress as his parents were going through a highly acrimonious and painful divorce that affected him badly.

12     The accused had been a law-abiding citizen and the incident was completely out-of-character of the accused. He is deeply remorseful for his offence and had repeatedly apologized to the officer after being told that he had bitten the victim.

13     The learned counsel highlighted that the accused had pulled his fiancée away from police officers and walked hurriedly away and did not know that the officer had chased after them and pushed the accused to the ground to arrest him. The accused did not know that he was being placed under arrest and hence, responded by struggling and he bit the officer once without excessive force. At that time, there were only a few persons in the vicinity.

14     In support of the accused’s good character, the learned counsel submitted copies of testimonials for the accused’s frequent voluntary and community work. As a behavioural therapist specialising in dealing with autistic children, he had volunteered at aLife Limited between 2015 to 2017. He is also an active member of his church as an Extraordinary Minister of Communion, and in the prayer groups.

15     Relying on the case of _Jeffrey Yeo_, his learned counsel submitted that this was a case where the bite was not severe as it was a single bite committed on the spur of the moment. Further, the bite was brief and not with such great force, and did not cause the skin to be broken. The accused also did not bite at a private or sensitive part of the body. Hence, the learned counsel submitted that it should be in Category 1, i.e. low degree of harm and low degree of culpability.

16     The learned counsel also cited the cases of _PP v He Yan_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 88</span> and _PP v Wan Li_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 1</span>, where the offenders in these two cases were sentenced to five months’ imprisonment and 15 weeks’ imprisonment respectively for biting a police officer. The learned counsel submitted that the facts and circumstances of those cases revealed that the offenders were more violent and aggressive, and hence were more aggravated in comparison to the present case.

17     In the course of the mitigation, the accused and his fiancée (and now his wife) pleaded the court for a second chance and to spare the accused from incarceration so that he could continue his passion to work with children with special needs and to contribute back to society.

## Reasons for the Sentence Imposed

#### The Principle of Deterrence

18     In deciding on the appropriate sentence to impose, I took into account the accused’s guilty plea and the mitigation plea submitted on his behalf by his learned counsel. I also considered the accused and his wife’s personal mitigation plea to the court to give the accused a second chance, and not to impose a custodial sentence.

19     However, the court is guided by the landmark case of _Jeffrey Yeo_, decided by the High Court comprising of Three Judges, as well as the applicable sentencing framework and sentencing considerations. The case of _Jeffrey Yeo_ clearly indicated that in most cases of section 332 involving an assault against a public servant, in this case, a police officer, the custody threshold is usually crossed and a custodial sentence is warranted. In other words, one can expect to receive an imprisonment term following an assault of a police officer.

20     As stated at paragraph 50 of the judgment, police officers must be assured of adequate protection and vindication by the law against behaviour that might compromise the effective discharge of their duties. In that light, the High Court formulated a sentencing framework for a section 332 offence to reflect society’s opprobrium of such cases, and to aid the lower courts in sentencing in such cases and help maintain uniformity in the sentences.

21     The said framework applied to cases of causing hurt to police officers and public servants who are performing duties akin to police duties. The sentencing band for Category 1 (i.e. lesser harm and lower culpability circumstances) encompassed the existing sentencing norm of two to nine months’ imprisonment. The High Court stated that this would remain the indicative starting point for most cases involving causing hurt to police officers. Fines should be meted out only in very exceptional cases, where the offending act ranks the lowest in the harm-and-culpability spectrum.

22     Quite clearly, the principle of deterrence, both general and specific deterrence, must be the predominant sentencing consideration in such cases, and save in very exceptional circumstances, a fine would clearly be inappropriate. The court must send a clear signal that assault on public servants and police officers while in the discharge of their duties would not be tolerated. There is clearly a public interest to ensure that police officers will be protected adequately by the law that they uphold. Furthermore, incidents of assaults against police officers are also an attack on their authority. If left unchecked, it could seriously undermine the public confidence in our police officers, and compromise their effectiveness in maintaining law and order.

23     Having regard to the sentencing framework laid down by _Jeffrey Yeo_, I was not able to accede to the personal request of the accused and his wife to impose a non-custodial sentence. The question to be considered was the appropriate length of imprisonment term to impose in this case.

24     In deciding on the appropriate length of imprisonment term to impose, I considered the sentencing precedents cited by the prosecution in support for a sentence of at least six months’ imprisonment. Having carefully considered these unreported cases, I formed the viewed that these cases where the offenders received six months’ imprisonment for the section 332 Penal Code charge, were clearly more egregious than the present case before me.

25     First, the accused persons in _PP v Mohamad Aris s/o Anwar Ali_, _PP v Mohamed Zulkifli bin Abu Bakar_, and _PP v Ramlan bin Misrop_ were all traced and they were not first offenders. It was also clear that the offenders in these cases had behaved aggressively, tried to flee from the police, and put up a violent struggle to evade being arrested for either serious drug offences or Customs offences.

26     Suffice to note, the offender _Mohamed Zulkifli_ was wanted by the CNB at the material time of the offence, likewise for _Mohamad Aris_, as he tried to flee after attempting to throw away a small black colour plastic packet from is pocket. The offender _Ramlan_ was found to be possession of controlled drugs and drug paraphernalia after his subsequent arrest. Hence, quite apart from the fact that these offenders were not first-time offenders, the facts also revealed that they put up a violent struggle in order to avoid being apprehended for having committed more serious offences.

27     In _PP v Nguyen Van Binh_, the offender put up a struggle and bit the Customs officer to evade arrest for Customs-related offences (duty unpaid cigarettes). Similarly, in _PP v Hoang Van Chuan_, the offender was selling contraband cigarettes by the roadside and put a struggle in resisting arrest and in the course of the arrest, the accused bit one officer on the arm and another on the chest.

28     Finally, in _PP v Govinda Raj s/o Thevadass_, the offender had elbowed one police officer at this lower ribcage, uttered vulgarities, spat at another officer and bit his thumb. He had to be pinned down in the police vehicle and upon reaching the police HQ, three officers had to carry him to the holding room. The offender had antecedents for, _inter alia_, voluntarily causing hurt where he was placed on probation.

29     Unlike these cases cited by the prosecution, I note that the accused was not evading police arrest because he was a wanted person or that he committed other any other offences, other than the proceeded two charges. The SOF revealed that while the police officers were conducting a spot check on the accused’s fiancée and his friends, he merely walked towards them and pulled his fiancée away towards the car park. It was only when the police officers caught up with the accused and his fiancée from behind that he struggled with the police officers when he was placed under arrest. When the victim tried to handcuff the accused, the accused bit him on the left forearm.

30     Hence, the facts and circumstances leading to the accused’s arrest and the accused biting the police officer on the left forearm were quite different in character and gravity as compared to the unreported cases cited by the prosecution.

31     I next considered the more recent cases in 2019 cited by the learned defence counsel, namely _PP v Wan Li_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 1</span> and _PP v He Yan_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 88</span>. In sentencing the offender to 15 weeks’ imprisonment, the court in _Wan Li_ noted that the offender only inflicted a single bite wound which did not leave any permanent injury on the victim. Further the offender was in a confused state of mind, and being new to Singapore and in an unfamiliar setting while he was restrained in IMH for further mental assessment. The offence also did not occur in public view.

32     I further note that the court in _Wan Li_ did not agree with the prosecution’s submission to simply disregard the sentence of four months’ imprisonment that were sought by the prosecution in the unreported case of _PP v Ler Xin Chyi Benjamin_ (DAC 931911/2017 & Others) which was decided on 5th September 2018. At paragraph 18 of the judgement, the court noted that in that case, the offender was intoxicated after his drinks with his friends at a club. He was picked up by a taxi driver and upon arrival at his destination, the offender got out of the taxi and laid on the pavement beside the taxi without paying his fare. When police assistance was called, the police officers tried to lift up the offender, who got agitated, put up a struggle and shouted at the officers. The offender then bit one of the police officers on his right wrist twice resulting in the victim being given two days of medical leave.

33     The court was of the view that relevant cases of offenders who bit enforcement officers under section 332 of the Penal Code still served as useful sentencing precedents to assist the court in arriving at the appropriate sentence whether they pre-date or post-date _Jeffrey Yeo_. The prosecution appealed against the sentence of 15 weeks’ imprisonment and the appeal (MA 9355/2018/01) was dismissed by the High Court.

34     In _He Yan_, the offender was uncooperative and resisted arrest when the police raided a flat for suspected vice activities and found a group of women therein. The court considered that the accused’s aggression was not confined to only one officer. She was violent and resisted arrest for suspected vice activities by trying to kick at another officer and then tried to bite a second officer. The court found that the offender’s behaviour was plainly disdainful and contemptuous of police authority and should be adequately punished.

35     The prosecution in that case submitted for an imprisonment sentence of at least six months. The prosecution submitted a table listing out 21 sentencing precedents post-_Jeffrey Yeo_ in support of the prosecution’s sentencing position. The court observed that the precedents showed that a custodial sentence of between five to six months was generally the usual sentence imposed for biting a police officer in the course of resisting arrest, and that the sentence imposed for three cases was four months’ imprisonment which was not very much less than the norm. The court decided that a starting sentence of five months’ imprisonment would be appropriate in that case.

36     As emphasized by the Court of Three Judges in _Jeffrey Yeo_, given the factually diverse ways in which offences under section 332 present themselves, it is not possible to identify exhaustively the features of cases for which particular types or lengths of sentences will be appropriate. The appropriate sentence will always be the product of a fact-sensitive and sensible exercise of discretion.

37     Turning to the present case, while I accept the prosecution’s submission that the accused was intoxicated at the time of the offence and the incident occurred in public, and that these would be considered as aggravating factors, I also considered the accused’s personal mitigating factors.

38     In this respect, I note that at the material time, the accused was struggling to come to terms with the painful divorce of his parents, which drove his mother into depression. The accused also started on a new job and had a tiff with his then fiancée and drowned his sorrows in alcohol. He has since sought professional counselling from a psychologist to help him get over his parent’s divorce.

39     I observed that the accused was extremely remorseful for his actions, and my view if further fortified by the accused’s decision to accept the punishment, and not to be released on bail pending appeal. In this regard, he indicated that he would be prepared to serve the enhanced period of his sentence in the event that he completed serving his original sentence by the time the appeal was heard and the prosecution’s appeal was allowed.

40     Having considered the testimonials submitted on his behalf in the mitigation plea, I accept that the accused is generally a person of good character, having frequently involved himself in voluntary and community work, in particular, his contribution to the special needs children and to his church. While there remained a need to impose a custodial sentence as a general deterrence, I accept that this was genuinely a one-off incident, and the accused had acted entirely out of character. To that extent, I was of the view that it did not require the court to impose a strong specific deterrence against the accused.

41     After carefully studying the cases cited by both the prosecution and the defence, I did not agree with the prosecution’s submission for a sentence of six months’ imprisonment. While I agreed with the defence’s submission that many of the cases cited by the prosecution were more egregious than the present case, I also did not agree with the defence’s submission that the sentence should not be longer than three months’ imprisonment as that would fall outside the range of sentences imposed for such cases.

42     In the final analysis, having regard to all the facts and circumstances of the case, and the injuries caused from the single bite by the accused to the police officer, I decided that a sentence of four months’ imprisonment would be an appropriate sentence to impose, and would serve the ends of justice. In my view, the sentence is clearly within the sentencing range of between 15 weeks’ and six months’ imprisonment imposed for an offence of voluntarily causing hurt by biting a police officer.

43     The prosecution being dissatisfied with the sentence has appealed against the sentence.

44     At the time of writing my Grounds of Decision, the accused is serving his sentence.
