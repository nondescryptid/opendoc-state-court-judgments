22 May 2019

### District Judge Shaiffudin Bin Saruwan:

## INTRODUCTION

The Accused, a 55 years old male Chinese, faced 37 charges under s 22B(1) read with s 23 of the Employment of Foreign Workers Act (EFMA), Chapter 91A, and punishable under s 22B(1) of the same Act. The offences were for engaging in a conspiracy with others to obtain work passes for foreign employees for a business that did not require the employment of such foreign employees.

2       The Accused initially claimed trial to the charges. Midway through the trial, he decided to plead guilty to 16 charges and consented to have the remaining 21 charges be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing (“TIC”).

## THE FACTS

3       The 16 proceeded charges committed by the Accused could be split into three categories – (i) the Hong Kong Street charges, (ii) the Home Eatery charges, and (iii) the Royal Success charges.

### The Hong Kong Street Charges

### Background Facts

4       Sometime before 1 Jan 14, the Accused, who was then an undischarged bankrupt, asked one Guay Boon Chwee (“Boon Chwee”), to register a company. The company would be used to sell its work permit quotas to other companies that needed them. It would obtain work permits for foreign workers but they would not be employed by the company. Instead, they would be employed by these other companies. Boon Chwee was promised $1000/- a month for his participation.

5       On 1 Jan 14, Boon Chwee registered Hong Kong Street Holding Pte Ltd (“HKSPL”) with him as the registered director. From 1 Aug 14, HKSPL in turn owned Hong Kong Street F&B (“HKS”).

6       Sometime in February 2014, one Low Suk Sien (“Catherine”) who ran two food stalls wanted to employ foreign workers. As she did not have any foreign worker quota, she sought the Accused’s help. He agreed to help for a fee of $1,000/- for each worker. Catherine would pay the monthly levies for the workers.

7       Sometime in August 2014, the Accused roped in his wife, Tan Chin Hwee (“Chin Hwee”) to help as he was due to serve an imprisonment sentence for some income tax offences. From then on, Chin Hwee liaised with Catherine on matters relating to the application or cancellation of work permits of foreign workers required by Catherine. Chin Hwee also collected payment from Catherine. She also paid Boon Chwee his agreed cut.

### Facts relating to MAC 909179-80/16

8       On or about 26 Nov and 8 Dec 14, Catherine provided the particulars of two foreigners to Chin Hwee for the application of work permits for them to work at her stalls. Chin Hwee used Boon Chwee’s Singpass account to apply for the work permits online via the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) website. The applications declared that the two foreigners would be employed as cooks with HKS. The forms were signed by Boon Chwee as director. At all times, Chin Hwee and Boon Chwee knew that the two foreigners were not going to be employed by HKS.

9       The applications forms were approved on 26 Nov 14 and 8 Dec 14. The two foreigners were issued with work permits under HKS. They were never employed by HKS. Instead they worked for Catherine at her food stall. Catherine had no business relationship with HKS.

### Facts relating to MAC 909181-82/16

10     On or about 12 Aug 14, Catherine furnished Chin Hwee with the particulars of two foreigners. At that time, they were already working at Catherine’s food stall. She wanted to continue employing them. Chin Hwee made the work permit applications using the same methodology at \[8\] above. The two applications were approved on 13 Aug 14. Both foreigners were issued with work permits under HKS. But they were never employed by HKS. Instead they worked for Catherine at her stall.

11     Catherine paid Chin Hwee $1,000/- for each of the four foreigners. She also paid $1,200/- levy every month for each foreigner. After deducting the levy payable and the cut given to Boon Chwee, Chin Hwee collected a profit of $11,300/- on the Accused’s behalf.

### The Home Eatery Charges

12     The co-accused was Lim Bee Eng (“Bee Eng”). He was the registered director of Home Eatery Pte Ltd (“Home Eatery”). Home Eatery operated a coffee-shop business at Bishan Street 11.

### Background Facts

13     The Accused and Bee Eng became acquainted sometime in August 2015. He shared with Bee Eng that there was a demand for foreign workers by food stall operators, with the highest demand being amongst the Indian operators. These operators were willing to pay up to $2,000/- for each foreign worker, in addition to paying their salaries.

14     Seizing the opportunity, the Accused and Bee Eng entered into a scheme of using Home Eatery’s foreign worker quota to supply foreign workers to these food stall operators for a fee of $1,000/- to $1,300/- for each foreigner. The food stall operators would be the actual employers. These foreigners would not have any form of employment relationship with Home Eatery.

15     All interested food stall operators would have to agree with the following conditions –

(i)     Sign a management agreement with Home Eatery;

(ii)     Obtain the National Environment Agency (“NEA”) food shop licence under the name of Home Eatery, and which would be displayed at the food stall; and

(iii)     Pay a monthly sum of $1,000/- to the Accused for each foreign worker.

16     The management agreement and the NEA licence were required to give the false impression that the food stall was under the management of Home Eatery in case of a surprise inspection by the authorities.

17     The Accused recruited the help of one Arakkasu Alameen (“Alameen”) to source for workers from India. Once a suitable worker was identified, either the Accused or Alameen would use Bee Eng’s Singpass account to apply for the work pass online. Bee Eng would sign the application forms and falsely declared that the foreigner would be employed by Home Eatery.

### Facts relating to MAC 900888-89/17 & MAC 900892-4/17

18     Govindarajan Kumar (“Kumar”) was a food stall operator. He elicited the Accused’s help to supply five foreign workers for his food stalls. The Accused obtained work passes under Home Eatery for the five foreign workers. They were not employed by Home Eatery. Instead, they worked at Kumar’s food stalls. Kumar’s food stall business was independent of Home Eatery’s business.

### Facts relating to MAC 900903-04/17 & MAC 900906/17

19     Mariappa Selvaganapathy s/o Balasubramaniam (“Mariappa”) operated a number of food stalls. Sometime in April 2016, he approached the Accused for help to employ foreign workers to work at his food stall. The Accused and Bee Eng obtained three foreign workers issued with work passes under Home Eatery for him. The three foreign workers did not work for Home Eatery. At all times, they worked at Mariappa’s food stall. For the duration of their employment, Mariappa made monthly payments of $1,000/- in respect of each worker to the Accused.

### Facts relating to MAC 900908/17

20     On 4 Jul 16, Manoharan Somu (“Manoharan”), registered a company with the intention of setting up a food stall. Sometime in July 2016, he was introduced to the Accused by a friend. The Accused and Bee Eng helped him to obtain a foreign worker issued with a work pass under Home Eatery. However, the foreign worker did not work for Home Eatery. Instead he was employed by Manoharan to work at his food stall. Throughout the duration of his employment at the food stall, Manoharan made monthly payments of $1,000/- to the Accused.

### The Royal Success Charges

### Background Facts

21     Subsequently, MOM conducted investigation on the Accused and Bee Eng for the offences in relation to Home Eatery. Whilst under investigation, they continued the labour supply scheme using a different company, Royal Success. The registered director of Royal Success was Lim Peng Siong (“Peng Siong”), who was Bee Eng’s son. However, the company was wholly operated and managed by Bee Eng and the Accused.

### Facts relating to MAC 909389-90/18

22     Sometime in August 2016, one Swaminathan Selvakumar (“Selvakumar”), a food stall operator, approached the Accused for help to get him foreign workers. In consideration, Selvakumar would pay him $1,500/- for each foreign worker supplied. A portion of the $1,500/- would be used to pay for the levies.

23     Sometime in April 2017, after securing two foreigners who were willing to work for Selvakumar, the Accused used Peng Siong’s Singpass account to apply for their work passes online. Bee Eng filled in his particulars as employer and signed the hard copy of the forms. He also falsely declared that the two foreigners would be employed by Royal Success. The two work passes under Royal Success were issued on 19 and 26 Apr 16. The two foreign workers did not work for Royal Success after they were issued with the work passes. At all times, they worked at Selvakumar’s food stall.

24     Selvakumar paid the Accused $1,500/- monthly for the 10 months the two foreign workers worked at his stall. The total benefit obtained by the Accused for the 10 months, less the monthly levy payments, was $17,000/-.

### Facts relating to MAC 909398/18

25     As a consequence of the above, in relation to one of the two foreign workers named Peramaian, the Accused had intentionally aided Selvakumar to employ him at Selvakumar’s food stall without a valid work pass from 19 Apr 17 to 8 Feb 18. Throughout the said period, Selvakumar had exercised full control over his employment. Peramaian received work instructions from him. He worked at the food stall from Mondays to Sundays, from 7.00 am to 3.00 pm, with two off days per month. Selvakumar also paid him a monthly salary of $1,800/-.

## ACCUSED’S CRIMINAL RECORDS

26     He has convictions on 7 Oct 10 as follows -

(i)     Fined $6,000/- for the offence of employment a foreign worker without a valid work pass vide s 5(1) read with s 5(6) of the EFMA.

(ii)     Sentenced to eight weeks’ imprisonment on two counts, and two weeks’ imprisonment on seven counts, for the offence of abetting the making of a false statement to the Controller or Employment Inspector vide s 22(1)(d) read with s 23(1) punishable under s 22(1)(ii) of the EFMA. The global imprisonment sentence was 10 weeks.

(iii)     Two counts under s 5(1) read with s 5(6) of the EFMA, and one count under s 22(1)(d) read with s 23(1) punishable under s 22(1)(ii) of the EFMA, were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

## PROSECUTION’S SUBMISSION ON SENTENCE

27     Mr Rias asked for the following sentences –

(i)     Seven months’ imprisonment per charge for the four Hong Kong Street charges;

(ii)     Eight months’ imprisonment per charge for the nine Home Eatery and two Royal Success charges;

(iii)     Two months’ imprisonment and fine $13,000/- for the one Royal Success charge under s 5(1) read with s 23(1) of the EFMA;

(iv)     A fine of $2,000/- in lieu of the caning provided for under s 22B(3) read with s 22B(2) of the EFMA, as the Accused could not be caned by virtue of his age.

28     Mr Rias asked for four of the imprisonment sentences to run consecutively, making the global sentence 30 months’ imprisonment and $15,000 fine. He also sought an order directing the Accused to pay the sum of $54,490/- under s 23A(1)(b) EFMA. This sum equals the amount which the Accused had received for obtaining the work passes in relation to the 15 proceeded charges under s 22B(1) EFMA.

### The Offence-Specific Factors

29     Mr Rias identified deterrence as the dominant sentencing principle. He pointed out the offence-specific factors that were aggravating -

### (i)    The Accused was the master mind

30     He engineered the scheme in 2014, set the contours of the scheme and assigned specific roles to his co-accused persons. He also recruited Alameen to source for workers in India. He was the pivot as all the food stall operators had dealt him directly for his help.

### (ii)    Scale of operation was extensive

31     The scheme involved seven employers and 32 foreign workers. The Accused’s scheme became so established that he did not need to source for business; the operators came looking for him. His operation extended beyond applying for work passes. He also sourced for foreigners, and arranged for them to be brought to their actual employer’s place of business.

32     Mandatory caning was prescribed under s 22B EFMA when an offender has been charged with more than five such offences, and has been convicted on at least six offences at the same trial. This was indicative that the bigger the scale of operations, the more serious the offence. In this case, the total number of foreign workers brought in was more than five times the minimum set by Parliament for the mandatory caning provision. Also the adverse impact of the offences and the social ills caused by it would have been magnified by the large number of foreign workers brought in.

### (iii)    The offences were motivated by greed

33     The Accused was motivated by the easy profit gained. He benefited to the tune of $54,490/-. The fact that he was not able to start a company on his own did not pose any difficulty for him. He persuaded and enticed others to start companies for him to use for the scheme.

### (iv)    The Accused took concerted steps to conceal the offences

34     These offences were difficult to detect even without efforts to hide them. In relation to the Home Eatery charges, the Accused took additional steps to conceal the offences by giving the false impression that Home Eatery was running the food stalls through the use of management agreements and displaying NEA licences at the stalls. The Accused’s scheme unravelled only because the food stall operators confessed to MOM.

### (v)    The integrity of the work pass framework was tampered with

35     The sheer number of work passes issued under the scheme in itself had caused the integrity of the work pass framework to suffer. MOM’s policy of restricting foreigners from being employed at food stalls was also frustrated. In fact, the primary objective of the Accused’ scheme was to circumvent this policy in order to enrich himself.

### (vi)    Appreciable harm was done

36     Unskilled foreign workers were a class of vulnerable persons needing protection of the law. They were entirely dependent on their employers for both financial security and welfare. Admittedly, the 32 foreign workers in this case were not left to fend off on their own. But their actual employers were not bound by the conditions that attached to their work passes. These conditions included the fundamental right to be paid in a timely manner, and to be housed in an acceptable accommodation.

37     The foreign workers in relation to the Home Eatery and Royal Success charges were issued with Employment Passes and S-Passes with higher declared salaries. Some of them would have accepted the employment on the basis of these higher declared salaries. But they were not paid accordingly when they arrived here.

38     Quite apart from the harm caused to the foreign workers, the fact that the foreign workers had come and worked here meant that the local population had been deprived of employment opportunity.

### The Offender-Specific Factors

### (i)    17 similar charges taken into consideration

39     17 similar charges were taken into consideration. Mr Rias submitted that its effect was to warrant an enhancement of the sentence: _PP v UI_ \[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 500 at \[38\].

### (ii)    Relevant antecedents demonstrates recalcitrance

40     The Accused’s previous convictions were for the same or similar offences. Yet the prison sentences which he had served had very little deterrent effect on him. Specific deterrence required that the sentences imposed in the present case should be sufficiently high to deter him from re-offending.

### (iii)    Accused’s persistent offending behaviour

41     The Accused’s persistence showed when he roped in his wife to take his place while he served his imprisonment sentence in relation to his income tax offences. He made sure that his criminal enterprise continued in his absence. More egregiously, he continued with his criminal enterprise even when he was under investigation for the offences in relation to the HKS charges. His unrelenting nature to commit these offences demonstrated his blatant disregard for the law.

### Case Precedents

42     Mr Rias cited 11 cases to show that his proposed sentences in relation to the s 22B(1) EFMA charges fell within the range of sentences imposed in these precedent cases. He then focused on three cases which were closest to the present case. These were –

(i)      _PP v Lim Kien Peng \[MAC 1864/14 & Ors\](“Lim Kien Peng”)_: The offender was a director of a company. He obtained work passes for 30 foreigners for a shell company. It released them to seek their own employment. The offender received illicit gains of at least $30,000/-. He was convicted on five charges and 25 charges were TIC. He was sentenced to nine months’ imprisonment per charge, with three ordered to run consecutively. The total sentence was 27 months’ imprisonment.

(ii)      _PP v Toh Gim Por \[MAC 908018/15 & Ors\](“Toh Gim Por”)_: The offender submitted work pass applications for 37 foreigners under an inoperative company. He signed the forms in the name of a “sleeping” director. The workers were left to their own devises. He obtained illicit gains of $10,000/-. He was convicted on five charges and 41 charges were TIC. He was sentenced to 10 months’ imprisonment and $3,000/- fine per charge, with four ordered to run consecutively. The total sentence was 40 months’ imprisonment and fine $15,000/-.

(iii)      _PP v Mui Chee Mun \[MAC 903992/16 & Ors\](“Mui Chee Mun”)_: The offender submitted work pass applications for 37 foreign workers. He signed the forms in the name of a “sleeping director”. The workers were released to look for their own employment. The offender obtained illicit gains of $46,250/-. He was convicted on 13 charges with 24 charges TIC. He was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment per charge, with three to run consecutively. The total sentence was 36 months’ imprisonment. He was also fined $2,000/- in lieu of caning.

## ACCUSED’S MITIGATION

43     Mr Kertar Singh narrated the circumstances that led to the offences. After the Accused became a bankrupt, he helped out at a friend’s coffee-shop. That was when he learned about how food stall holders were facing manpower shortage because they were unable to hire foreign workers. He also learned that there was a market practice where food stall holders entered into joint ventures or partnerships with coffee-shop owners or F&B companies to enable them to employ foreign workers. The coffee-shop owners or the F&B companies would apply for the NEA licence. He decided to adopt this practice to employ foreign workers and deploy them at food stalls to help the food stall overcome their manpower problem and provide him with a source of income.

44     HKS was an existing company when it was taken over by Boon Chwee. Boon Chwee and the Accused used HKS to do home deliveries. They engaged local workers to do so. Sometime in mid-2014, the Accused was introduced to Catherine who was facing manpower shortage. During the meeting, it was agreed that HKS would help her. It was against this backdrop that the offences were committed.

45     When the Accused was under investigation by MOM for the HKS charges, he was asked whether he had any formal agreement with Catherine. This gave him the erroneous impression that the scheme would be legal if there was a formal agreement in place.

46     Sometime in August 2015, he joined Bee Eng in Home Eatery. He then suggested to Bee Eng that they operate a coffee-shop under Home Eatery. The coffee-shop business was going smoothly when the Accused suggested that it focused on individual food stalls nation-wide, provide home deliveries and help ease the manpower problems of the food stalls. Home Eatery chose not to enter into an agreement with the coffee-shop owners because of unfavourable terms. Instead a management agreement was drawn out between the food stalls owners and Home Eatery.

47     Home Eatery then provided these food stalls with foreign workers for a monthly payment of $1,200/- for each worker. After deducting the levies, the balance represented the profits for Home Eatery.

48     Mr Singh highlighted the Accused genuine remorse as evidenced by his plea of guilty. The scheme was by mutual agreement between the parties and benefitted all the parties involved. It created job opportunities and eased the food stall holders’ acute manpower shortage. This made it easier for coffee-shop owners to rent out their stalls. He was under the erroneous impression that by properly applying for work permits and signing the management agreement, the scheme satisfied all legal requirements. The Accused had merely blindly followed the existing market practice. He was ignorant of the law.

49     He had not exploited the foreign workers unlike in most of the precedent cases cited. These workers came here with jobs. He did not extract kickbacks from them. Instead the benefits that he obtained were from the food stall holders who paid him for his services. The three companies were not shell companies. In particular, Home Eatery and Royal Success were already in the F&B industry before the Accused joined them. They were not created for the sole purpose of acting as a front for the supply of foreign workers. All their dealings were above board and there was no attempt at concealment.

50     Lastly, the Accused was the main pillar of support for his family. His two younger sons were still studying. His wife was a housewife. Currently he worked as an administrative and operations executive in a F&B company with a salary of $2000/- a month. A long term imprisonment sentence would inflict considerable hardship on his family.

51     Mr Singh had no quarrel with the Prosecution’s sentencing proposal of seven months’ imprisonment in relation to the HKS charges. However, based on his submission which were summarised at \[49\] and \[50\], he argued that the same sentence should be meted out for all the other charges as well. He also submitted that only three sentences should run consecutively.

## THE SENTENCE

### Aggravating/Mitigating Factors

52     I did not agree with Mr Singh’s characterisation that there was no attempt at concealment by the Accused. In relation to the Home Eatery and Royal Success charges, he took active steps to disguise the illegal nature of the employment by way of the management agreement and the NEA licence. They helped to create the false impression that Home Eatery and Royal Success were operating the food stalls. He did this because he was fully aware that what he was doing was illegal.

53     On harm, I disagreed with Mr Singh’s submission that no harm was done. As pointed out by Mr Rias, these foreign workers were left exposed and deprived of the protection ordinarily afforded to them by the conditions under their work passes. This was because they were not employed by the companies stated in their work passes. A number of the foreign workers had been issued with EP and S-passes, with higher salaries. However, they were not paid these salaries. More importantly, the Accused’s scheme had compromised the integrity and effectiveness of the work pass policies. Therefore, there was harm caused although it was lower than in the case precedents cited where shell companies were involved, kickbacks received from the foreign workers, and leaving them to fend for themselves here.

54     To the two preceding paragraphs, I would add the offence specific factors and offender specific factors which had been comprehensively enumerated by Mr Rias. These were relevant aggravating factors. Further, given his previous similar antecedents, there was also the factor of specific deterrence that should be reflected in the sentence imposed.

55     Mr Singh’s submission that the Accused had helped to generate employment and also helped the food stall operators with their manpower problem and thereby improving their businesses were not mitigating circumstances. The Accused should not be given credit for favourable outcomes that arose from his blatant breaking of the law. At best these factors were neutral. In any event, I very much doubt that the scheme was hatched out of a noble intention to help the troubled food stall operators. He was lured by the easy way of obtaining a lucrative profit. That was why he had got his wife involved to cover for him while he was serving imprisonment. That also explained his persistence in continuing with the scheme even when he was under investigation. As for his plea of guilty, I would also not give it its full weight as he had done so only in the midst of the trial.

### Sentences for the s 22B(1) EFMA offences

56     The s 22B(1) EFMA offence prescribed a sentence of an imprisonment for a term of not less than six months and not more than two years, and shall also be liable to a fine not exceeding $30,000/-. The 11 precedent cases cited by Mr Rias showed a range of seven to 12 months’ imprisonment. The three closest in its facts to the present case were _Lim Kien Peng, Tor Gim Por and Mui Chee Mun_ – (see \[42\]). The sentences in these three cases ranged from nine to 12 months’ imprisonment. These cases were more egregious as they involved the creation of shell companies, abandonment of the workers and receipt of kickbacks from the workers. As such, I would have to moderate the sentences downwards for the present case as these aggravating factors were not present.

57     All considered, I imposed the following sentences –

(i)     Seven months’ imprisonment on each of the four HKS charges;

(ii)     Eight months’ imprisonment for each of the seven Home Eatery charges; and

(iii)     Eight months’ imprisonment for each of the two Royal Success charges.

### Caning under s 22B(2) EFMA

58     Caning was mandatory under s 22B(2) EFMA as the Accused had been charged with more than five offences, and convicted on at least six offences at the same trial. As he could not be caned because of his age, I have to impose a fine not exceeding $10,000/- in lieu of caning. I imposed a fine of $2,000/- in default to serve one week’s imprisonment.

59     In this, there was the issue whether caning should be imposed on each individual charge proceeded with (“individual offence approach”) or cumulatively on all the proceeded charges (“cumulative offences approach”). I accepted the submissions by Mr Rias that the cumulative offences approach should be adopted for s 22B(2) EFMA. The issue was canvassed in _Shanmugam P v PP_ \[2000\] 1 SLR(R) 662 (_“Shanmugam P”_). _Shanmugam P_ dealt with s 57(1A) Immigration Act, Cap 133 (“IA”) which prescribed mandatory caning where the defendant had hired more than five immigration offenders. Yong Pung How CJ preferred the individual offence approach for the following reasons –

(i)     It accorded with the plain and ordinary reading of the provision;

(ii)     It accorded with Parliament’s intention in providing for strict penalties in dealing with immigration law offenders; and

(iii)     There is a general principle that the sentence for an offence should be specific and a separate sentence should be passed on each charge. There was nothing to indicate that this general principle ought to be departed from in this case.

60     If the individual offence approach was adopted for s 22B(2) EFMA, then it practically meant that the offender would face a minimum mandatory of six strokes of the cane because of the second condition precedent that the offender must have been convicted on at least six charges at the same trial. I did not think that Parliament intended for this outcome. This condition precedent was not present in s 57(1A) IA. The IA provision could be invoked even if only one such charge was preferred or proceeded with, so long as it was proved to the satisfaction of the court that more than five immigration offenders were employed at the same time by the offender. There was therefore a good reason to depart from the general principle in \[59(iii)\] above. The wordings in s 22B(2) EFMA did not preclude the application of the cumulative offences approach.

### Sentence for the s 5(1) EFMA offence

61     In relation to the s 5(1) EFMA offence, the Accused was liable to a fine of not less than $10,000/- and with imprisonment for a term of not less than one month and not more than 12 months. Given his similar previous conviction, and taking into account the offence-specific and offender-specific factors present, I agreed with Mr Rias that an uplift was warranted. As such, I sentenced him to two months’ imprisonment and fined $13,000/- or one month’s imprisonment in default of payment.

### Penalty under s 23A EFMA

62     I also made an order that the Accused pay a penalty under s 23A EFMA of $54,490/- in default to serve four months’ imprisonment. This amount represented the profits that the Accused had received from the 15 proceeded charges under s 22B(1) EFMA.

### Consecutive/Concurrent Order

63     On consecutive sentences, I ordered that the imprisonment sentences in one HKS charge (MAC 909179/16), one Home Eatery charge (MAC 900888/17), one Royal Success charge (MAC 909389/18), and the s 5(1) EFMA charge (MAC 909398/18) run consecutively.

64     The total aggregate sentence that I imposed on the Accused was 25 months’ imprisonment, and fine of $15,000/- in default one month’s and one week’s imprisonment, and penalty of $54,490/- in default four months’ imprisonment.

65     The Accused has lodged an appeal against the sentence. He is presently on bail pending the outcome of his appeal.
