Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9276/2021/01.\]

19 December 2021

### District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt:

## Introduction

1       The accused, a 48-year old female Singaporean, pleaded guilty to nine charges relating to money-laundering offences under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act, Chapter 65A (“CDSA”). She further admitted and consented to have an additional 41 charges for similar offences under the CDSA to be taken into consideration (“TIC”) for the purpose of her sentence. She was represented by counsel when she pleaded guilty to the charges.

2       She was sentenced to a total of 30 months' imprisonment. Her counsel filed an appeal against the sentence which the accused is presently serving. There was no application for the accused to be released on bail pending the appeal.

## Charges

3       The nine charges to which the accused pleaded guilty (“proceeded charges”) comprise of:

> a)     Seven charges for offences of acquiring benefits from criminal conduct under s 47(3) of the CDSA “s 47(3) offence/charge”; and

> b)     Two charges for offences of failing to report about cross border movements of cash exceeding the prescribed amount of S$20,000 under s 48C(1) of the CDSA (“s 48C(1) offence/charge”).

4       She admitted to 38 additional s 47(3) charges and three additional s 48C(1) charges and consented for these 41 charges to be TIC.

5       As the charges are similarly framed, I reproduce only one s 47(3) charge and one s 48C(1) charge for easy reference as follows:

> DAC-924326-2019 (1st Charge)

> You…are charged that you, on or about 13 January 2017, in Singapore, did acquire property, to wit, a sum of US$315,000 (S$445,514.78) in your HSBC bank account no. XXX, when you had reasonable grounds to believe that such property, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, represents another person’s benefits from criminal conduct, namely, a foreign serious offence under Section 5(1) of the Cybercrime and Computer Related Crimes Act in the Republic of Botswana which conduct if occurred in Singapore would have constituted a serious offence under Section 3 of the Computer Misuse Act (Cap.50A) , and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 47(3) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Chapter 65A) (“CDSA”) punishable under Section 47(6)(a) of the CDSA.

> DAC-924374-2019 (49 th Charge)

> You… are charged that you, on 5 October 2016 at about 8.30 pm, at Woodlands Checkpoint Bus Hall, Singapore, did move out of Singapore a sum of S$105,500 in cash, the total value of which exceeds the prescribed amount of S$20,000, without giving a report in respect of the said movement in accordance with Section 48C of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act, Chapter 65A (“the Act”), and you have thereby contravened Section 48C(1) of the Act and committed an offence punishable under Section 48C(2) of the Act.

6       The above two charges represent the most serious (i.e. involving the largest sums of money) of the two sets of charges for the s 47(3) offences and the s 48C(1) offences respectively.

## Sentence Imposed

7       The accused was sentenced as follows in respect of the nine proceeded charges:

8       The imprisonment sentence was deferred to 1 December 2021 as requested by counsel. The accused surrendered on 1 December 2021 and commenced her sentence. Counsel then filed the appeal on 6 December 2021.

## Statement of Facts

9       The accused admitted to the following statement of facts (“SOF”) without qualification[^1]:

> A      INTRODUCTION & BACKGROUND FACTS

> 1.    The accused is Annee Foong, a 48-year-old female Singapore Citizen (NRIC XXX). At the material time, she was working as a secretary at a law firm in Singapore.

> 2.    The involved parties are:

>> (a)    A male person known as Steve Williams (“Steve”) who is purportedly a British citizen working as an Engineer. The accused met Steve through Badoo, a social networking/meeting online site.

>> (b)    A female person known as Tina Razak (“Tina”), purportedly a Malaysian national, who was a secretary of Steve.

> 3.    The accused got to know Steve sometime in mid-July 2016 through Badoo. They chatted very briefly and exchanged contact numbers. Steve provided a U.K. mobile number to the accused for this purpose. Thereafter they communicated more regularly through WhatsApp messages and audio calls.

> 4.    During these conversations, Steve asked the accused to provide him with her bank account numbers which could allow for withdrawals of at least $30,000 in Johor. About one or two days after this, Steve notified the accused that he had transferred money to her bank accounts and told her to remit it to his secretary via Moneygram. He also instructed her to use the remaining monies to open several bank accounts for him and deposit the monies in various bank accounts. Steve also asked her to make multiple transfers to other bank accounts which were held by persons unknown to the accused. The accused also allowed Steve access to her passwords for the newly opened bank accounts.

> 5.    Between 8 September 2016 and 18 November 2016, the accused was investigated by various investigation officers from the Singapore Police Force in connection with the transactions and banking activities which she did on Steve’s instructions. She was informed by the police about the suspicious nature of these transactions and verbally cautioned by the police officers on five occasions[^2] not to open more bank accounts for Steve and carry out transactions which he instructed her to. She was specifically informed by the police officers that she was being investigated because her bank accounts had been used to receive monies from persons who had been cheated.

> 6.    Following this, sometime in December 2016, the accused changed her passwords for six of her internet banking accounts, to prevent Steve from accessing her accounts to conduct money transfers. The accused did this as she was suspicious of Steve’s intentions and she had a reason to believe, from the police investigations in the preceding months, that the bank accounts were used to receive monies which represented proceeds of crimes committed against other persons. In addition, the accused also grew suspicious as Steve was failing to give her completely satisfactory answers to her questions about why she was called up for police investigations surrounding the transfers which she had done on his instructions before 8 September 2016.

> B      FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 1st CHARGE UNDER SECTION 47(3) PENAL CODE

> 7.    On 18 January 2017, CAD received a complaint from the CEO of Capital Bank Limited, a commercial bank in the Republic of Botswana (“Botswana”), stating that his bank’s system was hacked by unknown persons, and a fraudulent transfer of US$315,000 ($445,514.78) was made from their Citibank New York bank account to the accused’s HSBC bank account XXX (“HSBC account”). The unknown persons had detected the passwords and login IDs remotely and accessed the bank’s information technology system with the aid of malware. As a result, an electronic transfer of US$315,000 ($445,514.78) was executed and transferred to the HSBC account.

> 8.    The HSBC account was opened by the accused on 11 October 2016, after she had been cautioned by the police that her accounts were used to remit and receive proceeds from cheating crimes. The account was opened by the accused for the specific purpose of allowing Steve to transfer monies into the account, and for her to transfer or withdraw the monies for onward remittance to accounts given by Steve. At the time the accused opened the HSBC account, she had reasonable grounds to believe that Steve was instructing her to receive and remit monies which represented either his or another person’s benefits of cheating offences and/or other criminal conduct.

> 9.    These monies represented the benefits of an offence under Section 5(1) of the Cybercrime and Computer Related Crimes Act (Chapter 08:06) in the Republic of Botswana, which concerns unauthorised access to a computer service. Pursuant to this provision, an offence is disclosed where a person knowingly and by any means without authorisation secures access to any computer system for the purpose of obtaining directly or indirectly any computer service.

> 10.    This conduct under Section 5(1) of the Cybercrime and Computer Related Crimes Act (Chapter 08:06) in the Republic of Botswana if occurred in Singapore, would constitute an offence under Section 3 of the Computer Misuse Act (Cap 50A) (“CMA”). Section 3 of the CMA is a serious offence in the CDSA. Therefore, the US$315,000 ($445,514.78) represents the benefits of a foreign serious offence, which constitutes criminal conduct under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap. 65A) (“CDSA”).

> 11.    On or about 13 January 2017, Steve informed the accused that an amount of about $400,000 would be transferred to her HSBC account as this was his retirement fund and he wanted her to receive these monies and withdraw it so that it can be passed to another person who would collect the money for Steve. The accused agreed to assist Steve with this arrangement. After US$315,000 ($445,514.78) was received into the HSBC account on 13 January 2019, Steve informed the accused to carry out the arrangement by withdrawing the monies for the purpose of passing the monies to another. The accused managed to transfer about $11,708.94 out of the HSBC account but was unable to withdraw the remaining $433,805.84 which Steve had informed her was deposited into her HSBC account, as the bank staff identified this to be a suspicious transaction and did not allow the withdrawal.

> 12.    On or about 13 January 2017, in Singapore, the accused having reasonable grounds to believe that this property, _to wit_, a sum of S$445,514.78 in HSBC bank account no. XXX, represents another person’s benefits of criminal conduct, had acquired such property by receiving the said monies in her HSBC account, and has thereby committed an offence under Section 47(3) of the CDSA punishable under Section 47(6) of the CDSA.

> C      FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 10th, 11th, 23rd, 31st, 34th, 45th CHARGES UNDER SECTION 47(3) CDSA

> 13.    On the following six (6) occasions ,the accused did acquire property (as reflected in the table), namely cash, when she had reasonable grounds to believe that such property, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, represents another person’s benefits from criminal conduct, namely, cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property under Section 420 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Revised Edition):

> 14.    The accused already had reasonable grounds to believe at the time of each of these six occasions, that she had been transacting with monies, on the instruction of Steve, that were linked to proceeds from cheating offences. On all of these six occasions, she was acting on the instructions of Steve to receive and transfer these monies to other bank accounts. The accused thereafter transferred the monies received on these six occasions to persons as instructed by Steve.

> 15.    The accused has thereby committed offences under Section 47(3) of the CDSA punishable under Section 47(6) of the CDSA. Apart from the DBS/POSB bank account, all the other bank accounts were opened only in 2016 for the specific purpose of facilitating the transactions on the instructions of Steve. The DBS/POSB account was also opened by the accused by using her daughter’s name (who was 19 years old at the material time). The accused had control and access to the monies in this account at all material times.

> 16.    The accused, on 4 October 2016 at about 8.31 p.m., at Woodlands Checkpoint Bus Hall, Singapore, did move out of Singapore a sum of S$76,500 in cash, the total value of which exceeds the prescribed amount of S$20,000, without giving a report in respect of the said movement in accordance with Section 48C of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act, Chapter 65A (“CDSA”), and has thereby contravened Section 48C(1) of the CDSA and committed an offence punishable under Section 48C(2) of the CDSA.

> 17.    The accused, on 5 October 2016, at Woodlands Checkpoint Bus Hall, Singapore, did move out of Singapore a sum of S$105,500 in cash, the total value of which exceeds the prescribed amount of S$20,000, without giving a report in respect of the said movement in accordance with Section 48C of the CDSA, and has thereby contravened Section 48C(1) of the CDSA and committed an offence punishable under Section 48C(2) of the CDSA.

> 18.    On both these occasions, the accused brought these sums of monies to pass to Tina at a café in Johor Bahru, on the instructions of Steve. These monies represented proceeds from cheating offences committed against other persons.

> E      CONCLUSION

> 19.    The accused received about $3,800 from Steve.

> 20.    During investigations, CAD seized $433,805.84 (originally from First Capital Bank Limited) in the HSBC account of the accused.

11     The punishment for a s 47(3) offence is prescribed in s 48(C)(2) of the CDSA to be a fine not exceeding S$500,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or both.

12     The punishment for a s 48C(1) offence is prescribed in s 48(C)(2) of the CDSA to be a fine not exceeding $50,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or both.

13     It was common ground between the parties that the accused should be imprisoned for all the proceeded charges. There was no question of any fines being imposed for any of the charges. The only question separating the parties was how long the individual and aggregate imprisonment terms ought to be.

### Prosecution’s Sentencing Position

14     I considered the sentencing position of the Prosecution. In his summary written submission on sentence, the learned DPP asked for the following sentences to be imposed on the accused:

15     As regards the global imprisonment sentence, the Prosecution asked for three sentences of imprisonment to run consecutively i.e. in respect of the 1st charge, one other s 47(3) charge, and a s 48C(1) charge making a total term of at least 36 months’ imprisonment.

16     The Prosecution submitted in the alternative that if the court was to take the view that the individual sentences for the s 47(3) charges ought to be lower, then it is proposed that the sentences for _more than three charges_ should be ordered to run consecutively such that the global sentence would be at least 36 months’ imprisonment.

17     As explained below, the sentence that I eventually imposed on the accused was a hybrid of the two options in that the sentences for the individual s 47(3) charges were reduced but I ordered the sentences of three of these charges to run consecutively but did not order the sentence of any of the s 48C(1) charges to run consecutively.

### Defence’s Sentencing Position

18     On the other hand, Counsel submitted for lower individual and aggregate sentences. I set out Counsel’s proposed sentences alongside those of the Prosecution's as follows for comparison[^9]:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="33.3382921749479%"> <col width="33.3234156501041%"> <col width="33.3382921749479%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Defence’s Position</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Prosecution’s Position</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">1<sup>st</sup> charge</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">under s 47(3) CDSA</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">[involving S$445,514.78]</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">No more than 18 months’</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">At least 24 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Remaining proceeded s 47(3) CDSA charges</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">[ranging from S$34,500 to S$58,000]</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">No more than 5 months’</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">At least 8 months’ imprisonment per charge</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Proceeded two charges under s 48C(1) CDSA</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">[involving S$76,500 and S$105,500]</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">No more than 3 months’ imprisonment per charge</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">At least 4 months’</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Global sentence</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">No more than 26 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">At least 36 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

19     Counsel also submitted for the same combination of three consecutive sentences as per Prosecution’s first option i.e. the 1st charge, one other s 47(3) charge, and a s 48C(1) charge making a total term of not more than 26 months’ imprisonment.

### Relevant Sentencing Principles

20     First and foremost, I am of the view that general deterrence is the predominant sentencing consideration for money laundering offences. This is so because a proliferation of such offences would have a detrimental effect on Singapore’s reputation as an international financial centre. Such offences are pernicious and grave in nature because they facilitate proceeds from criminal activities to be channelled quickly to the hands (or the bank accounts) of the perpetrators of the predicate crimes, through multiple layers of money launderers as intermediaries.

21     Money laundering offences may, on the surface and taken in isolation, appear to be simplistic and even harmless. Make no mistake about it, however, because these seemingly innocuous transfers are integral to sophisticated international criminal schemes and enterprises. The offences serve to obfuscate and cover up the money trails in order for the perpetrators of the predicate offences to ultimately enjoy the fruits of their crimes and not be traced back to the predicate offences. The investigations against the perpetrators of the predicate crimes are also made more difficult by the layers of intermediaries in the form of money mules employed to cover the tracks of the main perpetrators.

22     The need for deterrence against money laundering offences was thus highlighted in _PP v Ang Jeanette_ \[2011\] 4 SLR at \[73\] (“_Ang Jeanette_”):

> Further, against the backdrop of Singapore’s significant private banking and asset management sector and its standing as a major international financial centre in the Asia-Pacific region, there is a compelling need to deter would be “money launderers who want to clean their ill-gotten gains”… **A clear signal must be sent to those who might wish to conduct money laundering activities here that if they are apprehended, they will be firmly dealt with.**

\[Emphasis added\]

There is no doubt that sufficient deterrent sentences must be imposed to deter money launderers and effectively disrupt the money laundering networks.

### Individual Sentences

23     Except for the sentence in respect of the first charge for the most serious s 47(3) offence (“first charge”), the sentences imposed in respect of all the remaining proceeded charges were exactly what Counsel had asked for i.e. five months’ imprisonment for the remaining s 47(3) charges and three months’ imprisonment for the two s 48C(1) charges. Therefore, the accused would and should have no issues with the individual sentences imposed in respect of these charges.

24     Even for the first charge, the imposed sentence of 20 months’ imprisonment is only two months longer that what Counsel had submitted. The sentence imposed for this charge is in fact four months less than that asked for by the Prosecution. I also agree that the sentence sought by the Prosecution for this charge is consistent with the sentences imposed in the precedents cited by the Prosecution in _Public Prosecutor v Yap Chen Hsian Osborn_ and _Public Prosecutor v Mohamed Salim_, and commensurate with the very large amount of money laundered in respect of the first charge i.e. S$445,514.78.

25     I further considered that there are no less than 38 other TIC s 47(3) charges. These TIC charges are for offences similar to the first charge and poignantly reflect the accused’s enhanced culpability and propensity to commit such offences. The TIC charges should accordingly be given due weight and enhance the sentence that would otherwise be awarded: _Public Prosecutor v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 439</span> at \[19\]. The increase in sentence is “commonsensical as the offender, by agreeing to have the TIC offences in question taken into consideration for sentencing purposes, has in substance admitted that he committed those offences”: _Public Prosecutor v UI_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR 500</span>.

26     Notwithstanding that the sentence sought by the Prosecution in respect of the first charge is more than justified, I calibrated the sentence downwards from what was submitted by the Prosecution. I considered and gave due weight to the fact that $433,805.84 was recovered in respect of this charge. The recovery of this amount considerably reduced the harm factor in respect of the first charge. However, in terms of culpability, the accused cannot be given any credit for this recovery because she in fact tried to withdraw this amount of money as instructed by Steve, but her attempt was thwarted by the vigilance of the bank officers. Therefore, the recovery of the money does not reduce the culpability factor of the offence at all.

### Culpability of Accused

27     I rejected some of the points raised as mitigating factors in Counsel’s mitigation plea. I did not agree that the accused’s offences were “_completely out of character_” and “_primarily borne out of a disastrous lapse and error of judgment and an irrational and misjudged response to the personal circumstances and issues she was presented with at the time_”,[^10] or that her judgment was “_clouded by her romantic feelings_”.[^11]

28     For a start, I reiterated some salient facts in the SOF that would completely refute the submission that the accused was nothing more than a victim of circumstances and had committed the offences primarily due to a lapse of judgment. I pointed out to Counsel that the accused was in a better position than most money-mules to be able to pick out the red flags and recognise the suspicious nature of the transactions that she was being asked to perform. After all, she was working as a legal secretary in a law firm and she could have sought the counsel of the lawyers and colleagues in her firm but she chose not to.

29     In fact, she did not even have to identify the red flags for herself because these were revealed to her by the police no less. This made her culpability even more significant. As revealed in the SOF, she first started to assist Steve, whom she met only on social media, to use her bank accounts to receive and transfer funds from about July 2016. She was then investigated between September 2016 and November 2016 by multiple investigation officers from the Singapore Police Force in connection with her suspicious banking activities. She was warned by the police on no less than five occasions not to open more bank accounts or carry out banking transactions for Steve. She was specifically told by the police that she was being investigated because her bank accounts had been used to receive monies from persons who had been cheated. In other words, she was told in no uncertain terms that she was in fact helping Steve to launder criminal proceeds. Despite the investigations against her and the warnings regarding Steve, the accused committed the offence in the first charge in 13 Jan 2017 by agreeing to and receiving US$315,000 ($445,514.78) into her HSBC account as arranged by Steve. She also managed to withdraw about $11,000 out of her account as instructed by Steve and would have withdrawn or transferred the remaining money if the bank officers had not stopped the transfers because the transactions were deemed suspicious.

30     The accused cannot also claim to have been manipulated or smitten by the charms of Steve because she was suspicious of him after the police started investigating her. As shown in the SOF, she did change some of her passwords to her accounts so that Steve could not use them. Therefore, the accused’s claim in her mitigation that her better judgement was clouded by her romantic feelings for Steve cannot be given any weight, especially since she was also receiving payments for her assistance in laundering his money. In fact, the same excuses are often made (and invariably rejected by the court) by many other offenders who acted as money-mules in the context of love-scams. In all these cases, the offenders have invariably ignored the red-flags and suspicious nature of the circumstances and allowed themselves to be made used of by their “romantic partners” to launder money. In the present case, the accused has even less of an excuse to be made used of because she was specifically warned by the police about Steve.

31     I also did not entirely agree that the accused was not “_principally motivated by self-intere_st_, benefit, profit or financial gain._”[^12] It has been said that “\[t\]he law has always recognised that motive affects the degree of an offender’s culpability for sentencing purposes. Persons who act out of pure self-interest and greed will rarely be treated with much sympathy”: _Zhao Zhipeng v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGHC 125</span> at \[37\]. In the instant case, the accused admitted that she had received about $3,800 from Steve whom she helped to launder money.[^13] While it may not be a large sum of money, it was certainly not a paltry sum and it showed that the accused in fact received a financial reward for her criminal assistance. I should also point out that the accused in fact received a higher remuneration than the accused in _Ang Jeanette_. Therefore, it cannot be gainsaid that she was not motivated, principally or otherwise, by self-interest or benefit.

32     The fact that the accused received financial benefit greatly undermined the alleged innocence of her actions and demonstrated that she was far from being a trusting and naïve person with no guiles. Furthermore and as noted above, the accused was imprisoned for a year no less on a previous occasion for committing two offences of forgery. Given the length of her previous sentence, the precedent forgery offences would have been serious. In any event, given the nature of those charges, the previous offences would have involved a fair amount of intention, deception and dishonesty. She also committed multiple offences in respect of the present set of charges before she is finally caught and charged for these offences. Given these circumstances, I would not consider her to be a first offender in any sense of the word, notwithstanding that her previous conviction occurred many years ago or that the previous offences were not for money laundering. I would certainly not put her on the same footing as someone who has no prior criminal record and had only committed a one-off offence.

33     Finally, it was raised in mitigation that the accused suffered from ‘Persistent Depressive Disorder’ at the time of the offences.[^14] However, I clarified with Counsel in court and he confirmed that he was not asserting or relying on any causal link between the accused’s psychiatric condition and her commission of the offences. The report did state that her psychiatric condition was a contributory factor in her commission of the offences. However, Counsel did not place any emphasis or rely on this statement either.

34     It has been said that specific deterrence may not be a relevant consideration when sentencing mentally disordered offenders but remains relevant in cases where the offence is premeditated or where there is a conscious choice to commit the offence: _Lim Ghim Peow v Public Prosecutor \[_2014\] 4 SLR 1287 at \[36\]. In the present case, the psychiatric report stated that the accused’s condition was a contributory factor because it caused a failure in her self-control, impulsivity and poor judgment (i.e. risk appraisal and evaluating the possibility that Steve was lying). As I have highlighted above, I would not agree that the accused was lacking in self-control or that she had merely exercised poor judgment. She was clearly suspicious of Steve after she was warned by the police and she exercised sufficient judgment and discernment to start changing her passwords so that Steve could not access her accounts. Looking at the SOF, there can be no doubt that the accused was cognisant of her actions and could balance and weigh the consequences before committing the offences: _Tan Kay Beng v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 10</span> at \[32\].

35     As regards impulsiveness, these were clearly not the type of offences that one would commit out of impulsiveness. This was also not a case of a one-off incident which may be properly attributed to impulsiveness. Therefore, the opinion that her psychiatric condition had caused her to be impulsive has very little meaning and relevance vis-à-vis the commission of these offences. In any event, given Counsel’s stated position in court, I accorded minimal weight, if any, to the accused’s psychiatric condition. Therefore, the principle of specific deterrence remains applicable to the accused.

36     Finally, I find nothing exceptional and mitigating in the personal circumstances of the accused to justify any further reduction of her sentences. Therefore, her personal and family circumstances had little mitigating value. At the end of the day, I did not think that the mitigating factors relied upon by counsel would justify reducing the sentences to the extent sought by Counsel.

### Aggregate Sentence

37     In respect of the aggregate sentence, I ordered the sentences of three charges to run consecutively. The parties agreed that the sentences for the first charge and at least one other s 47(3) charge were to run consecutively. However, Counsel proposed that the third consecutive sentence be that of one of the s 48C(1) charges. The Prosecution submitted for a total of four charges to run consecutively as an alternative approach if the court was to reduce the individual sentences proposed by the Prosecution.

38     In my judgment, I decided that it was entirely appropriate to run the sentences for three of the s 47(3) charges consecutively. This combination of sentences would no doubt have to include the sentence for the first charge since that was the most serious offence and which carried the longest jail sentence. The resulting overall sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment was entirely condign and justified to adequately reflect the accused’s overall criminality and culpability: _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> at \[80\]. I am guided by the High Court’s pronouncement in _Gan Chai Bee Anne v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 4 SLR 838</span> at \[77\] that “\[where\] multiple offences are involved, the most appropriate mechanism for doing so is the consecutive running of multiple sentences”.

39     The accused had committed a staggering total of 50 offences, including the proceeded charges. The s 47(3) charges alone involved a total sum of money which exceeded S$1 million. Apart from the large number of offences and the huge sums of money laundered, I have also considered her significant culpability in the commission of the offences. I am of the firm view that it would not be possible to sufficiently reflect her overall culpability if I were to order the sentences of only two s 47(3) charges to run consecutively. Considering all circumstances and her culpability in the round, I order three of these charges to run consecutively. I would go so far as to add that even if I had ordered four such charges to run consecutively, the aggregate sentence would not have been excessive.

## Conclusion

40     The global sentence that was imposed on the accused is not very far from what Counsel had submitted. At the end of the day, the rationale underpinning the various principles to be considered when determining the global sentence is ultimately that of proportionality in punishment: _Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span>.

41     Bearing this overarching principle in mind, I was satisfied, having regard to all the facts and circumstances of the case, the overall culpability of the accused, the multiplicity of the charges, and applying the sentencing principles of both specific and general deterrence, that the global sentence imposed is by no means excessive and certainly far from crushing.
