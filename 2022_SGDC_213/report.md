13 September 2022

### District Judge Teoh Ai Lin:

1       On 6 January 2020 the accused Muhammad Ramzaan applied to defer his sentence after he was convicted of drug charges and sentenced to three years imprisonment. However he skipped bail and went on to commit a series of drug and traffic offences from 10 January 2020 until his arrest on 26 January 2021. Thereafter he commenced serving sentence for his 6 January 2020 convictions.

2       On 25 July 2022, he pleaded guilty before me to his fresh offences, comprising 14 proceeded charges with another 14 charges taken into consideration, and asked the court to commence his sentences immediately.

3       I sentenced the accused to a total of five years and twenty-seven days’ imprisonment to commence on the expiry of the sentence he was serving. He has appealed the sentence.

## The Charges

### Overview of charges

4       The 14 proceeded charges and 14 charges taken into consideration comprised five drug charges committed in 2021 and 23 road traffic offences committed in 2019 and 2020 before and after his 6 January 2020 court convictions (“Jan 2020 drug convictions”).

5       Three of the 14 proceeded charges were for drug offences. They comprised one charge each for enhanced drug consumption, enhanced drug possession and failure to report for urine test. The remaining 11 proceeded charges were for road traffic offences - seven charges for speeding, and one charge each for driving without reasonable consideration, failing to stop after accident, failing to render assistance and beating the red lights.

6       As for the 14 charges taken into consideration (“TIC”), two were for failing to report for urine test, 11 were for speeding, and one for failing to file report of traffic accident.

### Sentences

## Parties’ submissions on sentence

### Prosecution’s submissions

9       Prosecution submitted that the LT1 drug consumption and FRUT charges should be run consecutively, for a global sentence of between five years’ four months to five years’ six months imprisonment to commence upon the expiry of the sentence the accused was serving. Fines should be imposed with 24 months’ disqualification for each of the three charges of driving without reasonable consideration, failing to stop and failing to render assistance (25th,26th and 28th charges).

### Defence submissions

10     Counsel submitted that the individual sentences proposed by Prosecution appeared reasonable. He agreed with prosecution that the LT1 drug consumption charge and the FRUT charge should run consecutively.

11     However counsel submitted that the global sentence of 5 years and 4 months should commence forthwith. Applying the totality principle in _PP v Hang Tuah bin Jumaat_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 2 SLR 527</span> (_“Hang Tuah”_) and _PP v Azman bin Abdul Karim_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 276</span> (_“Azman”_), the accused would effectively receive a sentence of 6 years 10 months’ imprisonment if the sentences were ordered to commence forthwith, as the accused had already served 1 year 6 months of his previous sentence at the time of sentencing.

12     In mitigation counsel submitted that in January 2020 the accused’s fiancée was expecting and he applied to defer sentence to spend time with his family, but ran into personal and financial difficulties for the child’s delivery and unwisely absconded. He was living under fear and could not work and relapsed into drugs. He has pleaded guilty and was remorseful and had saved resources for all concerned.

### Issues

13     Based on the parties’ submissions, the main contention related to when the sentence should be ordered to commence.

14     I will first deal with the sentences for the individual charges before dealing with the global sentence and when the sentence should commence.

## Drug charges

### Facts relating to the three proceeded drug charges

15     The drug charges were the last in the series of offences committed by the accused after absconding from bail and before he was arrested on 26 January 2021.

16     On 26 January 2021 at about 12.20pm, officers of the Central Narcotics Bureau arrested the accused at Block 645 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6 #XXX, Singapore 560645 (“the Incident Location”). Upon his arrest, two packets containing crystalline substance (later marked as exhibit “R-2”) were seized at the Incident Location.

17     A Warrant of Arrest had been issued against the accused as he was previously convicted on 6 January 2020 for drug offences, but had failed to turn up to commence serving his sentence after applying for a deferment of the same. The accused had been sentenced to three years’ imprisonment, which eventually commenced on 26 January 2021 after his arrest for these offences.

18     The accused admitted to ownership and having in his possession the seized exhibit. The accused was subsequently escorted back to Woodlands Police Divisional Headquarters for further investigations.

##### Facts pertaining to the 1st charge – LT1 drug consumption (DAC 914927-2021)

19     Following his arrest on 26 January 2021, the accused provided two bottles of his urine sample which were marked as “C-SL-21-01220-1 MUHAMMAD RAMZAAN S/O AKHBAR SXXX” and “C-SL-21-01220-2 MUHAMMAD RAMZAAN S/O AKHBAR SXXX” and sealed ‘CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU’ in his presence. On 27 January 2021, the said urine samples were sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA") for analysis.

20     On 2 February 2021, the HSA issued two Certificates bearing Lab. No. 2101618-AT-001 and Lab. No. 2101618-AT-002 under s 16 of the MDA, in relation to the analysis of the accused’s urine samples:

> (a)     Analyst Zhang HuiFen Hannah, of the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of the HSA, having conduct of the analysis in relation to the urine sample marked as “C-SL-21-01220-1 MUHAMMAD RAMZAAN S/O AKHBAR SXXX” issued the Certificate bearing Lab. No. 2101618-AT-001, stating that on analysis, the said urine sample was found to contain Methamphetamine.

> (b)     Analyst Ong Han Hui Jordan, of the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of the HSA, having conduct of the analysis in relation to the urine sample marked as “C-SL-21-01220-2 MUHAMMAD RAMZAAN S/O AKHBAR SXXX” issued the Certificate bearing Lab. No. 2101618-AT-002, stating that on analysis, the said urine sample was found to contain Methamphetamine.

21     Methamphetamine is a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”).

22     During the course of his investigations, the accused admitted to consuming “Sejuk” (street name of Methamphetamine), and that he last consumed it prior to his arrest whilst in the toilet of the Incident Location. The accused used an improvised glass instrument and a rubber tube to consume Methamphetamine. He would consume the drug about three to four times a week, using 0.1g of Methamphetamine on each occasion. The accused consumed Methamphetamine because it made him feel “active”, and would purchase 0.5g of Methamphetamine for S$50 from a male Malay known to him as “Ahboy”.

23     The accused’s urine samples contained Methamphetamine as a result of his consumption of the same.

24     The accused was not authorized under the MDA or the regulations made thereunder to consume Methamphetamine, a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA. The accused has thereby committed an offence under s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA.

25     Further, prior to the commission of the said offence, the accused was on 29 January 2018, pursuant to an order made by the Director of the Central Narcotics Bureau in Singapore under s 34(2)(b) of the MDA, admitted to an approved institution, namely, Changi Prison Complex / Drug Rehabilitation Centre, for the consumption of a specified drug (Methamphetamine), and was on 6 January 2020, in District Court 11A vide DAC 934931-2019, convicted of an offence for the failure to provide specimen of urine for urine test under s 31(2) of the MDA, which offence is punishable under s33(4AA) of the MDA, and sentenced to three years’ imprisonment. The accused’s admission and conviction have not been set aside to date, and the accused shall now be punished under s 33A(1) of the MDA.

##### Facts pertaining to the 2nd charge – Enhanced drug possession (DAC- 914928-2021)

26     On 29 January 2021, the exhibit marked “R-2” was sealed “CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU” and submitted to Illicit Drugs Laboratory of the HSA for analysis. On 26 February 2021, Jesslyn Oh Su Yun, an analyst of the Illicit Drug Laboratory of the HSA, issued a certificate bearing Lab. No.: 2101859-ID-001 under s 16 of the MDA, stating that the exhibit marked “R-2” was found to be two packets containing a total of not less than 0.54g of crystalline substance, which was analysed and found to contain not less than 0.36g of Methamphetamine.

27     During the course of investigations, the accused admitted to ownership and having in his possession exhibit “R-2”. He further admitted that the drug was in his possession for his own consumption.

28     Methamphetamine is a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA. The accused was not authorized under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to have in his possession the controlled drug. The accused has thereby committed an offence under s 8(a) of the MDA.

29     Further, prior to the commission of the offence, the accused was on 6 January 2020, in District Court 11A vide DAC-934932-2019, in Singapore, convicted on an offence of possession of a controlled drug under s 8(a) of the MDA and sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment, which conviction has not been set aside to date. The accused shall therefore be punished with enhanced punishment under s 33(1) of the MDA.

##### Facts pertaining to the 5th charge – Failing to report for urine test (“FRUT”) (DAC 914931-2021)

30     On 3 January 2019, the accused was placed under compulsory supervision for a period of 24 months, with effect from 28 January 2019 to 27 January 2021, by virtue of Regulation 15 of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (Reg 3, 1999 Rev Ed) (“MDR”).

31     Pursuant to Regulation 15(3)(f) of the MDR, during the period of supervision, the accused was required to present himself for urine tests at Jurong Police Divisional Headquarters on every Thursday of each month from 9.30am to 10.00pm, except on public holidays.

32     The accused contravened the said Regulation when he failed to present himself for his urine test on 21 January 2021 (Thursday) at Jurong Police Divisional Headquarters, CNB office. The accused did not have any valid reason for his failure to report for urine test.

33     The accused has thereby committed an offence under reg 15(3)(f) r/w reg 15(6)(a) of the MDR.

### Sentencing considerations for the drug charges

34     The LT1 drug consumption and enhanced drug possession charges carried mandatory minimum sentences of 5 years’ jail and 3 strokes of the cane, and 2 years’ jail respectively.

35     The accused had committed these drug offences whilst on the run from the law after skipping bail for his Jan 2020 drug convictions, which was an aggravating factor. The accused had also been caught red-handed with the drugs in his possession and both his urine samples had tested positive. The MDA presumptions would apply, and the mitigating weight of his guilty plea was reduced. He also had a recent January 2020 drug possession conviction for which he had been sentenced to eight months’ jail.

36     However in his favour I considered that the accused had admitted to possession and consumption of drugs during investigations,[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) pleaded guilty and saved the courts’ time and resources. For the drug possession charge, I also considered the small quantity of drugs involved comprising 2 packets of 0.54g of crystalline substance containing not less than 0.36g Methamphetamine, which were for his personal consumption. This was also his first LT1 drug consumption charge.

37     Prosecution asked for the mandatory minimum sentences for offences. I agreed that mandatory minimum sentences were appropriate and imposed them accordingly.

38     For the FRUT offence, prosecution had asked for between four to six months’ jail. As the court in _PP v Radika d\\o Rajavarma_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 190</span> observed from the High Court decisions, the usual sentencing range for a first-time offender of a FRUT charge is a sentence of between four to six months jail: at \[20\]. In this case I considered that there was one proceeded FRUT charge with another two FRUT charges taken into consideration, and all three FRUT offences were committed in January 2021. This was also the accused’s first FRUT offence and his guilty plea had saved the courts’ time and resources. In my view a four-month jail sentence was sufficient punishment and I imposed it accordingly.

## Traffic offences

39     The 11 proceeded traffic charges were committed in 2019 and 2020 and comprised seven speeding charges, and one charge each for failing to conform to red lights, driving without reasonable consideration, failing to stop after accident and failing to render assistance.

### Facts relating to the 11 proceeded traffic offences

##### Facts pertaining to the 8th charge (DAC 919942- 2021) - Failing to conform to red lights

40     On 27 July 2019 at about 6.19 am, at the junction of Jurong West Avenue 2 and Jurong West Street 23, while driving towards Pan Island Expressway, the motor vehicle bearing licence plate no: SJS 5852 G failed to conform to the traffic red light signal. This was captured by the Traffic Red Light Surveillance camera at the aforementioned junction.

41     Investigations revealed that the accused (who owned the aforementioned vehicle) was the driver of the vehicle at the material time, and that he had failed to conform to the traffic red light signal.

42     By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has thereby committed the offence under s120(4) and punishable under s 131(2)(a) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) (“RTA”).

##### Facts pertaining to the 9th, 11th, 12th, 14th, 18th, 19th and 24th charges – Seven Speeding charges

43     On the following seven occasions, the accused drove a motor vehicle on a road at a speed which exceeded the speed limit of the road:

This speed was in excess of the imposed speed limit of the road, **which was 60km/h**. The accused’s act was captured by a speed camera.

44     The accused has thereby committed **seven counts of the offence of speeding**, an offence under s 63(4) and punishable under s 131(2)(a) of the RTA.

##### Facts pertaining to the 25th, 26th and 28th charges (DAC 921103, 921104 and 921106 of 2021) – Driving without reasonable consideration, failing to stop after accident, failing to render assistance

45     At the time of these offences, the accused was the driver of the motor car bearing licence plate no.: SKT2365Z, which he had rented from a car rental company.

46     The complainant and victim is Sakthivel Kunasegaran, a 29-year-old male Singaporean. He was the driver of the motor car bearing licence plate no.: SMG3347P at the material time.

47     On 23 May 2020 at about 10.15am, along Balestier Road, Singapore, the accused was driving the above-mentioned motor car without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road. He failed to keep a proper lookout ahead of his vehicle and, as a result, collided into the rear of the victim’s motor car. The collision resulted in damage being caused to the victim’s motor car — there were scratches on the rear-left of the motor car, with the rear bumper slightly dislodged.

48     However, despite causing the accident, the accused failed to stop his motor car after the accident. He instead drove off, failing to render such assistance as was reasonable in his power to render.

49     Following the accident, a Notice to Furnish Driver’s Particulars was sent to the registered owner of the motor car SKT2365Z. This led to the identification of the accused as being the driver of the aforementioned motor car at the time of the offences.

50     Further, before committing of the offence of driving without reasonable consideration, the accused had, on 23 March 2015, been convicted in the Subordinate Court of Singapore, for an offence under s 65(a) of the RTA vide DAC 903220/15, which conviction has not been set aside till date.

51     The accused has thereby committed the following offences:

> (a)     One count of driving without reasonable consideration, an offence under s65(1)(b) and punishable under s 65(5)(b) of the RTA,

> (b)     One count of failing to stop after an accident, an offence under s 84(1)(a) read with s 84(7) and punishable under s 131(2)(a) of the RTA, and

> (c)     One count of failing to render assistance after an accident, an offence under s84(3) read with s 84(7) and punishable under s 131(2)(a) of the RTA.

52     The accused admits to the above offences, and is charged accordingly.

### Sentencing considerations for the speeding and red lights offences

53     Prosecution did not wish to make submissions on sentences for these charges.

54     These offences carried a maximum fine of $1000, jail of up to three months, and were compoundable offences. For untraced offenders who pleaded guilty in court, the tariff for failing to conform to red lights was a fine in the region of $500 to $700, in default two to four days’ imprisonment. The starting tariff for a first offender who pleaded guilty in court to speeding would be a fine of $500 to $600, in default two to three days’ imprisonment, with the tariff increasing with higher excess speeds.

55     I took into account the accused’s traffic-related antecedents. He had two series of court convictions for traffic offences. In 2014, he was fined a total of $2200 for _three_ proceeded charges - two of driving without licence and one of taking a vehicle without owner’s consent, with another three traffic-related charges taken into consideration. A year later in 2015, he was convicted of _five_ traffic offences: one charge each for drink-driving, driving without due care, driving without insurance and two charges of driving without licence, with another two charges taken into consideration. He was fined a total of $5600, and disqualification orders of 18 months, 12 months and 2 months were imposed for the drink-driving, insurance and driving without due care offences respectively.

56     Aside from the court convictions, the accused had also committed speeding offences for which he received composition fines. In October 2017, he had driven in excess speeds of 41 to 50 kmph, and the offence was compounded for $620. In April 2020 a composition fine of $200 was imposed for speeding in excess of 21 to 30 kmph.

57     In addition, the records showed that after his arrest in January 2021, the accused was convicted and fined in court on 26 April 2021, 2nd July 2021 and 16 August 2021 for a lengthy list of parking and other traffic-related offences that ran into several pages long and total default sentences of at least 95 days imprisonment were imposed.

58     Of the 11 proceeded traffic offences, the accused committed five of them between July to October 2019 at a time _after_ he committed the drug offences on 20 July 2019 forming the subject-matter of his Jan 2020 drug convictions, and six of them between May to July 2020 _after_ he had absconded from bail for his Jan 2020 drug convictions.

59     All seven speeding charges involved the accused driving at speeds in excess of 30kmph, and in two of these proceeded charges he had exceeded the speed limit by 43kmph and 50 kmph. Another 11 of the charges taken into consideration were also for speeding at various excess speeds of up to 28kmph.

60     It was clear that the accused had scant regard for speed limits and traffic rules despite the punishment meted out for his traffic antecedents, and his penchant for driving at excessive speeds of even up to 50kmph posed a real and potential danger to other road users. Deterrence in particular specific deterrence would be the dominant sentencing consideration. I was minded to impose stiff deterrent fines of $800 for beating the red lights, and $1000 for the speeding offences.

61     However the accused was unable to pay any fine. When it is clear that an offender is unable to pay a fine, a fine should not be imposed: _Low Meng Chay v PP_ \[1993\] 1SLR (R ) 46 at \[13\]. Default terms of imprisonment were intended to prevent evasion of the payment of fines imposed, and not to punish those who were genuinely unable to pay. I therefore imposed short imprisonment terms of three days’ imprisonment for the offence of failing to conform to red lights, and four days’ imprisonment for each of the speeding offences.

### Sentencing considerations for the charges relating to collision on 23rd May 2020

62     Prosecution submitted that the accused’s driving history showed his recalcitrance and disregard for road safety and traffic rules, and that road users had to be protected from his belligerent attitude towards driving. After referring to some unreported decisions they submitted for the following sentences:

> (a)     fine $2000 and 24 months disqualification for driving without reasonable consideration, and

> (b)     fine $1000 and 24 months disqualification each for failing to stop and to render assistance.

63     I noted that the accused was a repeat offender for the driving without reasonable consideration charge, which was not compoundable. He had been convicted of a similar offence of driving without due care and consideration under section 65(a) Road Traffic Act in March 2015, fined $800 and received a two-month disqualification order. As he was a repeat offender the offence carried a sentence of fine not exceeding $3000 or jail of up to 12 months. The charges for failing to stop and to render assistance carried maximum fines of $1000 or jail term of up to three months.

#### Disqualification orders

64     The court in _Edwin s\\ Suse Nathan v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 4 SLR 1139</span> which involved an accused facing a drink-driving charge, highlighted that a driving disqualification order combines the three sentencing objectives of punishment, protection of the public and deterrence. The two components of a sentence of fine or jail and disqualification are not mutually compensatory and an increase in fine or jail should not be taken to mandate the imposition of a reduced period of disqualification. Where an offence reflects a blatant disregard for the safety of other road users and a lack of personal responsibility, there is a public interest in getting the offender off the roads for a substantial period and deterrence would also be served by sounding a warning that a lengthy disqualification can be expected: at \[13\] and \[14\].

65     These principles were reiterated in the recent case _of Kwan Weiguang v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGHC 121</span>. The court observed that the imposition of disqualification takes effect above and beyond the primary sentence of an imprisonment term or fine, and a sufficiently lengthy disqualification order reminds an offender every day of his offence and that he is not permitted to drive because of his bad behaviour. It is disqualification rather than a fine that a motorist fears most: at \[59\] to \[62\].

66     In this case the accused was a recalcitrant traffic offender who had shown ample disregard for traffic rules and the safety of other road users. His driving without reasonable consideration had also resulted in a rear-end collision and damage to another vehicle. He had then fled the scene but was identified through a notice to furnish particulars sent to the registered owner. In my view the accused had exhibited a high degree of culpability. His guilty plea had saved the courts’ time and resources but would carry limited weight as a mitigating factor in these circumstances. There was also nothing offered by way of the mitigation submitted by counsel for any of the traffic offences he committed. The disqualification orders should not only punish but be of sufficient length to keep him off the roads for the protection of the public and for deterrence.

67     Prosecution’s submissions on the fine quantums were fair. The disqualification orders for the individual offences should be calibrated to the relative seriousness of the offences and the offence and offender specific factors, and particularly that the accused was a repeat offender for the driving without reasonable consideration charge. As the accused was unable to pay any fine, I imposed eight days’ imprisonment and 20 months’ disqualification for the driving without reasonable consideration charge, and four days’ imprisonment and 12 months’ disqualification for each of the failing to stop and failing to render assistance charges.

## When should the sentences commence?

68     In this case the primary sentencing consideration was deterrence, in particular specific deterrence for both the drug and traffic-related offences.

69     As regards the traffic offences, running the beating the red lights charge, three of the speeding charges, and the driving without reasonable consideration and failing to stop charges consecutively would in my view sufficiently reflect his criminality for the traffic offences he had committed. In addition, considering the length of the LT1 drug offence and that it carried caning, I was of the view that running the LT1 drug consumption charge with these six traffic-related offences would be sufficient punishment and deterrence, and reflect the overall criminality of the accused in his latest spate of offending involving both drug and traffic offences. It would not be necessary to run the sentence for the FRUT offence consecutively.

70     As for the commencement of the sentences, the accused was serving a total of three years’ imprisonment for his Jan 2020 drug convictions: three years’ mandatory minimum imprisonment on one charge of failing to provide urine specimen and eight months’ imprisonment on one charge of drug possession, with one charge of possession of drug utensils taken into consideration, which had been ordered to run concurrently.

### Legal principles on commencement of sentence

71     Under section 322(1) Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed), where a person undergoing a sentence of imprisonment is again sentenced to imprisonment, the latter imprisonment sentence must begin either immediately or at the end of the previous sentence. In _Hang Tuah_, the High Court stated that the court’s discretion as to when sentence is to commence must be exercised judiciously: at \[25\]. The court should have regard to whether the subsequent offences arose in the same transaction as the earlier offences and also the totality of the sentence to be served.

72     The fact that the subsequent offences arose in different transactions is a weighty consideration that warrants the imposition of an order that the sentence should start at the expiration of the earlier term of imprisonment. The court ultimately has a primary duty to determine the appropriate sentence which would best ensure that the ends of justice are met, and no single consideration can conclusively determine the proper sentence and the court must balance many factors sometimes rejecting some. One factor that should be considered is whether the totality of the sentence served is proportionate to the inherent gravity of all the offences committed. The cumulative effect of the sentences should not be disproportionate to the overall criminality of the accused. Finally in contemplating the totality of the sentences imposed, the court should consider the question if all the offences had been before the court, would the court still have passed a sentence of similar length. If not, the court should adjust the sentence imposed for the latest offence to run consecutively with the earlier sentence or order the sentence to commence immediately: at \[27\], \[33\] to \[34\].

### Application of the principles

73     The accused had served about 18 months of his three-year sentence for his Jan 2020 drug convictions at the time of sentencing. Prosecution submitted that if the sentences were ordered to commence immediately, he would be receiving an unwarranted 50% discount on his three-year imprisonment sentence. Based on his earliest date of release on 15 March 2023, effectively he would receive a discount of about eight months

74     If the sentences were ordered to run upon the expiry of the sentence the accused was serving, the accused would receive a total imprisonment sentence of eight years and 27 days imprisonment. If the sentences were ordered to commence immediately, it would run concurrently with his remaining term and the accused’s total imprisonment sentence was five years, 18 months and 27 days.

75     Applying the _Hang Tuah_ principles, I noted that all the January 2021 drug charges before me related to offences committed in distinct and separate transactions from the earlier drug offences the accused committed in July 2019, some one and a half years prior. The 11 proceeded traffic offences were not only distinct offences involving the protection of different legal interests, all of them were committed either in 2019 after his arrest for the July 2019 drug offences or in 2020 after had absconded from bail. The offences before me arose in different transactions from his previous offending, and this was therefore a weighty consideration that warranted the imposition of a term of imprisonment to commence upon the expiry of the imprisonment term the accused was serving.

76     Nevertheless the totality principle required the court to ensure that the overall sentence was proportionate and not crushing. As guided by the court in _Hang Tuah_, the court should consider whether the totality of the sentence served is proportionate to the inherent gravity of all the offences committed, and in contemplating the totality principle, consider whether the court would still have passed a sentence of similar length if all the offences had been before the court,

77     Similar to the present accused, the offender in _Azman’s_ case had been sentenced for drug offences but absconded after applying to defer sentence, and he went on to commit further drug and other offences.

78      _Azman_ had been convicted in February 2015 and sentenced to a total imprisonment term of seven years, 5 months and two weeks’ imprisonment for LT2 drug consumption and trafficking, with one charge of possession of drug utensils taken into consideration. Then in November 2020 he was sentenced to a further seven years and 18 months imprisonment for fresh offences committed when he was on the run. His two fresh charges were for LT2 drug consumption and attempting to cause hurt to a police office, with one drug possession and two possession of drug utensil charges taken into consideration. The court ordered the sentences to commence on the expiry of the sentence he was serving, and the accused thus received a global imprisonment term of 14 years, 23 months and two weeks’ imprisonment.

79     His appeal against sentence was dismissed. The court had considered the serious nature of all the offences committed and concluded that it would not be disproportionate to run both LT2 sentences consecutively if all the offences had been before the court, and observed that ordering the sentences to run immediately would have given the accused a discount of two years and effectively reduce the mandatory minimum sentence for his earlier LT2 offence to less than the mandated seven years imprisonment: at \[114\] to \[116\].

80     In the present case, it was aggravating that the accused had committed numerous fresh offences while on the run and these included serious drug offences despite his Jan 2020 drug convictions. In total seventeen of the twenty-eight proceeded and TIC charges were committed in 2020 and 2021 after he absconded from bail.

81     All the 14 proceeded charges concerned the invasion of distinct legally protected interests and his drug offences were serious offences. Overall I found his criminality high. Two of the three drug charges in the fresh offending carried minimum sentences - five years and three strokes for LT1 drug consumption and two years for enhanced drug possession. His 2020 conviction for failing to provide urine sample also carried a mandatory minimum of three years’ imprisonment. He would effectively receive an eight-month discount from the mandated minimum three-year sentence if the sentences were ordered to commence immediately. As for his spate of fresh traffic offences, they had been committed despite his numerous traffic antecedents and his disregard for traffic rules had posed a danger to other road users. I had also not run the four-month imprisonment sentence for the FRUT offence consecutively as prosecution had urged. Considering the foregoing and that his five proceeded drug charges had been committed over two distinct time periods, if the accused had appeared before me on all charges I would have ordered a sentence of similar length to commensurate with his criminality. In my view the aggregate sentence was proportionate to the inherent gravity of all the offences he had committed and ordering the sentences to commence upon expiry of his present imprisonment term was not excessive or crushing, and not in keeping with the accused’s past record and future prospects.

## Conclusion

82     I therefore ordered the total sentence of five years and twenty-seven days’ imprisonment, three strokes of the cane and twenty months disqualification upon release to commence upon the expiry of the sentence the accused was serving.
