### District Judge Christopher Tan Pheng Wee:

1       The Accused is a 26-year-old male. He pleaded guilty to the following two charges:

> (a)     one charge under s 326 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”) for voluntarily causing grievous hurt with a multi-purpose knife, which the Accused used to stab the victim’s chest (“Section 326 Charge”); and

> (b)     one charge under s 7(1)(a) of the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act (Cap 65, 2013 Rev Ed) (“CESOWA”), for possessing a scheduled weapon, _ie_, a _parang_ with a blade measuring 20cm (“CESOWA Charge”).

2       I sentenced him as follows:

> (a)     three years and nine months’ imprisonment with six strokes of the cane for the Section 326 Charge; and

> (b)     eight months’ imprisonment with six strokes of the cane for the CESOWA charge.

I ordered both sentences to run concurrently, giving rise to a global sentence of three years and nine months’ imprisonment with 12 strokes of the cane.

3       I also ordered the sentence to commence on expiry of the imprisonment term that the Accused was currently serving for offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, Rev Ed 2008) (“MDA”).

4       The Accused, who remains in prison, has appealed against his sentence.

## Facts

5       The facts of this case, as gleaned from the Statement of Facts (to which the Accused admitted without qualification), are set out below.

6       The victim is the Accused’s stepbrother. On 9 July 2018, at about 5pm, the victim called the Accused over the phone and asked if the Accused wanted to join the victim to play games. The phone connection became intermittent and neither party could hear the other. This gave rise to some unhappiness on both sides which escalated into a dispute over the phone. The conversation ended with the Accused and the victim agreeing to meet.

7       As the Accused left the house to meet the victim, he spotted a _parang_ with a blade measuring approximately 20cm in length. The Accused slotted the _parang_ into the side of his trousers and made his way to the appointment with the victim. The _parang_ formed the subject of CESOWA Charge:

> You … are charged that you, on the 9th day of July 2018, at or about 5.11pm, at the pavement infront of Block 418 Bedok North Avenue 2, Singapore, did have in your possession scheduled weapon, to wit, a parang with blade measuring 20cm in length, otherwise than with lawful authority or for lawful purpose, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 7(1)(a) of the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act … .

Apart from the _parang_, the Accused also brought along two other knives: a multi-purpose knife and a Swiss knife.

8       The Accused travelled to the venue of his appointment with the victim in a Grab vehicle which the victim had booked for him. Upon arrival, as the Accused stepped out of the vehicle, the victim threw a ten dollar note at him so that the Accused could pay the Grab driver. The Accused jumped towards the victim and a scuffle ensued. Intending to cause grievous hurt, the Accused used the multi-purpose knife to stab and slash the victim. This formed the subject of the Section 326 Charge:

> You … are charged that you, on 9 July 2018 at about 5.43pm, at the vicinity of Block 421, Bedok North Road Avenue 2, Singapore did voluntarily cause grievous hurt to one Muhammad Khairi Bin Sa Ari by means of an instrument which, used as a weapon of offence, is likely to cause death, to wit, by stabbing and slashing him in the chest region with a multi-purpose knife, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 326 of the Penal Code …

The Accused then walked away and disposed of the _parang_.

9       That same night, the victim sought treatment at the Changi General Hospital Emergency Department. The attack by the Accused left the victim with the following injuries:

> (a)     undisplaced fractures of the lateral aspect of the left sixth to eighth ribs;

> (b)     A laceration measuring 1.5 to 2cm at the left lower lateral chest, over the sixth to eighth ribs; and

> (c)     Soft tissue haematoma with air pockets in the left lower chest wall and left lateral abdominal wall / hypochondrium.

The next day, the victim underwent exploration of the left chest wall stab wound and evacuation of the chest wall haematoma, with toilet and suture of the left chest wound. Intra-operatively, a left chest wall stab wound was noted at the lateral chest wall region around the fifth to sixth ribs. A 5cm laceration of the external intercostal muscle was observed, with a large chest wall haematoma, but the laceration did not enter the internal intercostal muscle. The haematoma was evacuated from the chest wall manually and haemostasis was established. The wound was then cleaned and closed with sutures.

10     After the operation, the victim was given two days of hospitalization leave and 15 days of medical leave thereafter.

11     The above offences were committed just seven days after the Accused had pleaded guilty to, and was awaiting sentencing for, various charges under the MDA. Specifically, on 2 July 2018, the Accused pleaded guilty to the following three charges (collectively referred to as the “MDA Charges”):

> (a)     one charge under s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA for consuming monoacetylmorphine (“LT1 Charge”);

> (b)     one charge under s 8(a) of the MDA for possessing diamorphine; and

> (c)     one charge under s 9 of the MDA for possessing utensils for drug consumption.

12     Sentencing for the MDA Charges was adjourned and the Accused was released on bail in the interim. A week after that, on 9 July 2018, the Accused committed the offences in the two charges before me, as described above. On 12 July 2018, the court remanded the Accused at the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) for psychiatric examination. That examination culminated in a psychiatric report (“IMH Report”) which the Defence tendered before me.

13     On 7 May 2019, the Accused was sentenced for the MDA Charges as follows:

The imprisonment terms for the LT1 Charge and the charge under s 9 of the MDA were ordered to run consecutively, giving rise to a global sentence of five years and three months’ imprisonment (with effect from the Accused’s remand on 12 July 2018) with three strokes of the cane.

14     As such, when the Accused appeared before me for sentencing on 24 February 2020, he was already serving sentence for the MDA Charges.

## Antecedents

15     Apart from his conviction for the MDA Charges, the Accused was previously convicted of motor vehicle theft in May 2009, for which he was sent to the juvenile home. Between 2012 and 2016, he was placed in the Drug Rehabilitation Centre twice for unauthorised drug consumption.

## Parties’ Submissions on Sentence

16     I now move to the parties’ submissions pertaining to the appropriate sentence, as well as _when_ that sentence should be ordered to commence.

### Appropriate Sentence

17     The Prosecution submitted that the following sentences should be imposed:

> (a)     Four years’ imprisonment with six strokes of the cane for the Section 326 Charge; and

> (b)     Eight months’ imprisonment with six strokes of the cane for the CESOWA Charge,

with both imprisonment terms to run concurrently, thereby giving rise to a global sentence of four years’ imprisonment with 12 strokes of the cane. The Defence, on its part, did not object to the Prosecution’s submissions on the appropriate number of strokes.

18     The Defence, on its part, asked that a global custodial duration of no more than four years be imposed for the two charges before me.[^1]

19     The Defence claimed that during the telephone conversation between the Accused and the victim prior to their meeting, the victim used vulgarities to scold the Accused’s parents.[^2] When the Accused subsequently made his way to the meeting with the victim, he brought along the _parang_, multi-purpose knife and Swiss knife but harboured no intentions to injure the victim with those items.[^3] Rather, the Defence explained as follows:

> (a)     The Accused brought the _parang_ merely to protect himself from the victim.[^4] Specifically, it was unusual for the victim to have booked a Grab vehicle to fetch the Accused to their meeting, as the victim had not done this before. The Accused thus had cause to fear that the victim was going to hurt him. This was especially so, given the altercation that had just occurred over the phone.

> (b)     As for the multi-purpose knife and Swiss knife, the Defence claimed that the Accused carried these around as he needed them to perform his job.[^5] Specifically, the Accused used these knives to cut the straps of boxes at the airport cargo complex, where he worked.[^6]

As such, the Accused could not be said to have carried these items with the premeditated intention of injuring the Accused.

20     The Defence also claimed that the Accused was on crutches when he met the victim. Due to the Accused’s disability, he was unable to alight quickly from the Grab vehicle.[^7] Despite this, the victim rushed forward to attack the Accused.7 Specifically, the victim yanked the Accused out of the Grab vehicle and this triggered the scuffle.7 In the initial mitigation plea, the Defence contended that the Accused “did not intentionally injure the victim”.[^8] Upon my probing as to whether this qualified the plea, the Defence withdrew this contention6 and filed an amended mitigation plea.

21     During the hearing before me, the Accused also addressed the court personally, pleading for leniency and claiming that he suffered from depression. This claim was supported by the IMH Report adduced by the Defence, which stated[^9] that the Accused had been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder.

22     Despite the Prosecution’s agreement with the Defence on the appropriate custodial duration, the Prosecution still took issue with various aspects of the mitigation:

> (a)     The Prosecution questioned the veracity of the Defence’s explanations for why the Accused had brought the _parang_, multi-purpose knife and Swiss knife along when meeting the victim.10

> (b)     The Prosecution also disputed the claim that the victim rushed up and attacked the Accused while the latter was on crutches and alighting from the Grab vehicle. The Prosecution contended that this version of facts was not borne out by investigations.[^10]

23     Finally, the Prosecution highlighted that the Accused’s mental condition had no contributory link to the offences.

### Commencement Date of Sentence

24     While the submissions for both the Prosecution and Defence as regards the appropriate custodial term appeared to converge at the four-year mark, they diverged sharply as regards _when_ that custodial term should commence. As mentioned, the Accused was serving his imprisonment term for the MDA Charges when he appeared before me. On that:

> (a)     The Defence argued that the sentence imposed by me should commence immediately (_ie_, from 24 February 2020), so that part of it runs concurrently with the imprisonment term for the MDA Charges.

> (b)     The Prosecution contended that the sentence should commence only upon expiry of the imprisonment term for the MDA Charges.

## Decision

25     I sentenced the Accused as follows:

> (a)     three years and nine months’ imprisonment with six strokes of the cane for the Section 326 Charge; and

> (b)     eight months’ imprisonment with six strokes of the cane for the CESOWA charge.

The sentences were ordered to run concurrently, giving rise to a global imprisonment term of three years and nine months’ imprisonment with 12 strokes of the cane.

26     I also ordered for the sentence imposed by me to commence on expiry of the imprisonment term for the MDA Charges.

27     I give my reasons below.

### Appropriate Sentence for the Section 326 Charge

28     In arriving at my decision on the appropriate sentence for the Section 326 Charge, I drew guidance from the case of _Ng Soon Kim v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 247</span> (“_Ng Soon Kim_”). That case dealt with the offence of causing **hurt** with a dangerous weapon (under s 324 of the Penal Code), as opposed to the present case, which involved causing **grievous hurt** with a dangerous weapon. Nevertheless, _Ng Soon Kim’s_ methodology for sentencing was still highly apposite here. In _Ng Soon Kim_, Sundaresh Menon CJ held (at \[12\]) that the appropriate sentence could be derived via a three-step process:

> (a)     Under the first step, the court determines the notional starting sentence had the case been one of voluntarily causing hurt _simpliciter_ (_ie_, under s 323 of the Penal Code).

> (b)     Under the second step, the court adds an uplift to the starting sentence derived under the first step, to account for the egregiousness of the dangerous weapon or means used to inflict the hurt.

> (c)     Under the third step, the court calibrates the final sentence according to the aggravating and mitigating factors at play.

29     Menon CJ explained the need for a discrete second step in the sentencing process outlined above. His Honour noted that even though the same injury could subsist for offences under both s 323 (where no weapon is involved) and s 324 (where a weapon was used), the maximum imprisonment term under s 323 is only two years, while that under s 324 is seven years (see _Ng Soon Kim_ at \[9\]). The employment of a dangerous weapon or means therefore triggers a jump in the maximum punishment. The egregiousness of that dangerous weapon or means should consequently be analysed under a distinct step in the sentencing process (and not lumped under a single harm/culpability continuum).

30     The sentencing process in _Ng Soon Kim_, while fashioned for offences under s 324 of the Penal Code, can be seamlessly transposed to the s 326 context. The nature of the harm in both offences is the same, _ie_, physical injury to the victim. Both are aggravated offences, where the aggravating element is the same, _ie_, the employment of a dangerous weapon or means. Adapting the three-step process in _Ng Soon Kim_ to the present case, this court would need to go through the following steps:

> (a)     Determine the notional starting sentence had the case been one of voluntarily causing **grievous hurt** _simpliciter_ (_ie_, under s 325 of the Penal Code).

> (b)     Add an uplift to that starting sentence, to account for the egregiousness of the dangerous weapon or means employed.

> (c)     Calibrate the final sentence according to the aggravating and mitigating circumstances.

31     During the hearing before me, I asked the Prosecution to explain the custodial duration that it was proposing, _ie_, four years, using the sentencing methodology in _Ng Soon Kim_. The Prosecution responded as follows:[^11]

> (a)     Had the case been one of voluntarily causing **grievous hurt** _simpliciter_, the starting custodial term would have been three years and six months.

> (b)     The multi-purpose knife used to stab the victim merited a custodial uplift of six months. Adding this to the starting custodial term of three years and six months (derived under the first step above) gave rise to a custodial term of four years.

> (c)     The Prosecution also highlighted various aggravating factors but stopped short of contending that these justified a further uplift beyond the four-year custodial term derived under the second step above.

The Defence did not dispute the steps in the Prosecution’s reasoning above.

32     I now explore each of these three steps in turn.

#### Step 1 – The notional starting sentence had this been a case of voluntarily causing grievous hurt simpliciter

33     In _Ng Soon Kim_, the offender had sprayed insecticide at the victim’s face, while simultaneously igniting the aerosol stream with a lighter, as the victim sat in his car. The victim’s hair was singed and he suffered some superficial first degree burns. Menon CJ approached the sentencing process by first determining the notional starting sentence had the case been one of causing hurt _simpliciter_. His Honour did this by applying the sentencing framework in _Low Song Chye v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 140</span> (“_Low Song Chye_”). _Low Song Chye_ had laid out indicative starting sentences for offences under s 323 of the Penal Code, by way of sentencing bands gradated according to the seriousness of the injury (see _Low Song Chye_ at \[77\]). Having regard to these bands, Menon CJ opined that had the case been one of causing hurt _simpliciter_, the notional starting sentence, in light of the injuries in _Ng Soon Kim_, would have been a short imprisonment term of two months.

34     Reverting to the present case, the first step of the three-step process (as adapted from _Ng Soon Kim_) requires me to determine the notional starting sentence had the offence been one of voluntarily causing **grievous hurt** _simpliciter_. In that respect, the relevant sentencing precedent would be _Public Prosecutor v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 127</span> (“_BDB_”). In that case, the Court of Appeal (as with _Low Song Chye_) held that the sentence would hinge on the seriousness of the injury caused (at \[56\]):

> … the factor that should guide the court’s determination of the indicative starting point for sentencing should be the seriousness of the hurt caused to the victim. As we have already noted, s 325 encompasses a broad spectrum of different forms of grievous hurt ranging from a simple fracture to death.

35     In _BDB_, the offender had inflicted injuries on her infant son that ultimately led to his demise. Of relevance was the sixth charge, wherein the offender had caused fractures to the victim’s ribs, calf and elbow. For this, the Court of Appeal suggested an indicative starting sentence of three years and six months’ imprisonment (at \[56\]):

> We do not propose to set out a range of indicative starting points for each type of grievous hurt, but what is relevant for present purposes is that in a case where the grievous hurt takes the form of death (as in the case of the first charge against the Respondent), the indicative starting point should be a term of imprisonment of around eight years, which is close to the maximum imprisonment term of ten years; whereas **_in a case where the grievous hurt takes the form of multiple fractures of the type and gravity described in the sixth charge against the Respondent, the indicative starting point should be a term of imprisonment of around three years and six months_**. \[emphasis added\]

The injuries enumerated within the sixth charge in _BDB_ were of somewhat comparable severity to that in the present case, where the victim similarly suffered fractured ribs. While the victim in the present case did not suffer as many fractures as the victim in _BDB_, this was counterbalanced by the fact that the victim in the present case also suffered a stab wound to the chest.

36     I thus agreed with the Prosecution that the appropriate starting custodial term under the first step of the _Ng Soon Kim_ process would, given the nature of the injuries in the present case, be three years and six months.

37     As regards the caning component, I noted that the Court of Appeal in _BDB_ remarked that “_where non-fatal serious injury is caused, a sentence of between six and 12 strokes of the cane may be considered_” (at \[76\]). The Prosecution’s submission of six strokes of the cane is in line with that.

#### Step 2 – The appropriate uplift to account for the weapon used

38     For voluntarily causing **hurt** with a dangerous weapon under s 324 of the Penal Code, the notional starting sentence derived under the first step of the _Ng Soon Kim_ process could potentially extend to two years’ imprisonment. This is because:

> (a)     the notional starting sentence is derived by postulating what the indicative starting sentence would have been had the case been one of causing **hurt** _simpliciter_ under s 323 of the Penal Code; and

> (b)     that notional starting sentence must necessarily be limited by the maximum imprisonment term under s 323, which is two years.

This means that for an offence under s 324 of the Penal Code, the maximum custodial uplift under the second step of the _Ng Soon Kim_ process (to account for the dangerous weapon or means used) is five years’ imprisonment. This is because if the notional starting sentence under the first step is pegged at the maximum of two years’ imprisonment, the highest custodial uplift that could be added under the second step is five years, as that would bring the total imprisonment term to s 324’s upper limit of seven years.

39     Transposing the above breakdown to the s 326 context, _ie_, voluntarily causing **grievous hurt** with a dangerous weapon, the notional starting sentence derived under the first step of the _Ng Soon Kim_ process could potentially extend to 10 years’ imprisonment. As per the reasoning above:

> (a)     the notional starting sentence is derived by postulating what the indicative starting sentence would have been had the case been one of causing **grievous hurt** _simpliciter_ under s 325 of the Penal Code; and

> (b)     that notional starting sentence must necessarily be limited by the maximum imprisonment term under s 325, which is 10 years.

This means that for an offence under s 326 of the Penal Code, the maximum custodial uplift under the second step of the _Ng Soon Kim_ process (to account for the dangerous weapon or means used) is five years’ imprisonment. This is because if the notional starting sentence under the first step is pegged at the maximum of 10 years’ imprisonment, the highest custodial uplift that could be added under the second step is five years, as that would bring the total imprisonment term to s 326’s upper limit of 15 years.

40     The above analysis focuses only on the custodial aspect of the sentence and not on the caning component (which can also form part of the sentence under ss 324 and 326 of the Penal Code). Still, it is interesting to note that if the above analysis is correct, the maximum custodial uplift under the second step of the _Ng Soon Kim_ process (to account for the dangerous weapon or means used) is the same for both s 324 and s 326, _ie_, five years. Reverting to the present case, the question is thus how much of an uplift, within that five-year spread, would the multi-purpose knife used in this case attract?

41     In determining the uplift under the second step of the _Ng Soon Kim_ process, one needs to look at how _inherently_ egregious the weapon or means employed was. The greater its potential harm, the greater the uplift. As Menon CJ observed in _Ng Soon Kim_ (at \[11\]):

> Some of these means, such as using an instrument for shooting, or using a weapon likely to cause death, are likely to be **_inherently more egregious_** than other means, such as the use of a substance deleterious to the body or by means of an animal, although even in the latter, **_much will depend on the particular facts_**. By way of example, if the accused person were to use an animal to inflict harm, the gravity and egregiousness would vary greatly depending on whether, for instance, a king cobra was used as compared to if a small dog was used. \[emphasis added\]

In _Ng Soon Kim_, Menon CJ observed that the act of spraying insecticide at the victim while igniting the aerosol stream “would not have been trivial by any means, but neither would it have been at the high end of serious culpability” (at \[15\]). Menon CJ also took account of the enhanced potential harm arising from the flame being directed into the confines of the victim’s car −the car’s interior could have caught fire. That risk was further compounded by the fact that the car was in the middle of a busy road intersection. Menon CJ thus held that under the second step of the sentencing process, an uplift of six months’ imprisonment was warranted on account of the dangerous means used to inflict the hurt. Adding this six-month uplift to the two-month term derived under the first step, Menon CJ held that an appropriate sentence (prior to adjustment for mitigating/aggravating factors) would have been eight month’s imprisonment: see _Ng Soon Kim_ at \[17\].

42     It is noteworthy that when assessing the potential harm from the ignited aerosol stream, Menon CJ also took account of how that harm was exacerbated by the interplay with _environmental factors_, e.g. the possibility of fire starting in the victim’s car at a busy road intersection. In contrast, the _inherent_ danger of a knife is, in my view, necessarily higher. As an instrument for cutting or stabbing, it could potentially kill with a single blow to any one of the human body’s vulnerable points, _irrespective_ of interplay with environmental factors. As such, if an ignited aerosol stream could attract an uplift of six months’ imprisonment under the second step of the _Ng Soon Kim_ process, the uplift for the Accused’s multi-purpose knife should (in the ordinary course of things) be pegged at no less than that.

43     I thus concurred with the Prosecution that under the second step of the _Ng Soon Kim_ process, an uplift of six months’ imprisonment should be added in this case. In fact, six months might possibly be regarded as being on the low side. The Court of Appeal has held that sentencing courts should utilise the full spectrum of possible sentences: see _Suventher Shanmugam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 115</span> (“_Suventher Shanmugam_”) at \[26\]. By the same spirit, the uplift under the second step of the _Ng Soon Kim_ process should similarly utilise the full spectrum of the five-year spread (referred to at paragraph 40 above). Against that backdrop, an uplift of six months seemed rather low, when juxtaposed against the inherently dangerous nature of a knife. Nevertheless, in the absence of full submissions on this point, I did not pursue it.

#### Step 3 – Calibrating for aggravating and mitigating factors

44     The third step under the _Ng Soon Kim_ process entails adjusting the overall sentence to account for aggravating and mitigating circumstances.

45     The Defence sought to raise various mitigating factors:

> (a)     Firstly, the Accused was suffering from depression.

> (b)     Secondly, the Accused had legitimate reasons for bringing his weapons to the meeting with the victim. He brought along the _parang_ as he wanted to protect himself from the victim, while the multi-purpose knife and Swiss knife were in his possession as he used them for work (cutting box straps at the airport cargo complex). It was not as if he brought these items with the intention of injuring the Accused. As such, the offences were not premeditated.

> (c)     Thirdly, the Accused was on crutches at the point of the scuffle and it was the victim who first rushed up to attack the Accused while the latter was about to alight from the Grab vehicle.

Apart from the above, I also noted an additional mitigating factor, which was that the Accused pleaded guilty.

46     As regards the first mitigating point, _ie_, that the Accused suffered from depression, I placed no weight on this. A mental condition carries little or no mitigating value if it has no contributory link to the commission of the offence: see _Ye Lin Myint v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 221</span> (“_Ye Lin Myint_”) at \[82\]. In this respect, I noted that the IMH Report stated quite unequivocally:[^12]

> Though \[the Accused\] has a mental condition, i.e. Major Depressive Disorder and is receiving treatment for it, he was not depressed at the time of the offences. His mental condition thus has no bearing on his _mens rea_ in committing the alleged offences.

47     As regards the second mitigating point, _ie_, that the Accused had brought his weapons along to the meeting with the victim without any premediated intent to hurt the victim, I failed to see how this was a ‘mitigating’ factor. Rather, the converse was true −premeditation would have been an aggravating factor. Furthermore, I was unconvinced by the Defence’s explanations on this point, which were unsatisfactory in material respects:

> (a)     As regards the multi-purpose knife and Swiss knife, the reasons furnished by the Defence to the court for why the Accused carried these two items were inconsistent with what he told the psychiatrist. In mitigation, the Defence told the court that the Accused carried these two knives for work, as he needed to cut box straps at the airport cargo complex. However, the IMH Report stated:[^13]

>> He also mentioned that he had **_developed a hobby of collecting knives_** in the past 2 years, and that these were Swiss army knives **_he either bought from shops or got from his mother, who worked in airport customs and had access to passengers’ contraband items_**. He gave inconsistent information regarding the number of knives he had collected so far; estimating them to be around 3-4 in total and that his father had thrown away some. … ". He denied ever hurting anyone with the knives before and maintained that they were for his collection. However. he also mentioned **_carrying a flick knife with him at all times in his pouch bag for ‘protection’_**, after being the victim of a failed robbery attempt. \[emphasis added\]

> The explanations offered by the Defence for why the Accused brought the multi-purpose knife and Swiss knife thus did not withstand scrutiny.

> (b)     As regards the _parang_, the factual matrix offered no suggestion for why the Accused needed something that deadly to “protect” himself from the victim. According to the IMH Report,[^14] the Accused previously defended himself against the victim’s beatings by using a book or pillow. It was unclear why the means of protection now had to be stepped up to a _parang_. All the more so when the Accused was already carrying the multi-purpose knife and Swiss knife (ostensibly for work).

The Defence thus failed to satisfy me that the Accused’s motivations for carrying the weapons to his meeting with the victim were innocent.

48     As regards the third mitigating point, _ie_, that the Accused was on crutches and it was the victim who rushed up to attack him, this was disputed by the Prosecution.[^15] Having regard to the surrounding circumstances, I placed little weight on the Accused’s account in this regard, for the following reasons:

> (a)     Firstly, it ran counter to the Statement of Facts (to which the Accused had admitted without qualification), which stated that the Accused alighted from the Grab vehicle and _jumped towards_ the victim. That was at odds with the Defence’s depiction of a person on crutches.

> (b)     Furthermore, the Defence had sought to explain the Accused’s possession of the multi-purpose knife and Swiss knife by saying that he carried these for his work at the airport cargo complex. This then begged the question of how the Accused could engage in work involving tasks of a physical nature (cutting box straps) when he was supposed to be on crutches at that point. When confronted with this query during the hearing, the Defence explained that the Accused was working on an “odd job basis” and not continuously.[^16] Still, this had to be viewed against the IMH Report, which contained a detailed account (seven paragraphs[^17]) of the events leading up to and during the alleged attack by the victim when the Accused was alighting from the Grab vehicle −that contained no mention whatsoever of the Accused being on crutches.

As such, the Defence’s portrayal of the Accused as a vulnerable and disabled person beset upon by the victim did not cohere with the extrinsic facts.

49     In any case, even if I accept the Defence’s account that it was the victim who attacked first, this had to be counterbalanced against the following factors:

> (a)     the victim was unarmed; and

> (b)     the Accused stabbed him in a highly vulnerable part of the body (his chest).

The Accused’s actions were thus grossly disproportionate.

50     Finally, I note that the purported mitigating factors, coupled with the Accused’s plea of guilt, were counterbalanced by the fact that the Accused committed the present offences while on bail. This was an aggravating factor: see _Public Prosecutor v Loqmanul Hakim bin Buang_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGHC 159</span> at \[54\]. I pause to observe that this was not simply a case where the Accused was on bail pending determination by the Prosecution as to what charges to prefer. He had been _convicted_ for the MDA Charges and was awaiting a sentence that he must have known (given the LT1 Charge) would have exceeded five years. Yet, just seven days into his release on bail, he committed the present offences.

51     Consequently, I was of the view that a downward adjustment of the four-year custodial duration, as derived under the second step of the _Ng Soon Kim_ process, was not warranted. As for the Prosecution’s submission seeking six strokes of the cane, this was in line with the precedents for similar cases and, in any event, not challenged by the Defence. The appropriate sentence for the Section 326 Charge would therefore be **four years’** imprisonment with six strokes of the cane.

### Appropriate Sentence for the CESOWA Charge

52     The sentence sought by the Prosecution for the CESOWA Charge, _ie_, eight months’ imprisonment with six strokes of the cane, was also in line with the precedents and, as with the sentence sought by the Prosecution for the Section 326 Charge, not challenged by the Defence.

### Commencement Date of the Imprisonment Term

53     I was of the view that the imprisonment terms for the Section 326 Charge and CESOWA Charge should run concurrently, as the offences underlying both effectively arose from the same transaction. The appropriate global sentence for both charges was thus **four years’ imprisonment with 12 strokes of the cane**. The next issue was _when_ this sentence should be ordered to commence.

54     When the Accused appeared before me for sentencing, he was serving an imprisonment term of five years and three months for the MDA Charges. As that term had commence as from 12 July 2018, the earliest date of his release would have been 42 months (_ie_, two-thirds of five years and three months) from 12 July 2018, _ie_, around 11 January 2022.

55     Section 322(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) states:

> Where a person who … is undergoing a sentence of imprisonment is sentenced again to imprisonment, the latter sentence of imprisonment must begin either immediately or at the end of the imprisonment to which he was previously sentenced, as the court awarding the sentence directs.

56     As such, the sentence for the two charges before me could commence at either of two points in time:

> (a)     Immediately, from date of sentencing on 24 February 2020.

> (b)     Upon expiry of the imprisonment term for the MDA Charges.

Option (a) would effectively result in the four-year custodial term imposed by me being discounted by about 22½ months, this being the length of the window between 24 February 2020 and 11 January 2022 (_ie_, the earliest date of release for the MDA Charges), during which the Accused would in any case have been in prison for the MDA Charges. In contrast, option (b) would result in the full four-year custodial term being visited upon the Accused. Unsurprisingly, the Defence argued for option (a), while the Prosecution argued for option (b).

57     The operation of s 322(1) of the CPC was examined by the High Court in _Public Prosecutor v Hang Tuah bin Jumaat_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 2 SLR 527</span> (“_Hang Tuah bin Jumaat_”). In that case, the offender was serving a 12-year imprisonment term when he was sentenced again for further charges. For these further charges, the lower court imposed a custodial term of four years and 11 months, which was ordered to commence immediately (rather than on expiry of the 12-year term). The result was that the custodial term for the further charges became subsumed within the 12-year term that the offender was already serving (see _Hang Tuah bin Jumaat_ at \[17\]). On appeal by the Prosecution, Chao JA (as his Honour then was) reversed the lower court and ordered the custodial term for the further charges to commence on expiry of the 12-year term. Chao JA observed that if the further charges arose under a _different transaction_ from that underlying the earlier charges for which the offender was currently in prison, this would weigh in favour of ordering the sentence for the further charges to commence only on expiry of the prison term currently being served (at \[27\]):

> … in deciding whether to order a subsequent term of imprisonment to run immediately or at the expiration of the earlier term of imprisonment, the court should have regard to whether the subsequent offence(s) arose in the “same transaction” as the earlier offence(s), and also the totality of the sentence to be served … . Conversely, **the fact that the subsequent offence(s) arose in different transactions is a weighty consideration that warrants the imposition of an order that the subsequent term of imprisonment should start at the expiration of the earlier term of imprisonment**. \[emphasis added\]

58     In line with this observation, I was of the view that the sentence to be imposed for the two charges before me (_ie_, the Section 326 Charge and the CESOWA Charge) should commence only upon expiry of the imprisonment term which the Accused was currently serving for the MDA Charges. Clearly, the transaction underlying the two charges were very different from that underlying the MDA Charges −the former related to offences that the Accused went on to commit after he had already been convicted for the latter.

59     Nevertheless, I was mindful of the caution sounded by Chao JA in _Hang Tuah bin Jumaat_ (at \[33\]) that the effective sentence must still be proportionate to the gravity of the offender’s overall criminality:

> … the court ultimately has a primary duty to determine the appropriate sentence which would best ensure that the ends of justice are met. ... One factor that the court should consider is whether the totality of the sentence served is proportionate to the inherent gravity of all the offences committed by the accused. Hence, while the individual sentence for a particular offence may be perfectly appropriate, the cumulative effect of the sentences may well result in a total term of imprisonment that is disproportionate to the overall criminality of the accused … .

In _Hang Tuah bin Jumaat_, although Chao JA ordered the sentence imposed for the further charges to commence only on expiry of the 12-year imprisonment term that the offender was currently serving, his Honour was of the view that it would be excessive to append the _full_ four years and 11 months (imposed for the further charges) to the 12-year term. In particular, Chao JA noted that the further charges were originally meant to have been _taken into consideration_ at the earlier hearing where the 12-year term was imposed. The offender had refused to consent to this, with the result that the further charges ultimately had to be dealt with at a later hearing (at which the custodial term of four years and 11 months was imposed). Chao JA remarked that if the further charges had indeed been merely taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing, the earlier court imposing the 12-year term “_would probably have just marginally enhanced the aggregate sentence imposed on the Respondent_” on account of the further charges: see _Hang Tuah bin Jumaat_ (at \[47\]). Chao JA thus reduced the custodial term imposed for the further charges, from four years and 11 months to just two years, before ordering it to commence on expiry of the 12-year term.

60     Still on the issue of proportionality, Chao JA opined that the judge sentencing an offender who is currently serving an imprisonment term for prior offences should conduct a proportionality check, by posing the following question to himself (_Hang Tuah bin Jumaat_ (at \[34\]):

> … if all the offences had been before \[the judge\], would he still have passed a sentence of similar length? If not, the judge should adjust the sentence imposed for the latest offence in light of the aggregate sentence … .

Adopting the above paradigm, I now ask myself: what would have been the likely aggregate sentence in the notional scenario where the two charges before me (_ie_, the Section 326 Charge and the CESOWA Charge) had been dealt with together with the MDA Charges, at a single consolidated hearing?

61     In answering that question, I proceeded on the premise that in the notional consolidated hearing, I would impose the same individual sentences for the MDA Charges as that imposed by the judge on 7 May 2019. Laying those sentences alongside the sentences that I have proposed for the Section 326 Charge and CESOWA Charge, we get the following array of sentences:

62     Had all five of the above charges been before me for sentencing, I would have ordered the sentences for the LT1 Charge and the Section 326 Charge to run consecutively (with the others to run concurrently), giving rise to an aggregate custodial duration of **nine years**. The consecutive running of the LT1 Charge and Section 326 Charge was entirely proper, given that they pertained to infringements of distinct legally protected interests: see _Public Prosecutor v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 148</span> (“_Raveen Balakrishnan_”) at \[41\]-\[46\] & 48. Furthermore, it is clear from the table above that these are the two most serious charges at play. Given their gravity, I was of the view that both these charges must play an operative role in the aggregate sentence, to properly reflect the Accused’s overall criminality. As Sundaresh Menon CJ held in _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 34</span> (at \[81(e)\]):

> … the consideration of which sentences should run consecutively is likely to be a multi-factorial consideration in which the court assesses what would be a proportionate and adequate aggregate sentence having regard to the totality of the criminal behaviour of the accused person

I also saw no reason to adjust the aggregate custodial duration downwards, as was done in _Hang Tuah bin Jumaat_. In that case, the further charges would have merely been taken into consideration had they been collectively dealt with at the earlier sentencing hearing. Reverting to the present case, there was no indication that either the LT1 Charge or Section 326 Charge were ever going to merely be taken into consideration.

63     Having arrived at an aggregate custodial duration of nine years, I tested this against the totality principle, to ensure that it was not excessive. In _Raveen Balkrishnan_, Sundaresh Menon CJ explained (at \[73\]) that the totality principle comprises two limbs:

> Specifically, the principle has two limbs: first, to examine whether the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed, and second, to examine whether the effect of the aggregate sentence on the offender is crushing and not in keeping with his past record and future prospects … . If an aggregate sentence is considered excessive, the sentencing judge may opt for a different combination of sentences to run consecutively or adjust the individual sentences … .

Following from the above, I considered how each limb of the totality principle applied to the present facts.

64     The first limb of the totality principle examines whether the aggregate sentence is substantially above the “_normal level of sentences_” for the most serious of the individual offences committed. In applying the first limb, I considered the following:

> (a)     The most serious of the individual offences at play here would be s 326 of the Penal Code, which prescribes a maximum custodial term of 15 years (_ie_, higher than that of the other offences here). The question would therefore be whether the aggregate nine-year custodial duration (proposed at paragraph 62 above) was substantially above the “normal level of sentences” imposed under s 326 of the Penal Code.

> (b)     The challenge here was to determine what constitutes the “normal level of sentences”, given that the range of sentences which s 326 of the Penal Code attracts hinges on a myriad of factors (including the severity of the injury caused to the victim, the inherent danger of the weapon used, generic offender-specific factors, _etc_). In fact, the term “normal level”, which was used by Professor D A Thomas in _Principles of Sentencing_ (Heinemann, 2nd Ed, 1979) (at pp 57-58), could potentially be taken to mean various things (_eg_, mean, median or mode).

> (c)     Ultimately, I decided to take the midpoint of the full span of possible custodial terms under s 326 of the Penal Code, as a proxy for what might be considered the “normal level” of custodial terms for this offence. The use of the midpoint as a proxy for the “normal level” was accepted in _Ye Lin Myint_ (at \[94\]), where the court was faced with a dearth of sentencing precedents for the offence in question. Respectfully, I was of the view that the midpoint is a sound proxy, especially if “normal level” is likened more towards the median. If sentencing courts utilise the full spectrum of possible sentences (as they should: see _Suventher Shanmugam_ at \[26\]), it is not unreasonable to postulate that the “normal level” of custodial terms imposed for an offence should not deviate far from the midpoint of the spectrum.

> (d)     Reverting to the present case, given that the maximum custodial duration under s 326 of the Penal Code is 15 years, the midpoint is 7½ years. That is not very far from nine years.

Consequently, the aggregate nine-year custodial duration proposed at paragraph 62 above did not breach the first limb of the totality principle.

65     The second limb of the totality principle examines whether the aggregate sentence is crushing. I did not think that the aggregate nine-year custodial duration proposed at paragraph 62 above could be described as such. Assuming that the Accused gets two-thirds’ remission off his imprisonment term, he could be out of prison by July 2024.[^18] As the Accused is only 26 years old now, he would still have the prime of his life ahead of him.

## Conclusion

66     Given that there were three MDA Charges, the operation of s 307(1) of the CPC meant that the judge who sentenced the Accused (on 7 May 2019) had to order that the sentences for two of these three charges run consecutively. To that end, the three-month term for the charge under s 9 of the MDA was made to run consecutively with the five-year term for the LT1 Charge. The global imprisonment term for the MDA Charges was thus five years and three months. For me to generate an aggregate custodial duration of nine years that subsumes the imprisonment term for the MDA Charges, I had to shave three months off the four-year custodial term proposed for the Section 326 Charge (at paragraph 51 above). This would give rise to a global custodial term of **three years and nine months** for the two charges before me which, if ordered to commence on expiry of the five years and three months being served for the MDA Charges, adds up to an aggregate custodial duration of nine years (for all charges).

67     In summary, I imposed the following sentences:

> (a)     Three years and nine months’ imprisonment with six strokes of the cane for the Section 326 Charge; and

> (b)     Eight months’ imprisonment with six strokes of the cane for the CESOWA charge.

Both were ordered to run concurrently, giving rise to a global imprisonment term of three years and nine months’ imprisonment with 12 strokes of the cane.

68     I also ordered the above sentence to commence upon expiry of the imprisonment term of five years and three months currently being served for the MDA Charges. That meant that the aggregate custodial duration that the Accused would serve, for both the MDA Charges and the two charges for which I have just sentenced him, added up to nine years (commencing from 12 July 2018). As explained above, this aggregate custodial duration reflected the overall criminality of the Accused and also abided by the totality principle.
