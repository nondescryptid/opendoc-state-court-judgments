### District Judge Shawn Ho:

## INTRODUCTION

1       At its heart, the analytical framework of harm, culpability, aggravating and mitigating factors lends itself well to sentencing.

2       For the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt under s 325 of the Penal Code, harm is the pillar on which we place the cross-beams of culpability, aggravating factors, and mitigating factors.[^1] Facts are the cornerstone of a case. The highly fact-specific nature of such offences means that the highest level of attention must be afforded to the facts and circumstances of each case.

3       In the present case, each Accused pleaded guilty to one count of s 325 read with s 34 of the Penal Code. They were intoxicated and voluntarily caused grievous hurt to the victim, Dutta Litton, by kicking his left elbow and punching him multiple times, causing him to suffer a dislocation of the left elbow. The victim was given hospitalisation leave for 14 days. The attack was unprovoked.

4       All things considered, each Accused was sentenced to 8 months’ imprisonment. The Statement of Facts can be found at _Annex A_.

5       No appeal has been lodged. I now set out my reasons.

## ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK

6       The interplay of harm,[^2] culpability,[^3] aggravating and mitigating factors (“Analytical Framework”) lends itself well to sentencing.

7       The Analytical Framework for offences under s 325 of the Penal Code may be curated as follows:[^4]

![]([2019] SGDC 0210_Image/[2019] SGDC 0210_image1.png)

8       Two observations can be made in relation to the Analytical Framework:

> (a)     The synergistic interplay between harm, culpability, aggravating and mitigating factors enhances sentencing.

> (b)     The eclectic ensemble of cases adopting the Analytical Framework is testament to its versatility.

9       First, the synergistic interplay of harm, culpability, aggravating and mitigating factors enhances sentencing.

10     The typical framework consists of a 2-step sentencing bands framework as found in _Ng Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 37</span> at \[73(a), (c) and (d)\].[^5]

11     At the first step, the court should have regard to the _offence-specific_ factors in deciding which band the offence in question falls under. Offence-specific factors comprise factors going towards: (a) the harm caused by the offence; and (b) the offender’s culpability.[^6]

12     These categories may not always be watertight.[^7] For instance, the degree of planning and premeditation and the level of sophistication, were categorised as offence-specific factors going towards the offender’s _culpability_ in _Logachev Vladislav_. Yet, the High Court observed that they may also relate to the _harm_ caused by the offence in so far as they affect the likelihood of harm: _Logachev Vladislav v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 12</span> at \[38\]. The court should also evaluate the appropriate amount of weight to be given to each offence-specific factor: _Lim Teck Kim v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 99</span> at \[26\]-\[27\].[^8]

13     Once the sentencing band, which defines the range of sentences which may usually be imposed for an offence with those features, is identified, the court has to go on to identify precisely where within that range the present offence falls in order to derive an “indicative starting point”.

14     At the second step, the court should have regard to the aggravating and mitigating factors which are personal to the offender to calibrate the sentence. These _offender-specific_ factors comprise other aggravating and mitigating factors which do not directly relate to the commission of the offence.[^9] Sentencing is ultimately an exercise in evaluative ethical judgment; there might well be cases which will eventually be assessed to straddle the border between the bands: _Ng Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 37</span> at \[48\].[^10]

15     I pause here to note that a variant of the 2-step sentencing bands framework finds expression in drug trafficking and importation cases where the quantity of the drugs indicates the potential harm to society.[^11]  In this regard, the indicative starting sentence – based on the quantity of the drugs (_viz._ potential harm) – may be adjusted upward or downward to take into account the offenders’ culpability and the presence of aggravating or mitigating factors.  Essentially, _harm_ is the fulcrum for such cases.

16     In similar vein, for voluntarily causing grievous hurt under s 325 of the Penal Code, the seriousness of the injury caused (_viz._ harm) is a primary indicator of the gravity of the offence and can guide the court in determining the indicative starting point for sentencing. The indicative starting sentence may then be adjusted upward or downward based on the offenders’ culpability and other aggravating and mitigating factors: _Public Prosecutor v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 69</span> at \[42\] and \[55\].[^12]

17     Another model of the 2-step sentencing bands framework can be found in fatal accident cases under s 304A(a) of the Penal Code. For such cases, as the harm is the death of the victim, the harm is generally uniform. Accordingly, what sets such cases apart is, in the vast majority of cases, determined primarily by the accused’s _culpability_.[^13]  After considering the accused’s culpability, a sentencing court takes into account other aggravating and mitigating factors: _Public Prosecutor v Ganesan Sivasankar_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 176</span> at \[54\].[^14]

18     Finally, in _Public Prosecutor v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 306</span> at \[52\], \[57\] and \[60\],[^15] the 3-Judge Panel noted that the:

> “offence-specific and offender-specific aggravating and mitigating factors are necessarily factored into the analysis within the harm and culpability considerations themselves”.

19     An example of this approach may be found in _Public Prosecutor v Sakthikanesh s/o Chidambaram & Ors_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 178</span> at \[50\]-\[56\], where the 3-Judge Panel held that exceptional performance during National Service was not a mitigating factor, as it reduces neither the defaulter’s _culpability_ nor the _harm_ he had caused by his offence.

20     In sum, the above discussion can be condensed as follows:

22     I am mindful that in assessing the level of harm or potential harm, the sentencing court should be careful not to double-count any factors which may already have been taken into account in assessing the level of culpability: _Neo Ah Luan v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 188</span> at \[70\].[^27]

(See also Andrew Ashworth, _Sentencing and Criminal Justice_ (6th Edition, 2015, Cambridge University Press) at \[4.3\] and \[4.5\])

## APPROPRIATE SENTENCE

23      **Prescribed Punishment** **.** The prescribed punishment for voluntarily causing grievous hurt[^28] under s 325 of the Penal Code is imprisonment for up to 10 years, fine or caning.

24     The offence’s statutory maximum sentence signals the gravity in which Parliament views such offences. A sentencing judge ought therefore to take this into account when determining precisely where the offender’s conduct falls within the entire range of punishment devised by Parliament.[^29]

25      **Sentencing Guidelines** **.** The Court of Appeal, in _Public Prosecutor v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 69</span> at \[55\] laid down a two-step process for s 325 of the Penal Code:

> (a)     The seriousness of the injury caused is a good indicator of the gravity of the offence and can guide the court in determining the indicative starting point for sentencing.

> (b)     The indicative starting sentence may then be adjusted upward or downward based on the offenders’ culpability and other aggravating and mitigating factors.

26      **Submissions on Sentence** **.** The Prosecution sought a sentence of 9 months’ imprisonment for each Accused and a compensation order of $440.90.

27     The Defence asked for not more than 7 months’ imprisonment for each Accused with no compensation order.[^30]

## Harm

28     The victim suffered a dislocation of the left elbow joint with effusion and facial lacerations.[^31]

29     The Prosecution cited two precedents: _Public Prosecutor v Ong Choon Beng Francis_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 59</span>[^32] and _Public Prosecutor v Samson Tanuwidjaja_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 228</span>.[^33] In both cases, the victims’ injuries were more serious vis-à-vis the present victim.

30     In _Ong Choon Beng Francis_, the victim suffered multiple areas of haemorrhage in the brain and an undisplaced fracture of the left occipital bone, with cognitive impairment secondary to traumatic brain injury – the victim’s injuries were described as “life-threatening”.[^34] In _Samson Tanuwidjaja_, the victim suffered a head injury and nasal bone fracture.[^35]

31     In the present case, the victim was given 14 days of hospitalisation leave for his dislocated left elbow and facial lacerations.[^36] Based on the seriousness of his injuries, the indicative starting point for sentencing is 6-7 months’ imprisonment. This indicative starting sentence was then adjusted upward to 8 months’ imprisonment (as analysed below at \[33\]-\[40\]) to take into account the Accused Persons’ culpability and other aggravating and mitigating factors: _Public Prosecutor v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 69</span> at \[55\]. 

32     By way of comparison, the indicative starting point for sentencing was 6 months’ imprisonment for a fractured middle finger in _Arumugam Selvaraj v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 199</span> at \[13\]. In that case, the victim was given 5 days of medical leave.[^37] Ultimately, the High Court in _Arumugam Selvaraj_ adjusted the indicative starting sentence upward to 7 months’ imprisonment.[^38]

## Culpability & Mitigating/ Aggravating Factors

33      **Culpability**. I agree with the Prosecution that this was an unprovoked attack by two Accused Persons on the victim.[^39]

34     The attack – consisting of punches and a kick – continued even after the victim had fallen onto the ground.[^40] This is similar to _Ong Choon Beng Francis_[^41] and _Samson Tanuwidjaja_,[^42] where the accused persons continued assaulting the victims even after they had fallen onto the ground.

35     That said, I agree with the Defence that _Samson Tanuwidjaja_ can be distinguished as the accused person stalked the victim before attacking her, and he had claimed trial.[^43]

36      **Plea of Guilt**. I gave due weight to the Accused Persons’ plea of guilt.[^44]

37      **No Prior Antecedents** **.** I considered the fact that both Accused Persons have no prior antecedents.

38      **Personal Circumstances** **.** The Accused Persons said that being the sole bread-winners, their incarceration would bring hardship to their family.[^45]

39     However, personal circumstances such as financial difficulties and hardship caused to family by their incarceration have no mitigating value save in the most exceptional cases.[^46] In the present case, I saw no cogent reasons to consider their personal financial and family circumstances as valid mitigating factors.[^47]

40      **Intoxication as an Aggravating Factor**. The fact that the Accused Persons were intoxicated is an aggravating factor, as no intoxicated person should be given the licence to behave in a disorderly and loutish manner: _Wong Hoi Len v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 1 SLR(R) 115</span> at \[44\].[^48]

41      **Sentence** **.** All things considered, I sentenced each Accused to 8 months’ imprisonment.[^49]

42      **Parity Principle** **.** I am aware that the parity principle in sentencing between co-offenders urges that sentences meted out to co-offenders who are party to a common criminal enterprise should not be unduly disparate from each other. Put simply, those of similar culpability should receive similar sentences, while those of greater culpability should generally be more severely punished.[^50]

43     What is crucial in applying the parity principle is not whether the accused feels aggrieved that a co-accused person has been treated more leniently, but whether the public, with knowledge of the various sentences, would perceive that the appellant had suffered injustice. The parity principle rests on the need to preserve and protect public confidence in the administration of justice.[^51]

44     The parity principle is not to be applied in a rigid and inflexible manner. Rather, it is an important aid to the sentencing court to ensure that sentencing of co-offenders is done in a manner that is broadly consistent and fair. But ultimately, what is consistent and fair depends on the facts of the case.[^52] In the present case, I am of the view that both Accused Persons deserve the same sentence.

45     I also kept in mind the proportionality principle in sentencing.[^53]

46      **Compensation Order**. A compensation order can be made under s 359(1) and (2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed). Since a compensation order is not punishment, it should not be oppressive to the offender.[^54]

47     In the present case, I accepted the Defence’s submission that both Accused Persons – being on the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme, having been remanded for several months, and who would be repatriated after their release from prison – would be unable to pay compensation to the victim. Accordingly, I did not make any compensation order.[^55]

## CONCLUSION

## Summary

48     A summary of my Grounds of Decision is as follows:

> (a)      **Harm**. The victim was given 14 days of hospitalisation leave for his dislocated left elbow and facial lacerations. Based on the seriousness of his injuries, the indicative starting point for sentencing is 6-7 months’ imprisonment. This indicative starting sentence was then adjusted upward to 8 months’ imprisonment to take into account the Accused Persons’ culpability and other aggravating and mitigating factors (at \[28\]-\[32\]).

> (b)      **Culpability**. This was an unprovoked attack by two Accused Persons on the victim. The attack – consisting of punches and a kick – continued even after the victim had fallen onto the ground (at \[33\]-\[35\]).

> (c)      **Mitigating Factors**. I gave due weight to the Accused Persons’ plea of guilt and their lack of prior antecedents. There were no cogent reasons to consider their personal financial and family circumstances as valid mitigating factors (at \[36\]-\[39\]).

> (d)      **Aggravating Factors**. The fact that the Accused Persons were intoxicated is an aggravating factor (at \[40\]).

> (e)      **Principles of Parity and Proportionality**. I kept in mind the principles of parity and proportionality in sentencing (at \[42\]-\[45\]).

> (f)      **Compensation Order**. No compensation order was made (at \[46\]-\[47\]).

49     Each Accused was sentenced to 8 months’ imprisonment.[^56] They are currently serving their sentence. No appeal has been lodged.

50     In closing, I am grateful for the hard work and submissions of both sides.

**Annex A: Statement of Facts**

**PUBLIC PROSECUTOR v NATARAJAN BASKARAN (DAC-912419-2019) & VENKATACHALAM THIRUMURUGAN (DAC-912420-2019)**

**JOINT STATEMENT OF FACTS**

**_(incorporating one proceeded charge against each accused person listed above)_**

A.      **Introduction**

1.     The accused is Natarajan Baskaran (“**Natarajan**”), a 35-year-old male Indian national. At the material time of his offence, he was working as a piping maintenance officer at Tham Engineering Pte Ltd.

2.     The second accused is Venkatachalam Thirumurugan (“**Venkatachalam**”), a 27-year-old male Indian national. At the material time of his offence, he was working as a piping maintenance officer at Tham Engineering Pte Ltd.

B.      **First Information Report**

3.     The complainant is Tan Choon Yong Harris, a 39-year-old male.

4.     On 21 April 2019 at 3.24pm, the complainant called 999 stating “_Three persons fighting need ambulance_”. The incident location was given as West Coast Park Singapore, BBQ Pit 5.

C.      **Facts relating to the charges (DAC-912419-2019 & DAC-912420-2019)**

5.     The victim is Dutta Litton, a 35-year-old male Bangladeshi. At the material time, he was working as a piping maintenance officer at Tham Engineering Pte Ltd.

6.     The witness is Mollah Mohammad Tuhin, a 28-year-old Bangladeshi worker.

7.     On 21 April 2019, the victim attended a barbeque event for workers at BBQ pits 4 and 5 of West Coast Park. At about 3.30pm that day, the victim and the witness made their way to the toilet which was a short distance from BBQ pit 4.

8.     As they were halfway to the toilet, the Natarajan and Venkatachalam approached the victim. Natarajan punched the victim on his left upper and lower lips using his right fist, causing the victim to fall on the ground and land on his left elbow. While the victim was on the ground, Venkatachalam kicked the victim’s left elbow. As the victim lay on the ground, both accused persons continued to punch him. By repeatedly punching the victim, the accused persons knew that they were likely to cause grievous hurt to the victim. The assault ended only after the witness and the victim’s boss intervened.

9.     The victim was seen at the National University Hospital (“**NUH**”) at about 4.36pm that day. The medical report by NUH states the victim suffered a dislocation of the left elbow joint with effusion and facial lacerations comprising a 2-cm external skin laceration and a 4-cm inner mucosa laceration as well as a 0.5-cm external skin laceration and a 3-cm inner mucosal laceration. The victim underwent manipulation and reduction of left elbow dislocation under procedural sedation and toilet and suture of his facial lacerations. He was discharged and given hospitalisation leave of 14 days.

10.    The victim incurred $440.90 in medical expenses, the breakdown of which is as follows:

> a)     $121.00 (Invoice dated 21 April 2019 from the National University Hospital) paid by the victim’s company, Tham Engineering Pte Ltd;

> b)     $46.00 (Invoice dated 29 April 2019 from the National University Polyclinics) paid by the victim;

> c)     $136.95 (Invoice dated 2 May 2019 from the National University Hospital) paid by the victim; and

> d)     $136.95 (Invoice dated 30 May 2019 from the National University Hospital) paid by the victim.

In total, the victim paid $319.90 of the medical expenses and the victim’s company paid $121.00 of medical expenses on the victim’s behalf.

[^2]: ‘Harm’ is a measure of the injury which has been caused to society by the commission of the offence. See also _Public Prosecutor v Koh Thiam Huat_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 123</span> at \[41\], _Public Prosecutor v Aw Tai Hock_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 240</span> at \[33\], _Public Prosecutor v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 306</span> at \[57\], and _Wong Meng Hang v SMC_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 253</span> at \[30(a)\]. For completeness, harm may:(a) Cleave into “physical harm” and “psychological harm” for maid abuse cases under s 323 read with s 73(2) of the Penal Code: _Tay Wee Kiat and another v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 42</span> at \[70\]-\[72\]; and(b) Include serious economic loss to the victim under s 17(1) of the Medical Registration Act: _Neo Ah Luan v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 188</span> at \[69\].

[^3]: ‘Culpability’ is a measure of the degree of relative blameworthiness disclosed by an offender’s actions and is measured chiefly in relation to the extent and manner of the offender’s involvement in the criminal act. See also _Public Prosecutor v Koh Thiam Huat_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 123</span> at \[41\], _Public Prosecutor v Aw Tai Hock_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 240</span> at \[35\], _Public Prosecutor v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 306</span> at \[57\], and _Wong Meng Hang v SMC_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 253</span> at \[30(b)\]. See also Andrew Ashworth, _Sentencing and Criminal Justice_ (6th Edition, 2015, Cambridge University Press) at \[4.5\].

[^5]: See also the five-step sentencing framework in _Logachev Vladislav v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 12</span> at \[71\]-\[84\], which is broadly similar to the 2-step sentencing bands framework in _Ng Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 37</span> at \[73(a), (c) and (d)\].

[^6]: Judge-made sentencing frameworks for a variety of statutory offences take the common form of a harm-culpability matrix which embeds in a fundamental way retributive thinking in the sentencing exercise: _Public Prosecutor v ASR_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGCA 16</span> at \[131\].

[^7]: The factors relating to harm and culpability often affect both considerations: _Low Song Chye v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 140</span> at \[79\]. A sentencing court should be mindful not to double count the offence-specific factors in its sentencing assessment: _Ye Lin Myint v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 221</span> at \[58\].

[^8]: In _Lim Teck Kim v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 99</span> at \[27\], the High Court stated that “to more accurately evaluate the appropriate amount of weight to be ascribed to each offence-specific factor (for offences under s 7 of the Protection from Harassment Act), (the High Court) therefore propose(d) a points system, whereby each offence-specific factor is given a range of points, allowing the sentencing judge to determine the appropriate number of points to be ascribed based on the intensity of the aggravating factor.”However, the High Court in _Sim Kang Wei v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 129</span> at \[29\]-\[44\] had reservations about the points system and declined to adopt the _Lim Teck Kim_ framework.

[^13]: “\[T\]here will be exceptional cases where the _harm_ caused by the offence can also be used to determine both the applicable category and where the particular case falls within the applicable presumptive sentencing range. One example of this would be where more than one death is caused, as in the present case”: _Public Prosecutor v Ganesan Sivasankar_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 176</span> at \[56\].

[^15]: This case dealt with the offence of voluntarily causing hurt to a public servant (police officers and public servants who are performing duties akin to police duties at the material time) under s 332 of the Penal Code.

[^16]: The two principal parameters which a sentencing court would generally have regard to in evaluating the seriousness of a crime are: (a) the harm caused by the offence, and (b) the offender’s culpability. _See Lim Ying Luciana v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 1220</span> at \[28\], _Public Prosecutor v Tan Thian Earn_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 269</span> at \[19\], _Public Prosecutor v Koh Thiam Huat_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 123</span> at \[41\], and _Public Prosecutor v Ganesan Sivasankar_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 176</span> at \[33\] and \[53\]-\[56\].
