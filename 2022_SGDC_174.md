Evidence – Witnesses – Section 62A of the Evidence Act 1893

3 August 2022 - Judgment reserved.

### District Judge Chiah Kok Khun:

## Introduction

1       This is an application for leave to give evidence via video link, and is made in the wake of _Wang Xiaopu v Koh Mui Lee and others_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGHC 54</span> (“_Wang Xiaopu_”), a very recent decision of the High Court dealing with the question of remote hearings. The advent of the Covid-19 pandemic (“pandemic”) has seen the widespread use of the court’s powers to admit remote evidence of witnesses who are overseas, on the basis that they are unable to travel to Singapore. Evidence given remotely via video link has become common place in our courts. In _Wang Xiaopu_ (at \[13\]), the High Court cautioned against blindly citing the pandemic as a reason as to why a witness is unable to travel to Singapore to give evidence, in applying for leave for evidence to be given remotely. The High Court was of the view that the pandemic situation appeared to have stabilised and mere generalisations about travel disruptions brought on by the pandemic are insufficient to explain why a witness is unable to travel.

2       The defendants in the present case cited _Wang Xiaopu_ in resisting the application by the plaintiff for leave to give evidence via video link from Bangladesh. On _the specific facts of the case_ before me, I disallowed the plaintiff’s application. Notwithstanding my decision, I am of the view that we should be mindful of any regression from the widespread adoption of remote hearings achieved during the pandemic. There should not be a reversion to the pre-pandemic state of affairs, where remote hearings were allowed only in exceptional circumstances. We need to guard against any degree of abandonment of remote hearings, and losing the many attendant advantages of efficiency, convenience and costs savings. I will return to this later in the judgment.

3       The underlying suit in which this application is made was commenced by the plaintiff for injuries suffered as a result of an accident whilst working at a building project at the junction of Paya Lebar Road and Sims Avenue (“the worksite”).[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) The plaintiff was a construction worker. It is the plaintiff’s pleaded case that he was assigned to remove a plastic laminate from a glass window panel whilst standing on a ladder at the worksite. When the plaintiff was standing on top of the ladder, the plastic laminate tore away from the window panel which caused the plaintiff to lean backwards. This resulted in the plaintiff losing his balance and falling off the ladder (“the accident”).[^2] The plaintiff asserts that he suffered injuries to his lower back, left thigh and left knee. He claims that the injuries resulted in permanent disabilities, including chronic back pain.[^3] He contends that he is unable to return to work as a construction worker. The plaintiff claims against the defendants in negligence and breach of statutory duties for the injuries suffered by him as a result of the accident.[^4]

4       The 1st defendant was the employer of the plaintiff and the sponsor of his work permit. It was essentially a supplier of labour. The 1st defendant’s case is that it did not have management, care and control over the worksite and the works carried out therein.[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5) It is therefore not the correct defendant. The 1st defendant also contends that the accident was caused by the plaintiff’s own negligence.[^6] The 2nd defendant was the project manager of the worksite. The thrust of the 2nd defendant’s case is that there were no witnesses to the accident. The 2nd defendant noted that when the plaintiff saw a doctor at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital four days after the accident, the medical examination showed that the plaintiff only suffered from back pain. It was only about a year later, when the plaintiff consulted a private specialist that he was diagnosed with chronic back pain and other injuries, with resulting permanent disabilities.[^7] The 2nd defendant therefore casts doubts on the plaintiff’s claims for injuries suffered. The 2nd defendant further pointed out that whilst the plaintiff filed this suit against the labour supplier (1st defendant) and the project manager of the worksite (2nd defendant), he did not make claims against either the main contractor or the sub-contractor who assigned him the work.[^8] The 2nd defendant accordingly raises the issue of the credibility of the plaintiff in filing his claim.

5       The matter has been set down for a bifurcated trial on liability. The plaintiff hailed from Bangladesh and had since filing the claim returned home. He does not hold any Singapore work or visit pass. The plaintiff applied for leave to be granted to him to give evidence at the trial by a live video link from Bangladesh, pursuant to s 62A of the Evidence Act 1893 (“EA”).

6       The 1stdefendant objects to the application on the basis there is no evidence that the plaintiff took steps to enable himself to give evidence in person. He has not shown that he is precluded by the pandemic situation from travelling to Singapore to give evidence at the trial. The 1st defendant points out that the plaintiff has conceded that immigration entry requirements have been relaxed; and the plaintiff has not shown that he had applied for a visa but was unable to obtain one.

7       The 2nd defendant likewise objects to the application, and contends that the plaintiff is “not unable” to travel to Singapore to testify in person under s 62A of the EA. The 2nd defendant argues that the plaintiff will not be unfairly prejudiced if he is to come to Singapore to testify; whilst the 1st and 2nd defendants will be unfairly prejudiced if the plaintiff does not come to Singapore to give evidence in person. The 2nd defendant also contends that the plaintiff has not shown that there are adequate and sufficient technical arrangements for him to give evidence via video link from Bangladesh.

8       The law in relation to giving evidence via video link is largely uncontroverted. The general principle is that a witness must physically be in court to testify: _Anil Singh Gurm v J S Yeh & Co and another_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 555</span> (“_Anil Singh_”) at \[2\]. The court however has powers to allow evidence to be admitted via video link. In particular, s 62A of the EA allows the court to grant leave for evidence to be given via video link in certain situations. In the present case, the plaintiff relies on s 62A in support of his application for leave to give remote evidence.

9       Section 62A of the EA states as follows:

> **Evidence through live video or live television links**

> 62A.—(1)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, a person may, with leave of the court, give evidence through a live video or live television link in any proceedings, other than proceedings in a criminal matter, if —

>> (_a_)    the witness is below the age of 18 years;

>> (_b_)    it is expressly agreed between the parties to the proceedings that evidence may be so given;

>> (_c_)    the witness is outside Singapore; or

>> (_d_)    the court is satisfied that it is expedient in the interests of justice to do so.

> (2)    In considering whether to grant leave for a witness outside Singapore to give evidence by live video or live television link under this section, the court shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the following:

>> (_a_)    the reasons for the witness being unable to give evidence in Singapore;

>> (_b_)    the administrative and technical facilities and arrangements made at the place where the witness is to give his evidence; and

>> (c)    whether any party to the proceedings would be unfairly prejudiced.

> (3)    The court may, in granting leave under subsection (1), make an order on all or any of the following matters:

>> (a)    the persons who may be present at the place where the witness is giving evidence;

>> …

>> (h)    any other order the court considers necessary in the interests of justice.

> (4)    The court may revoke, suspend or vary an order made under this section if —

>> (a)    the live video or live television link system stops working and it would cause unreasonable delay to wait until a working system becomes available;

>> (b)    it is necessary for the court to do so to comply with its duty to ensure that the proceedings are conducted fairly to the parties thereto;

>> (c)    it is necessary for the court to do so, so that the witness can identify a person or a thing or so that the witness can participate in or view a demonstration or an experiment;

>> (d)    it is necessary for the court to do so because part of the proceedings is being heard outside a courtroom; or

>> (e)    there has been a material change in the circumstances after the court has made an order.

> (5)    The court shall not make an order under this section, or include a particular provision in such an order, if to do so would be inconsistent with the court’s duty to ensure that the proceedings are conducted fairly to the parties to the proceedings.

> …

> (8)    Where a witness gives evidence in accordance with this section, he shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to be giving evidence in the presence of the court.

> …

## Issue

10     The issue that arises for determination in this case is therefore whether s 62A of the EA permitted the grant of leave to a witness in the position of the plaintiff to give evidence via video link.

## Analysis and findings

### The court’s power to allow evidence to be given via video link

11     It should be noted at the outset that the court’s power to allow evidence to be given via video link is not newly acquired. The Court of Appeal noted in _Anil Singh_ at \[37\] that s 62A, which was passed only in 1996, was enacted to clarify and enlarge the court’s powers in relation to evidence given by live video and television links. The court’s powers in relation to giving evidence via video and television links were thus in existence _before_ the enactment of s 62A. Section 62A is therefore not the provision that enables the giving of evidence by live video and television links. It merely clarified and enlarged the existing court’s powers to allow such evidence.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9) Section 62A should therefore not be taken as prescriptive of when leave should be granted for evidence to be given via video link. Instead, s 62A is a provision that allows the court to grant leave for evidence to be given via video link in certain situations. It is thus not the case that leave of court would be granted for evidence to be given via video link _only_ when s 62A is satisfied. The court has the powers to grant such leave outside of the situations described in s 62A.

12     The plaintiff has invoked s 62A in applying for leave for the plaintiff to give evidence at the trial by a live video link from Bangladesh. With the context of s 62A as discussed above in place, I turn now to examine its application in the present case.

13     In the present case, the requirement under s 62A(1)(c) of the EA was satisfied as the plaintiff made the application on grounds that he is outside of Singapore. However, in considering whether leave should be granted, s 62A(2) of the EA states that the court is to take into account all the circumstances of the case. In this regard, three limbs are set out in sub-ss 62A(2)(a) to 62A(2)(_c_) in respect of various matters to be considered. I will discuss each of the three limbs in turn.

### Whether witness is unable or unwilling to give evidence in Singapore

14     I turn first to s 62A(2)(a) which requires the court to consider the reasons for the witness being unable to give evidence in Singapore. I shall start with the defendants’ position that the plaintiff has not shown that he is unable to come to Singapore to testify as required under s 62A(2)(a).[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10) The defendants say that leave should be denied to the plaintiff to give evidence via video link as he is able to come to Singapore to give evidence. He is merely unwilling to do so. The defendants referred to _Anil Singh_ where it was held at \[38\] that in determining whether to grant leave under s 62A(1)(c), the court will examine whether a witness is in fact unable to travel to Singapore.

15     In this regard, I note that it was held in _Wang Xiaopu_ at \[10\] that s 62A(2)(_a_) does not cover situations where “the witness is able to, but unwilling to, attend proceedings in Singapore”. The High Court held that the use of the word “unable” implies a lack of choice on the witness’s part. In so holding, the High Court referred to _Anil Singh_ at \[30\]. The High Court also referred (at \[11\]) to _Bachmeer Capital Ltd v Ong Chih Ching and others_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 29</span> (“_Bachmeer Capital_”) at \[19\]; and _Anil Singh_ at \[39\], and held that when it is inconvenient for a witness to travel to Singapore, it does not mean that he is “unable” to do so.

16     In my view, a closer look at the Court of Appeal’s judgment in _Anil Singh_ is warranted. Whilst it was held by the Court of Appeal at \[30\] and \[38\] that for purposes of s 62A(2)(a), witnesses would only be held to be unable to travel to Singapore if they were prevented from doing so by circumstances outside their control, it is pertinent to note that the Court of Appeal also held that s 62A(2)(a) is not meant to operate as a pre-condition or a fetter on the court’s broad discretion to consider all the circumstances of a case under s 62A(2) (at \[36\]).

17     In fact, the Court of Appeal in _Anil Singh_ took the view that the effect of s 62A as a whole is to provide the court with a broad discretion to receive oral evidence by video link in civil proceedings, and that the court has the power to allow witnesses to testify via video link in almost all conceivable situations that may arise in civil proceedings. In my view, this is the thrust of the decision in _Anil Singh_. The Court of Appeal pointed to s 62A(3)(h) and noted that the court is given wide powers to make any order that it considers necessary in the interests of justice. It noted that the only stipulated limit on this power is found in s 62A(5), which provides that the court shall not grant leave under s 62A if doing so would be inconsistent with its duty to ensure that the proceedings are conducted fairly to the parties to the proceedings (at \[34\]).

18     The Court of Appeal also referred to the opening words of subsection s 62A(2) and pointed out that the words direct at the very beginning that the court “shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case”, before the subsection sets out the three specific limbs for the court’s consideration, the first of which relates to the reasons for the witness’s inability to testify in the courtroom itself. It went on to hold that while that requirement means that such applications would usually be made by reason of some inability to travel on the part of the witness, the requirement cannot by itself override the mandate to the court at the beginning to take all the circumstances into account. The Court of Appeal further held that the mandate under s 62A(2) indicates that the court is not meant to be constrained in the factors that it may take into account in deciding an application for leave to give evidence via video link. The court may in its discretion determine in the light of other material facts, whether it should disallow the application on the basis of the non-fulfilment of the requirement of inability to travel. In this regard, the Court of Appeal was of the view that subsection s 62A(2), in alignment with the purpose of s 62A, is likewise meant to provide the court with a broad discretion to receive oral evidence by video link in civil proceedings.

19     It can thus be seen that the Court of Appeal was of the view that a witness’s unwillingness to travel is not by itself determinative of an application for leave under s 62A. Whilst unwillingness to travel is an important factor, whether the weight of that factor could be displaced would depend on a holistic assessment of the circumstances of each case (see \[41\]). In other words, leave should not be denied to a witness to give evidence via video link _solely_ because he is able to come to Singapore to give evidence but is unwilling to do so. In my view, this is the key significance of the decision in _Anil Singh_. In fact, it is the pivotal holding of the case, upon which the Court of Appeal disagreed with the High Court judge and allowed the appeal against his decision to refuse leave to grant video link evidence. Its significance however is often missed for the discussion in the judgement regarding the meaning of “unable” to travel to Singapore to testify, as opposed to unwilling to do so, and the holding that witnesses would only be held to be unable to travel to Singapore if they were prevented from doing so by circumstances outside their control. _Anil Singh_ is invariably cited by counsel for the proposition that leave to give evidence remotely should not be granted to a witness who though able, is unwilling to travel to Singapore.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11) This is a misapprehension. As seen, it is in fact to the contrary, and _Anil Singh_ does not support such a proposition. _Anil Singh_ in fact made it clear that inability to travel to Singapore is not a requirement that has to be satisfied in every case where leave is granted. A less than careful reading of _Anil Singh_ could result in a case of missing the woods for the trees.

20     Turning to the facts of the present case, the plaintiff’s contention is that he is unable to travel to Singapore to give evidence at the trial. In this regard, it should be noted that it was held in _Anil Singh_ that “unable” to travel would clearly include situations involving physical or legal inability, such as where the witness cannot travel to Singapore because of a medical condition or because of travel restrictions imposed by the authorities of his country of residence. It would also include situations where a witness cannot travel because of real and substantial threats to his personal safety. More importantly, it was held that there would be situations where the line between choice and inability may not be clear, and a bright-line rule cannot be laid down. The question of whether a witness is unable to travel to Singapore is one that has to be assessed on the facts of each case (at \[38\]).

21     In the present case, the plaintiff says that he is unable to travel to Singapore to testify because of his financial constraints. He maintains that he is willing to come to Singapore, but he has no means to raise the costs of the travel arrangements. The plaintiff is unable to bear the costs of the flight, hotel, and food.[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12) However, despite the urging of the defendants and the court, the plaintiff did not produce any form of evidence that he is unable to raise the costs of making the travel arrangements to Singapore.[^13] At the hearing before me, I raise the question of the costs of travelling to Singapore to give evidence as compared to giving remote evidence from Bangladesh. In applications for leave to give evidence via video link, there is a requirement under practice direction 52A of the State Courts Practice Directions 2014 for the applicant to show that there is no prohibition imposed by the foreign country against the giving of evidence by a witness situated in that country for court proceedings in Singapore. A common step taken by applicants to fulfil this requirement is to obtain a legal opinion of a foreign lawyer qualified to advise on the laws of that foreign country that there is no such legal impediment. Such advice has in fact been obtained in the present case. There are naturally costs attendant to the obtaining of such advice. It is also common for a foreign law firm to host the giving of the remote evidence in a private room of its offices, at a fee. This is to fulfil the consideration of the administrative and technical facilities and arrangements at the place where the witness is to give his evidence, a requirement under 62A(2)(_b_) of the EA. This adds further to the costs of giving remote evidence.

22     The plaintiff’s counsel was directed to provide the comparative costs of the plaintiff travelling to Singapore to give evidence and giving remote evidence from Bangladesh for the court’s consideration. However, despite several occasions given for counsel to do so, the information was not furnished. There is thus no evidence before me that the costs of the arrangements for the plaintiff to give evidence via video link in this particular case would be cheaper than the costs of the plaintiff’s travel arrangements to enable him to be present at the trial. There is also no evidence that the plaintiff is unable to afford the costs of travelling to Singapore to give evidence.

23     I am therefore not in a position to find that the plaintiff has shown that he is unable to travel to Singapore to give evidence. But as discussed above, that is not the end of the question. I have the discretion to determine in the light of other material facts, whether I should disallow the application on the basis of the non-fulfilment of the requirement of inability to travel. The other material facts would include the matters set out in s 62A(2)(_b_) and s 62A(2)(_c_).

### Consideration of administrative and technical facilities and arrangements

24     In this regard, I turn next to s 62A(2)(_b_), which refers to the consideration of the administrative and technical facilities and arrangements at the place where the witness is to give his evidence. This consideration is often expressed as a concern with the reliability of technology used to facilitate the giving of evidence via video link. In this regard, the pandemic has taught us much about the common perception of the unreliability of technology. Whilst capricious at times, technology remains largely a faithful servant to a patient master. Many remote hearings, including some involving examination of overseas witnesses have proceeded successfully with minimal disruption. There is no dispute that the applicant would have to provide evidence to persuade the court of the availability of technology and administrative facilities for remote hearing and that those arrangements are adequate to ensure smooth conduct of the hearing. But the experience gleaned from the many trials that had proceeded during the pandemic in the State Courts with one or more witnesses appearing via video link is that this requirement seldom posed any obstacle. Whilst a level of detail must be provided in the supporting affidavit to satisfy the court that the necessary administrative and technical arrangements have been made to facilitate the witness’s remote testimony, the importance of such evidence to be provided at the time of the application should not be overstated.

25     Given the nature of technology, it can never be fail-safe. There is no purpose in requiring an applicant to provide unwarranted assurances of technical nature. In any event, it is now common practice in the State Courts for court officers to conduct dry runs of video link hearing by testing the connection together with the applicant solicitors. Such tests, which are conducted a few days before the trial, would ensure that there was a video link of sufficient quality that would enable the witness to testify. I do not see any reason why the court should require evidence beyond details such as the proposed venue, the availability of the necessary equipment, adequate connectivity and the assurance of privacy when the video link evidence is given. Any details beyond these would not add meaningfully to the considerations in regard to whether to allow video link evidence. In my view, the requirement under s 62A(2)(b) that the court should have regard to the administrative and technical facilities and arrangements made at the place where the witness is to give his evidence, should not be turned into a pointless burden on an applicant to provide technical details or unrealistic assurances.

26     In the present case, the plaintiff states that he will be giving his evidence at the trial in a private room at the premises of a law office in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The staff of the law office would provide the technical facilities and set up the equipment. They would be at hand to assist with any administrative arrangements or technical issues.[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14) The plaintiff has thus provided information on the proposed venue, the availability of the necessary equipment, adequate connectivity and the assurance of privacy when the video link evidence is given. In my view, the requirement under s 62A(2)(_c_) is satisfied.

### Whether any party to the proceedings would be unfairly prejudiced

27     I turn next to s 62A(2)(_c_), under which the court must consider whether any party to the proceedings would be unfairly prejudiced if video link evidence is granted, in a manner that cannot be compensated by an appropriate costs order. The question of unfair prejudice has been held to be an overriding consideration when determining if leave should be granted under s 62A: _Anil Singh_ at \[64\] citing _Sonica Industries Ltd v Fu Yu Manufacturing Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 3 SLR(R) 119</span> (“_Sonica Industries_”) at \[15\]. It is usual for parties advancing a case that they would be unfairly prejudiced if video link evidence is granted to raise the common concerns associated with remote hearing. In this regard, some common concerns relating to remote hearing might in my view be overstated. I will address these concerns in turn.

28     The first is the concern that justice must be seen to be done, and remote hearing would not be conducive to justice been seen to be done. I am of the view that this is a concern that is less valid than it seems. In present times, remote hearing is not necessarily anathema to justice been seen to be done. The world is moving inexorably to a wider acceptance of the integration of the real and virtual world. An example is the advent of the metaverse. In my view, a day in court need not mean that all elements of a trial must be physical. In particular, having some aspects only of a trial conducted remotely, as opposed to the entire trial, may not necessarily detract from the overall import of a physical trial. A witness, even a material one, appearing on a screen in a courtroom where the judge sits and where the trial is taking place, does not necessarily diminish the overall tone of a physical trial, nor the _gravitas_ of the courtroom. There is no reason why having a segment of a trial conducted via video conference would in any way reduce the perception of independence, integrity and impartiality of the court proceedings.

29     Second is the concern that it would be harder to assess a witness’s demeanour and credibility when evidence is given via video link. In my view, the importance of the demeanour of witnesses to fact finding is often misplaced.

30     In _Anil Singh_, the Court of Appeal noted at \[71\]:

> 71    Second, although there was a real likelihood that the trial court’s decision in Suit 580 would turn on the trial judge’s assessment of the witnesses’ credibility, this would not have resulted in unfair prejudice to the respondents if leave were granted. As this court observed in _Sandz Solutions (Singapore) Pte Ltd and others v Strategic Worldwide Assets Ltd and others_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 3 SLR 562</span> at \[42\], a court’s assessment of a witness’s credibility would, and should, seldom hinge on that witness’s demeanour on the stand (_ie_, behavioural patterns that are not reflected on the transcript, see Thomas Bingham, _The Business of Judging_ (Oxford University Press, 2000) at p 8). As such, we were not persuaded that a trial judge’s assessment of a witness’s credibility would be hindered if that witness was not some “ten feet away in the witness box” (see, _eg_, _Asia-Pac Infrastructure Development Ltd v Ing Yim Leung, Alexander and others_ \[2011\] 1 HKLRD 587 (“_Asia-Pac Infrastructure_”) at \[62\]; _Polanski_ (CA) (\[51\] supra), per Simon Brown LJ at \[29\]; _Bachmeer Capital_ (\[47\] _supra_) at \[18\]). In any case, trial judges can take into account any particular deficiencies arising from the use of video link testimony when deciding on the weight to be assigned to a witness’s evidence (_McGlinn v Waltham Contractors Ltd and others (No 2)_ \[2006\] EWHC 2322 (TCC) at \[11\]). We noted that it has been observed that “the solemnity of the court atmosphere and the threat of immediate sanction” was conducive to obtaining truthful testimony from a witness (_Re Chow Kam Fai ex parte Rambas Marketing Co LLC_ \[2004\] 1 HKLRD 161 (“_Re Chow Kam Fai (CFI)_”) at \[28\]; _Erceg v Erceg_ (\[66\] supra) at \[14\]). In our view, however, questions about a particular witness’s truthfulness would be a matter for a trial judge to determine based on all the evidence before the court. It is, therefore, unhelpful for us to speculate as to whether, generally speaking, testifying in court necessarily encourages witnesses to be more truthful than when testifying via video link.

31     I respectfully agree. In my view, the ability to assess a witness’s credibility from his demeanour is overstated. The demeanour of a witness on the stand hinges on factors beyond truthfulness. The personality and psychological make-up of the person would matter much. A self-confident individual may appear to be more honest. A person of nervous disposition may seem untruthful on the stand. Other factors like education, social standing, eloquence, and even appearance may have a halo effect on any evaluation of demeanour. In my view, such halo effect tends to be outsized, rendering judging credibility on the basis of demeanour at best unsafe.

32     In fact, I note that the High Court in _Wang Xiaopu_ referred to the above passage in _Anil Singh_ and held that because the court’s assessment of a witness’s credibility seldom hinges on their demeanour when on the stand, whether the witness testifies remotely or in person makes little difference as to the court’s assessment of their credibility (at \[27\]).

33     In the present case, the defendants contend that they would be prejudiced by having the plaintiff testify remotely as it would be harder to assess his demeanour and credibility. This leads me next to the question of the status of the witness in the proceedings for whom leave is sought to give remote evidence.

34     The Court of Appeal in _Anil Singh_ is of the view that a witness’s status in the litigation would influence the threshold for granting leave to give evidence via video link. It was of the view that the court should generally be more willing to grant leave to a witness who is not a party to the litigation and has no control over it (at \[53\]). The reasoning is that a party or for that matter, a witness who desires the fruits of a litigation brought in a particular forum should generally be expected to attend proceedings in the court of that forum to obtain justice. These considerations would also apply if the witness in question, though not a party to the litigation, controlled the conduct of the litigation. On the other hand, the threshold for granting leave to non-party witnesses should generally be low, and a non-party witness’s unwillingness to travel to Singapore is to be given little significance as a factor against the granting of leave (at \[44\]-\[46\]).

35     In other words, in the light of the views of the Court of Appeal, in considering as a factor against granting leave for evidence to be given remotely, the order of the weight to be attached to a witness’s unwillingness to travel to Singapore would be as follows. The weight to be attached to the witness’s unwillingness is significantly greater where the person concerned is a plaintiff who has chosen to bring proceedings in Singapore. Less weight would be given in the case of a defendant who has not, after all, chosen the venue of Singapore for the proceedings. And finally, even less weight would be applied in the case of a mere witness who is unwilling to travel to Singapore. To this list I would add expert witnesses, who would be placed at the bottom of the list. There should be little objection to an expert giving evidence via video link when he is unwilling to travel to Singapore to give evidence. The discussion above in respect to assessing the demeanour and credibility of witnesses applies with greater force when it concerns an expert. It is the expert’s opinion that the court is assessing. The decision that the court has to make is whether to accept an expert’s opinion, or not. The demeanour of the expert when giving his expert evidence should have little role, if at all, in the court making this decision. Except in special circumstances, there is little reason to insist on an expert giving his opinion in person at the trial.

36     Turning back to the present case, I note that the application is for the plaintiff to give evidence via video link.[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15) The 2nd Defendant has raised the issue of the veracity of the plaintiff’s claim under the suit.[^16] The 2nd defendant highlighted that the accident was not witnessed by anyone. Moreover, only back pain was diagnosed when the plaintiff saw a doctor four days after the accident at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital.[^17] But a year later, when he went to see a private specialist, he was diagnosed with chronic back pain and other injuries, including injuries to the left thigh and left knee. The diagnosis also referred to permanent disabilities arising from these injuries.[^18] The 2nd defendant further noted that the plaintiff chose to make claims against the labour suppliers and owners of the worksite but did not sue either the main contractor or the sub-contractors. The 2nd defendant therefore contends that it is important for the plaintiff to be in person at the trial to be confronted with these matters. Given the specific facts before me, I agree. In view of the specific matters raised by the defendants, I am of the view that the defendants would be unfairly prejudiced if video link evidence is granted, in a manner that cannot be compensated by an appropriate costs order. As the question of unfair prejudice is an overriding consideration when determining if leave should be granted under s 62A, I am unable to grant leave to the plaintiff to give evidence via video link.

## Conclusion

37     On the facts of this case, I disallow the plaintiff’s application for leave to give evidence via video link. However, I reiterate that I have arrived at the outcome on the _specific facts_ of this case. Each case must turn on its facts. In my view, there should not be any overall shift away from remote hearings on account of the pandemic stabilising, or even when endemic ensues. If there is to be any shift in position, it should be limited only to a more stringent examination of the matters pertaining to the first limb of s 62A(2) as discussed above. There may be a need now for clearer evidence of any inability to travel to Singapore to give evidence, as compared to when we were in the throes of the pandemic.

38     Whilst the pandemic _appears_ to be stabilising, I make two observations. The first is that there is still uncertainty as to the direction the pandemic will take. Just before the time of writing this judgment, the Ministry of Health reported that Singapore recorded its highest daily number of infections in more than three months.[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19) Health Minister Mr Ong Ye Kung also announced that a new wave of Covid-19 has arrived.[^20] It is plainly too early to say with certainty one way or the other, how the pandemic would progress. Second, travel disruptions brought on by the pandemic in the present context would, by definition, be much dependent on the policies adopted by various foreign countries. In this regard, such policies are not only far from being uniform globally, they are also subject to constant fluctuation. The situation is still ambiguous. Any change of tack in our approach to remote hearings is arguably premature. There is no reason for any haste in this regard.

39     In any event, even when the pandemic eventually runs its course, and life reverts to normalcy, it is important that we do not lose the grounds gained during the pandemic in harnessing technology for use in court proceedings. Such use of technology had enhanced access to justice during the pandemic, and there is no reason why it should not continue to do so after the pandemic. These gains, which were made on the back of the many pains caused by the pandemic should not be mindlessly discarded. We must be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. As we emerge from the pandemic, we should be mindful not to unwittingly roll back the many new measures to expedite court processes which the courts were able to implement by reason of the pandemic. Some of these measures were many years in the waiting pending implementation. Prime examples of such measures are asynchronous and video link hearings. The circumstances brought about by the pandemic resulted in widespread acceptance of these measures and thereby facilitating immediate implementation during the pandemic. These measures introduced efficiencies to court processes and enhanced access to the courts. More importantly, a mindset change has taken place in the adoption by litigants of these measures, and it is paramount that this mindset change is preserved.

40     Whilst the general principle is that a witness must physically be in court to testify (_Anil Singh_ (\[8\] _supra_) at \[2\]), there is no reason why parties should not agree for a particular witness who is located overseas to participate in a physical trial via video link, if doing so would enable the case to proceed to trial quicker. Needless to say, the usual requirements under the practice directions must be complied with, including arrangements for administrative and technical facilities at the place where the witness is to give his evidence. The witness must also show that there is no legal impediment imposed by the foreign country in which he proposes to give remote evidence for court proceedings in Singapore.[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21) Time savings, together with costs savings, should always be a pertinent consideration for parties, as for the court. Expeditious proceedings should always be one of the ideals in civil procedure.[^22] In my view, good sense needs to prevail over blind adherence to the letter of the law. Parties should work together to give precedence to expeditious completion of cases.

41     There is added impetus for the expeditious disposal of cases in the State Courts. This stems from both the number and nature of cases placed before the State Courts. There is a high volume of cases filed in the State Courts. A significant proportion of the cases involve claims for damages arising from personal injuries. On top of the large number of cases filed, under the Supreme Court of Judicature (Transfer of Specified Proceedings to District Court) Order 2016, proceedings in cases up to the value of $500,000 filed in the High Court involving claims arising out of road traffic accidents and claims for injuries sustained in industrial accidents are transferred to the State Courts. Further, going hand in hand with the large number of cases in the State Courts is the lower value of these cases. This gives rise to another consideration in deciding applications for leave to give remote evidence. This is the proportionality principle in civil proceedings.[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23) With monetary jurisdiction capped at $250,000 (barring the transferred cases referred to above), the relatively smaller value of cases brings to the fore the consideration of proportionality. Proceedings should be undertaken in a manner that is proportionate to the value of these cases. Costly and protracted determination of such cases is not justified. Proceedings should be expeditious and inexpensive in view of the smaller value of the claims. Moreover, the proportionality principle extends beyond consideration of the value of claims. The manner of how proceedings are carried out should also be proportionate to the complexity of the cases and the nature of the claims. Given the uncomplex nature of most cases filed in the State Courts, the emphasis should be on expedience in the conclusion of cases. In this regard, video link hearing avails itself in appropriate situations as a useful tool for expeditious adjudication of cases.

42     Further, as alluded to above, a significant proportion of the actions filed in the State Courts are claims for damages arising from personal injuries, including injuries sustained in industrial accidents. The claimants in these cases would naturally desire the earliest determination of their claims, and such cases would benefit from expeditious adjudication. In this respect, there would be situations where remote hearings could facilitate the expedient and inexpensive determination of cases. A common situation would be where the claimant having suffered injuries from an industrial accident, is unable to work for his employer in Singapore, and has returned to his home country. Such cases involving injured migrant workers who have returned to their home country after sustaining injuries raise the question of access to court hearings, and by extension, access to justice. In some situations, remote hearings could be the answer, and provide the accessibility. One such situation would be where there is evidence of prohibitive costs attendant to the claimant travelling to Singapore to testify, and where remote hearing is the affordable alternative. Remote hearings thus have a role in promoting access to justice, by improving accessibility to court hearings. Such accessibility is particularly important in cases filed in the State Courts, where the proportionality principle is often in sharp focus, stemming from the lower value of the claims in these cases.

43     Remote hearings therefore occupy an important place in the facilitation of expeditious civil proceedings in our courts. They also play a key role in enhancing access to justice. Remote hearings are no less important even as we begin to emerge from the pandemic. We were moved to embrace technology during the pandemic in order to overcome the ensuing constraints, and to maintain the efficient processing of cases. Having so adopted technology, there is no reason why we should be in any haste to part ways with it. In this regard, we should be wary of any regression in availing ourselves of technology.
