## The Case for the Prosecution

3       The prosecution called eight witnesses. I will summarise the salient aspects of their evidence.

#### Evidence of PW1 – Vinoth a/l Parmasivan (‘Vinoth’)

4       Vinoth is a Certis CISCO auxiliary police officer. He was attached to the National Environment Agency (‘NEA’) for about three years until 2017. He was issued with a NEA authority card.

5       On 18 November 2016, together with a party of 10 officers, he was involved in an anti-littering and smoking enforcement operation, which was referred to as a ‘Pub Blitz’ assignment, from 10pm to 3am. Amongst the 10 officers, the two supervisors were Gooi Choong How (‘Gooi’) and Chew Kah Heng (‘Chew’). Vinoth’s partner was Enforcement Officer Irwanshah Bin Ramlan (‘Irwan’). The first pub that they went to was 7th Heaven KTV located in The Grassroots’ Club.

6       Vinoth showed his NEA authority pass to the bouncers before commencing his observation rounds in the KTV for potential offenders. From about three meters away, he spotted the accused outside the toilet with a lighted cigarette in his mouth and approached him. He identified himself as a NEA officer by producing his NEA card, and informed the accused that he has committed an offence of smoking inside a prohibited place. He recalled that his colleagues Irwan and Navin were close to him at that point.

7       He requested the accused for his particulars to issue a Notice to Attend Court (‘ticket’). The accused denied that he had smoked and said he was going to the balcony to smoke. He asked to be given a chance. Vinoth repeated that he had committed an offence and asked the accused again for his particulars. The accused was unhappy. He showed his middle finger and said motherfucker. He told Vinoth that he will not provide his particulars. Vinoth recollected that the accused’s friend (later established to be Manjeet Singh s/o Banta Singh (‘Manjeet’)) was also present. He said that Manjeet also asked him to give the accused a chance. Manjeet also declined to furnish his particulars and asked him to call the police. Vinoth then asked his supervisor to call the police.

8       The accused proceeded to the balcony which was a short distance away and sat on a chair. He said that Manjeet also went to the balcony. He testified that the accused had his handphone with him and pretended to make a call. The accused told the alleged recipient that there were a lot of dogs in front of him who were stopping him from leaving. The accused also made the sound of a dog barking. Thereafter, the accused said that he wanted to return to his table to continue drinking. Vinoth allowed the accused to return to his table with Manjeet.

9       Vinoth, Irwan and Navin stood about three to four meters away from the accused’s table. He said only the accused and Manjeet were at the table. Whilst the accused was seated, he tried to splash some liquid in their direction. However, the liquid splashed onto another patron. Under cross-examination, he estimated the distance between the accused and himself was then about five meters. He disagreed that the accused did not splash liquid. He gave the following answers under cross-examination[^1]:

> Q    But you said unfortunately it hit a patron?

> A    Yes, correct.

> Q    What happened to that patron?

> A    That patron was angry with him and this---wanted to conversation with them like, uh, fighting. At that point of time, the---if I’m not remem---if I’m not wrong, the pub owner was come and---I think a lady come and settle both of them---

> Q    Okay.

> A    and they back to their table.

10     After the police arrived, Vinoth went to the ground floor. He was handed the accused’s NRIC by Senior Station Inspector Guok Joong Yin (‘Guok’) to issue the ticket. He stated that Manjeet was unhappy that Guok handed him the NRIC and told him that he would bring the matter up to the ‘Government’. After Vinoth had prepared the ticket, Guok told him that he will explain the mode of payment to the accused as the accused was unhappy with him (Vinoth). Vinoth then passed the ticket to Guok.

11     After receiving the ticket from Guok, the accused came in front of him (Vinoth). He said the accused was facing him and estimated that he was about one to two meters away. The accused tore a portion of the ticket with his teeth and some of the pieces dropped onto the floor. The accused then crumpled the remaining portion and threw it at Vinoth’s face. The ticket hit Vinoth lightly on his left temple. His supervisor told him to issue another ticket for littering. The accused told them to go ahead and issue it. As the accused was walking towards the lift, he uttered ‘NEA dogs’.

12     Vinoth was advised by his supervisor, Chew, to issue a ticket for littering. He approached the accused near to the lift to request for his NRIC to issue the ticket. The accused then showed him his middle finger. Subsequently, on the advice of the police a ticket was not issued for littering.

13     Under cross-examination, Vinoth disagreed that he did not show his NEA authority card although the accused had repeatedly asked him to produce his identification. He stated that in fact Navin and Irwan had also identified themselves to the accused and showed their respective passes. As regards Manjeet, he disagreed that he was not present when he stopped the accused outside the toilet and that he had only come to the balcony later. He said that Manjeet had also asked for a chance to be given to the accused. He was asked by learned counsel[^2]:

> Q    Did you tell them at any point that you are going to issue a summons against them?

> A    Yes, of course I did. I already mentioned them, uh, whatever, uh---what is the nature of offence they commit---and he did committed and I did explain twice, if I’m not wrong. And I say I need to issue a fine and I need your particulars.

> Q    Did you tell them what the fine amount was?

> A    No.

> Q    Why not?

> A    Once we print out the summon, then we will show to them.

14     Vinoth disagreed that the accused was four to five metres from him. He disagreed that the accused was not facing him but was to his left. He also disagreed that he (Vinoth) was to the left of Guok. He disagreed that the accused threw the ticket in a general direction and had no intention of throwing it at him. He disagreed that the ticket did not hit him. He said the accused was unhappy that he had issued the ticket and he was looking at him when he threw the ticket and the act was intentional.

#### Evidence of PW2 – Navin Kumar a/l Kumaranathan (‘Navin’)

15     Navin was an auxiliary police officer with Certis CISCO and attached to NEA. On 18 November 2016, he was involved in the raid at 7th Heaven KTV with nine colleagues. There were three other auxiliary police officers, four enforcement officers and two supervisors. He said the officers worked in pairs, i.e., one auxiliary police officer was paired with an enforcement officer. His partner was enforcement officer, Thambi Rajan (‘Thambi’). There was a short briefing before they left for the operation during which the auxiliary police officers had to show their NEA passes to the supervisors.

16     Upon arrival at the KTV, the teams split. Two teams went to conduct their surveillance on the right and the other two on the left. Navin was together with Vinoth’s team. From a distance of about three meters, he spotted the accused standing outside the toilet with a lighted cigarette in his mouth. The accused was together with a friend (Manjeet). He approached the accused with Vinoth. He was unable to remember where Thambi and Irwan were at that point.

17     He testified that Vinoth informed the accused that he was an enforcement officer with the NEA. Vinoth and him took out their NEA passes from their pockets and showed them to the accused. Vinoth informed the accused the nature of the offence he had committed and requested for his particulars. However, the accused did not provide his particulars. He said that Manjeet asked for a chance on behalf of the accused.

18     He testified that the accused walked to the balcony. Vinoth and him also entered the balcony. Navin was unable to remember what happened at the balcony. Later, the accused was allowed to leave the balcony. The accused returned to his table to continue drinking. Vinoth and him stood about two meters away and kept observation on the accused whilst waiting for the police. Whilst they were waiting, the accused tried to splash some liquid in their direction. Navin managed to dodge and the liquid splashed onto another patron who was behind him. He said the accused also pointed his finger towards Vinoth and him and said ‘NEA dogs’.

19     After the police arrived, Vinoth narrated the incident to them. He said that the accused, Manjeet and the NEA officers went down to the ground floor with the police. At the ground floor, the police assisted to obtain the NRIC of the accused. Vinoth then issued the ticket and handed it to the police to explain the mode of payment. However, before the police could explain the mode of payment, the accused took the ticket. The accused tore the ticket and threw it towards Vinoth’s face. He said the ticket hit Vinoth’s face but he was unable to remember where it hit him. Navin stated that he was standing behind the police officer and was on the righthand side of Vinoth, However, he was not in line but behind Vinoth. He said that Vinoth was further in front and nearer to the police. He estimated his distance from Vinoth to be about three metres.

20     After the accused had thrown the ticket towards Navin’s face, the walked towards the lift. He said that the NEA officers walked towards the accused to stop him. However, the accused showed his middle finger.

21     Under cross-examination, Navin disagreed that the accused was not shown a NEA pass. He disagreed that Manjeet was not with the accused outside the toilet. He stated that he was certain that Manjeet was with the accused and he had pleaded for a chance to be given to the accused. He disagreed that the accused did not try to splash liquid in his direction in the KTV.

22     At the ground floor, he agreed that Thambi was next to him. He agreed that he was to the right of Vinoth who was slightly in front of them. He stated that he was certain the ticket which the accused threw hit Vinoth on the face but he was unable to remember on which part of the face it had hit and what Vinoth did after the ticket hit him.

#### Evidence of PW3 – How Han Yong (‘Han Yong’)

23     Han Yong was an auxiliary officer with Certis Cisco and was attached to NEA as an enforcement officer. He testified that he was involved with nine other officers in the pub blitz operation on 18 November 2016.

24     Whilst he was patrolling in the KTV, he noticed Vinoth, Irwan, Navin and Thambi were outside the toilet with an offender. He approached them to ask if they required his assistance. He was told that the offender was refusing to provide his particulars. He was asked to call the Operations Room to activate the police. He informed his supervisor, Chew, that he will be calling the police.

25     Han Yong went out of the KTV to make the call at 10.44pm (see exh P1). He remained outside the KTV to wait for the police. Whilst waiting, he was told by a colleague that the accused had walked off. He then made a second call at 10.54pm. Whilst still waiting for the police, he was told by a colleague that the accused had tried to use something like a glass. Han Yong was unable to recall specifically what he was told but said it was to the effect that the accused was aggressive towards his colleagues. Han Yong then made a third call to the police at 10.58 pm (see exh P3). Thereafter, a colleague came to ask if the police has arrived. He made a fourth call at 11.07pm to ask the police to come as soon as possible. Han Yong was unable to recall who relayed the information to him which led to the four calls.

26     When the police arrived, he brought them into the KTV. He saw the police bringing the accused to the ground floor. He said the accused handed his NRIC to the police who then passed it to Vinoth to issue the ticket. Han Yong testified that he stood about 8 to 10 meters away and did not hear or see what else transpired.

#### Evidence of PW4 – Thambi Rajan Rajagopal (‘Thambi’)

27     Thambi is an officer with Certis Cisco. He is attached to NEA as an enforcement officer. On 18 November 2016, he was involved in the anti-smoking and anti-littering operation. His partner was Navin.

28     He entered the 7th Heaven KTV with Navin, Vinoth and Irwan. From a distance of about two meters, he saw the accused with a lighted cigarette in his mouth near to the entrance of the toilet. He said the place was dark and he could see the bright flame clearly. He said Vinoth was the first one to approach the accused. He saw Vinoth identifying himself as a NEA officer by showing his pass. He said Vinoth told the accused that he had committed an offence of smoking and asked him to produce his identification document. However, the accused did not comply. The accused said ‘NEA officers are dog’ and pointed his middle finger and said ‘motherfucker’.

29     Navin went to assist and showed his NEA pass. The accused then started to walk to the balcony. He estimated the distance of the balcony to be about four meters away. Asked if there was anyone else with the accused, he said that he did not notice because his focus was only on the accused. He said Vinoth, Navin and Irwan followed the accused and entered the balcony. Thambi stayed put. He noticed the accused’s friend (Manjeet) was also at the balcony. He did not see Manjeet prior to seeing him at the balcony. Thambi was unable to hear what transpired at the balcony. After a few minutes, the accused went back into the KTV. Vinoth, Navin, Irwan and him followed suit. Thereafter, Thambi went outside the KTV. He said that Han Yong had called the police and they were waiting for the police to arrive.

30     He went to the ground floor when the police arrived. According to him, he stood to the rear of Vinoth but was not directly behind him. He said he was standing on Vinoth’s right-hand side and estimated that he was about one to one and a half meters behind. He said that Navin was on his right. He saw the police officer obtaining the NRIC from the accused and passing it to Vinoth who issued the ticket and handed it to the police officer. He stated that after the police officer passed the ticket to the accused, he tore half of it with his teeth and threw the remainder directly at the face of Vinoth. He said the ticket landed on Vinoth’s face but he did not know where it had contacted.

31     It was his evidence that the accused was facing Vinoth when he threw the ticket and he estimated their distance to be about 1.5 meters.

#### Evidence of PW5 – Chew Kah Keng (‘Chew’)

32     Chew is a supervisor with Certis Cisco and is attached to NEA. On 18 November 2016, he was the enforcement supervisor for the anti-smoking pub blitz operation together with eight officers and one other supervisor. The eight officers were divided into four teams of two officers each consisting of an auxiliary police officer and an enforcement officer.

33     The 7thHeaven KTV was the first pub that they went to. He said that two teams went to the right of the pub and the other two teams went to the left. There were two smokers caught in the KTV. He was informed that the police had been activated because one person was uncooperative and refused to give his identification card.

34     Chew did not approach the accused. He said only Vinoth’s team and the assisting team led by Navin were involved. He went down to the ground floor to wait for the police. When the police arrived, they brought the accused down to the ground floor. Chew was about six meters away from the accused. He saw the accused handing his NRIC to the police officer who in turn handed it to Vinoth.

35     After the ticket was issued, Vinoth passed it to the police officer to hand to the accused. He saw the accused taking the ticket. He said that the accused was standing opposite to Vinoth at that point. He estimated the distance between them to be about one meter. He saw the accused tearing the ticket, putting it in his mouth and thereafter throwing a portion at the face of Vinoth. He stated that the ticket landed on Vinoth’s face but he was unable to discern the exact spot as the action was too fast. He recalled the accused walked towards the lift thereafter and said ‘dogs’. Chew testified that as the two police officers did not do anything, he made a phone call to the police at 11.27pm (see P5).

#### Evidence of PW6 – Staff Sergeant Mohamed Nazir s/o Jamaluddin (‘SSgt Nazir’)

36     SSgt Nazir was the initial investigation officer. He confirmed that the five reports in P1 to P5 were received on 18 November 2016 in connection with the incident.

37     He said the first responders at the scene were Guok and SC Sergeant Nasruddin. Subsequently, there were two other police cars that were dispatched to the scene. At about 12.30am, Station Inspector Jeremy (‘SI Jeremy’) informed him that the accused was arrested by Guok for an offence of using criminal force against a public servant and verbal abuse against a public servant. SSgt Nazir then called Guok to find out the facts.

38     He stated that Guok and SC Sgt Nasruddin had their body-worn cameras switched on. The relevant footage from SC Sgt Nasruddin’s body-worn camera was separated into footage A and B and the footage from Guok’s body-worn camera was labelled as footage C and D. The footage was admitted collectively as P18.

39     SSgt Nazir established from SI Jeremy that there was no CCTV footage at the building where the incident took place. In October 2017, he handed over investigations to Inspector Cheng Yi.

40     Under cross-examination, he stated that he did not interview Guok because he (Guok) chose to type his statement himself and forwarded it to him. He said that Guok made two statements. In the first statement, Guok stated that the ticket hit Vinoth on his face, but in his further statement he stated that it did not but fell on the floor in front of Vinoth. SSgt Nazir stated that the first statement was given in December 2016 and the further statement was given in March 2017. He stated that the further statement came about because he was directed in March 2017 to obtain a further statement from Guok. However, Guok had dated both statements as 7th December 2016 at 1800 hours and the conclusion date was also identical as 18 December 2016 at 1800 hours.

41     SSgt Nazir stated that he was certain from what he had minuted in the Investigation Paper that Guok had stated in the initial statement that the ticket hit Vinoth on his face but stated it did not in the March 2017 statement. SSgt Nazir said he wanted to clarify the discrepancy but Guok did not turn up or reply to his emails.

#### Evidence of PW7 – Irwanshah Bin Ramlan (‘Irwan’)

42     Irwan was a Certis CISCO officer and was attached to NEA. On 18 November 2016, he was involved in the anti-smoking operation at 7th Heaven KTV. His role was as an enforcement officer and his partner was Vinoth.

43     He stated that the KTV was dark and noisy and he lost sight of Vinoth. Later, he heard Vinoth shouting his name and waiving at him to come over to where he was. Vinoth was then about six meters away and was outside the toilet. As Irwan was approaching, he saw the accused holding a lighted cigarette in his hand. He said that Navin and Thambi were already at the area. He saw Vinoth showing his NEA pass. The accused then walked off to the balcony which was about two meters away.

44     Irwan went to the balcony with Vinoth. He said that Navin and Thambi also entered the balcony. The accused sat on a chair at the balcony. Vinoth again showed his NEA pass and he (Irwan) took out his CISCO card and told the accused that he is also from NEA. He heard Vinoth asking the accused for his identification card. However, the accused refused to produce it. He said that a friend of the accused (established to be Manjeet) also came into the balcony. He said that Manjeet also refused to produce his identification card. He said the accused uttered ‘motherfucker’ and made barking sounds. The accused then pretended to make a call using his handphone and said there are a lot of ‘dogs’ in front of him. Thereafter, the accused went back into the KTV.

45     He said that Vinoth, Navin and himself also went into the KTV. The accused sat down. He said the three of them were standing to the rear of the accused. He estimated that they were about one metre from the accused. The accused tried to splash liquid which was in a glass to his rear in their direction. He said the liquid did not hit him, but he was unable to recall if it splashed onto anyone.

46     When the police arrived, they brought the accused to the ground floor. He said the NEA officers also followed suit. He stated that the accused produced his identification card to the police officer who then handed it to Vinoth. After Vinoth issued the ticket, he passed it to the police officer. He said the accused took the ticket and tore it, he then put it in his mouth and tore it further with his teeth, and he threw the rest at Vinoth’s face. He said that the ticket landed on Vinoth’s face and fell to the ground. He was unable to recall the reaction of Vinoth. He explained that his attention was on the accused. Thereafter, the accused pointed his middle finger at Vinoth and walked off.

47     Under cross-examination, he said that he did not see Manjeet outside the toilet. He said that he only saw him entering the balcony after he (Irwan) had entered. He agreed that the first time there was a request for the accused’s identification was inside the balcony. As regards his evidence that the accused showed his middle finger, he was shown the footage from the body-worn camera which did not show the accused showing his middle finger immediately after he threw the ticket but did so outside the lift. Irwan stated that he would accept what the footage shows but said that his testimony was based on his recollection and he was in fact unable to recall that the accused had shown the middle finger again near the lift.

#### Evidence of PW8 – Nasruddin Bin Norhan (‘Nasruddin’)

48     Nasruddin was serving his National Service in the Singapore Police Force at the material time. He was a Neighbourhood Police Centre Officer at Ang Mo Kio South NPC. On 18 November 2016, he was on night shift patrol duty with Guok.

49     He confirmed that Guok and him were in the first patrol car which was dispatched to the scene. Upon arrival, they were led to the KTV by a Chinese NEA officer. They brought the accused and his friend (Manjeet) to the ground floor. The NEA officers also came down. At the ground floor, Guok obtained the identification card from the accused and handed it to an Indian NEA officer wearing a blue shirt. The NEA officer handed the ticket which he issued to Guok who in turn passed it to the accused. The accused took the ticket and tore it, he further tore a portion with his teeth, and crumpled and threw the remainder in an upward motion towards the direction of the Indian NEA officer. It was his evidence that only the NEA officers were standing in the direction at which the accused threw the ticket. He said that he did not see where the ticket landed as he was not looking at the Indian NEA officer then. He stated that the accused then scolded some vulgarities at the NEA officers and went up to the KTV.

50     Nasruddin testified that either the Indian NEA officer or another NEA officer informed Guok that the ticket hit the face of the Indian NEA officer. He said that Guok discussed with the second team of police officers that arrived, which included SI Jeremy, on the nature of the offence committed. Thereafter, Guok briefed the Investigation Officer and instructions were given to arrest the accused. Guok and Nasruddin then went up to the KTV and arrested the accused for using criminal force against a public servant and using vulgar language towards a public servant.

## Prima facie case

51     There was no submission of ‘no case’ made at the close of the prosecution’s case. I was satisfied that a prima facie case was made out and the accused was called upon to enter his defence. The two courses were explained. He elected to give evidence. He called two witnesses in his defence.

## The Case for the Defence

#### Evidence of Accused (DW1)

52     On 18 November 2016 at around 10pm, the accused went to the 7th Heaven KTV to meet his business partner, Manjeet. They ordered a jug of beer. About 20 minutes later, he went to the toilet. After he came out of the toilet, he lighted a cigarette with the intention to go to the balcony to smoke. He claimed that he understood the balcony was a smoking area. He explained that he lighted the cigarette at the area outside the toilet because the balcony is usually very windy.

53     He was stopped by a tall Indian man (Vinoth) as he was walking towards the balcony. Vinoth informed him that he is from NEA and told him he was not allowed to smoke in the KTV. He asked Vinoth for his pass but he refused to produce it. He said that Vinoth repeated that he was from NEA and he again asked him for his pass. However, he still did not produce it. He said three other Indian men and one Malay man had also joined them by then. However, they did not say anything.

54     He walked towards the balcony. Vinoth tried to stop him. Nevertheless, he proceeded to the balcony and sat down. He claimed that Vinoth and the four others entered the balcony. Shortly, three to four other persons entered. He said there were a total of seven to eight people. Vinoth shouted at him and asked for his NRIC. He asked him a few times to show his NEA pass in order for him to produce his NRIC. However, Vinoth refused to do so. He said he felt threatened and asked Vinoth to call the police.

55     He stated that Manjeet heard from a waitress that he was in trouble and came to the balcony. He told Manjeet what happened and that Vinoth was claiming to be from NEA but he had not shown his pass. He claimed that Manjeet also asked to see the pass but Vinoth did not produce it. He said that Manjeet then pulled him out of the balcony and they returned to their table in the KTV. He said three to four people who were at the balcony followed them into the KTV. They stood three to four meters away from his table and were staring at him.

56     About half an hour later, the police came and asked him and Manjeet to go to the ground floor. He cooperated with the police. He handed his NRIC to the police. Guok informed him that the NEA officer will be issuing a ticket to him for smoking. When he received it, he was frustrated and angry. He put it into his mouth and tore it with his teeth. He wanted to get rid of it and threw a portion of the torn ticket into the air ‘naturally’. He asserted that he did not aim it at anyone. He claimed that he was very surprised at the allegation that the ticket hit Vinoth. He said the NEA officers were about four meters from him when he threw it.

57     He admitted that he said ‘Dogs, bloody dogs’ and showed his middle finger to Vinoth near the lift thereafter. He said he was frustrated. He went back up to the KTV. About half an hour later, he was arrested.

58     Under cross-examination, he stated that Manjeet was also a smoker. He said that he (accused) was going to the toilet and therefore he did not ask Manjeet to join him for a smoke. He agreed that he put one cigarette behind his ear before he went to the toilet. He also admitted that he had the packet of cigarettes and lighter with him. He claimed that he did not put a cigarette in his mouth at the corridor outside the toilet and had only lighted it whilst holding onto it and put it in his mouth at the door to the balcony. He denied that he asked to be given a chance.

59     He was referred to his long statement recorded on 19 November 2016 at 5.48am (P11) in which he stated, “_The group then surrounded me. Only one of them showed me a pass quickly which is too fast for me to inspect and he told me that he is a NEA officer._” Asked to explain his evidence in court that he was not shown any pass, the accused initially stated that he missed this out and asserted that one person produced and placed it back in the pocket and it was ‘as good as they \[did not\] show me anything’. However, he then went on to say that the officer did not produce a pass but a notebook.

60     As regards his evidence that he threw the ticket in the air, he was referred to \[14\] of the Case for Defence (P15), in which he stated that he threw the ticket towards the floor. He was asked by the learned DPP[^3]:

Q

 | 

_“Leslie tore up the fine slip and threw the pieces towards the floor in front of him.”_ So, I’m just going to ask you why in this Case for Defence, you indicated that you threw the pieces towards the floor, but in Court you s---you now have something else to add, not only did you throw on the floor, you also threw some in the air.

| 

A

 | 

For this paragraph 14, the reason why I mentioned Vinoth is because from the beginning of the statement, all---every page you move, every fir---first page they mentioned, Vinoth, Vinoth, Vinoth I throw the paper, they claimed that I throw the paper onto Vinoth, I threw the paper onto Vinoth, that’s why I mentioned this name, this Vinoth. Actually---

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Listen---

 |
| 

A

 | 

I---I cannot recall that who is Vinoth.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

okay, listen, her---the thrust of her question is you stated at paragraph 14, “Threw the pieces towards the floor.” There’s no mention of you throwing in an upward motion in the air, as you have put it. So, why was it just simply stated you threw it towards the floor?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Because I got a difficulty to elaborate because when the first paper I throw, is throwing down. The oth---the other paper I just throw---just throw without thinking whether on the floor or---or on the air. I assumed is---my intention is to throw on the floor, whether the air or on the floor, I expect the paper is going to land on the floor, not to anybody. I got no intention to throw the piece of paper or going to hit anyone. Not to hit, I got no intention to hit anybody, not to hit anyone. That’s why I mentioned whether how I throw is the normal human reaction. Even though now you ask me to throw a piece of paper again, it can be in the---my hand it can be in the centre, it can be below my waist, it can be upper waist.

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

What are you referring to as---

 |
| 

A

 | 

If not now, you ask me to---

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Listen, what are you referring to as a normal human reaction?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Is just I---my intention is just throw, get rid of the summon, because I was very frustrated. I just throw, you---if you ask me that how I---uh---I’m---am I going to throw, I really can’t answer, is the normal throwing. I got no intention to aim at anyone.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Mr. Loh, this Case for the Defence was filed based on your instructions to your lawyer, so, what is so difficult having to tell them exactly how you threw the paper when you had the benefit of the BWC footage before you filed the c---the CFD?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I cannot---can you please repeat?

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

She said that you had already viewed the body worn footage sometime in July, this was filed in September. So, she’s saying why was it so difficult to put it into words that you had thrown part of it into the air?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

My---Your Honour, can you please repeat again, sorry---

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Sure.

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

I got a wo---small memory because---so sorry.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Okay, okay. You viewed the footage in July 2018. This was filed in September 2018. And just now you made reference to difficulty in putting it into words. But she’s saying that, you know, it would have been very easy for you to state that a part of the summons was thrown in the air, just like you’re telling us today. So, why didn’t you say all that in your Case for the Defence?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Because I already tried my best to recall what is happening on that night, the incident happened night. To see a statements---actually I got difficulty to see this---look at the statements. At many times, even though you ask me to see the footage for past 10 minutes, I can imme---maybe certain I’m---I can immediately or maybe short minutes I can for---forgot certain things. I have---I have to repeat, repeat, repeat and again, this my memory. So, certain thing I---I recall---I can recall, I will just mention, ah, what---what is happening on that night. This I really do my best to answering the Court questions that wa---what I can recall, I will just---what I can tell, I will just tell. What I can recall, I will just recall.

#### Evidence of DW2 – Manjeet Singh s/o Banta Singh (‘Manjeet’)

61     Manjeet has known the accused for four to five years. He has business dealings with him and they meet up when there is a need to discuss business.

62     On 18 November 2016 at around 10pm, he met the accused at the 7th Heaven KTV. He stated the accused went to the toilet in the course of the night and did not return to the table for quite some time. He estimated the duration to be about 15 minutes. He was told by a staff that the accused was having ‘some problem’ at the balcony. He proceeded there. He pushed open the door to enter. He saw the accused was sitting down and surrounded by seven to eight people. He said it was ‘a bit rowdy’ and he asked them what was going on. One of them answered ‘NEA’. He asked to see his pass. However, the person said ‘No’. He then asked the accused to go back into the KTV. He estimated that he was at the balcony for not more than two minutes.

63     He said that they sat at their table and continued to drink. He testified that the accused did not tell him anything else other than that the people claimed they were from NEA and refused to show their passes. He saw three or four people standing about three to four metres away from their table and staring at them. He claimed that these people were on his right and on the left of the accused who was seated opposite to him. He denied that the accused tried to splash liquid at them. He said they simply ignored them.

64     Subsequently, the police came. He said the accused was frustrated but he cooperated and went down with the police. He accompanied the accused. At the ground floor, he saw the accused handing his NRIC to the police officer. He saw the accused biting the ticket and ‘toss the paper down’ without looking at anyone. He said the accused threw the ticket towards his right and it landed on the floor in front of Guok. He claimed the accused was then about three to four meters away from the group of people who were behind Guok. He heard someone saying to charge the accused for littering. He and the accused then returned to the KTV. Subsequently, the accused was handcuffed by the police in the KTV.

65     Under cross-examination, Manjeet stated that he is a smoker. Asked if he had smoked on the day of the incident, he said he did before the accused’s encounter with the NEA officers. He stated that the accused did not say anything to him when he left the table.

#### Evidence of DW3 – Guok Joong Yin (‘Guok’)

66     Guok was a Senior Station Inspector with the Singapore Police Force. He retired in September 2017.

67     On 18 November 2016, he was dispatched by the Operations Room to 7th Heaven KTV together with Nasruddin. Upon arrival, he was briefed by a NEA officer that the accused had committed an offence of smoking inside the KTV and had refused to furnish his particulars. Guok went into the KTV and informed the accused of the complaint. He asked him to go down with him to the ground floor. The accused complied. Guok went down with the accused, Manjeet and the NEA officers.

68     At the ground floor, the accused handed his NRIC to him. Guok then handed the NRIC to the NEA officers. The accused was unhappy that his NRIC was handed to the NEA officers without his authority. The accused told him that he had only lighted the cigarette but did not smoke. Guok explained to the accused that he is required to hand his NRIC to the NEA officers.

69     The NEA officer proceeded to issue the ticket. Thereafter, the NRIC and ticket were passed to him (Guok) to hand over to the accused. Guok returned the NRIC to the accused and handed the ticket. He testified that the accused tore the ticket with his hands and teeth and threw the remainder in the direction of the NEA officers. Guok said he did not see if the ticket hit Vinoth as he was not facing him directly but standing sideways. However, he suspected that it might have. On further questioning, he agreed with learned counsel that the ticket did not hit the face of Vinoth. Asked if any NEA officer informed him that the ticket had hit a NEA officer on his face, he said that he was not informed. Guok said the accused was arrested for ‘intentional harassment’.

70     Under cross-examination, he stated that the accused did not raise any complaint to him that the NEA officers had not identified themselves by producing their passes. He said the accused was unhappy that he was alleged to have committed an offence of smoking as he claimed he had only lighted the cigarette. He agreed the accused was very unhappy that he handed his NRIC to the NEA officer.

71     He stated that the torn ticket was thrown in the direction of Vinoth’s face. He gave the following answers to the learned DPP’s questions[^4]:

> Q    So, am I right to say that what you saw on that day was the accused throwing the paper in the direction of the NEA officers and it landing on the floor in front of the NEA officer. So, what you saw was the start, the end, you didn’t see clearly at all if it hit Vinoth’s face before landing on the floor. Is that correct?

> A    Uh, correct, Ma’am.

> Q    So, when you told the Court at the last hearing that you yourself saw the paper never touched the NEA officer’s face, this was incorrect, correct?

> A    Yes, Ma’am.

72     He stated the distance between the accused and Vinoth was around 1½ meters. He said he was standing closer to the accused and his position did not block the throw of the ticket in the direction of Vinoth.

73     Guok agreed that the accused was placed in his patrol car and taken to the Ang Mo Kio Police Station. He agreed that in the course of the journey in the police car, he told the accused that it was wrong of him to have thrown the ‘summons’ at the face of the NEA officer. On 19th November 2016 at 12:51am, he lodged the arrest report (see P19). In the arrest report he stated, “_The subject torn the summon right in front of us, threw on Vinoth a/l Paramsivan fin: GXXXX345G Certis Cisco Centre 70 Jalan Afifi face_”. He agreed that he meant that the ticket hit the face. He agreed that the body-worn camera footage did not capture where the ticket landed because of the angle of the camera.

74     He was shown the body-worn footage, and he agreed that Vinoth informed him that the accused threw the ticket right onto his face. He agreed that Chew also told him that the accused threw the ticket onto Vinoth’s face. He agreed that Chew repeated that the accused threw the ticket onto his officer and asked him to take action.

75     He agreed that the back-up police officers arrived and one of them was SI Jeremy. He informed SI Jeremy that “I saw in front of him but not at the face.” He did not inform SI Jeremy what Vinoth and Chew had told him. He agreed that Vinoth informed SI Jeremy in his presence that the accused threw the ticket on his face.

76     He was referred to the statement which he made on 18 December 2016 (P17) in which he stated, _“The moment the subject received the summon he tore it into pieces and threw it on complainant’s face. A few pieces of the torn summon landed on complainant’s face and the rest landed on the floor.”_ He said that he made that statement because he suspected the ticket must have landed on Vinoth’s face. He claimed that he did not state his version ‘properly’ and check the statement. Subsequently, he was asked to give a further statement because he was told that the body-worn camera footage did not capture the ticket hitting Vinoth’s face and because he had informed SI Jeremy at the scene that the ticket did not hit Vinoth. He gave the second statement (exh P20) in March 2017. In the statement, he then stated “_The moment the subject received the summons he torn it into pieces and threw it towards the direction of complainant’s face. However, the torn summon did not land on complainant’s face and they dropped and landed on the floor right in front of complainant._”

77     In re-examination, he stated that the accused was arrested under s 6 of the Protection of Harassment Act and for using criminal force.

## Findings

78     The ingredients of the offence under s 353 Penal Code are:

> (a)     that Vinoth was a public servant;

> (b)     that the accused used criminal force towards him;

> (c)     that the accused used criminal force on Vinoth when he was in the execution of his duty as public servant.

79     Criminal force is defined in s 350 Penal Code. The prosecution must proof that the accused intentionally used force with the intention to cause injury, fear or annoyance or with the knowledge that it was likely to do so.

### Whether Vinoth showed his NEA pass?

80     The accused admitted that Vinoth identified himself as a NEA officer and alleged he had committed an offence of smoking in a prohibited place. He admitted that Vinoth asked for his NRIC. The accused claimed that he responded by asking Vinoth to show his pass a few times. However, Vinoth inexplicably did not do so. On the accused’s evidence, Vinoth did not say anything to his requests to show the pass but merely kept repeating he was from NEA.

81     If the accused was indeed uncertain of the identity of Vinoth and the group of men whom he felt were threatening and one of whom had allegedly used abusive language and some of them had also followed him into the KTV and stared at him, his natural instinct would have been to ask for police assistance as he had his handphone, or at the very least to have informed the staff of the KTV. He did neither of this. Further, he also did not inform Guok that he did not provide his particulars because Vinoth had not produced his pass. If that was indeed the reason, then it is reasonable to expect him to have explained that to Guok. Instead, he was agitated over the fact that he had been accused of smoking and his NRIC had been passed to the NEA officers. He defended himself by telling Guok that he lighted the cigarette ‘accidentally’ and was merely ‘holding’ the cigarette in his mouth and was not smoking at the corridor. Similarly, Manjeet also did not make any complaint to Guok that the NEA officers had not produced their pass. Instead, he also stated that they had not committed any offence and asked why they should produce their NRICs to the NEA officers.

82     In my view, the accused’s account that Vinoth refused to produce his pass is illogical and an afterthought. On Vinoth’s evidence, he showed the NEA pass to the bouncers to allow him to carry out his duty. It therefore made no sense for him to simply repeat he is from NEA and to refuse to show his NEA pass if the accused had made a request to verify his identity before he complied with the request to produce his NRIC.

83     I found that the accused did not mention to Guok that Vinoth did not show his pass because this claim was an afterthought. The fact that his claim is an afterthought is also supported by his statement (exh P11) which he made about six hours later. In P11, he stated that one of the officers produced his “pass quickly” which was “too fast” for him to inspect. Under cross-examination when confronted with the statement, he went onto give a third version that the officer had produced a notebook. This claim was never put to any of the officers. The differing accounts provided by the accused showed the utter lack of credibility of his claim that the NEA officers had refused to produce their NEA passes.

84     Navin testified that there was a briefing prior to the pub blitz operation during which the officers involved had to show their passes to the supervisors. This clearly showed that all officers had their passes before they left for the operation. It was the evidence of Navin, Irwan and Thambi that they saw Vinoth showing his NEA pass to the accused and Navin testified that he did likewise. I found no basis to doubt the reliability of Vinoth, Navin, Irwan and Thambi’s evidence.

85     I disbelieved the evidence of the accused that Vinoth did not show his pass. I found that the accused had asked Vinoth for a chance to be let off and he became uncooperative when Vinoth insisted on issuing the ticket and requested for his NRIC to do so. In the same vein, the accused became highly agitated when Guok passed his NRIC to the NEA officers. Guok had to appease him by telling him that he must provide his NRIC and that it was his (Guok) duty to do so as he had been called to attend to the matter. I found that the accused did not produce his NRIC to Vinoth because he was trying to frustrate the issuance of the ticket.

### Did the accused intentionally use criminal force?

86     The backdrop is that the accused was disputing that he had smoked and was frustrating the issuance of the ticket by not providing his particulars. From the footage, it is clear that he showed his middle finger and defiantly walked off before he had received the ticket and taken back his NRIC. It was not in dispute that the accused first tore the ticket with his hand and thereafter tore it further with his teeth. Some of the torn pieces dropped onto the floor. He then crumpled the remainder of the ticket. He claimed he did not aim it anyone but threw it in the air ‘naturally’ as he wanted to get it out of his hand.

#### Vinoth’s evidence

87     The defence attempted to discredit the evidence of Vinoth by claiming that he was 4 to 5 meters away as opposed to 1 to 2 meters and was standing behind Guok as opposed to almost face-to-face with the accused. It was submitted that due to the considerable distance and position of the accused, it was unlikely that the ticket could have hit him on the temple.

88     Vinoth’s evidence was that he was ‘quite close’ to the accused. He initially estimated the distance to be ‘\[i\]t’s like 1 meter away…’. Asked to demonstrate the approximate distance, he gauged the distance by pointing to an object which was about two meters away from him. He made no attempt to hide that the distance was slightly further than the one meter he had estimated. The distance of about two meters is consistent with his evidence that he was ‘quite close’ to the accused.

89     The reliability of Vinoth’s evidence is confirmed by the defence witness, Guok, who estimated that the distance between the accused and the NEA officers was 1½ meters.

90     With respect to the submission that the body-worn Footage A shows that Vinoth was behind SI Guok, Vinoth’s evidence was as follows[^5]:

> I was there and I know the summon paper was towards to me and hit my face. Maybe from this, uh, footage, the angle may be different and the---and as I---as I can---as I can say, I was in front of the subject and the subject saw me and throw. That’s it.

91     Guok confirmed that he was not blocking or in the way of Vinoth when the ticket was thrown. From my observation of the footage, I accepted Vinoth’s evidence that he was not behind Guok when the ticket was thrown.

92     Nasruddin stated that Vinoth informed Guok that the ticket hit his face. It is also clear from the footage that Vinoth had informed Guok and SI Jeremy that the ticket was thrown onto his face. He also pointed to his temple where the ticket landed.

### The other witnesses

93     The defence submitted that the evidence of Navin, Thambi and Irwan was suspiciously unclear in recollecting the same pertinent details surrounding the incident such as where exactly they stood in relation to Vinoth; where on Vinoth’s face did the ticket hit; and Vinoth’s reaction to allegedly being hit in the face by the torn ticket.

#### Thambi’s evidence

94     Thambi stated clearly that the accused was facing Vinoth and he demonstrated their distance to be about 1.5m apart. His evidence on his own position was that he was to the right of Vinoth but at his rear. He stated that he saw, in his words, the ‘hand flow’ of the accused when he threw the ticket; that it was thrown straight at Vinoth; that the ticket did not drop directly onto the floor before it reached Vinoth; that it did so only after contacting Vinoth’s face; that it thereafter dropped in front of Vinoth. His evidence is summed up in his words as follows[^6]:

> So, that’s why I was behind of Vinoth, I couldn’t see exactly which part of the face but I know it hit on his face.

In my assessment, there is no reliable basis to doubt his evidence.

#### Chew’s evidence

95     Chew was one of the two supervisors for the operation. He estimated that he was about 5 metres away from the accused. He stated that the accused was opposite Vinoth and he demonstrated the distance between them to be about one metre apart. He stated categorically that he saw the ticket hit Vinoth on his face. He was the most articulate amongst the group of officers and he gave cogent evidence as to why he was unable to state on which part of the face the ticket made contact. His evidence was as follows[^7]:

> Q    … Okay. What---which part of Vinoth did it land?

> A    On Vinoth’s face, but if you’re going to ask me exactly where, I can’t tell you. It’s maybe on the forehead, the eyes, or the cheek. Somewhere here.

> Q    You can’t tell because you can’t remember exactly, or you---

> A    Well, because the action is so fast when you throw something, right. You can see that the thing landed somewhere but exact the---exactly where the thing landed, the exact spot, I don’t think many people can tell you where.

> Q    I see.

> A    Because the action is not---

> Q    Okay. And you---did you observe the action of the subject when he throw the paper?

> A    Yes.

> Q    Okay. In your mind and in your opinion, do you think he was doing intentionally? Could it be that he wasn’t aiming, but the paper just landed on Vinoth?

> A    No, I don’t think so.

96     I found his evidence that he was able to see the ticket contacting the face but he was not able to discern the exact spot to be candid and reliable. It is also significant that he informed Guok twice at the scene that the ticket was thrown onto his officer.

#### Irwan’s evidence

97     Irwan’s evidence was that the ticket landed on Vinoth’s face. The defence criticised his evidence on the ground that he was unable to recount the reaction of Vinoth when the ticket landed on Vinoth’s face and that he inaccurately recalled that the accused pointed the middle finger immediately after he threw the torn ticket.

98     Irwan explained that he was testifying as to what he could remember. I found that he was mistaken that the accused immediately showed his middle finger after throwing the ticket at Vinoth. It is significant to note that Irwan’s recollection was not entirely without basis. From the footage, it is clear the accused had just moments before he was handed the ticket showed the middle finger. So, quite clearly the accused did not show the middle finger only at the lift. In fact, Irwan testified that he was unable to recollect that the accused had shown the middle finger again at the lift until he watched the footage.

99     I found that Irwan had made a genuine mistake in recollecting the sequence of when the middle finger was shown due to the passage of time. I found that this did not discredit his evidence.

#### Navin’s evidence

100    Navin did not know Vinoth before he was attached to NEA. He also had no contact with him after he was posted out from NEA. There is absolutely no reason for Navin to give a false account to back-up Vinoth’s account. The incident happened about two years ago. It is therefore unsurprising that he could only recall the most significant events, one of which was that the ticket had hit Vinoth on the face.

101    As regards his evidence that the accused had pulled the ticket from Guok’s hands, he explained that he gave such evidence because the process of explaining the mode of payment was not completed. I accepted his explanation.

#### Accused’s evidence

102    I found the evidence of the accused to be unworthy of belief. I rejected his evidence that he was holding the cigarette in his hand and did not put it in his mouth at the corridor outside the toilet. His evidence was not only contradicted by the overwhelming evidence of the NEA officers who saw the cigarette in his mouth but also contrary to his admission at the scene to Guok that the cigarette was in his mouth. He said to Guok, “_No, I tell you, I was really just holding it in my mouth and was walking out._” (pg 8 of P10T). In the Case for the Defence (P15) at \[4\], it was also stated that the cigarette was in the accused’s mouth.

103    His evidence on whether the cigarette was lighted went through several permutations from lighted to unlit to half-lighted. These changes showed the lack of credibility of the accused.

104    I found his evidence that he did not furnish his particulars because Vinoth did not show his NEA pass to him to be a lie to justify his blatant refusal to comply. The fact that he wilfully did not want to furnish his particulars to Vinoth for the issuance of the ticket is supported by the fact that he told Guok ‘_Summon what, I don’t let them summon at all_’ and ‘_but you cannot give them my particulars_’ (see pg 9 of transcript P10T).

105    I rejected his evidence that he did not know where Vinoth was standing and did not see Guok handing his NRIC to Vinoth. I found that he claimed that he did not see his NRIC being handed to Vinoth in order to maintain that he did not intentionally throw the ticket at him. The footage shows the accused had shown his middle finger in the direction of where the NEA officers were standing and walked off before he was returned his NRIC and handed the ticket. He admitted that he was angry. He had crumpled the ticket in order to throw it; he threw it in a forward and upward direction; he uttered the words ‘Dog, this one dog ah, dog’ before he threw it. I found that the words were directed at Vinoth whom he was facing and that he had intentionally thrown the crumpled ticket at Vinoth. I rejected his evidence that he was 4 to 5 metres from the group of people who were behind Guok when he threw the ticket. The overwhelming evidence, including that of Guok, was that the accused was not more than 2 meters away from Vinoth and he was facing Vinoth directly.

#### Manjeet’s evidence

106    Manjeet’s evidence that the accused left for the toilet whilst he remained at the table and that he was sitting alone for about 15 minutes when he was told that the accused is ‘in trouble’ was contradicted by his statement which he gave to the police on 30 January 2018 (P16). In his statement, he said that he went to the toilet and was unable to find the accused after he came out. Asked to explain the discrepancy, he stuck to his version of events and merely said he was unable to recall he went to the toilet “at that time”.

107    As regards his testimony that he asked the person who told him he was from NEA to show his pass and he refused to do so, he conceded that this was not stated in his police statement. Asked to explain why, he merely answered “I don’t know.” He also did not complain to Guok that the NEA officer had not produced his pass. Instead, his stance (similar to that of the accused) was that they should not be asked to produce their NRICs because they had committed any offence.

108    His evidence that the accused did not bother to look when he threw the ticket in frustration; that the accused had no intention to throw at anyone; that the crumpled ticket landed in front of Guok; that the accused threw it to his right; that the group of NEA officers were three to four metres behind are also missing from his statement. Instead, he stated “_I cannot remember if he had threw the summon._” Asked to explain why he was unable to recount the details in his police statement, he answered, “_Yes, you showed me the video_.” When it was pointed out that he had given his detailed version before he was shown the footage, he answered, “_No, not true_.” This was blatantly false as the footage was shown to him only after he had provided his version of the events. Subsequently, Manjeet conceded that he gave his evidence that the accused threw the ticket on the floor before the footage was shown to him. Asked if he was able to recall that the accused threw the ticket without watching the footage, he then claimed that he had recollected the incident about one week before he gave his evidence and said that “it came into my mind” that the accused had “just tossed the paper”. Asked again to explain the contents of his statement, he replied, “_I just went through briefly with them and everything and what I could recollect at that time is what I told them_.” Asked to explain how he was able to now recall that the accused threw the ticket down in frustration, he replied that the video “really bring back a flashback to what exactly has happened”.

109    I found Manjeet’s evidence that Guok was in the way of Vinoth who was three to four meters behind and that the ticket dropped in front of Guok to be blatantly false. In fact, his evidence that ticket landed in front of Guok was not supported by the evidence of Guok.

110    Manjeet was also very defensive when he was asked about the use of abusive language by the accused. He averred that he did not think that the accused was directing it anyone and it ‘was just like a figure of speech’.

111    In the upshot, I found Manjeet to be a biased witness who had provided an unreliable version of events in order to assist the accused to avoid a conviction.

#### Guok’s evidence

112    The evidence of Guok was unhelpful to the defence. His evidence instead confirmed key details of the evidence of the prosecution’s witnesses in relation to the relative position of the accused and Vinoth and the direction in which the ticket was thrown.

113    Accordingly, I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused intentionally used criminal force against Vinoth with the intent to cause annoyance.

### In the execution of duty

114    Vinoth was on duty at the material time. He went to the premises to carry out an enforcement operation relating to smoking. He had just issued the ticket against the accused prior to the use of the criminal force. Accordingly, there can be no doubt that the criminal force was used when Vinoth was acting in the discharge of his duty.

### Section 95 of the Penal Code

115    Section 95 of the Penal Code reads:

> Nothing is an offence by reason that it causes, or that it is intended to cause, or that is known to be likely to cause, any harm, if that harm is so slight that no person of ordinary sense and temper would complain of such harm.

116    In _Teo Geok Fong v Lim Eng Hock_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 2 SLR(R) 957</span>, it was held that s 95 ‘provides relief to an offender where the act is negligible or the offence is of a trivial character.’ It was stated that the section would apply provided ‘the harm is so slight that no person of ordinary sense and temper would complain of such harm.’

117    The question is whether, having regard to the circumstances, the harm caused to Vinoth was so slight that no person of ordinary sense and temper would complain of such harm. In _Veeda Menezes v Yusuf Khan_ AIR 1966 SC 1773 (‘_Veeda Menezes_’), the Indian Supreme Court stated the factors to be considered as follows:

> The section is intended to prevent penalisation of negligible wrongs or of offences of trivial character. Whether an act which amounts to an offence is trivial would depend upon the nature of the injury, the position of the parties, the knowledge or intention with which the offending act is done, and the related circumstances. There can be no absolute standard or degree of harm which may be regarded as so slight that a person of ordinary sense and temper would not complain of the harm. It cannot be judged solely by the measure of physical or other injury the act causes.

118    As stated in _Veeda Menezes_, the question cannot be ‘judged solely by the measure of physical or other injury the act causes.’ The circumstances which led to the commission of the offence and the position of the parties must be considered. In the present case, the context of the offending was against an enforcement officer who was acting in the course of his duty. He had issued a ticket against the accused for having committed an offence. The accused was aggrieved at the accusation. He showed his disdain by tearing and throwing the ticket at the face. Such an act cannot be considered trivial and go unpunished. Enforcement officers perform a difficult public duty in enforcing the law and deserve protection from the courts. The accused cannot be allowed to act with impunity for using criminal force on an enforcement officer who was acting in the discharge of his public duty. Accordingly, I found that s 95 was inapplicable.

## Antecedents

119    In 1993, the accused was convicted of an offence of causing hurt under s 323 r/w s 34 Penal Code (Cap 224). He was fined $800. In 1996, he was convicted of an offence of affray. Another charge of attempted theft under s 379 r/w 511 Penal Code was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentence. He was sentenced to one week’s imprisonment. In 2020, he was convicted of drink driving and sentenced to a fine of $2,000 and with a disqualification order from driving for 12 months.

## Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

120    The prosecution submitted for a term of one week’s imprisonment. The prosecution referred to the framework in _Aw Soy Tee v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 114</span> (‘_Aw Soy Tee_’) and accepted that the offence fell within the low harm and low culpability range. It was highlighted that the judgment stated the indicative starting point for the range to be a short custodial term which was to be departed when there were exceptional factors.

121    It was submitted that there are no exceptional factors. The accused was blatantly uncooperative with the NEA officers. He had displayed contempt towards the authority of the NEA officers by tearing the ticket and throwing it at the officer who issued it. He had also shown his middle finger and hurled vulgarities. The prosecution also highlighted that the accused did not have a prior clean record.

## Mitigation

122    The accused is 50 years old. He is a real estate consultant. He also holds shares in a minimart franchise. He is divorced and lives with his 86-year-old mother who suffers from a multitude of medical conditions and mobility problems. He is her sole caregiver and financially provides for her. The accused suffers from a prolonged slipped disc condition.

123    He makes monetary donations to Chinese and Sikh temples. He also volunteers his time to distribute food rations to orphanages and elderly-care homes which the Chinese temples support, and to the Canossaville Children and Community Services. He is a regular volunteer at local community GRC events.

124    It was said the accused’s act was a ‘visceral’ reaction to a ‘highly stressful situation’. It was claimed the act was ‘entirely impulse-driven and a lapse in control over his frustration and anxiety at the situation’. It was said that no harm was caused to Vinoth as ‘any contact’ was ‘transient as the torn piece of paper landed on the floor in front of Vinoth almost immediately after the accused threw it’. It was highlighted that Vinoth described it as "_it's not a force, just lightly_".

125    The incident was said to be completely out of character for the accused. It was submitted that the accused is a ‘highly principled man’ and has always held persons with official authority to a high regard. It was claimed that this was evident from the manner in which the accused cooperated with the policemen at the scene and ‘promptly’ handed over his NRIC to them when requested to do so.

126    It was submitted that the accused is unlikely to reoffend. As regards the antecedent of affray in 1996, it was said that it was dated as the offence took place some 20 years ago. It was submitted that the antecedent was dissimilar and it was a squabble between the accused and his friend.

127    It was highlighted that if the accused is sentenced to a term of imprisonment, it is likely that his Real Estate licence will be revoked and he will lose a substantial source of income.

128    Learned counsel accepted that the relevant sentencing consideration is general deterrence. He stated the deterrence must be ‘tampered by the nature of the offence involved, the culpability of the accused and the actual or potential harm or damage done to society’. He referred to the decision in _Aw Soy Tee_ and submitted that based on the framework, the appropriate sentence should be a fine as the offence was on ‘the lowest end of the lesser-harm and lower culpability spectrum.’ It was submitted that there was ‘no physical interaction’ between the accused and Vinoth, that a single torn piece of paper was thrown, that it did not have the ‘capacity to do any harm’, Vinoth did not suffer any injury and had described the force to be light, and there were ‘very few’, if any, members of the public around.

## Sentence

129    The offence under s 353 carries an imprisonment term of up to four years or a fine or both.

130    The presumptive sentencing ranges which apply to first-time offenders who claim trial as set out in _Aw Soy Tee_ are as follows.

131    There is no dispute that the offence falls within category 1 of ‘lesser harm and lower culpability’. The majority of cases in Category 1 are stated in the judgment to comprise cases where ‘\[g\]enerally, the victim has not suffered bodily pain or injury as a consequence of the offender’s acts.’ (at \[41\]) At \[46\], it is stated that ‘fines should generally only be imposed in exceptional cases which lie at the lowest end of the low-harm, low-culpability spectrum for a s 353 offence’. At \[72\], the judgment elaborated that exceptional cases where fines were imposed were ‘cases where the harm suffered by the victim is extremely trivial, and where the accused’s culpability has been attenuated to a very significant extent’.

132    In terms of harm, I agreed that the present case was less serious than those cases which involved the use of criminal force by a direct physical act, example, a push. In such cases of a direct physical act, the typical sentencing range is between three to five weeks’ imprisonment. Accordingly, the sentence in the present case was calibrated to be lower than that imposed in those cases. As regards _Chua Cheng Hong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 158</span> which was cited by the defence, the offender was caught littering and had on the spur of the moment pushed an Auxiliary Police Officer who was in plain clothes on the chest when she was preventing him from leaving the scene. He was sentenced to three weeks’ imprisonment. On appeal, the imprisonment term was reduced to seven days’ presumably because the offender was 20 years old when he committed the offence and had acted spontaneously.

133    Like the majority of cases in Category 1, the fact that the force was minimal and there is no assertion of pain or hurt by itself is insufficient to warrant the imposition of a fine. The accused had been caught committing an offence of smoking within the KTV. When his request to be given a chance was not acceded to, he refused to provide his particulars and showed scant respect for the authority of the NEA officers. Whilst the crumpled ticket did not have the potential of causing physical injury, the act of throwing it at Vinoth’s face was intended to gratuitously humiliate and undermine his authority as a NEA officer. I therefore did not agree that the harm was trivial.

134    As regards culpability, the entire circumstances must be looked at which started with his deliberate defiance to provide his particulars. After the police assistance was sought to obtain his particulars, the accused had shown his middle finger towards the NEA officers before walking off without retrieving his NRIC and receiving the ticket. When he was called to collect his NRIC and handed the ticket, he demonstrated his defiance by tearing the ticket. He did not only use his hands but showed his contempt by putting it in his mouth and tearing it with his teeth. He called Vinoth a ‘dog’ before he threw the ticket at him. Thereafter, he continued with his defiant behaviour. The entire circumstances showed that the act of tearing and throwing the crumpled ticket at Vinoth was not spontaneous but a continuation of his complete disrespect and lack of regard for the authority of the NEA officers. I found that there were absolutely no circumstances to attenuate culpability.

135    As regards the timing and location of the offence, I regarded it as a neutral factor. It occurred at the ground floor of The Grassroots’ Club at about 11.32pm. As seen from the body-worn footage, there were members of the public at the entrance and a few were coming in and leaving. As stated in _Aw Soy Tee_, the absence of public quiet is a neutral factor and ‘does not, in and of itself, justify a non-custodial term’ (at \[66\]).

136    I did not place any weightage on the accused’s charitable contributions and volunteer work (see _Public Prosecutor v Lim Cheng Ji Alvin_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 671</span> at \[23\]-\]24\]). I would mention that the accused did not have a prior clean record although his antecedents were fairly dated. The fact that he may lose his Real Estate licence if he is sentenced to a term of imprisonment is irrelevant to sentence as he must expect to face the consequences under the criminal law (_Stansilas Fabian Kester v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 755</span> at \[111\]).

137    There is a need to protect enforcement officers in order for them to carry out their duties. The relevant sentencing objective is general deterrence. This is plainly not an exceptional case. I was firmly of the view that the custodial threshold had been crossed and sentenced the accused to one week’s imprisonment.
