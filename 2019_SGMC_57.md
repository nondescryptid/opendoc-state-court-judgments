Assessment of Damages – Loss of Earning Capacity – Single Joint Expert

12 September 2019

### Deputy Registrar Kevin Kwek:

## A.    Introduction

1       The plaintiff sustained injuries arising from a road traffic accident that occurred on 24 January 2017. Consent interlocutory judgment was entered on 7 May 2018 at 70% in favour of the plaintiff with damages to be assessed.

2       The assessment of damages hearing took place on 22 July 2019 (the “**_Assessment Hearing_**”).

3       The single joint expert, as agreed between the parties under O108 Rule 5 of the Rules of Court was Dr. Adrian Lau, an orthopaedic consultant at Changi General Hospital. Dr. Lau had reviewed the plaintiff post-accident and prepared three medical reports dated 28 November 2017, 31 January 2018 and 27 February 2018. After the plaintiff was released from the stand, both counsel informed the Court that the parties accepted the contents of Dr. Lau’s medical reports and dispensed with his attendance at the Assessment Hearing. In the circumstances, the only witness called at the Assessment Hearing was the plaintiff.

## B.    Agreed and Disputed Heads of Claim

4       Parties agreed on several heads of claim as set out in **_Annexure A_**. The assessment therefore focused on the remaining 4 disputed heads of claim, namely:

> (a)     undisplaced fracture of the distal phalanx of the right ring finger;

> (b)     multiple abrasions;

> (c)     loss of earning capacity; and

> (d)     future medical expenses.

5       The grounds for the award for each head of claim are set out below.

## C.    Undisplaced Fracture of the Distal Phalanx of the Right Ring Finger

6       The plaintiff sustained an undisplaced fracture of the distal phalanx of the right ring finger and was given 28 days of medical leave after the accident. According to Dr. Lau’s medical report of 28 November 2017, the plaintiff was treated with a mallet splint applied to both the right ring and little fingers. A radiograph of the right ring finger on 17 April 2017 showed that the fracture had healed. Dr. Lau opined that the plaintiff would experience a reduced range of motion to his right ring and little fingers and that it would likely be permanent. Further, Dr. Lau was of the view that the reduced range of motion may affect the plaintiff’s ability to grip tools.

7       Under the _Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases_, 2010 Edition (“**_Guidelines_**”) at 38, a serious injury to the ring or middle fingers resulting in substantial loss of function on a long-term basis attracts a compensation sum of $8,500 (“**_Serious Finger Injury Category_**”). This sum in the _Guidelines_ is derived from the unreported case in DC 50073 of 1999 of _Ramlan bin Mahat v. Prower Tech Boiler Engineering Pte Ltd (“_**_Ramlan_**_”)_, a case summary of which can be found in the _Practitioner’s Library: Assessment of Damages: Personal Injuries and Fatal Accidents_, 2017 Edition (“**_Practitioner’s Library_**”) at 339. The case summary indicates that the plaintiff had sustained **_a crushed right ring finger_** which resulted in **_one and half phalanges of the finger being amputated_**. The plaintiff in _Ramlan_ thereafter suffered difficulties in holding and gripping objects. The parties in _Ramlan_ **_agreed_** to an award of $8,500.

8       Below the Serious Finger Injury Category is the “amputation of terminal phalanx of ring/middle finger” category which attracts a compensation sum of $4,000 to $5,500 under the _Guidelines_.

9       In the present case, while there was no amputation of the finger, Dr. Lau had opined that the plaintiff would experience a reduced range of motion to his right ring and little fingers and that it would likely be permanent. Taking into account the _Guidelines_ and the time it took for plaintiff’s injury to heal (as well as the number of days the plaintiff was on medical leave), an award of $4,000 would be reasonable. The plaintiff’s injury was significantly less severe than that suffered by the plaintiff in _Ramlan_. There was also no amputation of the finger in the present case and only conservative treatment was administered.

10     The plaintiff relied on the case summary of _Murugiadas a/l Aramugam_ in MC Suit No. 6954 of 2000 (“**_Murugiadas_**”) which is found in the _Practitioner’s Library_ at 391 to support his claim of $13,000. In _Murugiadas_, a sum of $13,000 was awarded to the plaintiff after he had suffered fractures at the little, ring and middle fingers which required an open reduction and internal fixation of the fingers as well as physiotherapy. It was found in that case that subsequent surgery would also be needed to remove the implants and to improve the plaintiff’s range of motion. In the present case, only the plaintiff’s right ring finger was fractured and conservative treatment was administered. It is clear that the plaintiff’s injuries in this case are substantially less severe than those sustained by the plaintiff in _Murugiadas_.

11     On the other hand, the defendant’s submission of $2,000 is slightly on the low end for the reasons set out above. A sum of $4,000 is awarded for this head of claim.

## D.    Multiple Abrasions

12     Both parties accepted the contents of Dr. Lau’s medical reports. In this regard, Dr. Lau had written in his medical report of 27 February 2018 that the plaintiff had sustained abrasions over the palmar aspect of his right hand, the dorsal aspect of his right forearm as well as abrasions over his right knee. Apart from abrasions in these three areas, it was also likely that the plaintiff had sustained an abrasion over his middle finger based on the medical report of Dr. James Wong, the general practitioner who had attended to the plaintiff on the day of the accident.

13     The plaintiff submitted that $5,000 should be awarded under this head of claim while the defendant submitted that $1,500 would be an adequate sum.

14     Under the _Guidelines_ at 60, the range for an award for multiple abrasions would be between $500 to $3,000. An award in the higher range is appropriate where the multiple abrasions are large abrasions which result in scars that are not likely to fade away in the long run or despite cosmetic surgery.

15     The plaintiff relied on the case summary of _Tan Ming Chieh_ in DC 3731 of 2010 found in the _Practitioner’s Library_ at 874. According to the case summary, an award of $5,000 was granted to the plaintiff in that case for abrasions over the right hand dorsum, left forearm, left hand dorsum, nose bridge, right shoulder and right knee.

16     The present injuries suffered by the plaintiff are distinguishable from _Tan Ming Chieh_. First, the abrasions in _Tan Ming Chieh_ were far more extensive than in the present case. Second, the plaintiff in _Tan Ming Chieh_ suffered an abrasion to the **_nose bridge_**, which is located at a highly visible part of the body (i.e. the face). This would naturally attract a higher compensation.

17     For the above reasons, _Tan Ming Chieh_ is of limited assistance to the plaintiff in this case. Taking into consideration the number of abrasions sustained by the plaintiff, I find that $2,000 is a fair sum to award in this case. It is noted that there was no evidence that these abrasions were of significant size or that there was consequent scarring which would have attracted a higher compensation sum.

## E.    Loss of Earning Capacity (“LEC”)

18     The plaintiff was 41 years old at the date of the accident and 43 years old at the date of the Assessment Hearing. The plaintiff has been employed as an aircraft technician at Singapore Airlines Engineering Company Limited (“**SAEC**”) since 1 August 1997. As at the date of the Assessment Hearing, the plaintiff was still under the employ of SAEC. The plaintiff’s job scope included headset duties for aircraft towing as well as aircraft defects rectification.[^1] The plaintiff’s evidence was that this involved the changing of aircraft wheels which required him to use his hands frequently, especially his fingers. The plaintiff also testified that he had to carry relatively heavy items like aircraft chocks and his toolkit. According to the plaintiff, the injury to his right hand severely affected his ability and capacity to perform his primary duties of work.

19     Dr. Lim’s findings, as set out in his medical reports,[^2] are as follows.

> (a)     The plaintiff had sustained mallet deformity right little finger and an undisplaced fracture of the distal phalanx of his right finger.

> (b)     The radiograph of his right ring finger on 17 April 2017 revealed that his right ring finger distal phalanx fracture had healed.

> (c)     The plaintiff was able to return to work as an aircraft technician.

> (d)     The plaintiff’s right little finger distal interphalangeal joint had a range of motion of 0 to 40 degrees and his right ring finger had a range of motion of 0 to 50 degrees.

> (e)     The reduced range of motion may result in plaintiff having problems gripping.

> (f)     The reduced range of motion was likely permanent.

> (g)     An award of 3% permanent incapacity was recommended based on the “Guide to the Assessment of Traumatic Injuries and Occupational Diseases for Work Injury Compensation” (“**_WICA Guide_**”).

20     As mentioned above, both parties informed the Court that they accepted the single joint expert’s evidence and dispensed with his attendance at the Assessment Hearing.

## The Law on LEC

21     It is trite law that an award for LEC may be made where at the time of assessment, the plaintiff is in employment and has suffered no loss of earnings, but there is a risk that he may lose that employment at some time in the future and may then, as a result of his injury, be at a disadvantage in getting another job or an equally well paid job (_Teo Sing Keng and Anor v. Sim Ban Kiat_ <span class="citation">\[1994\] 1 SLR(R) 340</span>).

22     In _Chai Kang Wei Samuel v. Shaw Linda Gillian_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 3 SLR 587</span> (“**_Samuel Chai_**”), the Singapore Court of Appeal held that an award for LEC can only be made if there is a **_substantial or real risk_** that the plaintiff would lose his present job at some time before the estimated end of his working life **_and_** that the plaintiff will, because of the injuries, be at a disadvantage in the open employment market. This is a cumulative test.

## Decision on LEC

23     I dismiss the plaintiff’s claim for LEC. The plaintiff has not, on the balance of probabilities, satisfied both limbs of the _Samuel Chai_ test. This is elaborated below.

> (a)     The plaintiff has been a long-term employee of SAEC since August 1997. After the accident in January 2017, he returned to work in the same company with the same designation as before the accident. The plaintiff’s payslips showed an increase in his salary from December 2016 to January 2017. The plaintiff explained on the stand that this increase was due to a “13th month bonus” and “holiday pay”[^3]. Curiously, the plaintiff did not adduce any evidence of his salary post-accident (i.e. after February 2017). What was evident and conceded by the plaintiff was that there was no reduction in his salary post-accident.[^4] It was apparent that the plaintiff continued to be a valued member of SAEC even after the accident.

> (b)     The plaintiff did not adduce any evidence to show that he was at risk of losing his job. The letters from SAEC dated 7 and 20 June 2018 exhibited in the plaintiff’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief merely stated his job scope and length of employment at SAEC. There was no evidence that SAEC was dissatisfied with the plaintiff’s performance post-accident. The plaintiff’s belief that he might lose his job stemmed from his fear that SAEC might employ contract staff whose salaries would be much lower than his[^5]. No evidence was tendered to substantiate this, nor did the plaintiff call a representative from SAEC to give evidence in this regard.

> (c)     At the Assessment Hearing on 22 July 2019, while the plaintiff was unsure how the injury would affect him in the future, he acknowledged that his injury “\[did\] not affect my job now”[^6].

> (d)     While Dr. Lau opined that the plaintiff’s reduced range of motion of this right ring and little finger **_may_** affect (as opposed to **_will_** affect) the plaintiff’s ability to grip tools, he did not state that the plaintiff’s ability to work would be affected.

> (e)     Although Dr. Lau’s medical report dated 27 February 2018 stated that the plaintiff had sustained “3% permanent disability”, this assessment was based on the _WICA Guide_ which is a guide published by the Ministry of Manpower used for the purposes of assessing work injury compensation under the Work Injury Compensation Act.[^7] It was of limited assistance to the plaintiff insofar as it was being used to support the plaintiff’s claim that there was real risk that he would lose his present job as an aircraft technician at some time before the estimated end of his working life. In any event, it is noted that Dr. Lau’s evidence was that the plaintiff “is able to return to work as an aircraft technician”[^8].

> (f)     Apart from the Plaintiff’s failure to show that there was a real or substantial risk of the plaintiff losing his current job, there was also no credible evidence before this Court that the plaintiff would be disadvantaged in obtaining a similar job with similar remuneration.

24     As mentioned above, both parties had agreed to dispense with the cross-examination of Dr. Lau and accepted his findings as stated in his medical reports. However, in his written submissions, the plaintiff argued that “\[Dr. Lau\]’s medical report merely states that the \[p\]laintiff is able to return to work, however it does not comment on whether or not he would have difficulties at work.”[^9] Further, the plaintiff took issue with the fact that “the \[d\]efendant deliberately chose not to cross-examine Dr. Adrian Lau to seek further clarification on the intended meaning and scope of his report”. [^10]

25     Having decided to dispense with the cross-examination of Dr. Lau, it was rather peculiar for the plaintiff to then subsequently raise issues on parts of Dr. Lau’s medical reports that the plaintiff found to be unclear. With respect, this was tenuous argument given that the **_burden lies with the plaintiff_** to prove that there is a real risk that the plaintiff would lose his present job at some time before the estimated end of his working life and that the plaintiff will, because of the injuries, be at a disadvantage in the open employment market. As the parties’ expert, **_the single joint expert was open to cross-examination by both parties as of right_** (_Lee Song Yam v. Hafizah binte Abdul Rahman_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGMC 24</span> at \[24\]). If the plaintiff was of the view that Dr. Lau’s medical reports required further clarification, it was open to **_the plaintiff_** to seek that clarification by way of cross-examination. Given that both parties had agreed to dispense with cross-examining Dr. Lau, the Court can only assess the merits of the parties’ cases based on the evidence presented.

26     In summary, the plaintiff has not proven that there is a substantial or real risk that the plaintiff would lose his present job at some time before the estimated end of his working life and that the plaintiff will, because of the injuries, be at a disadvantage in the open employment market. Accordingly, the claim for LEC is dismissed.

## F.    Future Medical Expenses

27     The plaintiff claims for future medical expenses of $5,000. According to the plaintiff, this is the “rough estimation of the costs of the traditional massages” that the plaintiff intends to go for over a span of 4 years.[^11] During his oral testimony, the plaintiff explained that he would go for massages for his hands and body when he felt pain. He described this as a “traditional way” of treatment.

28     I agree with the Defendant that no award should be made for this head of claim.

29     The Court must be satisfied that future medical expenses will be incurred before granting them.[^12] To assist in the assessment, the Court generally requires proof that such treatments are necessary in the future. No award should be made in this case for the following reasons.

30     First, and most crucially, none of the medical reports in evidence stated that the plaintiff required future medical treatment, a point conceded by the plaintiff during cross-examination.[^13]

31     Second, while the plaintiff testified that he had to go for pressure massages every now and then, no invoices or receipts were tendered in evidence. Based on the most recent medical invoice before the Court, the plaintiff’s last medical treatment was at Changi General Hospital on 29 May 2017[^14], which was more than 2 years ago.

32     Save for the bare assertions made by the plaintiff that he requires massages, no cogent evidence of the likely duration, extent and necessity of such treatment was placed before this Court. Accordingly, no award is made for future medical expenses.

## G.    Conclusion

33     For the reasons above, final judgment is entered whereby the defendant shall pay the plaintiff general damages of $6,300 and special damages of $265.38. The figures are on a 70% basis.

34     I will hear parties on interest and costs.
