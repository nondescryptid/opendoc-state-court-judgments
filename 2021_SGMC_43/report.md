### District Judge Kessler Soh:

## Introduction

1       The Productivity and Innovation Credit (“**PIC**”) scheme was a government subsidy scheme to boost the productivity of local businesses and stimulate the local economy. It was administered by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (“**IRAS**”). To qualify under the scheme, the claimant had to have _an active business entity_ with at least _three local employees_ and have made _qualifying expenditure_. An application form (the “**PIC form**”) had to be submitted to IRAS with the necessary particulars to support the claim, and a declaration by the claimant that the information provided was true.

2       Mr S Chandran, a Singaporean aged 40 years, was the sole proprietor of a business known as Paradize Consultancy (“**PC**”). In 2014, he contacted and encouraged various individuals to file PIC claims. He, and his staff at PC, advised and assisted them to submit the claims. The individuals did not meet the conditions and were ineligible to make a PIC claim. Yet their PIC forms contained false statements that they had an active business entity with three local employees and had made qualifying expenditure. The PIC claims were thus fraudulent. The IRAS disbursed a cash payout and PIC bonus on some of these PIC claims on the basis of the representations made in the PIC forms. The fraud was subsequently discovered following an audit and investigation by IRAS.

3       The investigations by IRAS showed that the defendant had played a critical role in the filing of the fraudulent PIC claims. He was charged under s 37J(4)(b) of the Income Tax Act (Cap 134, Rev Ed 2014) (“**ITA**”). He denied the charges. The prosecution proceeded on three charges at the trial in respect of fraudulent PIC forms submitted for three persons (the three “**Claimants**”). The crux of the defence was that the information in the PIC forms had been provided by the Claimants, and the defendant was unaware that the information was false. This was at odds with the testimony of the Claimants, who each pointed to the defendant as the mastermind.

4       At the conclusion of the trial, the defendant was found guilty and convicted on the three charges. On 31 March 2021, he was sentenced to a total imprisonment term of 36 months and ordered to pay a (mandatory) penalty of $295,272. He filed the present appeal against his conviction and sentence the same day. He is on bail pending the appeal.

5       The grounds of my decision on the conviction and sentence are set out below.

## Trial

### Charges

6       The defendant faced three charges under s 37J(4)(b) of the ITA. The charges were similarly worded, with different particulars relating to the _date_, _Claimant_ and _business entity_ involved:

> You \[…\] are charged that you, as the sole proprietor of Paradize Consultancy (UEN: 53239618M), on or about _\[date\]_, in Singapore, did wilfully with intent to assist _\[Claimant\]_, the sole proprietor of _\[business entity\]_ (“the claimant”) to obtain a cash payout in respect of the Productivity and Innovation Credit (“PIC”) scheme under section 37I of the Income Tax Act (Cap 134) (“ITA”) amounting to $9,606, and PIC bonus under section 37IA of the ITA amounting to $15,000, in respect of the Year of Assessment (“YA”) 2015, to which the claimant was not entitled and you did make use of fraud in representing that the said claimant was a qualifying person for the purposes of section 37I(1) of the ITA, _to wit_, by assisting the said claimant in representing in an irrevocable written election made under section 37I(1) of the ITA that the said claimant employed 3 local employees, such representation you knew to be false, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 37J(4)(_b_) of the ITA.

8       Section 37J(4)(_b_) of the ITA provides:

> (4)    Any person who _wilfully with intent to obtain, or to assist another person to obtain, a cash payout or PIC bonus (or both)_ or a higher amount of cash payout or PIC bonus (or both) _which he or that other person is not entitled to_ —

>> \[…\]

>> (b)    makes use of _any fraud_, art or contrivance or authorises the use of such fraud, art or contrivance,

> shall be guilty of an offence and shall on conviction be punished with a penalty that is 4 times the amount of cash payout or PIC bonus (or both, as the case may be) that has been made to him or that other person as a result of the offence, or which would have been made to him or that other person if the offence had not been detected, and shall also be liable to a fine not exceeding $50,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.

> \[Emphasis added\]

### Prosecution’s case

#### IRAS’ investigations into fraudulent PIC claims

9       An investigator from IRAS, Kong Geok Chin (PW1, “**IO Kong**”), testified[^1] that following an audit by IRAS, there was suspicion that the defendant’s sole proprietorship (PC) was assisting their clients to make fictitious PIC claims. IRAS commenced investigations on the defendant in January 2015, with IO Kong being the lead investigator. He conducted checks on PIC claimants who were clients of PC. On 28 April 2015, his team conducted raids on ten PIC claimants. It was found that none of the PIC claimants had fulfilled the condition of having three local employees. The PIC claimants pointed to the defendant as the key person who gave them instructions on how to make their PIC applications and who facilitated their applications. Further raids were subsequently conducted on more PIC claimants who were clients of PC. None of them met the conditions under the PIC scheme.

10     IO Kong and his team then conducted a raid on PC’s premises on 30 April 2015. They seized documents, computers and mobile devices found on the premises. Among the seized documents were the following:

> (a)     presentation slides and handouts used to sell the PIC scheme to potential clients.[^2] These stated, among other things, that if the PIC claim was successful, half of the payout would be for the PIC claimant and the other half would be for the defendant;

> (b)     an email that was sent by the defendant on 28 April 2015 (during the time the investigations were being conducted) to the clients of PC attaching an FAQ sheet on the answers to be provided by the PIC claimants should they be questioned by IRAS’ investigators.[^3]

#### Fraudulent claim of M Midhuna Event Management (MMEM)

11     Mahendran s/o Rajoo (PW2, “**Mahendran**”) was one of the PIC Claimants. He was the sole proprietor of M Midhuna Event Management (“**MMEM**”). A PIC form dated 30 April 2014 was submitted for MMEM. [^4]

12      _Defendant persuaded Mahendran to make the PIC claim_. Mahendran testified that he became acquainted with the defendant during national service. Sometime in late 2013 or early 2014, the defendant introduced him to the PIC scheme.The defendant gave him brief information on the requirements of the PIC scheme, including the need to have a company with three employees.The defendant used a pamphlet[^5] to explain the specifics of the PIC scheme to him. He understood from the defendant that he would only need to set up a company, have three employees, and the defendant would assist him to obtain $24,606 from IRAS. If the claim was successful, he was to pay half of the total payout to the defendant (_i.e._, $12,303).[^6]

13      _Defendant assisted Mahendran to complete and submit the PIC form._ Mahendran did not have a company and did not have the requisite three employees. The defendant assisted him to register a company, M Midhuna Event Management. He provided to the defendant three names, who were his family members, as employees. (All three were working for other employers at the material time.) The defendant helped him to fill up the PIC form, and he signed the form.[^7]

14     The three persons listed in MMEM’s PIC form[^8] were:

> (a)     Dhanapackiyam d/o Kannan (PW6, “**Dhana**”);

> (b)     Vimala Dewi d/o Neelakandan (PW4, “**Vimala**”); and

> (c)     Nanthakumar s/o Rajoo (PW3, “**Nanthakumar**”).

15     All three testified that they did not work for MMEM.

> (a)     Nanthakumar was Mahendran’s brother. He testified that he had never worked for Mahendran, and he had never heard of MMEM. He was working full-time as an offshore mechanic. He did not know how and why his name and NRIC were on MMEM’s PIC form.[^9]

> (b)     Vimala was Mahendran’s mother. She testified that she was working full-time at Mount Alvernia and had never worked for Mahendran, and she had never heard of MMEM.[^10]

> (c)     Dhana was Mahendran’s wife. She testified that she was working as a bank teller in OCBC Bank. She had never worked for Mahendran or MMEM.[^11]

16      _Defendant convinced Mahendran that the PIC claim was legal._ Mahendran testified that even though he knew that he did not meet the PIC requirements of having three employees, he still went ahead with the claim. He was assured by the defendant that these were just all the documentation that he had to go through to make the claim. He was convinced by the defendant that all was legal. Throughout the PIC application process, he followed whatever instructions the defendant gave.[^12]

17      _Defendant assisted Mahendran when the PIC claim was first rejected_. MMEM’s PIC claim was initially rejected by IRAS.[^13] Mahendran informed the defendant about it. The defendant said that he would draft an email for Mahendran to send to IRAS. The defendant then drafted two letters and attached a CPF contribution slip for March 2014 for the three persons listed as employees of MMEM, and Mahendran forwarded the letter to IRAS by email on 18 June 2014.[^14] IRAS subsequently requested Mahendran for the CPF Record of Payment (Form C90) for March 2014[^15]. The defendant drafted a letter and attached the Form C90 for Mahendran to submit to IRAS.[^16] The defendant was able to extract the CPF contribution slip and Form C90 because Mahendran had disclosed his SingPass to the defendant to obtain CPF records for him as he wanted his PIC application to be approved. It was the defendant who had assisted to make the CPF contributions to the three, and who provided the figures for the “Ordinary Wages” and CPF contributions in the CPF contribution slip and the Form C90. The PIC claim was ultimately approved.[^17]

18      _Defendant prepared Mahendran for impending IRAS audits._ Subsequently, IRAS sent a letter to Mahendran to review the PIC claim.[^18] He immediately reported the matter to the defendant. On 27 April 2016, the defendant sent a WhatsApp message to inform him that IRAS was doing an audit of PIC applicants[^19]; the defendant asked whether IRAS had contacted him and instructed him to read his email to prepare for the audit.[^20]

#### Fraudulent claim of Sharmila Event Management (SEM)

19     Ms Shanthi d/o Peerisamy (PW7, “**Shanthi**”) was another PIC Claimant. She was the sole proprietor of Sharmila Event Management (“**SEM**”). A PIC form dated 30 April 2014 was submitted for SEM. [^21]

20      _Defendant persuaded Shanthi to make the PIC claim_. Shanthi testified that she became acquainted with the defendant while she was running a wedding for her friend. The defendant introduced her to the PIC scheme and stated that she just had to open a company to obtain monies from the government. He told her it was “not necessary to run the company” and she could “just open it and close it” within a month. He also briefly informed her about the requirements of the PIC scheme, and that she needed a company with three persons to contribute CPF to. Upon a successful claim, she would have to pay him half of the amount obtained from IRAS.[^22]

21      _Defendant assisted Shanthi to complete and submit the PIC form_. Shanthi was working as a nursing supervisor and did not have a business entity. The defendant told her that she need not worry as he would help her open up a company for the PIC claim. He assisted her to register SEM[^23] and even suggested the name to her. SEM did not do business and was registered only for the purposes of making the PIC claim. SEM also did not have three employees. The defendant told her that she could use the name of her mother, daughter, or anybody else. He told her that she could “just put \[these\] names there, but not necessary to work.” So she gave to him the names of her mother, daughter and a friend. He filled up the PIC form for her, indicating the revenue of SEM as $1,000 (although it had not made any money at all). He also listed the three names as employees of the company, although they were not working for her and were not paid any wages or CPF. He paid CPF to them (for one month), and provided the figures for the “Ordinary Wages” in the CPF contribution slip.[^24]

22     The three persons listed in SEM’s PIC form[^25] were:

> (a)     Mariana Cecilia Joseph (PW5, “**Mariana**”);

> (b)     Raveena Ann Ramesh (PW8, “**Raveena**”); and

> (c)     Dinesh s/o Tamilarasan (“**Dinesh**”).

23     Mariana and Raveena both testified that they did not work for SEM.

> (a)     Mariana was Shanthi’s mother. She testified that she had never worked for Shanthi or SEM.[^26]

> (b)     Raveena was Shanthi’s daughter. She testified that she had never worked for Shanthi or SEM. At the material time in March 2014, she was unemployed.[^27]

> (c)     (Dinesh, who was Raveena’s friend, was not called as a witness. The prosecution explained that he was uncontactable.)

24      _Defendant convinced Shanthi that the PIC claim was legal_. Shanthi testified that when she asked the defendant whether it was legal to put the names of the three persons who were not her employees, the defendant replied that it was for “formality’s sake” and she just “have to put their names”. He informed her that he had gone for meetings with IRAS to run this PIC scheme. Based on the assurances that he gave her, she trusted that it was legal to do so. She signed the PIC form, and the defendant sent it to IRAS.[^28]

25      _Defendant assisted Shanthi when the PIC claim was first rejected_. SEM’s PIC claim was initially rejected by IRAS.[^29] Shanthi informed the defendant about it. He said that he would do the necessary and the claim would be successful. He then drafted a letter and attached the CPF contribution slip for the three persons listed as employees of SEM. He sent the letter and CPF contribution slip to Shanthi’s email account (through a member of his staff). Shanthi then forwarded the letter to IRAS by email.[^30] Shanthi explained that the defendant was able to extract the CPF contribution slip because she had probably disclosed her SingPass to him. She did so because she trusted him.[^31]

26     SEM’s PIC claim was eventually successful.[^32] Shanthi paid the defendant “$12,000” (which was about half of the total cash payout and PIC bonus that she received from IRAS).[^33]

#### Fraudulent claim of Estrella Eventz (EE)

27     Ms Crystal Priya d/o Ragavan (PW9, “**Crystal**”) was another PIC Claimant. She was the sole proprietor of a business known as Estrella Eventz (“**EE**”)[^34]. A PIC form dated 1 April 2014 was submitted for EE.[^35]

28      _Defendant persuaded Crystal to make the PIC claim_. Crystal testified that she became acquainted with the defendant through various events. He called her and explained to her the PIC scheme. He told her that there was a PIC grant for sole proprietorships, and the requirements were that the business had to be existing for at least one year and had to have three workers.[^36]

29      _Defendant assisted Crystal to complete and submit the PIC form_. The defendant assisted Crystal to fill up the PIC form. He filled up the revenue portion as $1,000 (even though EE was not making money). He told her that since her father and two of her friends were helping out in EE, they could be listed as EE’s employees for the purpose of the PIC claim (although they were helping out at EE only on an ad-hoc basis). The PIC form was pre-filled by the defendant and signed by her. She signed on the form because he assured her that he would “settle the rest”. She knew the defendant and his wife very well, so she trusted him and just followed his instructions and signed the form.[^37]

30     The three persons listed in EE’s PIC form were:

> (a)     Jai Lakshmi d/o Jai Balan (“**Lakshmi**”);

> (b)     Suthakar s/o Anathan (“**Suthakar**”); and

> (c)     Raman Ragavan (“**Raman**”).[^38]

31     Crystal testified that Raman was her father, and the other two persons were her friends. They were helping her out on an ad-hoc basis.Lakshmi helped her to get clients to book her services for events such as birthday parties and weddings; Suthakar drove her to see clients and to view venues; and her father Raman helped out with clients and let people know about her services. They would help her at most once every two to three months. None of them were paid a salary. Instead, they were given _angpow_s or treated to meals. Both Lakshmi and Suthakar had other full-time jobs: Lakshmi was working in a marine company as a member of the administrative staff and Suthakar was working as a logistics driver.[^39]

32     The defendant instructed her to make a one-month CPF contribution to each of them for the purpose of making the PIC claim. She did so accordingly. Prior to that, she had not made any CPF contributions to them; and she did not continue making CPF contributions after that because the defendant said that it “wasn’t necessary”. She disclosed her SingPass to the defendant and he assisted her to make the CPF contributions. He provided the figures for the “Ordinary Wages” component in the CPF submission (although she had told him that she did not pay the three any salary).[^40]

33      _Defendant assisted Crystal when the PIC claim was first rejected_. EE’s PIC claim was initially rejected by IRAS.[^41] Crystal informed the defendant about it. He told her not to do anything, and he would tell her what to do. He then drafted a letter for her to reply to IRAS, and attached the CPF contribution slip for the three persons listed as employees of EE[^42]. He asked her to send it to IRAS, and she did so as instructed. EE’s PIC claim was eventually successful.[^43]

34      _Defendant assisted Crystal when IRAS audited the PIC claim_. Subsequently, IRAS sent a letter to Crystal to review EE’s PIC claim.[^44] She took a picture of the letter and sent it to the defendant. He provided her with a template email[^45] and instructed her to insert her name and to send the letter to IRAS. She followed his instructions and did accordingly.[^46]

#### False information about qualifying PIC expenditure

35     The PIC form of each Claimant stated that qualifying PIC expenditure of $16,010 in total had been incurred, comprising three items:[^47]

> (a)     A “Content Management System Software + Website” (automation equipment) costing $5,000;

> (b)     An external training course costing $5,010; and

> (c)     An “IOS App” (automation equipment) costing $6,000.

36     These were purported expenditures on products and services provided by the defendant’s PC to each Claimant under a “deluxe business package”, and were evidenced by invoices, quotation agreements and receipts (which stated that full payment had been made).[^48] The Claimants testified, however, that they did not incur expenditure for such items and did not receive any of the items from PC; and it was the defendant who inserted the details of the qualifying PIC expenditure in the PIC forms.[^49] The prosecution also adduced other evidence to show that the defendant produced fictitious supporting documents for each purported item of expenditure (discussed later, at \[55\]-\[60\]).

#### FAQs with false answers to IRAS’ queries

37     Evidence was led by the prosecution that the defendant gave a written statement to IRAS on 4 February 2016.[^50] In the statement, he admitted preparing “questionnaires” and sending them to the clients of PC by email on 1 December 2014 and 28 April 2015. He said that he wanted to refresh the memories of PC’s clients who had purchased the website, training and app from PC and made a PIC claim (at \[8\] of the statement).

38     The prosecution’s case was that these contained “FAQ” _template_ answers that PC’s clients were to provide in case they were questioned by IRAS. For example, the following (false) template answer was provided in the email of 1 December 2014: [^51]

> 3.    How many staff do you have in your company?

> Three part-timers.

39     Another document was adduced in evidence entitled “IRAS Audit PIC Questionaire (_sic_.) for April 2014 Clients”. The “April 2014 Clients” would include the present three Claimants.[^52] The document contained the following (false) template answer, among others:[^53]

> DETAILS ABOUT YOUR EMPLOYEES

> 1.    How many staff do you have in your company?

> Three or more part-timers.

### Defence

40     At the close of the case for the prosecution, I found that the prosecution had established a prima facie case on each charge against the defendant. There was some evidence, not inherently incredible, that established the elements of each charge. The defendant was thus called upon to give his defence. He elected to testify.

#### Evidence of defendant

41     The crux of the defence was that the defendant did not know that the PIC claims were fraudulent. The information in each PIC form had been provided by the respective Claimant, and he did not know that the information was false. In particular, he did not know that the three persons listed in each PIC form were not genuine employees.

42     The defendant testified that he informed each Claimant about the PIC scheme on separate occasions sometime in 2013 or 2014. He told them that he had opened PC, and that it offered IT products and services and training workshops for businesses to upskill (or upscale) their business. If they bought any products and services from PC, PC would provide a value-added service of guiding and assisting them to apply for the PIC grant.[^54]

43     The defendant testified that the Claimants each procured a website, training course and mobile app (iOS app) from PC. He created a website for each Claimant and hosted each website for a year.[^55] PC provided training (e-courses) to the employees of each Claimant.[^56] PC also designed and developed an iOS mobile app for each Claimant.[^57]

44     As for the PIC forms, the defendant testified that what was filled in each PIC form was what the business owner (_i.e._, the Claimant) had told him. The Claimant provided the information, and he just typed it in. Each Claimant provided three names to him as their employees. He trusted that they were employees as stated. He did not know if they were genuine employees, and he had no means to check if the employees had worked for the Claimant or not. Each Claimant read the declaration portion under Part C of the PIC form and signed the form.[^58] In signing the form, the Claimant declared that the business was still in operation and had met “the conditions of employing and making CPF contributions for at least 3 local employees \[…\] in the last month of the relevant financial period” (point 4); and that the Claimant had “met the qualifying conditions for all the claims and that the information given in this form and applicable annexes are true and complete” (point 5). The Claimants were thus responsible for the accuracy of the form.[^59]

#### Evidence of defence witnesses

45     A number of defence witnesses were called to corroborate the defendant’s account. They included two ex-members of his staff at PC: Mageshwari d/o Elango (DW5, “**Mages**”) and Shamani d/o J Alexander Vincent (DW6, “**Shamani**”). The defendant’s wife, who supervised the staff at PC, was also called to testify: A K Sahtyah d/o J Alexander Vincent (DW7, “**Sahtyah**”). The gist of their testimony was that PC provided websites, e-learning and mobile apps to the Claimants; that Mages and Shamani attended to the Claimants and assisted them to file their PIC forms; and that it was the Claimants who provided the details such as employee information to fill up the PIC forms.[^60]

### Issues to be determined

46     From the evidence adduced, the following points were not in dispute:

> (a)     the defendant and his staff at PC assisted each Claimant to submit a PIC form to make a PIC claim;

> (b)     the Claimants were ineligible to make a PIC claim as they did not meet the conditions, including having three local employees;

> (c)     the PIC forms each falsely stated that the Claimant had three local employees;

> (d)     based on the false statements in each PIC form, a PIC cash payout and bonus was wrongly paid out to each Claimant which they were not entitled to.

47     The main issues in dispute were as follows:

> (a)     Whether the defendant wilfully assisted each Claimant to submit their PIC claim with intent to assist each of them to obtain the PIC cash payout and bonus; and

> (b)     Whether the defendant knew that each Claimant did not have the requisite three local employees to be eligible to make the PIC claim and used fraud in assisting them to make the PIC claim.

### Decision

#### Defendant wilfully assisted Claimants to submit PIC claims

48     According to the defendant, he had set up PC to offer IT products and services and training workshops for businesses to upscale their businesses. PC provided a website, training course and mobile app for each Claimant; and a value-added service to assist them to apply for the PIC grant. PC did not persuade or compel them to sign up for the products and services and apply for the PIC grant; they did so purely of their own interest and intention. PC facilitated the filling up of the PIC form for each Claimant, and the details of the employees were provided by them. PC also guided them on how to make CPF contributions, and they were the ones who used their confidential SingPass accounts to make the CPF contributions. Information on employee salary and personal details were fed into the CPF website by them.

49     The defendant’s account, however, was contradicted by the testimony of the Claimants (above, at \[11\]-\[36\]). Mahendran, Shanthi and Crystal each testified that the defendant persuaded them to make the PIC claim and assisted them in completing their PIC form. They relied on him fully and followed his instructions throughout the PIC application process, which included the registration of a business entity (in the case of Mahendran and Shanthi), the persons who could be indicated as local employees on the PIC form (although they had no employee), and the making of CPF contributions to these persons. They trusted the defendant and disclosed their confidential SingPass to him, so that he could assist to make the CPF contributions and retrieve the CPF records. The PIC forms stated that their business had each incurred qualifying PIC expenditure for a website, training course and mobile app, although they did not incur such expenditure and did not receive the products and services (above, at \[35\]-\[36\]). Yet they trusted the defendant and went ahead to make the PIC claim. Even when some of them expressed reservations about their eligibility under the PIC scheme, the defendant assured them that it was legal to do so, and that he would do the necessary to make their PIC claim successful. They also relied on him to deal with queries from IRAS after their PIC claim was initially rejected. In return for his assistance in making the PIC claim, they agreed to pay him half the PIC cash payout and bonus that they obtained.

50     I found the evidence of the Claimants to be truthful and credible. Their testimonies were internally consistent, corroborated by documentary evidence, and were not contradicted by the defence during cross-examination. On the other hand, I found the evidence of the defendant to be untruthful and there was clear evidence of fraud on his part (discussed below, at \[54\]-\[62\]). I also found the evidence of the defendant’s wife (Sahtyah) and ex-staff at PC (Mages and Shamani) to be no more than bare assertions which sought to corroborate the defendant’s account but lacked credibility (discussed below, at \[63\]-\[67\]).

51     Having considered the credible testimony of the Claimants and the totality of the evidence, I found that the defendant had wilfully assisted the Claimants to submit their PIC forms. This was done with intent to assist them to obtain the PIC cash payout and bonus. He had a clear motive for doing so, as he stood to benefit from half of the amount disbursed to each Claimant.

#### Defendant knew the PIC claims were fraudulent

52     The Claimants each testified that they did not have three local employees. The defendant told each of them that, in order to fulfil this condition of the PIC claim, they needed only to find three names and to contribute CPF to them. The defendant assisted to make the CPF contributions, filling in fictitious figures for the ordinary wages component of the CPF submission for the purported employees of each Claimant.

53     The testimony of the Claimants was clear, consistent and credible. The irresistible inference was that the defendant _knew_ that each Claimant did not have the requisite three local employees to file a PIC claim, because none of these purported employees was being paid a salary by the Claimant. I accepted the testimony of the Claimants that the defendant was the one who submitted _fictitious_ figures for the ordinary wages component of the CPF submissions. The defendant perpetrated a fraud to create the false impression that each Claimant had three local employees as stated in their PIC form, when he knew that they had none.

#### Fraud relating to qualifying PIC expenditure

54     The evidence further showed the extensive scale of the fraud perpetrated by the defendant. Evidence was led by the prosecution to show that the defendant used fictitious documents to support the qualifying PIC expenditure for each PIC claim, which comprised a website, training course and mobile app (above, at \[35\]-\[36\]). The clear testimony of the Claimants was that they did not incur expenditure for such items and did not receive such products and services from PC. I found their testimony to be truthful, and there was no credible evidence of any such products and services being provided by PC to the Claimants, as claimed by the defendant.

##### (1)   Purported provision of website

55     The defendant claimed that he created a website for each Claimant and hosted each website for a year (above, at \[43\]). The prosecution led evidence, however, that based on a search on the history of the purported websites online, they were skeletal websites. For example, the directory tree of the purported websites for MMEM and SEM showed the size of the folders for these two websites to be only four kilobytes each, and the two websites had no content. Further, the three websites were only put up on 2 September 2014,[^61] which was about five months _after_ the PIC forms of the Claimants had been submitted.

56     I accepted the submission of the prosecution that, at the time the PIC form of each Claimant was submitted (in April 2014), the defendant had not created the website for each Claimant, and his claim to have done so was untrue. In fact, no websites were provided to the Claimants, and there was no basis on which the cost of the websites could be claimed as qualifying PIC expenditure in each PIC form.

##### (2)   Purported provision of training course

57     The defendant claimed that PC provided training to the employees of the Claimants, and that an “e-course” was provided (above, at \[43\]). There was no credible evidence, however, that such courses were provided at all. PC’s “Course Attendance Sheets” which purported to bear the signatures of the persons who attended the courses were tendered in evidence.[^62] Evidence was led from various witnesses, however, that no training course had been provided and they were simply asked to append their signatures on the Course Attendance Sheet.[^63] Further, the defendant claimed that he _created_ PowerPoint presentations on “Total Quality Management” and “Operations Management” for the training.[^64] These claims were shown by the prosecution to be false, as the presentation slides had all been plagiarised off the Internet.[^65] Plainly, the defendant had created false Course Attendance Sheets and plagiarised presentation slides to give the impression that PC did conduct training courses for its clients, including the employees of the Claimants, when in fact no such courses were conducted.

##### (3)   Purported provision of mobile app

58     The defendant claimed that PC designed and developed an iOS mobile app for each Claimant (above, at \[43\]). He tendered some screenshots purporting to show that the mobile apps had been published on the Apple Store.[^66] He also claimed that each mobile app cost $5,000 and tendered in evidence invoices from the app vendor to substantiate his claim.[^67]

59     The defendant’s claims were, however, refuted by two rebuttal witnesses called by the prosecution. Mohamed Alfaseeh Maricar (PW10, “**Alfaseeh**”) and Suresh s/o Superamaniam (PW11, “**Suresh**”) were representatives of the app vendor engaged by the defendant to develop the mobile apps. Alfaseeh explained that the screenshots tendered by the defendant were of the app _developer_ page (and not the App Store). He had given the screenshots to the defendant to show to the defendant that the work on the apps had been completed. The apps of the three Claimants were, however, never published on the App Store.[^68] Alfaseeh further testified that the defendant was charged $500 per mobile app developed. When asked about the invoices produced by the defendant that stated that $5,000 was charged (instead of $500), Alfaseeh and Suresh testified that it was the defendant who asked for those invoices to be issued to him; otherwise, according to him, payment could not be made for the work done. [^69] That $500 was in fact charged for each app was set out in a “Statement of Work” _dated 14 July 2014_ signed by the defendant.[^70]

60     I found the testimony of Alfaseeh and Suresh to be credible, and corroborated by the objective evidence in the Statement of Works. On the other hand, the defendant’s claims that he provided a mobile app for each Claimant, at a cost of $5,000 each, was plainly a lie. It was reasonable to conclude that the defendant had procured fictitious invoices with an inflated cost of $5,000 per app in an attempt to support the false qualifying PIC expenditures for the fraudulent PIC claims that had earlier been submitted for each Claimant.

#### Other evidence of fraud

61     There were other falsehoods perpetrated by the defendant. In each PIC form, the defendant entered a fictitious figure of $1,000 as the revenue to give the false impression that each Claimant’s business was generating that amount of revenue when it was not (above, at \[13\], \[21\], \[29\]).

62     When the PIC claim of each Claimant was initially rejected, the defendant assisted the Claimant to draft a reply to IRAS. He also coached them on how to respond when they were being audited by IRAS. He prepared and sent out template responses to FAQs (above, at \[37\]-\[39\]). The Claimants were specifically instructed by the defendant to say, among other things, that they had three part-timers on their staff. Such action on the part of the defendant could only be explained by the fact that he _knew_ that the Claimants did not have genuine local employees; and he knew that the PIC claims he assisted the Claimants to submit were fraudulent. Had he thought the PIC claims to be genuine, there would have been no need for him to send the FAQs and give specific instructions to the Claimants on how to reply to IRAS.

#### Defence witnesses were not credible

63     The defence witnesses who worked at PC (the defendant’s wife, Sahtyah; and his ex-staff, Mages and Shamani) testified that PC provided websites, training courses and mobile apps to the Claimants; Mages and Shamani assisted the Claimants to fill up their PIC forms; and it was the Claimants who provided the details such as employee information to fill up the PIC forms.

64     I did not find their evidence to be credible. Their evidence amounted to no more than bare assertions that appear to have been rehearsed, and were uncorroborated by any credible objective evidence. Their evidence was also flatly contradicted by the credible testimony of the Claimants. The oral testimony of Mages and Shamani, in particular, were shown to be materially inconsistent with their prior written statements and were contradicted by objective evidence.

65     Mages’ testimony that she assisted the Claimants to fill up their PIC forms was materially inconsistent with a statement that she gave on 9 June 2015, soon after IRAS commenced investigations. In that statement she said that her involvement was “mostly handling _withdrawals_ of PIC application of previous customers and also _preparing refund receipts_ for these customers” (emphasis added)[^71], with no mention at all about assisting customers to fill up PIC forms. In any case, it was highly unlikely that she could have assisted the present Claimants to fill up their PIC forms in or around April 2014, considering that she started working for the defendant only in January 2015[^72]. Further, Mages asserted in her testimony that she was present when two IRAS officers visited PC on 10 September 2014, and the defendant gave a demonstration of the services that PC gave to the clients, and the IRAS officers complimented him; and that she stayed on at PC’s office until the end of that workday at about 6.00 pm.[^73] Under cross-examination, she was asked whether she worked for another company at the material time, to which she replied in the negative.[^74] The prosecution then produced a time log sheet of that company which showed that Mages was working at that company at that time, and that she was present at the premises of that company on 10 September 2014; Mages eventually conceded that she was never at PC’s office on 10 September 2014 when the two IRAS officers visited it.[^75] I found Mages to be not a credit-worthy witness, and very little weight could be attached to her testimony.

66     Shamani testified that the particulars in the PIC forms were all provided by the Claimants. When questioned during cross-examination, she said that the defendant had never given any instructions to fill in “1,000” as the customer’s revenue in the PIC form, or that the customers could provide any three names as employees even when the customer did not have any employees.[^76] Her testimony, however, was materially inconsistent with a statement that she gave on 11 June 2015. In that statement, she provided an extensive account of the instructions given by the defendant on how PC’s customers were to be assisted in making the PIC claim. This included information about the three “employees” and the amount of revenue to be indicated:

> 11)     _Chandran instructed me to tell the customers to provide any 3 names with their NRIC information as “employees” to claim the PIC cash payout even if the customer does not have any employees._ Chandran said the 3 individuals can become their future employees if they really start the business.

> 12)     _I know that some customers do not conduct any business and their revenue rightfully should be zero._ However, as one of the conditions for the PIC cash payout is customers need to be carrying on active business operation in Singapore, _Chandran instructed me to indicate $1,000 as the revenue for the relevant periods on the PIC cash payout application form for these customers to show IRAS that these customers have an active business operation._ I do not know how the $1,000 is derived. \[…\][^77]

> (Emphasis added)

67     What was recorded in Shamani’s statement was consistent with the testimonies of the Claimants. In my judgement, it was more likely to be truthful and accurate than her testimony in court. Paragraph 11 of the statement, in particular, shed light on the defendant’s instructions to his staff that PC would still assist their customers to submit PIC applications even where they did not have three employees. This was clear evidence of the defendant’s knowledge and intention to assist the Claimants to submit fraudulent PIC claims, and of his _modus operandi_. It corroborated the testimony of the Claimants that they were simply told to provide “any 3 names”.

#### Verdict

68     Having considered the totality of the evidence at the trial, I found the evidence of the Claimants (Mahendran, Shanti or Crystal) to be credible, that the defendant had persuaded them to submit a PIC claim, and advised and assisted them in filling up their PIC forms, including telling them that they could provide any three names as their employees. I rejected the claim of the defendant that he did not know that the three persons listed as employees in each PIC form were not in fact genuine employees. I found that the defendant had wilfully assisted each Claimant to submit a fraudulent PIC claim, knowing that the Claimant was ineligible, and the defendant used fraud in doing so. He had a clear motive, as he stood to pocket half the amount disbursed from each successful PIC claim.

69     The evidence went further to show that the extent of the fraud went beyond the false statements relating to the three local employees. In each PIC form, a fictitious figure of $1,000 was entered as the revenue to give the false impression that each Claimant had an active business generating that amount of revenue when it did not. Details relating to the qualifying PIC expenditure were false, and supported by fictitious invoices, quotation agreements and receipts. The defendant’s claims to have provided a website, training course and mobile app to each Claimant were all untrue. Fictitious course attendance sheets were created to give the impression that training was provided to the Claimants when no such courses were conducted. PowerPoint slides purportedly created by the defendant for the training had in fact been plagiarised off the Internet. The defendant applied pressure on his vendor to create fictitious invoices to inflate the cost of apps purportedly provided to each Claimant. He took steps to coach the Claimants to give false responses should they be queried by IRAS about their claims. All these steps taken by the defendant in support of the fraudulent PIC claims pointed clearly to his guilt.

70     Therefore, I found that the prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt the charges against the defendant, and the defendant was found guilty and convicted on all three charges.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed sentence

71     For each offence under s 37J(4)(b) of the ITA, the offender shall “be punished with a penalty that is 4 times the amount of cash payout or PIC bonus (or both, as the case may be) that has been made to him or that other person as a result of the offence, or which would have been made to him or that other person if the offence had not been detected”. In addition, the offender “shall also be liable to a fine not exceeding $50,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.”

72     Further, under s 37J(4A) of the ITA, where an individual was convicted of two or more such offences, the imprisonment that the individual would be liable to “shall not be less than 6 months”.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

73     The prosecution submitted that a sentence of at least 18 months’ imprisonment ought to be imposed for each charge, with two to run consecutively to give a total sentence of at least 36 months’ imprisonment. This was in addition to a mandatory financial penalty of $295,272. It was also submitted that if the penalty was not paid, there ought to be a default imprisonment term of 30 weeks (or about one week for every $10,000).[^78]

74     It was submitted that the dominant sentencing consideration ought to be deterrence. General deterrence would be the predominant sentencing consideration where the victim of fraud was a public institution administering public funds, such as IRAS. A sentencing framework was proposed with a harm-culpability matrix setting out the indicative sentencing ranges.[^79] This was to give consideration to the full sentencing range of the offence in a principled manner. It was submitted that the harm was at least _moderate_, with reference to the large amounts of payouts involved in the three charges and the potential harm to public confidence in the effective administration of public funds. It was also submitted that the defendant’s culpability fell on the higher end of the spectrum of _medium culpability_. The indicative sentencing range, under the proposed harm-culpability matrix, was between 18 to 27 months’ imprisonment. There were a number of aggravating factors that necessitated the imposition of a stiff sentence: substantial amounts were involved and the defendant enjoyed personal gain; there was a high degree of planning and premeditation by the defendant, involving multiple layers of fraud; the offences were difficult to detect; the defendant led others to defraud. The defendant’s conduct at the trial was also an aggravating factor. Although the defendant had no prior convictions, it was submitted that he should not be treated as a first-time offender; based on the multiplicity of offences committed, he ought to be treated as a repeat offender. He had shown no remorse.

75     Various sentencing precedents were cited by the prosecution, and the relevant precedents are considered below (at \[83\]-\[84\]).

### Mitigation Plea

76     In the defendant’s mitigation plea[^80], he continued to maintain his innocence, and pleaded for the court to exercise leniency. He was 40 years of age, a Singapore citizen, and married with a ten-year-old son. His mother was 75 years old and residing with him. He was the sole breadwinner of the family. He said that he had been very cooperative with the authorities during the investigations, that he was a first-time offender, of good character and a reputable celebrity. He attached copies of certificates and awards of his past accomplishments as a magician, his educational qualifications, and his national service achievements.

77     He said that his mother was suffering from numerous pressing medical issues; his wife was suffering from depression. He was a patient at the Institute of Mental Health and undergoing treatment for major depression; and he had other ailments, such as chronic lung disease. The mandatory financial penalty would be a heavy burden for him to bear, and the imposition of an imprisonment term would cause his family to lose the financial support of their sole breadwinner. He had suffered mental anguish, anxiety and distress as a result of the charges hanging over his head since they were filed (in January 2017). He had lost business opportunities and suffered a huge loss of income as a result of the charges. Local and international media coverage of his criminal proceedings have led to his suppliers and customers refusing to work with him.

### Decision on Sentence

#### Sentencing objective

78     In deciding on the sentence, I considered the dominant sentencing consideration to be _deterrence_. The defendant was the mastermind of an elaborate scheme to defraud the IRAS by submitting fraudulent PIC claims. The amounts claimed were large, and the defendant benefitted personally from a large proportion of each amount disbursed. The highly premeditated scheme involved, among other things, registering shell businesses, making CPF contributions for fictitious employees, and fabricating evidence such as fictitious invoices, receipts, training materials and course attendance sheets – all of which were done for the purpose of supporting the fraudulent PIC claims. Such egregious conduct had to be deterred, both generally and specifically. A substantial term of imprisonment was necessary to achieve that objective.

#### Harm and culpability

79     In my judgment, the harm for each charge was moderate. The actual harm in terms of the amount of cash payout and PIC bonus disbursed in each case was large ($24,606), although it was not near the maximum cash payout of $60,000 allowable at the material time: s 37I(4) of the ITA. Account was also taken of the potential harm that could have been caused in undermining public confidence in the effective administration of public funds by IRAS.

80     I assessed the defendant’s culpability for each charge to be in the medium range. While his conduct was not the worst that could be envisaged for such offences, it was highly egregious. There were a number of factors that increased his culpability:

> (a)     His actions had a corrupting influence on others. He instigated each Claimant to submit a fraudulent PIC claim. He actively persuaded them to make a claim knowing that they were not eligible. He helped them to complete their PIC form. He gave false assurances to them that their PIC claim was legitimate and induced them to sign the PIC form and to proceed with the PIC claim.

> (b)     The offences involved much planning and premeditation. He recruited the persons to be involved in his fraudulent scheme: he persuaded each Claimant to make a PIC claim, briefed them on how to make the claim, and assisted them to do so. He helped Mahendran and Shanthi each to register a shell business entity. He helped the Claimants to create the false impression that they had three local employees by arranging for token CPF contributions to be made to each purported employee, and generating the CPF contribution print-out as proof of their employment. He used fictitious invoices, quotation agreements and receipts of payment to support the false qualifying PIC expenditures of each Claimant.

> (c)     He received substantial personal benefit from his fraudulent scheme. Half of the amount disbursed on each fraudulent PIC claim was given to him.

> (d)     He took active steps to cover his tracks and avoid detection, particularly when IRAS was auditing and investigating the PIC claims. These included creating fictitious course attendance sheets, training materials and invoices to give the impression that the Claimants had genuinely purchased and received goods and services from PC and incurred qualifying PIC expenditure. He prepared and sent FAQs to coach the Claimants on how to respond to IRAS’ queries. I accepted the submission of the prosecution that the offences were difficult to detect, and much time and resources had to be expended to investigate and prosecute the offences.

#### Aggravating and mitigating factors

81     I accepted the submission of the prosecution that the defendant’s conduct at the trial was an aggravating factor. He repeatedly cast serious aspersions on the conduct of the investigations by IRAS. He alleged that IRAS’ officers were fraudulent, abusing their power, engaged in a “malicious plot” to suborn witnesses; that PC’s employees had been tampered with and threatened to say things against him; and that the investigation officer was vindictive and had mistreated him during the taking of his statement.[^81] These allegations were baseless and highly aggravating.

82     There were no mitigating factors in the defendant’s favour. He insisted on his innocence despite the overwhelming evidence of his extensive fraud. At no point did he express any remorse. He has not made any restitution. While he might have been facing severe medical, mental, emotional, financial and other personal hardships, these were not considerations that mitigated the sentence. That the trial process took a considerable length of time since he was first charged (on 27 January 2017) was largely attributable to his actions in delaying matters by changing counsel several times, and indicating an intention to plead guilty only to change his decision no less than twice in the course of the trial (in 2018, and again in 2020). The delay could not be considered as a mitigating factor that warranted a reduction in the sentence.

#### Sentencing precedents

83     The prosecution made reference to some sentencing precedents.[^82] The relevant precedents which involved charges under s 37J(4)(b) of the ITA are summarised in the following table:

84     The prosecution submitted that circumstances in which the defendant committed the present offences were far more aggravated than in the precedents cited. The defendant perpetrated a systematic and deliberate fraud, and it was drastically different in nature, character and extent from the previous cases. It was also pointed out that in _Xu Feng Jia_, the offender was fully remorseful and had made full restitution of whatever was disbursed by IRAS even before he was charged in court. In _Tan Sin Long_, one of the charges involved a PIC amount of $36,000, which was close to the amount disbursed in the present case ($24,606). For that charge, the offender was sentenced to 12 months and two weeks’ imprisonment and the mandatory penalty of $144,000. The offender in _Tan Sin Long_ pleaded guilty, demonstrated remorse and made partial restitution of $600. In _Loh Gai Kuang Dezmond_, not all the PIC monies were disbursed, and the offender displayed remorse by pleading guilty at the first possible instance. In contrast, the present defendant claimed trial and remained unremorseful even after his conviction, and made no restitution.

#### Appropriate sentence

85     All in, having regard to the moderate harm and medium culpability for each charge, and the aggravating factors and the lack of mitigating factors, I accepted the submission of the prosecution that a sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment was appropriate for each charge. This was higher than the individual sentences imposed in the precedent cases but, in my judgment, entirely justifiable on account of the many aggravating factors in the present case. The defendant was motivated by personal financial benefit, and he masterminded a systematic and meticulous scheme to defraud IRAS. He demonstrated a persistent lack of remorse despite the overwhelming evidence against him. And, at the trial, he conducted his defence in an egregious manner, making grave and spurious allegations against IRAS’ officers. In addition, there was a mandatory penalty of four times the amount of cash payout and PIC bonus for each charge amounting to $98,424 ($24,606 x 4), in default of which a term of imprisonment of 10 weeks was reasonable. Accordingly, the defendant was sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment as well as a penalty of $98,424 (in default, 10 weeks’ imprisonment) for each charge.

86     At least two of the sentences of imprisonment had to be ordered to run consecutively: s 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68). I ordered that the sentences for two offences (MSC-902626-2016 and MSC-902628-2016) run consecutively. The total sentence was thus 36 months’ imprisonment, and a penalty of $295,272 (in default 30 weeks’ imprisonment). In my judgement, this was not a crushing sentence and was proportionate to the overall gravity of the defendant’s offences, and appropriate to achieve deterrence.

### Sentence imposed

87     In summary, the sentence imposed was as follows:

88     The execution of the sentence of imprisonment and the payment of the penalty have been stayed pending the appeal. The defendant is on bail pending the appeal.
