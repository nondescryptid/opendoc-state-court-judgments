### District Judge Marvin Bay:

## INTRODUCTION

1       This case concerns a prosecution by the State against Loh Siang Piow alias Loh Chan Pew (Mr Loh). Mr Loh is a Singaporean presently aged 75. The Prosecution has proceeded on two charges for sexual offences committed in 2013, while Mr Loh was aged 68. Mr Loh is a figure of note in the local athletics scene, having achieved prominence in track and field events in the Singapore South East Asia Peninsular (SEAP) Games in the seventies. He has also held high office in the Singapore Athletic Association (SAA), and heavily involved himself in coaching duties. Mr Loh had been coaching for 35 years since the early 1980s and had coached an estimated 600 to 700 athletes during this period. At the material time of 2013, Mr Loh was coaching more than 70 trainees.

2       The accusations against him have come in the course of his activities of his role as a coach. Mr Loh claimed trial to two charges of having committed outrages of modesty contrary to section 354(1) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Rev. Ed.) to a young woman he had undertaken to train (hereinafter referred to as Ms C), in the course of administering massages after training sessions.

3       The events had occurred in early 2013 at Tampines Stadium, a building which no longer exists. Tampines Stadium has been demolished to make way for the integrated mall and stadium now known as _Our Tampines Hub_. This has inevitably added a layer of complexity in this case, particularly where area of dispute over salient features of the building could not be conclusively resolved, despite considerable efforts at reconstruction. There is, nevertheless, a substratum of common ground that an equipment room existed under the spectator’s stand of the Stadium, and that there were benches at the corridor under the spectator’s stand. These were the structures where the alleged acts of molestation were committed. There are no independent witnesses who witnessed the incidents, and the case thus fundamentally hinged on the of parsing over the accounts of the putative victim, as against the competing version proffered by Mr Loh. Theses account had to be tested against a factual matrix of circumstantial and documentary evidence, including near contemporary accounts of the incident narrated to Ms W, another trainee (who has maintained a set of accusations against Mr Loh, which are not the subject matter of the proceedings at trial), and Mr A, a confidant of the Accused, to whom Ms C had revealed the acts of molest in what both asserted to be a reciprocal unburdening of issues troubling each person, after Mr A had confessed his angst over his sexual orientation.

4       The case has also been complicated by the fact that investigations had only begun in 2016, after Ms C lodged the first information report in the afternoon of 30 July 2016 at about 2.15 pm[^1], more than **_three years_** after the alleged incidents forming the bases of the charges.

### The charges

5       The specifics of the charges (in their final iteration) state:

> (i)     MAC-904652-2017 (First proceeded charge marked “C1”)[^2]

>> “ (Mr Loh is) charged that (he), on a Sunday between January 2013 and 17 March 2013 between at or around 12 p.m. and at or around 6 p.m. on a bench along the corridor leading to the gate below the spectators’ sitting area of Tampines Stadium located at 25 Tampines Street 82, Singapore, did use criminal force on one (Ms C), a female then aged 18 years old, to wit, by rubbing her vulva region over her clothing with his digit in the course of massaging the back of her thighs, knowing it to be likely that he will thereby outrage her modesty.”

> (ii)     MAC-904653-2017 (Second proceeded charge marked “C2”)[^3]

>> “(Mr Low is) charged that (he), on or about 15 March 2013 between at or around 12 p.m. and at or around 6 p.m. on a massage bed inside an equipment room under the spectators’ sitting area of Tampines Stadium located at 25 Tampines Street 82, Singapore, did use criminal force on one (Ms C), a female then aged 18 years old, to wit, by rubbing her vulva region over her clothing with his digit in the course of massaging the back of her thighs, knowing it to be likely that he will thereby outrage her modesty.

### The parties

6       Mr Loh has already been introduced, I will now turn to the complainant: Ms C. Ms C had aspired to be a national level athlete, after some success in short-distance sprints, from JC1. In junior college, she had represented Singapore in the SEA Youth Championship 2012, and after her ‘A’ Levels, was referred by her track teacher, Ms Michelle Eng (DW5), to Mr Loh to continue track training and participate in sprint competitions after her exit from junior college. In the course of her track training with Mr Loh, she had met Ms W, an accomplished national level athlete. Outside of the _alibi_ defence, Mr Loh and Ms Eng would be the principal witnesses for the other aspect of the defence case, which was to maintain a proposition that the accounts provided by the two accusers; Ms C and Ms W, were suspect, and they could thus not be regarded as reliable witnesses.

7       In the proceedings, the prosecution called the following witnesses:

> (a)     PW1- Ms C’s father; “Mr F”.

> (b)     PW 2- Ms C’s mother; “Ms M”.

> (c)     PW-3- The complainant; Ms C.

> (d)     PW4- Ms W; a fellow female trainee to whom Ms C had shared her near-contemporaneous account in 2013.

> (e)     PW5 -Mr A; a friend of Ms C, to whom she had confided in in 2013.

> (f)     PW6- Principal Meteorologist Ang Chieng Hai

> (g)     PW7- SPF W/Sergeant Nur Sahidah Binte Ibrahim-recorder of FIR.

> (h)     PW8- SI Alan Khor Teck Ming-Investigation Officer

8       As a gag order was in force, the names of some witnesses in these grounds have been replaced by alphabetical abbreviations, which are generally linked by their relationship with the complainant. As a convenient mnemonic to better follow the evidence of these prosecution witnesses in these grounds, the basis for the chosen letters for their anonymised and abbreviated names are as follows:

>   
| 

PW1:

 | 

Mr **F**(_ather of Complainant_)

 |
| 

PW 2:

 | 

Ms **M**(_other of Complainant_)

 |
| 

PW 3:

 | 

Ms **C**(_omplanant_)

 |
| 

PW 4:

 | 

Ms **W**(_itness_)

 |
| 

PW5:

 | 

Mr **A**(_nother witness_)

 |

  
  

9       The defence case involved the following:

> (a)     DW1- Loh Siang Piow; the accused person.

> (b)     DW2-Tan Kok Beng Terry; long-term associate of accused and alibi witness.

> (c)     DW3-Katharina Khng Lay Hua- wife of accused person.

> (d)     DW4-Loh Sian Kok-brother of accused person.

> (e)     DW5-Eng Wei Ping Michelle-school coach who referred Ms C to accused.

> (f)     DW6- Oon Kuan Yong- Trainee coached by accused person.

> (g)     DW7-Tan Wei Leong: former coach of Ms C.

> (h)     DW8-Mylvaganam Jayalaxmi; Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus (Toa Payoh) (hereinafter abbreviated to “CHIJ (Toa Payoh)”) coach and alibi witness.

> (i)     DW9-Amirah Aljunied; former track and field trainee at CHIJ (Toa Payoh).

> (j)     DW10-Tan Wei Jie, Eugene; former trainee of accused.

10     The prosecution subsequently called three rebuttal witnesses

> (a)     PW9 Paulin Theboral Solomon; staff member of CHIJ (Toa Payoh)

> (b)     PW10 Chan Chiang, Daryl; staff member of CHIJ (Toa Payoh)

> (c)     PW11 Station Inspector Goh Teck Heng; initial investigation officer.

For these grounds, where the terms “DPP” and “counsel” are mentioned, they should be taken to refer to lead DPP; Ms Gail Wong and Ms Lew Chen Chen, respectively.

## THE CASE FOR THE PROSECUTION

### Outline of case (incorporating the account of the complainant: PW3)

11     The following is an outline on the sequence of events leading to the commission of the alleged acts of outrages of modesty, as related by the prosecution witnesses, principally the complainant, Ms C. This outline is intended to facilitate a grasp of the sequence of events within the factual matrix from the perspective of Ms C and the key prosecution witnesses called to corroborate her account. I have set out the outline in some detail, as to set the scene, and allow for perspective view of the interaction between events and parties involved. Having this established would allow a more granular examination of each witness’ evidence in the later part of these grounds. The events are set off from the narrative point-of-view of the complainant, Ms C. Specific aspects of the evidence of other witnesses which I found significant will be set out and described later in these grounds.

### Enrolment into group training programme

12     At the instance of Michelle Eng, Ms C had embarked into a training programme with the accused which had run a short duration and had been fairly intense from January 2013 to 17 March 2013. Ms C had continued training after starting university, but this had tapered off in intensity. Ms C had her plate full, as she was concurrently involved in an internship from the beginning of January 2013 to 29 April 2013, which had required her to worked weekdays, but would still leave around 4.00 pm to 4.30 pm each day for training. These were **_group_** training sessions, which would run almost daily six times a week from Monday to Saturday together with other “private athletes”. These athletes were so dubbed as they were not participating in the coaching as part of any official school training session. For the more formalised school-based training, Mr Loh coached a cadre of school athletes in secondary schools (such a CHIJ (Toa Payoh)), junior colleges such as Catholic Junior College (CJC), and in institutions of higher learning such as Nanyang Technological University (NTU).

13     For the group training sessions, Mr Loh would assume full control and gave directions on the time and place of training. The training was also eclectic rather than formally structured, as Mr Loh would also only state the workout or training programme that would be performed at the session itself, generally not giving any advance notice of the routine before the session.

### Invitation to undergo individual training sessions

14     It was Ms C’s testimony that Mr Loh proposed to organise _one-on-one_ or individual training sessions for her benefit some two months after she had started training under him. Ms C’s recollection was that these sessions ran from around end-January 2013 to mid-March 2013. These one-on-one individual training sessions where she was Mr Loh’s sole trainee were premised on the prospect of her improving her performance at the sprint series competitions which were coming up. Ms C had indicated that she ‘_felt lucky’_ to have one-on-one training and was impressed in the interest Mr Loh had shown in improving her performance.

15     Ms C placed her sessions to have occurred usually on a Sunday between end-January 2013 and mid-March 2013. These sessions, which were scheduled by a call from Mr Loh, all occurred at Tampines Stadium. Because of the effluxion of time, Ms C could not be certain whether the sessions had taken place in the morning or evening. She could however narrow down the likely timeframes and believed that the sessions would have commenced between 9.00 am to 10.00 am in mornings, and around 4.00 pm to 5.00 pm for the evening sessions. She indicated that the trainings would last between one and one and a half hours in duration, and these would thus conclude at 11.30 am to 12.00 pm for the morning session, and about 5.30 pm to 6.30 pm for the evening sessions.

### The first individual training session

16     Ms C’s evidence was that the first session passed without incident. Ms C had warmed up alone and then followed Mr Loh’s instructions for the workout. Given the uneventful nature of this first individual session, Ms C was unable to recall any distinct details. After Ms C had completed her workout, Mr Loh had proffered a ‘cool down’ massage on the premise that there was a surfeit of time, given that this was a one-on-one training. Ms C had thought nothing about this offer and agreed to be massaged. Ms C lay prone as Mr Low massaged her calves in a rubbing motion moving from her ankles to her knees. She described the movements as a rubbing motion typically used to loosen muscles[^4]. The session had lasted some 5 to 10 minutes, and nothing irregular had occurred in the session.

### The second individual training session (1st charge – C1)

17     The second session was enormously more consequential, as the events which transpired would form the basis for the first charge. Ms C’s recollection was that this had taken place some one to two weeks from the first session and was likely to have occurred on **_24 February 2013_**. To be clear, Ms C could not be absolutely certain of her ability to recall the precise date. Ms C also could not remember how this second individual training session was arranged by Mr Loh, but believed the mode would have been either by text, voice call or a direct verbal communication to schedule this at a previous training session

18     As was the case with the other sessions, Ms C was unable to recall whether the session had occurred in the morning or the evening. She also could not remember whether there had been other individuals in the stadium premises. Upon the completion of her workout, Mr Loh had again offered to give her the cool down massage and she had agreed.

19     The coach and trainee had proceeded to the same bench where Mr Loh had administered the initial massage at the end of the first individual training session. Ms C had lain in a prone position, with be on her abdomen on the bench with her legs pointed towards the track. She recalled that the wall of the corridor was against the right side of her body. Ms C had placed her arms in a braced position and rested her head resting on her outstretched arms. She recalled that Mr Loh had been on her left and had massaged her with his bare hands from the back of her calves to her thighs. Ms C could feel Mr Loh massage from the bottom of her thigh to the top of her thigh repeatedly. Each time he got to the top of her thigh; Ms C could feel his thumb touching in between her thighs at her vaginal area over her tights. This had occurred multiple times, and she had felt the sensation of a “_brush and rub_” motion from Mr Loh, while his other fingers continued to massage her thigh.

20     Ms C had felt uncomfortable with the contact but had, at that time, reasoned to herself that the contact was probably accidental. She could feel a differential pressure in the contact between the two areas, and contrasted the massage pressure, which entailed his pressing firmly into her skin using a rubbing motion with his **_fingers_**, with the much softer contact pressure imposed by his **_thumb_** when he intruded on her vaginal area with _"just the normal rubbing to loosen your thighs kind of massage"_. Ms C had felt uneasy with the repeated contact between Mr Loh’s thumb and her vaginal area as she sensed that Mr Loh’s “_hand would unnecessarily go so high up and his thumb was just touching… me there multiple times_”, and was concerned that Mr Low had been “_pretending as though_ (this was) _part of the massage_” given the persistent contact.[^5] She recalled that there had been about five intrusions into her vaginal area during the session.

21     Throughout this contact, Ms C had not registered any objection, as she had wanted to believe that the contact was accidental, and that Mr Loh might merely be “_so old and big and clumsy_”[^6]. Ms C had expressed her feelings to be “(d)_efinitely very confused_. _Like … it didn’t feel right_”[^7], particularly over the repeated incidence of intrusion to her clothed vaginal area during the massage. Mr Low had ended the massage on his own accord. After the massage, Ms C packed her belongings, changed out of her training clothes and left the Stadium with Mr Loh.

22     The events of the second individual session had so profoundly bothered Ms C that she confided in her mother[^8], “Ms M” (PW2) that Mr Loh had massaged her after the individual training session to the point that she felt “uncomfortable”, without going into any specific details on what had occurred at the second session. According to her, Ms C’s mother had told her to “_just say no_”[^9] to further massages but Ms C was concerned that Mr Loh would insist and overbear against her resistance. Ms C presumed that her mother had informed her father of her quandary, as her father had accompanied her for her next training session despite Ms C not telling him anything.

### The third individual training session

23     In Ms C’s recollection, the third individual session had occurred some one to two weeks after the second individual training session. Her father; Mr F (PW1) had driven her to the destination, and she had presumed that this had been after her mother had communicated her being “uncomfortable” in relation to having been massaged by Mr Loh. Ms C stated that she had been assured by her father’s presence, as this would ease her declining any overtures to receive a massage. The session, which was again at Tampines Stadium, was interrupted by an episode of rain, which started towards the end of the training session. Ms C did not recall any other trainees during this session, and she recalled that father and Mr Low had been introduced to each other. The session, which simply involved sprints in a sheltered area, was otherwise uneventful, with no massage having taken place. She further recalled that her father had given Mr Loh a lift from the stadium.

### Events relating to the final individual training session (2nd charge – C2)

24     According to Ms C, the final session, from which the second charge was based, had been scheduled after the aforementioned session, where her father was also present. Mr Loh had arranged a final individual training session with her, which took place either in the morning, starting at around 9.00 am to 10.00 am and ending at 11.00 am to 11.30 am, or in the evening starting at around 4.00 pm to 5.00 pm and ending at 6.00 pm - 6.30 pm Ms C recalled that the session involved sprint-related workouts.

25     Ms C’s account was that after the training, she had cooled down and proceeded to retrieve her bag, Mr Loh had again asked to massage her. She recalled saying “no” but he told her “_just massage_” and used a phrase which included “_cool down massage_”[^10]. When she made another bid to decline, Mr Loh persisted and she relented, as she felt that she had to comply because Mr Loh was her coach and “_had authority over her_.”[^11], citing an instance where she had reluctantly complied after he had authoritatively imposed his will for her to drive her back home after a training session despite her wish to linger and chat with her fellow trainees.

### The final massage

26     Ms C was led to an equipment room and made to lie down on the massage bed. Mr Loh massaged her after she assumed the same prone bracing position which she had previously adopted, with her legs facing the door and her head facing a wall several metres away. Ms C also recalled that the door was closed. Mr Loh had positioned himself to her right and started massaging her calves before moving up her thighs, in a matter which was similar to the previous instance, using the fingers on both hands to press into her skin. On this occasion, however, she recalled that Mr Loh’s thumb remained at her vaginal region, and continued rubbing there, up and down over her tights. This was sustained rubbing, and not a touch and release action. Mr Loh had performed this action for some 10 to 15 seconds before she reacted by telling him to “_stop_”. Ms C’s testimony was that Mr Loh had asked her to “_just relax_”.[^12] She then squeezed her thighs together in a bid to “block” his fingers, but felt his thumb or thumbs squeeze in between her crotch. For her account, despite Ms C having “_just tightened_” and “_squeezed_ (her) _thighs together so hard to block his fingers from … having access to wherever he was trying to rub_”. She felt Mr Loh “_forcing his fingers to be there_ … _no matter how hard_ (she) _was trying to squeeze_ (her) _thighs_”[^13] This culminated in what she experienced as a “sick feeling” of being unable to control her body, and that all she could do was to hold the sides of the massage bed to stop herself from moving and wait for the feeling to stop. Ms C who “_didn’t want to show that_ (she) _couldn’t control_ (her) _body_”[^14] had resolved to hold on to the sides of sides of the massage bed. Ms C also described the feeling as wanting to _“explode”[^15]_, and not being able to keep still. There was such a stark degree of escalation in Mr Loh’s actions that Ms C felt that to have been an unmistakable violation of her person. She testified that Mr Loh had been “_really, really forceful_... I _cannot give the benefit of the doubt anymore. It was like the intention was very clear. And I felt very, very dirty, so that’s the difference_.”[^16]

27     I was mindful that Ms C description of what had befallen her was rather idiosyncratic. To afford a better contextual understanding, it should be noted that Ms C, at age 18, was an observant Christian who had attended convent schools, and had no prior sexual experience. Ms C thus came from a relatively sheltered background. I noted that while academically gifted (she had in fact secured a place at the medical faculty in a local university, before choosing to undertake studies in a different discipline), Ms C’s inexperience in such matters was such that she had had required her friend, Mr A, to explain to her that the experience she had described after the second incident was likely a spontaneous orgasm, which is a known physiological reaction.

28     According to Ms C, Mr Loh had eventually stopped his manual actions on his own volition and the two had exited the room. Ms C had taken her bag and gone to the toilet to change. There, she recalled crying as she had felt ‘_gross_’ and ‘_so dirty’_. She stated that she had felt very, very confused, with her body (knowing) that something was wrong but her mind being unable to accept that it actually happened, as she had looked up to and trusted Mr Loh[^17].

29     After Ms C emerged from the toilet, she found Mr Low acting as if nothing extraordinary had happened. He proposed that they share a meal, which she acceded. The two proceeded to a _Han’s_ restaurant at Tampines. Ms C asserted that she shared the meal as she had wished to pretend that nothing had happened and having a meal was an affirmation of normality. Thereafter Ms C attended only group trainings, and finally ceased all contact with him in 2014.

## NEAR-CONTEMPORANEOUS COMMUNICATIONS WITH WITNESSES PW 4 (MS W) AND PW5 (MR A)

### Exchange of text messages with Ms W

30     The Prosecution had presented sets of near-contemporaneous communications as corroborative evidence of the alleged acts of molestation. The most cogent being a chain of _WhatsApp_ messages between Ms C and Ms W, on **17 March 2013** at 11.36 pm. Ms W (PW4), was a principal witness, and also the complainant in relation to three other stood-down charges of molestation against Mr Loh

31     The chain of messages had commenced with Ms C texting her friend and training partner, Ms W (PW4), where she had in seeking to ascertain the venue of the next group training session, also asked Ms W not to leave her to train alone with Mr Loh and that (in her own words) “**_I rily don’t like it when he massage, feels like he’s molesting me or smth, kept rubbing my groin_**[^18]. Ms W’s reply, as documented by the image taken from the _WhatsApp_ chat was to express her belief that the training session would be held in Bishan stadium. Critically, Ms W had also added “**_Rly_**? **_Kinda felt the same way too like weird_**”, hinting that she had also been subject to a similar experience. There had been a further exchange in the _WhatsApp_ chat on 18 April 2013 at 1.01 pm, where Ms C had responded **_“Yeah, damn weird okay see you lte”[^19]_**

### In person discussion with Ms W

32     In her court testimony. Ms C recalled following through to speak with Ms W at the scheduled group training the day after the messages were exchanged; on 18 March 2013, where she had told Ms W while they were changing out of their tights that she had been “(b)_etrayed at Tampines yesterday’_, and that Mr Loh had “_wanted to message and then he just kept rubbing_ (her) _groin there until_ (she) _got that weird feeling_.” According to Ms C, Ms W had been succinct in stating “_Same_” and “_Yah, lor_” in what she understood to be allusions to having undergone the same, without offering any elaboration.[^20]

33     Mr C’s recollection was there had been “_a lot more to say”_ at her face-to-face encounter with Ms W but she could no longer “_remember what exactly_”[^21] had been said. The complainant had felt conflicted as she did not “_know how to react_” but also felt an anger that she had had to “_just continue_ (to put up a front) j_ust like training as though nothing_ (had) _happened_”[^22]. Ms C indicated that despite trying to block out the experiences as a coping mechanism, she was nevertheless deeply emotionally and psychologically affected. In her own words[^23]:

> I didn’t know what to do … so I just acted normal and spend that whole week crying, okay? It was so gross. I felt so dirty.

### Disclosure to confidante Mr A (PW5)

34     Some two weeks later, on 30 March 2013, Ms C had texted her close friend and senior in Junior College, Mr A (PW5), where she had stated **_“I think Mr. Loh molested me, idk”[^24]_**, with the term “idk” to pertain to the phrase “_I don’t know_” signalling her sense of confusion, tentativeness, and uncertainty as to what to make of her situation. For context, Mr A had first revealed his own emergent acceptance of his own homosexual orientation, and plan to “_come out_” to publicly be known to be so inclined, starting to confide with his expressing “_Haha, I’m dreading. I’m so looking to the day I am able to tell_”[^25]. After Mr A extended his warm wishes that she would soon become a national athlete, Ms C had felt a reciprocal desire to text him that she had something she had been keeping from him. The salient part of the _WhatsApp_ exchange fragment is as follows[^26]:

>   
| 

Ms C:

 | 

Oh and about that, I have smth I’ve been keeping too

 |
| 

Mr A:

 | 

Wassup

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

I don’t think you can help me anw

**_I think Mr. Loh molested me, idk_**

Like I asked (Ms W) and she said that she felt the same thing but she didn’t tell anyone.

 |
| 

Mr A:

 | 

Huh what did he do!!

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

Kept rubbing my groin, until I got that weird feeling

 |
| 

Mr A:

 | 

Why did he rub your groin?

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

**_And it’s always like in a room alone and I told him to stop but he went like just relax_**

Yah exactly, I don’t know why

Then I felt damn weird for a week, but if you don’t think about it, you slowly forget it so

 |
| 

 | 

\[Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

### Encouragement by Mr A to act against the accused

35     The subsequent text massages do show Mr A taking a major role in persuading Ms C to call attention to what she claimed had happened. His message was that if she failed to do anything about that, nothing was going to change, and that future acts of molestation “_might get worse_”. The messages state[^27]:

>   
| 

Mr A:

 | 

What…Dude that’s not cool at all.

How can you just ignore it.

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

Idk

 |
| 

Mr A:

 | 

(Ms W) has exactly the same experience?

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

Cos I feel damn gross thinking about it.

Yeah.

Like you get the feeling he is a pervert or smth.

Idkkkk

 |
| 

Mr A**_:_**

 | 

**_If you don’t do anything abt it, nth’s gna change…._**

**_And it might get worse._**

 |
| 

 | 

\[Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

36     Mr A goes on to directly admonish her to for trying to “_behave normal like nth_ (i.e.: nothing) _happened”_. The messages continue as follows[^28]:

>   
| 

Ms C:

 | 

I was thinking the next time just say idw.

**_Yeah it kinda got worse, like first few times, he just touched._**

 |
| 

Mr A :

 | 

…And you all can still behave like nth happened?!

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

Smth like that.

 |
| 

Mr A:

 | 

Don’t you plan to stop it

I mean just tell him you don’t want yeah you definitely should…

**_If he doesn’t listen then it’s time to seek help seriously_**.

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

Yeah was planning to.

 |
| 

Mr A:

 | 

So not cool to have a pervy coach.

Ms C:

 | 

(Ms W) **_ttly did nth, she just ignored it._**

**_That’s why, I keep not wanting to think he’s bad._**

 |
| 

Mr A:

 | 

If intentional then yes he’s bad.

 |

37     In the text massage reproduced above that “**_Yeah it kinda got worse, like first few times, he just touched”[^29]_**, Ms C clarified in her court testimony that she was referring to the **_escalation_** of the degree of molestation in the final occasion, and “_the first few times_”[^30] The latter was a verbally loose reference which was meant to describe events that had transpired at the singular event of the second training session, rather than multiple occasions. Mr A probed further in the latter part of their _WhatsApp_ exchange, and challenged Ms C’s reticence to act: At this point, Mr A had proposed starting with obtaining a discreet clarification about the nature and intended purpose of the “massage’ which had been administered to Ms C [^31]:

>   
| 

Mr A:

 | 

It’s not right

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

Yeah I can tell, damn that’s why you just gotta not think about it.

 |
| 

Mr A:

 | 

**_Ask him._**

**_Confront the matter don’t ignore it._**

**_It’ll only benefit him if y’all are not doing anything abt it_**

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

Omg I can’t just go like…

 |
| 

Mr A:

 | 

I mean ask him what does it do. Like maybe it’s a massage or smth. Ask discreetly.

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

I wanted to tell ms eng but I nvr got to see her then quite weird to tell her that her coach’s like sick.

**_I won’t dare_**, (expletive) **_I’m gna be another_** (Ms W)

 |
| 

Mr A:

 | 

Then ask ms eng

 |
| 

Ms C

 | 

Yeah probably

 |
| 

Mr A:

 | 

**_Don’t probably me. Do it._**

**_Or I’ll ask for you._**

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

Eh (expletive) wait. I’ll do it when I see her.

 |
| 

Mr A:

 | 

Ehhhh and so you hope he’ll stop rubbing you sooooon.

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

No it’s not regular, that’s why it’s easy to forget. Like I know he won’t be wanting me to massage me anytime soon.

 |
| 

Mr A:

 | 

**_Aren’t you apprehensive of every trng session then_**

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

**_Nope, cos he only does it when I train alone w him, at tampines, so I just avoid him then I’m safe_**.

## INTERIM ANALYSIS

38     As a ‘pitstop’ analysis to take stock of this aspect of the evidence presented, I would observe that the _WhatsApp_ messages between Ms C and Mr A on 30 March 2013, just two weeks from the date of the final episode of molestation, do cohere entirely with the complainant’s account of the setting. Ms C had described the outrages of modesty to have taken place at **_individual_** training sessions, in **_Tampines_** Stadium, and expressed her confidence that she was safe if she did not train alone with Mr Loh. This was contrary of course to the accused’s case that he had never scheduled any individual sessions with Ms C. It is also important to note Ms C’s clear reticence in making the revelations to both Ms W and Mr A. With Ms W, she had started merely with a plea not to be left alone with Mr Loh during training sessions. With Mr A, Ms C had only made the disclosure during a deeply personal sharing of matters which had caused angst to the respective persons. Even after her unburdening to Mr A, it was clear that Ms C was extremely reluctant to even confront Mr Loh, much less make any police report, or even official complaint, about his conduct during the two sessions.

39     The messages showed that Ms C had considerable difficulty in coming to terms with the acts that she asserted had happened within the background of their coach-trainee relationship. The complainant was apparently processing her clearly conflicted feelings when she texted Mr A that “**_I keep not wanting to think he’s bad”_**.[^32] At trial, she confirmed this view by explaining that she had not wished to regard the accused as a sexual offender and wanted him to still be that coach that she looked up to and respected and trusted. In the later messages, Ms C had texted Mr A and stated that she feared being unable to muster the resolve to stand up for herself (“_I won’t dare_”), and ruefully texted him that she was ‘**_gonna_** (abbreviated as “gna” in the text) **_be another_** (Ms W)’. In her court testimony, she had explained her discomfiture with what she perceived to be Ms W’s pliancy as a victim, who had not stood up for herself, confronted the offender or done anything about her own alleged molestation[^33]. The evidence thus showed Ms C’s motivation to hold Mr Loh to account to be in part fuelled by her frustration at Ms W’s taciturn and tentative stance despite her own claimed molestation. While the defence would later attempt to argue that the allegations of molest were baseless and contrived wholly out of spite due to Ms C’s failure to attain good progress in her athletic endeavours, the text messages reveal quite a different set of motivations at work. The messages show a nuanced yet steady progression on the path of Ms C ultimately choosing to make known the acts of molestation allegedly committed by Mr Loh, where Ms C had initially exhibited considerable discomfiture and reticence in both sets of revelations to Ms W, on 18 March 2013. and Mr A, on 30 March 2013 to discuss what she had experienced. The messages set out above show the **_evolution_** of Ms C’s motivation from initial reluctance and avoidance, to, after a course of patient but persistent **_moral suasion_** from Mr A to metaphorically ‘_do the right thing_’, developing a sense that it was incumbent on her to stand up for herself. Mr A had also, in a subsequent face-to-face meeting on an occasion she recalled being a ‘tree-top walk’, told her that the ‘_weird feeling_’ she had described in her text was probably an orgasm, and explaining to her that “_this whole feeling is what you get when you have sex_”. [^34]

### Mr A’s pro-active reaching out to school coach Ms Michelle Eng (DW5)

40     As can be seen from the _WhatsApp_ chain, Mr A had advised her to either confront the accused or tell Ms Michelle Eng, the coach who had referred her to Mr Loh. According to Ms C, Mr A had gone on approach Ms Eng on his own. He had not revealed what Ms C had shared with him, but merely told Ms Eng that Ms C “_had something to share with her_”.[^35] Mr A had not prompted Ms C of what he had told Ms Eng. Ms C was thus surprised to be approached by Ms Eng during the National Schools Championship in 2013, when she had attended the event to support the juniors in her school.

### Initial meeting with Ms Eng

41     Ms Eng had been at the National Schools Championship event as the track teacher in charge of Ms C’s _alma mater_. She had queried “(Ms C), (Mr A) _says you have something to tell me._” Ms C had been taken by surprise and sought a sufficiently discreet and private venue to tell Ms Eng that “_Mr Loh massaged me until like I_ (felt) _very uncomfortable_”.[^36] When Ms Eng enquired when this had happened, Ms C had stated “(W)_henever I train with him alone_.” When Ms Eng asked, “_Like where did he touch_?”. Ms C had been tentative and begun with “(W)_ell, my legs_” and did not give any more explicit details, as she had been deterred by Ms Eng adroitly and staunchly defending the accused upon the beginning of her overture. In this regard, Ms C had recalled Ms Eng suggesting that the contact had likely been “_not on purpose_” and had reassured her that Mr Loh “_really has that bond with you and maybe he just overstepped his position_”. She had also speculated that “_maybe he’s so old that he doesn’t understand what the comfort level of a massage should be_”[^37]. Ms C did not proceed beyond this attenuated account she had given before Ms Eng’s peremptory downplaying and dismissal of her complaint. She had eschewed from rendering a more detailed disclosure on that occasion, as she perceived Ms Eng’s apparent defensiveness in issues connected to Mr Loh, had been the result of the long-shared personal history between the two.

### Detailed message to DW 5; Michelle Eng

42     Matters had lain dormant between 2013 and June 2016, when Ms C had felt constrained to again approach Ms Eng. The trigger precipitating this disclosure had been documented in a message she had sent to Ms W on 2 June 2016 at 4.23 pm, where she had reported to Ms W of having spoken to Ms Michelle Eng upon concerns that a new batch of promising female trainees had been sent to Mr Loh for training. Ms C had accordingly felt duty-bound to ensure that other trainees would not have to undergo their alleged experiences in Mr Loh’s hands. In her own words, Ms C stated had “_this batch has many rlly fast girls and I was scared that she’d send them to him_.”[^38]

43     Prior to sending the message to Ms W, Ms C had on 2 June 2016 at 3.52 pm, texted Ms Eng to give a more fully fleshed out account of what had transpired between Mr Loh and her during the individual sessions[^39]. Ms C states (reproduction in verbatim and uncorrected):

> Hi ms eng, can I be rily honest w you. Rmb last time I told you mr Low massaged me and made me uncomfortable, I didn’t rily tell you what exactly happened. **_He kinda made me train individually with him on three occasions and kept massaging me further and further up my thighs, in this equipment room behind the spectator stands and eventually he rubbed me down there. And I was scared and I didn’t know what to do and I said stop but he just told me to relax. And I tried closing my thighs tight but he kept rubbing me until I came and I didn’t know what an orgasm was and how wrong it was until_** (Mr A) **_tried explaining to me and told me to quit._** I think I just spent rily long crying and feeling very dirty but when I tried to explain to you that time I didn’t dare say it. I told (Ms W) what had happened and she told me he did the same to me too when she continued training with him after graduating from (_name of school_) but she just tried to forget about it. That’s kinda why I stopped running and she stopped training under him, I’m scared you’ll send the juniors to train under him when they graduate so just letting you know.

> Ms C acknowledged Ms Eng’s deep regard for Mr Loh, and in response to her queries stated:

>> I didn’t wna tell you cos I know how much you respect him,

>> I treated him like a dad too.

>> And no it’s rilly not your fault at all!

>> He was good at track but maybe not so much as a person

>> He did not remove anything I was wearing tights

44     In the messages, Ms C stressed that her primary concern in resurrecting a series of events that had occurred three years before was not personal vindication, but rather, her concern that that Ms Eng might unwittingly send juniors of her _alma mater_ to train under Mr Loh as private trainees, unaffiliated to any school, after they graduated. In her court testimony, she noted that her female Junior College juniors were performing well, and she believed that after the ‘A’ Levels Ms Eng might have been inclined to also dispatch them to train under Mr Loh. She asserted that she would have felt bad if she did not do anything and “_something happened_”. Ms C had in the course of the long chain also updated Ms W of her action of informing Ms Eng. It is notable that she was completely _au fait_ with the slate of athletes who were training with Mr Loh (and their general high regard for him), as demonstrated in her ability to name the involved athletes in the text. Neither had taken any further action until a newspaper article changed the course of events.

### Ms C informed Ms Eng on her own without giving Ms W prior notice of her intended course of action

45     There was, in my view, a ring of authenticity in the messages between Ms C and Ms W. Significantly, the messages showed that Ms C had **_acted_** to give Ms Eng the full account of what had transpired between her (Ms C) and Mr Loh **_without_** giving Ms W any forewarning that she would do so. Indeed, the messages showed that Ms C had been concerned that Ms W might disapprove of her approaching Ms Eng directly. The chain of _WhatsApp_ messages includes Ms C asking Ms W “_Are you mad at me for telling her?_” (i.e. Ms Eng).[^40] In her court testimony, Ms C stated that she had been aware of the close relationship between Ms W and Ms Eng as the two had trained together, and that they had a far deeper connection, rather than the superficial student-teacher relationship that Ms C herself had with Ms Eng[^41]. She had perceived that Ms W “_never really wanted me to tell Ms Eng because_ (it was) _just awkward for her_”, which led her to proceed to approach Ms Eng on her own. Ms W had indicated that she was not upset with Ms C for proceeding unilaterally. Ms W also ventured that Ms C and Mr Loh were “very close”, leading to Ms C’s response to explain that that was the precise reason she had not previously given a complete disclosure. Ms W had reaffirmed that she was “OK” and seemed more interested to know “(w)_as she shocked_ ”?[^42]

### The WhatsApp communications appear genuine and would have been exceedingly difficult to fabricate

46     The point I would wish to demonstrate in setting out the above exchange is that Ms C’s account was complete and fully textured account, where she was able to explain the **_intricate relational dynamics_**, and how they had influenced her actions. It is also significant to note that Ms C and Ms W did not see eye-to-eye in everything, with Ms C being resolutely pro-active in ‘a_cting first and apologising later_’ (in contacting Ms Eng) even as she anticipated that the more timorous Ms W would come to accept her course of action. In my view, it would be **_extremely difficult_** to **_fabricate_** such a nuanced and detailed set of communications between Ms C and Ms W. The same would of course also hold true for the prior messages between Mr A and Ms C, where he is seen to steel Ms C’s resolve to approach Ms Eng to report her alleged molestation by Mr Loh. More importantly, this is consistent with the ground facts of what had actually occurred, since the meeting in 2013 between Ms C and Ms Eng is referenced in Ms C’s text to Ms Eng. There is nothing in Ms Eng’s responses on 2 June 2016 to suggest that she did not recall Ms C’s initial overture to confide with her in 2013.

### Chain of events leading to the filing of the police report

47     The chain of events leading to the filing of the police report began in the morning of 24 June 2016, when Ms C messaged Ms W that Mr A had sent an image of a news report with headline “**_Athletics Coach Suspended_**” and forwarded the report to Ms W[^43]. After Ms W had indicated that she was unaware who the coach might be, Ms C had then called the Singapore Athletic Association to inquire over the identity of the implicated coach. Ms C’s intent was to find out if Mr Loh was indeed the coach in the news reportage and had been minded to step forward if others had made similar accusations of sexual misconduct. In her own words: “I _just thought like if it’s him then then we can do something about it, you know, like maybe some people actually stood forward first so like, so much easier to say that it also happened_…”[^44]

48     Ms C eventually discovered that the implicated coach had been involved in weight training in a gym, and was thus not likely to be Mr Loh, whom the two understood to never use a gym but invariably trained in open-air stadia. Ms C and Ms W then engaged in a frenetic extended discussion[^45] over _WhatsApp_ chat on whether to reveal the alleged acts of sexual conduct. Ms W had been rueful that they had never filed a “_complaint or anything_”[^46]. Ms C’s immediate rejoinder was “_Yeahh_”, “_I might_” and “_Later_”.

49     Ms W’s response was to inquire whether Ms C was serious, where she had posted a single word response “_legit_” in challenge. Ms C tentative tone had been evident in her three answering messages “_Haha_”, “_Scared_” and “_Just see how idkkk_’. These were all posted within two minutes[^47], and suggested a _melange_ of mixed feelings. The first appeared to be a response to Ms W’s challenge if she was ‘_legitimate_’ in respect of her stated intent to proceed with a complaint against the accused, the second seemed a reflection of fear or uncertainty on how their belated complaint would be received, and the third pointed to a return of resolve, softened by her “_idkkk_”, as in an abbreviated ‘_I don’t know_’ accented with an repeat-letter emphasis, presumably showed a continued contemplation on the option of proceeding.

50     Ms W remained was uncertain as to whether the course was viable responding “_But it’s too long ago_”. Ms C had conceded “_My friend last time kept saying why didn’t we just immediately go to the police_” and “_I also dk_”. What is notable is that while Ms W remained riven with doubt and fainthearted on the prospects of a late report of molestation, Ms C seemed from the trend of her messages to be gathering momentum to steel her resolve to act. Some two and a half hours after the above set of messages, Ms C posted that she **_had_** indeed made inquiries with the Singapore Athletic Association and confirmed that the offender in the news report was not Mr Loh. Ms W had responded with incredulity that Ms C had asked stating: “ _U asked if its mr Loh???”, “omgg meaning the person will like suspect Loh got do sth like that b4_”.[^48] In that instance, Ms C revealed that she had not given her name to the SAA member who had received her inquiry.

51     The final set of messages show the dynamics alluded to above at work, with Ms C demonstrating her strong conviction to act, and winning over the more cautious Ms W:

>   
| 

Ms C:

 | 

Why you don’t want people to know and take action

 |
| 

Ms W:

 | 

Hmmm, But do u think taking action Nw is too late?

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

I know

 |
| 

Ms W:

 | 

Some of my mates know alr though,

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

**_But I feel it’s good to know and prevent anything more from happening_**

**_Like no need to take action to find justice for us_**

**_Or well that would be good but it is too late_**

**_But more to prevent_**

 |
| 

Ms W:

 | 

Yeah,

True

But how do we do that?

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

**_I’ll feel rily bad if other ppl experience and I’ll feel it’s my fault I guess._**

 |
| 

\[Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

52     In short, Ms C ultimately won the argument that while there was “**_no need to take action to find justice for_** (Ms C and Ms W)”, as that **_“_**_would be good but it is too late_**_”._** Ms C’s primary motivation would be to **_prevent_**”[^49] this from happening again. Ms C’s plan of action had started with her inquiry in the morning after her message to Ms W at 9.34 am. She had called the Singapore Athletic Association and generally inquired on the identity of the implicated coach. The representative who picked up the call had declined to name the coach indicating that “_he cannot say_”[^50] Ms C had then asked point blank “_Is it Mr Loh_?” The representative, whom she recalled having identified himself as ‘Jamie’, had replied in the negative, but then inquired why she had named Mr Loh. Ms C had then “_said out everything to him in the hopes that this would be enough_” and would be “_the only thing that_ (she) _had to do_”. She had then related Mr Loh’s alleged acts of molestation, stating that he had “_massaged_ (her) _groin_”, and that “_it didn’t only happen to me but it also happen to my friend_”.[^51] ‘Jamie’ had asked her to make a formal written complaint to the Singapore Athletic Association through e-mail.

53     While initially deterred from reporting as she was uncertain, Ms C finally resolved to make a report in the afternoon of 30 July 2016. Ms C had told her mother of her plan but not her father. Ms C indicated that this was because she was closer to her mother and found it relatively more difficult to communicate with her father, as he was hard of hearing and their “_personalities_ (didn’t) _match_”.[^52] This had subsequently become a source of friction, as Ms C’s father had strongly disapproved of her course of action in making a police report. Ms C described an angry confrontation between the two at her campus shortly after he became aware that she had made such a report. Mr F had contended that his daughter had “_no right to lodge a police report_” without telling him as this was a “_selfish_” act which failed to consider the impact on the family.[^53] Ms C had rebutted her father and accused him of failing to ask her what had happened. I will delve further into the dynamics of Ms C’s relationship with respective family members who offered their testimonies (her mother; Ms M and her father; Mr F) in a later part of these grounds, as this is highly relevant in assessing the quality of their evidence, especially in the areas of cogency and objectivity.

### The circumstances disclosed in the WhatsApp messages do not suggest any closely premeditated plot to frame the accused

54     In my interim analysis, I made the point that it would have been extremely difficult to fabricate the email chain reproduced in the preceding paragraphs. This would require the collusion of Ms C, Ms W and Mr A in development of a script and then to place this _WhatsApp_ trail into “i_ncubation_” for more three years to wait for an opportune moment to “_hatch”_ the plot. Even more implausibly, this scheme would have included the peripheral involvement of Ms Eng, who would have to be given some sense of Ms C’s accusation as far back as 2013.

55     In setting out of the series of posts of the events leading to the police report, it seemed evident that the decision to finally make a report, some three years and four months after the events in February to March 2013, seemed to have been **_precipitated_** from an **_external_** development (in the form of the newspaper report), rather than any closely planned decision to bring the accusations to light after a period of dormancy. As was the case in his approaching Mr Eng directly to create the impetus for Ms C’s revelation to Ms Eng, Mr A was again the person who revived the dormant matter, bringing it back to life by forwarding the newspaper report to Ms C. Mr A could not have anticipated in advance that this singular act would have triggered an intense discussion on the viability of resurrecting an allegation which the three had kept to themselves. The text discussions had shown the continued angst between Ms C and Ms W in relation to their experiences, reflected their uncertainty as to whether they would be believed if they had gone ahead, and culminated in Ms C actually being motivated to take a step to come forward. These sheer breadth and depth of their discussions lend to a sense of authenticity, as this set of messages in 2016 would be as difficult to see as a fabrication to frame Mr Loh, as were the earlier messages in 2013. In this regard, I would note that Ms C has not eschewed from using an expletive against Mr Loh in a text “_Like f him_”[^54]. This would, in my judgment, militate against the proposition that the text was crafted for third parties to read. Ms C would have been expected to **_sanitise_** her language and avoid vulgar vituperation in such circumstances.

## EVIDENCE OF CORROBORATING PROSECUTION WITNESSES

### Evidence of PW 1; father of complainant

56     PW1; Ms C’s father, (“Mr F”) gave testimony in **_two_** aspects which would be significant in the proceedings. The first was in relation to his encounter with Mr Loh at an individual training session, which the prosecution contends to be the third individual session described by Ms C, where no molestation had taken place. To recap Ms C’s impression was that her mother had instigated her father to bring her to the session after she described her discomfiture with events that had occurred at the second session. The second aspect of significance was in what had been stated at the point of her revelation to her father of her molestation.

57     Mr F gave testimony that he had been present at an **_individual_** training session between Ms C and Mr Loh at Tampines Stadium. Mr F could not pin-point the date but recalled it had been “_between December 2012 and April 2013_”.[^55] When Mr Loh had arrived, Mr F recalled saying “_hello_”, shaking Mr Loh’s hand and exchanging pleasantries. Mr F was certain that this had been the **_only_** trainee had been his daughter and that he had not discerned the presence of any other trainees[^56]at that session. Mr F’s account cohered with Ms C’s account of the third individual training session. It was also significant that Mr F indicated that the session had been affected by an episode of rain, which corroborated Ms C’s account. Mr F had noted that it had begun to rain when Mr Loh had arrived at the Tampines Stadium, and the training had been conducted at a concrete slab at the grandstand of the stadium. Mr F could see the accused “_advising her_” as the session went on, and he could see his daughter running up and down the concrete slabs of the sheltered area of Tampines Stadium. According to Mr F, he had been sitting at a corner at the spectator stand and had a “_full view_”[^57] of the proceedings. Mr F could not hear the specific instructions as he was a distance away. He recalled that the rain had necessitated the truncation of the training session, which wound down after some 30 minutes. Mr F recalled sending Mr Loh back home his residence at Pasir Ris. As F was unfamiliar with the precincts of Pasir Ris, Mr Loh had directed the way. Other than the provision of directions to assist in navigating the route from Tampines Stadium to Mr Loh’s residence at Pasir Ris, the father indicated that “_nothing much_” had been said in the car. Mr F had recalled that Mr Loh occupied the front seat, and his daughter had been seated at the rear. Mr F’s evidence is significant given his clear recall of such an event, against Mr Loh’s adamant stance that no individual training ever occurred and that he had never met Mr F on a one-to-one basis in any similar circumstances.

### PW1’s incorrect recall that he had accompanied Ms C on a weekday

58     I should nevertheless give a caveat of there being a problem with Mr F’s account in that the encounter with Mr Loh had occurred on **_weekday_** where the duo had gone to Tampines Stadium at or about 10.00 a.m. on that day. This is plainly a **_mistake_** and contrary to **_both_** the prosecutions and defence’s case. Mr Loh’s own case has it that he only trained private athletes (i.e. those unaffiliated to any school or institution of higher learning), albeit in a group setting, from Mondays to Fridays between 5.30 to 7. 30 pm and on Saturday mornings from 8.30 to 1030 am. No morning trainings would be organised on weekdays for his cadre of private athletes. In the same vein, Ms C attested to be **_working_** on **_weekdays_** in her internship programme which spanned January to April 2013, and she would only attend evening trainings after the workday. There is thus a consensus that Mr F’s recollection of the encounter occurring on a **_weekday_** is faulty in this regard.

### Possible reason for Mr F’s conflation

59     While neither prosecution nor defence has advanced any reason for this lapse, I would wonder if Mr F had excluded the possibility of the encounter occurring on a Sunday, as he would ordinarily go for a church service for the morning service which extended from 8.30-9.30 am. Using his routine as a mnemonic, he might have forgotten that his bringing Ms C for training (where they had departed for the destination at 10.00 am) had been an **_exceptional_** occurrence and a break from this routine. Ms C’s mother, Ms M had distinctly recalled a singular instance that Ms C had asked Mr F in an instance “_Papa, can you go with me to the track_,” and was certain that Ms C “_really asked the dad to follow her to the track_.”[^58] She had found this request to be quite atypical as Ms C would normally ask to be dropped off at most, and not to be accompanied throughout. My belief is that Mr F had based his recollection that the meeting with Mr Loh had been on a weekday as he would have expected to find himself in church on a Sunday morning. I would again reiterate that his sense of time was inexact, given that he could only recall the encounter to have occurred between December 2012 and April 2013. In fairness, some five years would have elapsed at the time Mr F gave his evidence in January 2018,

### PW1 was not eager for police action to be taken against the accused

60     The other aspect of Mr F’s evidence which had direct relevance to the case was his account of the revelation by his daughter of her alleged molestation, and the strong disagreement which had erupted as a result of his reaction. Mr F had been surprised when his daughter had opened up about her alleged assault, as his impression had been that Ms C held Mr Loh in high regard “_as far as training is concerned. But she did not speak much about him._”[^59] When she had spoken on this, Mr F stated that his daughter “_did share with me very briefly_” what had happened. Mr F had been “_a bit reluctant_” that the matter had been escalated for police action. He had thus suggested a reversal of this course as this seemed a “_a one-off situation whereby I advised her that we should perhaps just forgive him and just move on_”, Ms C had not taken his counsel to ‘forgive and move on’ well as she had gone to greater detail and revealed to Mr F:[^60]

> Pa, you … do not know that what he did to me, I experience orgasm.

61     As an indication of Mr F’s deeply conservative background and tendency not to discuss matters of a sexual nature with his daughter, he had confessed to being “_quite surprised for her to have said that to me because that’s a language that father and daughter do not speak that kind of language_”[^61] Despite being “_taken aback_” but this revelation, Mr F was, to say the least, **_not supportive_** of Ms C’s having gone ahead to involve the police in the matter. He was extremely candid in this regard and stated, “_I even told the investigation officer initially that I was … bit hesitant …I didn’t want to get involved_”, and his approach was to “_forgive that man_”. He had eventually allowed himself to be persuaded to offer his testimony, and “_went along_” because of his care for his daughter and urge to “_give her the… confidence_,” and assured that “_in short, I came here to speak the truth_”.[^62]

### Quality of PW1’s evidence

62     Mr F impressed me as a forthright person of rectitude and deep spiritual convictions, who had been prepared to advocate there to be a measure of redemptive value in forgiving Mr Loh, at the risk of antagonising his daughter. His aversion to the notion of police action had led to a confrontation with his daughter, as described earlier in these grounds[^63]. Ultimately, I was convinced that Mr F was a truthful witness, despite his lapsed recall of the time of his meeting with the accused at Tampines Stadium. Despite being Ms C’s father, he seemed scrupulously non-partisan and displayed no apparent rancour against Mr Loh while giving his evidence. While he had little enthusiasm for the course of police action being taken by Ms C, and the consequential need for him to give evidence, I am satisfied that Mr F gave as comprehensive as account as he could, notwithstanding the limitations imposed by his restricted contextual understanding (as a result of Ms C being wont to confide in her mother rather than her father, whom she regarded as more emotionally distant) and the fact that half a decade had passed at the time he offered his testimony.

### Evidence of PW2, mother of complainant

63     The second prosecution witness (PW2) was Ms C’s mother (Ms M). Her evidence was significant for the prosecution in two areas. The first being her corroboration that her husband; Mr F, had indeed been asked to accompany Ms C on a training session with Mr Loh, and the second being her recollection of what Ms C had told her about the alleged acts of sexual assault.

64     On the first, Ms M **_did_** recall Mr F being asked by Ms C to accompany her for the training session at Tampines Stadium. Notably she did not recall being the one who had instigated the accompaniment, which had been Ms C’s impression. To recap, Ms C had stated that it was that her mother had asked her father to accompany her to the third individual training session, after Ms C’s expression of discomfiture after the second session to her mother[^64]:

> Q    Did you or your mum ask for your dad to drive you?

> A    Oh, definitely my mum asked my dad.

> Q    Are you very sure about that?

> A    Yup.

> Q    And you are not guessing, are you?

> A    No, I know I only told my mum and my mum was the one that suggested that my dad join me.

65     Ms M’s recollection was limited and she could only recapitulate the details after her daughter had jotted her memory at the time Ms C filed the police report. She recalled that Ms C had not referenced being molested at the time, but she had rationalised that her daughter had been “_a child_” and she thought Ms C had “_just want_(ed) _somebody to be there to protect” adding_[^65].

> …But I suppose she’s still, at that time, not able to express and tell that “somebody has touched me the wrong part”. So I think that … was in her and I think she has kept it for many, many years. And I think it’s also good that she let go.

66     Ms M’s evidence was that Ms C had communicated her plan abruptly on a Friday night of a date she could no longer recall, by stating “_Mummy, I am going to make a police report with another friend_”,[^66] revealing that friend to be Ms W. Ms C had unburdened herself stating that “_she kept it all this while_” and expressed her view that her daughter might have been too shy or youthful to summon the gumption to report earlier. The complainant had been 18 at the time of the alleged offences, and 22 at the time she spoke to her mother. Ms C indicated that she had already arranged with her to make a police report the next day and identified Mr Loh as the perpetrator of the offences against herself and Ms W.

67     Ms M had, as her mother, been concerned to ensure that Ms C understood all the ramifications of her intended course of action. Ms M told her daughter that she had to ensure that was very sure that she had the wherewithal to what was to come as a consequence of so proceeding, that she would have to co-operate in investigative processes and be called to give her evidence in court, stating “_The police will be calling you up every now and then… probably, if you are going to work or you have school on, you will have to miss lessons, you have to skip your job at times_.”[^67] She had asked “(a)_re you ready for that?_” She testified that her daughter had stated “_For the rest of the young girls, I will want to go for it_. _I don’t want him to go and do it to other girls anymore_…_what he has done to me_”[^68] Ms M elaborated that her daughter had reiterated: “(h)_er reasoning is that “he had done it to us”, and there is also a possibility that he had done it to other girls too. And in order to stop this going on, she wants to make a police report._”[^69]

68     Ms M had lent her unqualified support after she heard her daughter’s account. Ms C had reportedly stated “_Do you know that he actually …touched the vagina and actually did something that triggers me?_” [^70] Ms C had also told her mother that what she was aware that she had experienced was an orgasm, and indicated that “_Mummy, I just realised it. Because during the younger days, I may not have understood what it was._”[^71]. Ms C had not given any further details, but Ms W had then become fully motivated to tell her daughter to proceed to make the police report, with a promise to “_back_ (her) _up all the way through_.”

69     Unlike her husband, who was notably deliberate and dispassionate in giving his testimony, Ms C spoke in rapid effusive bursts which took on a more vehement and emotionally emphatic tone, as can be seen in this passage (Ms M refers to “_My girls_” as she has several daughters including one with special needs) [^72]:

> Of course I believe her. My girls will always tell me the truth. But as what I mentioned, when she was younger, maybe she doesn’t know how to put it up. So that was why I---I felt. I mean, that’s my personal opinion. I felt that she may have kept it in her heart for so long and I think, finally, she said this is time to put up a report and be---be very certain that she will actually protect all these young trackers who are also running and also under Mr Loh. You never know what could have been done.

### Quality of PW2’s testimony

70     Despite the identified propensities, there was nothing to suggest that Ms M was anyone less than an honest or forthright witness or had embellished her evidence in any way. Indeed the discrepancy in Ms C’s belief that her mother had arranged for her father to accompany her to the third training session and Ms M’s inability to recall this detail strongly suggested that all three family members; Ms C, Mr F and Mr M, had all given their testimonies **_independently_**, and eschewed from discussing their respective accounts among each other, or otherwise colluding to render accounts of ‘_picture-perfect_’ consistency, since it would have been patently anticipable that all three would have been examined on that detail at trial. I also of the belief that Ms C rendered the more **_accurate_** version. Nevertheless, I would not fault Ms M for her inability to recall, given the effluxion of time between February 2013 and July 2016, with the tendency of memories to fade, or even firmly encode in Ms M’s consciousness in the first place if she failed to appreciate the significance of the information relayed by her daughter. This would be especially where Ms C had, at the time, mentioned an unparticularised discomfiture being alone with Mr Loh, rather than an inevitably more **_attention-inducing_** disclosure that her intimate parts had been intruded into by Mr Loh at the second training session. Ultimately, the essential fact, in my judgment, is that, despite the variations described above, all three are _ad idem_ that Mr F had indeed accompanied Ms C to Tampines Stadium for an individual training session. Ms C and Mr F; the two family members actually present, were also able to give generally consistent accounts of that event, which the accused claims never occurred.

### Evidence of PW4

71     PW4; Ms W, was the accuser in three separate stood down charges, had been an important witness for the prosecution’s case in parsing out essential contextual details such as the training accorded to both group and individual trainings. Ms W indicated that there was a range of venues for group trainings, which included CHIJ Toa Payoh, Catholic Junior College, Bishan Stadium, Yio Chu Kang Stadium and Tampines Stadium. Under Mr Loh’s tutelage. Ms W would train six times a week, generally from Monday to Saturday. She would however occasionally substitute Saturday classes with training sessions on Sunday, as a make-up day[^73].

72     It was Ms W’s evidence that she received both group and individual training sessions from Mr Loh, which was contrary to the accused’s position that he **_never_** scheduled **_individual_** training sessions. Ms W also described the sessions to be rather peripatetic, as Mr Loh would change venues at will. Ms W stated that Mr Loh would “_change quite easily_” between public stadia venues. Ms W described Mr Loh re-scheduling sessions from Bishan Stadium to Yio Chu Kang Stadium when he found the former occupied, or otherwise unsuitable for the track training sessions. Private athletes would generally use public stadia for weekend sessions as the facilities afforded by schools and institutions of higher learning would be closed. On whether Tampines Stadium was used, Ms W evidence was as follows:

>   
| 

(DPP):

 | 

Okay, and earlier you have also mention Tampines Stadium as being one the venues where there may be individual trainings.

 |
| 

Ms W:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

DPP:

 | 

Any particular reason for this location?

 |
| 

Ms W

 | 

**_For Tampines Stadium because Mr. Loh lives at Pasir Ris so, yah._**

 |
| 

\[Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

### Confirmation that individual training sessions were conducted from WhatsApp communication dated 8 March 2013

73     Ms W confirmed that she had individual training sessions with Mr Loh, when the DPP Gail Wong inquired after referencing _WhatsApp_ messages extracted from Ms C’s archives. In a chain of messages on 8 March 2013 at 11:20pm, the duo had begun discussing Ms C’s internship and training. The discussion had shifted to Ms C stating “_Oh Cause I wna double train_ (emoticon)” and “_But I don’t wna do it alone_”. Ms W had clarified that the messages in long-form stated, “_cause I wanna (_i.e.: want to_) double train_” and “_but I don’t wanna do it alone_”. Ms W’s evidence that this was an indication of her preference to train with Ms C. At the same time, she wished to emphasize that she was not keen to train alone with Mr Loh.[^74] When DPP Gail Wong had clarified “_So you haven’t disclosed to her either what happened to you at this stage, correct_?”[^75] Ms W conformed that this exchange had occurred **_before_** the two had completely opened up to each other on their respective accounts of molestation, an event which would only occur some nine days later on 17 March 2013.

74     When probed further, Ms C indicated her preference for double training was predicated in her desire to avoid any situation where she was alone with her trainer. She was unequivocal about her reason[^76]:

> Q    And was this because of what had happened to you?

> A    Yah.

### Significance of the 8 March 2013 messages

75     Ms W’s evidence of these passages was significant in **_two_** separate aspects. The first would be that this exchange, read in the context of what the two had shared with one other on 17 March 2013, could be characterised as a wary **_broaching_** of the topic between the two as to what happened when each of them had trained with Mr Loh. Again, I would think it eminently unlikely for the two to have contrived to plant such subtle yet plaintive set of messages in a mountain of text messages nine days apart to script a narrative just to frame Mr Loh. The other equally significant reason was the fact that the messages were explicit references to **_individual_** training sessions with Ms C and Ms W respectively attended. I would note from the context of the messages that these individual sessions seemed to be an **_occasional_** component of a routine training programme. This was consistent with Ms C’s description of the individual training sessions being introduced within a training programme which primarily involved group training sessions with other athletes.

76     The **_existence_** of such individual training sessions had been strenuously denied by Mr Loh. I would find Mr Loh’s denial that he ever held such classes to be a “_Lucas lie_”, as discerned from principles derived from the case of _Regina v Lucas_ (Ruth) <span class="citation">\[1981\] QB 720</span> at 724. A “_Lucas lie_” of course a deliberate statement which is proven to be untrue from independent evidence, where the motive for the lie is a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth. I will extrapolate in the analysis later in these grounds.

### PW4’s testimony on reporting the acts to the Singapore Athletic Association and police

77     In her testimony, Ms W generally corroborated Ms C’s evidence in relation to the sequence of events leading to the bringing to light of their allegations against Mr Loh. Ms W’s testimony necessarily touched on matters which are the subject matter of pending charges premised on her (Ms W’s) own allegations against Mr Loh. Given that these other charges are stood down and have been scheduled to be the subject of a **_separate_** set of criminal proceedings, I will only reference her testimony in this regard in the most **_general_** terms, and only insofar as the recounted events explain Ms W’s own **_motivation_** for her actions in salient events, or are **_corroborative_** of the complainant’s own account. Both aspects are of course essential for my assessment of her credibility as a witness.

78     In the intervening period between March 2013 and July 2016, Ms W indicated that Ms C had communicated her inclination to “ _report and complain to_ (the Singapore Athletic Association)” but Ms W was “_the one that didn’t want to because_ (Ms W herself) _was really afraid_.”[^77] Ms C had intimated that she “_she wanted to go herself_ …_But in the end she_ (Ms C_) didn’t_”.[^78] Ms W described her experiences to have affected her and she had while, enrolled in a polytechnic and competing overseas in 2016[^79], shared with a “_what happened to me and Mr. Loh_”.[^80] She had broken down and cried, and her friend had sensed that she still affected by her recounted events and “_felt that_ (Ms W) _should do something about it and not let it go_.” He had encouraged Ms W to take a number of measures to be proactive and “_stand up_” for herself. These suggestions included the making of a police report. That conversation with her friend had continued after had returned from the overseas competition. The momentum for acting had gathered pace in mid-2016.

79     The triggering event which prompted Ms W’s course of action was Ms C sharing the article with Ms W on 24 June 2016 via _WhatsApp_.[^81] Ms W had continued to speak to her friend, which has stiffened her resolve to make a police report. Ms W recalled a conversation with Ms C where she had told her either that “_I’m going to make a police report or we should make a police report_”[^82]. She reported that the complainant had delighted about Ms W’s overcoming her previous inhibition to reporting the acts of molestation that Ms W herself had allegedly faced from Mr Loh, as Ms C “_had been already always wanted to do that_. _Just that_ (Ms W) _didn’t want to go with her_.”[^83] Ms W testified that Ms C was “_very happy_… _and_ (s)tr_aightaway_ (said) _yes, I’ll go with you_” [^84]Ms W’s impression was that Ms C was pleased to have “_somebody to go with and, yah, she’s finally doing what she always like wanted to do_.”[^85]

80     In respect of her own motivation for proceeding, besides standing up for herself, Ms W claimed to have been driven by a desire to prevent future trainees from falling prey. She alluded to experiencing a measure of guilt that she had failed to speak up about her own sexual assaults before Ms C joined the training group and had in-turn become a victim herself. In her own verbatim and unedited words:[^86]

> …I knew like I was still very affected by whatever happened. So I felt that now as like I’m older and more matured, hmm, that I should finally stand up for myself and more like I’d like---**_I just didn’t want to regret that I didn’t do anything about it as I grow older and also definitely to prevent anyone from happening to them because that’s what I regretted ‘cause---because I didn’t do anything when it happen to me. Then_** (Ms C) **_joined Mr. Loh then so it kinda switched over to her._** So kind of thing of it like if I actually stood up for myself and if I made---I---like if I did something about it, it definitely won’t happened to her.

> \[Emphasis added\]

### Filing the police reports

81     Ms W stated that there had been no special significance on the date the report had been made, which was 30 July 2016, and it had merely been the date that and Ms C had been free to undertake the process of filing the report. Ms W indicated that the “_Police Post_” at Bishan (actually Bishan Neighbour Police Station or NPC) had been selected as the location was “_very central_” to both[^87]. Ms W indicated that the two complainants did not discuss any details about what had happened as both “_already know what happened to us_”. Ms W also thought it best not to engage in any prior discussion as she did not understand criminal processes and procedures and sought to simply follow the specific instructions given by the police officers, It was also the case that each had to give their own separate account for their respective reports to be filed, and neither was a direct witness of the other’s alleged sexual assault. After filing the report, Ms W stated that she had felt “_relief”_ as she had “_finally stood up_” for herself and also for Ms C. According to her, the two were “_just really very happy for each other_” but both were “_also definitely like really very scared as well_” as they did not know what would happen next.

### Concerns after filing police report.

82     Ms W surmised that her previous hesitancy to report had been her anxiety from “_outside people_”[^88] knowing what had happened to them, and she had much preferred that people not know of what had allegedly transpired. Ms W added “(s)_o now that we finally reported we just really very scared of our reputation, uh, what others would think about us…”[^89]_ Unfortunately for Ms W, these fears of revelation and disclosure of their alleged sexual assaults to “_outside people_” would be realised in a matter of hours, as she was subject to harassment from persons close to the accused. How these individuals, and indeed Mr Loh came to know the **_identity_** of his accusers, and the precise **_time_** he and his supporters knew, is a matter of considerable relevance in this case. Mr Loh’s reaction after the reports were filed are cogent in assessing any circumstantial consciousness of guilt. Also, germane would be Ms W’s reaction to this harassment, and her messages to Ms C. This aspect thus justifies a more thorough setting out of what Ms W says she faced.

### Harassment in the aftermath of the reports

83     Ms W had lodged the report on 30 July 2013 at 2.03 pm. This is established by an exhibit[^90] tendered by the prosecution, which was a redacted version of Ms W’s report. Notably the report shows the complaint to have pertained to an act, or acts, between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2012, which, as Ms W has testified, preceded the timespan of the offences alleged in the present case. Ms W had received her first call the very next morning when a trainee who was one of a set of twins training under Mr Loh (“Ms T”), had called just after she had awakened. The moment Ms W had picked up the phone, Ms T had demanded “(M’s W’s nickname), _did you make a report on Mr. Loh_?” Ms W had been shocked by the call. In her own words (verbatim and unedited)[^91]:

> Then I was shocked ‘cause like everything happened so quickly like I **_was thinking how did she even know about it._** … So I just said, “Huh”? Then she asked again 2nd time, “(Ms W’s nickname), _did you make a report on Mr. Loh_”? Then I say, “_Why_”? **_Because I remembered when I reported like the IO told me not to share with anyone at all about the report._** So I’m not---gonna not to tell anybody that I made a report. …**_Then she straightaway like accused me and she said “(_**Ms W’s nickname}**_, are you sure you want do this, you know, if you are lying you can be in serious like trouble”_**. Then I say---then obviously I felt really, really very angry also because she was like my training mate and she immediately kinda like question my---like question whatever I did so obviously I didn’t want to entertain her at all. So I just straightaway say, “Yah, mmm, okay then bye”, yah. It’s because I knew what I did was like the truth so like, “Yah, okay, I won’t---I know I won’t get into trouble. So whatever she say, like I just really---really didn’t bother at all.

> \[Emphasis added\]

84     What is notable in this case is Ms W’s indication that she was specifically cautioned by the investigation officer not to tell anyone else about her having made the report. Another striking aspect of her testimony is the rather menacing tone of Ms T’s questions, which vehemently seeks to dissuade her of her course of action in “_are you sure you want to do this_” with an implicit **_presupposition_** that Ms W is untruthful by mounting accusations of this nature, in her dire warning of the consequences of “_lying_”. Of course, the most curious aspect is how Ms T came to be informed of the reports made and the premises upon which she had made a call which bordered on an interference with the very nascent criminal investigation. On this aspect, Ms W responded to DPPs queries as follows:

>   
| 

DPP

 | 

And do you know how ‘_Ms T_’ knew?

 |
| 

Ms W

 | 

Definitely from Mr. Loh.

 |
| 

DPP

 | 

And why do you say this?

 |
| 

Ms W

 | 

Hmm, if I’m not wrong I think Mr. Loh contacted her and told her about like---told her about it that I reported about him.

 |
| 

DPP

 | 

But (_Ms T_) actually didn’t tell you that how she knew about it as well.

 |
| 

Ms W

 | 

No, I don’t think so. I just assumed.

 |

  
  

85     Ms W continued to receive queries about the police report she had filed. One instance which she could recount was when one “_Ignatius_”, who had been Mr Loh’s trainee from Catholic Junior College had “suddenly” contacted her to ask asked if she had in her possession an image where Ms C and Ms W had been present. Ms W was perplexed that he would “_suddenly randomly_” ask for the image and thus asked for the purpose behind the request. Ignatius revealed that Mr. Loh had asked him to find that particular picture. Ms W had sensed that this requisition for a particular image had been related to the case against Mr Loh. She was naturally disinclined to assist Ignatius and simply told him that she did not have the image sought.

### Significance of the image of accused with PW3 and PW4

86     Ms W indicated that the image Mr Loh sought[^92] (and which he eventually produced to the investigation officer on 2 August 2016 from another source) had been one of Ms C’s birthday celebrations in **_April 2013_**. This image depicted Ms C, Ms W and other athletes with Mr Loh in a convivial setting. Ms C was holding a set of cup-cakes. The significance of the image arose from Mr Loh’s bid to show the image to the investigation officer as proof of sorts that he was on good terms with Ms C. Given that the prosecution’s stance was that the investigation officers had **_not_** told Mr Loh **_who_** his accusers were prior to the meeting on 2 August 2016, the accused’s production of the image would have been problematic for his case, since this would have shown not just his knowledge of who at least one his accusers (i.e., Ms C ) were, but that he necessarily also knew that the allegations would be in relation to acts committed **_before_** April 2013. Mr Loh had run his defence case on the premise that he had **_never_** conducted individual training sessions for Ms C, and hence there would have been no reference period for him to refute allegations by such means.

### Ms W’s evidence on individual training sessions

87     At cross-examination, Ms W indicated that Mr Loh had arranged for individual training sessions for her. She did not agree with counsel’s suggestion that because of group trainings, individual sessions could be conducted on Sundays. While Sunday was the day with a clear slot allowing individual training sessions, Ms W indicated that Mr Loh controlled the schedule and could change the time for training sessions at will. Ms W stated that “_it’s not really always Sunday. As in sometimes, it could be weekday, it could be Saturday as well_.” And that it all “_really depends_”[^93] on the times assigned by Mr Loh. Ms W claimed that Mr Loh could be mercurial and “_he could call you …like randomly to go down for training_.” Ms W stated that she had on occasion trained twice in a single day under his tutelage.

### Individual training sessions

88     Ms W who indicated that she did not recall Mr Loh asking her to attend individual training sessions in 2013, did not know much about Ms C’s individual training sessions until Ms C opened up to her and beseeched Ms W not to leave her alone for individual trainings. It was then that she realised that Ms C had attended individual trainings with Mr. Loh[^94]. Ms W had attended individual training sessions with Mr Loh and described his _modus operandi_ in scheduling such sessions[^95].

>   
| 

DPP:

 | 

…(W)ho was the one who initiated those sessions?

 |
| 

Ms W

 | 

Initiate---initiated to like have individual, is it?

 |
| 

DPP:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Ms W:

 | 

Um, not really initiate but **_Mr. Loh will just tell me to like come… for this training, where is the venue at, which what timing so I’ll just be there_**.

 |
| 

DPP:

 | 

That---**_would he actually tell you that is individual, or he will just tell you the training and the venue_**?

 |
| 

Ms W:

 | 

Um, like---more or less like he won’t really say that “Oh, it will be individual training.” But ‘cause usually it’s sun---if it’s Sunday then it’s individual, hmm, yah. **_But sometimes like I will ask around my training mates like_** “_Are you training_?” **_that kind so if they say no then like I will kind of figure out that I’ll be alone._**

 |

  
  

89     Ms W’s evidence was that Mr Loh was such a dominant figure in the coach-trainee relationship that he would just state the venue and time of the session. Ms W never asked whether the training would be an individual or group session, although she might infer that a Sunday session would be an individual one. If she wished to know if a weekday or Saturday session was an individual session, she would be constrained to message her fellow trainees and poll them as to whether they had been asked to join in the training. She would then extrapolate by elimination that she was the **_sole_** trainee on the days Mr Loh had scheduled a session for her. Essentially, this reticence to simply ask the accused directly showed trainees such as Ms C and Ms W to have felt enormously **_beholden_** to Mr Loh, who did not collect any payments from his private students, just taking emoluments from his formal coaching session in schools.

### Observations of the coach-trainee dynamics leading to unquestioning trust in accused by PW3 and PW4

90     Other aspects of Mr Loh which were relevant to the case would be the complainants’ contention that Mr Loh could drive, with both Ms C[^96] and Ms W[^97] citing separate instances where he had driven or offered to drive them to a destination. This, along with the fact that Mr Loh lived in Pasir Ris, which was fairly short distance from Tampines Stadium, either by MRT or car, would be an aspect to bear in mind in assessing Mr Loh’s alibi defence. There were several aspects of the dynamics of the coach-trainee relationship which I regarded to be relevant in understanding the attitudes and behaviour of the complainants and other trainees in this case, in particular, in the extent of their trust and constraint to follow Mr Loh in an unquestioning manner.

91     From the evidence, both Ms C and Ms W had felt deeply obliged to Mr Loh for taking them under his wing, as he was a highly regarded coach. Both also regarded Mr Loh to be a strict disciplinarian on the track, and his instructions were followed without question, including his scheduling of training sessions with little notice in the manner attested to by Ms W above. While the foregoing and the following which arose from the testimony of Ms W may appear digressive, they do, in my mind, explain the seeming pliancy and trust of Ms C in attending her own individual sessions, as well as her disorientation and fragmented recall of surrounding circumstances of the episodes of alleged molestation, particularly in the layout and peripheral aspects of Tampines Stadium, a venue she barely knew until she was told to attend at the premises.

### Involvement in personal lives and education choices of trainees

92     At the same time Mr Loh maintained close ties and excellent rapport with the athletes of his training group at a **_personal_** level and would organise communal meals such as steamboat dinners at his favourite restaurant; _Thien Kee Steamboat_ at Golden Mile Tower[^98] At cross examination, Ms W had confirmed that Mr Loh had organised her birthday there in late 2012, where the commemorations had included the taking of a group photograph of Ms C and Mr Loh[^99]. Mr Loh was even able to inveigle himself into the personal lives of his athletes. Mr Loh had reached a level of familiarity with his trainees where he would even take liberties in critiquing their choice of a boyfriend. He had, by his own admission, asked Ms W “_Why you choose Indian boyfriend_.”[^100], when he had met her (and the boyfriend) in a sporting event after she had commenced her polytechnic education. While Mr Loh had characterised this episode to involve light-hearted banter (and made the dubious claim that Ms W took no offence), the episode does show the accused to not be averse to extending the training relationship to a licence for intrusion into the trainee’s personal life, including a **_disparagement_** of her personal choice of a boyfriend, seemingly on account of his race. While this event had occurred after Ms W had commenced her polytechnic education in April 2013 (and hence post-dated the alleged assaults), the incident was an exemplar of Mr Loh’s persistent pattern of crossing boundaries between the professional trainer-trainee relationship, and areas which ought be well within the parameters of their personal life and private choices.

93     For Ms W, Mr Loh's intrusion into her educational choices had been most evident in the controversy over her choice of a polytechnic and the course she had preferred. Mr Loh had managed to secure Ms W a place in Singapore Polytechnic, after she was unsuccessful in her bid for a place there. The _caveat_ was that the course that Mr Loh secured a place for Ms M had been for a course of study in “Maritime Business”[^101]. Ms W had preferred to undertake a different course with her early choices being related to tourism or accountancy, and eventually secured a place in another polytechnic. She had proceeded to enrol in that local polytechnic for a discipline related to sports and wellness, which drew Mr Loh’s ire.

94     Ms W’s circumvention of a choice of study that Mr Loh had apparently “**_decided_**” for her, led to a tense situation, as evidenced by messages from Ms W and DW 6 Mr Oon Kwan Yong, where Ms W had asked[^102] “_He’s angry w me right?_” Ms W had also stated in a subsequent message that she had apologised and “_texted him a long text explaining myself…He didn’t reply_”. The remainder of the text was long disquisition which was revealing in both Ms W’s discomfiture in the manner that Mr Loh sought to “call the shots” in her education and future career choices (“_It’s wrong for me to think of my future_”[^103] and “_I explained all I could already, I rly dk what else I can do_”[^104]) and DW 6, Mr Oon’s devotion to Mr Loh in upbraiding Ms W (“_Anyhow, you really owe mr loh a lot. He did a lot for you, be it this thing or other stuff. He is just very upset and disappointed. Just decide for yourself what you should do”[^105]_). Mr Oon betrays his **_own_** fear of incurring Mr Loh’s wrath by telling Ms W of the training venue and time, which Mr Loh had communicated to him (but not her), and then cautioning “_Don’t tell him I say one_, _later I die_”[^106]

### Blurring of professional-private boundary had an emboldening effect.

95     Analysing the accounts of both prosecution and defence witnesses, my view is that the boundary was likely further **_“fudged”_** by the regular and convivial association of the training group after training sessions, and the fact that Mr Loh did not charge a fee for his tutelage of his private trainees, lending to an implicit sense, by at least some in Mr Loh’s group, that his commitment ought be reciprocated by tolerating his rough edges or explaining away even more egregious conduct.

96     The latter situation was quite evident by Ms C’s own teacher’s; Ms Michelle Eng’s bizarre _apologia_ to Ms C that the touch may have been accidental, or otherwise without intent to cause offence, as Mr Loh “_really has that bond with you and maybe he just overstepped his position_”, and her musing that “_maybe he’s so old that he doesn’t understand what the comfort level of a massage should be_. This permissive setting, allowing regular incursions into the realm of his trainee’s private lives had, in my view, an ever-emboldening effect on Mr Loh, and a concomitant **_inhibition_** by his accusers, by peer pressure or confusion, to immediately react and call him to account when Mr Loh’s committed the asserted acts during the private training sessions. While I did not see any organised attempt at _“gaslighting”_ (or deliberate psychological manipulation to make a person doubt him or herself, by Mr Loh), the **_effect_** was still the same. Ms C stated that she was perplexed by the dichotomy of the alleged sexual offences committed against her, and her lingering wish to “_keep not wanting to think he’s bad”_[^107] given their shared experiences and Mr Loh being a coach that she looked up to, respected and trusted.

### Accused’s all-encompassing influence and control over his trainees’ lives

97     While learned defence counsel was evidently trying to frame her case that Ms W had turned against Mr Loh as a result of resentment, her cross-examination inevitably (and likely inadvertently) revealed the scope of Mr Loh’s **_control_** extended to multiple aspects of her life[^108]:

DC:

 | 

Did you feel that at that point in time, Mr. Loh did not give you a freedom to choose the course that you like?

 |
| 

Ms W:

 | 

Hmm, I suppose so…

As in---not like he didn’t give me a freedom, just that like he won’t understand.

 |
| 

DC:

 | 

He won’t understand?

 |
| 

Ms W

 | 

Yah.

 |
| 

DC:

 | 

Would it be correct if I say that he’s imposing on you? That means make you feel pressurised to follow the direction that he wants you to go?

 |
| 

Ms W

 | 

Hmm, yah.

 |
| 

DC

 | 

**_That includes also for the training_**.

 |
| 

Ms W

 | 

**_Yah._**

 |
| 

DC:

 | 

**_So he will not let you decide when you train because he dictated it. He decide when you train_**.

 |
| 

Ms W

 | 

**_Yah._**

 |
| 

DC:

 | 

**_And you don’t even have the freedom to not turn up because he will scold you_**.

 |
| 

Ms W

 | 

**_Yah._**

 |
| 

\[Emphasis added\]

98     Ms W had joined the aforementioned local polytechnic in April 2013 and stopped training under Mr Loh in early to mid-2013. She confirmed that her decision had arisen from circumstances related to her complaint[^109]. Ms W nevertheless continued to attend group social gatherings including the birthday celebration mentioned above.

### PW3 and PW 4 had a relationship that was primarily limited to training and associated activities and did not know each other very well

99     Before leaving this section setting out PW4’s testimony, I would observe that Ms C and Ms W, despite obviously bonding as co-trainees under Mr Loh’s tutelage, **_did not know each other very well_** in personal aspects unrelated to training, and lived their lives quite separately from each other. Their backgrounds differed considerably. Ms C lived in an intact household with PW1 and PW2 and several siblings, the majority of whom were almost as academically accomplished as Ms C, who herself had been offered a place in the medical faculty of a local university but had chosen a course of study in another university to benefit from a scholarship offered for her chosen course. Ms W lived in a single parent household and struggled academically (which had prompted Mr Loh to assist her in securing a place in Singapore Polytechnic) even as she excelled to the national level in her chosen track events. Their attitudes differed too, with Ms C far more determined to bring Mr Loh to account, and taking issue with Ms W’s lassitude in reporting her own alleged sexual abuse and suffering in silence in the period before she (Ms C) had joined the group, whereupon Mr Loh turned his attention to her.

100    While Ms W had described herself as being “_close_” to Ms C and that they did “_talk about stuff outside our training_,”[^110] my sense is that their bond was rather superficial, and their frequency of contact appeared to have tapered off until the two again found a common cause to report following the sequence of events emanating from the _Today_ newspaper article in July 2016. It was significant that **_Ms W also barely knew Mr A_**. I accept that she would **_know of_** him but did not really **_know_** him in any depth of familiarity. There was considerable confusion caused during both the examination-in-chief and cross-examination when Ms W erroneously described Mr A as Ms C’s “_boyfriend_” and as the one who had told her that the series of sensations that she experienced at the final session had been an orgasm. In Ms W’s own words, describing the events at her face-to-face meeting with Ms C at Bishan Stadium on 18 March 2013 (which was the day after their mutual revelations by WhatsApp messages):[^111]

>   
| 

DPP:

 | 

And in this session when you had a face to face talk with her…Can you tell us what details she shared with you about what was done to her?

 |
| 

Ms W

 | 

Hmm, basically I think she just shared like same thing of like what she mentioned like in the text like she say she massage and then like she felt weird like the groin and also this she explained to me like he---Mr. Loh massage (Ms C) and (Ms C) just told me that she felt weird like it’s kind of funny and I told her that I felt the same then like, um, I think she shared with me like she told **_her boyfriend_** about it. And **_her boyfriend_** told her that it’s not something that she should feeling ‘cause she’s had a **_boyfriend_**\---she explained to her **_boyfriend_** what she felt when Mr. Loh massage her groin. So **_boyfriend told her that she felt like an orgasm_**.

 |
| 

 | 

\[Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

101    Ms W had at cross examination maintained that Ms C had told her that that she had made the revelation to her **_boyfriend_** on the day that they had met[^112]:

>   
| 

DC:

 | 

So, just to make sure I understand you correctly---alright? So, you said, when she mentioned the details of what happened to her **_she said her boyfriend_**.

 |
| 

Ms W:

 | 

Mmm hmm.

 |
| 

DC:

 | 

As plain---

 |
| 

Ms W

 | 

**_Boyfriend._**

 |
| 

DC:

 | 

**_the word. Her boyfriend_**.

 |
| 

Ms W:

 | 

**_Yah._**

 |
| 

DC:

 | 

But not the name.

 |
| 

Ms W:

 | 

No.

 |
| 

DC:

 | 

And you didn’t ask for the name?

 |
| 

Ms W:

 | 

No.

 |
| 

DC:

 | 

So subsequently, then she mentioned the---her boyfriend’s name is ‘Mr B’?

 |
| 

Ms W:

 | 

…**_I think she randomly said ‘Mr B’. Then, I just figured out that’s her boyfriend’s name._**

### Conflation of events by PW4 in respect of purported conversation on 18 March 2013

102    There are several **_issues_** with Ms W’s recall of events. In relation to her testimony on a purported conversation 18 March 2013, where she recalled a face-to-face discussion with Ms C, there seems to be a conflation with her reference to Ms C’s “_boyfriend_” describing the sensations felt by the complainant to be an orgasm in that exchange, as Ms C would **_not_** have communicated with Mr A for **_another 12 days_** before the mutual exchange of their individual sources of angst on 30 March 2013. Ms C also did **_not_** have a boyfriend on 18 March 2013, and would only meet “Mr B”, the person Ms W had named in her testimony, in **_May_** 2013, after Ms C had enrolled in her university, with the relationship only becoming serious in late 2013[^113]. Of course, the most glaring discrepancy in Ms W’s account would be the fact that Mr A had announced his plan to “_come out_” to be known as a gay person in their _WhatsApp_ messages on 30 March 2013. Ms C would not have had any illusions about Mr A being a potential boyfriend given his declared homosexual orientation, and thus would not have identified Mr A as her boyfriend to Ms W.

103    Incidentally, Mr A was actually **_named_** in Ms C’s message to Ms W on 24 June 2016,[^114] it was therefore surprising that Ms W conflated Mr **B**; Ms C’s latter-day boyfriend, with Mr **A**, her confidant who happened to be gay. This, in my view, demonstrated that Ms C and Ms W were not especially close, and appeared to have gone on with their own lives and separate circles of friends from mid-2013, until the two resolved in June 2016 to make the report to the police, in the circumstances mentioned in the foregoing. All in all, I found Ms W to have a considerably poorer recall of events than Ms C, and also prone to conflate events as a result of this tendency. While I would question the **_reliability_** of her testimony (at least for the trial before me) due to the stated bases, I would see no reason to doubt that Ms W was a **_truthful_** and forthright witness, notwithstanding the _caveat_ mentioned.

### Another instance of possible conflation by PW4

104    I should also add that it was for the reasons stated above that, I was left to wonder if Ms C’s message to Ms Eng at 31 July 2016[^115] that Ms W had **_told her_** that the police had **_revealed_** the names of Ms C and Ms W to the accused **_before_** a statement was recorded from Mr Loh might have been yet another mischaracterisation by Ms W, given her unfortunate propensity to conflate facts and unintentionally misrepresent the actual state of affairs. This was within a situation where she had been placed in a state of distress by the unexpected call from irate Ms T earlier that morning. This is particularly where the circumstantial evidence pointed starkly otherwise; that is, that it was highly unlikely for an experienced police investigation officer to have committed such an egregiously unprofessional act. It was, after all, Ms W’s own evidence that the police officer she spoke to had cautioned her not reveal her making the report (“_Because I remembered when I reported like the IO told me not to share with anyone at all about the report_”)[^116]. I would very much prefer not to embark in any form of speculation. Nevertheless, noting Ms W’s rather loose way of connecting facts and events, and also in a situation where Ms T might likely feel constrained to explain how she **_knew_** of the police reports being filed, I would not be able to exclude the possibility that Ms W had again conflated something that Ms T might have **_told_** her over the phone, to be an **_actual_** occurrence, and framed this to be such in her _WhatsApp_ message to Ms C. I will elaborate further on this aspect of the case later in these grounds.

### Limited association between PW3, PW4 and PW 5 make collusion to frame accused less likely.

105    Returning to the limited extent of association between Ms C and Ms W. I would note that outside of their training together from late 2012 to early 2013, and occasional get-togethers with fellow athletes training under Mr Loh’s wing, the two did not maintain an especially intense relationship. This view was reinforced by Ms W’s utter lack of familiarity with Mr A, who was Ms C’s gay platonic friend, to the extent of mistaking him for Mr B; her boyfriend in a relationship which post-dated the material time by months. Given Ms W’s confusion of quite basic aspects of Ms C’s friend’s personal life, it seemed that the connection between the two had been rather sporadic and peripheral in the intervening period. Given that a close collusion needed for such an enterprise, it seemed all the more **_improbable_** that the _WhatsApp_ messages between Ms C and Ms W could have been artfully fabricated messages crafted three years apart; from March 2013 to August 2016, which were created for the express purpose of framing Mr Loh with crimes of sexual assault. I was therefore convinced that the content in these _WhatsApp_ messages had been spontaneously created and done without any premeditated ulterior motive on the part of the respective authors of these text messages.

### Evidence of PW5: Mr A

106    Mr A had, at the time of his testimony, just graduated from a local university and was currently seeking employment in an engineering field. Mr A and Ms C attended the same junior college, and both had the same co-curricular activity which was track and field. They had known each other since 2009, when Ms C was the equivalent of secondary three. Mr A and Ms C had both started out in jump events before Ms C graduated to sprints because of a paucity of sprinters at their junior college, and Ms C had shown potential in events of that nature. Despite that move Ms C and Mr A would still train together as that were collectively still part of the same track and field group, uh, track and field team. Mr A declared that the two “_were very good friends and_ …_we are still very good friends_”[^117] who would still meet up at least once a year. Mr A confirmed that Ms Michelle Eng had been one of the coaches at their junior college. Mr A had never been directly coached by Mr Loh but had encountered the accused when he (Mr A) had participated to an event in Australia when he was Primary four. Mr Loh had accompanied the school group to Australia, but the two had never interacted directly.

107    Mr A confirmed that he had written the posts attributed to his device in P3, and that he had received the messages attributed to Ms C. At the time of the messages on 30 March 2013, he had been aware that Ms C had completed Junior College and was undergoing “external” training with Mr. Loh. Ms. C had been disheartened about her lack of progress, confessing that she was “_quite sick of still being so slow_”. Mr A had countered “_You’re gonna be a national athlete soon_”, not because she had evinced any such aspiration, but merely to encourage her. When Mr A had confessed his desire to come out as a homosexual, Ms C had surprised him with her confession that “_I have something I’ve been keeping too_”.[^118] This had occurred in the context of his “_confiding in her in some personal issues”_, which of course related to Mr A’s desire to reveal his orientation. Ms C had then continued with text which Mr A took to understand in its unabbreviated form as “_But I don’t think you can help anyway_.” and “_I think Mr. Loh molested me, I don’t know_.”

108    Mr A had expressed his reaction to be one of “_definitely shock_”, as this was Ms C’s first intimation that she had been molested by Mr Loh, and he sensed that this was “_an issue that was close to her heart_” and in his words “_it took quite a lot for her to tell me_ …_after I confided in her_.”[^119]

109    While Mr A had an intimately close relationship with Ms C to the point of their confessing their innermost secrets, Mr A was clear that he had no such familiarity with Ms W. By a plain contrast, he only **_knew of_** her, and did not know her “personally”. This is congruent with Ms W herself having such a dim recollection of Mr A, that she had confused him with Mr B; Ms C’s boyfriend.

### Mr A’s responses and his exhortations to act

110    It was quite evident that Mr A made repeated exhortations for Ms C to report the apparent sexual assaults or to seek help, once he understood that the Ms C’s account included intrusions to her pelvic and genital area. Upon Mr A’s quizzical “_Huh, what did he do_?”, Ms C had responded “_Kept rubbing my groin until I got that weird feeling_.”. By “groin”, Mr A understood Ms C to be referencing her “_pelvic or private area_”. Mr A had also understood the “_weird feeling_” to have been an orgasm[^120]. Mr A had asked “_Why did he even rub your groin_?” and had been in a what he described as a state of shock and disgust when he exclaimed in a text “_Dude that’s not cool at all, how can you just ignore it?”_ Mr A had then learnt that Ms W had been subject to similar acts. He had confirmed that he had admonished “_If you don’t do anything about it nothing is gonna change and it might get worse_.”[^121] Mr A was explicit that he had expected Ms C to “_take some action_”.[^122]

111    When Ms C had displayed some reticence by suggesting that “_I was thinking like next time just say, I don’t want. Yeah, it kind of got worse like first few times he just touch.”[^123]_, Mr A had confirmed his strident response “_and you all can still behave normal like nothing happened_ “and explained that he was discomfited with the notion that she “_was considering not taking any action_”. Ms A had thought it important that “_she should actually change the way that things were happening_”, at that point in time.

112    Mr A had continued to be emphatic in challenging Ms C “_Don’t you plan to stop it, I mean just tell him, you don’t want, yah, you definitely should if he doesn’t listen then it’s time to seek help seriously_.” Mr A indicated that his reference was for Ms C to consider some form of professional help but had nothing specific in mind. When Ms C had continued “_That’s why I keep not wanting to think he is bad”_, Mr A’s indignation had been palpable “I_t it’s intentional then yes, he’s bad, it’s not right_.”

113    While externalising his sense of outrage, Mr A was still circumspect in ‘_caveating_’ his response with a qualification “_if it’s intentional_”, explaining that he was inclined to give coaches the benefit of a doubt, and that it would be a “_really a wrong thing to do”_[^124] only if there had been a demonstrably guilty intent. Mr A, however, registered his doubt that any massage which intruded to the trainee’s genitals could be legitimate. The point that needs to be made is that Mr A had appeared in court to essentially confirm that the _WhatsApp_ messages had been **_contemporaneously_** created and he had responded in a spontaneous run of text messages.

### PW5 had advocated proceeding by confronting Mr Loh and making discreet inquiries with Ms Eng

114    It is also significant that Mr A’s initial reaction had been balanced and objective rather than bellicose or impulsive. He had not, at first instance, suggested that Ms C file a police report for the purpose of initiating an investigation, despite his being made aware that the massage had involved such a prolonged intrusion that Ms C had reported sensations associated with an orgasm. Mr A had instead asked Ms C to “_confront the matter_” and not to ignore it. He had suggested that that Ms C ask Mr Loh himself _“discreetly_” about the purpose of the massage. Ms C had baulked at the notion[^125] and intimated that she had intended to approach Ms Eng but had not had the opportunity as she had not seen her again. Mr A had again seen Ms C begun to vacillate on the fear that it was “_quite weird to tell her_ (Ms Eng) _that her coach is like sick I won’t dare_”. When Ms C bemoaned to him that she had herself become like Ms W in her reticence to act on Mr Loh’s alleged acts, Mr A had adroitly steeled her resolve by telling her “_Then ask Ms. Eng_”.

115    In his court testimony, Mr A had explained that he had so advised as Ms Eng used to train under Mr. Loh. Knowing his idiosyncrasies from experience, he expected that Ms Eng would have been in a position to relate with Ms C and advise her what to do[^126]. When Ms C had yet again vacillated that she would “_probably_” ask Ms Eng, Mr A’s nimble riposte was “_Don’t probably me, do it or I’ll ask for you_”.[^127]

116    At this point Ms C had told Mr A “_Wait I’ll do it when I see her_”, and he had then pressed her for an answer “_When_”. Ms C had again demurred “_I don’t know, soon_”. This response had piqued Mr A as he was perturbed that she seemed “_still undecisive_” on whether to heed his advice and tell Ms. Eng about what had allegedly happened. Mr A regarded his objective to be to persuade Ms C to “_take some action before things got worse_.” and became concerned when Ms C yet again sought to rationalise that it was safe to attend group training sessions an Mr Loh would only commit the acts if when she trained alone with him at Tampines[^128].

### PW5’s reminder to “tell Ms Eng” 13 hours later

117    After the message at 10.39 am on 30 March 2013, the chat then drifted to Ms C’s church activities. Some 13 hours later, at 11.38 pm, Mr A sent her another message, this time an **_emphatic_** reminder “_And rmb to tell ms eng!!!!!_” [^129] Mr A’s testimony was that he had sent the reminder “_Because it was something that I felt strongly that she should do_”.[^130] Mr A also confirmed Ms C’s account of his revelation that the “weird feeling” she described was an orgasm, He described meeting her in person in 2013, and “_explaining to her what an orgasm was and relating her weird feeling to an orgasm_.”[^131]. As to who had used the word “orgasm”, Mr A, confirming Ms C naivety on matters carnal, stated “_It was probably me because she didn’t know about it back then._” [^132]

118    An important detail in Ms A’s testimony would be that he corroborated Ms C’s account in confirming that he had followed through and spoken to Ms Eng, He had not divulged any details of the complainant’s revelation, and merely stated that Ms C had “_something important that she wanted to tell_”[^133] Ms Michelle Eng. Mr A recalled in court that he had sent a text message and remembered that the message had been sent in 2013.

### The evolution of discussion in WhatsApp text shows a progressive unravelling of emotional states and attitudes that militates against likelihood of fabrication.

119    The evolution of the _WhatsApp_ chat was notable in the sense of its genesis and progression. In relation to the **_origin_** of the discussion, it was Mr A who had **_initiated_** the sharing of secrets in confiding his angst in concealing his sexual identity and anticipation of relief in ‘coming out’ as gay. There had been an initial reaction of shock when Ms C had reciprocated in her own revelation. This was followed by Mr A’s exhortation to act, and he had then barely masked his exasperation over Ms C’s rather feeble or non-committal responses to simply not “_thinking about it_” (i.e.: incidents of molest) to help her forget, or in avoiding situations where she would train singly with Mr Loh, to gradually reach a point where he had proposed his courses of action.

120    There was no basis to suggest any prior enmity between Mr A and Mr Loh given their only association was a fleeting acquaintance when he was primary four. This is, of course, aside from his reacting to Ms C’s account of sexual assault in the hands of Mr Loh which he unstintingly accepted as true. Even so, he was cautious not to rush to judgment, and approached the issue from a **_principled_** standpoint, suggesting that she first confront Mr Loh, and then speak to Ms Eng, when she baulked and prevaricated at the former notion. I accepted that this progression of the _WhatsApp_ communication disclosed a **_genuine_** conversation, which entirely cohered with the content of Ms C’s earlier exchanges with Ms W. Mr A’s reactions to what he was told and his own proposals to act had, in my view, an authentic physiological nuance which would be difficult to mimic or fabricate in a premeditated ‘scripted’ dialogue.

121    By the same token, I would have found it difficult to conceive any possibility for Ms C to fabricate an account and weave an elaborately manufactured tapestry with the presented factual matrix to deceive Mr A into following her on a false narrative. To do so, she would have had to necessarily possess the preternatural ability to **_anticipate_** how Mr A would respond in successive exchanges in their prolonged _WhatsApp_ chat, and lead Mr A on step-by-step, down to the point where he was practically goading her to escalate the alleged offences.

### Continuity and follow through by revealing to a third party; DW5, Ms Eng.

122    What makes the exchange between Mr A and Ms C especially convincing is that Mr A had advocated actual correspondence with a third party, Ms Michelle Eng, who had a long-shared history with Mr Loh. He had followed through by telling Ms Eng, and there is **_continuity_** in event sequence as Ms C’s long message to Ms Eng on 2 June 2016 references her initial conversation with Ms Eng at a National School Championship (which she recalled to have been held in 2013) and which had, in turn, been precipitated by Mr A having the gumption to directly approach Ms Eng that Ms C had something to say to her. Mr A also recounted Ms C sending him a draft version of the _WhatsApp_ note that she had intended to send to Ms Eng[^134], and which she did on 2 June 2016[^135].My sense is that Mr A would have been unlikely to **_volunteer_** information of such co-operation if there had been any actual **_collusion_** between the two to frame Mr Loh. All in all, I found Mr A to be forthright witness who had come forward to give evidence from a principled basis, even as this came with a personal cost of having to lay bare certain intimate details of his own life.

### Evidence of PW 6; Principal Meteorologist Ang Chieng Hai

123    Mr Ang Chieng Hai was the sixth witness called. As a Principal Meteorologist, Mr Ang had worked with the National Environment Agency’s Meteorological service since 1999. His current role in the Climatology and Climate Studies section included the maintenance of climate and weather records. Mr Ang had exhibited an hourly rainfall tabulation report[^136] for a rain gauge emplaced at Tampines Pond in Simei Avenue, which was the vicinity closest to Tampines Stadium. His evidence was that there had been an episode of rain in the late afternoon to early evening of 10 March 2013 with moderate rain for some 35 minutes from 5.00 p.m. and light rain for another ten minutes from 6.00 p.m. on 10 March 2013, which was a Sunday, and the day the prosecution believed the third training session to have occurred. I noted that the 45 minutes of rain had been the longest spell of rain for the fortnight, with the second heaviest for that fortnight, which would validate the accounts of Ms C and her father’s accounts of the precipitation they had experienced, which had hampered the training session.

## A CHRONOLOGICAL TIMELINE OF EVENTS

### Projected dates of the private training sessions for the prosecution’s case

124    In setting out the prosecution’s case, it would be apposite to state the three relevant dates advanced by the prosecution in relation to the private training sessions where the acts of molestation occurred. The prosecution had concentrated on Sundays as that had been the day of the week that Ms C had indicated the individual training sessions to have taken place (before her belated recollection of the final session occurring instead on a Friday). Concentrating on dates from late January to end-March 2013, the prosecution excluded 27 January 2013, 10 February 2013 and 3 March 2013, as Mr Loh was demonstrably engaged in public sporting events, or otherwise indisposed. The defence which had, of course, contended that Mr Loh never conducted any private training sessions at all, would not disagree that no such training took place in the dates indicated above. In relation to their case, the projected dates put forward by the prosecution are:

> (a)     Second training session[^137]: **Sunday, 24 February 2013**

> (b)     Third training session[^138]: **Sunday, 10 March 2013**

> (c)     Fourth training session[^139]; **Friday, 15 March 2013**.

### Chronology of significant dates

125    The following is a chronology of events described in the prosecution’s case, (along with elements of defence’s alibi case in **_bold italics_** for juxtaposition) to allow a better appreciation of how the events play out in the factual matrix as a tool to facilitate analysis:

> (i)      **17 February 2013**\-First training session

> _\-Mr Loh proposes a ‘cool-down’ massage after session, no molestation alleged._

> **_\-Defence case- a group training had occurred at 3 pm at Tampines Stadium as evidenced by a message in Eugene Tan’s and Oon Kuan Yong’s mobile phones with Ms C being named as a participating trainee.[^140]_**

> (ii)      **24 February 2013**\-Second training session

> _\-Prosecution’s case: Mr Loh is alleged to have committed outrage of modesty per first charge._

> **_\-Defence case-Mr Loh had gone marketing and then celebrated “Chap Goh Mei”, the final day of Chinese New Year._**

> (iii)      **8 March 2013** _\-_Ms W messages Ms C about her own discomfiture while training with Mr Loh

> _\-In a WhatsApp message, Ms W tells Ms C “Oh Cause I wna double train (emoticon)” and “But I don’t wna do it alone”. The message pointed to Ms W having undergone individual training sessions and substantiating Ms W’s later testimony._

> (iv)      **10 March 2013**\- Third training session

> _\-Mr F, Ms C’s father had accompanied her to the individual training session, which he recalled was stymied by an episode of rain._

> _\-PW6 Meteorologist Ang Cheng Hai had testified that there had been 35 minutes of moderate rainfall from 5.00-6.00 pm (and light rain thereafter) around Tampines Stadium._

> **_\-Defence case-Mr Loh met Tan Wei Leong (DW7) at the Venus run on the morning of 10 March 2013 had lunch with him and had later gone to the Swift club meet at Toa Payoh Stadium from 2.00 p.m. to 4.00 p.m., and finally adjourned to a coffeeshop in the evening._**

> (v)      **15 March 2013**\- Fourth training session

> _\-Prosecution’s case: Mr Loh is alleged to have committed outrage of modesty per second charge._

## MATTERS IN PROSECUTION’S CASE WHICH WERE RELEVANT TO ACCUSED’S ALIBI DEFENCE

### Features of accused’s alibi defence

126    To preface the next part of these grounds, which will cover areas pertinent to the defence case of alibi, it would be _apropos_ to give a sense of their alibi defence, where a more detailed description will be set out later in these grounds. The defence’s case was essentially one of denial; Mr Loh denied that the acts of molestation had ever occurred. His case was that they could not have occurred because he had **_never_** conducted any individual training sessions with Ms C. In this regard, Mr Loh invoked a defence of **_alibi_**, which was premised on his being able to establish that he had otherwise involved at the dates and proximate times of that the offences in the two charges had been committed.

127    As mentioned in the preceding section, the prosecution had by extrapolation premised their case on the events on the first charge (the second training session) occurring on a Sunday 24 February 2013, and the events leading to the second charge (which was the final training session) to have occurred on 15 March 2013. For the **_former_**, Mr Loh had called his wife and his brother to be his alibi witnesses, as they had purportedly been celebrating a _Chap Goh Mei_ dinner in the late afternoon- early evening at 4.00-6.00 pm, with Mr Loh asserting also that he had been engaged in marketing expeditions earlier in the morning. For the **_latter_** date, Mr Loh had sought to show that he had been involved in training activities.

### Controversy in the actual date of the incident in the 2nd charge (C2); change of date from 17 March 2013 to 15 March 2013

128    Given the importance attached to dates for an alibi defence, the defence has taken issue over a turn of event in which Ms C having first identified the events in the second charge to have occurred on **_17 March 2013_**, which was a Sunday, made an about-turn midway in her testimony **_15 March 2013_**, which was a **_Friday_**. After affording her an opportunity to clarify, I accepted Ms C’s forthright explanation to be one of faulty reconstruction of connected events and making a faulty deduction from using the dates in her _WhatsApp_ chat as anchoring points. To be specific, Ms C had extrapolated the event to have taken place approximately two weeks before her messages to Mr A[^144] on 30 March 2013 but could not pin-point the exact date. She had later found her messages to Ms W on **_17 March 2013[^145]_** which included her message not to leave her alone to train. She had erroneously deduced that the last session had taken place on the same day; 17 March 2013.

129    As it was, the SPH Schools Relay involving schools which Mr Low was coaching was held on 16-17 March 2013, and there would have been no doubt that Mr Loh would have attended these events. Ms C had belatedly, on the fifth day of trial, begun to doubt that 17 March 2013 was the correct date for the final individual session. Ms C had asked for time to trawl through her documents and revised her stand to state that the last individual training session had occurred on **_15_** March 2013 and not **_17_** March 2013. The epiphany had occurred after counsel had brought to Ms C’s attention that she might have participated in a _Sprint Series 2_ competition on a Sunday.

130    While I was of the view that a court should not have ordinarily taken such a major about-turn lightly, or at least without thorough inquiry, Ms C was able to give compelling reasons for her lapse, as well as articulate her basis of belief for her new hypothesis that the session had been on 15 March 2013. Ms C had checked the Singapore Athletic Association’s schedules of competition for 2013 and noted that the SPH relay was at Bukit Gombak had indeed occurred on 16-17 March 2013. She had also noted the schools competing to be Catholic Junior College and CHIJ Toa Payoh, which were schools that the accused had been contracted to coach. In her own words[^146]:

> I mean Mr Loh would have been there for this competition. So because---so really to be fair to him and I really just want to say the truth … I went to double check my messages to see, …and I saw that I had a training with him on the 15th of March 2013.

131    Ms C had further explained that she had felt it less likely that a group training would have been held on Friday 15 March 2013, as the members of her training group might be participating for this competition on 16-17 March 2013, and they would not have been training with her on 15 March 2013. It was the conventional practice for an athlete not to train on the day before a competition, as to be able to present themselves rested, and in their best form for the competition itself.

### Proof that PW3 was not training but otherwise engaged on 17 March 3013

132    After being given time, Ms C produced documentary proof of the following activities.

> \-    In the morning of 17 March 2013, Ms C had been engaged as a lector undertaking Scripture-reading duties in her church.[^147] Ms C had produced a lector reading schedule from 16 March 2013 to 28 April 2013, and she had been engaged in the first reading for the day in a service which lasted from 8.30 am to 9.30 am. Lector readers were expected to stay for the entire service.

> \-    Ms C had after returning home from church, accessed and printed her A level result transcript. She could show that she had converted one of her files from a JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) file to a TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) document with the date of creation of the document evidenced by an annotation “_Modified Sunday, 17th of March 2013 at 10:28 AM_”.[^148] Ms C had shortly thereafter received an Online Image Converter report on her email, at 11.11 am notifying of the successful conversion of the file.

> \-    The complainant had testified that she had joined her mother and sister to watch a musical; _‘Le Noir’[^149]_ at Marina Bay Sands’ Masterpiece Theatre at 3.00 pm on 17 March 2013. For that, she had found a photographic image of her and her sister at Marina Bay Sands[^150].

### Chain of messages on 15 March 2013 from Twitter account

133    Perhaps the most significant discovery in Ms C’s quest to establish the date of the final training session had been her discovery of a long-forgotten post in her since defunct Twitter account. The complainant had on **_15 March 2013_** at 9.24 pm, posted in her Twitter account stating, “**_Prettiest crescent moon ever and so many stars in the sky_**”[^151]. This post attracted a response from “Iggy” or Ignatius, a member of the training group to inquire “**_How was your time trial_**?” Ms C had then responded by stating that she had found the time trial “_surprisingly easy only 80 x 3_”. This denoting that she had completed three sets of 80 metre sprints. She had then bid “Iggy” “_all the best_” for the SPH run.

134    Although Ms C’s response to “Iggy” of the ‘_surprisingly easy_’ series of 80 metre sprints appeared to show her own acknowledgment at the time that she had participated in a training activity, she could not recall much of the background circumstances of her exchange. Even as the prosecution had locked in on the message showing a **_training event_** having occurred on **_15 March 2013_**, counsel had taken the opportunity to latch onto the apparent incongruity of Ms C making references to the appearance of the moon and stars, Ms C gave a trenchant response which was entirely in keeping with her stated basis for coming forward[^152], and it was her unerring consistency which contributed to my view that Ms C could be regarded as an **_unusually convincing_** witness on the strength of her testimony, when analysed with the supporting evidence, as well as the case presented by the defence, within the factual matrix of the case:

>   
| 

Counsel:

 | 

You’re feeling so grossed out but you were still in a mood to admire the moon, is that correct?

 |
| 

Ms C

 | 

Maybe I just wanted to, um, cast aside, the like gross things and focused on positive acts---aspects of life.

 |
| 

Counsel:

 | 

But it is something that is grossed that happened, you cannot just cast it aside---

…

 |
| 

Ms C

 | 

Maybe that’s your own perspective in life.

 |
| 

Counsel:

 | 

And if you can cast it aside, why are you here today?

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

**_Because I realised that I don’t want it on my conscience if he did it to other people._**

 |
| 

Counsel:

 | 

So when you are in a very upset mood, when you are unhappy when there’s such a violation on your body, you would not be in a mood to be looking at the prettiest crescent moon ever.

…

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

Well, I disagree because this is what I did and, I personally don’t see that there’s anything wrong with it …and I don’t think that there’s anything to hide ,,, this was just me (at) 18…

\[Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

135    Ms C could not recall if she had specifically told “Iggy” about the time trial before his response to her post. She believed that it was _“most likely_” the accused who had told her directly that her training on 15 March 2013 would involve a time trial. Ms C indicated that she could not recall the specific workout on 15 March 2013 from memory, as trainees were subject to a range of workouts each day but did believe from her own tweet that the training had involved three 80 metre sprints within a time trial. Her reasoning was that “Iggy” would not have inquired with her about such an event, unless her he had been told by her or been informed from another source.

### How a time trial can be performed with just two persons present in the stadium

136    Ms C refuted[^153] counsel’s contention that a time trial would have required **_three_** persons, with the complement of coach and trainee supplemented by at least one helper to monitor the starting line, She indicated that a time-trial could be modified for just a two-person group of coach and trainee, with the trainee signalling her start by hand signals. For this modified time-trial, she would not assume a crouched position, but instead perform a “_three-point start_” with one arm in the air. To signal a start she would drop that hand down, allowing the coach, who was taking the timing a cue as to when to press the timer. I would observe that Ms W was not familiar with this improvised method for time trials but it was also the case that her track events were different from Ms C in that she ran substantially longer distances. Ultimately, I would not find the method described by Ms C to seem viable if the objective was just to get a sense of athletic performance during a training exercise. What was notable from the series of Twitter messages is was the fact that a time trial could only be conducted in the presence of a coach (who would be holding the stopwatch), and Mr Loh had been the only coach training Ms C.

### Another WhatsApp fragment shows sequence of events leading to the individual training session between accused and PW3 at Tampines Stadium on 15 March 2013

137    It would also be appropriate to look at another set of _WhatsApp_ messages that Ms C recovered from her archives[^154]:

>   
| 

15/3/13 9:47:35 am:

 | 

“wee hong”: (Ms C’s name)

 |
| 

15/3/13 9:47:44 am:

 | 

“wee hong”: Is mr loh training at bishan today?

 |
| 

15/3/13 10:04:58 am:

 | 

(Ms C): I’m not sure

 |
| 

15/3/13 10:06:

 |
| 

15/3/13 1:53: 13 pm**_:_**

 | 

(Ms C): **_Tampines!!_**

 |
|

 | 

“wee hong”: **_Seriously!? Haha he told Zaki and the ntu boys no training hahaha_**

 |

 |

15/3/13 3:34:02 pm:

 | 

“wee hong”: **_:( I’m not going, Cause he said ntu boys today don’t need to come. Just come on sat._**

 |

  
  

### Significance of the WhatsApp exchange on 15 March 2013

138    What is significant in this exchange between Ms C and fellow trainee “_wee hong_” (who was Mr Toh Wee Hong) is the fact that Ms C’s response to his question at 1.53.13 pm, would apparently show that Mr Loh **_had arranged a training session on the day itself in Tampines_**. This is despite the fact that Friday 15 March 2013 was the eve of the SPH Relay events on 16-17 March 2013. This is within the context that all parties accepted that group training activities would be generally curtailed, or otherwise limited, on the eve of track events, especially if the trainees would also be participating in these sporting events.

### The chain of text messages showed how a potential group training session became an individual session in Tampines on 15 March 2013

139    It was therefore noteworthy that “Wee Hong” had still raised the inquiry as to whether Mr Loh would be conducting training at **_Bishan_** in what he evidently believed would be **_a group_** training session. At 10.04 am, Ms C was herself **_unaware_** if any session was to be held that day, as evidenced with her _“I’m not sure_” response. Ms C would only know of the venue almost **_four hours_** later at 1.53pm when she had responded to “Wee Hong’s” last message at 10.06 am with her exclaimed message informing of the venue as “**_Tampines!!_**”

140    “Wee Hong’s” response was one of surprise, as he had, in the interim, apparently made his own inquires, and informed Ms C that Mr Loh had apparently told “_zaki_” (Zaki Sapari) and the “_ntu boys_” that there would **_be no training_** that day. Ms C’s response had been to acknowledge that “_zaki_” and Ms W had been told by Mr Loh to rest as they had been training hard. She had evidently been unaware of the “_ntu boys_” being told that there was “_no training_” and reposed the hope that “Wee Hong” himself could attend stating “_I missed last two days so gotta go_**_, are you going!!! :)_**”. “Wee Hong’s” response that he was that he was not going “_Cause he said ntu boys today don’t_ **_need_** _to come”._ His response would imply that Mr Loh had left the option of going for group training on 15 March 2013 open to “Wee Hong”.

141    Notwithstanding the option he had extended for “Wee Hong” to attend, Mr Loh had not seemed especially **_keen_** to proceed with a group training session and had had variously told the “_ntu boys_” that there would be “_no training_” and had dissuaded the remainder of his athletes from training, advising “_zaki_” and Ms W to rest as the two had been “_training hard_”. “Wee Hong” had thus taken his cue from the message to the “_ntu boys_” that there had been no “**_need_** _to come_” that day, had thus opted not to attend. That, of course, left Ms C as the **_sole_** trainee.

142    As mentioned, “_wee hong_” was incidentally one Toh Wee Hong (Zhuo Weifeng), whom Ms C had recalled as having come from NTU[^155], and who had tendered a conditioned statement[^156] concerning images[^157] of Ms C in several social media posts that he had shared with the defence team. There was no question that he would have been available to be their witness to shed light on his test exchange with Ms C. It was therefore surprising that “_wee hong_”, the only other contributor in the message chain was not called as a defence witness. The chain had essentially seen “_wee hong_” acknowledge Ms C’s message that there would be a training event on 15 March 2013 at Tampines. This would be readily recognizable as a critical aspect of the defence’s reliance on alibi in their case, with 15 March 2013 being crucially, the projected date of the second alleged act molestation. The defence had called DW 6; Oon Kuan Yong, who had testified to the accused’s erratic manner for fixing training times and venues[^158]. Mr Oon’s evidence was that while the location for the next session was often communicated at the close of a group session, these venues were not always fixed beforehand. In his words “_sometimes…maybe we still haven’t already decide, uh, where to train, then_, (Mr Loh) _would tell us that he would text us and inform us about it_” The mode of conveyance of these messages could also vary, with the accused sometimes texting or calling one or two trainees for them to pass on the message on the location of the next session, Trainees could also call Mr Loh or core group trainees directly for information of the training venue. There would therefore be a considerable document trial of these schedulings.

143    In this context it is surprising that the defence was unable to obtain any text communications from any messaging platforms in relation to the arrangements for 15 **_March_** 2013. The _WhatsApp_ message trail between Ms C and “_wee hong_" had referenced or inferred communications between Mr Loh and Ms C, Ms W, “_the ntu boys_”, “_zaki_” and “_wee hong_”. I can see that the accused would have likely had no difficulty in recovering evidence of these disseminated instructions, given that he was able to source text messages for training arrangements on 16 **_February_** 2013 and 23 **_February_** 2013 between himself and DW5; Oon Kuan Yong and DW10; Eugene Tan[^159]. I would note that Mr Loh’s _alibi_ for the date and time was that he was coaching students of CHIJ Toa Payoh from 3.30 to 6.30 pm, which the defence claims to be his **_regular_** schedule. It thus begs the question why “_wee hong_” should have posed the question whether there would be group training in Bishan in the first place and start the chain of inquiry which would end with Ms C exclaiming “_Tampines !!_”.

## DEFENCE CASE

### Submission of no case

144    Upon the conclusion of the prosecution’s case, the defence mounted a submission of no case to answer. The lengthy submission covered a number of perceived deficiencies in, _inter alia_, the quality of Ms C’s evidence, emphasizing such aspects as her about-turn in respect of the second charge from 17 March 2013 to 15 March 2013, as well as highlighting certain intemperate remarks Ms C had made about punishing sexual offenders and her repetition of an account of sexual misconduct by a celebrity within the collection of _WhatsApp_ communications between Ms C and Ms W, which, in their view, made her an unreliable witness.

### Response by the prosecution

145    DPP Gail Wong countered with an address which emphasized the limited scope of inquiry to the consideration of whether a _prima facie_ case had been established which satisfied every element of each of the proceeded charges, stating as follows[^160]:

> 1    Section 230(1)(j) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68, 2012 Rev. Ed.) (“the CPC”) states that the Court must call on the accused to give his defence if it is of the view that t**here is some evidence which is not inherently incredible and which satisfies each and every element of the charge as framed by the prosecutor or as altered or framed by the court.** In the absence of this, the Court is then to order a discharge amounting to total acquittal (_cf_. s 230(1)(k) of the CPC).

> 2    This in essence sets out the test in **_Haw Tua Tau v PP_** **\[1981-1982\] SLR(R) 133**, as explained by Chan CJ as he then was, in **_Re: Nalpon Zero Geraldo Mario_** **<span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 440</span>** at \[26\]. The determining question is as stated by Chan CJ:

>> “Not whether the evidence as it presently stood had already established the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt **but whether the evidence – if it were all accepted as accurate – would do so**.”

> At a minimum, the evidence has to cover every constituent element of the offence in question. Regard has to be had to the following guiding propositions:

>> a)    All evidence of primary fact should be accepted as being true, unless it is so inherently incredible that no reasonable person would be able to accept it as being true or if it has been discredited or shown to be wholly unreliable. This may happen, for example, during the course of cross-examination.

>> b)    Nothing to displace those inferences reasonably drawn from the primary facts itself Inferences may be drawn – only if they are reasonable. Not necessary that the inference be irresistible.

>> c)    Totality of evidence has to be considered.

> 3.    The assessment required is just a **minimum evaluation of the evidence as a whole (****_PP v IC Automation (S) Pte Ltd_** **1996 2 SLR(R) 799**).

> \[Emphasis in the original\]

146    The learned DPP also gave an incisive _precis[^161]_ on what the prosecution had established in respect of each ingredient of the offence, and how this had been accomplished.

147    I was of the opinion that the prosecution’s position was right on the law, and that it would be entirely inappropriate to undertake a granular analysis of specific deficiencies that the defence had alluded to, where holistic analysis of the prosecution’s case of the evidence of Ms C, her parents, Ms W, and Mr A would show _per_ the guiding principles of _Hua Tua Tau v PP_ and more recent elucidating authorities, that there was a considerable body of testimonial, documentary and circumstantial evidence in relation to the proceeded charges which required a response from the accused. I was also satisfied that no aspect of the evidence was inherently incredible, nor did the adduced evidence leave any element of the charges in want.

148    Accordingly, I ruled that a _prima facie_ case had been established and called upon Mr Loh to enter his defence. After the allocution had been administered, Mr Loh signalled that he would give evidence in his own defence.

### Introduction

149    The defence was essentially one which spanned two distinct prongs. One prong was Mr Loh’s defence that he had an _alibi_ for the dates where he was alleged to have committed the acts of molestation, which were of course Sunday, **_24 February 2013_** and **_Friday 15 March 2013_**. As Mr Loh’s contention was that he had never held an individual training session with Ms C, he would also claim to have an alibi for **_10 March 2013_**, the date identified by the prosecution as the occasion the third individual session had been conducted. The other prong was concerned primarily with questioning the credibility of the complainant and Ms W. The accused did not give any clear theory as to the possible motivation for the complainant coming forward with the accusations, save that she might have harboured some dissatisfaction and _animus_ against him, after she had intimated that Ms C was not likely to become competitive as a national level athlete. I will first deal with the _alibi_ defence, since they involve a juxtaposition of what each side contends occurred over three short and **_discrete_** spans of time and would entail a straightforward analysis. The latter analysis would call for a more forensic analysis of the dynamics of the training relationship between Ms C and Mr Loh prior to, during and in the aftermath of the alleged acts complained of.

## ALIBI DEFENCE

150    The parameters of the alibi are explicitly stated at \[52\] to \[53\] of the Submissions of Defence, which was an explicit and categorical denial stated as follows[^162]:

> 52.    The Accused denies committing the two offences from the inception.

> 53.    Further the Accused could not have done so and was not present during the dates and times he was being accused of the molests.

### Alibi evidence in response to the first charge (24 February 2013)

151    There is no dispute that 24 February 2013 had been ‘_Chap Goh Meh’_, which was the vernacular term for the final day of the Lunar New Year. Mr Loh’s claim was that he had was a family tradition to celebrate the first and fifteenth day of Chinese New Year with his extended family. On the fifteenth day of Chinese New Year, he had gone marketing for some two hours to two different markets, as he had done for the past 40 years. Dinner would be served between 4.00 to 6.00 pm[^163]. Mr Loh’s principal _alibi_ witnesses were DW3, Mdm Khng Lay Hua, his wife who had stated that Mr Loh had been with her from the time she returned home after church in the mid-morning, to accompany her for marketing and later at home preparing for _‘Chap Goh Mei_’ prayers and dinner; and DW4 Mr Loh Sian Kok.

### Evidence of DW4 Low Sian Kok

152    Mr Loh’s brother, who had stated that he had gone to the Mr Loh’s residence for ‘_Chap Goh Mei_’ prayers and dinner. Mr Loh Sian Kok had indicated that the relatives had congregated at Mr Loh’s apartment as their ancestor’s tablet had been emplaced there.

153    Curiously, Mr Loh Sian Kok made no reference to the accused being in his residence when he arrived in his initial response to counsel’s question at his examination-in-chief[^164]:

>   
| 

Counsel:

 | 

In year 2013, you say you were in his house around 3 plus? Who else were with you or were you there alone?

 |
| 

Mr Loh Sian Kok:

 | 

**_My 2nd elder sister, my wife. Alright, tha---that’s all._**

 |
| 

Counsel:

 | 

And after you arrived what did you do?

 |
| 

Mr Loh Sian Kok:

 | 

Uh, generally, we will have a---a chat and then have tea until---until, uh, 5---a 5pm, uh, 6pm. Uh, after the, uh, after praying to the ancestors, we will have the dinner.

 |
| 

\[Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

154    There was no doubt that Mr Low Sian Kok’s evidence-in-chief was that he **_did_** at some point chat with his brother, but he did not specify **_when_** Mr Loh had appeared at the scene. DW4 had spoken to the accused, as his intent, other than the usual matters they would ordinarily chat about, was to announce that he was going to the city of Boston in the United States. He would be accompanying his wife, who would be receiving an award from her employer, Liberty Mutual, an insurance corporation. Mr Low Sian Kok had wished to “_share his joy_” with Mr Loh, as the Chairman’s Award was the highest honour conferred by the corporation, he had also planned to visit an aunt in New York.[^165] Mr Low Sian Kok indicated that he had intended to borrow a jacket from Mr Loh for the occasion. While DW4 referred to a suit, he had not borrowed a pair of matching trousers He had recalled this loan with some certitude:

>   
| 

Counsel

 | 

Where did you get the suit? Your suit?

 |
| 

Mr Loh Sian Kok

 | 

This suit, I borrowed this suit from my elder brother.

….

 |
| 

Counsel:

 | 

When did you borrow it from Mr. Loh Siang Piow?

 |
| 

Mr Loh Sian Kok:

 | 

**_On…15th day of the first Lunar month of the year._** That is _Yuan Xiao_ Festival, during the _Yuan Xiao_ Festival. I borrow this jacket or suit from him.

 |
| 

Counsel

 | 

Is this the only occasion that you have borrowed a suit from Mr. Loh Siang Piow?

 |
| 

Mr Loh Sian Kok:

 | 

Yes---yes, that was the only occasion.

…

 |
| 

Counsel

 | 

And why do you need to borrow the suit from Mr. Loh Siang Piow?

 |
| 

Mr Loh Sian Kok

 | 

Yes, for that occasion, I have to be prop---formally---appropriate attire and…I have to wear the suit.

 |
| 

….

 | 

 |
| 

Mr Loh Sian Kok

After offering a prayers, after having the---the dinner 5---5, 6:00, I leave at about---after having that dinner, at about 7pm, I leave---I will leave generally the house.

 |
| 

Counsel

 | 

Sure. Alright? And Are you able to recall who else was there **_for the dinner_**?

 |
| 

Mr Loh Sian Kok:

 | 

Myself, my wife and my 2nd eldest sister and Mr. Loh---and my elder brother’s family.

 |

  
  

155    The timeline, excluding the loan of the jacket, according to the accused and his wife, would run as follows:

>   
| 

Before 10am:

 | 

DW3 Mdm Khng went to church

 |
| 

10 am:

 | 

Mdm Khng and Mr Loh went marketing to two distinct locations at Pasir Ris Drive 6 and Tampines roundabout market[^166]

 |
| 

12 noon:

 | 

Mr Loh and Mdm Khng reached home.

 |
| 

2.00 pm:

 | 

Food and prayers ready

 |
| 

“_3 plus_” pm:

 | 

Loh Sian Kok arrived early at the premises at “_three plus to four_ (in the afternoon)” and the two began “_chit-chatting_” [^167]

 |
| 

5.00pm:

 | 

Other participating relatives arrive, for a total of eight persons, including brother and their wives, sister, daughters, son-in-law, and granddaughter[^168]

 |
| 

6.00-6.30pm:

 | 

Dinner and “chit-chat” among the relatives with Mr Loh Sian Kok leaving at 7.00pm and the others leaving later

 |

  
  

156    Mr Loh himself indicated that he could not clearly remember the sequence of events during the ‘_Chap Goh Mei’_ observance on 24 February 2013, but his memory had been jotted by his brother; Mr Loh Sian Kok having specially came because he wanted to borrow “something” from him, without specifying what that was. In his own words: “_I just it---I just remember that---that---that’s all I---I can’t remember anything, but I remember my brother come and went to borrows something from me, that’s all_.”[^169]

157    DW3, Mdm Khng, a professed Roman Catholic, who respected her husband’s observance of Taoist rites, stated that she could recall the events in 2013, as Mr Loh’s brother, Mr Loh Sian Kok had come to borrow a jacket that day. She could also recall Mr Loh Sian Kok trying on a number of jackets for fit and chatting with Mr Loh.[^170] The rest of Mdm Khng’s recollection appeared to be a recitation of things that the family would **_normally_** do at ‘_Chap Goh Mei’_ as the DPP wryly put “_from muscle memory_”[^171] where she would prepare Hainanese dishes with the traditional ‘three meats’ and Mr Loh would be expected to open up a fold-out table for the occasion, and lay out the delicacies. Other than Mr Loh Sian Kok’s loan of the jacket, nothing stood out to distinguish that occasion from the other occasions commemorating the end of Chinese New Year. Mdm Khng merely alluded to Mr Loh being around to assist her and set up the table but appeared unable to explain any distinguishing aspect which would jot her memory (aside from Mr Loh Sian Kok’s loan of the jacket) from the years when ‘_Chap Goh Meh’_ had also fallen on a Sunday, where she would invariably go attend a church service alone.

### No objective proof of accounts of DW3 and DW4

158    Despite their bid to establish an alibi by citing ‘_Chap Goh Mei’_ preparations and celebrations, there was, however, no timestamped photograph or text message showing the time that the relatives came or even planned to meet, which might have corroborated their presence at the critical times of late morning or late afternoon-early evening. The corroboration would be important given the standard of proof of a balance of probabilities for alibi defences.

### The date of borrowing of Mr Loh’s jacket is dis-synchronous from time of notice of event jacket was borrowed for

159    The unifying aspect of the evidence of DW1, Mr Loh, DW 3, Mdm Khng and DW 4, Mr Low Sian Kok was their account of the latter’s borrowing of a jacket from his elder brother. This would of course not have established the time Mr Loh Sian Kok arrived at the apartment on 24 February 2013, much less **_prove_** that Mr Loh never left his residence at any point in the morning or afternoon where the alleged act of molestation could have been perpetrated at a private training session. It would at most place Mr Loh Sian Kok at the residence on ‘_Chap Goh Mei_’. Even this could not be established, as a glaring **_discrepancy_** became evident when Mr Loh Sian Kok sought to prove his borrowing of the jacket by the presentation of a letter (Exhibit D45) which was dated **_11 March_** 2013, addressed from his wife’s Alicia Koh’s company, Liberty Mutual Insurance, to her, where she had been notified that she would receive an award in the United States for her outstanding contributions. The letter[^172] reads:

> **_March 11, 2013_**

> Alicia Koh

> Manager

> Liberty Insurance SINGAPORE

> Dear Alicia

> Congratulations on being selected to receive the 2012 Chairman’s Award,

> The award is the highest honour we bestow upon employees who have made unique and inspirational contributions to the Liberty Mutual Insurance. Your outstanding contributions, along with those of your fellow recipients, continue to help us achieve our vision of being an organisation of people who are committed and know how to meet the diverse and changing needs of our customers.

> Under separate cover, **_you will receive details_** concerning the award presentation and celebration activities scheduled in Boston from May 9th to May 11th 2013. **_You also will receive information_** about the 2012 Chairman’s Award Website, which describes the event and allows you to make reservations for the activities available to you while you are in Boston.

> Again, congratulations and thank you for your outstanding contributions. We look forward to meeting with you in May.

> Sincerely…

> \[Emphasis added\]

160    The defence case is that Mr Loh Sian Kok had indicated that he had sought to borrow a jacket for the event, which was scheduled to take place from 9 to 11 May 2013. The obvious problem with this account would be that the letter had been dated some **_three weeks after_** 24 February 2013. Loh Sian Kok would therefore not have had the **_prescience_** to foresee the event to ask to borrow the jacket on 24 February 2013. There is nothing in the document that suggests any **_prior_** communication of the award or trip. The prospectively couched intimation that “_you will receive details_” suggests that the letter was the **_first_** communication heralding Ms Alicia Koh’s award. While Mr Loh Sian Kok had attached images of himself wearing the jacket he identified to belong to his elder brother in Boston in May 2013, they lent nothing to the elder Mr Loh’s _alibi_ defence. Simply stated, if DW1, DW3 and DW4 could have been wrong about this detail, the alibi witnesses’ ability to recall actual events as against their ingrained impressions of what **_usually_** happened in such festivities in past years, in particular whether Mr Loh left the apartment at any time of the day, must be strongly suspect. I would note again that Mr Loh resided in Pasir Ris, which was just **_one_** MRT stop from Tampines.

### Verdict on alibi for 24 February 2013

161    Given the above, I was of the view that Mr Loh has **_not_** proven his asserted _alibi_ on 24 February 2013 on a balance of probabilities.

### Alibi for 2nd Charge (C2) (15 March 2013)

162    In respect of the second charge, Mr Loh sought to prove that he had been in Bishan Stadium at the material time, which was projected by the prosecution to be in the afternoon of 15 March 2013. Mr Loh’s alibi case rested on two different bases. One was that he had been conducting a **_training session_** for CHIJ Toa Payoh students that afternoon. The second basis was that he thereafter had a **_meeting_** with DW2 Terry Tan in the latter’s car, outside Bishan Stadium.

### Evidence of DW2 Terry Tan Kok Beng

163    For the latter basis, the defence had called DW2, Mr Tan Kok Beng Terry. Mr Tan was a Deputy Superintendent in the Prison Service, having joined the service in 1999. In March 2013, Mr Tan was the officer-in-charge (OC) of Echo housing unit in Tanah Merah Prison. The Echo housing unit functioned to allow a special regime known as administrative segregation regime to house a special group of individuals Mr Tan referred to as “_high profile prisoners_”[^173] as well as those who exhibited violent tendencies. Mr Tan was a friend as well as a fellow office holder at the Singapore Athletic Association. The gist of Mr Tan’s account was his recollection that had waited in his car for a training session which Mr Tan was undertaking at Bishan Stadium to finish, held a meeting inside the car, then sent Mr Loh back to his residence.

### Reference to “meeting” in response to a trainee requesting information if training would be conducted on 15 March 2013

164    To prove[^174] that he would be engaged in a meeting, Mr Loh had exhibited an exchange of messages[^175] with a trainee, one Tan Tze Jung, dated 15 March 2013, where he had, at 11.07, stated that he had a “_meeting_” and his admonition for the trainee to “_take a break today_”. For completeness, the inquiring and response messages run as follows:

>   
| 

15/03/2013 11.00 (Tan Tze Jung)

 | 

Good morning mr loh. **_Can I check with you whether there is training today?_**

 |
| 

15/03/2013 11.07 (Accused)

 | 

**_Take a break today. I have mee(t)ing[^176]_**. Tmr I have trg in bukit Gombak at 8.30 am. Pl inform samuel and wee hong.

 |
| 

 | 

\[Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

165    My first observation is that the message, where Mr Loh brushed aside the trainee’s desire for clarification on whether training would be held on that day; 15 March 2013, did tear against the central premise of Mr Loh’s other prong of his _alibi_ case; that he **_was in fact engaged in a training_** session at Bishan Stadium that very day. My second observation would be that this message is entirely consistent with the chain of messages between Ms C and “Wee Hong” exhibited above[^177], where Ms C had apparently ended up alone in Tampines Stadium because Mr Loh’s private trainees including the NTU students were told that they “_don’t need to come_”.[^178] Mr Loh had of course not given a hard “no” on the query as to training, but had deflected by referencing his having a “_meeting_” to follow his injunction to “_Take a break today_”

166    Given that Mr Loh had claimed to be in Bishan Stadium in the afternoon of 15 March 2013, it is not altogether clear why Mr Tan Tze Jung’s seeming desire to train could not be accommodated by Mr Loh at the very premises he was allegedly in. Bishan Stadium is, of course, a **_public_** facility which would be open to all. Incidentally, Ms C had even recalled training at the track in CHIJ (Toa Payoh) and Catholic Junior College[^179] as one of Mr Loh’s private students despite school grounds being usually regarded as a more cloistered and restricted environment. The bottom line is that there ought to have been nothing to prevent Mr Tan Tze Jung from training in the afternoon of 15 March 2013, if Mr Loh himself had indeed been training CHIJ (Toa Payoh) athletes in Bishan Stadium. I do recognise from private students, with their differing work and education commitments, might not **_start_** at exactly the same time as the school students, with Ms W stating that she usually started afternoon sessions at 4.00 pm to 5.00pm, and would end at “_6.00 pm plus_” to 7.00pm[^180]. Ms C herself had started closer to 5.00pm as she had to come from internship duties, from which she was released at 4.00-4.30 pm. Mr Oon Kuan Yong indicated that NTU students would tend to start later, as they had to commute from their university, adding that while Friday sessions were from 3.30 to “_around 5.30_” pm, NTU athletes might go there even after 5.30 “_if we can’t make it for the_ (3.30 pm-5.30 pm_) session_”.[^181] Given the flexibility of time allowed for private trainees to join the training, which spanned from 3.30pm to after 5.00pm, it would thus have seemed reasonable for Mr Loh to tell Mr Tan Tze Jung **_when_** he would expect to end his school training and when the “_meeting_” was to have been held, **_if_** indeed the two events **_had_** been in his schedule for the afternoon-evening of 15 March 2013. This would enable Mr Tan Tze Jung to consider if he could have made it for the training that he sought.

### The text message did not specify when or why the “meeting” was being held or who the accused had arranged to meet

167    While Mr Loh has sought to demonstrate that the text message was proof that he had ‘met’ Mr Terry Tan to discuss a controversy over competing organisations seeking to hold tug of war competitions, there is no reference to Mr Loh meeting Mr Tan in the message. It thus remained for Mr Tan to fill in the gaps.

### Reason given by DW 2 for meeting the accused

168    Mr Tan stated that he had become involved in an _imbroglio_ over his attempts to promote _tug of war_ as a sporting activity in Singapore. Mr Tan had been the vice president of the Tug of War Association Singapore. He had sought to organise an event to showcase _tug of war_ to raise awareness and attract interest from athletes and the members of public. He had planned a demonstration of this activity around 16-17 March 2013, but that had not materialised as he was unable to muster full teams of competitors to come down for the event as most were from the prisons service and worked shifts, Nevertheless he had organised events such as a _tug of war_ umpiring course conducted by Taiwanese experts, as evidenced by reportage in an article on the 12 March 2013 edition of the _Straits Times_ headlined “_Getting a Good Grip”_[^182].These activities had aroused the ire of a competing tug of war federation, the _Tug of War Federation Singapore_ as evidenced by another article in the Straits Times creatively entitled “_War over Tug of War”_, which ran the very next day; 13 March 2013. According to Mr Tan this situation “_sparkled(_sic_) a lot of debates…and discussion over…who is the relevant body for tug of war in Singapore_”.[^183]

### Specific details of meeting between DW2 and Mr Loh

169    Mr Tan had thus felt constrained to seek Mr Loh’s advice. He had accordingly arranged to meet Mr Loh on 15 March 2013. In his own words Mr Tan states[^184]:

>   
| 

Counsel:

 | 

Where did you meet up with Mr. Loh?

 |
| 

Mr Tan

 | 

Oh, I met up with him at Bishan Stadium I drove there, so once I reached Bishan Stadium at the car park I gave him a call. **_But he told him he was still, uh, coaching. Give him, uh, 5 to 10 minutes, so I waited for him, uh, inside my car._**

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

Counsel:

 | 

When he appeared?

 |
| 

Mr Tan

 | 

Maybe about 6:00 or 6:05.

 |
| 

Counsel

 | 

Where did the discussion take place?

 |
| 

Mr Tan

 | 

**_Uh, after his training, he look for me at my car and from there I send him off to his house. So during the journey, um, we---we had some discussion_** and---and, uh, we continue our discussion, uh, after we have reached, uh, Mr. Loh’s house in Pasir Ris.

 |

  
  

170    Mr Tan estimated that he had reached Pasir Ris “_maybe 10, 15 minutes before 7_ (pm)”. The two men had outstanding matters to discuss, and they had gone on to discuss even after they had reached the intended destination. Mr Tan had parked his car at the car park, beneath Mr Loh’s apartment. He had then “_stopped there for a while”_ for continued discussion which lasted “_about 20 to 30 minutes_”. He had finally left “_about 7:20 to 7:30_ (pm)” Mr Tan added that he had also ascertained what needed to be done for the SPH relay event scheduled on 16-17 March 2013.

### The meeting required an implausibly disproportionate amount of time and effort on DW2’s part

171    Despite the length of the conversation, which represented in Mr Tan’s account to extend to about an hour-and-a-half, it transpired that Mr Loh’s advice was fairly straightforward as to be encapsulable in a **_single_** sentence. It was Mr Tan’s evidence that[^185]

> **_The recommendation and advice_**, uh, **_given by Mr. Loh back then was_** to, uh, **_for SAA to write officially to Sports SG_** to seek---**_to seek their advice and recommendation_**. So thereafter---after this, uh, some discussion between our GM and Sports SG, so it was agreed that tug of war should come under SAA and that means SAA as the governing body for tug of war in Singapore.

172    It thus seemed peculiar that Mr Tan, a DSP of Prisons who assumed heavy responsibilities as OC of a unit having charge of special population of “high-profile” and sensitive prisoners, would find it in himself to undertake such a journey on 15 March 2013 to attend a **_two-person_** meeting in his own car, after having been made to wait outside Bishan Stadium for Mr Loh to finish. This was particularly so when a **_call_** or **_text_** should have sufficed to convey Mr Loh’s simple message for the Singapore Athletic Association to formally correspond with Sports SG to “_seek their advice and recommendation_”. I had no doubt from the exhibits that Mr Loh was adept in messaging, with his messages tending to be succinct and to-the-point.

173    DPP Gail Wong also latched on the incongruity of prosecuting such a circuitous journey to Bishan Stadium in Central-North Singapore, when both Mr Loh and Mr Tan stayed in the **_East_**. Mr Tan confirmed that he had stayed in special State quarters for senior prison officials at Tanah Merah, adjacent to his place of work. Upon her questions, Mr Loh simply attributed Mr Terry Tan’s willingness to oblige him because Mr Tan owned a car and he had called upon Mr Tan to pick him up: The following also gives a good illustration of Mr Loh’s rather argumentative manner in responding to questions raised at cross-examination [^186]

>   
| 

DPP

 | 

**_Why couldn’t you meet Terry in the East? You were staying in Pasir Ris, right? So, why you couldn’t just meet ‘Terry’ in the East?_**

 |
| 

Mr Loh:

 | 

Oh, that---you---you---they come down and picked me. They got car, I got no car, they come down and picked me. I said---said, “You come down, you pi---pick me there.” Always these people---these people all come, they got car, they will pick me. When competition everything they will come and pick me. And then also, I’m---in---in---in Bishan.

 |
| 

DPP

 | 

And why did you need to have this discussion on the tug of war issues as you claim in the car?

 |
| 

Mr Loh

 | 

Why can’t I discuss in the car? It’s between he and me. We have discussed our---our plan, our strategies in the same time, I will saved time. What---why we cannot discuss in the car?

 |
| 

DPP:

 | 

As in, why you didn’t you go somewhere---

 |
| 

Mr Loh

 | 

Why---why---

must I---why---why must I go somewhere?

 |
| 

\[Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

### Absence of documentary trail directly referencing the time and venue of meeting on 15 March 2013

174    Unlike the messages which Ms C produced of a chat with Mr Toh Wee Hong apparently showing a scheduled session at Tampines on 15 March 2013, Mr Tan’s account of having driven to Bishan Stadium at Mr Loh’s behest and fetching him from Bishan Stadium to remain merely testimonial in nature, as Mr Tan had “_traded-in_”[^187] his _i-Phone_ for a new mobile device and had, in a lapse I found somewhat surprising for a high-ranking civil servant holding a key appointment in the Prisons Service, not thought to **_back up_** the data in his previous phone. His account is thus unsupported by directly cogent documentary evidence, such as a text confirming the rendezvous with Mr Loh at Bishan stadium in the late afternoon or early evening of 15 March 2013, or indeed any call records between the two to back up his claim that he had called Mr Loh upon arriving at his destination, and had been asked to wait for another five to ten minutes.

### The connection between the message and the claimed meeting at Bishan is tenuous

175    All that is evident to the court is that this aspect of the _alibi_ defence was a loose and tenuous connection which started with an inherently contradictory message exchange between a trainee and Mr Loh where the latter had given the impression to the trainee (in response to the trainee’s query if training was to be held that day) that he would be otherwise **_engaged_** in an unspecified “meeting”, even while Mr Loh’s other _alibi_ case is that he was **_actually_** training a cadre of students of CHIJ Toa Payoh at Bishan Stadium. The defence then sought to have this rather ambiguous reference to a “meeting” in the message tethered to a claimed “meeting” brought upon by a chain of events involving politicking among two rival _tug of war_ associations in the proximate period in mid-March 2013. While there had been some press reportage around 12-13 March 2013, it seemed peculiar that the situation was one which required Mr Tan to drive from Eastern Singapore to Bishan Stadium, wait for Mr Loh, hold a **_two-person_** meeting in the car upon the latter’s arrival, and then continue the discussion at Pasir Ris, when the remedy prescribed had been to simply interplead with Sports SG by official letter for their views, not even to craft a media release or embark in some other time-sensitive measure.

176    There were other odd details as well. Mr Tan claimed to have taken three days of vacation leave on 11 March 2013, 13 March 2013 and 15 March 2013. Mr Tan indicated that he had taken leave on 11 March 2013 and 13 March 2013 to handle the _tug of war_ seminar, which was the aforementioned event that had received coverage in the _Straits Times_, and rest in the aftermath of the event respectively. Mr Tan seemed rather tentative in responding on why he had taken leave on 15 March 2013[^188]:

>   
| 

Mr Tan

 | 

15th, I took VL, uh, to---to settle some shopping stuff, uh, for my family.

 |
| 

DPP

 | 

Okay. And were you shopping with anyone?

 |
| 

Mr Tan

 | 

No, no. Myself.

 |
| 

DPP

 | 

Okay. Because you say you were helping your wife to buy some…things. So, what was---where was your wife then?

 |
| 

Mr Tan

 | 

Oh. She was working.

 |

  
  

177    What was peculiar about this was that Mr Loh’s own account has his belief that “(Mr Terry Tan) _came down from_ **_his workplace_**_, to pick me up_”[^189], For completeness, before meeting Mr Loh, Mr Tan claimed to have spent that part of his vacation leave shopping at a mall, which he could not specifically recall, although he believed he had likely come from Tampines Mall. I found it strange therefore for Mr Loh to have called Mr Tan during a **_workday_**, with a confident expectation that Mr Tan would be able to meet him at Bishan Stadium from his usual workplace at Tanah Merah Besar, without even ascertaining if he had been working, doing shift duty, or on leave. Mr Tan’s work schedule was variable, and while he generally worked office hours, he would periodically have to cover shifts and would not have been able to come if he were working the p.m. shift, which extended to 9 p.m..[^190]

178    I agreed with the DPP’s analysis that Mr Tan’s only clear recall that day was the time he picked up Mr Loh, with other details of events in his day on 15 March 2013 recounted in a hazy and tentative manner. In my view, there would be little room to disagree with the learned DPP’s characterisation of Mr Terry Tan’s testimony that[^191]:

> …While lapses in recollection are understandable given the passage of time, for all the things he could not recall- and he could only give an estimate of all the timings of all the activities he normally would have done, he was unmistakable in providing the precise time when he met the Accused. **_Terry’s entire timings for the day were all backwards calculated and he could not remember any of the specific timings or what he did that day, except the precise time of his purported pick-up of Mr Loh…_**

> \[Emphasis added\]

### Alibi of claimed training of CHIJ (Toa Payoh) Athletes at Bishan Stadium in the afternoon of 15 March 2013

179    The Defence sought to show that rather than conducting the personal training session at **_Tampines_** Stadium in the afternoon of 15 March 2013, Mr Low had been in **_Bishan_** Stadium in the afternoon of 15 March 2013, conducting training for CHIJ Toa Payoh track students. For this aspect of the alibi case, the defence relied on the evidence of two witnesses, with the first being DW8, Ms Mylvaganam Jayalaxmi.

### Evidence of DW8, Ms Mylvaganam Jayalaxmi

180    Ms Mylvaganam Jayalaxmi (“Ms Jaya”) worked as a teacher aide cum teacher assistant at the material time at CHIJ Toa Payoh where she had worked from 2006 to 2015.She had known Mr Loh since 2006 as the coach for the school’s track and field team. As a teacher aide, Ms Jaya helped teachers in a classroom setting and invigilated for the special-needs students. More salient to this case, Ms Jaya trained the school track and field team and specialised in the long mid-distance and long-distance runs, which included cross country team events. Mr Loh’s specialty was on the distaff side, being principally engaged as a sprint coach. There were thus two coaches involved in two the two disparate running disciplines. Ms Jaya, who was the designated teacher-in-charge and coach of cross-country and distance runners was also assisted by another teacher: Mr Terrance Hou in her portfolio. This system of co-coaching system was extant in 2013.

### Training schedule

181    It was Ms Jaya’s evidence that CHIJ (Toa Payoh) held trainings thrice a week; on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays[^192]. Ms Jaya described Mr Loh as being very regular with his attendances, effusively stating that Mr Loh was “_very good_” and was “_there all the time_” unless he was otherwise indisposed by an overseas assignment. Within the period of mid Mach 2013, Ms Jaya stated that she and a group of CHIJ (Toa Payoh) students had participated in the SPH Schools Relay Championship 2013, held on the weekend of 16-17 March 2013, where Ms Jaya was a chief starter for the two-day meet which was held at Gombak Stadium. Mr. Loh had also been there as he had been a coach for CIJ (Toa Payoh) students, along with his role as a vice president of Singapore Athletic Association.

182    Ms Jaya indicated that despite the event on 16-17 March 2013, student athletes who were not competing in the events were expected to attend during the “normal training days” of Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and hence training would proceed as _per_ normal on 15 March 2013 for students unaffected by the sporting event.[^193] Ms Jeya went further to state that even a team of athletes competing in a baton relay on Sunday 17 March 2013 were expected to train on Friday 13 March 2013, to “_polish up_” their form.[^194]

183    On 15 March 2013, Ms Jaya asserted that the training had been conducted at Bishan Stadium and that Mr Loh had been there with her, to coach their respective teams of athletes. She recalled reaching Bishan Stadium before 3:30 pm and had seen Mr. Loh there. Ms Jaya had left earlier than she usually would at 5.35 pm as some of her athletes for the relay also had Saturday events, and she had thus ended training once she was satisfied that “_they are already familiarised how to run the race_.” [^195]

### DW8’s attendance records and school payment record both did not reflect any training on 15 March 2013

184    Ms Jaya stated that she maintained attendance records for her own set of trainees. These were maintained for what Ms Jaya stated to be for “_safety’s sake_’ which I took to mean a system of accountability to their young charges under the care and control of the respective coach. Ms Jaya underscored the importance of keeps close tabs for “_safety’s sake_” as experienced issues included the incidence of absent students claiming to have been training and causing parental consternation when they had called the school only to find that the child had been elsewhere. Accurate attendance taking was also essential as the trainees would occasionally sojourn away from school to an external environment such as Toa Payoh town precincts and MacRitchie reservoir, and coaches and teachers had to be answerable for injuries that might occur if the students sustained injuries while out. Precise attendance taking was also needed as the regularity of a student’s attendance to demonstrate their commitment of “_values in action_” (VIA) in performing their CCA duties.

185    Ms Jaya was shown two sets of records, the first was an attendance sheet which accompanied a payment schedule[^196], showing the training dates and payments made to Mr Loh for his role in training CHIJ (Toa Payoh) students.

186    Ms Jaya conformed that document had been a record compiled by another teacher (established as PW 9; Ms Paulin Theboral Solomon, who was subsequently called as rebuttal witness). While **_no_** training had been reflected in the payment schedule for **_15 March 2013_**, she noted that the accompanying attendance sheet seemed irregularly drafted and did not run in strict chronological order, with the column for 20 March 2013 being set out twice and a column for 11 March 2013 running after 22 March and before 27 March 2013. Her general view was that she was unfamiliar with the document stating “_I don’t know. This doesn’t involve me, because this is from the sprinter side._”[^197] This was a reference to the fact that the schedule had been prepared for the purpose of computing payment for Mr Loh an external party to CHIJ (Toa Payoh), and who had been specially engaged to train sprinters. She did nevertheless acknowledge that the attendance list of 52 students was a composite one which had included her 18 distance runner students.

187    Ms Jaya was then shown a handwritten set of records rendered in penmanship which struck me as meticulously neat style, which she confirmed to be attendance records[^198] she had created. The form set out the attendance of 18 student athletes enrolled in the distance running CCA for CHIJ (Toa Payoh) for the month of March 2013. The following is a reconstruction of the salient part of the form with the row indicating the dates where attendance for the students had been marked, as well as other relevant annotations. The names of the students and actual attendance markings are excluded, as these are not relevant details for the present proceedings.

> Annotation: _18-22/3 X-ctry Centralised Training Camp_

### Comparing and reconciling the two sets of records

188    What was striking was that an examination of Ms Jaya’s own records and the other set of attendance and payment documentation did **_not_** show records of any track training on 15 March 2013. This was despite Ms Jaya’s staunch maintenance that she had trained with Mr Loh that day. I should add that there are differences between the two sets of records, but these reconcilable, and primarily attributable to the distance athletes following a slightly different programme from their sprint sisters.

189    Ms Jaya’s records had **_four_** additional dates being 1 March 2013, 11 March 2013, 18 March 2013, and 19 March 2013. Ms Jaya had confirmed that 1 March 2013 concerned only her cross-country and distance event athletes, and her athletes had to attend to a special centralised camp from 18-22 March 2013. Other notable differences were that 11 March was reflected in **_both_** attendance lists but not reflected in the payment schedule, and that the cross country team, according to Ms Jaya’s record, trained on two **_Thursdays_** (7 March 2013, 14 March 2013), while the former exhibit[^199] showed track trainings on two **_Tuesdays_** (5 March 2013 and 12 March 2013) which were not reflected in her exhibit. The fact that Ms Jaya put two “_Thu_” annotations above the entries for 7 March 2013 and 14 March 2013 suggested that these were extraordinary substitutional schedulings from the general track and field group which had conducted their training on Tuesday, as against Ms Jaya’s distance runners training on Thursday. PW 10; Mr Daryl Chan, would later testify that the formal training dates for the track and field CCA group were actually Monday, **_Tuesday_** and Wednesday in that the first quarter of 2013, and that Friday was not a formal training day[^200].

### Assertion of “extra-training sessions” being held by DW 8 and the accused over and above the formally recorded sessions

190    At the tail end of her cross-examination, DPP Gail Wong suggested to Ms Jaya that an examination of Ms Jaya’s own record showed “_no scheduled school training for 15 March 2013 went on_”.[^201]

>   
| 

DPP

 | 

**_I suggest to you that no scheduled school training for 15th of March 2013 went on. You can agree or disagree._**

 |
| 

Ms Jaya

 | 

**_I don’t know, I didn’t see the schedule, so I wouldn’t know whether_** it’s a sched---**_schedule for 15th of March_**.

 |
| 

DPP:

 | 

And all you can tell the Court today is based on the records and not your own memory. Do you…agree or disagree?

 |
| 

Ms Jaya

 | 

Uh, my record is helping me to recall.

 |
| 

DPP:

 | 

**_So, your position is that your record will be complete, correct?_**

 |
| 

Ms Jaya

 | 

**_Correct._**

 |
| 

\[Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

191    There thus appeared to be a cautiously couched concession on Ms Jaya’s part that was framed on two premises. The **_first_** premise was that she **_relied_** on her records to recall whether training had taken place. The **_second_** premise was her conviction that her records of official trainings was **_complete_**_. Ergo_, if she had not recorded any training for 15 March 2013, then there had been **_no_** official training that day. She conceded that “_only going based on recollection_” there “_could be parents-teachers meeting_” on 15 March 2013 and that was “_why maybe I had training on the 14th_.”[^202]

192    At re-examination by counsel however, Ms Jaya shifted her stance to posit that an _impromptu_ and unrecorded training session had been held on 15 March 2013, and that this had been for the benefit of a promising new athlete named “_Alex_” to perfect her baton passing technique. Ms Jaya began this pivot by claiming that there was a degree of flexibility and discretion on training dates. The school was, she claimed, generally amenable to rescheduling a session originally scheduled on Friday to another day. Ms Jaya cited, as an example, her holding a training session the week before, on **_Thursday_** 8 March 2013, because her athletes would be involved in the _Venus Run_ on **_Saturday_** 10 March 2013 (an event which Ms Jaya claimed to have attended), and thus needed a reprieve from the “formal training session” that she asserted to have been originally scheduled (_per_ Exhibit D33) on **_Friday_** 9 March 2013.

193    For the next week, which would encompass the critical date of 15 March 2013, Ms Jaya then _segued_ to there being **_both_** a **_formal_** training session on **_Thursday_** 14 March 2013 (which she had duly recorded in Exhibit P33), **_and_** a subsequent **_informal_** session of **_light training_** on Friday 15 March 2013, which was not recorded and involved Mr Loh, her and an elite cadre of girls who had been earmarked for the relay races. Given the significance of this point, it is apposite to reproduce Ms Jaya’s testimony on this[^203]:

> Because 16th of March is the SPH relay…Those who are competing, like I said earlier on---those who are competing on 16th will not train on the 15th, right? Di---need to rest and like what you said and what I earlier said. **_But there was training on the 15th of March, like I said, I explained earlier on of the---the need to, for the 4 by 400, for the girls to know how to run the race. So technically, okay, you can say it’s light training_**, lah.

> \[Emphasis added\]

### DW8’s attempt to explain omission of the session on 15 March 2013 in her records

194    Ms Jaya made a considerable effort to justify her **_non-inclusion_** of Friday 15 March 2013 in her training records to state that she had deliberately brought forward the formal training date from Friday to Thursday. This explanation would be contradicted by the subsequent evidence of a rebuttal witness who would testify that **_Fridays_** were **_not_** scheduled training days for the entire first quarter of 2013, despite this being indicated to be so in the training schedule[^204]. Ms Jaya then sought to explain that despite training on Thursday, an additional session on Friday was deemed necessary to familiarise ‘_Alex_’ and prepare her for the SPH Relay event on 16 March 2013. Ms Jaya, a witness who had earlier been vehement about her inerrant recall of events, was curiously tentative and uncertain in stating “_it_ **_must have_** _been a last minute_” and that “_Mr. Loh_ **_must have_** _insisted and_(sic) _all those things._” The frenetic, disjointed and rambling manner that Ms Jaya spoke gave me a niggling sense that she was making up her account as she went along.[^205] Ms Jaya states:

> And I would like to add, yes, you may---okay, now I’m going to---you’re saying why, how come I don’t have it marked here. I would like to say---I’m not going to use any other words, 14 (_March 2013_), I replaced it, because 15 (_March 2013_), you’re supposed to rest, right? Because 16 (_March 2013_), we have competition, so 14 (_March 2013_, yes, all the girls come, because we have a track. Um, all come and train and mark attendance. But 15 (_March 2013}_, we had training because of ‘Alex’. **_So I don’t have to put it here. I’ve already accounted for it._** So what I can recall it---**_it must have been a last minute, better come and prepare_**, ‘Alex’, come on, better go, **_Mr. Loh must have insisted and all those things. Come. We go to Bishan._** So I had to go, because it’s---‘Alex’ is there. And I got a few girls to go and run with, to come, whoever is free, you come. Just like that…

195    Ms Jaya’s not marking 15 March 2013 in her training records, on her ostensible reason of her having substituted the training with the session on 14 March 2013, is difficult to accept on two different levels. The first, as explained above, is that 15 March 2013 was **_not_** an **_official_** training day and hence no substitution or replacement was necessary. The second is that Ms Jaya never had any compunction in recording **_consecutive_** trainings in her records, for which no fewer than six instances appear among her 14 entries for March 2013:

> (a)     6 -7 March 2013 (Wednesday-Thursday)

> (b)     13-14 March 2013 (Wednesday-Thursday)

> (c)     18-19 March 2013 (Monday-Tuesday)

> (d)     19-20 March 2013 (Tuesday-Wednesday)

> (e)     20-21 March 2013 (Wednesday-Thursday)

> (f)     21-22 March 2013 (Thursday-Friday)

### Evidence of DW9; Amirah Aljunied

196    At the time of trial, Ms Amirah Aljunied (“Ms Amirah”) was a second-year student at the Singapore Management University (SMU) at its Accountancy faculty. She had trained with Mr Low from her days in CHIJ (Toa Payoh) to the end of her stint at Raffles Junior College. He had thus been her track coach from 2012 to 2017. Ms Amirah recalled her days for her formal training to be Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 3:30pm to 6:30 pm. Ms Amirah asserted that the training days were “_the same for the 4 years_ (she) _was in school._”[^206] Ms Amirah was asked the same question at cross-examination by the learned DPP and repeated with the same certitude[^207]:

>   
| 

DPP:

 | 

Now you testified earlier that the school training was Monday, Wednesday, Friday---

 |
| 

Ms Aljunied:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

DPP:

 | 

during the period when you were in IJ Toa Payoh.

 |
| 

Ms Aljunied:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

DPP:

 | 

**_Was there any term_**\---if you can think carefully, was there any term, just for that term, **_when it was Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday?_**

 |
| 

Ms Aljunied:

 | 

**_No I’m pretty sure_** ever since I entered secondary school from sec 1 to sec 4, **_it has always been Monday, Wednesday and Friday._**

 |
| 

\[Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

197    The reason for my emphasis on Ms Amirah’s recollection on the official training days for CHIJ (Toa Payoh) track and field athletes is because her recall was found to be demonstrably wrong in this detail by the subsequent evidence of a rebuttal witness. The excerpt above would show that the DPP had asked her to _“think carefully_” with a suggestion of the correct answer of Monday, **_Tuesday_** and Wednesday which was extant during the material time. I was thus satisfied that the DPP had given Ms Amirah all opportunity to give a considered response in this aspect of the case.

198    Ms Amirah purported to vividly recall the SPH Schools Relay Championship 2013 at Bukit Gombak Stadium. She had taken part in the event since she had been Secondary one. In 2013, she had run “_all the races_” which she took to mean that she had run four events which encompassed both sprint and distance events. Specifically, she had run the 4 by 100 metre, the 4 by 200 metre, 4 by 400 metre, and 4 by 800 metre relays for her division.

199    Ms Amirah had recalled her events occurring on Saturday and Sunday, 16 March 2013 and 17 March 2013. She also recalled that “_light training_” had been done “_just to practice our baton passing_”[^208] the day before; 15 March 2013, at Bishan Stadium. She indicated that her teammates and Mr. Loh had been involved in this light training. Ms Amirah did not recall the full names of her team-mates. Using their commonly used names, the witness recalled the line-up to comprise[^209] :

> (a)     Four by 100 metre relay: Ms Amirah, “_Pebbles_”, “_Kai Ching_” and ‘_Andriana_’.

> (b)     Four by 200 metre relay: Ms Amirah, “_Andriana_”, “_Kai Ching_” and “_Jade_”

> (c)     Four by 400 metre relay: Ms Amirah “_Pebbles_”, “_Alex_” and “_Jade_”

> (d)     Four by 800 metre relay: Ms Amirah “_Pebbles_”, “_Alex_” and “_Laticia_”.

200    From P27, the names that would bear the closest match to the names supplied by Ms Amirah would be (in order of reference by DW 9):

>   
| 

(i)

 | 

“_Pebbles_”:

### DW9’s recall of the race line-up differed from the official record.

201    The prosecution challenged Ms Amirah’s recall as the records appeared to show that the four by 200 metre team featured Ms Amirah, ‘_Jade_’, “_Pebbles_” and ‘_Andriana’_, not “_Kai Ching_”. Ms Amirah however stood her ground as her impression was that _“Pebbles_” did not run that event. She opined that “_Andriana_” was the best sprinter and would have been chosen in any event. Of the other two girls, she asserted that “(b)_ased on my memory I believe it was “Andriana” and “Kai Ching”, instead of “Pebbles” and “Andriana_””. She however later conceded that the official record which had the names submitted by the school, ought to be correct. The DPP had also challenged her on the four by 800 metre even where track records showed the team to comprise “_Laticia_”, “_Alex_”, Ms Amirah and a “_Charlotte Leong_”. When asked if she accepted that her “_memory could be mistaken_”, Ms Amirah persisted in her view that she was “_I’m pretty sure Pebbles ran this race with_ (the 800-metre team)”[^210] . I should note that Ms Jaya also differed from Ms Amirah in this regard, as she distinctly recalled that “_Charlotte Leong_” (whose full name was ‘Leong Su Min Charlotte’),[^211] had also taken part in the 800-metre relay, where the team had come in third[^212].

202    I would observe therefore that while Ms Amirah was able to give her evidence in a poised and confident manner, her **_actual_** recall of events was somewhat less than eidetic. Essentially, in a bid to recall the constituent relay quartet of the four races she herself ran in on the weekend of 16-17 March 2013, Ms Amirah effectively attained a **_50 % success rate_** of recall, despite the pool of potential choices being limited to a handful of elite female athletes from CHIJ (Toa Payoh).

203    Rather incongruously, from the tenor of her answers, Ms Amirah appeared to have substituted what should have been an attempt at factual recall of who was **_actually_** in a race, reconstructing where her memory failed, with her own reasoning of who **_should_** have run a particular event, based on her subjective assessment of their athletic skills, and answering from this extrapolation. Hence, while Ms Amirah’s account of undertaking an extra training session in the afternoon of 15 March 2013 to train up newcomer “_Alex_” seems, on the surface, compelling, this narrative must be weighed in the context of Ms Amirah being somehow oblivious to the presence and contribution of teammates; Ms Pebbles Lee Wern and Ms Charlotte Leong, in two events that the witness herself ran.

### DW9’s account of training activities on Friday 15 March 2013

204    The witness recalled that the workout had been “_very light training_” where the athletes had merely practiced baton passing and were conscious not to exert themselves given the impending race that weekend. She recalled that the session had begun with a warm-up 3:30 pm. After a 30-minute warm up, the runners in attendance would start at 4:00pm with the four by 100 metre relay with an emphasis on baton passing. This was the most energy intensive event and would last for 30 to 45 minutes. The athletes would then move on to the baton passing drills for the four by 400 metre baton passing, which was much faster process taking just 15 to 30 minutes. She thus concluded that the practice would be over at “_about 5 to 5:30 pm_”[^213] and extend to just about 1½ hours to 2 hours, as opposed to the usual training sessions which could extend to three hours. She had recalled the event as this was part of a bittersweet memory where her four by 100-meter relay team had subsequently beaten the senior team but the team later been disqualified during the heats rounds.

### Difference in time between end of training at Bishan Stadium according to DW9 and the time DW7 met the accused outside the Stadium

205    Ms Amirah’s recollection that the training in Bishan Stadium had been from 3:30 to “_around_ 5:30” pm and thus differs from DW 7; Mr Terry Tan’s evidence to have been asked to wait till past 6.00 pm. Mr Terry Tan seems to have indexed his testimony on CHIJ (Toa Payoh)’s **_official_** training timing of 3.30 pm to 6.00pm. Other than Mr. Loh and her follow relay competitors, Ms Amirah indicated that the cross-country team had also been training at the same area, and hence their coach Mrs. Jaya had been there. To recapitulate, Ms Jaya also recalls leaving Bishan Stadium at about 5.35 pm.

### Critique of entries in track and field attendance sheet

206    Ms Amirah had criticised the haphazard nature of the entries in P27(i) (later P27), asserting that there ought not have been “_consecutive days of formal training_”.[^214] She wondered if the erratic markings had been because of the fact that different teachers would be involved in marking the attendance records. She accepted that the teacher-in-charge Mr Daryl Chan knew the student athletes well, but that Ms Paulin Theboral did not. Ms Paulin also did not know the girls well and was known to delegate the team captain or the vice-captain who was present at training and take attendance from their representations. Essentially, Ms Amirah did not believe the attendance records in (then) Exhibit P27(i) to be accurate on the following bases[^215]:

> Because formal trainings have always been Monday, Wednesday, Friday and I don’t know what days corresponds to these dates, but I know that it’s never consecutive and we don’t have double trainings either and, um, 11th of March comes after 12th, 13th, 20th and 22nd, so it doesn’t really make sense.

### DW9’s training relationship with accused

207    At cross examination, Ms Amirah stated that she would be involved in not just the thrice-weekly formal training sessions organised by CHIJ (Toa Payoh) but also “side trainings” organised by Mr Loh on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Ms Amirah did not dispute the learned DPPs computation that she might have attended “_easily more than 900 over sessions over a period of 5 to 6 years_”.[^216] She had rarely missed any trainings from Secondary one to her second year of Junior College and would attend “_almost 6 sessions a week_”. The witness acknowledged that Mr Loh had been her grandfather’s friend, and she considered herself close to Mr Loh, aside from her training with him. She would make it a practice to personally deliver chocolate cake to his residence every Chinese New Year.

## EVIDENCE OF REBUTTAL WITNESSES

### Evidence of PW 10 Daryl Chan Chiang

208    PW10, Mr Daryl Chan was called by the prosecution to rebut certain aspects of Ms Jaya’s and Ms Amirah’s testimonies, principally their contention that a training session had been held on Friday 15 March 2013. Mr Chan had been teaching at CHIJ Toa Payoh since 2008 where he remained as a PE teacher. He had been in charge of track and field since 2009, and identified Ms Paulin was one of the teachers handling the activity in 2013. Mr Chan was also familiar with Ms Jaya whom, he recalled, had been employed as a relief teacher during school hours but assumed coaching duties during official school training sessions. Mr Chan indicated that teachers were responsible for the safety of the enrolled students and would communicate with the coaches whether there are any irregularities in terms of safety, and also take attendance for the students present. Mr Chan was able to confirm that he had filled in portions of the payment form for Mr Loh. He had filled in the fields for “_pay to_”, _date of invoice_” of 20 April 2013 as well as the date and duration of the programme or activity.[^217] Turning to the attendance sheet, Mr Chan stated that he had filled in some of the entries, recalling his own handwriting when he made an annotation about a student who was on medical leave.

209    At Page 3 of P27, Mr Chan noted Mr Loh’s signature at the field designated for the signature of the coach. The purpose of the signature was to “_verify that those were the dates that training occurred as well as the amount payable to him_.”[^218] The dates where the training events had been conducted were assiduously conducted even if the coaches received a flat rate of $1500 per month irrespective of the number of sessions they conducted, because accurate records were required for input to the school’s Ministry of Education-linked computer system to enable a certification that a student had fulfilled a minimum 75% attendance for her CCA.

### PW10’s explanation why there would have been no formal school training on 15 March 2013

210    It was Mr Chan’s evidence that 15 March 2013 would have been an unsuitable date for training as the day had been designated for parent-teacher meetings to be held, and also that CHIJ (Toa Payoh) would be observing World _Water Day_ the very next day, along with the fact that SPH relay was concurrently scheduled for 16 March 2013. Although Mr Chan had no direct recollection of the day itself, he stated that he would have been indisposed for training as he was a form teacher and would have been expected to perform specific duties that day.

### PW10 explanation for discrepancies with CHIJ (Toa Payoh’s) training and competition schedule

211    Mr Chan’s evidence was challenged by the defence team’s production of a Track and Field Training and Competition Schedule Term 1 and 2 2013[^219], which had previously been admitted through Mr Loh, as recipient of a copy of the document. The schedule listed trainings on Mondays, Wednesdays and **_Fridays ostensibly_** for the first half of 2013. The abrupt production of this schedule midstream the defence case had been the impetus for the prosecution to call for an opportunity to present rebuttal witness. Mr Chan had examined the schedule and indicated that there had been material changes made to the Track and Field Training and Competition Schedule which were not reflected in the exhibit.

212    In addressing the material period, which was the first quarter of 2013, Mr Chan stated that while track training had been **_generally_** conducted on Mondays, Wednesdays and **_Fridays_**, there had been a time when the thrice-weekly training schedule had been modified to Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Looking at CHIJ (Toa Payoh)’s **_actual_** training records, Mr Chan stated that the first quarter of 2013, (encompassing 15 March 2013) had been the period. For the entries in D33, while the original form had been pre-filled earlier to include **_Fridays_**, Mr Chan indicated that the records showed **_actual_** trainings having been held on the following dates in the first quarter of 2013 (the list excludes **_Tuesdays_** as the day was never pre-filled in the original Track and Field Training and Competition Schedule for weekday training sessions):

> (i)     7 January 2013 (Monday) 3.30pm -6.00 pm at CHIJ Secondary\*

> (ii)     8 January 2013 (Wednesday) 3.30pm-6.00 pm CHIJ Secondary

> (iii)     14 January 2013 (Monday) 3.30pm -6.00 pm CHIJ Secondary

> (iv)     16 January 2013 (Wednesday) 3.30pm-6.00 pm CHIJ Secondary

> (v)     21 January 2013 (Monday) 3.30pm -6.00 pm CHIJ Secondary

> (vi)     23 January 2013 (Wednesday) 3.30pm -6.00 pm CHIJ Secondary

> (vii)     28 January 2013 (Monday) 3.30pm -6.00 pm CHIJ Secondary

> (viii)    30 January 2013 (Wednesday) 3.30pm -6.00 pm CHIJ Secondary

> (ix)     4 February 2013 (Monday) 3.30pm -6.00 pm CHIJ Secondary

> (x)     6 February 2013 (Wednesday) 3.30pm -6.00 pm CHIJ Secondary

> (xi)     13 February 2013 (Wednesday) 3.30pm -6.00 pm CHIJ Secondary

> (xii)     18 February 2013 (Monday) 3.30pm -6.00 pm CHIJ Secondary

> (xiii)    20 February 2013 (Wednesday) 3.30pm -6.00 pm CHIJ Secondary

> (xiv)     25 February 2013 (Monday) 3.30pm -6.00 pm CHIJ Secondary

> (xv)     27 February 2013 (Wednesday) 3.30pm -6.00 pm CHIJ Secondary

> (xvi)     4 March 2013 (Monday) 3.30pm -6.00 pm Toa Payoh Stadium/Bishan Stadium

> (xvii)    6 March 2013 (Wednesday) 3.30pm -6.00 pm Toa Payoh Stadium/Bishan Stadium

> (xviii)    13 March 2013 (Wednesday) 3.30pm -6.00 pm Toa Payoh Stadium/Bishan Stadium

> (xix)     20 March 2013 (Wednesday) 3.30pm -6.00 pm Toa Payoh Stadium/Bishan Stadium/CHIJ Secondary

> (xx)     22 March 2013 (Friday) 3.30pm -6.00 pm Toa Payoh Stadium/Bishan Stadium/CHIJ Secondary

> (xxi)     27 March 2013 (Wednesday) 3.30pm -6.00 pm Toa Payoh Stadium/Bishan Stadium.

>> (\*_denotes the running track within the premises of CHIJ (Toa Payoh) Secondary School_)

213    It was therefore the case that while the original Track and Field Training and Competition Schedule as drafted had scheduled trainings on 1 March 2013, 8 March 2013, 15 March 2013 and 22 March 2013, the **_only_** actual training session for the full track team for a Friday in March had been 22 March 2013. Ms Jaya had of course stated that she had arranged to train her distance runners separately on 1 March 2013.

### PW 10’s evidence on “official” and “unofficial” training sessions conducted by the accused

214    At cross-examination, Mr Chan clarified that P27 was intended to record student attendance at discrete training events and not if they had participated in competitions. Mr Loh himself was also not required to fill in any attendance sheet, as the records were intended to be to keep a tab on students’ attendances[^220]. Mr Chan conceded that elite athletes like Ms Amirah Aljunied might need more than thrice a week training, and could not exclude her participating in “_unofficial_” training sessions with Mr Loh outside of the formal school sessions arranged for CHIJ (Toa Payoh) athletes [^221], which Ms Amirah, of course, claims to have done on a weekly scale.

215    As an aside here, if counsel was pivoting to suggest that Ms Amirah had attended an unofficial or informal training event with the accused on 15 March 2013, I should note that it was Mr Loh’s evidence that he was attending to an **_official_** CHIJ (Toa Payoh) training session on Friday 13 March 2013. Mr Loh’s response, especially his referring to the SPH Relay on 16-17 March 2013, makes his response to counsel’s questions at re-examination especially unequivocal[^222]:

>   
| 

Mr Loh:

 | 

**_My regular training is Monday, Wednesday, Friday._** I have to attend the 2 important competition, SPH relay on the 16, 17. And also I have to attend the 2nd and 3rd of March in Choa Chu Kang. It’s junior a championship, 2nd and 3rd.

### Evidence of PW9 Paulin Theboral Solomon

216    I have transposed the evidence of the two rebuttal witnesses, as it would be easier to understand PW 9 Ms Paulin Theboral Solomon’s (Ms Paulin) evidence after gaining a level of familiarity of processes put in place for track athletes at CHIJ (Toa Payoh) through Mr Daryl Chan’s testimony. Ms Paulin worked for a relatively brief period in the school, having joined in September 2012 and left in December 2015. Ms Paulin was a form teacher who also taught Tamil and was involved as a CCA teacher in track and field activities. Her duties included taking attendance and facilitating the issuance of sports equipment for track and field training. Ms Paulin’s evidence was principally relevant in relation to her direct interactions with athletes during their sessions, and how she had input and processed the attendance records.

217    Ms Paulin stated that she would be present for each training session which were notionally indicated with a start time of 3:30pm and an end time of 6:00pm. Mr Loh might come early, allowing the training to start at around 2:30 to 2:45. Ms Paulin stated that she would ordinarily be there during the entire duration of the training session, pausing for toilet breaks or if she had to attend to work at the staff room.

218    For the taking of attendance, the witness explained that she was new to the school and had not developed an ability to recognise all the athletes. She would accordingly enlist the help of team captains; Ms Amirah and Ms Pebbles, to identify students. Ms Paulin also conceded that she could not speak English very well, and this added another barrier to her effective communication with the students, noting that only Ms Amirah and Ms Pebbles would “_talk to_ (her) _a little more_” and she relied on them to assist and update her. The witness emphasized that she nevertheless was the one who appended the markings denoting that the identified student was present stating “(a_)fter the students tell me, I will mark the attendance sheet. They will point out the students and tell me who are the students and then I will mark_ …_the attendance_.” .[^223] Ms Paulin was clear too that she was concerned with the 34 track and field athletes who ran shorter distances, leaving Ms Jaya to fill in the form for her 18 distance athletes. In this regard, the form was partitioned after serial number 34 and numbers 35 to 52 were Ms Jaya’s concern. Ms Paulin explained that the cryptic annotation “_Jaya mad_” at that section was meant as a prompt for users that that was “_Mdm Jaya’s_” portion. The attendance markings were made by the teacher-in-charge on the day. I noted that Ms Paulin’s style was to use a tick, while another teacher seemed to prefer to use “I” bar to denote that a student was present. Ms Paulin indicated that she had filled the attendance sheet for training sessions on 4 March 2013, 6 March 2013, 13 March 2013, the apparent double entries on 20 March 2013, 22 March 2013 and 27 March 2013.[^224] Ms Paulin identified Mr Daryl Chan as the other teacher who had marked the attendance sheet. [^225]

219    The _raison d’être_ of Ms Paulin’s recall by the prosecution was for the purpose of her testimony on the attendance records at the last page o P27(i), where Ms Paulin identified herself as the main author of the document. (The document was re-marked P27 after Mr Chan confirmed his role in the preceding documents (i.e. the payment forms) in the exhibit). Ms Paulin did confirm that there had been no record of any training event on 15 March 2013[^226].

### Addressing the issue of the “double” entry of “20/3” denoting 20 March 2013 in the attendance form

220    The attendance sheet at P27 was not without its own set of anomalies. There was a degree of dys-synchronicity in the fact that the markings for 11 March 2013 came in as one of the final entries in the series, after 22 March 2013. The biggest enigma was that there appeared to be **_two_** sets of entries for 20/3, denoting 20 March 2013. The discordant series of dates is as depicted below:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="9.26370548219288%"> <col width="9.26370548219288%"> <col width="7.40296118447379%"> <col width="7.40296118447379%"> <col width="7.40296118447379%"> <col width="9.26370548219288%"> <col width="9.2436974789916%"> <col width="9.26370548219288%"> <col width="9.26370548219288%"> <col width="5.56222488995598%"> <col width="9.26370548219288%"> <col width="7.40296118447379%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Name</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Class</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4/3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5/3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6/3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">12/3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">13/3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>20/3</b></p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">20/3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">22/3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">11/3</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">27/3</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

221    Neither Ms Paulin nor Mr Daryl could recall the reason for the anomalies. The only conceivable reason for the transposition of the entries for 11 March 2013 to come after the three sets of entries for 20 March 2013 (double) and 22 March 2013 would be because the entries for 11 March 2020 were posted after the fact, likely on or after 22 March 2013. This does not have any significant bearing since 11 March 2013 was a full **_four_** days **_before_** the date of interest, which was of course 15 March 2013.

222    The double entry would deserve considerably more scrutiny particularly since the actual attendance marking in the separate rows of “20/3” seem to differ, with there being distinctly fewer tick markings (denoting an athlete as present) on the right row than on the left row. Thus, the markings, if accurate, would denote **_two separate_** training days. I did note that first “20” of the two “20/3” figures did in fact appear to be **_overwritten_**. Ms Paulin had recalled marking the attendance of the athletes but could not recall who had overwritten the numeral characters “20/3” from its original marking. Ms Paulin was also unaware of what that original date marking had been. This was seized upon by the defence which sought to draw an implication that the number had overwritten had been a “15” and there had thus been a record of attendance for 15 March 2013 after all, albeit that this had been concealed as the first of the entries of 20 March 2013, and somehow overwritten by the “20”.[^227]

### The original number which was overwritten is not “15” but “19”

223    A close inspection under magnification of the overwritten “20” however, does not bear this out. It is apparent that the first digit is actually a “1” and overwritten to form a “2”, with the previous form of the “1” barely discernible as a single vertical stroke, with the remnant of the line extruding at the lower right side of the character “2”. For the second digit which is an overwritten “O”, I would note that there is no suggestion of a top horizontal bar that would suggest a “5”. Instead, there is a gentler recurve at the top of the character, forming an elliptical shape at the middle of the zero, followed by an obvious vertical line which extruded quite prominently beyond the circumscription of the “O” at its lower part. I was thus convinced that this was a “**9**” and the original characters had been “**_19/3_**” denoting **_19 March_** 2013.

![]([2021] SGMC 0016_Image/[2021] SGMC 0016_image1.png)

### The list of students listed as present on the first “20/3” column exceeded the number of athletes competing in the quartet baton relay events

224    In any event, the defence’s case that the column recorded a list of trainees for a training event on 15 March 2013 would be at odds with Ms Amirah and Ms Jaya’s account that the training that afternoon was meant to merely hone the baton passing skills of **_five sprinters_** (Ms Amirah Aljunied, Ms Pebbles Lee Wern, Ms Wang Kai Qing, Ms Andreana Tang Wei and Ms Jayde Ashley Yeung) with two (according to Ms Amirah) or **_three_** (according to Ms Jaya) **_long distance runners_** (Ms Alexandra Louise Wee Rei-Min (“Alex”), Ms Lettitia Jules Quek, and according to Ms Jaya; Ms Samantha Leong). This is because the list of attendees who were marked present at that date included **_another 11 female athletes_**.

### Could DW9’s recollection be a false memory?

226    While I accept that Ms Amirah might have a vivid memory of training on Friday 15 March 2013, and where she had trained with “Alex”, who was new to the baton relay, I wondered if this might be a false memory from an amalgam of past recollected events given that she had attended 900 sessions over her six years with Mr Loh and he had become a dominant, almost daily presence in her life during her athletic career. This being especially where the documents and testimonies tendered in the prosecution’s rebuttal evidence would show the light baton practice episode in Bishan Stadium never occurred.

### Analysis of alibi evidence for 15 March 2013

227    It is important to bear in mind that the burden is on the defence to establish an alibi on a balance of probabilities. In this regard, the defence had to contend with not just the oral testimony of Ms C, but also a _WhatsApp_ message chain[^228] where Mr Toh Wee Hong had in the late morning of 15 March 2013 inquired about whether group training among the private trainees was to be conducted in Bishan. After four hours, Ms C had messaged “**_Tampines!_**” at 1.53pm, thus bolstering the prosecution’s case of the venue of the training event. The chain also shows how a prospective inquiry for a group training event was whittled away to just one attendee; Ms C herself, with the other trainees being told to take a respite from training that day, thus setting the scene for what would be an individual session between Mr Loh and Ms C.

228    The message between Mr Loh and Mr Tan Tze Jung, dated 15 March 2013[^229], would prove to be a veritable double-edged sword. Mr Loh had sought to use his response at 11.07 am that day, that he had a “_meeting_” as ostensible proof of his meeting at Bishan Stadium carpark with Mr Terry Tan, even if the message essentially said nothing of who he would meet and the agenda of this conference. In my view, the more important aspect of the message chain must be Mr Tan’s query _“Can I check with you_ **_whether there is training today_**_?”_ Mr Loh’s deflection to “_take a break today_” implies either that there was **_no group training_** that day or that he was simply **_not keen_** to train Mr Tan that day.

229    The first possibility is inconsistent with the defence case that Mr Loh **_was_** in fact engaged in training in Bishan Stadium in the afternoon to early evening of 15 March 2013. The second possibility also raises doubt and begs the question why Mr Loh could not accommodate Mr Tan Tze Jung’s desire to train, since it was the practice for private trainees to train in tandem with school athletes at the same venue, even though they might come into the venue slightly **_later_**. Ms C had stated in her evidence that she trained at CHIJ (Toa Payoh) and Catholic Junior College, along with venues in public stadia, such as Tampines Stadium and Bishan Stadium, when she was a private trainee, with her sessions starting at about 5.00 pm and ending at 7.00 pm on weekdays as she was on an industrial internship and her company has allowed her to leave for training at 4.00 or 4.30pm each day. Other athletes started at different times, with Ms W recalling beginning her sessions between 4.00pm and 5.00pm.

230    Ultimately the prosecution’s exhibited test message showed a **_place_** and a **_time_**, which were **_Tampines_** Stadium, in the **_afternoon_** of 15 March 2013, while the defence’s text exhibit contained a bare reference to a “_meeting_” where the agenda, time and venue of the same had not been specified. Given that this was Mr Loh’s own response to Mr Tan to tell him to take a break, there was no proof (other than Mr Terry Tan’s court testimony, which was uncorroborated by any **_direct_** evidence) that the event was ever held. The newspaper reportage over the tug-of-war controversy would at best be circumstantial **_indirect_** evidence to found the possibility that a meeting **_might_** have been held among office holders of the Singapore Athletic Association to resolve the _imbroglio_ during the proximate period. Essentially, the messages simply established that Mr Tan Tze Jung had been dissuaded by Mr Loh from undergoing group training on 15 March 2013, despite his evident interest displayed by posing the query in the first place.

231    In relation to the claimed meeting, I found Mr Terry Tan’s account lacking in credibility. For the alibi, Mr Tan claimed to be the counterparty of an arrangement to meet Mr Loh at Bishan Stadium. This was even though both Mr Loh and he lived in the **_East_**, in Pasir Ris and Tanah Merah respectively. The impetus for arranging such an urgent meeting seemed dubious, as the meeting had simply resolved for the Singapore Athletic Association to write formally for Sports SG’s views on handling the competing tug-of-war federations.

232    The time of the meeting also became an area of contention as differences emerged between Mr Loh’s characterisation of the type of training and that of his alibi witnesses. As alluded to above, Mr Loh had claimed to have a normal training session with a full- complement of the track and field trainees. Both Ms Jaya and Ms Amirah had stated that only a light session to ‘_prep_’ competitors on the finer points of baton passing had been undertaken while Mr Loh was allegedly in Bishan Stadium on 15 March 2013. Their evidence was that the training would have ceased by about 5.30 pm. This of course did not quite ‘_jell_’ with Mr Terry Tan’s evidence that Mr Loh had deferred meeting with him until past 6.00 pm.

233    Aside from the mismatch in time, there was presented incongruity of Mr Tan; a busy person who aside from his Singapore Athletic Association office handled important duties as a public officer, undertaking a circuitous journey to Bishan Stadium to attend a **_two-person_** meeting on matters which could have been dealt with by phone or text, and then being made to **_wait_** till past 6.00, where the other alibi witnesses had said that training had finished a half hour earlier.

### The accused signed a payment form which did not reflect any attendance on his part on 15 March 2013

234    From the foregoing, Ms Paulin and Mr Chan have produced payment and attendance records showing that there had been no records of attendance or training occurring on 15 March 2013. While the defence has faulted the attendance record[^230], which I myself found the attendance sheet at Exhibit P27-to be somewhat untidy and haphazard (given that it was filled by different teachers and there had been at least on instance; on 11 March 2013, where the entries had not been contemporaneously input), it is telling that the payment form listing the dates of training services (Exhibit P27-2) provided by Mr Loh for 10 training sessions in the month of March 2013 did **_not_** include 15 March 2013.

235    Defence counsel had sought to clarify[^231] in their written submissions that “_The Accused explained that he did not read the contents of the Claim Form, which was given to him when he was conducting training by one of the teacher-in charge, PW9. So he just signed both at the box for teacher in charge and coach’_. I would note that the two signature boxes provided in the ‘Part Time Coach Instructor Claim Form’ are situated just several lines below the clearly listed training dates for the box. Mr Low of course acknowledged that the signatures were his, and they were, in any case, similar to the signature in his police statement (Exhibit P25).

236    In my _extempore_ grounds, I had stated that Mr Loh might be short paid if an attendance was not reflected. This is incorrect, as Mr Loh was paid a fixed sum of $1500 per month irrespective of the number of times the training sessions were held. Still, it seems surprising that Mr Loh could sign without inspecting the entries, given that his long career in the Prisons Service and the high office he held at the Singapore Athletic Association would not have disposed him to be a person prone to blindly appending his signature to any document.

### Verdict on alibi on 15 March 2013

237    Given the evidence set out above, I was satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that Mr Loh did not have an alibi on 15 March 2020.

### Alibi for 10 March 2013

238    Much less hinged on Mr Loh’s alibi for the afternoon of 10 March 2013 than 24 February 2013 and 15 March 2013, as there was no assertion that any criminal act occurred on this date. This was the date identified by the prosecution to be that of his third training session with Ms C. Were Mr Loh able to prove his alibi, he would have been able to make inroads to the credibility of Ms C and her father. To recapitulate, Ms C had averred to the third session occurring on a Sunday between the other two sessions, and Mr F had given evidence that this had been an individual session, although he was not able to recall that the event had been held on a Sunday. Both prosecution and defence have agreed that Mr F’s recollection that the session had occurred on a weekday could not be correct. Nevertheless, Mr F’s testimony, if believed, would undermine Mr Loh’s insistence that no individual training sessions were ever conducted for Ms C.

239    For this date, Mr Loh’s principal, if not sole witness (not counting the accused himself) was DW7; Mr Tan Wei Leong. Mr Loh himself stated that he had, on 10 March 2013, met Tan Wei Leong (DW7) at the Venus run on the morning of 10 March 2013 had lunch with him, and then both disported to the Swift club meet at Toa Payoh stadium from 2.00 p.m. to “4.00-_plus_” p.m., then to a coffeeshop until 6.00-_plu_s p.m. when Mr Loh left for home.

### Accused’s account

240    Mr Loh’s evidence was that the Venus Run had been an event held under the _aegis_ of the Singapore Athletic Association’s Women’s Committee, and he had been a vice-president, with a portfolio of organising competition, which required him to oversee the event. The Venus Run was a celebration of International Women’s Day and involved some 2000 participants The competition had occupied the morning of 10 March 2013, starting at 7:30am with a flag off at Marina Barrage.[^232] The race had been run by 9.00 am and proceedings had then involved prize giving, and other events. Mr Loh had recounted his meeting with a multitude of figures in the sports fraternity[^233]. DW5: Ms Michelle Eng had also been there as an announcer.

241    In the course of the post-race festivities, Mr Loh had run into the Mr Tan Wei Leong, who was the coach and the president of Zoom Club, an athletic organisation. Mr Loh had then made appointment with Mr Tan for lunch Toa at Payoh and for the two men to spend the afternoon at an athletic meet; which Mr Loh referred to as “_Swift Athletic Club_” which was holding their annual sports event on 9-10 March 2013 at Toa Payoh Stadium. Counsel prompted the court that this was the _Akira Swift 60th Anniversary Track and Field Championship 2013_. She produced a screengrab from _Singapore Athletics’_ website[^234]_._ The notice had identified _Akira Swift Club_ as an affiliate of the _Singapore Athletic Association_ but had also incorporated a disclaimer_:_

> **_Akira Swift 60th Annual Track & Field Championships 2013_**

> Note: This is a meet by one of SAA’s affiliate (_sic_), **_and SAA was not involved in the event._** The results was (_sic_) compiled by Swift Athlete Association. For any dispute or queries, please contact them,

> Date: 9-10 March

> Venue: Toa Payoh Stadium …

242    It was therefore quite evident that as the Singapore Athletic Society was explicitly “_not involved in the event_”, Mr Loh had no official role in the meet. Mr Loh had nevertheless, after a lunch shared in Toa Payoh Hub with Mr Tan, allegedly proceeded to the sporting event. The accused explained that affiliated clubs were autonomous from the Singapore Athletic Association and ran their clubs independently and organised their own sporting meets. All Singaporeans could participate, and schools would send their athletes to the event. Notwithstanding that the Singapore Athletic Association was not organising; the Swift Akira meet was of interest to him as this was the longest-running track and field club in Singapore. Mr Loh indicated that he and Mr Tan had athletes whom they knew taking part in this meet.[^235] He was also interested in engaging with their high-performance side, and get a sense of how Akira Swift Club ran because they had used “_very little of our_ (i.e. Singapore Athletic Association’s) _technical officials_” He added that Akira Swift Club “_prefer to use their official(_s_) because they want to save cost._” Essentially, because Akira Swift used their own officials, he felt it incumbent to attend, as he would make it a practice to observe “_when all the bona fide club organised the meet_” as one of his “_many, many function_(s) _in the_ (Singapore Athletic Association)[^236].

243    Mr Loh had met Mr Tan Wei Leong at 1:00 pm and after lunch, gone to Toa Payoh Stadium at “_2.00 pm plus_.” He had spent about two hours there and left at “_4.00 pm plus_” Mr Loh had left together with Mr Tan, where they had repaired at the “_same coffee shop_.” The two men spent some 45 minutes, or an hour engaged in “chit-chat”, then had our dinner at the premises before Mr Loh left Toa Payoh at “_around 6 plus_” to 7.00 pm for home.

### Evidence of DW 7 Tan Wei Leong

244    Mr Tan Wei Leong was a certified International Athletics Federation coach and the founder of Club Zoom, which was officially sanctioned by Singapore Athletic Association on 8 August 2012. Mr Tan had known Ms C while he was employed as a coach in her school. He had, however, left her school by the time Ms C had graduated and begun training with Mr Loh. Mr Tan maintained close ties with Mr Loh, whom he had known since 2005, and Mr Loh’s private athletes were able to compete under Club Zoom’s colours, particular those who had graduated from schools. Mr Tan had been previously been a member of Akira Swift Club but had, in 2009, “_due to some politics_”[^237] left the club. Mr Tan had attended the Venus Run as his wife had been an organiser, and an employee of the Singapore Athletic Association.

245    Mr Tan had bumped into Mr Loh at the car park of this Marina Barrage but was not aware if the latter had been driving that day. He recalled this encounter to be around “_8 plus 9_”.He indicated that while the race would have started at 7:30 am, he found nothing unusual in Mr Loh being there at the time, as there was “_normally no need_ (for Mr Loh ) _to be there at the beginning_” [^238]and that Mr Loh’s role was principally to be present at the prize presentation. Mr Tan had inquired after Mr Loh’s schedule and realised that the latter had also intended to go to the Akira Swift event. Mr Tan added that Club Zoom had “_over a hundred members_”[^239] It was not entirely clear in retrospect whether Mr Tan was referring to his club’s size or the number of members taking part in the Akira Swift competition, although my impression then was that he meant the latter, given the context of the question being his club’s participation in the Akira Swift event. Rather confusingly, Mr Tan later alluded, at cross-examination, to his club having just 30 athletes at the time, who were average runners with “_no shining star_”[^240] as his reason for not paying attention to who was running that day.

246    Mr Tan added that during their subsequent lunch, Mr Loh had expressed his interest in going to the Akira Swift event to look into the adequacy of their officiating, as the Akira Swift meet had “_bad reputation… of poor organising_” The problems included athlete reporting points which were not clearly demarcated and issues with accurate time-keeping. Mr Tan alluded to there being some antecedent bad blood between the two men and the Swift club to the point that “_even when we are there_ (at the Akira Swift meet) _we are not welcome, yah. That means we just sit at the corner_”. [^241] Despite these issues, the Akira Swift event attracted large crowds of “_always about 600 plus_” equivalent in size to higher prestige events like SPH relays. Mr Tan claimed that he and Mr Loh had kept a low profile and generally avoided making contact. The two men stayed at a location called a “core room” which was an **_open space_** in the vicinity of the 100-metre start line at the grandstand[^242]. The core room was a “_fall-in_” point for athletes to assemble, indicate their presence and wait their turn, and was thus a veritable node for operations.

247    As a juxtaposition, Mr Loh had also claimed as follows[^243]:

> I went there to sit and my, uh, ‘Zoom Club’ \[_inaudible_\][^244]. We sit at the corner there. We don’t want---we just want to observe the meet. We sit there and see the meet. Many, many plu---faces but we never show it to them. We just sit at the corner and watch the meet…

> **_I cannot remember_** _(seeing)_ **_anyone_** _._

> \[Emphasis added}

### Analysis of alibi evidence for 10 March 2013

248    I found this scenario eminently implausible. Even in an atmosphere of internecine intrigue and the rivalry described by Mr Tan and Mr Loh among the competing clubs, it would be natural to expect displays of **_overt_** civility, hospitality and comity among fellow members of the track and field community, who would also be expected to hold good sportsmanship as a creed. Mr Loh was vice-president of their umbrella body; the Singapore Athletic Association, and it would be strange if his attendance at the event was both formally and informally unacknowledged by Swift club, or indeed other affiliate club members. Even if their purpose was to observe the proceedings unobtrusively, the spot they had picked was an extremely **_conspicuous_** one. Mr Tan was emphatic of their desire to lie low, and at cross-examination even alluded to hostility between the Swift club **_and Mr Loh himself_**, which made the claimed clandestine mission all the more improbable. If there was any antagonism with Swift Club, Mr Loh’s mere presence there, even _incognito_, would be a statement in itself. Also this position was incongruent with Mr Loh’s stated plan to “_engage the high-performance side_” of Swift club, which obviously pointed to a form of cooperative enterprise. Mr Tan had stated[^245]:

>   
| 

DPP

 | 

And did you go up to anybody to say, “Hello” at the meet itself? You and Mr. Loh?

 |
| 

Mr Tan

 | 

Because we are---like I said dispute, um, we want to lie low. We---**_we don’t want to be prominent there_**…

Uh, and **_they are not welcoming to us_**. Yah.

 |
| 

DPP

 | 

But lie low, so where were you in the stadium actually?

 |
| 

Mr Tan

 | 

Near to the finishing line.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

I understand that you are in a state of dispute, but **_Mr. Loh is not in a state of dispute with them, right_**? Is he?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

We---**_we are all_**.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

**_Both_**?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

**_Yes_**.

 |
| 

{Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

249    Ultimately, Mr Loh’s expressed motive to personally attend and informally ‘audit’ the proceedings by surveillance from his chosen vantage-point seemed peculiar given that no technical officials of the Singapore Athletic Association were present to be assessed, and any fault-finding exercise would be pointless as Swift club’s reason for using their own officials for the Akira Swift event was to simply to save cost. I did not recall Mr Loh ever explaining how his investigations would have advanced the interests of the Singapore Athletic Association, or its affiliate clubs. There was also an inescapable contradiction between Mr Loh’s undisguised derision at what he perceived to be Swift club’s organisational mediocrity, reportedly leading to delays, crowds and confusion in the Akira Swift event, and his declared interest in co-opting Swift club in even more complex areas as high-performance athletics.

250    By the same token, it seemed curious if there were indeed either 30 or 100 members of Club Zoom there (given Mr Tan’s two differing responses), that Mr Loh did not recognise any of these competitors, despite the club president sitting next to him. Given the nature of the “core room” as an assembly and waiting area, it would be expected that **_all_** competing athletes would have reported there and waited at length for their event. Mr Tan had testified to himself at most exchanging “_hi_” greetings with some of “_the usual Swift members_” from a distance but could not recall any of their names.[^246] The setting the accused and his witness sought to portray was starkly different from images presented by the defence of Mr Loh being a highly extroverted and popular personality and frequently shown posing with competitors and sporting figures. Given this I would be in agreement with the learned DPP’s submission in relation to the accounts of Mr Loh and DW7 on his alibi evidence for the afternoon of 10 March 2013[^247]:

> 235.  None of them were able to testify as to who else they met or saw, claiming that they just sat in one corner of the stadium and observed. This is impossible that no one had come up to them, and that they could not recognise anyone else who had attended, given Mr Loh’s reputation in the track circle. It is also not Mr Loh’s style to sit in a corner, and incongruous for them to do so, when they were supposedly there to see how the officials ran the meet…

### Other unaccountable deficits in DW7’s recall

251    Mr Tan Wei Leong could not recall the name of the guest of honour for the Akira Swift meet, and merely issued a terse response “_No, I can’t remember. We didn’t pay attention to it as well_.”[^248] An issue which would be more cogent to Mr Tan’s reliability as a witness would be Mr Tan’s contention that there had been **_no_** rain when he left Toa Payoh Stadium after the Akira Swift event, and that he did not recall any subsequent episodes of rain. Mr Tan’s account also differed from Mr Loh in that he claimed to have stayed at Toa Payoh Stadium for a full **_three_** hours, from 2.00pm to **_5.00_** pm[^249], where Mr Loh had claimed to have remained for just two hours from 2.00pm to “4 plus”. This exchange between Mr Tan and the learned DPP is salient to this point and gives valuable context to the premises leading to the witness’ responses, and therefore reproduced:

>   
| 

DPP:

 | 

And you were saying at about 5pm, you went to the same coffee shop which is across the road?

 |
| 

Mr Tan:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

DPP:

 | 

And you went by the overhead bridge, I assume?

 |
| 

Mr Tan:

 | 

No. The---once out of the stadium, cross the road, there’s no---there’s---I mean the overhead is further down. So you just cross the road then directly walk to the coffee shop.

 |
| 

DPP:

 | 

Was it sheltered?

 |
| 

Mr Tan

 | 

Uh, no sheltered.

 |
| 

DPP:

 | 

**_Was is raining or sunny?_**

 |
| 

Mr Tan:

 | 

**_It’s not raining, lah._**

 |
| 

DPP:

 | 

And at the coffee shop you had---dinner you saying?

 |
| 

Mr Tan:

 | 

Yah.

 |
| 

DPP:

 | 

And both of you left to the MRT station together?

 |
| 

Mr Tan:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

DPP:

 | 

**_When you left, was it raining?_**

 |
| 

Mr Tan:

 | 

**_No._**

 |

  
  

252    Mr Tan’s account was contradicted by a Rainfall Tabulation report from the Meteorological Service[^250] showing an extended episode of rain on 10 March 2013 at the vicinity of Toa Payoh Stadium (as was also the case for Tampines Stadium). Collections were taken from a rain gauge at Beatty Secondary School, which was the site nearest Toa Payoh Stadium. The report indicated that rain had started from 5.00pm and had continued for a full 45 minutes from 6.00pm to 7.00 pm, accumulating 14.6 mm of rain, logging the **_third heaviest_** bout of rain for 1-18 March 2013 for the Toa Payoh precinct. The rain had persisted with lesser intensity for 15 minutes from 7.00pm to 8.00 pm, and yet another 15 minutes from 8.00pm to 9.00pm.

253    To be fair, the report does not specify exactly when the rainfall **_began_** within the 5.00pm-6.00pm bloc in the tabulation chart. Nevertheless, given that the rain spanned four hourly time-blocs on the chart, it seems improbable that Mr Tan could have been oblivious to this extended period of 80 minutes of cumulative precipitation. Mr Tan’s testimony was that there had been **_no_** rain when he left the coffeeshop. To recapitulate, it was Mr Loh’s evidence that he had, after their shared meal parted ways with Mr Tan at “_6 plus to 7.00 pm_”. Mr Tan recanted after being confronted, conceding that “_I can’t remember the weather_”,[^251] despite his earlier certitude of clear weather conditions.

### Verdict on alibi for afternoon of 10 March 2013

254    Hence Mr Loh’s _alibi_ evidence for the afternoon of 10 was riven by issues including the _actual_ purpose of attending the Swift Akira meet with Mr Tan Wei Leong within hours of the Venus Run event at the Marina Barrage. Mr Loh’s presence was near ubiquitous at the Venus Run, and he could show that he had been featured in images with the celebrated pioneer runner Mr C Kunalan Ms Michelle Eng and Ms Jaya had also been in attendance. There was thus a stark contrast with the subsequent event which he allegedly attended with Mr Tan, where no photographic proof was ever adduced. The purpose for this visit was ill-defined and contradictory objectives being put forward; with Mr Loh simultaneously embarking in a semi-secretive fault-finding exercise on organisational foibles of the club, and yet desiring engagement to put forward a cooperative proposal on “_high performance_” athletics.

255    Like the evidence of alibi witness DW2: Mr Terry Tan, Mr Tan Wei Leong’s evidence did not match Mr Loh’s account on the timings for the sequence of events, especially in his claim to have sat for a full three hours till 5.00pm, while Mr Loh had claimed that the party had adjourned back to the coffee shop somewhat earlier at “_4 plus_”. Mr Tan could not recall the rain at all despite the adverse weather conditions at the time. Most tellingly, despite both men having long associations in the local sports scene, neither could name a single athlete who took part in the Akira Swift event on 10 March 2013.

256    Considering the above, I was of the view that Mr Loh had not proven his _alibi_ for the afternoon of 10 March 2013, on a balance of probabilities.

## ANALYSING THE CONSISTENCY AND COHERENCE OF BOTH THE PROSECUTION AND DEFENCE CASES

### Accused’s conduct after being notified of charges against him

257    Mr Loh was notified of that reports had been made against him on 31 July 2016, and that he was accordingly required to attend at a police station for his statement to be recorded. While Mr Loh had attended in person at the Police Station, he had not made a statement on that date as the accused had complained of feeling unwell after a recent minor procedure. He was given a deferment to 2 August 2016. The investigation officer in charge had been Inspector Goh Teck Heng, who was called as a rebuttal witness after Mr Loh had made certain assertions of Ms C’s and Ms W’s identities being revealed to him from a police source **_before_** the recording of his statement on 2 August 2016.

258    The issue had arisen after Mr Loh had attended the meeting with IO Goh bearing two images; one showing Ms C[^252] bearing a trio of cup-cakes with Ms W and Mr Loh standing by her side and other athletes looking on, taken from a social media post from “_Josepth_” with a date stamp of 31 July 2016 at 8.50pm; and the other being an image of Ms W in a convivial group shot with Mr Loh from a post from “_Choo_” date stamped 31 July 2016 at 8.55pm. The fact that Mr Loh seemed to know who **_both_** of his accusers were, even before his statement was recorded would be a significant detail to the case. This being so as it was standard investigative procedure not to reveal the names of putative victims in such circumstances. The fact that Mr Loh had asserted otherwise required that IO Goh be called as a rebuttal witness.

### Evidence of PW11, Inspector Goh Teck Heng

259    Inspector Goh Teck Heng (IO Goh) had joined the police force in 1988 and worked in the property and violent offences squad within the investigation branch of Tanglin Police Station at the material time. IO Goh, then a Senior Station Inspector, had been the duty officer at the time, and had received the reports of Ms C and Ms W on 30 July 2016, which was a Saturday. He had contacted Mr Loh by mobile phone on the morning of 31 July 2016 to inform him that reports had been lodged against Mr Loh and that IO Goh had required Mr Loh “_to come down to assist in our investigation_”. [^253] IO Goh was explicit that he did not reveal the contents of the report over the phone not what offence Mr Loh was being investigated for. The investigation officer was explicit that he would be in no position to reveal who the complainants were. IO Goh had planned to see Mr Loh “_in person and to ask him directly_”[^254] to address the complaint. Accordingly, IO Goh had proposed a meeting with Mr Loh at 2.30pm that day.

260    Mr Loh had accordingly attended at Tanglin Police Station and was invited to the interview room where he told IO Goh that he was covered by a hospitalization medical certificate as he had recently undergone an operation and was not “_in a proper state of health or condition to be interviewed_”. He thus requested that the interview be rescheduled. IO Goh recalled that when he had asked him “_what is the allegation about_”, he had briefly told him the complaints were in relation to his being “_touchy towards the victims_”[^255]. Before he left, Mr Loh let on that he was a vice president of the Singapore Athletic Association and also “_a former superintendent of prison_(s)”[^256]

261    IO Goh had granted Mr Loh a reprieve to 2 August 2016 and told him that he would be interviewed by his (IO Goh’s) colleague. The investigation officer was explicit that he would not reveal the names of the putative victims as there was a risk that a suspect would “_go and destroy evidence or contact the victims_.”[^257] IO Goh indicated that he had contacted Ms W that morning. His initial recollection was that he had called her before he had called Mr Loh but was corrected by defence counsel that he had made the call to Ms W after two calls to Mr Loh. Essentially, the calls to Mr Loh were made at 9.24 am (3.4 minutes) and 9.28 am (2.4 minutes), and the call to Ms W had been made at 9.33 am (1.7 minutes) on 31 July 2016[^258]. IO Goh stated that the calls to Mr Loh had been to ask him to attend for an interview, but he could not recall what the call to Ms W had been for, but believed it was to clarify a detail in her report.

262    At cross-examination, counsel had attempted to link this call with Ms C’s message[^259] to Ms Michelle Eng where Ms C had alluded to Ms W telling her that “_the officers_” had breached an understanding not to reveal their names to Mr Loh, and that “_they_” had called Ms W to “_to say that they had no choice, cos mr Loh kept saying he has too many students etc and they said our names_”. The defence’s position was that IO Goh had made such a confession to Ms W during the call logged at 9.33 am, after he had leaked their names to Mr Loh. Counsel put it to the investigation officer that Mr Loh had insisted that he be told the names of the complainants when IO Goh had called him. He had also demanded to know the type of complaint that had been lodged against him. Counsel further put it to IO Goh that it had been only after he had told Mr Loh the names of the complainants and the substance of the complaints that Mr Loh agreed to proceed to the police station, adding that the fact Mr Loh had turned up at 2:30 pm, was because IO Goh had relented and told him the name of the complainants.

### Defence had never put it to PW4 that PW11 was the source of the leak

263    While the proximity of the calls by IO Goh to Mr Loh and Ms W seemed circumstantially significant and counsel’s hypothesis did not seem, at a superficial level, an unreasonable conclusion, a closer analysis militated against this possibility. The first problem was that counsel’s hypothesis that IO Goh had communicated to Ms W about this disclosure, was **_never put_** to Ms W herself, even as the “leak” issue was featured extensively in the cross-examination of Ms C[^260], PW7; IO Nur Sahidah Binte Ibrahim[^261], PW8; IO Alan Khor[^262] and the examination-in-chief of DW 5; Ms Michelle Eng[^263]. This curious anomaly would offend against the rule in _Browne_ v _Dunn_ (1893) 6 R 67 at 70 and 76. The fact remains that this failure to put their hypothesis to Ms W would leave the court in the dark as to whether the curiously **_plural_** reference of “_the officers_” and “_they_” in the message was in reference to the communication that Ms W had with IO Goh at 9.33 am. Counsel’s omission is curious as the identity “_leak_” issue had already been brought out in counsel’s cross-examination in the course of the testimony of PW3; Ms C, who was the witness **_preceding_** PW4; Ms W. The defence has of course never applied to recall Ms W. The defence’s main basis for making this allegation seemed to arise from the fact that IO Goh had been the **_only_** known police officer who spoke to both Mr Loh and Ms W in the morning of 31 July 2013.Two other female investigation officers were involved in the filing of the police reports on 30 July 2016, but neither had been connected in any dealings with Mr Loh. It should be also noted that IO Goh never spoke to Ms C herself.

### PW4 was prone to factual conflation and confusion

264    As indicated in a foregoing section in these grounds,[^264] I expressed my view that Ms W’s loose way of connecting facts and events led to her conflation of facts, and a tendency to render confused situational reporting. She had, after all, believed Mr A, a platonic friend of Ms C with a homosexual orientation, and Ms C’s boyfriend; Mr B (whom Ms C had not yet even met at the material time) to be the **_same_** individual. This was despite Ms C referring to Mr A by name in their _WhatsAp_p messages, and that Mr B’s name was so distinctly different as to make confusion unlikely.

### PW11’s call and the harassing call from accused’s trainee had both been made on the morning of 31 July 2016

265    The conversation between Ms W and IO Goh had occurred at 9.33 am. Ms W had also at some point at that very morning, received the harassing call from Ms T. When Ms T called, it seems likely that Ms T would have had to explain how she **_knew_** of the police reports being filed while harassing Ms W and upbraiding her for filing her report. The most obvious ‘_cover-story_’ explanation would be that the police had somehow caved in to identify the two complainants because Mr Loh’s large pool of female trainees made it hard for Mr Loh to respond to the allegations made. Given the proximity in time between the two calls in the morning of 31 July 2016, I could not exclude the **_possibility_** that Ms W, given her history of making loose situational connections, had conflated a lie (told by Ms T to account for her apparent knowledge of the reports) that Ms T might have simply communicated to her over the phone, to be something that had actually occurred (i.e. that “_the officers_” had leaked the identity of the two accusers to Mr Loh), and framed this distorted narrative to Ms C, which she (Ms C) had duly informed Ms Michelle Eng of in her _WhatsApp_ message. Again, we are none the wiser as Ms W was never examined on this area when she gave her testimony.

### There is no reason for PW11 to be overawed or beholden to the accused as to leak the identities of the complainants to him

266    In their ‘_put’_ questions, counsel had contended Mr Loh had required IO Goh to state the names of the complainants and the substance of the complaints before he would agree to go to the police station for an interview, and that IO Goh had relented to give the names of the complainants. According to her, it was on these premises that Mr Loh agreed to proceed and did attend at the police station at 2.30 pm for his first attendance. IO Goh denied having entered into any such arrangement.

267    I found the scenario unlikely for a number of reasons. The first would be that it seemed implausible that an experienced investigation officer would have been so **_pliant_** as to allow a suspect to dictate the terms of his attendance at a police station after complaints of serious sexual crimes had been made against that person by two accusers. With regard to IO Goh’s experience, IO Goh had joined the police force in 1988, and was an officer of 28 years standing at the material time. He had also been in the investigation service from 1996m and would thus have accumulated 20 years’ experience as an IO. He had begun with immigration and drug cases and branched into offences against individuals in 2013[^265] in a unit dubbed the _Violence Against Persons_ (VAP) squad[^266].

268    To say the least, the notion that the identity of a complainant must be protected to prevent a suspect from suborning, harassing or even harming his accuser before the suspect’s statement was recorded, must have been one of the most sacrosanct and **_hard-wired_** tenets adhered to by police investigation officers. The other two police officers in the prosecution’s list of witnesses, PW7 W/Sgt Nur Sahidah Bte Ibrahim (who recorded the First Information Report) and PW 8; Station Inspector (SI) Alan Khor (the extant investigation officer), also attested that they would not have revealed the name of the putative victims to a suspect before his statement was recorded. Indeed, IO Sahidah had indicated that the two reports had been specially marked ‘**_sensitive_**’ with special redactions done before they were input into the SPF’s FOCUS system to protect the identity of the complainants[^267]. SI Khor stated that he had been assigned the case on 1 August 2016, and only revealed the identity of the putative victims on 2 August 2016, when he had met the accused and recorded Mr Loh’s statements[^268].

269    The allegation made of a “leak” in Ms C’s _WhatsApp_ communication with Ms Michelle Eng had been made in the late morning of 31 July 2016. IO Goh’s interaction with Mr Loh had at that point encompassed just two brief mobile calls at 9.24 am for 3.4 minutes, and 9.28 am for 2.4 minutes. The total elapsed time would be 5.8 minutes (or 5 minutes and 48 seconds).

270    I could not understand how the defence could contend that IO Goh would, in the space of a tele-conversation of under six minutes, be persuaded to disregard his two decades of conditioning as an investigation officer, which was to never reveal the name of a complainant, until the suspect had been brought before him for his statement to be recorded. IO Goh seemed to me to be a mature officer who could see through Mr Loh’s bid, later that day, to overawe him by stating that he was a vice president of the Singapore Athletic Association and volunteering the otherwise irrelevant fact that he had been a Prisons officer of high seniority[^269], even as he (Mr Loh) had been disinclined to offer any substantive evidence at that occasion, as he was recovering from a minor surgery. Mr Loh’s bid to impress IO Goh had of course occurred at the face-to-face meeting at 2.30 pm on 31 July 2016, and thus IO Goh would not have even known anything about Mr Loh during the two mobile tele-conversations earlier that morning, save for what had been stated by Ms C and Ms W in their police reports. Since IO Goh, as discerned from the content of his testimony, did not know Mr Loh at all, there would be no reason to suspect that he would have been beholden to him, or otherwise so compromised as to let his guard down to reveal the putative victims’ identities before taking Mr Loh’s statement.

271    Ultimately, I was satisfied that IO Goh never revealed Ms C’s and Ms W’s names to Mr Loh either in the morning or the afternoon of 31 July 2016. My considered opinion is that the defence had mounted this challenge after it became evident that Mr Loh’s production of the images of Ms C and Ms W on 2 August 2016 would leave the awkward unresolved question of how he would have known that these were the complainants if he were indeed training over 50 athletes from CHIJ Toa Payoh (35-40[^270] female students), Catholic Junior College (15[^271] students) and Nanyang Technological University, along with a cadre of aspiring National athletes and private students.

### The production of P23-1, a photograph featuring Ms C celebrating her birthday with him in April 2013 suggested that Mr Loh knew the date of the offences before his police interview on 2 August 2016

272    The production of P23-1, which is an image of Ms C holding three cupcakes, and standing with Mr Loh, Ms W on the first row and three male athletes behind, created another quandary for Mr Loh. This was that his presentation of the image, with a view to rebutting the molestation allegations, suggested that he was **_aware_** of the proximate date and time of the offences, where he had sought to show that he had been on amicable terms with Ms C in the immediate period after that, in April 2013. Mr Loh had confirmed that he had gone to the police station with the photographic image on 2 August 2013 and had sought to demonstrate to the IO as follows[^272]:

> Because IO told me that I violate (Ms C), I molested (Ms C). So I’m trying to explain to---to the IO that we training together, we continue to train together, with a very happy occasion together. And she celebrated her birthday together with us in a happy mood and I---I was shocked that why this--this thing happened…

273    Mr Loh explained that the celebration had been Ms C’s 19th birthday, with the venue being Catholic Junior College, and that he had sought to demonstrate that Ms C had continued training with him. The accused had claimed that the photographs had been among those spontaneously sent to him by concerned trainees. He had told his trainees the names of the accusers contending “_If I don’t tell I’m not normal person_”. [^273]

274    Mr Loh related his call with IO Goh in the following terms[^274]:

>   
| 

Mr Loh:

 | 

(_IO Goh_) told me, “The girl---2 girls complain that you molested them”.

 |
| 

DPP

 | 

Okay. And what… additional information was… given to you?

 |
| 

Mr Low

 | 

uh, I want to know who are the girls…And (he) told me these 2 girls.

 |
| 

DPP

 | 

So you are saying that the officer…told you---

 |
| 

Mr Low

 | 

whether I went down, (_he_) told me o---over the phone he told me.

 |
| 

DPP:

 | 

Okay.

 |
| 

Mr Low

 | 

I think it’s over the phone he told me---over the phone he told me. **_I say you must tell me who were the girls otherwise I won’t come down_**. **_Then he told me over the phone._** I believe I can remember it’s over the phone…

 |
| 

\[Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

275    Mr Loh goes on reiterate the ultimatum he made several times over the next few pages of transcript, and also repeatedly contending that IO Goh had indeed revealed the names of the two complainants[^275].

>   
| 

DPP:

 | 

Now, Mr. Loh, **_the IO did not tell you the date of the complaint in the phone call or in his face to face meeting with you. Yes?_**

 |
| 

(_after DPP clarifies confusion whether question is with reference to IO Goh or SI Alan Khor_)

 |
| 

DPP

 | 

**_No, talking about Mr. ‘Goh’._**

 |
| 

Mr Low

 | 

**_Oh, of course, Mr. ‘Goh’ never tell me, yes._**

 |
| 

DPP

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Mr Low

 | 

I agree.

 |
| 

DPP

 | 

**_Mr. ‘Goh’ never tell you, right?_**

 |
| 

Mr Low

 | 

**_Yah---yah._**

 |
| 

DPP

 | 

**_I put it to you that the reason you obtained this photograph taken in April 2013 which you knew was after the incident could only be because, you had personal knowledge of the incident._**

 |
| 

Mr Loh

 | 

Any normal people---any normal people by reading this thing whatever evidence they say they will come out. I disagree what you say.

 |
| 

\[Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

276    I noted that Mr Loh seemed at a loss as to how to respond to DPP Gail Wong’s ‘_put_’ question. In her submissions, the learned DPP explained how Mr Loh might have found himself metaphorically hoist by his own petard by his untimely production of the image of Ms C celebrating her 19th birthday, which he had obtained in the night of 31 July 2013 and presented to SI Alan Khor at the statement recording session on 2 August 2013, stating[^276]:

> 181.  The police did not tell him the date/time of the alleged offending before his statement was taken, and the photograph was procured as early as 31 July 2016. **_Aside from the police, only the people present at the time of offending, Mr Loh and the victim, could have known when the offending took place_**. The only way that Mr Loh could have known the relevance of the photograph sent to him on 31 July 2016, was because he had committed the offences, and knew exactly when they had occurred. Nobody else could have offered that information to him – none of his trainees who provided him with the photographs and other materials. Mr Loh did not offer any other explanation for how he could have known the date of the offending before any police statements were recorded from him.

> \[Emphasis added\]

### Implications of accused’s production of exhibit P23-1

277    To be clear, the image of the birthday celebration in **_April_** 2013 seemed to be an exercise to assure of normality, if not cordiality, in relations between Ms C and Mr Loh. This thus fixed the date for the offending to be **_before_** April 2013. Because Ms C had continued with **_group_** trainings (albeit on a more sporadic basis), there had been no **_cut-off point_** in the trainer-trainee relationship to “telegraph” or cue Mr Loh of any significant date that the relationship had precipitously floundered. The only reference point would be of course the **_individual_** training sessions with Ms C, which ended after 15 **_March_** 2013, and which Mr Loh contended to have never been held. Hence, even if the accused had continued to argue that IO Goh revealed Ms C’s name in a tele-conversation on 31 July 2013 (which I held to be unlikely for the reasons stated in the foregoing part of these grounds), Mr Loh explicitly acknowledged that IO Goh had never told him of the date or dates where the offences were committed. More than three years had elapsed by then, hence his production of the image on 2 August 2016 would have cast a shadow of suspicion over his apparent ‘_prescience_’ of the relevant dates, where Ms C’s association with Mr Loh had spanned a duration from late-2012 to a time in 2014.

### Statement of Accused on 2 August 2016

278    As Mr Loh’s defence was grounded on his alibi on the three significant dates, his case would necessarily be a bare denial of any event where any act of molestation occurred, the only other competing version of events which needed to be dealt with would be Mr Loh’s characterisation of his encounter with Ms C’s father. An account of this encounter was _inter alia_, featured in his police statement of 2 August 2016. The salient parts of Mr Loh’s police statement are set out below:

>

There are around 35 to 40 trainees in CHIJ Toa Payoh and there were 15 trainees at Catholic JC. I cover only sprinting for Catholic JC and for CHIJ Toa Payoh, I cover all the track and field events. I conducted training for CHIJ on Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 3. 15pm to 5. 15pm and for Catholic JC, I start from 5pm to 7pm on Tuesday and Thursday for off-peak season and for peak season I also conduct training on Monday. I also have some National athletics under my training and sometimes I will conduct training with them after the school training. Sometimes I conduct training for them on Saturday at Toa Payoh, Bishan or Tampines stadium depending on the availability of the stadium and the convenience of the trainees. I am paid for the training conducted for the school but for the National athletics _(sic)_, I did it voluntarily.

### Accused’s denial of meeting with father in an individual session and claim of having had seen him at a joint training event

279    As the other aspects in the case which are referenced in the statement have already been dealt with in the foregoing, I will be addressing Mr Loh’s account of his meeting Ms C’s father. As Mr Loh had already in an earlier question[^277] stated that Ms C had never engaged in individual trainings with him, I believe that Mr Loh had been boxed into a corner when the question of Ms C’s father’s having come to a training session was posed. Mr Loh would have been mindful of the fact that he had **_in fact_** met the father in the circumstances mentioned by Mr F when he gave his statement, which is to say, in an **_individual_** session at Tampines Stadium. As Mr Loh evidently tried his utmost not to recant on his response that he had never conducted individual sessions with Ms C, his initial response was to claim that he had met PW1 in a session where he had been **_also_** training other athletes in a joint session, but he could no longer remember who these athletes.[^278] Mr Loh stated that it would have been possible that Ms C’s father; Mr F, had seen him train other athletes at this joint training session. Mr Loh **_backtracked_** again in his response four questions later to a re-iterated question recorded as “_In that case are you sure you did not provide 1 to 1 training to_ (Ms W) _and_ (Ms C)?”, where he had responded “_Except_ (Ms C) _when the father was there_ **_I cannot remember whether I train her alone or with someone else_**_. I never train_ (Ms W) _one to one before_.”[^279].

280    At trial, Mr Loh appeared to have resolved his doubts, and responded with great certitude that he had **_never_** conducted individual training sessions with Ms C[^280]:

> Mr Loh:    …I did not---**_I cannot be so stupid to admit that I have a 1 to 1 training. I don’t have at all. I don’t have at all. I just---I just overlook this, uh, the question_**. My intention to tell that the---our friend, uh, uh, IO never, never asked me to further elaborate. My answer, my question, want to answer it, I do not have _(individual)_ training with her (i.e. Ms C) and even with (Ms W).

> \[Emphasis added\]

281    Mr Loh indicated that there were other trainees when he had met Ms C’s father on a Saturday in **_early January 2013_** at Tampines Stadium[^281]. Perhaps mindful of Mr F’s testimony that he had not seen any other trainees, Mr Loh ventured that Ms C’s father might not have seem the other athletes, as they were, _inter alia_, training on the Stadium’s public walkway, and that some had gone home by the time Ms C’s father had come. The accused attributed the difference between his testimonial account and his statement to his having “_overlooked_” the investigation officer’s question, as he had been in a “_very bad mood_”[^282] and “very upset”[^283] and thus failed to read the investigation officer’s transcription of what he had been telling the officer. Mr Loh also indicated that it had been raining, which explained why his athletes were occupying the walkway[^284]:

> Mr Loh     **_I don’t have one to one training. I have a group training. And if the raining_**, if---if at all de---**_it doesn’t mean the father’s seen nobody that mean nobody training with me_**. It was raining. The Tampines Stadium is big long enough outside the right corner the s---the other---outside the walkway is sheltered a lot of people can train, running outside the long stretch, out of the stadium is the long step really.

282    There were two problems with Mr Low’s account. The first was that it would be improbable that his recollection of an event in early 2013 could have more acute and precise when the accused gave his testimony in December 2018 than the wavering version when he provided the statement in August 2016. The second was that Mr F had the opportunity to observe for a considerable time, given that he had remained in the vicinity of Tampines Stadium for the entire, albeit truncated, training session. To recapitulate, Mr F’s testimony was that he had been present at an **_individual_** training session between Ms C and Mr Loh at Tampines Stadium, and had been certain that this had been the only trainee had been his daughter as he had not discerned the presence of any other trainees there. Mr F had apparently arrived **_first and_** noted that it had begun to rain when Mr Loh arrived at Tampines Stadium. Mr F had what he deemed a “_full view_” of Mr Loh instructing Ms C as she ran up and down the concrete slabs of the sheltered area of Tampines Stadium. It would be peculiar, if they were indeed there, that no other athlete ever approached Mr Low for instruction in the half-hour that Mr F, Mr Low and Ms C were there.

283    Yet another peculiarity is the fact that Ms C father took a rather bleak view of her daughter’s participation in track and field to the point of being deemed unsupportive. It was Ms Michelle Eng’s testimony that [^285]

>   
| 

Counsel

 | 

And tell us, start with the father first. Now, what was the father’s attitude towards (Ms C’s) track and field activity?

 |
| 

Ms Eng

 | 

Um, **_father was not supportive of her being in track and field_** and, uh, I mean, it’s because she was always injured, yah. So, father was---**_father objected quite a fair bit, asked her to quit_** during her 1st year of, um, being in track.

 |
| 

\[Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

284    It should thus be expected that an impetus would be necessary for Mr F, known to have scant interest in his daughter’s athletic endeavours, to make the special effort to attend Ms C’s training. The prosecution’s case does supply a **_reason_**, where the defence case does not. The prosecution’s case was of course premised on Ms C being concerned about what had happened at her attendance of the second **_individual_** training session, This had caused her to take pains to arrange for her father to attend the next session in Tampines Stadium with her. The preponderance of evidence was thus rather strongly aligned to Mr Loh’s meeting with Ms C’s father occurring on an **_individual_** training session, contrary to Mr Loh’s account.

### There was no record of any rain for the first two Saturday mornings in 2013

285    Ms Michelle Eng had also referenced a meeting between Ms C’s father and Mr Loh at a much earlier date than 10 March 2013. Ms Eng had stated that Ms C had told her that she was anxious for her father to meet Mr Loh and had thus made an arrangement for the two to meet: In her evidence-in-chief, Ms Eng had spontaneously introduced the topic by stating “Um, I vaguely recall that she mentioned asking her father to come for one of the trainees to meet Mr. Loh”:[^286].

>   
| 

Counsel:

 | 

What else can you recall from this conversation? Was it a conversation with (Ms C) or was---

 |
| 

Ms Eng

 | 

Yah…It was a conversation with her. Um---

 |
| 

Counsel

 | 

When was this conversation?

 |
| 

Ms Eng

 | 

Should be sometime **_end of December, early January of 2012 to 2013._** Um, what I recalled was, um she mentioned that her father brought her---either picked her up or brought her for one of the trainings, um, which was at Tampines Stadium, um**_, I think it was a Saturday morning_** and, um, she mentioned that her dad and Mr. Loh hit off quite well, she was actually quite, uh, relieved and happy that her father was able to speak to Mr. Loh and, therefore, able to approve of her continuing her training with Mr. Loh.

 |
| 

Counsel

 | 

Now, did she mention whether it was---what time it was during the day?

 |
| 

Ms Eng

 | 

**_Saturday trainings usually are in the morning_** based on what I recall and **_I think it was morning, should be morning_**, yah.

 |
| 

Counsel

 | 

And, subsequently was there any mention…of any other meeting that Ms C’s father had with Mr. Loh?

 |
| 

Ms Eng

 | 

No, **_that was the only one that she mentioned_** to me.

 |

  
  

286    As can be seem in the preceding passage, Mr Loh had himself asserted that the meeting with Mr Loh had occurred in **_early January 2013_**. Ms Eng, who had been his trainee for some five years while she studied at the Nanyang Technological University, had stated her belief that the session narrated by Ms C would have been a Saturday morning. The common part of Mr Loh’s, Ms C’s and Mr F’s accounts been the references to rain falling at the training session. I should add that another trainee DW6; Oon Kwan Yong had also recalled a conversation with Ms C at a training session that Ms C had recounted a past incident[^287]:

> …(Ms C) kind of mentioned to me, oh, like this incident happened where Mr. Loh and her father was sharing the umbrella and---and talking like in---it looks like cute, yah. **_I think during the training was probably raining then they were sharing umbrella together._** Then, they are talking about, you know, stuff and then (Ms C) say that, “Oh” like I mean, it’s rare to see like it’s 2 person sharing umbrella in---on the track and, uh, like, you know, and, uh, it’s like 2, uh, older men are sharing on the---the way---sharing the umbrella on the track.

287    A perusal of the hourly rainfall tabulation from records kept by the Meteorological Service[^288] would however show that there was **_no_** rainfall at all in the area around Tampines Stadium for the two **_Saturday mornings_** of early January 2013, which were 5 January 2013 and 12 January 2013.

### Statement by DW5; Michelle Eng

288    Before she took the stand as a prosecution witness, SI Khor had recorded a statement[^289]from Ms Michelle Eng. In the statement dated 14 October 2016, Ms Eng identified herself aa a teacher in Ms C’s previous school, where she taught Chemistry and was the head track teacher. She stated that her association with Mr Loh had begun from the time she had been in the NTU track team when he had been her coach and had been under him from 2006 to 2010.

289    Ms Eng had been Ms C’s PE teacher when she was in Secondary 3. and regarded Ms C as being “_good in the track_”. She had encouraged her to join the school team which she did. Ms C had switched to sprints when she was in JC 1, and while Ms Eng saw she was doing well in her particular event, she felt that she was not reaching her potential, and had then inquired if she would be inclined to train under Mr Loh. Ms C agreed to do so after her A levels. Ms C had told Mr Loh that Ms C had had “_potential but was not very developed._” Mr Loh had after considering Ms C’s timing and the kind of training she had before, decided to take her in.

290    According to her phone records, Ms Eng noted that Ms C had first met Mr Loh on 8 December 2012 at CHIJ Toa Payoh. Ms Eng and Mr Loh believed that Ms C had the potential to represent Singapore for the 2013 Sea Games. In the course of her early tutelage under Mr Loh, Ms C had told Ms Eng that she was “_hanging there as the training sessions were everyday but short_”.[^290] The salient parts of the remainder of Ms Eng’s statement discloses as follows:

On 5 January 2013, (Ms C) texted me that she is grateful for having such a great coach and he is really good. I encouraged her to continue training and she said that she is used to training every day. Occasionally we would chat over text messages.

Last year I was in (_a university in Singapore_) for a department, retreat and I met her in the school. We talk about her studies and her relationship issues. I can't recall whether she told me about Mr Loh during that meet up but I remember that she did mention about the incident with Mr Loh when I met her in June for another retreat in (_a local university_). She told me that she quit training because she was not comfortable with Mr Loh. **_She claimed that Mr Loh had touched her inappropriately. I recall seeing a coach giving her hamstring massage during one of her competitions in 2011 or 2012. I asked her then why did she allow the coach to massage her when he was not even her coach., She replied that she was injured and the coach said he is able to fix it and as such she allowed him to massage her. I told her she should not let the coach touch her if she is uncomfortable and I noticed that she was tearing when I said that._** (Ms C) **_is an innocent girl and was always protected by her parents as such when she told me about. been uncomfortable with Mr Loh, I thought Mr Loh might have also massaged her similarly and she was not comfortable with it. I asked her what she means by uncomfortable and she mentioned that Mr Loh had massaged her but did not tell me what happened during the massage. I did not ask her further as she didn’t seem like she wanted to elaborate. Later part of the day_**, (Ms C) **_texted me and said that Mr Loh had not only massaged her thigh but had also touched her private area. She told me it happened in March 2013_**. …

 |
| 

I asked her what she planned to do and she told me she had got over it. I don't know to believe her or not as **_I respect Mr Loh and all the years I had known him, he had not done anything inappropriate He is my mentor and is like a grandfather figure to the younger kids I had seen_**, (Ms C) **_is a good kid and had always been naive_**. I did not question or tell Mr Loh about this **_as I find it strange and awkward to do so._**

Towards the end of July 2016, (Ms C) texted me and told me she went to the police with (Ms W) Mr Loh called me and asked me why would (Ms C) do such a thing to him. He also asked whether (Ms C) had mentioned this to me before and I said no. I told him "no" just in case the allegation is true. Mr Loh is still in contact with female athletes since they were young and I am good friend with them too. **_To me if Mr Loh is out to prey on young girls he would have done so long time ago_**.

 |
| 

Ql.

 | 

Throughout your training with Mr Loh, did Mr Loh ever conduct one to one sessions?

 |
| 

Ans.

 | 

Yes but but it only with (_another female athlete_) one on one before.

 |
| 

Q2.

 | 

Does Mr Loh conduct training on Sunday?

 |
| 

Ans.

 | 

No.

 |
| 

Q3.

 | 

(Ms C) had mentioned to you that the incident happened on a Sunday Did you notice it?

 |
| 

Ans.

 | 

No

 |
| 

Q4.

 | 

Did you clarify with her about it since you mention that Mr Loh does not conduct training on a Sunday?

 |
| 

Ans.

 | 

**_No. I was too overwhelmed with her messages._**

 |
| 

Q5.

 | 

She also mentioned to you that Mr Loh had trained her individually Did you also clarify this with her?

 |
| 

Ans.

 | 

No.

 |
| 

Q6.

 | 

Has Mr Loh even massage you before?

 |
| 

Ans.

 | 

No.

 |
| 

Q7.

 | 

Is it normal for male coach to massage female athlete?

 |
| 

Ans.

 | 

I think it is common during my time, in the late 90s to early 2000s.

 |
| 

Q8.

 | 

If you find it common, why were you concerned that a male coach was massaging (Ms C) during the competition?

 |
| 

Ans:

 | 

**_The male coach is not her coach, he should not be touching (Ms C)._**

291    Ms Eng also answered further questions posed by SI Khor. She indicated that Mr Loh had conducted one-to-one sessions with another elite sprinter but answered the question “Does Mr Loh conduct training on Sunday?” in the negative. She had not clarified with Ms C’s reference of Sunday trainings as she had been “too overwhelmed” by Ms C’s WhatsApp messages. Differences between the accounts of DW5; Ms Michelle Eng and PW3; Ms C and PW5; Mr A

292    There are a number of differences between Ms Eng’s account and Ms C’s version of events. The most obvious among these being Ms Eng seeming not to recall Ms C bringing up an attenuated account of her encounters with Mr Loh in **_2013_**. Ms C’s account is of course backed up by her extensive chain of _WhatsApp_ messages with Mr A on 30 March 2013, as well as Mr A’s testimony on stiffening Ms C’s resolve to act, reminding her to “_tell Ms Eng_” and specifically prompting Ms Eng that Ms C had something to say to her. At the time the statement was recorded, Ms Eng would not have known of the 2013 _WhatsApp_ communications between Ms C and Mr A, which of course was a vital part of the prosecution’s case demonstrating a near-contemporaneous communication, along with a plan to raise the alleged sexual assaults with Ms Eng.

293    Ms Eng’s ignorance of these background developments would explain her hedging on these communications and with a vague reference that Ms C could possibly have brought up her discomfiture with Mr Loh’s massages after they had met at a university conference “_last year_” (i.e. in **_2015)_**. I also believe that Ms Eng’s hedging was to avoid the awkward question why she had done nothing for **_three_** years if she had known of Mr Loh administering massages to a female private trainee. This activity was specifically proscribed by the Sports SG’s _Coach’s Code of Ethics_ with Canon 6 of Key Ethical Standards stating “_Avoid sexual intimacy with your athlete. Any physical contact with your athletes should only be when absolutely necessary and during appropriate situations._“[^291] This would be all the more so more so where Ms C had articulated specific concerns about the manner of the physical contact she received.

294    In her subsequent court testimony, Ms Eng claimed that she had never received any prompting from Mr A in 2013 that Ms C had something to tell her, stating that Mr A “_after he graduated, never kept in touch_”.[^292] Quite ironically, while Ms Eng had taken umbrage because Ms C had allowed an **_outside_** coach to massage her and given thus as the basis for her reprimanding Ms C, the wording of the _Guide_ with the reference to “**_your_** _athlete_” appears to especially proscribe inappropriate conduct by coaches with **_their own_** athletes.

295    In relation to the foregoing, Ms Eng had brought out her discovery of Ms C being massaged previously at a competition in “2011 or 2012” by a coach who was not her own coach and mentioned Ms C’s emotional reaction when she (Ms Eng) had admonished her. This seemed, in my judgment, to be a set up for an argument that Ms C was preternaturally naïve, given her overly protective parents, and thus prone to mischaracterising Mr Loh’s well-intended massage to impute unjustified carnal overtones to the act. Ms Eng had thus attempted the straddle her delicate situation where both Ms C and Mr Loh were well known to her, by characterising the complaint to have been a misunderstanding of sorts. She had thus stressed her respect for Mr Loh and that he had never “_done anything inappropriate_” to her in the course of their long association. Ms Eng was open in regarding Mr Loh as her “_mentor and is like a grandfather figure to the younger kids_”.

296    On the other hand, Ms Eng stressed that she regarded Ms C as “_a good kid and had always been naïve_” as she was “_always protected_” by her parents. This would of course also make it easier for her to explain why she had done nothing when the complaints were first surfaced to her (in 2013, according to Ms C and Mr A) at the earliest, or upon her receipt of the tranche of _WhatsApp_ messages on 2 June 2016 (where Ms C had unburdened herself with complete disclosure of the alleged acts), at the latest. The latter date being a time span of almost two months before Ms C formally made a police report with Ms W on 31 July 2016.

### Testimony of DW 5

### PW5’s attempt to produce a picture of victim in cheerleading practice to show that that the complainant did not seem like a ‘typical’ victim

297    In the course of her testimony, it had transpired that Ms Eng had made attempts to contact the investigation officer and show him some images of Ms C in the period after the events alleged. Among the images was one of Ms C in a formation during cheerleading practice after she had enrolled in a local university. The image showed Ms C being held aloft by her fellow cheerleaders. Ms Eng had expressed her motivation to be because[^293]:

> I had concerns that she was a cheerleader and **_doesn’t look like she had any concerns of aftermath or fear or worry about being touched._** If she had gone through such a traumatizing experience as she put it out to me in her 2016 messages.

> \[Emphasis added\]

298    Ms Eng conceded that the investigation officer had never asked for such a picture, but she had, nevertheless, volunteered the image, and was told that Ms C’s subsequent activity of cheerleading was irrelevant to the investigation. Ms Eng acknowledged that the images concerned an activity that Ms C had engaged in in 2017, which was more than four years after she had stopped training with Mr. Loh. The witness had also stated that she had accompanied Mr Loh to his lawyer’s office in 2016. DPP Gail persisted to ask[^294]:

>   
| 

DPP:

 | 

Have you had students who were sexual crime victims, Ms. Eng?

 |
| 

Ms Eng

 | 

No.

 |
| 

DPP

 | 

**_Are you an expert on sexual crime victims’ behaviour_**?

 |
| 

Ms Eng

 | 

**_No._**

 |
| 

DPP:

 | 

Then you are in no position to say how victims of sexual crime will behave, yes?

 |
| 

Ms Eng

 | 

I did psychology as my degree, I did (counselling).

 |
| 

DPP:

 | 

**_You have no personal knowledge_**?

 |
| 

Ms Eng

 | 

**_I have no personal knowledge_** and that it was why I offered to give you the information for your IO to investigate because as I said, I have given the information, it is really up to the IO to look into it and it’s really not for me to say or suggest, and so that’s why I said I have this information, if you want it and you find that it’s important please go ahead and use it.

 |

  
  

299    Ms Eng added that she had a degree was in psychology and professed an interest in interacting and speaking with students. She had studied sexual crimes as an undergraduate and had been taught to look into “_typical behaviour, exhibition of behaviours that show signs of distress in relation to various… trauma_”[^295] Ms Eng was clear that she had not had any actual personal contact with students who had been sexually abused, but understood that students who were sexually abused, _“exhibited very extreme behaviour like self-harm_” tendencies. She had learnt of these cases from “_the person who_ (sat) n_ext to_ (her)” at the office who had been a head of department for counselling where she worked. She had thus expected persons who had been sexually assaulted to have flashbacks, exhibit self-harm behaviours, be poor in studies and, have difficulty trying to put their lives together. She had been aware of four cases, all having exhibited the same signs, which she found to be “_congruent_” with what she had “_studied thus far_”. [^296]

300    I was surprised by Ms Eng’s improbably broad-brush characterisation which carried an expectation that victims of sex assault would invariably exhibit extreme behaviour, self-harm, and social dysfunction, and that Ms C’s subsequent activity of cheerleading was consequently sufficiently anomalous as to have merited investigation of the truth of her allegations. Ultimately Ms Eng’s basis appeared to be four **_anecdotal_** accounts related to her by a colleague who had sat next to her at her university office. She conceded that she was not a clinical psychologist, but this had not stopped her from offering her specious views to both the investigation officer and the court, via her testimony. I noted that Ms Eng had not even taken the trouble to find any academic basis (such as from authoritative textbooks and reputable journals on Psychiatry and/or Psychology) for her idiosyncratic views on how a sexual assault victim was expected to behave. Ms Eng remained insistent that her sampling of four was a valid representative sample to justify her views, as she had “_personal information_” of the four cases related to her by her colleague:

>   
| 

DPP:

 | 

And I suggest to you that you are exaggerating your expertise at this Court.

 |
| 

Ms Eng

 | 

I am not, I said 4 cases. I did not say all or many cases. **_4 cases I can even name you who, which level they are and so on because I have personal information about them_**.

 |

  
  

301    To address the point that Ms Eng had sought to make, I would point to the case of _Public Prosecutor v Yue Roger Jr_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 749</span>; <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 125</span> (_Yue Roger_), where Aedit Abdullah J had held at \[34\]:

> 34     **_Similarly, the fact that the Victim was not driven into despair or helplessness was not by itself a ground for disbelief of her evidence. People react in different ways to sexual abuse and may compartmentalise or rationalise their reactions._** A calm, undisturbed disposition may generally incline the court to conclude that no wrong was committed, but it is not necessary for a complainant to be distraught for her to be believed.

302    I should add that Ms C’s disposition over the course of the five-and-a-half days where she was cross-examined was certainly far from calm and undisturbed in parts, with her responses attracting adverse observations and submissions from the defence, for her reactions at certain junctures of her testimony where her emotions appeared to have got the better of her. _Yue Roger_ involved a rope-skipping coach who had faced 48 charges, including multiple counts of sexual penetration of the young complainant, from 2008 to 2010, when she was the offender’s trainee. There are some parallels with the instant case, and I will cover other salient aspects of that case later in these grounds.

303    I also found it peculiar that Ms Eng, who had known Ms C from her Secondary school days, and had introduced her to Mr Loh, had despite her trenchant views, been unable to articulate any motive that Ms C might have had to frame Mr Loh[^297], preferring not to commit herself either way.

>   
| 

DPP

 | 

And you’re saying all this now because you’re really finding reasons for (Ms C’s) allegation to be untrue.

 |
| 

Ms Eng

 | 

No, I’m just sharing what I know.

 |
| 

DPP

 | 

When deep down inside in fact, you know, **_there is no grudge between them_**, right? Between (Ms C) and Mr. Loh.

 |
| 

Ms Eng

 | 

**_I really don’t know about that_**.

 |
| 

DPP:

 | 

And this really---**_you agree with me there’s really no reason for her to lie_**?

 |
| 

Ms Eng

 | 

**_I don’t know about that either._**

 |
| 

\[Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

### DW5’s initial supportive position as expressed in her WhatsApp messages on 2 June 2016

304    Ms Eng’s position in court, where she had seemingly developed a fixation that Ms C was not behaving like a ‘real’ victim of a sexual assault marked a sea change from her initial response, which projected alarm, sympathy and reassurance. This can be seen from salient fragments of the email chain on 2 June 2016, which begins with Ms C’s revelation that she was sexually assaulted:

>   
| 

Ms C:

 | 

Hi ms eng, can I be rily honest w you. Rmb last time I told you mr Low massaged me and made me uncomfortable, I didn’t rily tell you what exactly happened. He kinda made me train individually with him on three occasions and kept massaging me further and further up my thighs, in this equipment room behind the spectator stands and eventually he rubbed me down there. And I was scared and I didn’t know what to do and I said stop but he just told me to relax. And I tried closing my thighs tight but he kept rubbing me until I came and I didn’t know what an orgasm was and how wrong it was until (Mr A) tried explaining to me and told me to quit. I think I just spent rily long crying and feeling very dirty but when I tried to explain to you that time I didn’t dare say it. I told (Ms W) what had happened and she told me he did the same to me too when she continued training with him after graduating from (_name of school_) but she just tried to forget about it. That’s kinda why I stopped running and she stopped training under him, I’m scared you’ll send the juniors to train under him when they graduate so just letting you know. (time: 15.52)

 |
| 

Ms Eng:

 | 

Thanks for telling me (Ms C)**_. Must have taken you a lot to tell me this._** (time 15.59)

Now it is actually (male student) who is training with him and **_I’m more careful to only send boys and only if necessary._** (time: 16:00)

**I am so sorry that I put you through this!!!** (_emoticons bearing a saddened expression_, time 16:06)

Did he remove any clothing? And also what happened after he did it? (time 16.07)

Did he ask any questions also?

Which stadium is this?

I thought usually he’s packed with training sessions, **_so I didn’t expect him to be able to get you alone_**. :(time 16:09)

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

Cos I shared it w a few of my friends ytd and when you came, I realised the juniors were rlly good and you might send them to him. (time: 16.09)

I didn’t wna tell you ‘cos I know how much you respect him. (time: 16.09)

I treated him like a dad too. (time: 16.09)

And no it’s rlly not your fault at all! (time: 16.10)

He was good at track but maybe not so much as a person. (time: 16.10)

I didn’t remove anything, I was wearing tights. (time: 16.10)

 |
| 

Ms Eng:

 | 

**_I am so sorry_**. (time: 16.10)

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

The first time he massaged my calves, the second time my upper thighs and the third time it went there. (time: 16.10)

 |
| 

Ms Eng:

 | 

Nah… **_I didn’t send anyone to him cos after you mentioned, to be safe, I didn’t want to._** (time: 16.11)

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

And I didn’t know I was orgasmingg so my body kept moving and it was so weird and I tried to hold everything in until he stopped. (time: 16.11)

We both acted like nth happened and he took me to dinner (time: 16.11)

 |
| 

Ms Eng:

 | 

He actually touched you directly there? (time: 16.11)

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

Yeah (time: 16.11)

 |
| 

Ms Eng:

 | 

What was he doing? (time: 16.11)

 |
| 

Ms C :

 | 

But with my tights on (time : 16.11)

Just rubbing (time: 16.11)

Rlly hard (time: 16.11)

Tampines stadium (time: 16.11)

March 2013 (time: 16.11)

It happens on Sunday’s (time: 16.11)

 |
| 

Ms Eng

 | 

As for him. **_Was he looking like he enjoyed it? Or you didn’t dare look at him_**? (time: 16.11)

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

It’s the day we usually don’t train (time: 16.12)

So I was quite surprised he wanted to train me individually on a Sunday. (time: 16.12)

 |
| 

Ms Eng:

 | 

**_That’s a bad sign. One on one shld be no. Oh no_**. (time: 16.12)

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

I was lying face down (time: 16.13)

I didn’t see him. (time: 16.13)

(Ms W) did though, she just pushed it aside (time: 16.13)

I didn’t know the one on one thing (time: 16.13)

That’s why I took (university) as the excuse to stop training and (Mr B) made me stop picking up his calls and break contact. (time: 16.14)

 |
| 

Ms Eng:

 | 

So after the third time when he touched up there, you stopped coming to train? (time: 16.14)

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

I still went (time: 16.14)

 |
| 

Ms Eng:

 | 

Or you continued but in a group (time: 16.14)

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

But only as a group in bishan, (time: 16.14)

 |
| 

Ms Eng:

 | 

And everything was normal (time: 16.15)

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

Yeah (time: 16.15)

 |
| 

(_the discussion next turns to Ms W’s alleged sex assault, and also Ms C’s concern for female trainees, Ms Eng indicates she was never sexually assaulted_)

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

Maybe y’all were grown up and not as naïve as I was. (time: 16.20)

Like at that moment rlly dk what to do (time: 16.20)

 |
| 

Ms Eng:

 | 

**_Argh Really sorry_** (Ms C) (time: 16.20)

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

It’s okay I rlly don’t blame you at all. (time: 16.20)

Just telling you in case more girls go there (time: 16.20)

 |
| 

Ms Eng:

 | 

**_But I am really sad and sorry that it happened to you_** (time: 16.20)

**_Especially when you have no idea what’s going on_** (time: 16.20)

**_And cause you feelings of shame_** (time: 16.21)

**_It could have been a lot worse_** (time: 16.21)

**_The feeling dirty thing is really awful_** (time: 16.21)

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

It was quite bad (time: 16.21)

But it’s been three years so (time: 16.21)

 |
| 

Ms Eng

 | 

I mean it could have stopped you from trusting another guy (time: 16.21)

And being intimate with another man who cld be your life partner (time: 16.22)

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

It did a bit (time: 16.22)

**_Now it just makes me wna chop off his d\*\*\*\* and help prostitutes and stop rape when I grow up or smth heh_** (time: 16.23)

 |
| 

Ms Eng

 | 

**_im so so sorry_** (sad emoticon) (time: 16.25)

**_I know it’s not going to change anything but. man_**. (time: 16.25)

**_Well i guess the only thing now is to help the other kids._** (time: 16.25)

So the twins who were from (Ms C’s) batch seemed to have resumed training with him, **_I’m not sure though of he would do anything to them_** since it seems like both twins have gone back (time: 16.26)

…

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

It’s okay, it’s his fault for being a pervert (time: 16.33)

I just texted (Ms W) (time: 16.33)

At one point in time she also didn’t know whether to change her poly coach or stick with hi(m) (time: 16.33)

But she was scared he’d ask for indiv trngs and she won’t know how to say no so she switched to her poly coach instead (time: 16.34)

 |
| 

Ms Eng

 | 

**_oh i see_** (time: 16.56)

**_Sigh, but thanks_** (Ms C), **_must be crazy for you to even tell me, thank you_** (time: 16.56)

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

haha a bit, I had to ask (Mr A) to help me look thru my message first hahahaha, I kinda accepted it, cos it’s been so long, but just rlly didn’t want the juniors to experience the same thing (time: 17.11)

 |
| 

Ms Eng

 | 

**_ok. sniff. thanks dear_** (time: 17.11)

 |
| 

Ms C:

Haha (Mr A) is very much gay (time: 17.16)

Not confused at all (time: 17.16)

Going to Finland for six mth exchange (time: 17.16)

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

Yeah (time: 17.20)

### Why this WhatsApp chain is especially significant

305    The reproduction of this thread above has been done with a view of setting out the full context of Ms Eng’s responses in juxtaposition with Ms C's revelations. This exchange is especially cogent as it is the singular set of _WhatsApp_ communications which documents messages between the putative victim and a witness who had, by the time of trial at least, unequivocally associated herself with the **_defence_** case. There would thus be no question of the **_authenticity_** of the chain of messages; that they were unimpeachable as spontaneous communications. The involvement of Ms Eng in the chain would obviate any possibility of the messages having been ‘manufactured’ as a contrivance by the complainants and sympathetic confederates to build a case against Mr Loh. This being so, I was impressed by the consistency of Ms C’s description of the alleged sexual assaults. The plaintive tone of her recollection had a ring of authenticity of a person who had experienced, and was still impacted by, a set of traumatic experiences. The timing between her flurry of messages showed no hesitation in recall nor any discrepancy of significance from the 2013 messages between her and Ms W, and later; Mr A. Ms C seemed extremely eager to unburden herself to a person she had then regarded as a confidant, and a sympathetic ear.

306    Ms C’s concern for young female athletes following in her path, evidenced by her multiple references that they not be sent to train with Mr Loh, also struck me as genuine, as was her frequent entreaties to Ms Eng not to blame herself, in the face of Ms Eng’s profuse apologies ( e.g. “_I am so so sorry_.” and “_But I am really sad and sorry that it happened to you_**_”_****)** for placing Ms C in the situation. Ms C was extremely forthright, to the point of telling Ms Eng that she had asked Mr A to help her draft her initial long message[^298] which revealed the sexual assaults. The fact that Ms C’s disclosure of Mr A’s involvement was **_unremarked_** by Ms Eng did give credence to Ms C’s claim that Mr A had also been involved in **_2013_** sounding out to Ms Eng that she (Ms C) had something to tell her. In the text too, Ms Eng seemed to **_acknowledge_** that she received prior information about Mr Loh from Ms C before the date of the chain of _WhatsApp_ messages (“_I’m more careful to only send boys and only if necessary_”[^299] and “_Nah… I didn’t send anyone to him cos after you mentioned, to be safe, I didn’t want to_.”[^300]) By the time she gave her court testimony, Ms Eng had become rather vague about when she had been told of Ms C’s discomfiture with Mr Loh’s massages (“_I can't recall whether she told me about Mr Loh during that meet_…”)[^301]

### PW5’s critique that complainant’s trauma was “not as serious as she made it out to be”

307    The sea change of Ms Eng’s impression of Ms C, from that of a person whom she had unwittingly victimised to becoming an accuser with dubious motivations was glaringly evident in her testimony where Ms Eng had criticised Ms C for her intemperate reference to “_want_” to visit an act of bodily harm to Mr Loh [^302] and also in Ms C telling her that she had gone for a swim towards the end of their _WhatsApp_ chat, which she viewed as evidence that the trauma was “_not as serious as she made it out to be_”:

> …(T)**_he message that calls for concern to me was when she said “Now, it just makes me want to chop off his d\*\*\*\* and help prostitutes and stop rape, when I grow up or something_**” And, um, she ended with a “heh”, so, uh, I was a bit puzzled by that comment because at that point of time she was already an adult. So, um, what does it mean by “when I grow up”? And, um, prostitutes are a choice, I guess, and what does she mean that she wants to help and the wants to stop? **_And the very serious note about wanting to chop off his d\*\*\* and ended with a “heh” sounded very conflicting_**, so, um---and---um, I mean---then she continued to say that she did contact (Ms W) and, uh, it was a very intense conversation **_I felt from the time when she texted me at about 4:10 all the way until 4:30 and, um, and then, she ended off with letting me know that she went for swim within the 20 minutes of explaining to me how it was so traumatising for her, so, it sounded again very, um, not as serious as she made it out to be_** and so, that was that…

308    Upon a close examination of the WhatsApp exchanges, it became evident that Ms Eng’s position that Ms C’s messages gave “_calls for concern_” and that she was not as traumatised “_as she made it out to be_” were somewhat misconceived, as her expounded views could have arisen from premises where the two text messages had been taken out of their proper context. In particular, they are at odds with the fact that in both instances, Ms C’s responses were in fact largely set up by prior remarks or observations by Ms Eng herself.

309    For the first instance, Ms Eng had begun with two messages of commiseration “_But I am really sad and sorry that it happened to you_”, “_Especially when you have no idea what’s going on_”. She had then gone on to state rather tactlessly (if comforting Ms C had been her aim) to text “_And cause you feelings of_ **_shame_**” before likely escalating Ms C’s emotional state with her ominous fourth message: “It could have **_been a lot worse_**,” and topping that with “_The_ **_feeling dirty_** _thing is really awful_”.[^303]

310    Ms C had commented that “_It was quite bad_” with a moderating comment that “_But it’s been three years so_”. Ms Eng had however piled on with two messages that Ms C would be permanently stultified from trusting men or being intimate in her future relationships stating, “_I mean it could have stopped you from trusting another guy_” and “_And being intimate with another man who cld be your life partner_”. Ms C had confirmed that there had been such a residual psychological effect “_It did a bit_” before launching the remark which Ms Eng complained of.

311    In my view, Ms C’s reference to her imagined castration of the accused in the context of Ms Eng’s preceding comments, while intemperate, seemed more a cathartic expression of suppressed anger than any sign that she suffered from any mental or psychological condition meriting “_calls for concern_”

312    The second instance had been where Ms Eng had flagged Ms C’s reference to having gone for a swim as evidence that she had not been severely affected. This had occurred towards the tail end of the chat, where Ms Eng had commended Ms C for her gumption to speak up, telling her that it “_must be crazy for you to even tell me, thank you_”. She had seemingly signed off from the substantive discussion about Mr Loh with an “_ok. sniff. thanks dear_”. Ms C had reciprocated with a heart emoticon before Ms Eng signalled that they should “**_okay. Change topic, make you feel less”_** with a punctuation mark emoticon of a wink and wry smile expression: (**; S)**. Ms Eng had then started a light-hearted banter about Mr A and his sexual identity inquiring if he was “_Still confused?_”.

313    The context therefore was that Ms C had only messaged “_hahaha I just went for a swim :)_” after Ms Eng had effectively called a time-out to their discussion on Mr Loh with an “_okay_” and an invitation to “_Change topic_”, for the express reason of making her “_feel less_” Ms Eng had added seemed to be encouraging some levity by inquiring playfully whether Mr A was “_still confused_”, suggesting that Mr A’s sexual identity was previously a familiar shared topic and the slant of Ms Eng’s question seemed to be a friendly if somewhat sardonic or “snarky” inquiry which invited a friendly and socially congruent response. Ms C had updated Ms Eng accordingly about Mr A, as well as the fact that she had just gone for a swim.

314    Ms Eng’s response of finding this response abnormal just because Ms C told her of that she had gone for a swim “_within the 20 minutes of explaining to_ (Ms Eng) _how it was so traumatising for her_ (Ms C)” was, in my view, somewhat off the mark, given that she herself had initiated the topic change in consideration of helping Ms C “_feel less_” and especially as more than three years had passed between the alleged sexual assaults and the time of the _WhatsApp_ chat.

### Application to impeach credit of DW5

315    Citing various aspects of her testimony which were discrepant with her police statement, the prosecution has called for Ms Eng’s testimony to be impeached pursuant to section 157(c) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, Rev Ed 1997), which allows for impeachment by proof of former statements inconsistent with any part of a witness’ evidence which is liable to be contradicted. DPP Gail Wong made it clear that the prosecution merely sought to impeach Ms Eng’s credit and did not seek the substitution of the statement in place of her court testimony.

### The five areas of material discrepancy asserted by the prosecution

316    The learned DPP identified five areas where she had asserted material discrepancies between Ms Eng’s statement and her court testimony.

> (1)    The statement, which encompassed communications with Ms C until 2015, did **_not_** reference the father meeting Mr Loh in a training session, an event mentioned in her court testimony where a visit in early January 2013 was averred to[^304]:

>   
| 

Counsel:

 | 

… (Y)ou mentioned about the father visiting---

 |
| 

Ms Eng

 | 

Yah.

 |
| 

Counsel:

 | 

and (Ms C) mentioned to you about father visiting and spoken to Mr. Loh.

 |
| 

Ms Eng

 | 

Yah.

 |
| 

Counsel

 | 

Was it---are you able to recall whether it’s before this message on the 5th Jan 2013 or is it after?

 |
| 

Ms Eng

 | 

It should be after.

 |

  
  

> (2)    At \[5\] of Ms Eng’s statement, she had reported that Ms C had told her that Mr. Loh had touched her inappropriately:

>> (In 2015) I met her in the school. We talk about her studies and her relationship issues. I can't recall whether she told me about Mr Loh during that meet up but I remember that she did mention about the incident with Mr Loh when I met her in June for another retreat in (_a local university_). She told me that she quit training because she was not comfortable with Mr Loh. **_She claimed that Mr Loh had touched her inappropriately…_**

>> **_… I thought Mr Loh might have also massaged her similarly and she was not comfortable with it._** I asked her what she means by uncomfortable and she mentioned that Mr Loh had massaged her but did not tell me what happened during the massage. I did not ask her further as she didn’t seem like she wanted to elaborate.

> Ms. Eng had in her court testimony made no mention about any massage or other inappropriate contact[^305]:

>   
| 

Counsel:

 | 

P)rior to the 2nd of June 2016 text which is in P3-42…

(Ms C) never mentioned anything negative about Mr. Loh?

 |
| 

Ms Eng:

 | 

Uh, she mentioned in 2015.

 |
| 

Counsel

 | 

And what was that about?

 |
| 

Ms Eng

 | 

She mentioned …she was not comfortable.

 |
| 

Counsel

 | 

Not comfortable with what?

 |
| 

Ms Eng

 | 

**_She was not comfortable_** trai---**_continuing training with Mr. Loh._**

 |
| 

Counsel

 | 

**_And aside from that? Anything else?_**

 |
| 

Ms Eng

 | 

**_No._**

 |
| 

Counsel

 | 

**_Did she say that she had a massage from Mr. Loh?_**

 |
| 

Ms Eng

 | 

**_No._**

 |
| 

Counsel

 | 

Could she have mentioned this but you were not paying attention?

 |
| 

Ms Eng

 | 

It’s unlikely, 2015, it was just me and her.

 |

  
  

> (3)    Ms Eng had next alluded to there being more images than the ones exhibited as P28. Ms Eng had handed her mobile phone to the investigation officer and had expected the police cyber-tech unit to extract all the chats which dated from 2013. Despite signing to acknowledge as authentic the 13 images of _WhatsApp_ chats between her and Ms C (which were reproduced in part in the preceding passages in these grounds), she contended that there should have been more than the 13 pages she signed. In court her position was expressed to be “_These_ (13 pages_) were the messages but there were some more_”.[^306]

> (4)    Ms Eng had acknowledged Mr Loh to be her mentor declaring that “_He is my mentor and is like a grandfather figure to the younger kids I had seen_”[^307]. Ms Eng had added some distance to her relationship during her testimony to : “_He was_ **_my coach, not my mentor_**_. I have had, uh_, **_many coaches_** _during my time in track_.“[^308]. She had also retracted the previous appellation she had granted of Mr Loh being a “_grandfather figure_” to the younger kids, stating “_Because as far as I’m concerned, IJ Toa Payoh kids are not my kids, so, I wouldn’t know how they felt about him_.” [^309]

> (5)    The fifth area was the apparent variance in Ms Eng’s reasons for not confronting Mr. Loh. In her statement she had asserted that “_I did not question or tell Mr Loh about this as I find it_ **_strange and awkward_**”[^310]. This had morphed to her finding “_too many loopholes_”[^311]in Ms C’s account.

>   
| 

DPP:

 | 

Now, is it true that you didn't ask Mr. Loh on the allegations because you found it **_strange_** to do so and **_awkward_** to do so?

 |
| 

Ms Eng:

 | 

No, not true. I didn't ask him because I felt that there were **_too many loopholes_**.

 |

  
  

### Analysis on impeachment application

317    In relation to the five areas identified, I indicated to the prosecution that the third, which involved Ms Eng’s claim that her phone when produced to the SI Alan Khor had additional messages between herself and Ms C, was neither here nor there[^312], as Ms Eng’s evidence was that the phone had irreparably “_crashed_”[^313] apparently while in her possession. This was thus a dead end, offering nothing that either the defence or prosecution could usefully assert. The fact remained that the witness had signed on the 13 pages of photographs[^314] of _WhatsApp_ chats, and not made any contemporaneous comment of there being any other content in her phone which would be helpful to the investigation, in her statement. The other four were material discrepancies which merited further inquiry.

318    The most significant difference among the four identified sets of discrepancies I held to be material, was Ms Eng’s assertion at her evidence- in-chief that Ms C’s father had met Mr Loh during a group training session in January 2013, which was missing in her statement. Ms Eng’s attention was directed to the parts of her statement underlined by the learned DPP. The witness’ initial position that her not mentioning the meeting between Mr Loh and Ms C was **_not_** an omission[^315] as the investigation officer had failed to specifically ask her about that. She then adjusted her position that it was “_not an intentional omission_”[^316], even as she conceded that the investigation officer had allowed her full reign to state all salient facts as the statement was “recorded in a free-flowing narrative form”. Ms Eng disagreed with the DPP’s suggestion that she “_did not do so_ (i.e., refer to the meeting between the two men) _because no such conversation took place_”.

### The discrepancy between Ms Eng’s omission of the meeting between complainant’s father and the accused in her statement, and her subsequent testimony of the father’s attendance at a group training January 2013 was an attempt to dovetail her evidence with the accused’s testimony

319    I did not accept that the omission of any reference the meeting between Mr Loh and Mr F in Ms Eng’s statement on 14 October 2016, and the inclusion of such a detail in May 2019 was a mere oversight. Mr Loh himself had, during the recording of his own statement on 2 August 2016, **_wavered_** in this detail stating “_Except (Ms C) when the father was there I cannot remember whether I train her alone or with someone else…”[^317]._ He seemed somewhat uncertain at the time and was, in my view, contemplating whether he should admit to having conducted an individual training session with Ms C on that occasion. He would have weighed the fact that the father had witnessed the training event and could be expected to testify about the encounter, and thus recognised the futility of denying having met Mr F at a training session.

320    Mr Loh had later, at trial, taken the line that if Ms C’s father had come to any training session, this would have been a **_group_** session, giving his various reasons why Mr F might not have seen the other athletes at Tampines Stadium that rainy day. I believed that the defence had contrived to shift the date from the prosecution’s case of the meeting between the men occurring on 10 **_March_** 2013 to “_early_ **_January_** _2013_” to aid their case. This adjustment would disrupt the prosecution’s case which was, of course, predicated on the alleged criminal acts at individual training sessions occurring in a particular sequence with a space of one week to five days between these sessions, and with the meeting between Ms Loh and Mr F **_straddling_** the second and fourth final sessions, where the two alleged acts of molestation had taken place.

321    Ms Eng admitted that she had accompanied Mr Loh to his lawyer’s office on at least two occasions; in January 2018[^318] before the prosecution opened its case against Mr Loh, and in October 2016[^319]. Although Ms Eng could not recall the exact dates and thus could not confirm if the latter had occurred before or during 14 October 2016, she confirmed that her purpose was “_to give him support_”[^320]. It thus appeared likely that Ms Eng would be aware of the significance of Mr F’s attendance at the training session to the factual matrix of this case, and particularly to Mr Loh’s defence of alibi. Hence her failure to mention this when she recorded the statement, and her subsequent placing of that training session in early January 2013 seems to be an attempt to **_align_** her court testimony to Mr Loh’s own evidence.

### DW5’s explanation for other identified discrepancies

322    Ms C attributed the difference in her account between what Ms C had told her in her statement and in her court testimony to memory frailty, given that she had given her statement in 2016 and her testimony was in 2019. She conceded that the statement, with the reference to having been touched inappropriately, would have been the more complete account. Ms Eng, however insisted that Ms C’s first revelation of her being uncomfortable and being inappropriately touched had been in 2015, just a year before she had given her statement. Strangely, Ms Eng identified **_two_** events that year where she had met Ms C at a local university, and in her statement indicated “_I can’t recall whether_ (Ms C) _told me about Mr. Loh during that_ (initial) _meetup but I remember that she did mention about the incident with Mr. Loh when I met her in June for another retreat at_ (the local university).” Ms Eng did not shed any further light on her inability to recall what had been discussed at the earlier occasion in 2016. Conceding that the timing she had given in the statement seemed unclear, she added that she had visited the university and met Ms C twice, and on both occasions had left the university grounds together “_with each other and just one on one_” allowing for a more intimate chat. The two occasions were “_about six months apart_”. Ms Eng finally conceded that “_I cannot really remember whether she told then in 2015 or 2016_ (that) _she was uncomfortable about being touched inappropriately”_.[^321]

323    In any case, Ms Eng’s placing of the initial revelation in 2015 or 2016 differed from the prosecution’s case that Ms Eng had been told by Ms C in 2013. Of that Ms Eng was vehement that “_I remember 2013, she didn’t tell me anything_…”[^322] explaining that she had broken her wrist that year, and her meeting had been in a “very crowded place” with milling students all over, rendering it “_impossible for us to have a conversation in private with her telling me about the incident_(s)”.[^323] She had been concerned that she would be knocked into by persons in close proximity and was thus concluded that “_I think it’s very unlikely that I would have had the conversation with her in 2013_”.

324    My observation is that while Ms Eng was able to show a photographic image of her with nursing an injured arm in 2013, the image would not have the same **_probative_** connection in backing her account as Ms A and Ms C’s _WhatsApp_ messages in end-March 2013, where Mr A had reiterated his intent to inform Ms Eng that Ms C had something to tell her, and also that he had given a further reminder to Ms C tell Ms Eng several hours after the initial set of messages. This was supported by Ms A’s subsequent testimony that he had indeed conveyed the message to Ms Eng that Ms C had something to tell her.

325    Ms Eng went on to explain that her personal and professional relationship with Mr Loh had changed, and thus while she had regarded him as a mentor in 2016 as a neophyte coach in 2016, her coaching credentials had strengthened in the intervening period. Having become an experienced coach herself, Mr Loh was, in her eyes, more of a fellow coach in 2019, than a mentor.

326    On the final area identified as a discrepancy by the prosecution, Ms Eng had initially stated that she had not questioned or even told Mr. Loh of Ms C’s complaint as she would “_find it strange and awkward to do so_”, but this had morphed into Ms Eng finding it unnecessary to ask Mr Loh as she had found “_too many loopholes_” with Ms C’s account. Insisting that she had always harboured suspicions, Ms Eng gave a somewhat convoluted response[^324]:

> Ms Eng:    2016 when I was first called up, since the time when (Ms C) told me about the case, um, at that point in time I … I did not---or **_have not actually take any sides and I still am not taking any sides_**. I’m stating facts as it is, and to say that I did not question or tell Mr. Loh because I found it strange and awkward at that point in time, it’s because when the IO asked me, whether … I thought it was a conspiracy theory, **_I told him that it was up to him to investigate and strange and awkward because there are so many strange_** … **_circumstances surrounding this_** and it was awkward because if I have no facts, no proof, how am I going to tell Mr. Loh, “Did you do this?” The word strange came from the fact that there were many loopholes, I may not have used the word loopholes at that point in time because I told the IO that it is for him to investigate.

> \[Emphasis added\]

327    With respect, Ms Eng’s latter two explanations seemed to be backpedalling in the first instance to make her seem less beholden to Mr Loh, and an attempt at _after-the-fact_ justification in the second instance to explain her inaction by stating that she had already harboured suspicions about “_loopholes_” (which I took to mean perceived unaccounted gaps) in Ms C’s account. It seemed rather strange that Ms Eng claimed to be “_too overwhelmed_”[^325] after receiving Ms C’s messages to clarify with Mr Loh, given the profound doubts she had claimed to harbour upon finding “_loopholes_” in Ms C’s account.

### Whether DW5’s failure to act on complainant’s revelation had implications on her credit

328    Ultimately, there were irreconcilable aspects of Ms Eng’s evidence. Her **_inaction_** in the light of Ms C’s revelations were discordant with her (Ms Eng’s) responses in the _WhatsApp_, where she had both evinced concern for Ms C’s reported trauma, and of the need to safeguard present and future batches of students from having to undergo a similar experience. Assuming that her effusive and supportive responses were sincere, it was puzzling that she had done **_nothing_** at all, up to the time of Ms C’s police report some two months later. This was broached by the learned DPP, leading to the following exchange at cross-examination[^326]:

>   
| 

DPP

 | 

Now, after (Ms C) has told you this on the 2nd of June 2016… you would agree with me, it would be natural to follow up with her, to check in on how she was?

 |
| 

Ms Eng

 | 

It appears from the messages, at the end, that she was pretty fine and, hence, I didn't feel like there was a need to follow up with her.

 |
| 

DPP

 | 

**_So, from 2nd of June 2016 to 31st of July 2016, you never asked her how she was_**?

 |
| 

Ms Eng

 | 

**_No._**

 |
| 

DPP

 | 

**_Would you agree with me that it would be strange as a concerned teacher not to ask?_**

 |
| 

Ms Eng

 | 

**_Generally, I don’t keep in touch with my students unless they reach out to me and this is applicable to all students. Whether I have had a close relationship in school or not_**.

 |
| 

DPP

 | 

Really? But in D2, you told (Ms C), “Hello (Ms C). How’s training coming along?”

 |
| 

Ms Eng

 | 

That was when she just graduated. This was 2016 which was 3 years along. She had already broken off contact with me for quite a while.

 |
| 

DPP

 | 

**_Now, whether or not the allegations are true, as a teacher, did you take any actions based on what she had said_**?

 |
| 

Ms Eng

 | 

**_No._**

 |
| 

DPP

 | 

**_As a teacher, if someone would talk---were to come to you with these allegations, what would you do?_**

 |
| 

Ms Eng

 | 

**_If the child is under my duty of care, I will then inform her parents._**

 |
| 

DPP

 | 

But her concern was really about sending other girls to Mr. Loh, wasn’t it?

 |
| 

Ms Eng

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

DPP:

 | 

And you didn't do anything?

 |
| 

Ms Eng

 | 

I did not send anymore girls to him.

 |
| 

\[Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

329    Ms Eng sought to explain that there was no longer any need to send more promising athletes from their school to Mr Loh as the school had, by 2016, found a competent in-house coach to groom their emerging talents. This did not address the situation of private trainees or students from other schools who had looked to Mr Loh for their training needs. Ms Eng would have learnt from the _WhatsApp_ chat alone that Mr Loh had allegedly molested **_two_** trainees; Ms C and Ms W. Even confronting Mr Loh, without going to the police (which had been Ms C and Mr A’s stated plan), would have, at the very least, been a protective measure for his extant trainees. This being so as any individual suspected of having committed outrages of modesty would have likely been deterred from **_further_** acts of molestation, if he were aware of the existence of complaints, and hence likely scrutiny, on his activities.

330    The fact that Ms Eng, the **_only_** adult authority figure approached by Ms C, did nothing, despite the strong sentiments she herself had espoused in the chat, suggested that Ms Eng had already made up her mind **_not_** to report, and had likely been surprised by Ms C actually filing the police report on Saturday, 30 July 2013. Her subsequent accompaniment of Mr Loh to his lawyers’ office, and offers to proffer an image of Ms C, engaged in a cheerleading activity, to the investigation to demonstrate that Ms C did not behave like “_a real victim_” did place in doubt her assertion of “_not taking any sides_”.

### Ruling on prosecution’s application to impeach DW5’s credit

331    Considering the foregoing, I was of the view that the prosecution’s call for Ms Eng to be impeached as a witness was appropriate and ruled accordingly.

## EVALUATING THE RESPECTIVE CASES.

### Complete failure of the defence of alibi

332    For the three dates, the defence was unable to establish their alibi defence: on a balance of probabilities. To briefly recapitulate with regard to the three dates:

> For **24 February 2013**.[^327] (_which the prosecution had identified as the date for the second training session_)

> (i)     There had been no documentary proof that Mr Loh had undertaken the activities claimed, which included his marketing with his wife for prayer offerings, setting the table and entertaining his relatives that day, which was _Chap Goh Mei_, the fifteenth day of the Lunar New Year.

> (ii)     The accused’s brother; Mr Loh Sian Kok, had presented as “proof” of his attending at the _Chap Goh Mei_ dinner, his borrowing of a jacket to attend an event in Boston to receive an award which would be presented to his wife. Mr Loh Sian Kok’s principal instrument of this proof was a letter from his wife’s employer; Liberty Mutual Insurance corporation, announcing the conferment of the award. The letter was, however, dated **_11 March 2013_**, which was 15 days **_after_** 24 February 2013. The letter indicated that detailed arrangements for the presentation event would follow (“_Under separate cover, you will receive details concerning the award presentation and celebration activities scheduled in Boston from May 9th to May 11th 2013_”), this revealing the letter to apparently be the **_first_** notification that the award would be conferred.

> (iii)     The accused’s wife had no distinct recollection of that day, and merely recounted what they would usually do when _Chap Goh Mei_ fell on a Sunday. She could not show that Mr Loh never left the apartment for that day. Mr Loh lived in Pasir Ris, which was just one MRT stop from the central part of Tampines town, where Tampines Stadium was situated. There was no basis to disagree with the DPP’s submission that the wife was testifying from _“muscle memory_” of the family’s routine from years past.

> For 10 March 2013 (_where the prosecution contends that the third training session had taken place in the afternoon with the complainant’s father in attendance)_

> (i)     Mr Loh had been conspicuously present at the _Venus Run_ in the morning, with his attendance documented by a number of photographic images taken and exhibited at the organiser’s website. Defence witnesses Ms Jaya and Ms Michelle Eng had also attended that event, which was to celebrate International Women’s Day, and where the Singapore Athletic Association provided organisational support.

> (ii)     There was, however, no documentation of his presence at the _Akira Swift 60th Anniversary Track and Field Championship 2013_ held in the **_afternoon_** of 10 March 2013.Mr Loh’s reason for attending the event, which was organised by the Singapore Athletic Association was conflicting. Mr Loh had wanted to look into their organisational deficiencies and criticised their parsimony in engaging unqualified officials to save money, but had also wished to collaborate with their “_high-performance side_”.

> (iii)     Mr Loh and his witness; Club Zoom president; Mr Tan Wei Leong, had occupied a conspicuous part of the Toa Payoh Stadium where athletes reported for their events, but neither could name a single athlete who would have seen them that afternoon.

> (iv)     The two men had given different timings for when they left Toa Payoh Stadium, to share a meal and chat in an eatery in Toa Payoh. Most significantly, neither had seemed aware of a spell of rain in the late afternoon to early evening of 10 March 2013. The meteorological records obtained by the prosecution showed that it had rained around the precincts of both Tampines Stadium and Toa Payoh Stadium that late afternoon. Given that the rain fell for a full 80 minutes, it seemed unlikely that the phenomenon would have been missed had both men actually been in Toa Payoh Stadium, or its immediate environs that day.

> For **15 March 2013** (_which was identified by the prosecution as the final individual training session_)

> (i)      _Alibi_ Witness Terry Tan claimed to have been asked to wait for Mr Loh outside Bishan Stadium until **_past 6.00pm_** on 15 March 2013. Mr Tan’s ostensible reason had been to discuss an emergent problem between two competing tug-of-war federations. The reason for Mr Tan to drive over to pick up Mr Loh at Bishan Stadium for a two-man personal discussion did not appear to be rational, as both men lived close to each other in the East of Singapore; Mr Tan in government quarters in Tanah Merah and Mr Loh in Pasir Ris. Other than the puzzlingly circuitous trip by Mr Tan to meet Mr Loh, it would have been a valid question why the two men had not simply discussed by phone or text messaging, as the discussion, as revealed by the testimonial evidence, did not seem to involve anything of particular complexity, with Mr Loh’s solution simply being to advise Mr Tan to formally seek the opinion of Sports SG.

> (ii)     Mr Loh also claimed to have had an ordinary training session on 15 March 2013 with the **_full_** track team of Bishan Stadium. His other two _alibi_ witnesses; Ms Amirah Aljunied and Ms Jaya however differed from this account, claiming that the training would involve just a small cadre of relay athletes hand-picked to run the SPH Relay event that weekend. Given the need for adequate rest, the relay focused on a short baton-passing drills and concluded by **5.30pm**.

> (iii)     Mr Daryl Chan, a track teacher at CHIJ Toa Payoh had studied school records and stated that there had been no official training for track athletes that day. Indeed, Friday had been replaced by _Tuesday_ as a formal training day for that entire first quarter of 2013. Mr Loh had also signed a payment form for work done for the month of March 2013, which did not reflect 15 March 2015. The fact that neither Ms Jaya nor Ms Aljunied realised this change of training day from Fridays to Tuesdays did cast doubt on the reliability of their recall.

> (iv)     Perhaps the most significant clue would be the two chain of text messages on 15 March 2013, the first between Mr Toh Wee Hong and Ms C[^328] and the second between Mr Tan Tze Jung and Mr Loh[^329]. To recap, the first was from an archived set of Ms C’s _WhatsApp_ chats showing Mr Toh Wee Hong inquiring with Ms C at 9.47 am on 15 March 2013, whether Mr Loh would be conducting any training at Bishan Stadium. Ms C had ultimately responded “_Tampines !!”_ at 1.53 pm. Ms C’s subsequent message at 3.26pm was that while Mr Loh had advised her, Zaki and Ms W to rest, she had resolved to attend as she had missed two days’ training. The message chain thus placed Ms C at Tampines Stadium in the late afternoon of 15 March 2013. By stark contrast, while Ms C’s request to train at Tampines Stadium in the afternoon of 15 March 2013 was acceded to, Mr Tan’s inquiry that morning whether there would be training had been met with Mr Loh’s admonition to “_Take a break today. I have meeting_…”.

> (v)     I would note that Mr Loh’s response would **_not_** be, in any case, a genuine reason not to train Mr Tan Tze Jung. As mentioned before, there was no reason to deny Mr Tan his training session if Mr Loh had indeed been, as claimed, in Bishan Stadium that afternoon, as it was the practice for private trainees undertake coterminous training with Mr Loh’s student cohort. Also, there was no real clash between the purported meeting and the training session as the former had been scheduled to occur **_after_** the training. While Mr Terry Tan had claimed to have taken leave on 13 March 2013, Mr Loh’s evidence suggests that he was unaware of this, and a face-to-face meeting would thus have notionally occurred after Mr Tan’s workday. Even conversely, taking Ms C’s chain of messages to show the true state of affairs (i.e. that he would be free to train private student athletes in Tampines Stadium), there would be no reason for Mr Loh to deny Mr Tan Tze Jung a place in a group training session there, unless, of course, it had been Mr Loh’s plan to train just Ms C **_individually_** in Tampines Stadium in the late afternoon of 15 March 2013.

### The message chain relating to the first training session

333    There was yet another message chain[^330] which both parties claimed to support their respective cases. This was a series of WhatsApp messaged which related to training arrangements on 17 February 2013, which had been the date identified by the prosecution where first individual training session have taken place. The defence took the stance that a training session had also occurred on 17 February 2013, only that this had been a **_joint_** training session. The message, spanning communications from 16 February 2013 to 21 February 2013, did show that private training sessions were malleable, with the composition changeable according to the availability of trainees, and Mr Loh’s selection of trainees to join in these sessions.

334    The messages had been screenshots taken from the mobile phone of DW10; Tan Wei Jie Eugene (Mr Eugene Tan or “Mr Tan”) and featured chats with DW6 Oon Kuan Yong and Ms C. The first two chat fragments featured Mr Eugene Tan and Mr Oon :

>   
| 

**16 February 2013** (Saturday, time: 11.16 am)

 |
| 

Mr Eugene Tan:

 | 

Hey Kuan Yong, Mr Loh just asked me to ask you to(_sic_) if you wanted to train with me tomorrow, Tampiness (_sic_). With (Ms C) too.

 |
| 

Mr Oon Kuan Yong:

 | 

OK

 |
| 

**21 February 2013** (Thursday, time: 12. 37 pm)

 |
| 

Mr Onn Kuan Yong:

 | 

Eugene, training 5 pm at ccab[^331], **_Mr Loh say don’t inform other ppl_**, Only you and me and cjc ppl

 |
| 

Mr Eugene Tan:

 | 

Kuan Yong I cannot train today. I told Mr Loh before. Tomorrow I’ll train. Sorry.

 |

  
  

335    The chats featuring Ms C on 17 February 2013 ran as follows:

>   
| 

**17 February 2013** (Sunday, time: 3.04 pm)

 |
| 

Mr Eugene Tan:

 | 

(Ms C) u late?

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

where r you? I just reached, in the toilet

 |
| 

Mr Eugene Tan:

 | 

He’s here!!!

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

S\*\*\* (expletive)

 |
| 

**17 February 2013** (Sunday, time: 6.07 pm)

 |
| 

Mr Eugene Tan:

 | 

If not I wouldn’t be under Mr Loh toooooo

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

He trained two generations?!?!

 |
| 

Mr Eugene Tan:

 | 

Well yeah I think I’m the second generation.

 |

  
  

336    At his cross-examination before DPP Rebecca Wong, Mr Tan recalled little of the training event. He had also input an entry of 8.00-9.00 pm at “Tampiness Stadium” in his Calendar for 17 February 2013, and also three timing annotations of 40.4, 41.6 and 44.4 for his 300-metre run, where he had admitted that he would ordinarily log the results of four runs. The witness could not recall what he had done during the workout, or even if he had indeed completed the workout, given his incomplete record. Mr Tan’s belief was that the entry of 8.00-900 pm in his calendar was wrongly entered, as he would not have stayed in Tampines Stadium from 3.00pm to 9.00 pm.

337    Mr Tan stated that he would “typically train from Monday to Saturday on a daily basis”[^332] and did not ordinarily train on Sundays. He could not remember why Mr Loh had called him out for meeting that day. Mr Tan also added that he would generally do the same workout as “Jonathan” a fellow longer distance runner from Anglo Chinese (Independent) school, he could not recall if he would also be doing the same workout as Ms C, who was a sprinter, and it was possible that she was engaged in a separate workout. Mr Tan stated that he did found the messages in an old mobile phone that he had replaced with a newer phone. Mr Tan noted that Ms C had texted him at 6.07 pm, which “_would suggest_ (he) _was not with her_”[^333] at the time.

338    While the defence had taken the messages to show that a group session had been held on 17 February 2013, the content of the messages, and Mr Tan’s characterisation of the training would not necessarily favour the defence case. The first aspect that was notable was that this stood as proof that Sunday trainings were indeed conducted for private trainees. While the session had seemingly involved a group training, at least at the outset, there had been only three trainees invited by Mr Loh. Mr Loh’s pattern of inviting **_only_** select athletes at will was seen in another text sent on 21 February 2013, where Mr Oon Kuan had told Mr Tan that Mr Loh had invited him for “_training 5 pm_” at the Co-curricular Activities Branch campus. Mr Oon had cautioned “**_Mr Loh say don’t inform other ppl_**_, Only you and me and cjc ppl_”. This was thus a group training with just two people.

339    The texts thus do show that for the afternoon of 17 February 2013, Ms C had indeed been at Tampines Stadium from 3.04 pm onwards, demonstrating that Sunday trainings were indeed held. Ms C had of course remembered being involved in an individual session. The prosecution had indicated that it had been possible for Ms C to have had an individual training session at the same venue; Tampines Stadium in the morning of 17 February 2013. I believed that there was a second possibility, which was that Ms C **_did_** attend in the **_afternoon_** of 17 February 2013, but no longer had an impression of the earlier part of the session, in particular that there had been two other trainees in attendance when she began. At cross-examination, Ms C admitted that she could not remember whether she had gone for a group training session on 17 February 2013.[^334] One should recall that Mr Tan also had no impression of the training he received, despite being an author in the message chain. A clue of what Mr Tan might have been doing could be provided by the other trainee; Mr Oon, who also had no clear recollection of the training that day but indicated that he and Mr Tan were involved in the same types of events[^335]:

> (D)uring that time that I mentioned just now that (Mr Eugene Tan) was doing 400 hurdles and he had 800 metres for the competition. So, **_I was also doing the same event. So, actually the reason why I text him was because we can train together_**, yah. So, then---there and then like on 17th Feb, right? We have been training together and of course then it will make more sense for me to (text) him to ask whether he’s training or not, yah.

340    Given Mr Oon’s testimony, it seemed the case that Mr Oon and Mr Tan had been training for longer distance events in Tampines Stadium while Ms C, a sprint specialist who was fast off the blocks but struggled to sustain momentum for her dash, would likely be focused on training specific to her event. If she had been concentrating on her own training and not interacted with the two trainees performing a differentiated type of training, she might not have remembered this earlier part of the session. Given that Mr Tan and Ms C had shared text messages at 6.07 pm and Mr Tan had only recorded three of a planned four timings for his 300-metre practice runs, Mr Tan had apparently left the practice earlier than Ms C. In such an event, Ms C would have continued alone and after the session been massaged for the first time by Mr Loh. Even if nothing had happened at this instance, the subsequent massages were to become the _raison d’etre_ of Ms C’s criminal complaint against Mr Loh. It would thus be unsurprising if her principally recollection would be of being alone post-training and receiving Mr Loh’s initial massage, which was done with her assuming the same posture as the other massages, and the less vivid impression of her co-trainees (who were training for their own track events) fading away in the three years between this Sunday session and her reporting to the police.

### What can be extrapolated from the messages leading to the training event on 17 February 2013

341    Also notable was the manner in which the passages betrayed Mr Loh’s firm hand in imposing his authority to the point of Ms C panicking and typing a frenzied expletive when Mr Tan had exclaimed “_he is here !!!_”. Mr Loh’s unquestioned authority and strict manner allowed for an unfettered imposition of his will, which explained Ms C’s compliance to his wishing to administer cool down massages on her person on three occasions.

342    I also noted Mr Oon’s evidence that Mr Loh would generally send messages for group training times and venues to his “_core group_” of veteran trainees, and Ms C was thus more likely to receive a notification of a group event from a “core” trainee acting on Mr Loh’s direction, where he (Mr Loh) would specify the trainees who should attend. With this trickle-down system, Ms C might not receive first-hand information on **_which_** trainees would be attending a session, which had likely contributed to a situation where she had ended up being the **_sole_** trainee in Tampines Stadium on 15 March 2013, when the other trainees had heeded Mr Loh’s advise to them to rest for the day. Hence, Mr Loh’s system of notifying his core trainees for disseminating information on the date, time and training venue was a fairly dynamic process, with a group session potentially convertible to an individual session when a single attendee could make it to the venue at the time stipulated. This being especially so, as trainees were free to opt out, or Mr Loh himself could dissuade specific trainees inquiring about training on a regular slot by telling the trainee concerned to take a break that day, as was evidently the case with Mr Tan Tze Jung on 15 March 2013.

## FINAL ANALYSIS

### The doctrine of “unusually convincing” evidence in sexual offences

343    The doctrine of “_unusually convincing_” evidence in sexual offences has been restated in recent authoritative pronouncements to encompass an expansive survey of evidence extending far beyond a narrow evaluation of the putative victim’s testimony. In _XP v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGHC 107</span> at \[29\] – \[35\], VK Rajah JA, made it plain that where the prosecution bears the burden of proof, an accused person’s testimony cannot be disregarded in a sexual assault allegation:

> The phrase "unusually convincing" is not a term of art; it does not automatically entail a guilty verdict and surely cannot dispense with the need to consider the other evidence and the factual circumstances peculiar to each case. Nor does it dispense with having to assess the complainant's testimony against that of the accused, where the case turns on one person's word against the other's.

344    In the subsequent decision of _Kunasekaran s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v PP_ \[2018\] SGHC 09 (“_Kunasekaran_”), Chan Seng Onn J referenced XP and held at \[26\]-\[27\]:

> 26    A complainant’s testimony would be considered “unusually convincing” only if the testimony, **_“when weighed against the overall backdrop of the available facts and circumstances, contains that ring of truth which leaves the court satisfied that no reasonable doubt exists in favour of the accused”._** A trial judge evaluates whether this standard is met **_by weighing the demeanour of the victim alongside both the internal and external consistencies found in the victim’s testimony._** See _Haliffie_ (\[14\] supra) at \[28\] citing _Public Prosecutor_ v _Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 601</span> at \[39\].

> 27    Further, it is necessary for a court to assess all the relevant evidence when determining whether the Prosecution’s case is proven beyond reasonable doubt. Hence, a court, when considering whether the victim’s evidence is “unusually convincing”, must “assess the victim’s testimony against that of the accused”, such that the victim is found to be “unusually convincing” to the extent that “the court can safely say his account is to be unreservedly preferred over that of another”: _XP_ v _Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGHC 107</span> at \[34\] per V K Rajah JA.”

> \[Emphasis added\]

### Guidance on the “unusually convincing” standard by the Court of Appeal in Public Prosecutor V GCK

345    The principles were further reaffirmed in the case of _Public Prosecutor_ v _GCK and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 486</span>; <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 2</span> (“_GCK_”). Here, the Court of Appeal reiterated that the consideration of whether a witness’ evidence meets the unusually convincing standard in cases of competing testimonies between the suspected offender and the putative victim to be an inquiry which required a holistic scrutiny of the totality of the evidence. This would also apply to the testimony of an **_eye-witness_** in situations where the accused was unable to give evidence as she was in a cognitively impaired vegetative state, as was the case in _GCK_. The Court of Appeal has held the evidence of an eyewitness is neither less nor more reliable than that of an alleged victim. The reliability of any witness’s observation and account must be assessed in light of all the circumstances in each individual case[^336]. The Court’s guidance on the holistic approach to evaluating if a witness’ evidence is set out below[^337]:

> (g)    The second way in which a reasonable doubt may arise is on an assessment of the totality of the evidence. **_The inquiry here is intimately connected with the “unusually convincing” standard, which arises in the context of mutually exclusive and competing testimonies._** The “unusually convincing” standard sets the threshold for a witness’s testimony to be preferred over the evidence put forth by the accused person where it is a case of one person’s word against another’s.

> (h)     **_The assessment of the Prosecution’s evidence under the “unusually convincing” standard must be made with regard to the totality of the evidence, which logically includes the case mounted by the Defence. The evaluative task is not just internal to the Prosecution’s case, but also comparative in nature._** Where the evidential burden lies on the Defence and this has not been discharged, the court may find that the Prosecution has discharged its burden of proving its case against the accused person beyond a reasonable doubt. At this stage, regard may be had to weaknesses in the Defence’s case.

> (i)    …

> (j)    …

> (k)     **_Whether an eyewitness’s uncorroborated evidence is unusually convincing_** (and therefore capable of discharging the Prosecution’s burden of proving the case against the accused person beyond a reasonable doubt) **_requires an assessment of the internal and external consistencies of the eyewitness’s account, and of any other evidence that the court is bound to consider_**, **_which includes the Defence’s case and the evidence adduced by the accused person (or the lack thereof)_**…

> \[Emphasis added\]

346    Given that the mandated approach is to study and weigh a witness’ testimony for internal and external consistencies, and juxtapose against the case presented by the defence, a good starting point for undertaking this analysis would be to refer to _Farida Begam d/o Mohd Artham v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 592</span>; <span class="citation">\[2001\] SGHC 333</span>[^338] where the High Court divided the taxonomy for the assessment of a witness’ credibility in three domains (at \[9\] of the judgment):

> 9    A judge can make a finding on the credibility of a witness based on some or all of the following:

>> (a)    (The witness’s) **_demeanour_**.

>> (b)    The **_internal consistency_** (or lack thereof) in the content of (the witness’s) evidence.

>> (c)    The **_external consistency_** (or lack thereof) between the content of the evidence and extrinsic evidence (for example, the evidence of other witnesses, documentary evidence or exhibits).

### The complainant’s inability to recall background details during an alleged sexual assault would not necessarily demonstrate any lack of internal consistency or implicate her credibility

347    While their central prong was the _alibi_ evidence, the defence sought to make inroads on Ms C’s credibility by casting doubt on the reliability of Ms C’s testimonial evidence. A considerable part of the defence’s submissions centred on Ms C’s apparent inability to recall specific details of the venue such as the colour of the walls and other fixtures at Tampines Stadium. Ms C also could not recall whether specific individual training sessions had been held in the mornings or late afternoons of the identified dates. I should note however that Ms C was able to recall features which were salient to the assault, which included the “_cages_” which held sporting equipment near the massage bed.[^339] Ms C appeared to be making genuine efforts to recall, and working out her recollection process from her ‘mind’s eye’ as she answered[^340]:

>   
| 

DPP:

 | 

(C)ould you tell us what position you were in on the massage bed? Where were your legs facing?

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

My legs were facing the door and I was facing the wall. Nope. But in my memory, the room is very big and the massage bed was in the middle of… so it wasn’t like touching any other space in the room. So when I say my head was facing the wall, there would be maybe like 3, 4 metres from the end of the massage bed to the wall.

 |

  
  

348    These details (the presence of cages and the size of the equipment room) were corroborated by Ms W in her testimony that there had indeed been cage enclosures in the equipment room and also that “(t)_he equipment room is quite big and there’s really a lot of equipment inside_.”[^341] Ms W was of course far more familiar with the environs of Tampines Stadium than the neophyte Ms C, who did not even live close to Tampines Stadium.

349    In _GCK_, the Honourable Chief Justice observed:

> 112    …(C)ourts have been advised to proceed with caution in making generalisations about observations and memory (see Mark L Howe, “The Neuroscience of Memory Development: Implications for Adults Recalling Childhood Experiences in the Courtroom” (2013) _Nature Reviews Neuroscience_ 14(12) 869 at 881):

>> **_… It is also important for jurors and judges to know that experiences that are encoded, stored, or retrieved during times of stress are not more likely to be remembered. Indeed, stress can actually impair the encoding and storage of autobiographical experiences and reduce the ability to retrieve specific episodic information during subsequent recall attempts._**

>> These scientific findings stand in stark contrast to judges’ and jurors’ beliefs about memory and its development … This gap needs to be closed so that decisions about guilt or innocence in the courtroom reflect the scientific ‘truths’ about memory and not simply ‘common sense’ beliefs of judges and jurors. …

> 113    Similarly, the scientific literature also shows that **_an individual’s capacity for observation and memory recall may not always lie on a continuum even when the account in question concerns events occurring within the same episode_** (see James Hopper & David Lisak, “Why Rape and Trauma Survivors Have Fragmented and Incomplete Memories” (_Time_, 9 December 2014)):

>> … Victims may remember in exquisite detail what was happening just before and after they realized they were being attacked, including context and the sequence of events. However, they are likely to have very fragmented and incomplete memories for much of what happens after that.

>> These advances in our understanding of the impact of trauma on the brain have enormous implications for the criminal justice system. It is not reasonable to expect a trauma survivor – whether a rape victim, a police officer or a soldier – to recall traumatic events the way they would recall their wedding day. They will remember some aspects of the experience in exquisitely painful detail. Indeed, they may spend decades trying to forget them. They will remember other aspects not at all, or only in jumbled and confused fragments. Such is the nature of terrifying experiences, and it is a nature that we cannot ignore.

> \[Emphasis in _italics_ in the original

> Emphasis in **_bold italics_** added\]

350    In respect of Ms C’s demeanour and internal consistency, I would, applying the nuanced understanding advocated in _GCK’s_ case, along with the contextual information of Ms C’s background as a then 18-year-old who was naïve in sexual matters as a result of her relatively cloistered upbringing, and the fact that she was in 2018 attempting to recall memories of events in 2013, be in general agreement with the observations made in the following three paragraphs of the learned DPP’s final submissions:

> 95.    The victim is unusually convincing because there was clarity and internal consistency in her evidence. The victim’s account on the two incidents of molest proper, was vivid and compellingly believable. Her account of the escalation of the contact across different sessions shows a logical progression and testing of the boundaries by the Accused. Her descriptive details on the finer distinctions between the two sexual contacts (the 1st being a ‘touch and go’ contact and the 2nd being a rub at the same spot) is textured and convincing.

> 96.    In light of the Accused’s authority over his trainees, it is coherent and reasonable behaviour that although the victim did not really want to be massaged on the day of the 2nd charge, she explained that she followed him because “he has the authority over you” as her coach, and she felt compelled to follow him to the equipment room.

> 97.    The victim remained unshaken in extensive cross-examination about the details pertaining to the offending, and how the Accused had molested her. She was unmistakably clear that there were three massages, and that the Accused had molested her in the course of the last two, the last one taking place in an equipment room. This was consistent with her own messages sent to Michelle Eng (DW5), her references to a room in her text to (Mr A) (PW5).

> 98.    The richness of her details about the offending to the extent of describing what she later understood may have been an orgasm to (Mr A) (PW5) shows the intensity of the experience and bears the ring of truth…

351    While the defence has sought to impugn Ms C’s recall of the exact motion and manner that Mr Loh had allegedly touched her with his thumb and precisely where he had touched on the occasions of alleged molestation, I found no reason to fault her description when I considered that Ms C had been reposed on a prone position, faced away from Mr Loh, and the **_stretchable_** fabric of her tights would make it difficult to pin-point precisely where the pressure was being exerted, as the stretch fabric would tend to diffuse rubbing and touch sensations. Also considering the length of the massage sessions when the offending took place, I accept that Ms C would be narrating a prolonged and dynamic episode, and that she would be trying to explain what had happened through a continuum of events.

352    There is an inherent **_internal consistency_** in Ms C’s narration of the progression of Mr Loh’s acts of sexual offending. Ms C had agreed to the initial massage after the first Sunday session on 17 February 2013. From the evidence put forth particularly the text massages supplied by Mr Eugene Tan. I believe that this had begun as a small group session, with Ms C, Mr Tan and Mr Oon beginning their training together sometime after 3.00pm. Ms C had likely forgotten about the first part of the training as she had concentrated on sprints and the two other trainees focused on their different events including 400 metre hurdles and an 800-metre running event. Ms C had evidently lingered in Tampines Stadium after the session (and possibly remembered her training in the latter period as an **_individual_** session), as Mr Tan had messaged her at 6.07pm, showing that the two were at different locations.

353    Mr Tan had completed only three of his four planned drills, with his timing deteriorating from 40.4 seconds on his first run to 44.4 seconds on his third. He could not remember the training at all, but the premised facts above would circumstantially suggest his ceasing training earlier than Ms C, especially if the utility of fourth run might be dubious given his poor athletic form that afternoon. I should also add that while Ms C, like Mr Eugene Tan, could not remember what she did **_during_** the workout, she had left open the possibility that she had not started the workout for the first session alone, qualifying her account with a cautious “_I_ **_probably_** _warmed up alone_”[^342] in her court testimony. I believe that with the effluxion of time, given that almost five years had passed from 17 February 2013 to the time of her testimony on 23 January 2018, Ms C had forgotten the specific detail of the event having started with two other trainees; Mr Eugene Tan and Mr Oon, which had **_segued_** to an individual session when the male trainees had left earlier (as evidenced by Mr Tan’s incomplete set of runs and his texting her at 6.07 pm), allowing for Mr Loh to suggest and perform the first massage. While this was an uneventful massage, the fact that Ms C had acquiesced had likely emboldened him to again subject Ms C to another massage on 24 February 2013, where he would visit his first, more subtle, intrusions on her person.

354    Ms C’s distorted recollection of the session _‘probably’_ being an **_entirely_** solo training session was obviously a mistaken impression. The phenomenon of such discrepancies cropping up when a witness testifies of a long-past event was addressed in _Public Prosecutor v Kesavan Pillai Govindan_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 44</span>, where Chan Seng Onn J had, in a chapter titled “_Relevance of inconsistencies_” stated at \[28\]:

> 28 Notwithstanding the discrepancies highlighted above, **_I accept the Prosecution’s submission that it would have been curious if no inconsistencies emerged at all_**, for, as even the Respondent’s counsel himself observed, at the time of the trial, the incident had taken place “almost 2½ years ago” \[note : 23\] .“**_The recollection of the details of particular events, particularly where these occur quickly, is easily susceptible to error with time_**”: _Public Prosecutor_ v _Tan Kim Seng Construction Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 2 SLR(R) 192</span> at \[27\].

> \[Emphasis added\]

355    Given that nothing untoward had happened, Ms C had thought nothing of proceeding with the second session on 24 February 2013. Mr Loh’s intrusion, while considerably more subtle than his later assault, had caused her some alarm and she had sought a measure of protection, by bringing her father along for the next session on 10 March 2013. The fact that the third session ended well, with the two men interacting amicably and even sharing an umbrella (which she anecdotally shared with Mr Oon) lulled her to continue the training sessions with Mr Loh. Even so, the final session was one where she had sought **_other_** trainees to go with her to Tampines Stadium[^343]. It was only at 3.34pm that day that realised that she would be training alone after she was told by Mr Toh Wee Hong that he would be attending, as the “_NTU boys_” had been advised by Mr Loh to rest.

### The complainant’s anger and strong language did not detract from the internal consistency of her case

356    It had always been quite evident that Ms C had conflicted feelings about the accused and seemed to find it difficult to process her initial admiration and respect for Mr Loh, as against her anger for what he had allegedly done during two of the individual training sessions. Ms C’s conflict in this regard is epitomised by this fragment of her testimony while explaining her WhatsApp messages[^344]

> . .. Like, **_I really didn’t want to think that he was sick, dirty old man_**, you know. **_I really … wanted him to still be that coach that I looked up to and I respected and that I trusted_**. So you obviously, it’s so much easier to keep thinking like that instead of thinking that this person that I really trusted is a sick pervert, right? Yah, right?

> \[Emphasis added\]

357    In this regard on Ms C’s conflicted feelings, it would be apposite to also mention Ms C’s _WhatsApp_ messages where she had made rather strong remarks which included a wish to castrate Mr Loh. To recap, she had stated “_Now it just makes me wna chop off his d\*\*\*\* and help prostitutes and stop rape when I grow up or smth heh_”. As stated in the foregoing, this statement had been predicated on Ms Eng herself making seemingly sympathetic statements which had likely increased Ms C’s sense of victimisation. Besides repeatedly blaming herself for Ms C’s situation, Ms Eng’s remarks included her concern that Ms C might be scarred for life and fears of her being unable to relate intimately with her eventual life partner. I would note that the tail end “_when I grow up or smth heh_”, does add an air of flippancy, and did not seem a serious articulated threat to mutilate, or otherwise visit an act of revenge, against Mr Loh.

358    Ms C had expressed similar sentiments in her court testimony where she had first conceded[^345] that her text “_looks very vulgar_” but then reiterated that “_The whole thing just makes me, just feel very angry when such stuff happens to like rape victims_” and repeated her wish that “_sick pervert_(s)… _like molesters and rapist_(s)” be punished in the manner described, repeating again “_Like it makes you so angry_”. Ms C had later clarified that what she had expressed was “_like a fantasy thing_”.[^346] The defence had also flagged Ms C’s sharing with Ms W an anecdotal account, related by her (Ms C’s) friend of a local media personality performing an act of gross indecency in that friend’s presence, in her _WhatsApp_ chat.[^347] Counsel had characterised Ms C “_light-heartedly sharing_” of the anecdote as “_irresponsible_” and “_very reckless_” behaviour even if this had occurred just between Ms W and her. Ms C reiterated that she had only shared the anecdote, as related by her friend, with Ms W and not reported the friend’s revelation to the police.

### The existence of intemperate posts show that WhatsApp messages have not been “sanitised” or otherwise specially curated for reading by any third party

359    While it would be open to the defence team (who were afforded an opportunity to examine Ms C extensively)[^348] to question her credibility and mental stability as a result of these posts, which they had indeed done in both the submissions of no-case and their final submissions, the fact remains that Ms C’s intemperate behaviour is **_not inconsistent_** when viewed with the entirety of her conflicted emotions and well documented anger.

360    In making the observation set out above, I am not, by any means, attempting any psychological diagnosis to interpret or explain her behaviour, which was beyond the remit of a judge presiding over and adjudicating a criminal trial. Nevertheless, while matters of psychology would be “_scientific information likely to be outside the experience and knowledge of a judge”_, it would still be the court’s function, as finder of fact, to form and express a view on the level of consistency between Ms C’s testimony and documentary evidence (see _Ng So Kuen Connie_ v _Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 3 SLR(R) 178</span>; <span class="citation">\[2003\] SGHC 164</span> at \[24\]-\[25\]).

361    In my judgment, Ms C has been entirely **_consistent_** in demonstrating her anger, and expressing a degree of contempt towards Mr Loh, as well as maintaining a high level of antipathy against sex offenders in general, in her court testimony. It should therefore not come as a surprise if her views were **_also_** captured in messages; to one case to a confidante who had asserted that the same type of sexual assaults had been visited on her, and to another; her school coach, who had projected supportiveness and concern, and seemed to believe her at the time.

362    It is, in my view, notable that these posts, which would not have put Ms C in a particularly good light remained intact and unabridged when extracted from her mobile phone. The fact that the communications were made in the first place from March 2013 and June 2016 respectively, and remained undisturbed there for forensic processes to be undertaken militates against any argument that the messages, especially the earlier set between Ms C and Ms W) were created for the purpose of framing Mr Loh with accusations of sexual assault. If there had been such an attempt, the co-conspirators would have been expected to carefully create a **_picture-perfect_** ‘script’ of _WhatsApp_ exchanges. Such a carefully curated ‘script ‘would likely be sanitised for any content that might cause the maker of the _WhatsApp_ statements seem less credible or reliable as a witness.

363    This obviously did not happen here, and Ms C was seen to post a salacious but unverified anecdote from her friend of the said misdeeds of the media personality in her chat with Ms W in 2013. She would, three years later make obviously unguarded remarks to Ms Eng containing vituperative allusions to (among other things) castrating the accused. All considered, where there any basis for diminution of Ms C’s credibility as a result of her strong language and her careless anecdote about the media personality in her _WhatsApp_ posts, this would be at least offset by the increased probability that all her _WhatsApp_ posts in Exhibit P-3, as a result of their plainly unedited and “unsanitised” nature, were **_authentic_** and **_spontaneously_** written messages, rather than contrived components of an instrument purpose-fabricated to frame Mr Loh. I should add that I would have taken a considerably different view of Ms C’s credibility if there had been any trace of suppression or deletion of embarrassing, potentially compromising or otherwise “problematic” messages on her part before she handed her phone and other devices over to IO Alan Khor for extraction of digital data.

### The complainant’s demeanour

364    The defence has alluded to some aspects of Ms C demeanour which they found unsatisfactory. I had closely observed Ms C in her nine days at the witness stand. Ms C had been in my view, a forthright witness. At cross-examination, there had been signs of abrasiveness and strain in Ms C’s exchanges with counsel, where Ms C had occasionally answered in a sarcastic or mildly derisive manner. Notwithstanding these sporadic episodes, Ms C showed no sign of evasiveness and seemed able to answer with minimal hesitation. There were moments when she paused to recall a detail, Ms C would take pains to explain how she visualised the event in her ‘mind’s eye’[^349]in this case attempting to recall if she had told Ms W about her first session on 17 February 2013:

>   
| 

Counsel

 | 

What was her (Ms W’s) reaction? Can you remember?

 |
| 

Ms C

 | 

I don’t remember the mental image of me telling her, so I don’t remember the reaction.

 |
| 

Counsel

 | 

I’m just a bit puzzled, so can I clarify? You say “mental image” a few times, actually, in your evidence.

 |
| 

Ms C

 | 

I guess that’s how I … remember things…my brain just captures the moment, you know?

 |
| 

Counsel

 | 

Like a photograph?

 |
| 

Ms C

 | 

In the head, yah.

 |

  
  

365    Despite the difficulties inherent in having to revisit and articulate a patently traumatic experience, Ms C was remarkably lucid and cogent in expressing herself, as this fragment narrating the aftermath of the alleged assault on 15 March 2013 will show:[^350]

> …So it just stopped and I---we just went out of the massage room. And I went to take my bag and I went to the toilet to change up as usual. I remember crying in the toilet because of how gross I felt---I felt. And I just felt so dirty. And I knew when I came out of the toilet, I would still have to see his face. So I sat in the toilet and I was just trying to control myself. And I went out to the sink and I looked at myself, I remember. And I just like---I tried to like wash it all out, you know, like just---just **_like pretend nothing happened_**. **_Just told myself nothing happened._** And I walked out and I saw him. Like, you know, like---like nut---**_like nothing happened_**. So he just talked to me. **_Nothing happened_**. Just completely normal. **_Nothing happened_**. So---then he said, “Let’s go eat.” …

> \[Emphasis added\]

### The complainant’s Twitter message on 15 March 2013 at 9.24 pm

366    I have highlighted Ms C’s repeated references in her court testimony to ‘_psych_’ or put herself in a mental state as if “_nothing happened_” in the passage above as a coping mechanism to handle what had just happened. Ms C’s enigmatic Twitter message, date-stamped 15 March at 9.24 pm, should be seen in this light. The message was only discovered by Ms C on 25 January 2018, and produced in court on 26 January 2018, two days after her testimony reproduced above. To recap Ms C had sent the Twitter message at 9.24 pm, stating “_Prettiest crescent moon ever and so many stars in the sky_”. This has attracted a response from “Iggy” or Ignatius, a member of the training group inquiring _“How was your time trial_?” Ms C’s response of “_Surprisingly easy only 80 x 3_”, had been taken by the prosecution as corroboration that she had been in a training session, as she had, by her response, updated Iggy of having just performed a time trial by running three 80 metre sprints.

### Whether the complainant’s Twitter message was an atypical reaction to a sexual assault

367    In her court testimony on her reaction, counsel had asked Ms C if she had been “**_angry_**”. Ms C had responded:[^351]

> Can I---can I just say I was grossed out, like, that really just describe my feeling. Now, if you’re like asking me to feel different things, then I will try to imagine myself at that state and put these different emotions in my mind and it doesn’t seem to make sense. **_Like, what I really felt was just like---like very confused and dirty_**.

368    The exchange between counsel and Ms C had already been set out at length earlier in these grounds[^352]. Suffice to say, counsel had challenged her being “_still in a mood to admire the moon_” despite being “_grossed out_”. Ms C had then surmised that she might have wished to “_cast aside gross things_” and focus on “_positive aspects of life_”.

369    What I would understand from Ms C’s responses was that she had been overwhelmed with a _melange_ of mixed emotions, with a predominant of feeling “_confused and dirty_”. She had sent the tweet later in a bid “_cast aside_” or forget the traumatic experience by focusing on more “_positive aspects of life_”, which in this context would presumably entail her musing of features she could see of the cosmos she could see in the night sky. It is quite trite that the behavioural reactions of victims involved in situations where sexual offences are alleged cannot be stereotypically strait-jacketed. Given this wide amplitude of possible behaviours, I would see nothing atypical for a person in the aftermath of a distressing event to feel overwhelmed, and apply coping strategies to try to distract, or otherwise numb, themselves from the shock of the traumatic experience. She had evidently not yet decided on any course of action, and her revelation to Ms W would be **_two days_** later, on 17 March 2013. In that context, and with her explanation, Ms C’s Twitter post on the night sky did not show her to preternaturally calm and unaffected, as counsel would suggest. The following quote from _Best Practice & Research Clinical Obstetrics and Gynaecology_ affords an insight to possible dissociative reactions observed after a sexual assault[^353]:

> It is likely that dissociative processes at the time of the trauma will permit the victim to endure the otherwise unendurable; consequences of dissociation occurring at the time of the trauma include the following: **_losing track of what was going on_**; **_engaging in behaviours without actively deciding to do so_**; **_time becoming altered_** (e.g. things seem to be happening in slow motion, or at speed); **_sensory disturbances_** (e.g. moments when one’s body appears distorted or changed)30; and increased likelihood of the individual developing PTSD.

> \[Emphasis added\]

370    It was “_Iggy’s”_ response in the Twitter exchange which would lend strong corroborative support of the external consistency of her case. While some defence witnesses have tried to make the point that a time trial should be done with another person assisting the coach, Mr Loh’s authoritarian and eclectic coaching style (where he would devise a workout on-the-spot for a specific trainee) meant that he could metaphorically ‘_call the shots_’ and trainees would comply, even if there was a deviation from the norm. In any case, Ms C’s weakness was her “_pick-up_” while sprinting, where she could not project enough power in her strides to maintain her pace, as she was a fast starter. She would thus be less likely to question Mr Loh’s improvisation of having her raise her right arm to signal her start,[^354] for the purpose of timekeeping. Ms C stated that the 80-metre sprint “_surprisingly easy_”[^355] as this was a short distance allowing for a quick recovery before the next attempt, as opposed to a 400-metre time trial.

### External consistency

371    External constancy in the context of this case would principally relate to the manner that the complainant’s evidence comported with external testimonial, documentary, and circumstantial evidence. There was a significant level of external consistency between Ms C’s testimony and that of her parents, and Ms W and Mr A. Ms C’s evidence on the individual training sessions also cohered with the “**_document trail”_** of evidence, which extended not just to the _WhatsApp_ chats with Ms W, Mr A and Ms Eng in P-3-1 to P3-52, but also her _Twitter_ post on 15 March 2013 (elaborated on in the preceding paragraphs where she mentioned the three sets of 80 metre time trials she had just run), and her exchange of _WhatsApp_ messages on 15 March 2013 at P16-42 with Mr Toh Wee Hong, where she had told him that the venue was Tampines Stadium.

372    The **_convergence_** of external consistency would also extend to the documentary exhibits proffered by the defence, notably Exhibit D51; the chain of messages introduced by Mr Eugene Tan (albeit that my hypothesis is that the session on 17 February 2013 began as a notional **_group_** session of three trainees and ended as effectively as an individual session of just Ms C remaining, who had received a massage from the accused), and Exhibit D34; which was Mr Tan Tze Jung’s inquiry with Mr Loh whether there would be training on 15 March 2013, where Mr Loh had told his trainee that he had a meeting to attend to, despite the fact that the claimed meeting was, according to Mr Loh and Mr Terry Tan held after 6.00pm, when training activities (held co-terminously with school athletes on weekdays) should have, by then, concluded.

### There was no evidence of any malign intention by PW 3 to frame the accused

373    There is also an inherent external consistency in both the **_content_** and the **_background_** circumstances leading to their creation. I would first refer to the tentative communications with Ms W on 17 March 2013, and her subsequent revelations to Mr A some two weeks later. Given that there had been no enmity between her and Mr Loh at this point (mid-late 2013), it would seem implausible that Ms C would have ‘_created_’ these messages with a long-term view to frame Mr Loh three years later. As the learned DPPs observed at \[124\] of their Submissions:

> There is absolutely no reason for her to fabricate these messages to Ms W and Mr A five years ago, in year 2013. There was no challenge to the veracity and reliability of the messages being sent and received. There was no reason for her to fabricate the messages in 2013 and wait three years until 2016 to make the allegations.

374    If the framing of Mr Loh were Ms C’s intent, her disclosures of her attenuated version of events to Ms Michelle Eng in 2013, (where she had not revealed the full extent of Mr Loh’s alleged intrusions) would have been unsafe to any ‘plot’ to frame Mr Loh. This is given Ms Eng’s perceived closeness to Mr Loh, a fact known to both Ms C and Ms W. The evidence also showed that Ms C had been slow to reveal the alleged acts of molestation to other individuals. She had revealed to Ms W, only after Ms W herself had requested that that she not be left accompanied with Mr Loh (“_But I don’t wna do it alone_”) on 8 March 2013[^356]. In relation to Mr A, Ms C’s revelation to him was also properly explained as a mutual unburdening of issues that had apparently caused angst to them, her of coming to terms with an alleged sexual assault, and he of divesting his closeted secret and “coming out” (i.e., telling the world at large) that he was homosexual in orientation. The _WhatsApp_ trail of messages would amply substantiate this narrative.

### The reason for the delay in reporting the alleged sexual assaults is coherent and fully corroborated

375    The defence has made considerable submissions of Ms C’s delay in promptly reporting the alleged outrages of her modesty[^357]. Case law suggests that delays in reporting sexual crimes deserved a proper contextual analysis before making a call on whether the credibility of the putative victim should be impugned for the delay. Aedit Abdullah J in _Public Prosecutor v Yue Roger Jr_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 749</span> held at \[30\]:

> **_I accepted that victims of sexual offences may not behave in a stereotypical way._** Many victims report their sexual abuse early to a family member, friend, the police or other person in authority. However, there is no general rule requiring victims of sexual offences to report the offences immediately or in a timely fashion. **_Instead, the explanation for any such delay in reporting is to be considered and assessed by the court on a case-by-case basis_** (see DT v PP <span class="citation">\[2001\] 2 SLR(R) 583</span> at \[62\]; _Tang Kin Seng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 3 SLR(R) 444</span> at \[79\]). While I accept that an omission to report the offence in a timely fashion, in the absence of other evidence, may in certain circumstances make it difficult to establish a case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt, I emphasise that the effect of any delay in reporting always falls to be assessed on the specific facts of each individual case.

> \[Emphasis added\]

376    In this regard, the circumstances show that Ms C had told Ms W and Mr A respectively two days and two weeks after the final sexual assault, she had then been instigated by Mr A to tell Ms Eng. In the latter case, I am satisfied that she did give an attenuated account to Ms Eng on an unascertained date in 2013, which Ms Eng never acted upon (Ms Eng had wavered about being told by Ms C that she was “_uncomfortable_” while training with Mr Loh either in 2015 or 2016, which she had also unaccountably never sought clarification not acted upon before the messages of 2 June 2016 and documented in Exhibit P-3). Thereafter Ms C had settled herself to allowing her case to lie dormant. She had only re-surfaced her case by sending the text message to Ms Eng when she believed that more female students would be sent to Mr Loh by the latter in early June 2016. The concerns were clearly documented in the message itself. As already set out in detail in an earlier part of these grounds, the final chain of events that had triggered the police report had been precipitated by the news article sent by Mr A to Ms C.

377    The Evidence Act (Cap 97 1997 Rev Ed) provides for contemporaneous statements to be used as corroborative evidence, with section 159 stating:

> _Former statements of witness may be proved to corroborate later testimony as to same fact_

> 159.   **_In order to corroborate the testimony of a witness_**, **_any former statement made by such witness, whether written or verbal_**, on oath, or **_in ordinary conversation_**, relating to the same fact at or **_about the time when the fact took place_**, or before any authority legally competent to investigate the fact, may be proved.

> \[Emphasis added\]

378    Essentially then, Ms C’s account was corroborated by Ms W’s and Mr A’s testimonies, which were in turn supported by the trail of text messages exchanged giving an insight to their motivations and discussions as events unfolded. The messages, which were set out earlier in these grounds, allowed a high level of contemporaneity and external consistency to the body of evidence, I consequently found Ms C’s reason for the delayed reporting to be coherent and entirely believable.

### The complainant’s father was an essential corroborating witness

379    Ms C’s father’s account also added immeasurably to the extrinsic consistency of the prosecution’s case. Mr F had corroborated Ms C’s evidence and testified that he had been present at an **_individual_** training session between Ms C and Mr Loh, where he did not see any other trainees, which would belie Mr Loh’s claim that he did not conduct individual training sessions. The father’s evidence was of having dropped off his daughter. After Mr Low had come to the scene, it had started to rain “heavily”. Ms C’s father’s evidence is in turn **_externally consistent_** with metrological evidence showing for Tampines Stadium (Exhibit P18) showing an episode of rain between 5.00 pm 6.00 pm on Sunday 10 March 2013, flagged, of course, by the prosecution as the likely date of a third truncated training session.

380    To recapitulate, PW1 had been wrong in recalling that this had occurred in a weekday at a late morning. This timing would have been contrary to **_both_** the Prosecution’s and Defence’s cases, given the consensus that Mr Loh did not conduct morning training on weekdays for his private athletes, and Ms C would have been working at the time of the day. To be fair in respect of the father’s failure of recall, some five years had elapsed when the father gave his evidence in in court in 2018. In _Public Prosecutor_ v _Datuk Haji Harun bin Haji Idris (No 2)_ <span class="citation">\[1977\] 1 MLJ 15</span>, Raja Azlan Shah FJ (as he then was) had provided a considered observation that discrepancies were expected in witnesses making honest attempts at recall, and a preternaturally exact or ‘perfect’ recall between different witnesses might suggest collusion:

> **_I shall be almost inclined to think that if there are no discrepancies, it might be suggested that they have concocted their accounts of what had happened or what had been said because their versions are too consistent_**. The question is whether the existence of certain discrepancies is sufficient to destroy their credibility…

381    The defence had also questioned Mr F’s recollection of the rainfall being heavy[^358], where the meteorological record showed a level of precipitation closer to moderate rainfall. In this respect, as Mr F was using an umbrella (and sharing it at some point with Mr Loh, according to the anecdote Mr C related to Mr Oon Kuan Yong[^359]) and waiting his daughter to complete his workout in Tampines Stadium, I did not think it fair to fault Mr F’s ability to assess whether the rain was heavy or moderate, as his sense of rain intensity would be hindered by the umbrella, which would could be expected block a significant part of his visual field, and his principal perception of rain would be the staccato of raindrops falling on his umbrella. What matters is that his account is congruent with his daughter’s description of the party of three being beset by rain during an individual training session in Tampines Stadium that they had attended together. Ultimately Mr F’s account would be closer to the mark than Ms Eng’s account, which was instead of Mr F attending a group training on a Saturday morning in early January 2013, where the meteorological record did not show any rainfall on the first two Saturday mornings of that year.

### Corroborating evidence from various witnesses explained Ms C’s seemingly acquiescent behaviour leading to the alleged final molestation on 15 March 2013

382    Another aspect of external consistency was provided by Ms W in her corroborating evidence of Ms C’s account of the relationship Mr Loh had with his trainees, which lent an insight to Ms C’s acquiescence to go for the third and final group trainings, and particularly in her agreeing to accompany Mr Loh to the equipment room for him to administer a massage. To be clear, Ms C had already been on her guard after contact was made by Mr Loh’s thumbs on her vulva during the second massage on 24 February 2013, and she had taken her father, as a _prophylaxis_ of sorts, to the third training session in the afternoon of 10 March 2013. The evidence suggests that she had expected the session on 15 March 2013 to have been a group session and would have only known at 3:34 pm[^360] that afternoon that Mr Toh Wee Hong, who was the person who had raised the query whether there would be training that day, would not be going. From the _WhatsApp_ exchange, Ms C had persisted to go to Tampines Stadium alone because she had missed two workouts and felt the need to make up with a workout that day.

383    Ms Eng had of course described Mr Loh as a mentor to her and a “_like a grandfather figure to the younger kids_” in her police statement. Ms C has a **_similar_** sense of Mr Loh’s presence in the lives of his trainees and described him as “_always calling to check up on us, this and that. Just very, very present in your life. And I also said he was really, like_… _a dad or… grandfather for me_.”[^361]

384    The prosecution had pointed to[^362] the high degree of authority Mr Loh exercised and the consequent influence and control which played on his trainees’ minds, pointing to the messages between Mr Oon Kuan Yong and Ms W upon her rejection of Mr Loh’s help to obtain a place in a local polytechnic to show that the extent that “_trainees were concerned about displeasing_” Mr Loh, and which “_reflect_(ed) _the extent of authority and influence he had over them. Effectively, his athletes were conditioned to respect, listen and follow Mr Loh’s instructions and complete it no matter how tough, and to believe that he knew best and acted in their best interests_.” I would particularly agree with the DPPs’ astute observation at \[67\] of their submissions that:

> The trainees understandably felt close to Mr Loh, because he treated them in a **_relational and not transactional manner_**, not limited to results-driven, training centric interactions.

> \[Emphasis added\]

385    This relationship is vividly on display in the various images put up by the defence of Mr Loh and his trainees, in the course of the trial. Ms W is featured in many of the images, with Ms C somewhat less so, given that Ms W had been with the group from Secondary school. The images often feature a group in a celebratory setting, and invariably projected a sense of _bonhomie_, camaraderie, and common purpose in their sporting pursuits. The comity and friendship shared spilled well beyond the confines of the stadium walls as Ms Amirah Aljunied would relate her annual visits, around Chinese New Year, to Mr Loh’s apartment to give him a chocolate cake[^363]. Within this milieu, Ms C grew to trust and gain considerable respect for Mr Loh, who had provided his services free of charge. Ms C felt a debt of gratitude and was keen to follow his every instruction, as the fragment of testimony will show. Ms C had been narrating how she had been notified of her **_second_** individual training session, on 24 February 2013, by Mr Loh and revealed how she was prepared to follow his every instruction[^364]:

>   
| 

Ms C

 | 

Mr Loh made it clear (_that the training would be an individual session_) And I just felt like… **_quite lucky to even get one on one training sessions with him. Like he actually cared about how I performed for my competition_**.

 |
| 

DPP

 | 

Now, (Ms C), could you elaborate a little bit more on how Mr Loh made it clear? Do you remember what he said or communicated?

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

I don’t I know… I know, during training, there was once when he just said that I was just going to train with him this Sunday. Then I just said, “Okay.” **_Because I really just--- he tell me where to go, I just go. So he asked me to train, I just go and train._**

 |

  
  

386    As characterised from the foregoing, the relationship dynamics would make Ms C very malleable to any suggestion that Mr Loh made which was connected to improving her level in her chosen sport, even a second massage in an equipment room, especially since Mr Loh had taken the trouble to arrange the session just her and was doing this _gratis_. It would be the case too that Ms C was affected by the dissonance between Mr Loh’s usual avuncular persona and what had happened at the second training session that she had decided to give him the benefit of the doubt to ascribe that first contact to her clothed vulva region to a mistake as “_maybe he’s so old and big and clumsy_”[^365].

387    There was of course no such room for doubt when the second assault had occurred, where the alleged molestation had been so forceful prolonged that it had brought her to the point of an involuntary orgasm. In the immediate aftermath, Ms C’s confusion and mental turmoil had been painfully obvious, as could be seen in her Twitter post on the night of 15 March 2013, where she had striven to project normality in her chat with “Iggy” after answering his inquiry about her own time trial results. The pull of the antecedent relationship had however made her reluctant to put Mr Loh to account, even as she had revealed the assaults just two days later to Ms W. Mr A, to whom she had made a revelation two weeks later, was the eventual instrument which brought the sexual assaults to light. He had begun the chain of events, reminded Ms C to speak to Ms Eng, and even approached Ms Eng herself to prompt her that Ms C had something to say to her. Ms Eng had of course never acted on Ms C’s claim. The final piece which had taken the matter to the full glare of investigative scrutiny had been Ms C’s inquiry with an official from the Singapore Athletic Association after another coach had been taken to task for molesting a trainee. Ms C had thereafter found the gumption and resolve to make a report with Ms W in the afternoon of Saturday 30 July 2016. My purpose of reiterating the above sequence yet again is to show the sequential coherence backed by externally consistent evidence of the case brought by the prosecution.

### The defence case lacks internal and external consistency

388    Mr Loh’s own evidence, on the other hand, has been beset by a number of unaccountable incongruities. As seen from the foregoing, Mr Loh’s bid to resort to the defence of **_alibi_** had fallen short, with significant inconsistencies found in the testimonial evidence and an instance where his account was at variance with the meteorological evidence.

### The accused’s alibi accounts for 10 March 2013 and 15 March 3013 were effectively “Lucas lies”

389    I was of the view that at least **_two_** of Mr Loh’s three _alibi_ accounts amounted to _Lucas_ lies. The principle is drawn from the case of _Regina_ v _Lucas (Ruth_) <span class="citation">\[1981\] 3 WLR 120</span> (_at_ 123), which held that lies told by an accused person might be capable of amounting to corroboration if they were deliberate, related to a material issue, premised upon a motive of realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth, and proven independently to be untrue. I would allow that the _alibi_ for 24 February 2013 failed only for lack of evidence to prove Mr Loh never left his apartment. Mr Loh’s alibi evidence for the afternoon of 10 March 2013 and 15 March 2013, however, were ridden with inconsistencies which could not possibly be true, when set against objective evidence. While the facts have already been set out in extensive detail earlier in these grounds, I will give a brief _precis_ to illustrate my view on how Mr Loh’s evidence in these instances might be regarded as “_Lucas_ lies”.

390    As explained in the foregoing, Mr Loh had claimed to be with Mr Tan Wei Leong at the _Akira Swift 60th Anniversary Track and Field Championship 2013_. Despite sitting at a conspicuous part of Toa Payoh Stadium, neither he nor Mr Tan could name any runner who had taken part in the competition, nor name the guest of honour. Moreover, he could not explain any coherent purpose for going there, as the event was not organised by the Singapore Athletic Association, and Mr Loh’s sole alibi witness had admitted to both Mr Loh and him not being on friendly terms with Swift Club[^366]. Both men had given separate timings for when they left Toa Payoh stadium. The **_objective_** proof of the falsity of the alibi came from the party of two being oblivious to the 80-minute spell of rainfall which had occurred as the time the proceedings ended, and the two men had adjourned to a coffee shop and extending to the time they would have parted ways. The rainfall was unequivocally proven by meteorological records[^367] adduced by the prosecution.

391    Mr Loh’s inconstancies were even more pronounced in the case of his alibi defence for 15 March 2013. The documentary evidence showed that Friday, 15 March 2013 was not a formal training day for CHIJ (Toa Payoh)’s track and field trainees. For the first quarter of 2013, Tuesdays had replaced Fridays as the designated training day. An attendance record had not shown any attendance taken for 15 March 2013, and Mr Loh himself had signed twice on a payment form which specified ten training days in March 2013 but had not included 15 March 2013 as a day he had trained the track and field team. The defence also could not overcome the paradox of the two message chains (between Ms C and Mr Toh Wee Hong[^368], and Mr Loh and Tan Tze Jung[^369]) sent on 15 March 2013, with Ms C telling Mr Toh that she had learnt that the venue was “_Tampines!!”_, and Mr Loh telling Mr Tan, who was evidently hoping to join in a training session that day. that he (Mr Loh) would be engaged in a “_meeting_”, with the purported event, by the account of Mr Loh and his alibi witness, oddly occurring **_after_** the time after the training session would have ended.

392    Two defence witnesses had taken the fall-back position that the training had not been documented as a formal event, as it had been a special occasion to **_fine-tune_** elite runners participating in the SPH Relay races over the weekend of 16-17 March 2013, with the truncated session ending by 5.30pm. This was not consonant with Mr Loh’s evidence that he had conducted regular training for the full cadre of trainees and had ended past 6.00pm. I have already gone to considerable detail on how I found it implausible that Mr Loh would have made Mr Terry Tan, a DSP of Prisons, come from Tanah Merah to wait for him at Bishan Stadium, just to hold a two-man meeting. Given the comparison of the accused’s version of events and the ascertainable facts, I was of the view that both of Mr Loh’s alibi accounts could not be true.

### The accused’s conduct after being told that police reports had been filed against him also raised suspicions

393    There are two other aspects where the accused’s contentions and conduct have made further inroads into his own credibility. The first would be Mr Loh claiming that he had effectively imposed demands on (_then_) Senior Station Inspector of Police Goh Teck Heng, who had been tasked to investigate into the case following the reports made by Ms C and Ms W for IO Goh to state the names of the complainants and the substance of the complaints or he (Mr Loh) would refuse to attend a police interview. To be clear I found Mr Loh’s claims of his succeeding in compelling IO Goh to reveal the names of the complainants and details of their police reports, to him to be totally implausible. To recap, IO Goh had two brief tele-conversations in the morning of 31 July 2016, before he had first met Mr Loh later that day, only to be told that the latter had just undergone an operation, and was covered by a medical certificate, and had asked for the interview to be rescheduled. Mr Loh had, quite enigmatically, next appeared before IO Goh on 2 August 2016 brandishing a photograph that he had taken with Ms C holding a cake during the rescheduled statement recording (Exhibit P23-1). The image had a stamp showing that this had been sent by a certain ‘_Joseph_’ at 8.50 pm on 31 July 2016.

394    I found it improbable that an experienced police officer would have committed such an egregious breach of investigation protocol by **_revealing_** the names of putative victims of a sexual offence **_before_** taking a statement, with the risks of evidence tainting or witness subordination being all too obvious. As elaborated on in the foregoing, the practice of never revealing the victim’s identity or details of the victim before a statement was recorded would necessarily be a fundamental and ingrained aspect of investigative protocol, and there appeared no reason for the officer to jeopardize the investigation by such a disclosure. Any investigation officer would have found Mr Loh’s demand inappropriate, especially in the context of offences of a sexual nature.

395    It seemed to me that Mr Loh had asserted this disclosure as a cover story to explain his own slip-up in letting on that he had somehow known the identity of the complainants, which he had inadvertently telegraphed by producing the singular image of Ms C (as well as several images of Ms W).

396    Further, while Mr Loh has asserted that he had been told the names of the complainants, he had never claimed to have been told the times or dates of the alleged offences by IO Goh. The image of the birthday celebrations in April 2013 would seem to show Mr Loh making a bid to convince that his relations with Ms C were well before that date. To be clear, Mr Loh’s trainees were able to source a number of later-in-time images of Ms C including one of her and a group of athletes from the group communally lying on a stadium track on 23 July 2013 post-workout, and her association with these private trainees extending well into 2014. The defence had also contended that Ms C had called him on 6 November 2013 to wish him a “_happy birthday_”. Mr Loh had also thus seemed to demonstrate, without being told, that he had a sense of **_when_** the material time for the alleged sexual crimes had been.

### The accused’s pre-emptive actions were incongruous

397    The other aspect that I found peculiar was the accused’s extremely reactive conduct in the wake of his discovery of the police reports being made against him. Mr Loh had postponed the recording of his police statement on 31 July 2016, stating that he was recovering from surgery. Ms W had within hours received the first call from Ms T chastising her and warning of consequences of making false accusations. Mr Loh was not averse to admitting that he had turned to his athletes and had apparently mustered the trainees to collect material before attending his re-scheduled interview on 2 August 2016, with images of Ms C and Ms W, in what in retrospect seemed an ill-considered bid to prove that he had maintained good relations with Ms C as of April 2013. As mentioned above, I could not accept Mr Loh’s account that an officer of IO Goh’s training and experience would have divulged Ms C’s and Ms W’s identities in their short conversations on 31 July 2013 and am formed the view that Mr Loh had inadvertently implicated himself when he attended before the investigation officer with the said images of the complainants.

398    Turning back to Mr Loh’s mustering of his athletes for help, while I would not expect a person accused of sexual crimes to display full equanimity about his situation, I found Mr Loh’s defensive conduct to be incongruous with an individual who had spent 37 years within a branch of the Disciplined Service of our nation. Mr Loh’s long tenure in the Prisons Service should have left him with every **_confidence_** that the case against him would have been fully and fairly investigated, and that he would be cleared **_if_** there was nothing to the allegations. His pre-emptive actions, which resulted in Ms M being at the receiving end of threats and inquiries for images sourced with a view to their presentation to the investigation officer for his bid to debunk allegations before these had been properly communicated to Mr Loh, did not reveal a man reposing any such confidence.

### No motive was ever articulated

399    Ultimately, the defence did not advance any compelling reason for Ms C to frame Mr Low with the serious allegation forming the bases of the two proceeded charges. The defence had made an early bid to show that Ms C had been disgruntled with her poor form, coming in last for an event on 3 March 2013. Counsel had a ‘_put_’ question to this effect[^370]:

>   
| 

Counsel:

 | 

Around 3rd of March 2013, after your competition that day, Mr. Loh said that you do not have the potential to be trained as a national athlete and had given up in training you. Do you agree?

 |
| 

Ms C:

 | 

I wouldn’t know. That’s him…

Oh it wasn’t made… known to me. Yah, he didn’t say it.

 |

  
  

400    By the time for final submissions to be tendered, the defence team had apparently abandoned this attempt to show disillusionment as a basis for Ms C turning against Mr Loh by the time of the final submissions. In any case, Ms C had from the evidence only become interested in sprinting events in JC1 and had been fairly successful at a Youth SEA Games event, She was nevertheless fairly sanguine about her lack of progress in 2013, and had never fixated on becoming a national athlete, according to Ms W, Ms C and her parents. Accordingly, DPP Gail Wong stated the following in her oral submissions[^371]:

> (T)he Defence has not even established that the victim has any motive to falsely implicate the accused… The evidence shows that the victim and PW4 were extremely reluctant to come forward to make the complaint against the accused. Even when the victim finally decided to, PW1, her father, also expressed great resistance himself and tried to persuade the victim to forgive the accused and not to do so. Such instances of their behaviour stand that any odds that the (_prosecution witnesses_) have a motive to incriminate the accused.

401    Defence counsels were clear that they were not making any concerted attempt to establish that Ms C had a motive to frame the accused, stating in their oral submissions[^372]:

> Prosecution have made quite a bit of a submission with regards to the fact that there is no motive on the part of the complainant. We have made it very clear from the inception, **_Defence is in no position to_** (**fathom**)[^373]**_whether there is a motive or not in our case_**…

402    Counsel instead quoted Quentin Loh J’s pronouncement in _Ong Mingwee (alias Wang Mingwei) v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGHC 244</span> (“ _Ong Mingwee_”) at \[69\] that “_The very fact that it is difficult to fathom why a person would cry rape is not, contrary to the findings of the DJ, evidence the Prosecution can rely on to help establish its case._” Counsel expressed her view that the prosecution should not be permitted to attempt to use the absence of motive to corroborate their case, given their burden to prove beyond reasonable doubt[^374]. With respect, I would observe that the situation in _Ong Mingwee_ to be starkly different from the present case. There, the prosecution’s case was floundering from the shaky testimonies of the complainant and another witness. In this instance, I have found both internal and external consistency in Ms C’s account, and thus the prosecution’s case was not in need of bolstering. It would however have helped the coherence of the defence case had there been a clearly articulable motive on the part of Ms C.

403    Counsel’s focus was, rather, that Ms C was an unreliable witness, and reiterated several aspects of Ms C’s intemperate text message expressing her contempt for rapist and perverts to illustrate how this was so.[^375] In this regard, I have already expressed my view that the _WhatsApp_ message was a cathartic release, and not indicative that the complainant had any mental or psychological condition which would have affected her reliability as a witness. In the instance where Ms C had echoed these views under cross-examination, I was of the view that this was again born from the frustration and strain of her prolonged stints of cross examination as a prosecution witness, which extended some five-and-a-half days of her nine days[^376] of testimony. While Ms C’s occasional episodes of abrasiveness and antagonism with counsel was unfortunate, this was not unexpected given that she was asked to revisit the instances of molest on multiple occasions. Counsel also contended that Ms C’s delay in reporting was unwarranted and she had not apprehended the seriousness of making such an allegation when she filed the police report on 30 July 2016.

## CONVICTION

404    I would not agree with counsel’s view in this regard, the evidence showed that Ms C had contemplated long and hard before filing the police report. I also accept that Ms C had reservations whether she would be believed because of the time that had elapsed between the asserted acts and the point where she had mustered the will and gumption to make her report with Ms W, for the primary reason of protecting other trainees.

405    In _Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy_ v _Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] SGHC 129</span>, VK Rajah (as he was then) had made an apt observation on the obligation of the prosecution to base its case on a structure of evidential proof rather than theorise on suspicion or conjecture[^377]:

> …(T)he principle of reasonable doubt connotes and conveys the gravity and weightiness that society equates with punishment. It would be wrong to visit the indignity and pain of punishment upon a person unless and until the Prosecution is able to dispel all reasonable doubts that the evidence (or lack thereof) may throw up. Therefore, **_it is crucial that the trial judge appreciate that inasmuch as fanciful conspiracy theories, often pleaded by the Defence, will not suffice to establish reasonable doubt, the Prosecution’s theory of guilt must be supportable by reference to evidence alone and not mere conjecture that seeks to explain away gaps in the evidence. Suspicion and conjecture can never replace proof._** ”

> \[Emphasis added\]

406    All considered, there were no gaps in the evidence for the prosecution’s case, and I was convinced that Ms C’s testimony, viewed against the backdrop of the corroborating testimonial and documentary evidence, and juxtaposed with the defence case, passed muster to meet the “_unusually convincing_” standard. Here the defence had completely failed in their _alibi_ defence. Accordingly, I found that the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt and found Mr Loh Siang Piow alias Loh Chan Pew to be guilty as charged, convicting him on both proceeded charges.

## SENTENCING

407    The starting point in sentencing for outrage of modesty cases would be to consider the sentencing framework given by the High Court in _Kunasekaran s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara_ v _Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 580</span> (“_Kunasekaran_”). This sentencing framework involved a two-step sentencing band approach set out by the Court of Appeal in _Ng Kean Meng Terence_ v _Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 449</span> (“_Terence Ng”_) for the purposes of sentencing for rape, which was modified by See Kee Oon J in _GBR_ v _Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 296</span> (“_GBR_”) for the purposes of sentencing for aggravated outrage of modesty under s 354(2) of the Penal Code, was adapted for simpliciter outrage of modesty cases. At \[46\]-\[49\] of _Kunasekaran_, Chan Seng Onn J (referencing Terence Ng) proposed:

> (a)    First, the court should identify under which band the offence in question falls within, having regard to the factors which relate to the manner and mode by which the _offence_ was committed as well as the harm caused to the victim (we shall refer to these as ‘offence-specific’ factors). Once the sentencing band, which defines the range of sentences which may _usually_ be imposed for a case with those offence-specific features, has been identified the court should then determine precisely where within that range the present offence falls in order to derive an ‘indicative starting point’, which reflects the intrinsic seriousness of the _offending act._

> (b)    Secondly, the court should have regard to the aggravating and mitigating factors which _are personal to the offender_ to calibrate the appropriate sentence for that offender. These ‘offender-specific’ factors relate to the offender’s particular personal circumstances and, by definition, _cannot_ be the factors which have already been taken into account in the categorisation of the offence. In exceptional circumstances, the court is entitled to move outside of the prescribed range for that band if, in its view, the case warrants such a departure.

> \[Emphasis in the original\]

408    In relation to step 1, the High Court established the following sentencing bands for s 354(1) Penal Code offences:

> a)     Band 1: less than 5 months’ imprisonment;

> b)     Band 2: 5 to 15 months’ imprisonment; and

> c)     Band 3: 15 to 24 months’ imprisonment.

409    In _Kunasekaran_, Chan Seng Onn J next referenced the sentencing bands in GBR[^378] and prescribed the characteristics of each of the bands[^379]:

> a)    Band 1: This includes cases that do not present any, or at most one, of the offence-specific factors, and typically involves cases that involve a fleeting touch or no skin-to-skin contact, and no intrusion into the victim’s private parts.

> b)    Band 2: This includes cases where two or more of the offence-specific factors present themselves. **_The lower end of the band involves cases where the private parts of the victim are intruded, but there is no skin-to-skin contact._** The higher end of the band involves cases where there is skin-to-skin contact with the victim’s private parts. **_It would also involve cases where there was the use of deception._**

> c)    Band 3: This includes cases where numerous offence specific factors present themselves, especially factors such as the exploitation of a particularly vulnerable victim, a serious abuse of a position of trust, and/or the use of violence or force on the victim.

> \[Emphasis added\]

### Prosecution’s position

410    The prosecution had for the first proceeded charge; MAC 904652/2017, recommended a sentence of “**_at least 10 months’ imprisonment_**” for his outrage of modesty of Ms C (whom I will now refer to as ‘the victim’ rather than ‘the complainant’ for this part, as I had convicted Mr Loh.).

411    For the second proceeded charge; MAC 904653/2017, which involved the more sustained outrage of modesty of the victim by rubbing her vulva region over her clothing with his digit on 15 March 2013, the prosecution had asked for a term of “**_at least 14 months’ imprisonment_**”. The prosecution has also advocated that the sentences run consecutively to amount to a global term of **_24 months’ imprisonment_**.

### Applying the sentencing framework

412    Returning to the framework set out in _Kunsekaran_, I will start with the offence-specific aggravating factors.

## OFFENCE SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS

### Degree of sexual exploitation

413    The consideration of degree of sexual exploitation would involve analysing the part the victim’s body intruded upon, along with how the offender had touched the victim and the duration of the offending conduct.[^380] In both charges, Mr Loh had been charged with making contact around the victim’s **_vulva_** region. This would anatomically involve an intrusion to Ms C private parts. The framework would place the offending at Band 2, even absent additional aggravating factors. Any touch around the vulva or vaginal region would amount to an intrusion to the most intimate part of a woman and would generally be considered more serious than contact of a victim’s breast region. This would apply even if the contact was **_over_** clothing. Incidentally _Kunasekaran_ involved contact around the clothed crotch of a young female, over her skirt, for about a minute, resulting in the offender receiving a sentence of **_eight_** months’ imprisonment, which was affirmed on appeal. In that case, Chan Seng Onn J expressed his view that there was a distinction between ‘_private parts_’ which encompassed a victim’s genitalia, with and more generic “groin” region. Chan J had considered the victim’s reference to the touching her groin[^381]to pertain to a more general area which did not necessarily include her private parts. Implicitly this would mean that a higher sentence might be mandated for cases where the victim had unequivocally stated that her private parts (such as the vulva in this case) had been intruded upon (at \[55\]).:

> The victim here merely alleged that the appellant had touched her _groin area_, as opposed to her private parts. This distinction matters because whereas the _private parts_ refer to the victim's genitalia _per se_, the _groin area_ is merely the junctional region between the abdomen and thigh, which includes the genitalia. In other words, if the victim's groin area is touched, it does not _ipso facto_ mean that her private parts have been intruded upon…

> \[Emphasis in the original\].

414    Given this, the present case, by the area intruded alone, is more serious that the violation in _Kunasekaran_. Ms C had been quite explicit that Mr Loh had touched her “_vagina_”[^382] while she had told her mother that Mr Loh had “_touched the private part and actually did something that triggers me_.”[^383] This was undoubtedly a reference to the contact in the second proceeded charge.

415    In relation to the nature and extent of the sexual contact, the first charge involved a stealthier contact for a duration of 5-10[^384] minutes, described as follows[^385]:

> Ms C: Just the normal rubbing to loosen your thighs kind of massage. It was just that his hand would unnecessarily go so high up and his thumb was just touching… me there multiple times. So it was like pretending as though part of the massage, had to go so high up that his hand would just like brush and then rub and then just like just, yah, just kept coming into contact (_with the vagina_) ...

> So his whole hand will be …be on my thighs and then his thumb will be and then because it was like from moving you like you move from the bottom of your thigh to the top of your thigh, so that kept repeating. And then every time he got to the top of my thigh, like sometimes, his like somehow, his like somehow, his thumb had to just …be in contact.

416    For the second proceeded charge Ms. C had again stated that Mr Loh had touched her “_vagina_”, [^386] over her _Nike_ brand compression tights and had intruded with both thumbs. This assault lasted for a longer duration of 10 to 15 minutes[^387] and Ms C recalled that it was “_just forceful and hard and just … continuing_” [^388]pressure. Ms C had squeezed her thighs to resist until she felt numb from her effort, but Mr Loh had persisted, telling her to “_relax_”. Ms C’s squeezing of her thighs had only allowed an up and down motion from Mr Loh’s thumbs. The victim had been subject to such prolonged and sustained tactile pressure that she had experienced what she later learnt (from Mr A) to be an involuntary orgasm.

417    Mr Loh’s offending was thus more prolonged than _Kunsekaran_ in the two instances stated above. I would agree with the prosecutions characterisation of the level of sexual exploitation of the victim to be respectively be at the “_moderate to high range_”[^389] where the sentence ought (all other things being equal) exceed the eight months imposed against _Kunasekaran_ for the minute-long intrusion around the skirted victim’s clothed crotch .

### Circumstances of the offence

418    Ms C would not be considered a typical vulnerable victim. She was, nevertheless, at 18 years of age, academically brilliant but sexually naïve, having been brought up in a conservative and heavily religiously observant background. She was thus particularly susceptible to the influence of Mr Loh and the deceptions he had perpetrated in the course of the commission of the offences. Mr Loh had of course been highly recommended by Ms Eng and possessed an exceptional track record for grooming young athletic aspirants to sporting excellence. He had been introduced by Ms Eng on the grand premise that “_he was a very great coach; he was coaching national athletes and it was supposed to be a good privilege to train under him._”[^390] Mr Loh also combined his style of deep personal engagement with a training persona that was **_both_** authoritative and authoritarian to create a devoted cadre of trainees who admired and respected him. Mr Loh’s credentials included his sporting success from the 1973 SEAP Games and his high office in the Singapore Athletic Association.

419    This had resulted in Ms C reposing an extraordinary gratitude that he had taken her under his wing, along with an unquestioning trust that everything Mr Loh did was invariably to help her achieve her potential. There was a measure of cultivation by Mr Loh, who had (according to her) taken Ms C to meet his friends, help him draft testimonials, attended communal meals and celebratory events, and even bought her a pair of sprinting spikes.

### Premeditation by the accused

420    Given her wholehearted conviction of Mr Loh’s benign intentions Ms C was thus especially susceptible to the closely premeditated bid by Mr Loh to arrange the individual trainings as a vehicle to facilitate the commission of the offences. The evidence shows a determined **_effort_** by Mr Loh to carve out timings for the individual training sessions, which required deliberate effort given his heavy schedule as a school trainer for CHIJ (Toa Payoh), CJC and the NTU cadre, with the coterminous group trainings for private athletes who could join in the weekday school sessions from 3.30pm to 5.00pm. Mr Loh was only truly free on Sundays and Friday afternoons (as CHIJ Toa Payoh had shifted their training day from Friday to Tuesday) during the first quarter of 2013. While the sequence of events has been set out in detail earlier in these grounds, I will give a short outline to **_reconstruct_** what the body of evidence showed to have occurred, to underscore the **_level_** of effort Mr Loh took to organise the four sessions to afford an appreciation of the extent of premeditation undertaken.

#### Scheduling the first training session on 17 February 2013, which ended as an individual session

421    Mr Loh had started by messaging Mr Eugene Tan on Saturday, 16 February 2013, of his proposal for a three-person group training, Mr Tan had messaged Mr Oon Kuan Yong at 11.16 am to tell him that Mr Loh had arranged such a session for them adding “ _and_ (Ms C) _too_” at the tail-end of his message. Ms C had directly received a message “_Hey_ (Ms C) _Mr Loh called me to tell you tomorrow’s training is 3 pm at Tampiness_(sic). _So see you there_?”. Ms C had affirmed in the positive and indicated that Mr Loh had also **_directly_** called her[^391], suggesting that he had been especially interested to have her attend the session.

422    The grouping seemed peculiar as Mr Eugene Tan and Mr Oon Kuan Yong ran longer distances than Ms C, who was a sprinter. They had likely trained separately, causing Ms C to not even be able to recall if she had been alone for the duration of what she regarded as the first **_individual_** training session. She did have a lingering doubt about this, stating that she had “_probably_” warmed up alone. The evidence does suggest that by 6.07 pm, Mr Tan was no longer in Tampines Stadium, as evidenced by his text message exchange with Ms C. Mr Loh had ended the session with just Ms C, and then proposed his cool down massage. Nothing untoward had happened in this instance but Ms C had been introduced to, and familiarised with, his brand of massage which entailed her lying in a prone position and Mr Loh applying the ostensible therapy on her calves.

#### Planning for the second individual training session on 24 February 2013

423    For the second session, Mr Loh had specifically told Ms that she would have a session, and this had been undertaken despite the date; Sunday, 24 February 2013, being _Chap Goh Meh._ While he would be obliged to assist in marketing in the morning and would entertain relatives for the customary ancestral prayers and feasting in the evening, Mr Loh would nevertheless have a segment of time in the late-morning to mid-afternoon to undertake the session, which he had scheduled at Tampines Stadium, just one MRT stop from Pasir Ris. In this session, Mr Loh had gone further to intrude into Ms C’s vaginal area while ostensibly massaging her thighs. This had lasted 5-10 minutes, and Ms C had apprehended about five separate intrusions in that period, but his movements had been so furtive and ambiguous that Ms C, who at this stage had still held Mr Loh to high regard, been inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt on account that he was old and clumsy, and thus might have fumbled while massaging her.

#### The third individual training session on 10 March 2013

424    For the third session Mr Loh had attended the _Venus Run_ in the morning of Sunday, 10 March 2013, but had met Ms C and her father at Tampines Stadium, where the session was interrupted by rain, as documented in a meteorological report[^392] showing 35 minutes of rain between 5.00pm -6.00pm, and another 10 minutes in the hour thereafter.

#### Premeditation for the fourth training session on 15 March 2013

425    The fourth training session on Friday 15 March 2013 was the most closely premeditated event. There had been no school training as CHIJ (Toa Payoh) had shifted the formal training day to Tuesday, and the school staff would, in any case, be engaged in parent-teacher meetings that Friday, and preparing for the World Water Day walk the next day. There was thus some uncertainty, which had led at least three athletes (Mr Toh Wee Hong, Mr Tan Tze Jung and Ms C) to wonder if there would be training that day.

426    To recapitulate, Mr Toh Wee Hong had messaged Ms C to check with her, and Ms C had returned with a response of “_Tampines !!_”. Both Mr Tan Tze Jung and Mr Toh Wee Hong had been told to take a rest. Mr Tan was told explicitly: “_Take a break today, I have mee_(t_)ing_”[^393] and Mr Toh had taken his cue telling Ms C “:( _I’m not going, Cause he_ (Mr Loh) _said ntu boys today don’t need to come_.”[^394] Implicitly, given that Mr Toh had prefaced his message with a sad-faced emoticon, Mr Toh had wanted to train but been **_told not to_**. This left an anomalous situation where all the other trainees had been suggestively asked not to turn up for training, even where at least two of the ‘NTU boys” were keen to train.

427    It is telling that Ms C was not given the same discouragement. From the messages, Mr Loh had set up the training event in Tampines Stadium to be an individual event, featuring just one trainee: Ms C herself. Mr Loh had essentially leveraged his influence to “suggest” that his other private athletes not turn up at Tampines, and this fact was only obvious to Ms C with Mr Toh Wee Hong’s message at 3.34pm on 15 March 2013. The above thus would show that Mr Loh’s offending was **_not_** the **_opportunistic_** caress or grope by an impulsive commuter in an MRT train as was the case in _Kunasekaran_, but a studied plan to lull Ms C and progressively have her familiarised to situations where she would be alone with Mr Loh, accept his massages and then execute his plan to have his way with her after she had lain prone on a massage bed in the secluded location of the equipment room. While the fact of molestation in an MRT train was the principal aggravating factor in _Kunasekaran_, Mr Loh’s **_premeditation_** and **_deception_** (which is specifically referenced as a determining criteria for sentencing at the higher level of the spectrum of band 2 offending) would be the pre-eminent aggravating factors in Mr Loh’s case.

### Sentencing in other post-Kunasekaran cases

428    I will now turn to the factual matrices and sentences imposed in several post-Kunasekaran cases to afford an insight on how the considerations stated would translate to the actual tariff. In Public _Prosecutor v Rakesh Kumar Prasad_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGMC 35</span> (“_Rakesh_”), the accused, a yoga teacher, aged 26 had been convicted after trial for, _inter alia_, molesting his 25-year-old female yoga student by pinching her left upper breast and touching her left breast by slipping his left hand inside her sport brassiere within a single yoga session. Mr Rakesh’s appeal against conviction was dismissed on appeal and his first instance sentence of nine months’ imprisonment for the outrage of modesty charge was titrated upwards to **_12 months’ imprisonment_** and caning of three strokes. As a juxtaposition to the present case, there had been skin-to-skin contact in one instance in _Rakesh_ when the offender slipped his hand to caress the victim’s breast. This would be counterbalanced by the accepted principle that an intrusion on a victim’s vulva would be more serious than contact on the breast. Mr Rakesh, like Mr Loh, had no criminal antecedents: _Public Prosecutor v QO_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] SGDC 250</span>.

#### Case of PP v Seah Hua Sheng

429    In _Public Prosecutor v Seah Hua Sheng_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGMC 8</span>, the accused; a personal trainer, aged 31, had molested a potential student by grabbing her left breast for a duration of some three seconds, under the pretext of his undertaking a physical examination of the victim for fitness assessment to ascertain her composition of muscle mass against body fat. The accused there had claimed trial. The parallels in that case with the instant matter included Mr Seah taking advantage of his profession as a fitness trainer and using deception to convince the victim to enter his apartment where she was molested. Given the alleged _modus operandi_, premeditation was asserted. The prosecution there had asserted that Mr Seah had cast baseless and insulting allegations against the victim by suggesting that she had contrived the allegations in a bid to blackmail him, and not demonstrated any remorse on the basis that he had claimed trial and thus necessitated the victim having to relive the incident and endure cross-examination. Mr Seah’s mitigation principally emphasised his testimonials and commendations for charitable contributions and for his work done as a police officer. He had also received testimonials.

430    In this case, both Mr Seah and the prosecution filed appeals against the sentence of **_nine months’_** imprisonment imposed at the first instance. The sentence was affirmed by Chan Seng Onn J in the High Court on 30 June 2017.

#### Case of Public Prosecutor v Othman bin Jamal

431     _In Public Prosecutor v Othman bin Jamal_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGMC 62</span> (“_Othman_”), the offender was a Singaporean aged 49, who had pleaded guilty to having fondled a 17-year-old victim’s right breast **_over her clothes_**, while she was sleeping, and then kissed her on the lips when she opened her eyes. The offender had initially claimed trial but decided to plead guilty before the close of the prosecutions’ case but after the victim had testified.

432    In that case, at the first instance, the District Judge was not entirely in agreement with the prosecution’s submission that the degree of intrusion was high. The prosecution’s characterisation in this regard had been premised upon the accused’s admission in the Statement of Facts, which was drafted to include his “_fondling the right nipple of_ (the victim’s) _right breast over her clothes_”[^395] and _fondling_ (the victim’s) _right breast by fiddling her nipple_”.[^396] This differed from the victim’s actual sworn evidence in court, which was that she felt someone pressing on her breast **_near_** her nipple. The judge also noted the victim’s recollection that the touch was “_very brief_”. Further, the judge noted the charge, too, did not reflect that the accused had fondled or otherwise manipulated the victim’s nipple. She had thus given the accused the benefit of the doubt in relation to the offender touching the victim’s nipple and imposed a term of three months’ imprisonment.

433    On appeal before Chan Seng Onn J, the accused’s three-month imprisonment was enhanced to **_nine months’_** imprisonment. It should be noted that when the appeal was heard, Chan J had already decided the case in _Kunasekaran_, and hence the nine-month imprisonment sentence would have entailed Chan J’s deliberations to derive a penalty which must be deemed to be consonant with the (then) newly formulated _Kunasekaran_ sentencing framework. The implications of this would be that _Othman_ must stand as appellate authority that the tariff of nine months’ imprisonment could also extend to cases where the offence-specific factors would include intrusion over the **_clothed private parts_** of victims.

The only other offence-specific factors to take note of in _Othman_ was the fact that he had also briefly kissed the victim, and that the victim had been in a vulnerable position for exploitation as she was asleep when the molestation began. This of course would also be true for the instant case, given that Ms C had assumed the prone position while being massaged when the assaults were perpetrated on her. While Mr Othman had antecedents, none were similar in nature. He was thus hardly worse than Mr Loh, who had no criminal antecedents, in this area of offender-specific considerations. For both proceeded charges, Mr Loh’s offending was relatively more serious in terms of duration and intensity, as well as the fact that his intrusions onto Ms C’s clothed **_vulva_** would, by their nature, be more egregious than the contact on the victim’s clothed **_breast_** in _Othman_.

#### Case of Public Prosecutor v Chan Cheng

In _Public Prosecutor_ v _Chan Cheng_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 245</span> (“_Chan Cheng”_), the accused had been convicted after a trial on five charges of outrage of modesty committed at the Guillemard Camp, in 1999, having fled from justice and remained at large for some 17 years. The accused had been a psychology lecturer at the National University of Singapore (NUS). And been engaged by a school to prepare and present a programme for the three-day the camp and had slept a bunk together with the secondary-one students. The accused had molested 12 students in all, but the prosecution had proceeded with five charges. The acts of molestation involved his fondling the private parts of the male students, in separate instances, over clothing and with skin-to-skin contact. The accused received sentences of ten months’ imprisonment for the outrages of modesty over clothing and 14 months’ imprisonment when he had made skin contact with the victims’ private parts. His appeals against conviction and sentence were dismissed in March 2020. Chan Cheng’s case is salient to the instant case as some of the charges involved contact on clothed genitals, with the parallel situation that the offences were committed by an instructor and authority figure. The affirmation on appeal of the sentence of ten months’ imprisonment for the acts of molestation performed over clothing, reinforces the point that intrusions to the genital area are regarded with especial gravity in sentencing, whether they ate committed over or under the victim’s garments.

### Harm caused to the victim

434     There is no doubt in my mind that Ms C suffered from considerable emotional and psychological trauma as a consequence of the both the sexual assaults and the aftermath. I accept that the victim has been subject to a degree of re-traumatisation as a result of her having to give her account over her nine days in court, with five-and-a-half days devoted to cross-examination. In her court testimony, she attested to it being hard for her to come to terms with what had happened, and that she could not make sense of her situation, as she had trusted him as a coach and Mr Loh seemed to be “_a good person_”[^397]. I would thus broadly agree with the following characterisation offered by the prosecution in their sentencing submissions:

> 26    Ms. C suffered at the very least, a moderate degree of psychological harm as a result of the offender’s intrusions to her body. Apart from her initial confusion after the incident in (_the second charge_), the offender’s sexual assault of Ms. C left her feeling, by her own testimony, “_very, very, very, very dirty…so grossed_ \[and\] _confused_” for “_quite long_” and she “_spent that whole week crying_” as she tried to make sense of her feelings of being “dirty” and the offender’s behaviour of nothing having happened. The psychological harm was compounded by his betrayal of trust…

### PW3’s victim impact statement

435    Ms C authored a poignant victim impact statement which was read out prior to the pronouncement of Mr Loh’s sentence. An extract of parts which were salient to sentencing is set out below:

> “Your Honour, when the incident itself took place more than 7 years ago, I felt violated, dirty and very confused as to how someone I respected and trusted could do something like that. It took a while but I distanced myself from him and moved on with my life. I felt speaking up was the right thing to do so that he would be aware the victims speak up and hence dare not anyone else. I expected that there would be little chance for anything to be done about it. As I felt that there was no evidence to prove anything anyway but I never imagined that this would turn into such a nightmare that he would insist on going to trial. I was not prepared for this to drive on for the next 4 years of my life. … **_I had to endure the humiliation of having my identity revealed extensively to people that I have previously trained with._** They only listened to his version of the story and concluded that I was a liar. He spread, Ms. W’s and my names around in his attempt to discredit us and worm his way out of admitting guilt and fake innocence and I could not do anything about it. **_I regret not protecting myself but privatising my social media photos and naively wanting to believe better of friends even when they posted their support of him online. I was not prepared for them to download my Facebook, Instagram photos to use as his evidence_** and only realised the extent of it 1½ years too late in Court. **_It was painful to see my own track teacher, Michelle Eng whom I trusted, share my cheerleading photos with him as evidence implying that I was a wild person who was okay with being touched. It has turned me into a super paranoid person and I now live with a constant fear that people can easily circulate my name and photos and humiliate me online_**. …

> There are still people who continue to blindly support him and although it’s easy to say that it’s not my job to convince them, it’s tough to see people trash me online and not be able to do anything about it. I don’t know how much my reputation would have been tarnished if I’ve not managed to find any concrete evidence to support myself. … I really hope more can be done to protect victims of sexual assault to speak up. … I feel like I got assaulted and then paid the price for speaking up. I really hope he gets the maximum penalty punished possible to more than pay the price I paid going through this traumatising experience. Throughout this process, Alan Khor and Gail Wong showed me genuine care and concern and fought hard for the case. They do their jobs with real empathy for people and I’m very grateful to them. I also like to thank, Your Honour, for showing compassion during Court and for the fair conviction. I never expected this outcome considering that it happened so many years ago and I’m really proud of the Singapore Police Force.”

## OFFENDER SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS

### Mitigation plea

436    Counsel Victor Lee described Mr. Loh as an upright member of society, and public servant, having been awarded the Efficiency Medal by President Devan Nair in 1984. Mr Loh had served in public service for 37 years in the Prisons Service and had no criminal antecedents. Counsel had asked the court to consider that Mr Loh had suffered professionally given the length of the trial and that had been charged in 2017, Mr Loh has also been placed in financial straits from defending the case.

437    Counsel had also referenced that 89 sets of testimonials amassed by the defence team to demonstrate the full extent of Mr Loh’s contributions. Many of the testimonials indicated that Mr Loh had played a significant role in their lives, with a number describing him as a “_father/grandfather_” figure. Mr Lee also read our passages from a few of the large number of testimonials, which extolled Mr Loh’s achievements, high sense of morality and determination to support justice and fairness, with integrity to take deserved punishment, but an equal resolve to stand up for himself if unfairly accused. The contributors to the body of testimonials included Ms Amirah Aljunied and fellow members of the CHIJ Toa Payoh track relay team; Ms Pebbles Lee and Ms Alexandra Louise Wee. A number of the contributing individuals affirmed their personal belief that Mr Loh would not have committed the offences he was convicted for.

438    Counsel urged the court to consider that Mr Loh was at “_an advanced age_” of 75, his “_hitherto unblemished reputation as a pillar of and contributor to the sporting community_”, and that he had suffered from “_certain health conditions_”.[^398] To this end, counsel referred to a medical report[^399] from Dr Chai Ping, a Senior Consultant at the National University Heart Centre, Singapore’s Department of Cardiology. Dr Chai stated that Mr Loh had chronic atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, gout, cervical spine degeneration, past haemorrhoids, and past ventricular systolic dysfunction.

439    I did note that Mr Loh’s most concerning condition of left ventricular systolic condition was in respect of an episode in 2000, where his ejection fraction was at an abnormal 35%, and attributed to atrial fibrillation. Dr Chai’s report showed that his condition had stabilised, with his last attendance for this condition in 2003 showed a normal ventricular function, and an ejection fraction of 50%. Mr Loh’s hypertension was well controlled with medication where his last clinical reading on 6 April 2020 showed 140/83 mmHg mercury, and his hyperlipidaemia was also manged with statins. Mr Loh was also medicated with nebivolol and warfarin for his chronic atrial fibrillation.

440    DPP Gail Wong informed the court that she had inquired with Prisons authorities and been assured that the medical services would be adequate and competent to treat Mr Loh’s stated medical conditions. A message from Dr Yeo Kuang Lim from their medical operations department states:

> Singapore Prisons Service has had experience dealing with inmates with a variety of medical conditions.

> Singapore Prison Service has adequate system of healthcare in place to manage the Accused should the accused be admitted to prison and to ensure that the accused’s health would not be adversely affected as a result of the incarceration.

> All prison inmates are given the appropriate level of medical care and treatment as may be required, including referral to a restructured hospital for treatment and management of serious medical conditions.

> Thank you.

> Dr Yeo Kuang Lim

> Assistant Director (Med Ops)

> Frontline Operations Branch

> Operations Division

### Defence’s sentencing recommendations

441    Mr Lee urged the court to consider that Mr Loh’s offending to be at the lower end of Band 1 of the _Kunasekaran_ sentencing framework in this case, with a recommendation of five months’ imprisonment, or a “**_maximum 6 months”_** as this was an instance of light pressure applied with no skin-to-skin contact. Mr Lee also advocated a term of seven to ten months’ imprisonment for the second charge and took the view that both sentences ought to run concurrently given “_totality principles and given all the relevant mitigating factors_”.

### Lack of remorse

442    There was yet another area of difference between the prosecution and the defence. Counsel had argued against the DPPs' characterisation that the manner Mr Loh conducted his defence showed a lack of remorse. DPP Gail Wong had also inveighed against Mr Loh’s **_earlier_** conduct in almost immediately telling his trainees once he had found out about the police report against him. The learned DPP characterised Mr Loh’s conduct to amount to “victim shaming” stating:

> 31    The offender patently shows no remorse for molesting Ms. C. First, he revealed Ms. C’s identity to other athletes without reservation from the point when he knew of a report against him, effectively “victim-shaming” her from the start of police investigations, and rendering any subsequent gag orders redundant. By his own admission, he identified the victim to his close private athletes and even others such as (Ms S and Ms T), who never even trained with the victim. Her identity spread within the close-knit athletics community, causing her distress. The victim was visibly upset when she testified that because the offender told others, everyone knew what happened to her. The victim was ostracised simply for standing up to the offender's sexual abuse.

443    There was a measure of validity in DPP Wong’s assertions. The learned DPP referred to _Public Prosecutor v BNO_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 243</span>, which involved sexual crimes committed against a nine-year-old boy by who had been the accused’s son’s classmate, during sleepovers at the accused’s residence. The High Court had emphasized the accused’s conduct at trial, where See Kee Oon J, in drawing the connection between a brazenly conducted defence and evidence of lack of remorse, had held [^400]:

> …(T)he Accused’s lack of remorse was apparent from the bold and extravagant manner in which he chose to conduct his defence. He engaged in victim shaming tactics to portray the Victim as a hyper-sexualised boy who had fabricated or imagined the sexual acts due to his alleged “familiarity with sexual matters” He made numerous spurious allegations in a bid to discredit the victim. This was clearly aggravating and I took this into account in arriving at the appropriate indicative starting sentence…

444    Counsel Victor Lee had decried the learned DPPs description of Mr Loh’s defence and conduct during the investigation on such terms, arguing that the accused was merely exercising his right of trial. The evidence of Ms C’s cheerleading and other images had been sourced to rebut the victim’s account that she was wearing compression tights, and hence images showing her wearing shorts or shorts with tights would be relevant. The non-sporting images would also help to show that Ms C maintained friendly ties with Mr Loh to the extent of his receiving birthday wishes from her in November 2013. Counsel also contended that Ms Eng’s views were her own, and Mr Loh should not be held accountable for them.

445    While not undertaken at such an extreme level as the accused in _BNO_, there were aspects of what might have fallen under the description of “_bold and extravagant conduct_” on the part of Mr Loh both within the pretrial period, and during the course of the trial itself. To be clear, I considered Mr Loh claiming trial to be a **_neutral_** factor, as he patently had a right to trial, and would merely lose any entitlement to a discount attendant on a plea of guilt. It was however the case that major aspects of his defence were never fleshed out, much less objectively established. The most obvious would be the allegation of collusion where Mr Loh had claimed that Ms C and Ms W had been influenced by persons whom he had identified to be his rivals within the Singapore Athletic Association; Mr William Wong, Mr James Wong and Mr Fabian William to frame him with accusations of sexual assault. This had been abandoned completely by the defence, and there had been no references to this facet of his case at the time of the final submissions on 11 March 2020. This was not without cost to Ms C, as Mr Loh’s insinuation of a conspiracy against him by rival Singapore Athletic Association members would have galvanised support around Mr Loh, and added hostility against Ms C (and incidentally, Ms W too). This would have potentiated the alienation Ms C described as she became estranged from fellow trainees whom she had previously befriended and bonded with, given her tainting as an instrument of a rival “camp” to damage Mr Loh.

### Repeated attempts to use images to show that victim “did not behave like a victim” amount to harassment.

446    A more egregious aspect would be the defence’s repeated attempts to inveigle the admission of images taken from social media platforms such as _Instagram_ and _Facebook_ in a bid to frame Ms C as an individual whose appearance and activities somehow failed to conform to the defence’s view of that of a person who had faced sexual assault. The learned DPP had pointed to Ms Eng’s unflagging attempts to admit the image of Ms C in cheerleading practice, which started with a bid to offer the image to the investigation officer and culminated in a final attempt when she presented her testimony in court. Even without the guidance of _CGK_, it should have been obvious that mental or psychological scars, or the absence thereof, cannot be discerned from isolated snapshots, more so from an image taken in 2017, after some four years had elapsed from the material time.

447    I would think that it fairly obvious that the **_external manifestation_** of injuries to the **_psyche_** would differ from **_physical injuries_**. Hence, while it would be legitimate to question if a plaintiff in a personal injury claim involving physical injuries such as severe leg and spinal injuries and caught subsequently executing a _pirouette_ in ballet practice, is a fraud, it would be a specious and cynical exercise to take a snapshot of a putative victim at a recreational or social activity to weave a narrative that her claim of sexual assault was a mere pretence. In her victim impact statement, Ms C had stated that the pillaging and collation of images from her social media from persons she trusted had resulted in her developing an anxious and fearful mentality akin to a state of paranoia.

### Ex-tempore sentencing remarks

448    Upon the conclusion of submissions, I issued the following sentencing remarks which would encapsulate my views on sentence (reproduced from the fifth paragraph as \[1\] to \[4\] merely set out the background of the case):

> \[1\]-\[4\] …

> 5    To recap, the first massage had been uneventful with violations occurring at the second event, when Ms C experienced Mr Loh brushing and rubbing against her vulva over her clothing repeatedly in a touch-and-go fashion as he massaged her. Her initial reaction was to suppress her alarm and to try to give her coach the benefit of the doubt that the contact was accidental from manual clumsiness, as a result of his age. She had thus not discontinued their association and continued with these private sessions. Ms C had however taken her father along on a subsequent session as a prophylaxis of sorts to guard against any intrusions. She had let her guard down when nothing untoward occurred then, and the session, which was witnessed by father, had been truncated because of rain at Tampines Stadium. The subsequent massage had been in such circumstances which left no room for doubt as to the act being perpetrated.

> 6    This session had occurred in Tampines Stadium, which was the venue of the other private sessions. Mr Loh had led Ms C to an equipment room and used a massage bed for the massage. The contact in where in the course of the massage, he rubbed Ms C’s vulva over her clothing, as the DPP described “_with such pressure and persistence that she experienced what she eventually believed to be an orgasm_”. I should add that the victim, while 18 years old, was sexually naïve, having been in a cloistered social environment and attended an all-girls school. Ms C had been perplexed and bewildered and had only come to understand what happened to her in a subsequent communication with a platonic male friend. The phenomenon of a forced or involuntary orgasm as a psychological reaction is a medically known phenomenon.

> 7    There is no doubt that Ms C had suffered considerable psychological trauma and had reported the offences only in 2016 when she was concerned that Mr Loh might be given more trainees from her old school. Unfortunately, this trauma was exacerbated by the fact that she had been subjected to close cross examination for five-and-a half days as the accused had claimed trial. There had also been an aspect of _‘victim shaming’_ in the manner that her identity had been revealed among trainees at the point that investigations had commenced in 2016, and also with material having been gathered into a dossier of sorts to discredit her, including pictures of her at cheerleading practice in 2017. I note the angst of Ms C in the manner that Ms Michelle Eng, her teacher in school, had turned against her. For a balanced perspective, I fully acknowledge the Defence’s right to mount a full and effective defence. I do note however that many of the images seem to be attempts to discredit or embarrass Ms C, as these deal with tangential events and matters which have little value in establishing innocence (or rather absence of evidence of guilt) or in determining sentence. Many of the group pictures of Ms C in social events and outdoor activities have little bearing on a case which is fundamentally built on Mr Loh having an alibi on the projected dates of the private training sessions, and that the events complained thus never happened.

> 8     **_There was a deeply egregious abuse of trust here. Young trainees are placed in the care of coaches with the legitimate expectation by the trainees, their parents and the public at large that they will be protected from harm or exploitation. It is clear that the Court must take a firm stand against offences committed against young persons who are placed in vulnerable situations where they may be susceptible to sexual exploitation or violation by the very persons entrusted with their welfare_**.

> 9    To be fair to Mr Loh, I see two different aspects of the man, now aged 75. From the mitigation plea, Mr Loh has a loyal and devoted following of persons who have benefitted from his instruction, association and friendship. I acknowledge that Mr Loh, by all appearance, has been a dedicated coach and is sincere in his desire to promote athletics in Singapore. From the accounts which I accept as genuine testimonials, Mr Loh has done much to earn his standing in the athletic community.

> 10    The other aspect of Mr Loh is, however, the principal business of this Court. This is that the Prosecution has proven, over a 27-day trial, that despite his salutary contributions and public persona of dedication to sporting excellence, he has a darker side. Mr Loh is not beyond taking the opportunity afforded by the high regard to his coaching work, exploiting the innocence of at least one young athlete he was entrusted to coach, and visiting the two acts of molestation he was convicted for. In relation to the offending, I agree with the characterisation by the prosecution that there was clear premeditation and devious planning by the offender to sexually violate his young charge, betraying her trust and abusing his authority as a coach to do so. While already 18 years old, Ms C should count as such a vulnerable victim, given that she had been as unschooled in carnal or sexual matters as to have to be told by her friend that her experience, as described in the second charge, appeared to have been a spontaneous orgasm. **_This does point to the fact that the second sentence must be significantly heavier than the first charge, given that this involved a comparatively prolonged event; extensive and repetitive intrusion of the victim’s vaginal area and is a clear escalation from the degree and manner of touch exhibited in the first charge._**

> 11    In sentencing, I note the consensus between Prosecution and Defence that Mr Loh’s offending falls within the second level of _Kunasekaran._ Notably, there was no skin-to-skin contact here, as the offences had involved pressure against the sporting fabric Ms C wore. The contact was however prolonged, especially in the second instance.

> 12    I do note Mr Loh’s age and his conditions of hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, cardiac rhythm problems and lower back pain. I am, however, confident that prison medical services will afford him a high standard of care to manage these conditions.

### Basis for individual sentences and consecutive sentencing

449    All considered, it was clear that in analogous precedent cases, the High Court had in _Othman_ and _Seah Hua Sheng_ endorsed a sentence of nine months’ imprisonment for a short duration contact over a clothed breast, and also a sentence of ten months’ imprisonment for contact over the clothed genital area in _Chan Cheng_. It therefore appeared that the **_ten-month_** imprisonment recommendation for the first charge was entirely appropriate. I should add that while the offender in _Kunasekaran_ received an eight-month term for contact over the victim’s clothed genital area, the offending involved contact against two layers of clothing, the instant case involved furtive contact over one layer of stretched fabric, being Ms C’s running tights. While the first charge would be around the **_moderate_** end of Band 2 of the _Kunasekaran_ framework, Mr Loh’s offending for the second charge would, in my view, be at the **_extreme_** end of Band 2 of which spanned from five months’ to 15 months’ imprisonment. It was patent that it would have been difficult to ascertain exactly how **_long_** the contact had lasted (although the victim had asked Mr Loh to stop after 10-15 seconds of his rubbing motion), or how much pressure Mr Loh used for the victim to have experienced the involuntary or forced orgasm. The former is a given, as it would have been difficult for a victim in such a situation to precisely mark the passage of time, and latter because there is inevitably some variance among individuals in respect of physiological reactions of this nature. I would note that Ms C had heard Mr Loh tell her to “_just relax_” despite her entreaties. She had resisted by tightening her thighs, and Mr Loh had persisted with his actions undeterred by her resistance. Given this, as well as the other offence-specific and offender-specific factors mentioned above, I did not find the prosecution’s recommendation of 14 months’ imprisonment for the second charge to be excessive.

450    The prosecution had argued for the two sentences to run **_consecutively_**, which would have led to an aggregate global sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment. I found the submission for consecutive sentencing to be a valid proposition given the **_three-week_** interval between the time of the first (24 February 2013) and the second (15 March 2013) offence. These were on the facts, plainly separate transactions. In _Public Prosecutor_ v _Law Aik Meng_, <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGHC 33</span> VK Rajah J (as he then was) had cited the need for offences of the same nature to be committed within a short space of time to be considered to be within the same transaction, as a prerequisite for consideration to be sentenced concurrently[^401]:

> The one-transaction rule requires that where two or more offences are committed in the course of a single transaction, all sentences in respect of those offences should be concurrent rather than consecutive…Prof Andrew Ashworth in Sentencing and Criminal Justice \[Cambridge University Press, 2005, 4th Ed\] at p 245 interpreted the _raison d’être_ for the ‘single transaction’ principle in terms of proximity in time and proximity in type of offence. Such an interpretation was also adopted by Dr D A Thomas in Principles of Sentencing (Heinemann, 2nd Ed, 1979) (‘Principles of Sentencing’), who opined at p 54:

>> The concept of “single transaction” may be held to cover a sequence of offences involving a repetition of the **_same behaviour_** towards the **_same victim_** … provided the offences are committed **_within a relatively short space of time. …_**

> \[Emphasis in the original\]

451    While the defence had asked for the terms to run concurrently, I was of the view that this would militate against this well-established sentencing principle. An equally pertinent consideration would be the concern of a **_dilution_** of the deterrent effect, as concurrent sentencing would mean that **_no_** price was exacted for the earlier criminal act. The fact remained that, along with the stated aggravating factors mentioned, there had been a clearly exponential escalation between the first and second molestations, and a concurrent sentence would simply not have served the ends of justice.

### Considerations of Totality and Proportionality

452    Notwithstanding this, I was mindful of the need to ensure that the Totality Principle was closely adhered to. This Totality Principle was articulated by Menon CJ in _Logachev Vladislav_ v _Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 12</span> where his Honour stated at \[84\]:

> As to the content of the totality principle, this comprises two limbs. **_The first examines whether the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed, while the second considers whether the effect of the aggregate sentence on the offender is crushing and not in keeping with his past record and his future prospects_** (see _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam_ v PP <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> (“_Shouffee_”) at \[54\] and \[57\] respectively). It has been said that the totality principle is one of limitation and is a manifestation of the requirement of proportionality that runs through the gamut of sentencing decisions (see _Shouffee_ at \[47\]).

> \[Emphasis added\]

453    The High Court in _Public Prosecutor_ v _Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 148</span>, had enjoined a sentencing court to be on guard to note[^402] “_an aggregation resulting in a longer sentence is going to carry a compounding effect that bears more than a linear relation to the cumulative and overall criminality of the case_”. Essentially, I took this to be an instruction for a sentencing court to guard against the imposition of a global sentence which would be unduly harsh where two (or more) fairly long sentences were ‘stacked’ together.

454    Looking at the facts, while I agreed that the prosecution’s sentencing recommendation were well-articulated and sound, I noted that the aggregated global sentence would run two _Kunasekaran_ Band 2 sentences end-to-end, with a fairly heavy resultant sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment. I considered that Mr Loh would face separate and distinct punishments for **_both_** proceeded charges in the instant case, and there were no stood down charges that needed to be taken into consideration (TIC) at the tranche of the case that was before me. I was therefore of the view that a minor recalibration would be desirable to derive a global sentence which, while addressing his offending conduct, was not crushing, and was in keeping with Mr Loh’s past record and future prospects.

### Sentences imposed

455    After moderating the global sentence applying a ‘_last look_’ titration to ensure adherence to the Totality Principle and proportionality in consecutive sentencing, Mr Loh was accordingly sentenced as follows:

> 1    MAC-904652-2017 Section 354(1) Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008): **_Eight (8) months' imprisonment._**

> 2    MAC-904653-2017 Section 354(1) Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008) **_Thirteen (13) months' imprisonment_**.

> The sentences were ordered to run consecutively to yield an aggregate global sentence of 21 months’ imprisonment.

### Present status of accused

Mr Loh Siang Piow remains on bail pending the conclusion of his appeal against conviction and sentence. I am given to understand that PTC sessions are being convened in respect of the three pending charges concerning Ms W.
