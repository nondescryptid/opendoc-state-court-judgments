### District Judge Kaur Jasvender:

1       The complainant had been suffering from shoulder and back aches. Upon the recommendation of a friend, she decided to go to a newly opened Traditional Chinese Medicine Centre (‘TCM Centre’) on 2 December 2017. The accused was her masseur. He massaged her neck, shoulders and back whilst fully clothed. After the massage, she bought a package consisting of one hour treatments for $588. On 16 December 2017, the complainant went for the second massage. After the second massage session, she made a police report of molest against the accused on the next day at 9.43pm.

2       The accused claimed that the allegation was false. He claimed trial to the following charge:

> are charged that you, on 16 December 2017, sometime between 2.10 p.m. and 3.10 p.m., at Zhong Kang TCM located at Block 161 Bukit Merah Central #01-3729, Singapore, did use criminal force to one XXX, _to wit_, by using your fingers of both hands to lightly squeeze the sides of both her breasts, using your hand to brush her right nipple twice, and using your fingers to pinch her right nipple once, intending to outrage her modesty, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Revised Edition).

3       I was satisfied that the charge was established beyond a reasonable doubt and the accused was accordingly found guilty and convicted. He was sentenced to ten months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane. He has appealed against the conviction and sentence.

## The Prosecution’s case

### Evidence of PW1- Complainant

4       The complainant was about 37 years of age in 2017. Her first visit to the TCM Centre was on 2 December 2017. She went there as her close friend, Ho Jia Min (‘Jia Min’) had signed her up for a promotional treatment for her shoulders and back. At about 2pm, she arrived there. She was attended to by two female staff at the counter. She was asked to sit on a stool and was told that the ‘shifu’ will evaluate her condition and recommend a treatment. She was informed that he had a lot of experience and regular clients.

5       The ‘shifu’ who attended to her was the accused. He pressed her shoulders whilst she was seated on the stool. Thereafter, she was told by the counter staff that a one hour treatment will be more beneficial for her neck, shoulder and back issues. The complainant accepted the suggestion to upgrade her treatment to one hour.

6       She was asked to proceed to a massage room. She lay face down on the massage bed. She was fully clothed. The accused placed a towel lengthwise to cover her back. He used an ointment to massage her neck and shoulders. He also massaged her upper back and spent a few minutes on her lower back. The massage on the back was done over the towel. Thereafter, she was asked to lie supine. Her body was also covered with the towel. The accused continued with the massage on her neck and shoulders. He also massaged her collar bone for a short while. During the last phase, she was asked to sit on a chair.

7       Asked if she had any conversation with the accused during the massage, she said the accused told her he has a daughter. He commented that her muscles were tight and asked if she used to workout. He also told her that she resembled his long-time client as she was plump and jovial like her.

8       After the massage, the counter staff persuaded her to purchase a massage package to treat her shoulders and back. She agreed. She paid $588 for the package. She fixed an appointment for 9 December 2017 and subsequently changed it to 16 December 2017 at 2 pm, the day of the incident.

9       The complainant was late for her appointment, and received a phone call from the TCM Centre asking her if she was coming. She was then on her way and was in the bus with Jia Min. At about 2.10pm, the complainant reached the TCM Centre. The accused was smoking outside. The complainant entered first. The accused was behind her. He told her to enter the massage room and asked her to remove her top. The complainant confirmed she had to take off her top. The accused answered in the affirmative. He then closed the sliding door to the room. She realised there was no towel in the room and did not remove her top. When the accused knocked on the door to check if she was ready, she replied that there was no towel. The accused opened the door and laid some bottles on a trolley. He saw that there was no towel and left to get it. After he passed her the towel, he waited outside. The complainant then removed her T-shirt, but kept her bra on. She lay facing down on the massage bed and covered her back with the towel lengthwise from her neck to her calf area.

10     Thereafter the complainant said she was ready. The accused entered the massage room. He first applied oil to her neck area and proceeded to massage her neck. After that, he applied oil on her back. He told her that he needed to pull the bra straps down and moved both bra straps down to the upper arms. The complainant rationalised that the accused did not want to get oil on her bra. The accused continued to apply oil and massage between the shoulder blades. When he moved below her shoulder blades, he said he needed to unbuckle the bra and proceeded to do so. The complainant again rationalised that the accused did so to avoid staining her bra with the oil. She agreed that she cooperated with the accused to remove the straps from her arms.

11     The accused continued to massage the complainant’s back and proceeded to the lower back. After which, he pulled down the complainant’s pants and panties, exposing half her buttocks, and spread oil and massaged her buttocks. The complainant was shocked but concluded that the accused was massaging her spinal cord. She stated that this was because the massage at the area relieved some tension. After massaging her buttocks, the accused pulled up her pants and panties. He then massaged her back again all the way to her shoulders and neck.

12     Next, the accused told the complainant to turn over. Based on the complainant’s estimate, there were about 10 to 20 minutes left of the massage at this stage. The complainant pulled the towel to ensure that her chest was covered as she turned to sit up. In the process of turning, she noticed that her bra was left on the bed. She quickly picked it up as she felt embarrassed. She positioned the towel to cover her up to her shoulders before she lay down.

13     As she lay facing up, the accused was standing near her head. He massaged her neck and shoulders with a pressing and kneading motion. The complainant found it to be very painful. She endured the pain and did not complain as she felt it was part and parcel of the treatment. It was her evidence that the accused made some conversation and remarked that plump girls like her tend to have better temperament unlike his wife. He also told her that she resembled his regular client who had a very good temper and was always smiling.

14     The accused next started to massage her collar bone. She found it to be very painful. She said her eyes were closed and she was wincing in pain. Suddenly, she felt a sharp pain on the side of her left breast. She exclaimed “ouch”. The accused immediately stopped the massage. He went to her left side and lifted the towel slightly to look at her left breast. He said “_no, uh, it’s not reddish_”, and put down the towel. The complainant felt confused and uncomfortable. She justified the accused’s action by thinking that he did it out of necessity as she had exclaimed in pain and he therefore wanted to check if she had been harmed.

15     Thereafter, the accused returned to where he was standing near her head and continued massaging her shoulders and collarbone. Shortly, she felt the accused’s hands moving below her collarbone. She felt the accused’s thumb was on her chest above her breasts and at the same time his fingers were around the side of both her breasts under the towel. She felt a light squeezing on the sides of her breasts for a second or so, which she referred to as ‘a caress kind of feeling’. The complainant was stumped and confused. She said that she was in pain from the massage and was unable to gather her thoughts.

16     Thereafter, the accused continued with the massage. She then felt the accused’s hand under the towel and his palm brushed against her right nipple. For the first occasion, she was prepared to dismiss it as accidental. However, it happened again after around two to three minutes. She was then certain that it could not have been accidental. She then felt a light pinching sensation on her right nipple for a few seconds. Her right nipple became erect. She felt very confused. She closed her eyes tightly because she did not know what else to do or say. She said her only thought then was to leave the TCM Centre. The accused remarked that her eyes were tightly shut. The accused continued with the massage for a short while longer. After that he said the massage has ended. He told the complainant that he will concentrate on her chest area at the next session. He then left the room.

17     After putting on her clothes, the complainant went to the counter. As she was confused, she did not know what to do. She just wanted to leave straight away. She did not tell the counter staff (Hu Xiu Mei) about the accused’s actions. She booked another appointment with her as it was the fastest way she could get out. She confirmed that she was asked to give her feedback and was given a sad, neutral or smiley face to choose from (see D1). She signed under the smiley face. She explained that she did not choose the sad or neutral face because she would then have been asked questions like how they can improve, et cetera. As such, she took the easy option of choosing the smiley face to leave as soon as possible.

18     She then went to buy lunch from a nearby coffeeshop before heading to Jia Min’s office which was close by. Jia Min asked her how the massage was. The complainant said she hesitated. She explained that she was still very confused and was trying to get a grip on what had happened. She told Jia Min that she felt uncomfortable. Jia Min enquired why it was uncomfortable. She replied that she did not know why the accused touched her breasts and pinched her nipple. She commented that it was weird. Jia Min was taken aback and said that it was not proper. Jia Min then started crying and apologising to her. The complainant thought that Jia Min felt guilty for recommending the place. She then decided to stop talking about the matter. Jia Min asked her if she wanted to report to the police but she told her not at that point. The complainant then had her lunch.

19     Afterwards, she helped Jia Min with her work. However, they both did not have the mood and left between 5 to 6pm. The complainant took about an hour to reach home at Tampines. At 7.26pm, she sent WhatsApp messages (screenshots admitted as exhibit P5) to another close friend, Koh Hui Ling, Florence (‘Florence’). The complainant said that she wanted affirmation from Florence that she indeed had been molested. She informed her that the accused “_massage my breast and pinch my nipple_”. She elaborated that the accused “_was like caressing my breasts_”. She also told her that she did not confront the accused during the incident as she was ‘blur’ and did not know how to react. She stated she was “_considering want to go to the police or not_” and asked Florence for her views. Florence said that she will accompany her to confront the accused on the same day. However, the complainant declined as the TCM Centre was quite far from her residence.

20     On the next day (17 December 2017), she called the TCM Centre and spoke to Hu Xiu Mei (‘Xiu Mei’). She asked her for the name of the accused. She also enquired if it was a practice to ask customers to remove their clothes. Xiu Mei confirmed that it was. She then told her that the accused had molested her by touching her chest. She also asked for a refund. Xiu Mei informed her that she would need some time to investigate her allegation and would call her back.

21     Subsequently, she received a phone call from a lady at the TCM Centre who said that it could be a misunderstanding and asked her not to blow up the matter as they were trying to make a living. She also asked her to come down to discuss and negotiate. The complainant rejected the request to negotiate. She was told that they will call her. The complainant said that she did not want to see the accused and step into the TCM Centre again and decided to forgo the refund. She did not pick up further calls from the TCM Centre.

22     In the evening, the complainant had dinner with Jia Min. At 9.43 pm on the same day, she lodged a police report.

23     Under cross-examination, the complainant stated that she had only one full body massage more than 10 years ago in Thailand. She said that the other massages she had been to were foot massages. She confirmed she was aware of oil massages but said she was unaware that her treatment at the TCM Centre will involve oil.

24     Asked if she was aware that there were other therapists apart from the accused who could have attended to her, she replied that she was only told the accused is very skilled and he will help her. She confirmed she did not ask for a female therapist. She said that she wanted the best person for the treatment and the assurance that she was being treated by the best person was sufficient to overcome the awkwardness of a male therapist touching her.

25     It was put to the complainant that the only contact which the accused had with her breasts was to massage the side of her breasts at her request, to which the complainant disagreed.

#### Evidence of PW2 – Koh Hui Ling, Florence (‘Florence’)

26     Florence came to know the complainant in 2007 or 2008 when they were colleagues. She described her as a best friend.

27     On 16 December 2017 between 7.26pm and 7.52pm, she exchanged WhatsApp messages (see P5) with the complainant relating to the TCM massage which the complainant had earlier on the same day. The complainant informed her that ‘_I think I got molested lor_’. The complainant told her that the masseur massaged her breasts and pinched her nipples. She also said the masseur was ‘like caressing’ her breasts and pulled her pants to expose her buttocks. The complainant remarked, ‘_Got like that one meh_” Florence replied that a masseur cannot pinch the nipples and she was thus molested. She also told her that a masseur cannot ask a female customer to strip.

28     She asked the complainant if she confronted the masseur. The complainant informed her that she did not because she ‘_was blur and didn’t know how to react’_. The complainant told her that she was considering whether to go to the police and asked for her opinion. Florence advised her to do it on the same day. She also told the complainant that she could go with her to confront the masseur at the TCM Centre. The complainant replied that she was at home and the TCM Centre was far. The complainant said that she will call the TCM Centre tomorrow to terminate her package and ask for a refund.

29     On 17 December 2017 at about 12.27pm, Florence messaged the complainant to ask how she was doing. The complainant replied that she called the TCM Centre to complain. However, she was asked why she did not make a complaint after the session and was told that they could reassign a female therapist. She rejected the suggestion and said she did not want to step into the TCM Centre. Florence told the complainant to make a report and ask for a refund.

30     At 5.28pm on the same day, Florence messaged the complainant again to find out what the TCM Centre said. Florence said she sent the message without checking what the complainant had already told her. The complainant told her that she fell asleep and another woman requested her to go to the TCM Centre to discuss but she rejected the request.

31     Under cross-examination, she said the complainant was aware that she went for massages regularly. She had been with the complainant twice to a TCM Centre at Beach Road. She said the complainant only had a leg massage whilst she had a body massage.

32     She was asked if she agreed that the complainant was checking with her what allegedly occurred as she stated ‘_I think I got molested lor_’ and elaborated ‘_He go and massage my breast and pinch my nipples leh. Got like that one meh._’ Florence replied that she felt that the complainant was confused over what to do next. She went on to elaborate as follows[^1]:

> A    They have to gather their thoughts after being molest, okay, as a woman, we have to gather our thoughts and the first thing that I believe a woman has been molested, they would want to---especially when they are naked, okay, they will want to just get out of that place and gather the thoughts and, you know, um, think about it again.

> Q    Are you saying that such reactions are normal and common for every woman?

> A    Not for every woman. Some women they are really very strong-willed that they want to confront immediately, but some women they will turn to be more composed and more calm and they will want to gather everything first because this is a very serious crime.

#### Evidence of PW3 – Ho Jia Min (‘Jia Min’)

33     Jia Min is a good friend of the complainant. The TCM Centre is located across the road from her office block. She was informed of a promotion that the TCM Centre was having by an ex-colleague. Jia Min went to the TCM Centre and bought two vouchers for $8 each – one for her mother and one for the complainant. She made an appointment on behalf of the complainant for 2 December 2017 with the TCM Centre.

34     On 16 December 2017, Jia Min asked the complainant to help her with some work. They both went to the TCM Centre together at around 2pm but Jia Min left for her office whilst the complainant had her massage.

35     Sometime after 3pm, the complainant went to Jia Min’s office. Jia Min asked her how the massage was. She said the complainant’s expression changed immediately. Jia Min found it hard to describe the complainant’s expression and said it was ‘definitely a not happy look’. Her recollection was that the complainant said something to the effect that the session was strange or weird. She asked her what had happened. The complainant then told her that she was touched on her breasts. Jia Min asked her if she was sure and the complainant told her that her nipple(s) was also touched. Jia Min was upset and broke down. Jia Min said that she cries easily. The complainant then stopped the conversation and consoled her.

36     On the following day, whilst Jia Min was having lunch at a coffeeshop near her office, the complainant sent her a message that she had called the TCM Centre. Jia Min asked her why she called. The complainant told her that she wanted to complain to the TCM Centre so that they will be aware of what happened. Instead, she was asked if there could be a mistake. Jia Min was quite angry upon hearing that. After Jia Min finished her lunch, she decided to take a picture of the accused. She walked to the TCM Centre. She saw the accused sitting outside and smoking and took a photograph of him. She sent the photograph to the complainant. Jia Min then went to her office.

37     In the evening, Jia Min had dinner with the complainant. The complainant informed her that she will be lodging a police report.

38     Under cross-examination, she stated that the complainant felt ‘a bit of anger and upset’ over how such a thing could have happened.

#### Evidence of PW4 – Hu Xiu Mei

39     Xiu Mei is a TCM assistant at the Centre. She also assists with the reception duties when Zheng Xiulian (‘Xiulian’) is busy. She stated the accused’s job scope was to assist customers who had neck and shoulder issues by doing the Chinese massage, Tui Na, to relax the muscles.

40     She recalled that the complainant had used a promotional voucher bought by her friend at the first session. After the 20-minute session, she bought a treatment course. She said the sale of the treatment course was handled by Xiulian.

41     On 16 December 2017, Xiu Mei was at the reception counter when the complainant finished her massage session. She asked the complainant how was the massage. The complainant replied “Very good. Not bad.” She asked the complainant if she wanted to book the next appointment. The complainant requested for the next session to be at the same timing.

42     On 17 December 2017 at about 11.30am, she received a call from the complainant. The complainant alleged that the accused had touched her chest and said she wanted to make a police report of molest against him. Xiu Mei enquired if there could have been a misunderstanding, and asked why she did not inform her after the session. The complainant replied that she did not want to mention it then as the accused was ‘behind’. Xiu Mei requested for time to find out about the incident and told the complainant that she will call her back at 3pm.

43     She then spoke to the accused about the allegation. She said he appeared shocked and denied the allegation. She told him to write down what took place during the treatment process. The accused wrote down his account (D2). Subsequently, she tried to call the complainant. However, she did not answer.

44     Asked if the complainant had requested for a refund, she said that she did not. On the same day, in the evening, Xiu Mei made a record of her conversation with the complainant (see exhibit P6).

45     Under cross-examination, she stated that the therapist will usually ask the customer if he or she wants to use oil for the massage or just acupressure. She stated that if oil is used, the customer would remove his or clothing and cover the body with a towel.

46     As regards the assignment of a therapist to a customer, she stated that it was done by Xiulian or herself. The assignment was dependant on customer requirements, for example, preference for the amount of strength to be used for the massage and the gender of the therapist and the availability of a therapist.

47     She confirmed that the complainant was asked to sign after the treatment to indicate the treatment has been done and to rate the service. She stated that the complainant selected the smiley face rating. She said the complainant did not appear sad or unhappy.

#### Evidence of PW5 – Zeng Xiulian (‘Xiulian’)

48     Xiulian is a manager at the TCM Centre. She stated the accused’s job scope was to provide treatment by using the Tui Na technique for complaints of headache, neck, shoulder, wrist pain and leg sprains. She stated the customer will be fully dressed and the area to be treated will only be exposed if oil was used.

49     As regards the complainant, she stated that she first came for shoulder and neck treatment on 2 December 2017. Xiulian asked her if she wanted a male or female therapist. The complainant did not have a preference. As it was the turn of the accused, she assigned him to the complainant.

50     After the session, the complainant felt that the treatment was very good. Xiulian suggested to her to buy a package for shoulder and neck treatment. The complainant agreed and bought the package which cost $588. She requested to book the next appointment with the accused.

51     Under cross-examination, Xiulian confirmed that the accused had treated male and female customers. Asked about the feedback that he received, she said his techniques were said to be good and he had solved the customers’ problems.

52     On 17 December 2017, she was informed by Xiu Mei that the complainant had telephoned to complain that the accused had molested her. Xiulian informed the accused about the complaint and remarked that if it had really happened, it will not be tolerated. The accused denied the accusation.

53     Subsequently on the same day, the complainant called again. This time she (Xiulian) answered the call. However, the complainant refused to talk to her and wanted to speak only to Xiu Mei.

### Evidence of PW6 – Senior Station Inspector Chin Sau Hui (‘SSI Chin’)

54     SSI Chin took over the investigations on 26th December 2017. She confirmed that the accused was arrested when he went to a Neighbourhood Police Post in February 2018. She stated that the initial investigation officer went to the accused’s residence but the accused was not in. A police gazette was then issued for his arrest.

## Prima facie case

55     There was rightly no submission of ‘no case’ at the close of the prosecution’s case. I was satisfied that there is some evidence which is not inherently incredible and which satisfied the elements of the charge. The two courses were explained to the accused. He elected to give evidence. He called one witness in his defence.

## Defence case

### Evidence of Accused

56     The accused started working at the TCM Centre as a masseur on 5 November 2017. He was assigned male and female customers by Xiulian or Xiu Mei. He stated the customer would be fully clothed unless the customer wanted an oil massage.

57     As regards the complainant, he said her first visit on 2 December 2017 was during the promotion period. He was assigned to attend to her by Xiu Mei. The complainant told him that she had issues with her neck. She requested for a 20 minute session. She found the treatment to be good and extended it to an hour. He then brought her to a room where he massaged her neck, shoulders, back and legs whilst she lay prone. He also massaged the front of her neck to her collar bone whilst she was supine. The complainant was fully clothed during the massage. After the massage, she told him that he did a good job. She also bought a package.

58     On 16 December 2017, the complainant came for her second session. She told him that she was feeling much better. However, she felt pain on the day after the massage. She asked him if he could use oil. He agreed because more strength is used without oil and the customer may feel plain on the following day.

59     He showed her to the room and waited outside. He disagreed he used the room marked as ‘incident room’ in the sketch plan. According to him, he used the middle room. After about two to three minutes, he knocked on the door and asked if he could enter. She told him that he could do so. When he entered, the complainant was lying face down with a towel covering her body. She had removed her top but was wearing her pants. He disagreed that there was no towel in the room. He said the towels were always replenished after use.

60     He started the massage by using a technique to ‘open’ the back for two to three minutes. Thereafter he removed the towel. He slotted a small towel in the waist of the complainant’s pants to prevent the oil from staining it. He then poured the massage oil onto his hand and massaged once on the back. He realised that the complainant was still wearing her bra. He asked if she wanted to remove it to avoid staining it. The complainant removed it on her own. He then continued to massage her back. After about 30 minutes, the complainant said she was experiencing stuffiness in her chest. He asked if it was serious. She said it was okay. He continued with the massage.

61     After about 50 minutes, he asked the complainant to turn over. The complainant did so and covered her body with the towel. He massaged the muscle below the earlobe to the collarbone as the complainant had difficulty in turning her neck. After about one to two minutes, the complainant exclaimed ‘Ouch’ and said it was very painful. She also told him that she was having some pain in her chest. He said that she pointed to the centre of her left breast. He asked her if she was alright. She told him it was ‘just a little pain’ and she was okay. She then asked him to massage her breasts. He told her that he was not allowed to do so. She told him that she will not complain. He was in a dilemma and his heart was beating very fast. He said the complainant’s face was red and he was afraid that there might be something wrong with her. He was also afraid that he might offend her if he did not do as requested resulting in a complaint against him.

62     As a result, he massaged with his thumb from her collarbone down to the side of her left breast. He was unable to recall how many times he massaged the side of her left breast as he was feeling giddy then. He wanted to end the massage after massaging a few times but the complainant told him that she was feeling sore on the side of her right breast as well. He then massaged downwards from the collarbone to the side of her right breast.

63     He claimed that Xiulian entered the room towards the end of the massage to take a device. He stated the complainant was then supine but he was unable to remember which part of the body he was massaging at that point.

64     When he ended the massage, he told the complainant that he would arrange for a female colleague to attend to her in future. He also told her that her chest pain or stuffiness was related to her high blood pressure. He then left the room and poured a cup of water for her. He passed the cup of water to the complainant after she came out. Thereafter, he went to the back to smoke.

65     On the next day, at about 11am, he told his colleague, Fang Yu Lan (‘Fang’), that a customer had asked him to massage her breasts. He told Fang that he was unwilling to do so and asked her to attend to the customer on her subsequent visits. Fang agreed to do so. At this point, Xiu Mei called him over.

66     Xiu Mei told him to go outside of the shop. She told him that there was a complaint of molest against him by the complainant. She told him it was better to resolve it as the police will otherwise be called. He told her to call the police instead. However, she told him that it would be best if he could settle with the complainant privately. He said he was unable to settle as he did not do it. He again told Xiu Mei to call the police. She told him to take it slowly and she would communicate with the complainant. Thereafter, Xiu Mei asked him to write his account of what happened during the massage.

67     He wrote his account in Chinese (see D2 and D2T). He claimed his account reflected only partially what had happened. He claimed he left out that the complainant had asked him to massage her breasts and he massaged the sides of her breasts as it was against the company’s rules and he did not want it to be misinterpreted. He said he wanted to clarify with the police. After he had written his account, he was asked to go back and wait for a call.

68     On the next day, Xiu Mei told him that she had passed his phone number and residential address to the police. However, the police did not contact him.

69     About two months later, he applied for a job. He was told by the prospective employer that someone had lodged a complaint against him. He then went to Kim Seng NPC to enquire. He was then placed under arrest and detained.

70     On the following day (8 February 2018), SSI Chin came to record a statement from him. He said SSI Chin had used a certain tone and he decided not to state in his statement that the complainant asked him to massage her breasts.

#### Evidence of DW2 – Fang Yu Lan (‘Fang’)

71     Fang worked as a masseuse at the TCM Centre between late October 2017 and 30th April 2018. Based on the roster (D3), she was on leave on 16 December 2017. She went to work on the following day. She testified that she would usually arrive before 10am and bask in the sun. She was unable to remember if she arrived before the accused on 17 December 2017.

72     Upon arrival at the TCM Centre, it was her practice to proceed to the rear of the premises. She would usually chat with her colleagues about what happened the day before. She claimed that she chatted with the accused on 17 December 2017. He told her that he met a weird customer and he could introduce the customer to her. He did not tell her what was weird about the customer. Subsequently, she added that the accused told her that it was inconvenient for him and he would introduce the customer to her another day. However, he did not tell her what he meant by inconvenient.

73     Fang was allowed to refresh her memory with her prior statement that she made on 12 February 2019 at the law firm of the defence. She confirmed that the contents of the statement (see D4) were correct. In that statement, she stated the accused told her that a female customer had asked him to massage the ‘front area’ and it was therefore inconvenient for him. Asked what her reaction was upon hearing that, she said that she merely listened.

74     Under cross-examination, she said the accused told her that it was not suitable for him to do it and that it will be more convenient for a lady to do it. She stated that she did not know why the accused said that.

## Findings

75     There were two contested version of events. The accused asserted that the complainant’s allegation of molest is false. It was claimed that she asked for a breast massage and the accused had only massaged the sides of her breasts over the towel. The complainant strongly disagreed that she asked for a breast massage. The prosecution asserted that the complainant had no reason to make a false allegation as she did not know the accused save for the interactions during the two massage sessions. She had no grudge against him and neither did she stand to gain by incriminating him.

76     At the heart of the case is the assessment of the credibility of the complainant and the accused. The case hinged on the complainant’s word against that of the accused’s. This is typical for the vast majority of outrage of modesty offences committed in such circumstances. As the complainant’s account of the incident was uncorroborated, the standard to be used is therefore the “unusually convincing” standard. This has been explained in _GCK v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 2</span> to “describe a situation where the witness’s testimony is “so convincing that the Prosecution’s case \[is\] proven beyond reasonable doubt, solely on the basis of the evidence”: see _Mohammed Liton_ at \[38\]. In _Haliffie bin Mamat v Public Prosecutor and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 636</span> at \[28\], this court considered that “a complainant’s testimony would be unusually convincing if the testimony, ‘when weighed against the overall backdrop of the available facts and circumstances, contains that ring of truth which leaves the court satisfied that no reasonable doubt exists in favour of the accused’” (citing _Mohammed Liton_ at \[39\]). The relevant considerations in this regard include the witness’s demeanour, and the internal and external consistencies of the witness’s evidence.”

77     The following arguments were made by the defence in support of its submission that the complainant’s evidence should not be believed.

### (i)   The complainant was not truthful about how the accused came to be assigned to be her masseur

78     It was submitted that the complainant lied when she asserted that she was not informed that a female masseuse could perform the treatment. The defence relied on the following excerpts of Xiu Mei and Xiulian’s evidence:

> _Hu Xiu Mei[^2]:_

> Q    Will you for example, let the customer know---okay, so for example, alright, if you believe for some reason that at that time, that the accused was suitable for treating that condition, will you recommend the accused, without letting the customer know that there are other female masseurs around?

> A    So we have a male and female, so we will ask if you mind having a male doing it for you. So we will let the customer know and also seek the customer’s opinion. So if the customer doesn’t mind and just so happens that it was Wang Lin’s turn, then we will let Wang Lin do it, but for example if the customer minds, then we will skip Wang Lin and ask the next person to do it.

> _Zeng Xiulian[^3]:_

> Q    Meaning, according to the Complainant’s testimony, she said that she wasn’t aware that there were the option of having female masseurs to massage---to do the treatment for her. Would it be possible?

> A    She---she cannot say that---she cannot---she cannot say that she’s not aware. When she came---when she---when she arrived, I had already asked her. Before she received any treatment, I asked her to choose the gender of the therapist.

> Q    And you remember that very clearly?

> A    Correct, because she’s a female customer and---and it was a male therapist’s turn when this customer arrived so we would have to ask her, “Do you mind?”

79     At the outset, it must be stated that the complainant did not allege that she asked for a female masseuse but was instead assigned the accused. Her evidence was as follows[^4]:

> Q    Did you ask whether there were other masseurs around?

> A    No. I did not.

> Q    You didn’t. Okay. So you were told that a male masseur, right, was going to do a massage for you in a room and you didn’t ask if there could be anoth---someone else do it, for example, a female---

> A    Mmm hmm.

> Q    masseur, correct?

> A    Yes, that’s correct.

> Q    Thank you. Would it be fair to say then that at that point in time at least, you were comfortable for a male masseur to massage you?

> A    I would not say comfortable but I felt that if I’m going for a treatment and they recommend him as the best person available to give that treatment I would accept it regardless of his gender. Because the trust that they can give me the treatment I need, uh, overrides that awkwardness of having a male touching my body.

80     The complainant had no complaint that a male masseur was assigned to her. She had no complaint about the first massage session. In fact, she bought a package at a cost of $588 and booked a second session with the accused. Accordingly, the alleged discrepancy of whether the complainant was offered a choice of a male or female therapist is a non-material issue.

81     But for completeness, I do not accept that the complainant had deliberately lied. Although Xiulian claimed that she gave the complainant a choice of a male or female therapist and that the complainant had no preference, Xiu Mei did not testify that the complainant was given a choice. Xiu Mei simply stated that if it was the turn of a male therapist, the customer would be asked if she minded a male therapist. Significantly, it was their evidence that the only available therapist then was the accused. The availability of only a male masseur was clearly relevant as evident from the following evidence of Xiu Mei[^5]:

>   
| 

Q

 | 

So after listening to the customer’s requirements, someone will recommend a masseur to the customer?

 |
| 

A

 | 

So yes, so we will make the arrangement. Depends on our work arrangement. For example, the 1st person is already working and we will arrange for the 2nd person and the 2nd person is working, we will arrange for the 3rd person.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

When you say “We”, do you mean yourself and Ms. Zeng Xiulian?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes, usually.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

So it also depends on who’s available?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Yes.

 |

  
  

82     I set out below the complainant’s evidence on what transpired at the first meeting on 2 December 2017 when the accused was assigned to be her masseur. She said[^6]:

> …\[U\]pon seeing me, they asked for my number and name to confirm my appointment and asked me what treatment I was there for. Okay. And after that, um, they took out a wooden chair just beside the counter and asked me to sit there and said he will---they will ask the, uh, master, yah, master, I think, Shifu.

> …

> Q    Okay, so just rewind a bit. Whose idea was it to have a male person massage you on that day?

> A    Okay. When I approached the 2 ladies, uh, they immediately recommended the---the accused. Uh, because they said that he has a lot of experience. And I was under the impression that he was the only one who can provide me the kind of treatment I need.

> Q    Why were you under the impression that he was the only one who could provide the treatment that you needed?

> A    Because they told me he is very experienced, uh, he has man---a lot of client---a lot regular clients. So he will be able to tell me, uh, after examining me, uh, wheth---what kind of treatment I need. So, they did not recommend me someone else, but just him.

> Q    And when you say “they”, who are you referring to?

> A    Uh, the 2 ladies at the counter that day.

> …

> A    they told me why not I upgrade my package instead of just 20 minutes, go for 1-hour one and the Shifu, uh, will help me to correct my back issues---my back and my neck, my shoulders issue. Yah. But they did not---

> Q    Yes.

> A    specifically tell me, uh, told me, um, what they going to use, how they going to press, not that specific. But they did tell me that what they are recommending would be more beneficial for me.

> …

> Q    Okay. At that time, Zhong Kang had other masseurs around. Are you aware of that?

> A    I was not aware of it. Because the 2 ladies who attended to me were at the counter. I do not know they are qualified masseurs. I was not told that they can perform it as well. So they told me ---they recommended him straightaway---the accused straightaway. So they did not tell me that, you know, they can do it also. They just tell me, uh, this Shifu is very skilled, he’ll be helping you with it.

83     It is significant that Xiu Mei testified that the accused’s job scope was “to help customers when they have some neck and shoulder injuries”. I accepted the complainant’s evidence that Xiu Mei and Xiulian referred to the accused as ‘shifu’ and they recommended him to assist her with her problem areas. The complainant accepted their recommendation and accordingly the question of the complainant having been presented with a choice of a male or female therapist did not arise.

### (ii)   The complainant lied about the events leading to her receiving a bare-bodied oil massage

84     It was submitted that the complainant lied that she did not request for an oil massage; that the accused requested her to remove her top; and that there was no towel in the massage room. It was submitted that the accused would not have ‘behaved so inappropriately and discourteously to a female customer in front of his superior; and if he did so, it would definitely not have escaped the notice of \[Xiu Mei\]’.

85     It was not the complainant’s evidence that there was something sinister because there was no towel in the room. She simply narrated the fact that there was no towel and she was given one when she requested for it. On the other hand, the defence attempted to discredit her evidence by submitting that it was highly unlikely that there was no towel in the room. It was added that Xiu Mei only saw the accused standing outside the door and did not see him passing the towel.

86     Whilst Xiu Mei’s evidence was that a therapist is expected to prepare the room after a treatment, which includes replacing the towel, she conceded that it is possible for a room not to have a towel although she was unaware of it happening. She said[^7]:

> …but sometimes we get busy, so for example, if you forget to clear something or sometimes you forget to put it there, there is no absolute situation.

87     As for the defence claim that Xiu Mei did not see the accused passing the towel although she had seen him waiting outside the room, it was never her evidence that she had observed the accused throughout whilst he was standing outside the room. She was performing her duties at the counter, and it would be highly odd if she had observed him throughout. As such, the fact that she did not see the accused passing a towel is neither here nor there.

88     The complainant gave a detailed account as follows[^8]:

> So, after he knocked on the door, um, he called from out--- outside to ask if I was ready. So, I told him, “No, uh, I don’t have a towel”. That was when he opened the door, uh, he took some bottles and laid it on the trolley which was in front of me. Then he took a towel, passed it to me, closed the sliding door and he waited outside.

> Q    Are you able to recall where he took the towel from?

> A    I don’t get to see it.

> Q    Okay.

> A    Because he got it from outside then he pass---passed it to me when I was inside.

In my judgment, the complainant did not conjure up the above account and was able to relate the details spontaneously because they had happened as testified to by her.

89     As for the claim that the accused would not have acted inappropriately by asking the complainant to take off her top in front of Xiu Mei, the complainant did not testify that the accused said that to her in the presence of Xiu Mei. On her evidence, the accused was at the door of the massage room when he said it. Her specific evidence was as follows[^9]:

> …he told me to go into the room and he asked me to take off my top. So, that was when I asked him, “Take of my top?”, then he say, “Yes, take off top”, and he closed the sliding door and he went off.

90     As regards the use of oil, the accused’s evidence was that the complainant had asked him if he could use oil. His evidence that the complainant brought up the use of oil is inconsistent with what was put to the complainant. Under cross-examination, it was put that the accused asked her if she wanted an oil massage[^10]:

> Q    Yes. So I’m---I’m putting it to you, right, that you were in fact asked whether or not you wanted an oil massage.

> A    No. I wasn’t asked.

> Q    Or---okay, thank you for answering the question. Or you had indicated that you wanted an oil massage.

> A    No. I wasn’t given that option.

91     The complainant explained that during the first massage she was fully clothed and the accused had used an ointment on her neck. The complainant did not hide the fact that she knew of the option of using oil. In response to why she did not question the accused on why she had to take off her top, she gave the following frank answers[^11]:

> Q    Yet, your testimony is that you didn’t request or ask why you had to take off your clothes, correct?

> A    I did ask him when he asked me to go in, take off my clothes, I asked “Huh? Need to take off my clothes?” He said, “Yes”.

> Q    And did you question why you had---didn’t have to do it the previous time?

> A    I did not question that but I just assumed it would be something to do with the upcoming treatment.

It was not in dispute that the complainant only removed her bra whilst she was lying prone on the massage bed. It was the accused’s evidence that customers who asked for an oil massage would from his experience remove their bra on their own. The fact that the complainant did not do so is therefore consistent with her evidence that she did not ask for an oil massage.

92     The complainant did not think anything was amiss at the stage when her bra was removed because she had rationalised it was to prevent it from being stained. After the incident, she sought confirmation from her close friend, Florence, if the removal of clothes is required. This further lends support to the complainant’s evidence that she did not remove her bra because she was only told to remove her top. Accordingly, I rejected the defence’s contention that the complainant had received an oil massage because she had requested for it.

### (iii)   The complainant lied about her telephone conversations with the TCM Centre after the incident

93     It was alleged that the complainant’s evidence that a different lady from the TCM Centre had called her back and tried to persuade her to come down to the clinic to negotiate was untrue and that she had instead called back because she was anxious for a resolution. In this regard, reliance was placed on Xiu Mei’s evidence that no one else from the clinic had called back the complainant. The defence also relied on the following evidence from Xiulian[^12]:

> Q    So, you mean that right after Hu Xiu Mei put down the phone, the---the next call was the Complainant?

> A    No. After Hu Xiu Mei received the complaint call, and she related incident to me, then I checked with Wang Lin. Wang Lin said that there was no such incident, so we had to do an investigation. Af---after that, we received another call from her, the Complainant, and I was the one who picked up the call. She refused to answer me, she wanted Hu Xiu Mei to and---to talk to her.

> …

> Q    Okay. Did you try to persuade her to come down to the shop to discuss directly with you?

> A    When I was on the phone with her, it was very short. She simply refused to talk to me. I had no chance to do that.

94     It is not in dispute that there were only two calls. Xiu Mei informed the complainant that she will call her back at 3pm. The issue was simply who made the second call. Based on the WhatsApp messages of the complainant to Florence at 5.31pm, the complainant informed Florence that she fell asleep. She stated, “_now called back the person busy another woman asked me to go their shop to talk_.” This message does suggest that the complainant made a second call to the shop. However, it is not clear if she was returning a missed call which she received when she fell asleep and thus used the words ‘called back’, or she had used the words because she made a second call. In any case, what is significant is what transpired between her and Xiulian. The spontaneous and detailed account of the complainant’s evidence is set out below[^13]:

> A    They told me they’ll be investigating. They’ll need some time to investigate and that they’ll call me back (clears throat), excuse me. They’ll call me back after that to let me know.

> Q    Yes.

> A    So the second call I got was for them---was to hear them asking me to go down so that they can---we can discuss, we can negotiate which was not---which was not what I expected.

> Q    I’m sorry, what---what do you expect?

> A    The outcome of what they investigated because that was, uh, that was what they told me. Give them some time so that they can go and investigate what happened. They will call me back but when they called me back, they wanted me to go down, uh, to negotiate, uh, to negotiate and discuss because don’t spoilt their livelihood. So I was under the assumption that they were trying to---they were trying for me not to escalate the matter in that sense. So, uh, I didn’t want to negotiate under these terms.

> Q    Again---again, this was not---this as what you mentioned regarding them wanting you not to escalate the matter and all that, it wasn’t actually told to you over the phone, right? They didn’t tell you not to---they didn’t tell you to---did they tell you to not to go to the police, for example?

> A    They did told me not to---they did tell me not to, uh, blow up the matter if, uh, translated, lah, because we spoke in Mandarin. They did say, uh, there is no need to blow up the matter. Why not you come down and discuss and we see what we---we can negotiate---

> Q    Okay, thank you.

> A    Yah. Since they were all just trying to make a living. That was what they said.

> Q    Now you mentioned that you made 2 calls with them---you had 2 conversations with them over the phone.

> A    To the best of my memory, yes.

> Q    The first was on the 17th around noon. Is it correct to say that?

> A    Around noon, yah.

> Q    And then a few hours later, you got the second call asking you to come down to negotiate.

> A    I can’t remember how much time in between but certain time in between passed, yes.

95     The complainant’s evidence that she was asked to go to the shop to discuss is consistent with her WhatsApp messages to Florence. In her messages she stated: “… _another woman asked me to go to their shop to talk. I told her why need to go? She said need to discuss. I told her I don’t see a need to.”_ In contrast, Xiulian claimed that her recollection was ‘quite fuzzy’ about the phone call. The only evidence that she gave was that the complainant had refused to talk to her. She gave no evidence on why she could not pass the phone to Xiu Mei since the complainant did not wish to speak to her. Further, if the complainant was anxious to have a resolution as alleged, there was simply no reason for her to refuse to speak to Xiulian.

96     In my judgment, it was not in the interest of Xiulian to reveal that she had asked the complainant not to blow up the matter and to negotiate instead. I found that she therefore hid behind her alleged ‘fuzzy’ recollection. I found the evidence of the complainant that she was told not to blow up the matter, that they were trying to making a living, and to come down to discuss to have a ring of truth.

97     Further, the evidence of the complainant was that she thereafter refused to answer any calls. Her explanation for not doing so was as follows[^14]:

> Q    But when you didn’t agree, they said that they will call you back again?

> A    When I did not ag---when I told them that I don’t see a need to go down, they say they will call me back but after that I did not answer anymore.

> …

> Q    Would it be fair to say that they just needed to find out more, probably hear from you themselves in order to be certain of your complaint?

> A    Uh, maybe they---they are seeing it that way, but the way I see it is, if I were to go to the police, they will come to know about it anyway. So I do not have to address it directly with them at that point.

> …

> Q    So going down to clarify with them would have assisted, at least, in the endeavour.

> A    Um---

> Q    Do you agree with me?

> A    Okay. Maybe it could have, uh, become a refund or what. I do not know at this point. But right there and then, I decided not to because I simply do not want to step into that place anymore. I do not want to see the accused. I do not want to see anyone from that shop anymore which was why I decided, you know, I will just forego the money. Forget it. I don’t want anything out of it anymore.

98     Xiu Mei confirmed that the complainant did not answer her calls. It therefore lends credence to the evidence of the complainant that she told Xiulian that she did not want to go down to discuss. Accordingly, I found no merit in the submission that the complainant lied about her telephone conversations.

### (iv)   The complainant had lied in her phone conversation with Xiu Mei

99     In her telephone conversation with the complainant, Xiu Mei asked the complainant why she failed to make a complaint the previous day after her massage session. She recorded the complainant’s answer as:

> He was following behind; I did not feel comfortable mentioning it then.

It was submitted that this excuse was false because the accused did not follow the complainant and the complainant herself had confirmed this fact.

100    The complainant’s evidence was that the accused was at the back of the shop. She gave the following answers[^15]:

> Q    But you decided not to do it, correct?

> A    Yes, because the accused was at the back. I don’t know whose side this lady will be taking. I just want to go out. I just want to leave that place. I did consider for that split moment whether to say it but after that, he was at the back, if I say it, he might hear it. No, I better leave. I just want to leave.

> Q    When you say, “he was at the back”, do you mean he was at your back?

> A    He was at the back of the shop. I---at the back, I don’t know where, but he was definitely at the back. I saw him walking in.

101    The court interpreter’s translation of what was recorded in Mandarin was ‘He was going behind.’ Taking the interpretation of ‘He was going behind’, it can equally mean that the accused was proceeding to the back of the shop instead of following behind the complainant. This is consistent with the complainant’s evidence.

102    What is significant is that Xiu Mei confirmed that the complainant only used the word ‘behind’. She was asked[^16]:

> When you say---when she told you “behind”, did she say---did she say “behind her” or did she just say “behind”?

She answered:

> She just said “behind”.

103    The complainant therefore did not say that the accused was ‘following’ her. The word ‘back’ or ‘behind’ by itself can convey that the accused was at the rear of the shop. Xiu Mei conceded that there may have been some misunderstanding as seen from the following answer[^17]:

> Q    And that was the reason why she didn’t make a complaint straightaway because she said that the accused was behind her.

> A    So maybe sometime there is some misunderstanding, because after the session ended and the customer leaves the room, the masseuse or the masseur will certainly have to go back to the room to do some clearing up and so they would definitely be behind the customer.

104    It did not make sense for the complainant to tell a deliberate untruth to Xiu Mei because she (Xiu Mei) would clearly have known if the accused was around when the complainant spoke to her and could have easily rebutted her. The fact that she (Xiu Mei) did not do so clearly suggests that she did not understand the complainant to have meant that the accused was ‘following behind’. Xiu Mei had fairly conceded that she could not rule out a misunderstanding. Accordingly, I found that there is no basis to conclude that the complainant had lied.

### (v)   The complainant’s lack of reaction and delay in reporting

105    It was submitted that it was highly unbelievable that the complainant did not try to protest or object and had no adverse reaction whatsoever when the accused lifted the towel to look at her breast, put his fingers around the sides of her breasts to lightly squeeze them, brushed over the nipple of her right breast twice with his hand and pinched her nipple. It was submitted that the complainant did not tell Xiu Mei about it immediately after it ended but made a further appointment and ‘even reflected the highest level of satisfaction possible for the session’.

106    The complainant testified in detail how she felt during and after the massage session. I set out below some of her answers under cross-examination[^18]:

>   
| 

A

 | 

Because I was---

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

A

 | 

still very confused. It definitely felt wrong but I was wondering, you know, how it got to that point. I was still trying to get a grip of what happened in that sense.

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

 | 

I was on the---you know, on the doubting whether is it---was I really been molested or something else. Then, it was a very mixed feeling kind of thing. I don’t know how to explain that.

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Okay, so at that point in time, you weren’t 100% sure of---

 |
| 

A

 | 

I knew---

 |
| 

Q

 | 

you were---

 |
| 

A

 | 

it---

 |
| 

Q

 | 

molested.

 |
| 

A

 | 

happened. But I don’t know what to make of it.

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, it would be clear to you, right, if the accused had done that, wouldn’t that be a clear outrage of modesty?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I mean I haven’t been in this situation, enough to know what I should do next. So, um, I believe I’m given the right to feel confused at that time. So, I’m not too sure what you are trying to ask. Um---

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And then you say that, you know, he caressed your breasts for a few seconds. So, my question to you is, wouldn’t it be clear, right, that that is an outrage of modesty or---or molest if you---if you call it that way?

 |
| 

A

 | 

But I was not in the right mind at that moment to determine whether I was right.

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

 | 

Okay. Because after it happened, I felt very confused. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what just happened. So, when I left the clinic, I just wanted to get out.

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

So, what were you confused about?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

I was confused of what happened. The first brush, I thought maybe it was an accident. Second brush, something is not right, but I might be alone with him in that whole shop. I don’t know what to do, closed my eyes, you know. Maybe it would just pass. So, after that, yes, I was confused about what I should do next because of what it will entail. If I report to the police, what would happen, this and that.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Okay. So, based on what I’m hearing you say now, right, after the---whatever happened, right, in the room, you were confused over what you should do, right, and not---whether or not you were molested.

 |
| 

A

 | 

Okay. When that thing happened, my very first thought is, what is happening, okay. Was it an accident? Was I mistaken? Then it really happened, what should I do? I just want to get out of that place. Uh, okay, quite soon after he stopped, I wanted to just put on my clothes and get out. That was then I saw there was another lady at the counter. I didn’t know what to say to her. It was embarrassing. It was a very serious allegation. I didn’t want to say anything. That’s why I left.

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

Q

 | 

When you say your confusion is on the matter, what matter are you referring to?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Being inappropriately touched.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

But Ms. Tay, you just said that you were not confused about that.

 |
| 

A

 | 

I was confused at the situation, not at the particular action. Of course, we will know that---I would know that being touched that way is equivalent to being molested, but at the point of time it happened, I do not know how to react. I do not know what was going on.

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Perhaps, you can clarify apart from---apart from being confused over what to do, were you confused about anything else?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Okay. I don’t know why, but of course, I was sure that I was being touched on my breasts and all that. But for some reason, somehow, I needed affirmation from my friend to tell me, “Yes, this is molest”, which was why I related to her, “I think I got molested”. This person touched me on---on my breasts, all that. What’s your answer? That was kind of---yah, that---that would be kind of the way I would carry things out usually.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Okay. So, if I may try to understand, you’re saying now that you understand that it may not have been completely logical, but at that point in time, you felt that you needed someone to confirm you had been molested.

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes, this was what I’m saying.

 |

  
  

107    I did not accept that the complainant gave different versions about her confusion. In my view, the differences are more apparent than real and essentially stemmed from the way the questions were posed. The complainant was clear on the actions of the accused. As she said, “_I was confused at the situation, not at the particular action._” In my view, the complainant was candid in explaining her confusion. She explained that she ‘was trying to get a grip of what happened’, she felt a certain degree of disbelief over what had happened to her and she was at a loss on how to react. Her confusion and disbelief at what happened is also captured in her message to Florence later the same day where she said, _‘He go and massage my breast and pinch my nipples leh. Got like that one meh._’

108    It is recognised that women do not react to a consistent or common pattern in such trying circumstances. As was held in _Public Prosecutor v Yue Roger Jr_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 749</span> at \[30\], _“… there is no general rule requiring victims of sexual offences to report the offences immediately or in a timely fashion. Instead, the explanation for any such delay in reporting is to be considered and assessed by the court on a case-by-case basis.”_ I did not agree that the complainant’s veracity should be doubted because of the lack of reaction, her failure to complain immediately and the feedback she gave of the session. She explained that she was confused and did not know how to react. She did not complain immediately and gave the positive feedback because her ‘first thought’ was to leave the place. She said it was the ‘easiest course of action to get me out of there as soon as possible’. Had she given negative or neutral feedback, she would have had to address queries from the staff. She gave the following frank answer when asked[^19]:

> Q    What about a neutral face? Would you be asked a lot of questions if you put a neutral---

> A    I believe---

> Q    face?

> A    they would. How is it they can improve, all that? What do you expect me to say?

In the upshot I accepted the following submission of the prosecution:

> The victim’s reasons behind her lack of response and her subsequent actions are entirely consonant within the realm of probabilities. It is perfectly natural for a person in the victim’s situation to be shocked and at a loss on how to react when molested by a masseuse. It is also natural for the victim to have sought to get out of Zhong Kang as soon as possible rather than remain in Zhong Kang and confront the staff immediately. As regards the latter, the victim explained that she did not know which side the staff would take if she complained about the accused.

109    In any case, there was no undue delay in the complainant’s complaint. She informed her close friend, Jia Min, very soon after the massage session when she was asked about the massage. She had specified where she was touched to her and also informed another close friend, Florence, after she returned home. Under s. 159 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97), the complainant’s statements to Jia Min and Florence constituted corroboration of her evidence, although it is not independent of her “and adds little to the prosecution case” (_Tang Kin Seng v PP_ \[1997\] 1 SLR 46).

### Credibility of Complainant

110    I found the complainant to be a forthright and fair-minded witness. She is a matured lady who understood the enormity of her allegation. There was no reason for her to frame the accused. She had initially thought of asking for a refund because in her words, _“Asking for refund, I felt it was technically right, because it was a hard-earned money and nobody wants to have---get into such incident.”_ However, she decided against pursing it as she did not want to step into the TCM Centre again.

111    She was prepared to excuse certain actions of the accused like the massage on her buttocks with her pants and panties pulled down halfway as part and parcel of the treatment although her consent was not obtained. As regards the lifting of the towel to peep at her left breast, she was prepared to give the accused the benefit of the doubt as she felt it may have been an instinctive reaction when she exclaimed in pain. In addition, when the accused’s hand first brushed against her nipple, she wondered if it was accidental. She only ruled it out when it happened a second time and the accused pinched her nipple thereafter.

112    She did not exaggerate the nature of the contact with the sides of her breasts and with her right nipple and the duration. There was no question of a wrong perception on her part. I found that she answered truthfully during the searching cross-examination. I was satisfied that she was a witness of truth.

### (vi)   Credibility of accused and his witness

113    I shall now deal with the evidence of the accused and Fang. There were two planks to the accused’s defence. First, the massage was confined to the sides of the breasts over the towel and it was done at the request of the complainant. Second, he claimed that Xiulian had entered the room to retrieve a device towards the end of the massage, and was presumably suggesting it was therefore impossible that he could have molested the complainant.

114    To begin with, if the complainant had indeed asked him to massage her breasts which he knew was not permitted, the natural response for him would have been to decline the request and to inform Xiu Mei or Xiulian after the massage. Alternatively, he could have told the complainant that he would stop the massage and ask Xiu Mei or Xiulian to assign a female therapist to take over. The accused’s claim that he wanted to appease the complainant for fear of a complaint against him is unbelievable.

115    Both planks of his defence are missing in the statement (D2) which he wrote after the was informed of the allegation and asked to give his account of the massage on the next day, in his police statement (P7) which was recorded about two months later, in his cautioned statement (P8) which was recorded about six months later. In addition, his assertion that Xiulian had entered into the massage room was not even put to her.

116    The accused gave various explanations for his failure to state his version of events. As regards his self-written statement (D2), he claimed that Xiu Mei was trying to draw a clear line between him and the company, he was angry, he had a headache, he wanted to write it as ‘simple and as fast as he could’. In the same breath, he claimed he withheld his defence because he did not want his actions to be misinterpreted as it was against the company’s rules.

117    It was the accused’s evidence that he told Xiu Mei to call the police for him to clarify as he did not do anything wrong. If his stance was he had done nothing wrong and he wanted the police to be involved, it did not make sense for him to deliberately omit the complainant’s request to massage her breasts in D2. This was especially so when he claimed he had only massaged the sides with his thumb over the towel. More significantly, in his first statement to the police (P7), he again failed to state he massaged the sides of the complainant’s breasts to appease her. He sought to explain away the glaring omission by alleging that the atmosphere was wrong because SSI Chin was certain he had committed the offence. He also claimed that he was under ‘huge stress’ then as he was jobless and was suffering from insomnia. It was also the accused’s evidence that he ‘reserved a portion’ of what he wanted to say in P7 in order to consult his friends to avoid saying the ‘wrong things’. The accused gave a detailed statement. He specified that he pressed on the sternum with two fingers and even went to the extent of drawing a diagram to illustrate where he had pressed. The third opportunity which the accused had to state his defence was in the cautioned statement. The accused agreed that he was told to state his defence. Again, he made no mention of the complainant’s alleged request to massage her breasts.

118    I was not impressed by the argument that the accused’s decision to give a materially different account in his testimony despite knowing of his prior inconsistent statements was proof of his honesty. It would be reasonable to expect the accused to mention in his statements that the complainant had asked him to massage her breasts and that he massaged the sides as this was a significant fact. I was satisfied that the late fundamental shift came about only after he procured his ex-colleague, Fang, to be a witness in 2019.

119    The accused claimed he told Fang on the following day (17 December 2017), before the complaint was made, that a customer had asked him to massage her breasts and he did not want to do it as he felt awkward. He said that Fang exclaimed surprise and was agreeable to taking over the customer. On the other hand, Fang started off by testifying that the accused told her that he ‘met a weird customer’ and that he could introduce the customer to her. She did not know why the accused called the customer ‘weird’. Later, she changed her evidence and stated that the accused said, ‘I met a customer yesterday and it’s not convenient for me to do.’ However, he did not tell her why it was inconvenient and neither did she ask. When her prior statement which she made on 12 February 2019 was used to refresh her memory, a third version emerged. In the statement, she stated that the accused told her the customer had asked him to ‘massage the front area’.

120    Fang gave her evidence about seven months after she had made the statement at the law firm. If the accused had indeed told her that a female customer had asked him to massage her breasts, it would have been an unusual request. I found it difficult to accept that Fang could have forgotten about it seven months later, especially when she had given a statement in connection with it.

121    Asked what her understanding of ‘front area’ was, her evidence was that she did not respond to what the accused said and did not put much thought into it. It was also her evidence that it did not cross her mind if the request of the customer was proper. If the accused had informed her of the unusual request, it was hard to believe that it did not evoke any response from her and it was equally unbelievable that it did not strike her mind that the request was improper as the massage of breasts were not permitted.

122    Further, Fang’s evidence that she did not respond was inconsistent with the accused’s evidence. He claimed that Fang exclaimed surprised at the customer’s request and agreed to attend to her on her next appointment. Moreover, their evidence on how their alleged conversation ended was also discrepant. The accused claimed that their conversation was interrupted because Xiu Mei had called him whereas Fang claimed that they stopped because a customer had arrived. I did not think that this was an innocuous discrepancy due to the effluxion of time. Looking at their evidence holistically, it revealed that the accused and Fang were not being truthful.

123    It is noteworthy that the accused did not state in his statement D2, in his police statement P7 and in his cautioned statement D8 that he informed Fang about the complainant’s request. He claimed that he was only able to remember his conversation with Fang in January or February 2019. There was no explanation as to what triggered his memory.

124    As Fang claimed that she did not put much thought into the conversation, she was pressed on how she was able to remember the ‘normal’ conversation about one year later when she made the statement at the law firm. She gave the following responses[^20]:

> Q    … So now, rounding up, this was according to you a normal conversation with Mr. Wang. Am I correct?

> A    Correct.

> Q    So, if this was a normal conversation, how were you able to recall that he told you, “met the customer yesterday and it’s not incon---it’s not convenient for me to do”?

> A    Because there is certainly interaction or communication for a normal conversation because I did not work the previous day so he would certainly tell me about it.

> Q    But my question is how are you able to remember what he said to you if this was just a normal conversation?

> A    I---I don’t know why you are asking such a weird question or saying such a weird thing. We---we talked about it---we talked about this matter.

> Q    Okay, Ms. Fang, I---I’ll just ask you 1 more time, right, you have given evidence this was a normal conversation. So, if this was a normal conversation, how are you able to remember what he said to you?

> A    Why would I not remember because he’s talking about a customer, why would I not remember?

Her responses do not explain why she was able to remember the alleged conversation about more than a year later and yet she was unable to remember what the accused allegedly said about seven months after she gave her statement at the law firm.

125    She was also quizzed on how she was able to state in her statement that she spent some time basking in the sun after she arrived at 10am on 17 December 2017. Fang was very defensive and at one point stated that she did not know. She went on to give irrelevant answers and did not answer the questions. Her answers are set out below[^21]:

> Q    So, would I be right to say that this sentence about basking, it’s based on your daily routine and not what you actually remember happened that day?

> A    Do you---are you referring to---do I really remember what happened that day?

> Q    Yes, Ms. Fang. We are talking about how you---you remember what happened that day.

> A    I don’t know. We were just chatting on the 17th because we will also usually chat before we start work.

> Q    Ms. Fang, I’m not asking you about chatting. I’m asking you about your statement where you say you spent some time basking in the sun outside the store, right? Is that based---is what you say here based on your usual routine or not?

> A    But me basking in the sun has nothing to do with this case. I do this every day before I start work. That is all.

> Q    Okay. Ms. Fang, what you state in D4T has everything to do with this case. So, I ask you again before I move, when you said you spent some time basking in the sun in D4T, is it based on what you actually remember happened or your usual routine?

> A    We indeed spoke about this.

126    The accused confirmed that ultimately he had to obtain the consent of Xiulian or Xiu Mei for the complainant to be reassigned to Fang. If the complainant had indeed made such a request and the accused was unwilling to do so, the natural reaction should have been for him to ask the complainant to book her next appointment with a female masseuse, or at the very least to have informed Xiulian or Xiu Mei to reassign the complainant to another therapist as they were in charge of arranging the schedule of all therapists.

127    I found that the accused failed to reveal his conversation with Fang in his statement D2, P7 and P8 simply because there was no such conversation. Moreover, the various versions that Fang gave of her alleged conversation and the variance between their versions arose because both the accused and her were not being truthful.

### Conclusion

128    In conclusion, I found the evidence of the accused, Fang and her statement D4 to be unworthy of belief. I rejected the accused’s version of what had happened. I found the complainant to be an ‘unusually convincing’ witness and I was satisfied that the charge had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The accused was accordingly found guilty and convicted.

## Address on Sentence

129    The prosecution sought a sentence of 10 months imprisonment and three strokes. It was submitted that the case fell within Band 2 of the _Kunasekaran s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 580</span> (_‘Kunasekaran’_) framework as it involved the intrusion of the victim’s private part. The prosecution highlighted three offence-specific aggravating factors.

#### (i)   Significant degree of sexual exploitation

130    The accused made direct skin-to-skin contact with the sides of victim’s breasts and right nipple.

#### (ii)   Persistence

131    The accused began massaging below the victim’s collarbone, near her breasts. He then lightly squeezed the sides of her breasts for a second or so. Shortly after, he brushed her right nipple twice. Thereafter, he pinched her right nipple.

#### (iii)   Situational vulnerability/abuse of trust

132    On a massage table, clients are vulnerable as they permit masseurs to touch their body for the purpose of massage, but trust that masseurs will avoid the private areas. The accused exploited the victim’s vulnerability and abused the customer-masseur relationship.

133    It was submitted that considering the accused made direct skin-to-skin contact with the victim’s private part, the offence would fall within the higher end of Band 2. The prosecution suggested a sentence of at least 10 months’ imprisonment would be the appropriate indicative starting point. Further, as the accused had intruded upon the victim’s private parts, with direct skin-to-skin contact, it will be appropriate to impose 3 strokes of the cane.

134    As for the offender-specific factors, it was submitted that the absence of previous antecedents is a neutral factor which is not necessarily positive evidence of good character, and should not be taken as a mitigating factor. The accused was also not entitled to the sentencing discount granted to those who plead guilty and spare the victim the trauma of testifying in court. The prosecution submitted that a downward calibration from the indicative starting point of at least 10 months’ imprisonment with three strokes was therefore not warranted.

135    The prosecution referred to the following precedents in support of its sentencing position.

> (a)      _PP v Li Qingdong_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGMC 60</span>

> The offender, a 32-year-old Chinese national, was convicted following a trial on one count of outrage of modesty under s 354(1) Penal Code against a client while he was working as a masseur at a beauty and health centre. The victim, a 46 year old Japanese, had gone to the place for the first-time for a one hour no oil massage with her husband. The victim was attended to by another masseur initially, but mid-way, her masseur left and the offender took over to perform the massage on the victim. The offender had in the course of massaging her inner thigh, used his fingers to touch the victim’s vagina (directly skin to skin) repeatedly under her underwear. He was sentenced to 11 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane.

> (b)      _PP v Sin Tiong Kheng_ (SC-904717-2017)

> The 60-year-old offender molested a 32-year-old female victim in the course of a massage by fondling her breasts for about 20 minutes skin to skin, massaging her inner thighs and rubbing the victim’s vulva from outside her underwear. The victim was confused as to whether the offender was molesting her or massaging her as the offender acted like it was a normal massage, continuously asking her if she felt pain, if the pressure was all right and if it was relieving her pain. She thus did not complain during the touching and massage. The offender was sentenced to 11 months’ imprisonment.

> (c)      _PP v Luke Manimaran Degarajoo_ (SC-908997-2017)

> The 43-year-old offender touched the outer part of the victim's vagina (directly skin to skin) twice with his index finger in the course of performing physiotherapy on her. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 11 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane.

> (d)      _PP v Hu Xidong_ (SC-903297-2017)

> The offender molested a 28-year-old victim during a massage by rubbing her exposed breasts in a circular motion. He repeated this about 10 times, and it lasted for at least a minute. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to nine months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane. There were two s 354(1) charges taken into consideration.

## Mitigation

136    The accused is aged 48 years. He is a Chinese national. He has a five year old daughter and is undergoing divorce proceedings with his Singaporean wife. It was said that for the past two years, the accused’s life has been defined by this singular incident and he has not been able to lead a normal life. As a foreigner facing a charge, he has been staying here on a temporary Visa, and has not been able to work. It was said that considerable strain has been put on his family.

137    A total of 11 letters from 23 persons were tendered to plead for leniency for him. In 2018, the accused was referred to Adullam Life Counselling by a friend. One of the letters was from its President who is also a lead pastor of Live For Eternity Church, where the accused has been worshipping at since 2019. He vouched for the accused as being a ‘good’ man. Another parishioner stated that she observed the accused to be a very caring father who shares a close relationship with his daughter. Another stated that the accused is selfless and willing to go the extra mile for anyone. The writer stated that he sprained his ankle and the accused immediately came to see him the very day to treat his ankle.

138    Learned counsel accepted that the case fell within band 2 of the _Kunasekaran s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 580</span> (_‘Kunasekaran’_) sentencing guidelines. He submitted that the based on the precedents, the range was between six to 11 months imprisonment, but the higher end of the range was where there was an intrusion of the vagina.

139    He referred to _Zeng Guoyuan v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 2 SLR(R) 556</span> where the offender who was an acupuncture and acupressure practitioner was convicted of outraging the modesty of a female client in the course of an acupuncture and acupressure session on five charges under s.354 Penal Code. The first charge involved the offender kissing and biting the victim’s toes on both feet; the second charge involved a kiss on the right cheek; the third and fourth involved the massaging of the left and right breasts; and the last charge involved the massaging of the area near the groin. Upon the offender’s appeal against his conviction and sentence, the conviction was upheld and his total sentence was increased to 27 months’ imprisonment and the total number of strokes of the cane was increased to ten. He also referred to _Lim Cheng Ban v Public Prosecutor_ (Magistrate’s Appeal No. 27 of 2007, \[2007\] SGDC 168) where the offender was convicted after a trial of outraging the modesty of two victims in the course of a massage session. For the first victim, he massaged her breasts with his hands and a guasa plate and touched her vagina with his fingers. As for the second victim, the offender massaged her breasts with his hands and a guasa plate, and lifted the crotch lining of her panty at the left side inner thigh with his fingers. On appeal, the sentences were reduced to six months’ imprisonment on both charges.

## Sentence

140    The prescribed sentence under section 354(1) of the Penal Code is imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years or with fine or with caning or with any combination of such punishments.

## The seriousness of the offence (Offence-specific factors)

141    The three main categories of offence-specific factors which bear upon the assessment of the seriousness of the offence based on the framework applied in _Kunasekaran_ are the degree of sexual exploitation, the circumstances of the offence and the physical or psychological harm caused to the victim.

#### (i)   Degree of sexual exploitation

142    The degree of sexual exploitation includes considerations of the part of the victim’s body that was touched, how it was touched and the duration of the outrage of modesty.

143    Here, there was intrusion of the victim’s private part and also skin-to-skin contact. The contact was with the sides of both breasts and the right nipple.

144    As for the manner and duration, the complainant described the squeezing motion at the sides of both breasts to be light and for a few seconds or so. For her right nipple, she stated the palm brushed over it twice and she described the pinching of the nipple to be light and for a few seconds.

#### (2)   Circumstances of the offence

145    What is significant here is the masseur-customer relationship. Clients are vulnerable as they permit masseurs to touch their body for the bona fide purpose of a massage and trust that the masseurs will not touch their private areas. Here, there was a significant abuse of the trust.

#### (3)   Harm caused to the victim

146    The complainant felt embarrassed and violated. There is no evidence that she suffered from emotional or psychological trauma as a consequence of the incident.

147    It was not in dispute that the present case fell within Band 2 as it involved the intrusion of the victim’s private part. Band 2 has an indicative sentencing range of between five and 15 months’ imprisonment. Based on the skin-to-skin contact and the abuse of trust, in my view, the offence fell within the middle of the band.

148    As regards caning, the High Court in _Kunasekaran_ held that the starting point previously stated in _Public Prosecutor v Chow Yee Sze_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 1 SLR 481</span> (“_Chow Yee Sze_”) “still remains instructive in respect of its guidance that the starting point in respect of the imposition of _caning_ is where the outrage of modesty involves the intrusion upon the victim’s private parts or sexual organs”.

149    As regards the offender specific factors, there were no aggravating factors. As regards the mitigating factors, the accused has no antecedents. As he did not plead guilty, he was not entitled to any sentencing discount in this regard.

150    As regards _Lim Cheng Ban_, it is not known if there were any exceptional circumstances found by the High Court. From the precedents, sentences of 11 months’ imprisonment with three strokes of the cane have been meted out on offenders who intruded upon the victim’s vagina during the massage/treatment (see _PP v Li Qingdong_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGMC 60</span>). Where the intrusion involved the victim’s breasts, a sentence of nine months’ imprisonment with three strokes of the cane was imposed on offenders who pleaded guilty. I agreed with the prosecution that a sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment with three strokes of the cane is appropriate, and sentenced the accused accordingly.
