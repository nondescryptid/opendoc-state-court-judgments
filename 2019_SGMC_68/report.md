## Statement of Facts (“SOF”)

3       Briefly, these were the facts. The victim was an old woman aged 78.

4       On 11 October 2017, at about 3.41 pm, as the Accused approached the signalized T-junction of Maxwell Road and Tanjong Pagar Road (“the signalized T-junction”), Singapore, the traffic light turned red and the Accused stopped the lorry. Soon thereafter, the Accused executed the left turn from Maxwell Road into Tanjong Pagar Road. In doing so, the Accused failed to notice the victim crossing the road (ie pedestrian crossing along Maxwell Road perpendicular to Tanjong Pagar Road) at the signalized T-junction while the traffic light was showing ‘blinking green man’ in favour of the victim. In the process of turning into Tanjong Pagar Road, the left front portion of the Accused’s lorry collided into the victim and the victim fell down.

5       As a result of the accident, the victim suffered (a) comminuted fractures of the shaft of the first metatarsal, the base of the second and third metatarsals, with dislocation and (b) displaced and open fractures of the big toe, second and third toes. The victim had to undergo several surgeries and had her left mid-foot amputated. She was hospitalised for almost one year. She required a wheel chair for mobility.

6       The details of the accident were captured by video footage from a camera operated by the Public Utilities Board (“PUB”). The video footage was screened in open court and was admitted by the Accused. It showed clearly that at the material time there were a number of pedestrians crossing the road from left to right and vice versa. It was a busy pedestrian crossing and the accident happened in an urban setting. The accident happened when there were still pedestrians crossing the road.

7       At the time of accident, the weather was fine, road surface was dry, traffic flow was moderate and visibility was good.

## Antecedents

8       The Accused’s previous traffic offences were dated. His last known record was dated 2001 for the offence of road hogging.

## Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

9       The Prosecution relied on the sentencing framework laid down by the High Court in _PP v Tang Ling Lee \[2018\] 4SLR 813_ and submitted that the present case was within the category 2 sentencing range. It was contended that there was very high harm and medium culpability. The Prosecution submitted for a jail term of 1 week and 18 months’ disqualification order from all classes of driving licences.

## Mitigation

10     Counsel submitted a written mitigation plea.

11     In the mitigation plea, counsel highlighted the circumstances leading to the accident. Counsel submitted the circumstances showed that the victim was negligent and was in breach of the Highway Code by crossing the road during the blinking “green man” phase.

12     It was contended that the Accused had done the “necessary” check but the accident happened as the victim was in his blind spot.

13     Counsel also highlighted that the Accused had a clean record for 16 years since his last traffic offence in 2001.

14     Other mitigating factors contended was that the Accused had pleaded guilty and was remorseful. He had also co-operated fully with the authorities. It was also claimed that any incarceration would affect his livelihood and family.

15     Counsel did not dispute that the present case fell within category 2 of the sentencing range provided in _PP v Tang Ling Lee, supra_. But he submitted that the appropriate sentence should be a fine and a short disqualification order of less than 12 months.

## Sentencing Considerations

16     In determining the appropriate sentence, I applied the sentencing framework set out in _PP v Tang Ling Lee, supra._ It required a two-step inquiry to be undertaken in determining the appropriate sentence. In this case, both parties did not dispute that the present case fell within category 2 sentencing band. Accordingly, the presumptive sentencing range was one to two weeks’ imprisonment. However, it was submitted the presumptive sentencing range did not apply because of the circumstances of the case and mitigating factors. With respect, I disagreed.

17     In support of the submission for a fine, counsel contended that the Accused did the “necessary check”. But he clarified that there was negligence. He also claimed that the victim was in the Accused’s blind spot. With respect, having watched the video footage, it was clear that the Accused, being a driver of the heavy vehicle and making a turn at a busy authorised pedestrian crossing in an urbanized area close to the well-known Maxwell Hawker Centre and in the vicinity of Chinatown should have exercised more caution. Moreover, when the accident happened there were visible pedestrians still crossing in both directions and the pedestrian crossing light was green in favour of the Accused albeit that the green man was flicking. See also the photographs at pages 40 and 41 of the mitigation plea, which showed the situation at that time before the accident and where the victim was clearly visible. It must also be highlighted that the victim was an elderly woman and not one that was expected to walk briskly. The weather was fine, traffic flow was moderate and visibility was good. I also agreed with the Prosecution that the Accused being a lorry driver should have known of the blind spot in his lorry. He should have taken the extra step of checking his blind spot especially when he was making a left turn in the busy city area.

18     Counsel also urged the court to consider the fact that there was no green arrow traffic light on the path of the Accused’s travel. I do not see how this was a factor in his favour as the Accused was required by law to give way to the victim crossing at a designated pedestrian crossing even though the green man light was blinking. In fact, counsel conceded that the victim had the right of way.

19     With due respect, the allegation that the victim was slow in crossing and did not look out for vehicular traffic did have any bearing on the culpability. See _Guay Seng Tiong Nickson v PP <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 1079</span>_ and _PP v Ong Heng Chua <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 388</span>._ I also failed to see how the application of the Highway Code has any bearing on the case as the Accused admitted that the victim had the right of way. See \[6\] of the SOF. In any event, crossing during the blinking phase of the pedestrian crossing light did not contribute to the culpability of the Accused.

20     Considering all the above circumstances, I was of the view that the Accused’s culpability was on the moderate to high side.

21     In term of harm caused, given the injuries suffered, the multiple surgeries, the amputation of the mid-foot and the extensive hospitalization period, it was clearly in the greater harm category. The victim now required a wheelchair for her mobility.

22     In determining the appropriate sentence, I gave credit for the Accused’s plea of guilt, remorsefulness, his co-operation with investigations and having rendered assistance to the victim. I noted there was no question of speeding involved. I also did not view his antecedents negatively. The fact that there was no further traffic violations since 2001 was one factor that I considered favourably in the determination of the appropriate sentence. If not for this factor, I would have ordered a DQ for 2 years.

## Sentencing Precedents

23     I did not find the precedents submitted by the counsel to be very helpful. As highlighted by the High Court in _PP v Ganesan Sivasankar <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 681</span>_, “the appropriate sentence to be imposed will be the product of a fact-sensitive exercise of discretion, taking into account all the circumstances of the case.” In any event, most of the cases cited by counsel were decided before _Tang Ling Lee v PP, supra._

24     Counsel also quoted the unreported case of _PP v Lim Choon Hiang (MAC904903/2019)_ reported in the newspaper where the victim suffered grievous hurt caused by the negligent driving of the offender by failing to keep a proper look out for the victim who was cycling in front of the offender. In that case, the Prosecution categorized it as low to medium culpability and medium to greater harm. The offender was jailed for a week and given a DQ for 2 years. I noted that the offender had a poor driving record unlike the present case which could explain the DQ for 2 years. In the present case, I had considered favourably the Accused’s driving history when determining the sentence. On the other hand, the victim here was an old woman pushing a metal trolley and had her mid-foot amputated. Clearly, the present case is more aggravating than the unreported case.

## Conclusion

25     Given the considerable extent of the harm caused and the level of culpability and having regard to the mitigation plea, I sentenced the Accused to one week’s imprisonment and DQ for 18 months.

26     The Accused is released on bail pending appeal.
