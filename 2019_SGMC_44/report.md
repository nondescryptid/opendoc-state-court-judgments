2       The Accused was the director of SCM Builders Pte Ltd (referred to as “SCM” hereinafter). The allegations in 4 of these 6 charges were that the Accused had received monies separately from the 4 foreign workers for them to work for him. The other two charges were allegations of him receiving monies separately from 2 of the aforementioned workers to continue working for him. In gist, the 4 workers each allegedly gave the Accused monies individually to secure work in the Accused’s company and, additionally, for 2 of them, another subsequent payment of money to continue to work for the Accused’s company.

## The Prosecution’s case

3       The Prosecution called 6 witnesses. PW1 Delepe, PW2 Hossain Faruk, PW3 Mollick Monir and PW4 Das Jhantu Chandra were the 4 alleged victims. They were foreign workers employed by the Accused’s company SCM Builders Pte Ltd. PW5 was a Singaporean, Low Cher Heng (“Steven Low”), who allegedly worked for the Accused as a worksite coordinator. PW6 was the MOM (Ministry of Manpower) Investigating Officer.

#### PW1’s evidence

4       PW1 Delepe is a foreign worker from Bangladesh. According to his passport, he arrived in Singapore on 3 March 2016. He said that it was the boss who had brought him from the airport to a house located at Balestier Road. He went for a medical examination on 5 March 2016 as part of the application to MOM for his work permit to work for SCM. He said the boss had brought him to the clinic for the medical examination. In court, he identified the Accused as the boss. He said he came to know of the boss from information given to him by a friend in Bangladesh. He said that he had to pay $4,000 in order to get the job. He said that he paid the boss the $4,000 near Mustafa (referring to Mustafa Shopping Centre) after the medical checkup. He was shown a photograph of Steven Low. He said that he recognized Steven Low as the person who accompanied the boss on his visits to the house but he did not know what the position of Steven was in SCM.

#### Cross-examination of PW1

5       PW1 was asked if he had been to Singapore prior to March 2016. PW1 said that he came to Singapore for the first time in 1996. Defence Counsel (“DC”) asked if he had to pay any money then. PW1 said he did not have to pay any money then. PW1 confirmed that he had worked in Singapore from 1996 to 2016 and never had to pay anyone any money to work here.

6       On how he was contacted to come to work for SCM, PW1 said he spoke to the boss over the phone. He had obtained the contact information from a friend and spoke to the boss in 2015. It was put to PW1 by DC that the Accused did not have any communication whatsoever with PW1 in 2015 and that only Steven Low was liaising with PW1’s Bangladeshi agent. PW1 disagreed. When asked by DC, PW1 said he could not provide the telephone number of the boss that he communicated with over the phone.

7       When asked who had picked him up when he landed in Singapore, PW1 said that he had contacted the boss and the boss told him to meet at Mustafa Centre. PW1 went to Mustafa Centre and met the boss and the boss brought him to the house at Balestier Road. PW1 believed that this house was rented by the boss for the workers.

8       PW1 cannot remember when he had signed the contract with the company but it was signed at the workers’ quarters. He estimated that it would have been 5 to 6 days after his arrival in Singapore.

9       PW1 revealed that he stopped working either in September or October 2016 due to non-payment of his salary for 3 months. PW1 had lodged a complaint with MOM about this issue and it was subsequently settled. PW1 could not remember which months he was not paid his salary. Although he was owed $4,800 of salary in total, he settled for $800 for personal family reasons.

10     On when the alleged payment of $4,000 to the boss had taken place, PW1 mentioned that it was during the lunch hour. PW1 said he paid the boss in cash of $50 and $100 bills. There was no envelope used and there was no witness to the payment.

11     On when he had first seen DW2 Balamurugan (“Bala”), PW1 estimated it was about 10 to 15 days after his arrival in Singapore. PW1 had seen Bala visit the workers at the quarters at Balestier Road, sometimes alone, sometimes with the Accused. On whether PW5 Steven Low had brought him to the worksites to work or given him instructions on the work to be done, PW1 said no.

12     It was put to PW1 that he did not hand any monies to the Accused and that the Accused was not even with PW1 on 5 March 2016, the day of the alleged payment. PW1 disagreed.

13     When asked who had sent him the MOM In-Principle Approval (“IPA”) for PW1 to come to Singapore, PW1 said that it was the Accused who had sent it to his email address which he had given to the Accused. It was suggested to PW1 that it was Steven Low who had sent the IPA to him, PW1 said that he did not know who Steven Low was. When asked to provide the email address of the Accused, PW1 was not able to. DC informed PW1 that the Accused had an email dated 22 December 2015 in which the Accused had sent the IPA to Steven Low and that it was Steven Low who had forwarded the IPA to PW1’s agent in Bangladesh.

14     PW1 was asked by DC that if PW1 did not know Steven Low, how was it that Steven Low had his passport particulars which were forwarded to the Accused. PW1 said that he is not aware of whose email address “chlowsteve@gmail.com” belonged to but that he was told by the Accused to send his particulars to that email address.

15     There was no re-examination by the Prosecutor of PW1.

#### PW2’s evidence

16     PW2 is Hossain Faruk. On 8 October 2015, he arrived in Singapore to work for SCM. He went for his medical appointment on 9 October 2015. PW2 said that the boss took $5,000 from him but told him that there was no work for him in the company and to source for his own work. Furthermore, PW2 was told to pay the boss the levy of $1,200 at the end of each month for him to work in Singapore.

17     As to how PW2 got to secure this job with SCM, he said that it was through a friend in Bangladesh whose name is “Raju”. PW2 said that the condition of paying $5,000 to get the job with SCM in Singapore was told to him by “Raju”. PW2 understood the payment of the $5,000 was to get him a work permit to work in Singapore. He was informed by “Raju” that his application for work permit was successful.

18     PW2 said that he was told to come to Singapore by the boss. The boss had called Raju in Bangladesh and PW2 was with him. PW2 also spoke to the boss over the phone and the boss told him to come to Singapore.

19     On the payment of the $5,000 to the boss, PW2 said he cannot remember the date but it was a few days after his arrival in Singapore. The payment was made inside the storeroom of the office. One year later, PW2 said that he was told to pay $3,000, otherwise his work permit would be cancelled. The $3,000 was also paid in the office but at a different location. This time, it was paid to the boss in the presence of Bala.

#### Cross-examination of PW2

20     In cross-examination, PW2 testified that he first came to Singapore in 2000. He did not have to pay any agency or employer to work here for about 15 years. When asked if PW2 had to pay Raju, he said he did not. When asked how he could confirm that Raju knew his boss, PW2 said that he had seen Raju regularly contacting his boss over the telephone. As to how PW2 knew that it was the boss who was on the other side of the line, PW2 said that it was Raju who told him so.

21     When asked if Raju could have been referring to Steven Low as the boss on the other side of the line, PW2 said it was the boss and not Steven Low because Raju said that he was talking to the boss and that is how PW2 knew it was the boss.

22     PW2 said in cross-examination that he had only met the boss a total of 3 times, twice in the office and once in Balestier. The first time, he went to the office by taxi based on the address given to him by Raju. At the office, he saw the boss with Steven Low. The second time he saw the boss, it was also at the office but he can’t remember if anyone else was with the boss.

23     When asked by DC if he had seen the boss these 3 times only, PW2 said that these were the 3 times he met the boss to make the payments but besides that, he also met the boss every month when he collected the levy. The DC pointed out to him that earlier he had only said he met the boss 3 times and now he had changed his evidence to say that he had met him more than 3 times. PW2 sought to clarify that he had met the boss when he collected the levy and that Bala was with the boss.

24     DC asked PW2 if he had met up with other co-workers of SCM at any time together in a group, PW2 said that he only met the co-workers at the house he was staying in at Balestier Road. At this juncture, DC showed him a photograph of him and other workers in the office. When asked if this was the first time he had met the boss in the office, PW2 said that it was not.

25     PW2 claimed that he had met the boss a few days after his arrival. When asked by DC to be more specific, PW2 said that he met the boss for the first time about 4 to 6 days after his arrival in Singapore, after he had finished his medical. DC pointed out to him that he had arrived in Singapore on 8 October 2015 and that he had told the MOM investigators that the date he had given the Accused the $5,000 was the 9th of October 2015. Therefore, PW2 was lying.

#### Re-examination of PW2

26     In re-examination, PW2 was asked by the Prosecutor if he could recall how many days after his arrival in Singapore on 8 October 2015 that he had met the boss. PW2 replied that he could not remember exactly because it was 2 years ago but he can remember that it was about 4 to 5 days after his arrival in Singapore. The Prosecutor did not pose any other questions.

#### PW3’s evidence

27     PW3 is Mollick Monir. He came to Singapore to work for SCM on 30 October 2015. On the day of his arrival, he went for a medical check-up. He started working for SCM from 4 November 2015. He was paid a monthly salary of $1,600. PW3 got to know of this job from one of his Bangladeshi friends by the name of “Raju”. Raju gave him the phone number of the boss.

28     PW3 said that he needed to pay $5,000 to his boss in order to get the job. He paid the $5,000 to the Accused inside the car after his medical check-up. PW3 said that the promise was for the work permit validity to be for two years. However, the validity period for his work permit was one year and before the expiry of his permit, the boss demanded another $3,000 from him and he paid. (_Note: MOM Prosecutor confirmed later during the cross-examination by DC of PW2 that the work permit was issued by MOM to Mollick Monir on 5 November 2015 and the date of expiry was 25 October 2017, 2 years later_.) PW3 said that he made this payment of $3,000 on 21 October at around 9pm at the company dormitory or company house. He could not remember the year and agreed with the Prosecutor when she suggested that a year later would mean 2016.

29     PW3 was shown a photo of a man and he recognized that man to be Steven. PW3 did not know what exactly Steven worked as but he had seen him with the Accused and he had overheard that Steven was one of the partners of his boss.

#### Cross-examination of PW3

30     Asked by DC, PW3 said that he had started working in Singapore from 1999. He did not have to pay any agency or employer to come and work in Singapore. This was the first time he paid. DC asked PW3, with his experience of working Singapore, if he would have to pay someone to get a job, PW3 answered that he would not need to pay. So, DC asked why he had to pay for this job with SCM and his answer was that he agreed to pay because of the higher salary of $1,600.

31     In the course of the cross-examination, PW3 claimed that he had messages in his phone from the Accused demanding for the payment of $3,000. The phone was seized in court and shown to the Prosecutor and the DC. It turned out that there were no messages demanding for payment but there was only one message. (Printout of the screenshot of this message from “Big Boss” dated 18 October 2016 in the hand phone was marked and admitted as P8.) In this one message, the Accused had informed PW3 that, if the subcontractor (for which PW3 had been sent to work for) could not settle SCM’s invoice, the Accused would not be able to extend PW3’s contract (which was for one year).

32     Asked if he had liaised with the Accused when PW3 was in Bangladesh, he gave an affirmative answer. As to how the communication was made, PW3 said he first made contact with his agent “Raju” who gave him the contact number of the Accused. Thereafter, PW3 contacted the Accused directly. When asked when that was, PW3 said he could not remember.

33     DC asked PW3 if he knew that it was Steven who was dealing with “Raju”. PW3 said he did not know. When asked if PW3 remembered when his in-principle approval was granted, PW3 could not remember. PW3 said that he was informed of the approval by his boss. His boss had asked him to provide his email ID and the boss sent the approval letter to that email ID.

34     In the course of the cross-examination of PW3, the DC produced an audio recording of a conversation that PW3 had with the Accused in the presence of Bala. In this conversation on 16 August 2017 at the office, there was a discussion of Steven’s role and involvement with the foreign workers. In this conversation, PW3 said that he thought Steven was the boss because of the way he was giving directions to PW3.

35     PW3 confirmed that the two men in the recorded conversation were him and the Accused. (It is not in dispute that the voice of “Man 2” named in the transcript Exhibit D7 is that of PW3). When asked by DC why he seemed to be afraid of Steven, PW3 denied being afraid of Steven but he knew that Steven Low was a partner of the Accused. So when Steven gave him an instruction, he felt compelled (to follow). It was put to PW3 that all the work instructions were given to him by Steven. PW3 disagreed.

36     DC put to PW3 that he left the employment of SCM on 1 November 2016. PW3 said that he could not remember the date he had left the company SCM. DC asked PW3 why he had to leave the company SCM when he claimed that he had paid the Accused the $3,000 on 21 October 2016. PW3 said that he left because he was afraid that the Accused would use gangsters to threaten and send him back to Bangladesh.

37     PW3 was then asked by DC that, since he was afraid that the Accused might threaten him with gangsters, why PW3 had gone to the office of the Accused on 16 August 2017 to ask the Accused if he could re-employ PW3. PW3 denied asking the Accused to re-employ him. He had gone to the office to get a transfer letter from the Accused so that he can transfer to another company. PW3 wanted the Accused to sign the transfer letter.

38     PW3 was shown the photo (Exhibit D2) taken on 24 January 2016 showing a group of foreign workers in the office of the Accused. It was put to him that that was the first time that the Accused had met him. He disagreed. It was also put to PW3 that it was Steven who had dealt with him on all the work-related matters including any payments of money. PW3 disagreed and said that he had only met Steven once and that was the day when he gave his thumbprint at MOM. That was the only time he had any conversation with Steven. DC put it to PW3 that he was lying since PW3 had complained about Steven’s behaviour and interaction with him to the Accused in the audio recording of 16 August 2017.

#### Re-examination of PW3

39     In re-examination, PW3 said that Bala was there when he had the conversation with the Accused at the office. PW3 did not know that the conversation was being recorded. As for the photo exhibit D2, PW3 cannot remember when it was taken.

#### PW4’s evidence

40     PW4 is Das Jhantu Chandra. He came to Singapore on 24 February 2016 for work. He went for his medical on 26 February 2016 and for his MOM appointment on 1 March 2016. PW4 said that he came to know of the job opportunity with SCM through one of his friends, Hashem, in Bangladesh. Hashem told him that he needed to pay $5,500 in order to get the job at SCM. It was Hashem who had informed him of the approval for him to come to work in Singapore.

41     Before his arrival in Singapore, he was told that someone would pick him up nobody turned up. Instead, he was given an address by SMS and he proceeded to the house at Balestier Road.

42     PW4 testified that he had paid Hashem 150,000 Bangladeshi taka because Hashem had told him that only by paying this 150,000 to the company boss in Singapore that he would be able to come to Singapore. Since he managed to come to Singapore, Hashem must have sent the money to the boss. Hashem had also told him to pay $3,500 to the boss when he came to Singapore.

43     PW4 testified that he paid the $3,500 to the boss in Singapore inside the car of the boss, at a minimart near the Mustafa Centre. About 10 to 12 days later, he received his work permit. He did not work for SCM but was supplied to another company. His salary was paid by Bala and it was Bala who told him which worksites to report to. PW4 did not recognize the person of Steven when his photo was shown to him.

#### Cross-examination of PW4

44     In cross-examination by the DC, PW4 said that the first time he came to work in Singapore was in 1998. He had never had to pay anyone any money for any employment or re-employment in Singapore and this was the first company he paid. The reason he paid this company was because he was offered a salary of $1,600.

45     When asked by the DC about the payment to the boss in the car, PW4 said that the boss had picked him up from the house and while they were in the car, he paid the money to the boss. The DC asked if he had been inside the car all the while from the time he was picked up from the home to the time he passed the money to the Accused. PW4 answered in the affirmative. At this point, the DC put it to him that he was lying. PW4 said that he was not lying and that they were near a minimart near Mustafa Centre and that he was there to collect the money from someone.

46     The DC pointed out to him that he had confirmed that he did not come out of the car before paying the money to the Accused. PW4 then explained that he had collected the money from the minimart and gone back to the house. The boss subsequently picked him up from the house and he made the payment inside the car. The DC then reminded him that he had earlier said that he went to collect money from the minimart and waited for the boss. The boss came and he went inside the car and paid him.

47     Next, the DC asked PW4 how he had collected the money from the minimart. PW4 said that one of Hashem’s men passed him the money near the minimart. Hashem had told him that the money was needed for him to pay to his boss. The amount he was given was $3,500 in notes of hundred dollars and fifty dollars.

48     When the DC asked PW4 when he had collected this money, he said that it was in the afternoon of 25th and the payment to the boss was made on the 26th. PW4 said that he collected the money from the minimart and kept the money with him at home for one day. The boss met him on the next day and he paid him.

49     The DC put it to PW4 that he was lying and that no payment was ever made to the Accused. PW4 disagreed. DC suggested to PW4 that he had told MOM that he had paid the Accused the amount of $5,500 on 25 February 2016. PW4 said that he had made a mistake as to the date. When asked if PW4 had complained to MOM that he had paid the amount of $5,500, PW4 said that he can’t remember exactly.

#### Re-examination of PW4

50     Nothing significant was clarified in re-examination.

#### PW5’s evidence

51     PW5 is Steven Low. Steven testified that he was a Site Coordinator. He had worked for the Accused for a few months – about 5 to 6 months in 2015. He stopped working for the Accused around November 2015, after Bala was engaged as a supervisor by the Accused.

52     On the recruitment of foreign workers from Bangladesh, Steven said that he had contacts in Bangladesh who were agents. These agents would be the ones to source for workers in Bangladesh. They would send the bio-data of workers to him and he would pass the bio-data to the Accused. It was the Accused who decided which worker to employ.

53     Steven recognized Hossain Faruk (PW2) as he had brought him for his medical and also brought him to the office after his arrival in Singapore. Likewise, for Mollick Monir (PW3), Steven had brought him for his medical after he had arrived in Singapore. Steven also did the same for Das Jhantu Chandra (PW4).

#### Cross-examination of PW5

54     Steven confirmed that “Raju” was an agent in Bangladesh he was liaising with all the while for the workers that have been mentioned in this trial. Steven testified that the air tickets for the workers to come to Singapore were arranged by the agents and not by the workers. When the workers arrived in Singapore, Steven would be the one to bring them for their medical check-ups. After their medical check-ups, Steven would bring them to the office.

55     Steven also confirmed that the workers would report at the office where the Accused would then interview them. Steven was asked about the contact numbers for these workers and whether the Accused would have them. Steven answered that it was he (Steven) who had the contact numbers of the workers and not the Accused. It was only after Steven had left the company of the Accused that the Accused contacted the workers directly.

56     Steven confirmed that the Accused would not have any contact with the workers before they flew into Singapore.

### DPP’s applications just before the close of the Prosecution’s case

57     After all the Prosecution Witnesses had given their evidence and in the light of the testimonies of PW2, PW3 and PW4, the Prosecution applied to amend the charges in DAC 903332/2018, DAC 903333/2018, DAC 903334/2018 and DAC 903338/2018. These were amendments to the dates and to the amounts of cash involved.

58     For the charges involving Hossain Faruk (PW2), the date of handing over $5,000 to the Accused was changed from a specified date of 9 October to a range of a few days after 8 October 2015 in DAC 903332/2018. For DAC 903333/2018, the date of handing over of $3,000 was amended from 8 October to 20 October 2015, _i.e._ 12 days later. For the charge involving Das Jhantu Chandra (PW4) in DAC 903334/2018, the date was changed from 25 February to 26 February 2016 and the amount involved was amended from $5,500 to $3,500. For the charge involving Mollick Monir (PW3) in DAC 903338/2018, the date of handing over the $5,000 was amended from 29 October to 30 October 2015.

59     These applications were met with justifiable objections from the Defence Counsel. Nevertheless, after weighing the relevant factors against the prejudicial effects, I ruled in favour of the Prosecution.

60     At the close of the Prosecution’s case, despite the poor quality of the evidence adduced, the Accused was nevertheless called upon to enter his Defence as the evidence satisfied the _prima facie_ standard of proof at this stage of the proceedings.

## The Defence’s case

61     The Accused elected to give evidence in his Defence. He also called one witness, DW2, for his Defence. In essence, the Accused denied the allegations. He denied demanding any monies from the workers. He did not receive any money from any one of the 4 workers.

62     The Accused did not have any contact with Hossain Faruk before he arrived in Singapore and only met him a few weeks after his arrival. It was Steven who had provided the Accused with his biodata and passport particulars through emails. It was also Steven who brought the worker for his medical and arrange for his accommodation.

63     After Hossain Faruk had worked for one year, the Accused found his work performance to be below expectations. He told Hossain to go back to Bangladesh and the Accused would decide whether to extend his contract for another year. Subsequently, before the Accused could extend his contract, Hossain was caught working illegally by an MOM site raid on 2 November 2016 and his work permit was revoked and cancelled.

64     For Das Jhantu Chandra, it was Steven who received this worker and brought him for medical and getting the Safety Orientation Certificate ready. The Accused said that he had only met Das Jhantu Chandra about 3 to 4 weeks after he had arrived in Singapore. The Accused had only met him at the workers’ dormitory with other workers. The Accused had never driven him in his car.

65     For Delepe, the Accused met him 3 to 4 weeks after he had obtained his work permit card. The Accused saw him at the dormitory at Balestier. This worker Delepe went missing together with 4 other workers and the Accused had to make a police report (Exhibit D8). The workers had gone missing after the Accused had informed his workers that he will not be renewing the contracts for those who had performed below par in their work. Delepe was one of those workers who had not performed well.

66     For Mollick Monir, the Accused saw him for the first time on 24 January 2016, as shown in the video played in court. The Accused testified that he did not take any money from the worker Mollick Monir.

67     In early 2017, this worker Mollick together with 6 other workers had reported the Accused to MOM about the alleged receipt of monies. To the Accused, they had colluded to make this false report. The Accused also testified that this worker had asked for a transfer to another company and the Accused obliged by signing the transfer form in August 2017. After endorsing the transfer form, the worker Mollick called the Accused to meet him. The Accused decided to take the opportunity to record the meeting in order to expose his false allegations. The Accused instructed Bala to do the recording (exhibit D6) and the transcript is found in Exhibit D7.

#### Cross-examination of the Accused (DW1)

68     In the main, the Prosecuting Officer challenged the evidence of the Accused and pointed out to him that many material aspects of his defence were not put to the relevant witnesses when they were on the stand.

69     The Accused was also asked if he is alleging that Steven had colluded with the workers to make false allegations against him. The Accused clarified that he was not saying that Steven had colluded with the workers to frame him. In fact, when he mentioned collusion, it was in reference to Delepe and 4 other workers (not including Mollick, Hossain or Das Jhantu).

70     When asked if the Accused had informed his counsel about his suspicion that the workers had colluded to frame him, the Accused said he did not.

#### DW2’s evidence

71     DW2 is Tharmalingam Balamurugan and he is also known as Bala. Bala was employed by the Accused as the Operations Manager of the company from 26 February 2016. Bala testified that he and the Accused met the workers Delepe and Das Jhantu Chandra together for the first time at the dormitory at Balestier Road. Bala also testified that he was the one who drove the Accused to meet the workers. Bala was staying with the Accused at his home at Yunan Road.

72     Bala recounted that on 21 October 2016, the Accused and him had gone to the workers’ dormitory where the Accused informed the workers there that he will not be renewing their contracts. On 24 October 2016, several workers did not turn up for work. They were also not in their rooms at the dormitory. The Accused and Bala tried calling them on their mobile phones but some of the lines were switched off and other lines were not answered. Bala managed to contact Mollick using a public phone and Mollick told him that he had gone for a medical appointment at the hospital. Mollick said that he will return to the dormitory. However, when he returned, he was not able to produce any MC (Medical Certificate) and Bala believed he was lying about visiting the hospital.

73     Bala testified that Jhantu had failed to report for work on 31 October 2016. The following day, Jhantu called the Accused and finally a meeting was arranged to meet the Accused and Bala at the office. When Jhantu was at this meeting, the workers who had gone missing since 24 October 2016 called Jhantu to find out what the Accused was saying to him. The Accused and Bala decided that the worker Jhantu was a problematic worker and they decided to send him back to Bangladesh. Before proceeding to the airport to send Jhantu back to Bangladesh, the Accused, Bala and Jhantu went to a police station to lodge a report about the missing workers.

74     Bala testified that he had heard Delepe influencing the other workers and instigated them not to go to work. Some of the workers listened to Delepe and either resigned or went missing from work.

75     As for Hossain Faruk, Bala did talk to him but he did not say anything about the company or the Accused.

#### Cross-examination of DW2

76     Bala was extensively cross-examined about his recording of the conversation of the Accused with Mollick Monir. Bala said that the purpose of the recording was to establish from Mollick who the real boss was. Mollick did not know and thought that Steven was since it was Steven who had made arrangements for the medical check-ups for the workers and other issues pertaining to the foreign workers. Bala said that Mollick had told him that the Accused had not obtained any money from him and this was even before the recording of D7.

77     Bala was asked by the Prosecutor if he was aware that the Accused had received kickbacks from the 4 workers Delepe, Mollick, Hossain and Das Jhantu Chandra. Bala’s answer was that he did not know about this for Hossain Faruk and Mollick Monir as these two had joined the company before Bala started working for the company. However, for Delepe and Das Jhantu Chandra, Bala was certain that the Accused did not obtain any kickbacks from them.

## Reasons for the Acquittal

78     There are no legal presumptions to shift the burden of proof in this case from the Prosecution to the Accused. Therefore, the burden is on the Prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused had committed the alleged acts. The burden is not on the Accused to prove his innocence.

79     In cases where it is a question of one man’s word against another, the Court has a duty to carefully scrutinize the testimony of the victims and be satisfied that the Accused could be convicted on the victims’ evidence alone. The allegations levelled at the Accused are very serious and there can be no reasonable doubts if he is to be convicted.

80     After reviewing the facts and circumstances of this case, there were reasonable doubts in the Prosecution’s case against the Accused being guilty of the offences. This is a case of each foreign worker’s word against the word of the Accused. There are no independent witnesses to the hand-over of the monies in cash for each alleged occasion. There is no documentary proof.

#### Reasonable doubts in the testimonies of the 4 workers

81     I begin with several common observations about the testimonies of all 4 workers. Their evidence about the first contact with the Accused individually were rather similar in that they somehow got to communicate with the Accused through their agents in Bangladesh and he demanded monies from them which they readily and unquestionably acceded to. When asked about how the contacts were made, their responses were conspicuously bereft of details of the telephone numbers used, the lack of email addresses by which they claimed they had received instructions about coming to Singapore, etc. As to whether the person they were communicating with in Singapore was “the Boss” or how they knew that “the Boss” was the Accused and not someone else such as Steven, they were unable to provide any reasonable basis for their assumption that they were speaking or communicating with the Accused.

82     As for their knowledge of who Steven was and whether they had interacted much with him, the common refrain from every one of the 4 workers was that Steven was a peripheral figure. Every one of these 4 workers appears bent on identifying the Accused as “the Boss” and denying their interactions with Steven.

83     Next, there was a significant commonality of these 4 workers in that they had been to Singapore to work before without paying a cent to any agency or employer. PW1 Delepe first came to Singapore in 1996 to work. PW2 Hossain started working in Singapore in the year 2000. PW3 Mollick had worked in Singapore since 1999 and PW4 Das Jhantu was in Singapore from 1998. These workers had the experience of working in Singapore for many years. Yet, not one of them had queried why they had to pay the Accused such large sums of monies to be employed. If they were all new to working in Singapore or had made similar payments to other employers, it would not be surprising for them to accept such illegal practices. Furthermore, none of them raise even a hint of protest but merely agreed to pay so readily.

#### The evidence of the 4 workers materially inconsistent with the evidence of PW5

84     The evidence of the Prosecution’s own witness PW5 significantly and severely undermined the evidence of PW1 to PW4. PW5 Steven confirmed on the witness stand that he was the one who dealt with the agent in Bangladesh and not the Accused. Steven admitted that he was the one who had brought these 4 workers for their medical check-ups after their arrival in Singapore. Steven agreed that these workers did not and would not have contacted the Accused before their arrivals in Singapore.

85     It is not in dispute that Steven was the site supervisor involved in the arrangements for the accommodation and overseeing the deployment of the workers when Steven was working for the Accused. It is baffling, to say the least, for the 4 workers to feign ignorance of Steven’s involvement and the contacts they had with Steven. Steven Low Cher Heng had admitted to being more involved with the workers than they were prepared to admit and this raises a serious doubt as to their credibility as trustworthy witnesses. Steven was very clear in his testimony that he was the one who liaised with the agents in Bangladesh via phone calls and emails, in order to arrange for their arrivals in Singapore. Of course, the final decision whether to employ any foreign worker rested with the Accused but that did not mean that Steven was not involved intimately with the shortlisting or identifying potential workers and seeing to the arrangements of bringing the workers to Singapore. It is to be noted that the email address “chlowsteve@gmail.com” to which communications were exchanged with the agents and workers belonged to Steven. Steven was also certain that the agents procured the air tickets for the workers and not the workers themselves.

86     PW5’s affirmative evidence that he had brought the workers for the medical check-ups after their arrivals in Singapore cast into grave doubt the evidence of PW1 Delepe that it was the Accused who had brought him from the airport to the Balestier Road house and that it was the Accused who had brought him to the clinic for the medical examination. In fact, PW1’s evidence that the Accused had picked him up from the airport was subsequently contradicted by his own evidence in cross-examination that the Accused had met him at Mustafa after he landed in Singapore.

#### Defence was able to raise reasonable doubts although there might be gaps in the cross-examination of the Prosecution Witnesses

87     Moving on to the Defence. It is pertinent to note that the alleged payments were not seen or heard by any other persons who could provide direct corroborative or contradictory accounts of the actual incidents, except for the payment allegedly made by Hossain Faruk in the presence of Bala, for which Bala had testified to be untrue. Therefore, if the alleged acts did not occur, there is not much that the Accused could say or do to rebut the allegations beyond an emphatic denial.

88     In this case, the Court is not left with merely choosing between the bare assertions of the Prosecution Witnesses or the Accused and nothing more. The Defence was able to provide indirect but credible evidence which made it unsafe to accept the evidence of the Prosecution Witnesses.

89     The Accused produced D6 and D7 which discredited PW3 Mollick in terms of putting in doubt PW3’s evidence about being certain that the Accused was “the Boss”. Also, why would PW3 go back to the Accused to get a transfer letter if the Accused had not fulfilled his so-called agreement with him of a two-year contract for $5,000 and then subsequently, the $3,000 for a one-year employment?

90     Moving on to PW2. PW2 Hossain claimed that the 2nd payment of $3,000 was made in the presence of Bala. The Accused was able to call DW2 Bala to testify that such an alleged meeting and payment never took place. Even though the Prosecutor tried to say that Bala cannot be trusted since he was still under the employment of the Accused, there was nothing raised by the Prosecution to cast Bala’s testimony in doubt or to show that Bala was not a credible witness.

## Conclusion

91     At the end of the trial, regardless of how the investigations were carried out, it is the evidence or lack thereof adduced at trial which must decide the guilt or innocence of the Accused. This could well be the reason for the Prosecutor being put in the unenviable position of having to apply for significant and material amendments to several of the charges at the close of the Prosecution’s case before the Court could call upon the Accused to enter his defence to the charges. Amendments to crucial elements of when exactly the payments were made and how much was paid, did not speak well of the thoroughness of the evidence-gathering process.

92     The investigations seemed to have stopped short of verifying the veracity of the statements of the witnesses, seeking to probe into the relevant details such as contact particulars, telephone communications, exact locations and possibly the source of the not insignificant funds the workers claimed to have to be able to pay the Accused. It seemed to have been assumed that these workers must be telling the truth the moment several of them pointed their fingers at the Accused and they appeared to be saying the same thing.

93     Regardless of how well or otherwise the Prosecution or the Defence have conducted their respective cases and regardless of how much or how little they have covered or not covered in terms of all the relevant points, the burden is on the Prosecution, in the absence of any legal or evidential presumptions, to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt against the Accused on each and every one of the charges. The Prosecution may have been able to raise many valid points in their closing submissions about the inadequacies of the way the Defence had been conducted and for failing to put its case to the witnesses, the burden remains with the Prosecution.

94     Ultimately, in this case, it was whether the Court could rely upon the testimonies of the foreign workers and be certain they had actually paid the Accused the monies to secure their employment in Singapore. The Prosecution had not been able to prove _beyond a reasonable doubt_ that the Accused is guilty of the charges. With the many significant doubts expressed above, it is unsafe to find the Accused guilty of the offences he had been charged with. The Accused was thereby given an acquittal on all the charges.
