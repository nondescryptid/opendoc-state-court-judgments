Civil Procedure – Discontinuance – Reinstatement application

7 September 2022

### Deputy Registrar Liu Zeming (delivering the judgment of the court _ex tempore_):

1       This is the Plaintiff’s application to reinstate the action pursuant to Order 21 r 2(8) of Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (“**ROC 2014**”).

2       The action was commenced on 10 December 2020. It relates to the Plaintiff’s claim for personal injuries arising out of a road traffic accident which happened on 30 September 2018. On 26 January 2021, parties consented to interlocutory judgment being entered against the Defendant, for 80% of the damages to be assessed and costs (the “**IJ**”). The IJ was extracted on 17 March 2021. Thereafter, the Plaintiff obtained directions for assessment of damages, pursuant to which parties filed their respective lists of documents on 18 May 2021. That was the last step taken in this action. On 19 May 2022, the action was deemed-discontinued pursuant to Order 21 r 2(6) of ROC 2014. On 12 August 2022, this application for reinstatement was filed. The relevant timelines are as follows:

3       The Plaintiff did not file any affidavit in support of his application. His lawyer (the “**PC**”) filed an affidavit instead and gave the following reasons for the failure to take any step in the proceedings after the Trigger Date:

> I shall now narrate the lapse. The file was handled by a staff of the firm **from November 2021 to end of June 2022**. Due to the Covid-19 situation and the pandemic that was prevalent with some members of the staff having contracted with Covid-19, **from September 2021 to June 2022, we adopted the work from home (WFH) policy** in line with the government’s advisory to prevent and reduce the impact of the infection amongst staff and their family members.

> In doing so, this Plaintiff’s file was in the care of the staff who was also working on that basis, and **she too had contracted Covid-19**. As a result, she was not in the office most of the time and therefore did not have access to the physical file. **The particular staff took longer than usual to recover and was on prolonged medical leave**. Thereafter we got to learn that members of her family also got the virus one after the other. As \[sic\] result she had no one to look after her child and therefore **went on long leave to care for \[sic\] child**. **Subsequently her health took a toll, and she was on long leave**. The firm had reminded her of her long absenteeism from work. Due to overwhelm of case files being unattended from April to June 2022, **the staff subsequently resigned in end June 2022**. She did not inform us of the Plaintiff’s claim being lapsed due to auto-discontinuance on 18 May 2022. It only came to light after I had pull out all the files under the staff’s care and went through each and every one of them, that I discovered the lapse for the Plaintiff’s file/suit to my utter shock and disappointment.

> As the only other lawyer in my office, I had to attend to all the court matters and the other files managed by my other staff in the firm as well as, doing all the court litigation work of the firm….**Because of the lapse by the staff, who overlooked this file, the file was not brought to my attention earlier for me to have acted on it**. This went beyond my control with the most unfortunate twist of date of the Plaintiff’s action being lapsed.

> **This has been unprecedented times when we are faced with a pandemic’** **s** **situation \[sic\] and where the safety of all my staffs were of my paramount concern and therefore following the government’** **s** **advisory on the workflow management to prevent and reduce the risk of Covid-19 spread, allowed my staff to work from home (WFH) that resulted in this one file to fall through the cracks and got lapsed.**

> I am therefore urging the Court to allow the Plaintiff’s action / claim to be re-instated on account that the lapse was indeed unfortunate due to unforeseen circumstances and not deliberate or a total disregard to not move the suit expeditiously \[sic\]. This was due to an inadvertent oversight as I have explained above caused during the unprecedented of times; never before experienced by anyone here. I am no exception.

(emphasis added; emphasis in original omitted)

4       In short, the explanation proffered by PC is that his staff who was in charge of the Plaintiff’s file (the “**Staff**”) was, at various points in time between November 2021 to June 2022, unwell and/or absent from work for personal reasons and as a result, the Plaintiff’s file fell through the crack. I note it is also PC’s position that the situation was somehow exacerbated (if not caused) by the work-from-home (“**WFH**”) arrangement implemented at PC’s law firm “_following the government’s advisory_” in order to “_reduce the risk of Covid-19 spread_” (see \[3\] above).

5       In addition, there was a reference in the Plaintiff’s written submissions filed on 6 September 2022 that at a certain point after the Trigger Date the Plaintiff had informed his lawyers that he was “_still receiving and going for treatments for his knee injury_” and hence, there “_may be more documents and/or medical reports needed to assess his condition further_”.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) It was at this stage that the WFH policy was implemented and the rest of the events were as narrated in PC’s affidavit.

6       Based on the reasons proffered, I cannot allow the reinstatement.

7       I am prepared to accept that the Plaintiff acted with reasonable expedition prior to the Trigger Date. However, the Plaintiff must also satisfy this court that his inaction _since the Trigger Date_ is excusable: see _Moguntia-Est Epices SA v Sea-Hawk Freight Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 4 SLR(R) 429</span> (“**_Moguntia_**”) at \[21\]. On this, I am conscious that the court is not looking for a blameless plaintiff, but merely one whose omission _deserves_ to be forgiven: see _Ng Ah Lay v Dumoulin Leon (Dumoulin Charles Leopold Elizabeth)_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGDC 262</span> (“**_Ng Ah Lay_**”) at \[10\]. But even so, I am unable to conclude that the Plaintiff’s inaction is excusable in this case.

8       First, no good explanation was given for the 6-month inaction between the Trigger Date and November 2021, when the Staff was allegedly put in charge of the Plaintiff’s file. Insofar as the inaction was due to the neglect of the Staff, this could not have been the case prior to November 2021. There was simply nothing done to progress the case for 6 months after the Trigger Date. The assertion that the Plaintiff was “_still receiving and going for treatments for his knee injury_” (which is evidence from the bar, no less) is neither here nor there because the matter could clearly still have progressed in parallel with these treatments. More importantly, in the overall context of this case, it is clear to me that this is not the real or dominant reason for the inaction.

9       Second, the health issues and personal circumstances of the Staff are simply not good excuses for failing to act on the matter for more than a year (or for the seven or eight months the Staff was put in charge of the file). They fall within the category of “_temporary indisposition, pressure of work or the vagaries of the post_” which are ordinarily not good reasons in a reinstatement application: see _Ong Leng Hwee v Abdul Aziz bin Omar_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGDC 122</span> at \[20\].

10     Third, the personal circumstances of the Staff are, in any event, matters of limited relevance in this reinstatement application, for the simple reason that the action could (and should) have progressed even without the assistance of the Staff. The position may be different if it was the _Plaintiff_ who was unable to attend to the matter due to personal and/or health issues, because it is understandably difficult for the action to progress without involvement or instructions from him. But to say that the matter was allowed to go dormant for more than a year because “_a staff of the firm_” overlooked the file is not acceptable. In any event, it is the lawyer who has conduct of a matter and not his staff. Whilst a lawyer may rely on his staff to assist him in the conduct of matters he undertakes, he bears ultimate responsibility for it. To paraphrase the well-known expression – the “buck stops” with the lawyer.

11     To be clear, the health and personal issues of the Staff were only broadly and vaguely described in PC’s affidavit, with no documentary support. Had I considered these to be material to my decision I would have given the Plaintiff an opportunity to supplement this aspect of the evidence. However, for the reasons given at \[9\] and \[10\] above, I do not consider it necessary to do so. PC did not in any event seek leave to put in further evidence for this application.

12     Lastly, I am not persuaded by the Plaintiff’s suggestion that the inaction is a result of the WFH arrangement implemented at PC’s law firm “_following the government’s advisory_” during these “_unprecedented times_” and because PC’s “_paramount concern_” had been “_the safety of all_ \[his\] _staffs_”. The causative connection between the two is not clear.

13     Between 27 September 2021 to 24 October 2021, Singapore was in the “Stabilisation Phase” and the government advisory was that WFH should be the default for employees who are _able to work from home_.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) If telecommuting was not possible, then those returning to work are strongly encouraged to conduct weekly Antigen Rapid Tests. Thereafter, Singapore entered into a transition phase with further relaxation of measures. In April 2022, the Tripartite Statement on Flexible Work Arrangements was issued and it encourages employers to permit telecommuting _for tasks that do not need to be done onsite_.[^3] In short, at no material time between the Trigger Date and the Guillotine Date was the Staff or PC _compelled_ to WFH to carry out tasks which _could not_ be performed at home. In fact, all this is quite beside the point because the Staff _could_ have attended to the matter, and PC could have exercised supervision over its conduct working from home, even if it may be more difficult or cumbersome to do so.

14     Much effort has been taken to ensure that legal proceedings can continue to progress during the pandemic. Many proceedings have in fact so progressed through the pandemic, as a testament to these efforts. The fact of the matter is that the Staff simply neglected this suit and PC was unaware until it was too late. This has _nothing_ to do with whether the Staff and PC were working from home or working from the office; it has nothing to do with whether PC was “_following the government’s advisory_”; and it has nothing to do with whether PC had “_the safety of all_ \[his\] _staffs_” at heart.

15     This is not a case where matters were being progressed behind-the-scenes. There were no settlement negotiations on-going. No information or documents were being exchanged. No medical re-examination was being undertaken. No reports were requested or pending. No affidavit(s) was being drafted. No instructions were requested or pending. In fact, given PC’s explanation for the delay, none of that could have happened because the Staff and PC simply overlooked this file. In these circumstances and for the reasons given, I cannot find any basis to excuse or justify the Plaintiff’s inaction after the Trigger Date.

16     Since the three requirements in _Moguntia_ (at \[21\]) are conjunctive, I need not go on to consider the balance of justice: see _Woon Tek Seng and another v V Jayaraman a/l V A Vellasamy and another_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 3 SLR(R) 43</span> at \[14\]; _Kim Seong Mo v Securiforce Sdn Bnd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 297</span> at \[36\]; _Singapore Civil Procedure 2021 vol 1_ (Cavinder Bull gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 2021) at \[21/5/16\].

17     However, if I had to do that and _assuming_ I am satisfied that the Plaintiff’s inaction after the Trigger Date is excusable, I would have been inclined to find that the balance of justice lie in favour of reinstatement, because the Plaintiff’s claim would otherwise be time-barred. In this regard, I do not accept the Defendant’s submission that he would be prejudiced by a reinstatement because the Defendant would lose an accrued limitation defence. If the Plaintiff decides to commence a new claim today, either without trying to reinstate this action or having done so unsuccessfully, the Defendant would be entitled to raise a limitation defence to the new claim. Nothing was “lost” by the Defendant. If this reinstatement application is allowed, then the Defendant simply has no limitation defence: see _Ng Ah Lay_ at \[18\]. Nothing “accrued” to the Defendant. Either way, the Defendant is not prejudiced by having been deprived of an accrued defence.

18     I appreciate that the result of my decision today means that the Plaintiff would not be able to proceed with his claim, even though IJ has already been entered. I also appreciate that Order 21 r 2(6) is ultimately a case management tool and the harsh consequences visited upon a dilatory claimant results from a procedural (and not substantive) default. I appreciate that the Plaintiff would be dismayed. However, given the reasons I have been presented with and the requirements in _Moguntia_, I have little choice but to dismiss the application.

19     In fairness, PC had been upfront about his omissions (and/or that of his Staff) in this application and the difficult situation he found himself in. I am sympathetic to the Plaintiff and, to an extent, the PC. However, cases are not decided based on where my sympathies lie. The risk of hard cases making bad law must be avoided. Accordingly, I dismiss the application.
