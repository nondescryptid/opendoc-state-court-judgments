Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9271/2021/01.\]

22 February 2022

### District Judge Lynette Yap:

## Introduction

1       The accused, Feng Xiaoming, a 34 year-old male People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) national, was tried on a charge of harbouring an illegal immigrant in contravention of the Immigration Act (Cap 133). The immigration offender Dong Yang, a female PRC national, had remained unlawfully in Singapore after the expiry of her special pass on 27 June 2019 until she was arrested on 20 August 2019. It was the prosecution’s position that between 30 July 2019 and 20 August 2019, the accused harboured Dong Yang at block 691 Jurong West Central 1, #XXX, Singapore 640691 (the “Unit”) with reckless disregard as to whether she had acted in contravention of section 15(1) of the Immigration Act and the accused had thereby committed an offence under section 57(1)(d)(ii) punishable under section 57(1)(iv) of the said Act.

2       The accused was unrepresented in the course of the trial. At the end of the trial, after reviewing the evidence and the submissions of parties, the accused was found guilty and was convicted accordingly. After the accused was convicted, he engaged defence counsel to act for him. Having heard both the Prosecution’s submissions on sentence and the Defence’s mitigation plea, I sentenced the accused to 7 months’ imprisonment. As the accused now appeals against both conviction and sentence, I set down the reasons for my decision.

## The prosecution’s case

3       The prosecution’s case consisted of evidence given by five witnesses. A summary of their evidence is set out below.

### Evidence of PW1 Inspector Heng Sui Chun Nelson

4       Inspector Heng Sui Chun Nelson (“Inspector Heng”) from the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (“ICA”) testified that on 20 August 2019, he arrested Dong Yang during a joint operation with the Police. A police officer, under the guise of a customer, had made an appointment with a woman on a website offering sexual services and he was given the address of the Unit. Inspector Heng was one of the arresting officers who entered the Unit with the police officer.

5       Inspector Heng stated that there were three women in the Unit, Dong Yang, one Xie Xiying who was also an illegal immigrant and a third woman who was a valid pass holder. Sex paraphernalia was found, and the women admitted they were offering sexual services in the Unit.

6       When questioned as to who had allowed them to stay in the Unit, Dong Yang and Xie Xiying showed Inspector Heng a photograph of their landlord, who they addressed as “Ming Ge”. Inspector Heng called his colleagues at the headquarters to try to find a match for the photograph. Dong Yang and Xie Xiying were subsequently shown a photograph of the accused from ICA’s records, and they confirmed that the accused was the person who allowed them to stay in the Unit.

### Evidence of PW2, Inspector Teh Meng Li

7       Inspector Teh Meng Li (“Inspector Teh”) from ICA testified that he had conducted a search of the travel movement records for Dong Yang (Exhibit P1) and the screening results of her work pass (Exhibit P2). Dong Yang first arrived in Singapore on 17 April 2019 and she was granted a 14-day visit pass. On 25 April 2019, she was granted a work pass by the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”). On 20 June 2019, her work pass was cancelled, and she was given a special pass by MOM which was valid from 20 June 2019 to 26 June 2019. Upon the expiry of her special pass, Dong Yang remained unlawfully in Singapore from 27 June 2019 until her arrest on 20 August 2019.

8       The mobile phones of the accused and Dong Yang were admitted into evidence (Exhibit P4 and P5 respectively). Inspector Teh exhibited photographs he had taken of images which were on the accused’s and Dong Yang’s mobile phones (Exhibit P6 and P7 respectively). The accused’s WeChat identity as listed in his mobile phone was “花开富贵 W1649683004”. In Dong Yang’s mobile phone, she had saved the same WeChat identity known as “花开富贵W1649683004” and labelled the person as “xjp 房东西部”, which PW4, Mr Ee Soon Huat, an interpreter engaged by Inspector Teh testified was “xjp fang dong xi bu” in Hanyu Pinyin and meant “landlord at west region”.

### Evidence of PW4, Ee Soon Huat

9       PW4, Mr Ee Soon Huat, was engaged by Inspector Teh to translate the photographs Inspector Teh had taken of the accused and Dong Yang’s mobile phones. Mr Ee testified that he had translated the contents of these photographs from Mandarin to English (Exhibit P8).

### Evidence of PW3, Dong Yang

10     On the stand, Dong Yang was asked if she recognised the accused. She testified that the accused was “Ming Ge”, the person who she regarded as her landlord, and who she had seen and interacted with when she was living at the Unit[^1]. Dong Yang also testified she remembered the accused’s voice and it was very similar to the voice she was hearing in court[^2].

11     Dong Yang testified that she had come to Singapore from China to work in a bar. However, her agent, one Song Yong Kang, informed her that the bar was being renovated and she could only start work later. She needed money to pay for her rent and expenses and Song Yong Kang suggested that she could provide “massage services”. She was then living in a condominium in Geylang, but because business was not good at the area she was staying, she asked Song Yong Kang if she could shift to another area to operate and he helped her to look for an alternative location. She paid $120 daily as rent to Song Yong Kang by WeChat transfer[^3] and Song Yong Kang informed her that the accused was her landlord, and she should look for him if she needed anything[^4].

12     Dong Yang testified that she had communicated with the accused via WeChat on matters pertaining to the premises. She had saved his WeChat identity known as “花开富贵 W1649683004” and labelled it “xjp 房东西部”. Dong Yang explained that she prefixed the labels of her contacts in Singapore with “xjp” as it was her short form for the people she knew in Singapore[^5].

13     Dong Yang testified that she had moved into the Unit at the end of July 2019. She had asked the accused where the keys to the Unit were and he had told her it was in the master bedroom she had booked and asked her to look for the keys herself[^6]. When she arrived at the Unit, a woman living in the Unit opened the door for her and she went to the master bedroom. She testified that she met the accused on the 2nd or 3rd day after she arrived at the Unit[^7]. On that occasion, she met the accused at the Unit to collect a Wi-Fi access card from the accused and for the accused to install the Wi-Fi access card for her[^8].

14     Dong Yang stated that apart from this first meeting with the accused at the Unit, she saw him at the Unit on two other occasions[^9]. Dong Yang testified that on one occasion, she had messaged the accused to ask him to repair a choked pipe in the common room beside the kitchen[^10]. Dong Yang further testified that during her stay at the Unit, no one other than the accused came to the Unit to do any repairs[^11].

15     When questioned as to the other meeting, Dong Yang testified that on that occasion, the accused had delivered a Wi-Fi card[^12]. Dong Yang gave further evidence that the accused had visited the unit with a male companion on one of the occasions, and a female companion on another of the occasions[^13].

16     The WeChat records on Dong Yang’s phone captured her messages and chat log records with the accused from 31 July 2019 to 15 August 2019[^14], including:

> (a)     WeChat text messages on 5 August 2019 where Dong Yang addressed the accused as “Mr Landlord”, sent him a photo of 2 keys and complained that the keys to her room and to the main door could not be inserted and asked the accused if they were fake[^15],

> (b)     WeChat text messages on 6 August 2019 where Dong Yang asked the accused to inform their neighbour not to open the neighbour’s door as this caused inconvenience to the shy tenants of the Unit[^16],

> (c)     WeChat text messages on 10 August 2019 where Dong Yang informed the accused that the internet was working now[^17], and

> (d)     WeChat text messages on 15 August 2019 where the accused asked Dong Yang if she was at the Unit and asked her to try to see whether the internet was working[^18],

17     Dong Yang testified that she was also part of a WeChat chat group comprising herself and the two other women who lived in the Unit, the agent Song Yong Kang and the accused[^19]. The WeChat records on Dong Yang’s phone captured the communications on this chat group from the time Dong Yang was added to this chat group on 31 July 2019 and removed from the chat group on 24 August 2019[^20].

18     Dong Yang’s evidence and the WeChat records for this chat group showed that the accused interacted with Dong Yang and the other women in the Unit on several other occasions, including:

> (a)     WeChat text messages on 31 July 2019 where the accused asked the women to open the door for him in a while and that he would be arriving in 5 minutes[^21]. The accused then sent a photo of a Wi-Fi card which had a passcode on it[^22]. This was followed by requests by the women to the accused to act as a lookout to observe whether there were passers-by downstairs since he had just left the Unit[^23]. The accused replied that everything was alright and instructed the women to tell their customers to take alternate routes to the Unit to avoid their neighbours[^24];

> (b)     WeChat text and voice messages on 1 August 2019 where the accused instructed the women how to reduce the noise caused by the metal gate to the Unit[^25];

> (c)     WeChat text messages on 2 August 2019 and 10 August 2019 where the accused informed the women of the password to the Wi-Fi network[^26];

> (d)     WeChat text messages on 4 August 2019 where the accused instructed the women to stop work on a Sunday as their neighbours were at home[^27];

> (e)     WeChat text and voice messages on 10 August 2019 where the accused told one of the women to shift the bed and not open the window, in response to her complaint that the air-conditioning in her room was leaking[^28]; and

> (f)     WeChat text and voice messages on 10 August 2019, 11 August 2019 and 14 August 2019 where the accused told the women how to prevent the air-conditioning from leaking and stated that he would give them a call as to when he would come over to repair it[^29].

19     Dong Yang further stated that the accused knew that she and the other women were offering sexual services on the premises as he would ask them to maintain hygiene on the premises since their rubbish contained condoms[^30].

20     Dong Yang testified that the accused had not ever asked her about her immigration status nor asked to see her passport or work pass[^31].

### Evidence of PW5, Mr Vincent Gay

21     Mr Vincent Gay was the housing agent who, together with another housing agent, co-brokered the tenancy agreement between the owners of the premises and six other PRC nationals. He testified that he did not know the accused.

22     The owners of the premises were not called as witnesses. Dong Yang’s agent, Song Yong Kang was also not called as a witness.

## The Defence’s case

23     At the end of the Prosecution’s case, I found that a prima facie case had been made out and I called on the accused for his defence. The accused elected to testify and also called one witness, his girlfriend, to corroborate his defence.

### Evidence of DW1, the accused

24     The accused had been working in Singapore since 2010. For the first three and a half years in Singapore, he was a welder. Thereafter, he worked in Resorts World Sentosa Jurong East as a housekeeper. He had been staying at block 411, Jurong West St 42, #XXX since 2015 or 2016.

25     The crux of the accused’s defence was that he was not Dong Yang’s landlord. He denied knowing Dong Yang. He also denied communicating with her and the other women via WeChat and asserted that he had “lost” his WeChat account and it had been hacked. He claimed that Dong Yang had identified him as her landlord in order to frame him. He further stated that he had not signed any tenancy agreement for the Unit.

26     During his examination in chief, the accused testified that in 2019, he had gone to the Unit on a total of four occasions. On the first two occasions, he was there for sexual services with a woman and on another two occasions, he was there with his girlfriend who was looking for an apartment to rent[^32]. However, during cross-examination, he changed his mind and denied that he had been to the Unit at all. He also denied that he and his girlfriend had gone to the Unit when they were looking for an apartment to rent[^33].

### Evidence of DW2, Du Rong

27     Despite the accused’s evidence in cross-examination that he had not gone with his girlfriend to view the Unit, he called her as his witness. She testified that she had gone with him to look for an apartment to rent but she could not remember if she had been to the Unit.

## Evaluation and Findings

28     There was no dispute that Dong Yang was an overstayer. There was also no dispute that the accused’s and Dong Yang’s mobile phones had been properly admitted into evidence and that the translation of the photographs Inspector Teh had taken of the accused and Dong Yang’s mobile phones were accurate. This case turned upon a question of fact, as to whether the accused was the person who had provided Dong Yang shelter and habitation at the Unit.

### Whether the accused was Dong Yang’s landlord

29     Dong Yang recognised and identified the accused as “Ming Ge”, the person she regarded as her landlord. He was in charge of the Unit when she was residing there. She met and interacted with him on a few occasions at the Unit and corresponded with him over WeChat text and voice messages over matters pertaining to the Unit.

30     Dong Yang’s testimony was supported by the evidence found in the WeChat accounts on both Dong Yang and the accused’s mobile phones. The accused stated that his mobile phone was seized on 26 August 2019, (6 days after Dong Yang’s arrest) when he was asked to present himself at ICA[^34]. The WeChat account on the accused’s mobile phone showed that his WeChat identity was “花开富贵 W1649683004”, which matched the WeChat identity of the person that Dong Yang had been communicating with, and had labelled as her landlord on her mobile phone.

31     The accused did not deny that this was his WeChat identity[^35] but contended that he was not the person who communicated with Dong Yang as he had “lost” his WeChat identity when his account was hacked in 2018 or 2019, resulting in the loss of about 3000 RMB (amounting to about S$600) from his account[^36]. However, he was unable to produce any evidence to substantiate his bare assertion that his WeChat identity had been “lost” and offered no reasonable explanation as to why the allegedly compromised WeChat identity was still on his mobile phone.

32     The accused asserted that the WeChat messages found on Dong Yang’s mobile phone were not found on his phone and that the WeChat profile pictures were different. However, messages can be deleted, and profile pictures can be changed, as the accused himself admitted[^37]. The fact is that the relevant WeChat text and voice messages were exchanged, since they were clearly on record in Dong Yang’s mobile phone.

33     The accused also admitted during cross-examination that the WeChat voice messages in Dong Yang’s mobile phone which were played in court pertaining to matters concerning the Unit sounded like him[^38].

34     The accused’s contradictory testimony as to whether he had been to the Unit also revealed a lack of credibility. He initially asserted that he had been to the Unit on four occasions in 2019. The first two occasions were to engage sexual services from a lady. On another two occasions, he went with his girlfriend to view the premises for his girlfriend to rent. When it appeared illogical that he would want his girlfriend to live in premises where he knew a brothel was operating, he contradicted himself and insisted he had never been to the Unit after all[^39].

35     The accused also asserted that Dong Yang had framed him. He attempted to explain that he had previously gone to the Unit for sexual services with an unidentified lady, but it was an unpleasant experience as the lady was not as attractive as the photograph on the website. The accused alleged that as a result of this unpleasant experience, the lady had given his photograph to Dong Yang to frame him[^40].

36     However, the accused’s evidence was that he had gone to see the same lady twice for sexual services. When asked why he had gone to the same lady a second time if his experience had been unpleasant, he contradicted himself by asserting that his first experience was not unpleasant after all and that her services were good enough to make him return. He eventually admitted during cross-examination that as the experience was overall a good one, there was no reason for the lady to frame him[^41]. The accused offered no other satisfactory evidence as to why Dong Yang would frame him.

37     On a totality of the evidence, I was satisfied that Dong Yang had properly identified the accused as “Ming Ge”, the person who she regarded as her landlord of the Unit. Her evidence was clear, consistent and unequivocal that she recognised the accused and had interacted with the accused on a number of occasions at the Unit. On the other hand, the accused’s evidence was unconvincing, self-serving and contradictory. His attempts to explain why his WeChat identity matched the WeChat identity of the person that Dong Yang had been communicating with were totally inadequate. Dong Yang’s identification of the accused in court, her recognition of the accused’s voice, the WeChat identity listed on the accused’s mobile phone and the accused’s admission of the similarity of his voice with the voice messages in the WeChat recordings showed that the accused was “Ming Ge”.

### Whether the accused was a “harbourer”

38     Section 57(1)(d)(ii) of the Immigration Act states that any person who harbours a person with reckless disregard as to whether he has acted in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the regulations shall be guilty of an offence. Section 2 of the Immigration Act defines the word “harbour” as “to give food or shelter and includes the act of assisting a person in any way to evade apprehension”. In _Lee Boon Leng Joseph v PP_ \[1997\] 1 SLR 445 at \[41\], the court defined “shelter” as the provision of some form of habitation to the immigration offender.

39     I was satisfied that the accused had given Dong Yang shelter and he was in charge of the matters pertaining to Dong Yang’s accommodation. He had told her where she could find the keys to the Unit, and provided her with the Wi-Fi card and password for internet connectivity. He had also given instructions on maintaining the hygiene of the Unit and instructed Dong Yang and the other women not to disturb the neighbours. The accused was the only one who conducted repairs at the Unit, and he dealt with various maintenance issues at the Unit, including the noise that the metal gate made, choked or leaking pipes and the air-conditioning.

40     It was the accused’s position that he had not entered into any tenancy agreement with the owner of the premises. However, it is irrelevant that the accused had not signed a tenancy agreement with the owner of the premises. In _Usha Elizabeth v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 1 SLR(R) 338</span>, the court stated at \[20\] that “any positive act of giving shelter in the form of providing habitation to an immigration offender by any person whosoever falls squarely within the clear statutory definition of the word “harbour”, and there is nothing in that definition which restricts the classes of persons intended to be caught by it to owners, landlords and tenants…”

41     For completeness, I will add that while Dong Yang testified that she paid rent of $120 daily to the agent Song Yong Kang and not the accused, this did not detract from the fact that the accused did provide shelter and habitation to Dong Yang.

42     Section 57(7) of the Immigration Act provides that where it is proved that the accused has given shelter to an immigration offender, it shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, that the defendant has harboured him with reckless disregard as to whether he is an immigration offender. This can only be rebutted if the accused carried out any two of the acts specified in section 57(7d) of the Immigration Act.

43     As the accused asserted that he did not know Dong Yang and had not met her before, it was not his defence that he had conducted the necessary checks on her immigration status. In any event, Dong Yang’s evidence was that the accused had not ever asked her about her immigration status and had not asked to see her passport or work permit.

### The finding of guilt

44     On a careful assessment of the evidence before the court, I was satisfied that the prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and I convicted the accused accordingly.

## Sentencing Considerations

45     For an offence under section 57(1)(d)(ii) of the Immigration Act, punishable under section 57(1)(iv) of the said Act, the prescribed punishment is a term of imprisonment of not less than 6 months and not more than 2 years, and the offender shall also be liable to a fine not exceeding $6,000.

46     The accused is a first offender.

### Prosecution’s submissions on sentence and the mitigation plea

47     The mandatory minimum sentence for this offence is 6 months’ imprisonment. The prosecution submitted that the court should impose a sentence of at least 8 months’ imprisonment on the accused. The prosecution referred to _PP v Zhang Yinghui_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 57</span> (“_Zhang Yinghui_”), which in turn cited two cases involving first offenders who had claimed trial to section 57(1)(d)(ii) of the Immigration Act charges, and who were sentenced to 8 months’ imprisonment (_PP v Mahfud bin Ahmed_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] SGDC 133</span> (“_Mahfud_”) and 10 months’ imprisonment (_PP v Eng Yong Huat_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGDC 213</span>) respectively.

48     The prosecution submitted that the court should consider the “Checklist of factors affecting sentence”, which was set out in page 1508 of the “Practitioners’ Library: Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts”, Third Edition Vol. II, where the relevant factors highlighted included:

> (a)     Aggravating factors like

>> (i)       Complete failure to ascertain immigration status of person harboured,

>> (ii)       Harbouring over a prolonged period, and

>> (iii)       Profit motive.

> (b)     Mitigating factors like

>> (i)       Timely plea of guilt, and

>> (ii)       Checks conducted on the immigration status but still falling short of required standard of due diligence.

49     The prosecution submitted that the mandatory minimum of 6 months’ imprisonment was imposed on offenders who pleaded guilty and demonstrated remorse, but this sentencing discount would not be extended to the accused as he had claimed trial. The prosecution submitted that an aggravating factor in the present case was that the accused completely failed to ascertain the immigration status of Dong Yang. The prosecution argued that it was reasonable to infer that the accused had profited monetarily from harbouring Dong Yang as he had worked with Song Yong Kang to manage the brothel out of the HDB flat. The prosecution further argued that the accused’s lack of remorse was evident from the fact that he refused to have the stood down charge for harbouring Xie Xiying taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.

50     In response, in mitigation, the defence counsel highlighted the personal circumstances of the accused and the fact that the accused had only harboured Dong Yang for a period of 22 days. The accused’s counsel also stated that the accused had been given a stern warning by the Police and the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority for operating a brothel and for harbouring Xie Xiying at the Unit respectively. The defence counsel submitted that the court should impose the mandatory minimum sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment

### Decision on sentence

51     As regards to accused’s personal circumstances, these were certainly not exceptional and did not provide any basis for a reduction in his sentence.

52     A consideration of the precedents show that the mandatory minimum of 6 months’ imprisonment was imposed for offenders who pleaded guilty. For the cases which proceeded to trial, I note that in _Mahfud_, the court imposed a sentence of 8 months’ imprisonment where the period of harbouring was 20 days and the immigration offender had allowed another 11 other illegal immigrants to stay in the same flat. In _Eng Yong Huat_, the period of harbouring was 3 months, and the court imposed a sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment. In _Zhang Yinghui_, the period of harbouring was 1 month and 2 weeks and the court imposed a sentence of 7 months’ imprisonment. The court considered that there was an obvious profit motive involved in the accused’s harbouring of the immigration offender and while the accused had failed to carry out the due diligence checks, he had asked the immigration offender for his original work permit (although he allowed the immigration offender to stay even when this document was not produced), and that while delayed, the accused did ultimately get the immigration offender to leave the unit thus preventing the period of harbouring from being prolonged.

53     I note that there was an aggravating factor in the present case as the accused had completely failed to ascertain the immigration status of Dong Yang. However, with regards to the prosecution’s arguments that it could be reasonably inferred that the accused profited monetarily from harbouring Dong Yang, while this was possible, no evidence of this was actually adduced in the course of the trial, nor was the matter put to the accused.

54     The accused showed a lack of remorse by claiming trial and not pleading guilty. While the period that he harboured Dong Yang was relatively short at 22 days, this was curtailed by Dong Yang’s arrest rather than any action taken by the accused. The harbouring of immigration offenders is a serious offence and poses a serious security risk. The accused did not perform any due diligence checks whatsoever and went further by assisting the women to evade detection for their vice activities. Accordingly, it is not appropriate to merely impose the mandatory minimum of 6 months’ imprisonment. Taking into account that the accused is a first offender, I am of the view that a sentence of 7 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate and proportional considering the circumstances of the case.

55     For completeness, I also address the prosecution’s argument that the accused’s lack of remorse was evident from the fact that he refused to have the stood down charge for harbouring Xie Xiying taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. I was not convinced that this was an aggravating sentencing factor. The accused is entitled to have his day in court in regard to the charge of harbouring Xie Xiying, and has not been found guilty of that charge. The prosecution did not dispute the accused’s assertion that he had already been issued with a stern warning for the charge of harbouring Xie Xiying. Furthermore, at the conclusion of proceedings before me, the prosecution applied to have the charge of harbouring Xie Xiying withdrawn. I accordingly granted a discharge amounting to an acquittal for that charge. It would be wholly inappropriate to regard an accused person’s refusal to have a charge taken into consideration, as an aggravating factor for sentencing in respect of a different charge.

56     The accused, being dissatisfied, has filed an appeal against his conviction and sentence. In the interim, the sentence of imprisonment has been stayed and the accused is on bail pending the hearing of the appeal.
