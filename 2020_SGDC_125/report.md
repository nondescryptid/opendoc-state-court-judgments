Tort – Negligence

Insurance – Liability insurance

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in DCA 8/2020.\]

19 May 2020

### District Judge Lim Wee Ming:

## Introduction

1       The plaintiff’s claim arises from the explosion of a gas canister at the restaurant of the first defendant, Chong Qing (Origin) Steamboat (Pte) Ltd (“Chong Qing”). The gas canister was supplied by the second defendant, Swee Huat Heng Engineering Pte Ltd (“Swee Huat”). I allowed the plaintiff’s claim against Chong Qing, but dismissed the plaintiff’s claim against Swee Huat.

2       I also allowed Chong Qing’s third party claim against its insurer, Liberty Insurance Pte Ltd (“Liberty Insurance”), but dismissed Chong Qing’s third party claim against Swee Huat. Liberty Insurance has appealed against my decision. None of the other parties have appealed.

## Facts

3       On 4 April 2015 at about 3:45 am, the plaintiff and her friend were having a meal at Chong Qing’s steamboat restaurant at Beach Road, when the gas canister in the portable gas stove that they were using to cook food exploded.

4       The plaintiff suffered burns on her face and upper limbs as a result of the explosion. While she was in hospital, the plaintiff was interviewed by a journalist from Lianhe Wanbao. The plaintiff stated in the interview that she had seen Chong Qing’s staff insert a piece of paper into the switch of the stove, to prevent the stove from turning off.

5       The plaintiff commenced legal proceedings against Chong Qing for negligence. Chong Qing claimed in its defence that the accident was caused by Swee Huat, the supplier of the stove and gas canister and commenced third party proceedings against Swee Huat. Thereafter, the plaintiff amended her statement of claim to include an alternative claim against Swee Huat.

6       Chong Qing had a Cafecare Insurance Policy (“the Policy”) with Liberty Insurance, where Liberty Insurance undertook to indemnify Chong Qing against:

> (a)     all sums which Chong Qing should become legally liable to pay compensation in respect of accidental bodily injury happening in connection with Chong Qing’s business,

> (b)     all costs and expenses recoverable from Chong Qing by any claimant, and

> (c)     all costs and expenses incurred with Liberty Insurance’s written consent.[^1]

7       Liberty Insurance repudiated liability under the Policy. Chong Qing commenced third party proceedings against Liberty Insurance. Liberty Insurance’s defence is that Chong Qing had breached the Policy’s General Conditions, by failing to:

> (a)     take reasonable precautions in its supervision of its employees to prevent accidents,

> (b)     take reasonable precautions to comply with statutory obligations to prevent accidents, by not having a valid storage license for liquefied petroleum gas (“LPG”) and butane, and

> (c)     comply with Liberty Insurance’s requirements by not providing documentation that Chong Qing had been fined $300 after the accident, for not having the aforesaid storage licence.

8       The parties do not dispute that the test of what amounts to reasonable precautions is whether the insured had been reckless, with actual knowledge that a danger exists. Mere negligence would not suffice, as the commercial purpose of a liability policy is for the insurer to indemnify the insured, for claims in negligence against the insured.

## Issues

9       The key issues at the trial, were as follows:

> (a)     Claims against Chong Qing and Swee Huat: whether the explosion was caused by Chong Qing, Swee Huat or the plaintiff.

> (b)     Claim against Liberty Insurance:

>> (i)       whether Chong Qing was reckless in its supervision of its employees,

>> (ii)       whether Chong Qing was reckless in not having a valid storage license for LPG and butane, and

>> (iii)       whether Chong Qing failed to comply with Liberty Insurance’s requirements.

## Claims against Chong Qing and Swee Huat

10     I will first deal with the claims against Chong Qing and Swee Huat. There are three versions put forward by the parties as to how the accident occurred, as follows:

> (a)     The plaintiff claims that the accident was caused by Chong Qing’s waitress inserting a wad of tissue in the switch of the stove, to prevent it from tripping.[^2]

> (b)     Chong Qing’s defence is that the accident was caused by the plaintiff re-lighting the stove herself without seeking the assistance of Chong Qing’s staff or by the plaintiff shifting the gas canister or stove.[^3]

> (c)     The plaintiff and Chong Qing further claim in the alternative that the accident was caused by Swee Huat, in supplying the stove and gas canister involved in the explosion. The plaintiff’s claim against Swee Huat is in negligence.[^4] Chong Qing’s claim against Swee Huat is in breach of contract and negligence.[^5]

11     The issue to be determined is which of these three versions, should be accepted by the Court.

12     In relation to Chong Qing’s defence that the accident was caused by the plaintiff re-lighting the stove herself or shifting the gas canister or stove, Chong Qing has not specified how any of these actions could have led to the explosion. Furthermore, although the evidence of Zuo Ming Yue, Chong Qing’s waitress who served the plaintiff, was that she saw the plaintiff fiddling with the lever and the knob of the stove[^6], there was no evidence that the plaintiff had used the stove in the manner described by Chong Qing in its defence. Although Zuo Ming Yue alleged that the plaintiff had tilted the cooking pot (rather than the stove), there is no evidence as to how this might have caused the gas canister to explode.

13     In relation to the allegation that Swee Huat had been in breach of contract or negligent in its supply of the stove and gas canister, there is no evidence to support this allegation. The evidence of Swee Huat’s general manager, Tan Soo Hwang, was that the stove and canister had been tested under the Singapore Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Registration Scheme and that Certificates of Conformity had been issued, certifying that the canister and the stove complied with the scheme.[^7] There is no evidence from either the plaintiff or Chong Qing to refute this.

14     Furthermore, after the incident, SPRING Singapore informed Swee Huat that it would be randomly collecting samples of canisters and stoves supplied by Swee Huat to other restaurants. The samples collected complied with the required specification.[^8] Again, there is no evidence from the plaintiff or Chong Qing to refute this.

15     The plaintiff gave evidence, that the switch on the stove repeatedly tripped and Chong Qing’s waitress then proceeded to take some tissue and rolled it up into a wad which the waitress then inserted into the switch compartment, presumably to prevent it from tripping again.[^9] This switch is the safety lever of the stove. The instruction manual for the stove states that the safety lever would activate if there was pressure building up in the gas canister which would eject the gas canister, shutting off the gas supply.[^10] Tan Soo Hwang gave evidence that stuffing paper into the switch would prevent the safety lever from activating and result in the explosion of the gas canister.[^11]

16     In response to the plaintiff’s allegations against Chong Qing, Zuo Ming Yue, Chong Qing’s waitress, claimed that she did not insert any paper in the stove and was instructed by Chong Qing not to do so.[^12]

17     I find the evidence of the plaintiff that Chong Qing’s waitress had inserted a wad of tissue into the switch, more credible in light of the contemporaneous news report that was published in AsiaOne on 7 April 2015, soon after the accident, that contained an interview with the plaintiff that is consistent with the plaintiff’s account. In this news report, it was stated that the plaintiff told Lianhe Wanbao that “the portable stove she was using kept emitting clicking noises and turning off, and a waiter had fixed the problem by inserting a piece of paper to prevent the stove from automatically turning off”.[^13] The plaintiff’s evidence was that she had been interviewed by a journalist from Lianhe Wanbao, the day after her operation.[^14] The account in the news report of the paper being inserted to prevent the stove from automatically turning off, is generally consistent with the plaintiff’s account of the incident.

18     Although there is some discrepancy, in that the news report described that paper was used, rather than tissue and the news report did not refer to the tissue being inserted into the switch, the discrepancy between the news report and the plaintiff’s evidence is not so great, as to cause the plaintiff’s account of the incident to be unbelievable. I am of the view that the plaintiff’s description of what led to the incident is largely consistent. In the premises, I accept the plaintiff’s account that Chong Qing’s employee had inserted a wad of tissue into the switch of the stove.

19     Chong Qing argued that the plaintiff has not pleaded that Chong Qing’s employee had inserted a wad of tissue into the switch of the stove.[^15] However, I note that the plaintiff has pleaded that Chong Qing and/or its employees had “\[Exposed\] the Plaintiff to a risk of damage or injury of which they knew or ought to have known”.[^16] Chong Qing ought to have known that the insertion of a wad of tissue in the switch would expose the plaintiff to the risk of injury and the act of its employee of inserting the wad of tissue into the switch did in fact expose the plaintiff to the risk of injury. The aforesaid pleading is sufficiently wide to cover the employee of Chong Qing’s insertion of a wad of tissue into the switch of the stove.

20     In the premises, I decided in favour of the plaintiff’s claim against Chong Qing and dismissed the claims by the plaintiff and Chong Qing against Swee Huat.

## Claim against Liberty Insurance

21     As for Chong Qing’s insurance claim against Liberty Insurance, Liberty Insurance is relying on:

> (a)     section 3 read with sub-section (a) of the Policy’s General Conditions which provides that Chong Qing is “to take all reasonable precautions to prevent loss, damage or accidents including … a) selection and supervision of employees”,

> (b)     section 3 read with sub-section (c) of the Policy’s General Conditions which provides that Chong Qing is “to take all reasonable precautions to prevent loss, damage or accidents including … c) compliance with all statutory obligations”, and

> (c)     section 12(e) of the Policy’s General Conditions which provides that if Chong Qing “shall not comply with our requirements or shall hinder or obstruct us in the exercise of our powers hereunder all benefit under this Policy shall be forfeited”.

22     Liberty Insurance’s position is that:

> (a)     Chong Qing had breached section 3 read with sub-section (a) by:

>> (i)       failing to ensure that its employees handle the gas canister and stove in accordance with the safety instruction manual,

>> (ii)       failing to deploy employees who are trained in the safe operating procedure pertaining to the gas canister and stove,

>> (iii)       failing to ensure a safe operating procedure for its employees to adhere to when handling the gas canister and stove, and

>> (iv)       failing to adequately supervise its employees in the safe and proper handling of the gas canister and stove.

> (b)     Chong Qing had breached section 3 read with sub-section (c) by storing liquefied petroleum gas (“LPG”) and butane without a valid storage license, in violation of section 35 of the Fire Safety Act (Cap 109A, 2000 Rev Ed) read with its applicable rules and regulations, and was fined $300 by the Singapore Civil Defence Force (“SCDF”). This was a composition fine, that was imposed by the SCDF after the accident.[^17]

> (c)     Chong Qing had breached section 12(e) by failing to provide documentation of the fine and instead informed Liberty Insurance that it was only given a verbal warning by SCDF.

### Supervision of employees

23     Liberty Insurance submitted that the safety precautions of Chong Qing were lacklustre to the point of recklessness and that Chong Qing was reckless in:

> (a)     failing to ensure its employees were properly trained,

> (b)     failing to ensure that its employees were well-versed in the safety instruction manual and educated on the cautionary warning signs of the cooker, and

> (c)     failing to identify potential fire safety hazards.[^18]

24     Liberty Insurance pleaded that Chong Qing had breached section 3 read with sub-section (a) of the General Conditions, which provides that _“_\[Chong Qing\] to take all reasonable precautions to prevent loss, damage or accidents including … (a) selection and supervision of employees”.[^19]

25     In _Fraser v BN Furman (Productions) Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1967\] 1 WLR 898</span> (“_Fraser v Furman_”) (at 905-906), Diplock LJ held that reasonable precautions, means:

> … reasonable as between the insured and the insurer having regard to the commercial purpose of the contract, which is inter alia to indemnify the insured against liability for his (the insured’s) personal negligence. … What, in my view, is “reasonable” as between the insured and the insurer, without being repugnant to the commercial object of the contract, is that the insured should not deliberately court a danger, the existence of which he recognises, by refraining from taking any measure to avert it. … _it is not enough that \[the insured’s\] omission to take any particular precautions to avoid accidents should be negligent; it must be at least reckless, that is to say, made with actual recognition by the insured himself that a danger exists, and not caring whether or not it is averted_.

> \[emphasis added\]

26     It is clear from the above, that mere negligence on the part of the insured is not sufficient to show that the insured had failed to act with reasonable precaution. Recklessness is required and the bar is set high, such that there must be “actual recognition by the insured himself that a danger exists, and not caring whether or not it is averted”. _Fraser v Furman_ has been followed by our Court of Appeal in _Lim Chin Yok Co Ltd v Malayan Insurance Co Inc_ \[1974-1976\] SLR (R) 265. The parties do not dispute that the test in _Fraser v Furman_ applies.

27     In _Fraser v Furman_, the defendant’s welding machine had two buttons to be pressed with both hands for its operation. This was a safety feature to prevent the operator’s hands from being caught in the machine. The two buttons were removed by the defendant’s manager with the knowledge of its managing director and instead, a table was placed between the machine and the operator, so that the operator would be further from the machine. The removal of the two buttons, caused the plaintiff who was operating the machine, to be injured when the machine came down on her hand. The court decided the defendant was negligent, but found nothing to show that the alteration of the machine was done recklessly, with actual recognition of the danger involved (at 907).

28     In the present case, I am of the view that the negligence of Chong Qing’s waitress in inserting a wad of tissue into the safety lever of the stove did not amount to the actual recognition by Chong Qing itself that a danger exists, not caring whether or not it is averted. There is no evidence that the insertion of the wad of tissue into the safety switch by Chong Qing’s waitress, was a systemic practice authorised or condoned by Chong Qing, that might show such actual recognition by Chong Qing itself. The evidence from the plaintiff is that Chong Qing’s waitress had inserted the wad of tissue into the switch, but there is no evidence that this had occurred before, that might show that this was a systemic practice that must have been known to Chong Qing itself.

29     In the premises, Liberty Insurance has failed to prove that Chong Qing was reckless in its supervision of its employees. Accordingly, Chong Qing is not in breach of section 3 read with sub-section (a) of the General Conditions of the Policy.

### Compliance with statutory obligations

30     Section 3 read with sub-section (c) of the Policy’s General Conditions provides that Chong Qing is “to take all reasonable precautions to prevent loss, damage or accidents including … c) compliance with all statutory obligations”.

31     For Liberty Insurance to succeed in relying on section 3 read with sub-section (c), it would have to show:

> (a)     there was a breach of a statutory obligation, and

> (b)     in doing so, it had failed to take reasonable precautions to prevent loss, damage or accidents_._

32     It would not suffice for Liberty Insurance to show a breach of a statutory obligation that had no co-relation to a failure to take reasonable precautions to prevent loss, damage or accidents.

33     As explained earlier, the test set out in _Fraser v Furman_ as to what amounts to a failure to take reasonable precautions goes beyond mere negligence. Recklessness is required, which requires the omission to be “made with actual recognition by the insured himself that a danger exists, and not caring whether or not it is averted”.

34     Liberty Insurance takes the position that Chong Qing acted in violation of section 35 of the Fire Safety Act in storing LPG and butane without a license. Section 35 provides:

> No person shall store or keep, or cause to be stored or kept, any class of petroleum or any flammable material except –

>> (a)    in or on licensed premises;

>> (b)    in such quantities and in such manner and in accordance with requirements prescribed in relation to such petroleum or flammable material; and

>> (c)    under the authority of and in accordance with the provisions of a storage licence from the Commissioner and every condition specified therein.

35     In the present case, it would appear that the violation was not so much in the storing of LPG and butane per se, but in not having a valid storage license for doing so. This is evident from the license being subsequently issued and backdated by SCDF, upon the application of Chong Qing.[^20] The license was issued by SCDF on 11 August 2015 and it is stated in the license that it is for the period 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2016, which covers the date of the accident on 4 April 2015.

36     The subsequent issuance and backdating of the license by SCDF would point to Chong Qing having satisfied the necessary requirements for the license, not only at the time it was issued but from the commencement of the period of the license on 1 July 2014. No evidence has been adduced by Liberty Insurance that Chong Qing could not have obtained the license earlier, because of any reasonable precautions that Chong Qing had failed to take, to prevent loss, damage or accidents.

37     The present case is very different from the case of _Grace Electrical Engineering Pte Ltd v EQ Insurance Co Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 233</span> (“_Grace Electrical_”), relied on by Liberty Insurance. In that case, there was a claim against the insured arising from a fire at its factory and the insured sought an indemnity from its insurer. Prior to the fire, the insured had been repeatedly fined by the SCDF for housing its workers in its factory, in breach of the Fire Safety Act, with the second fine being just a few months before the fire (at \[31(99)\]). The High Court applied (at \[34\]), the test in _Fraser v Furman_, but found that the insured was reckless on the facts of that case.

38     Key differences between our present case and _Grace Electrical_ are as follows:

> (a)     In _Grace Electrical_, the Court found that the insured was aware that it was housing its workers in the factory contrary to section 30(1) of the Fire Safety Act and in doing so had compromised fire safety measures (at \[36\]). In the present case, there is no evidence that Chong Qing knew that it was required to obtain a license, before it was notified after the accident that it had committed an offence in not having a license.

> (b)     The insured in _Grace Electrical_ was a repeat offender with a history of non-compliance with the relevant provisions of the Fire Safety Act, having been repeatedly fined for the use of its factory space to house its workers, prior to the fire (at \[31\], \[34\]). The insured in that case was even required by SCDF to stop using the factory as workers’ quarters, but the contravention continued (at \[31(102)\]). In contrast, there is no evidence that Chong Qing had previously been charged or fined for the offence of not having a license to store LPG and butane.

> (c)     Counsel for the insured in _Grace Electrical_, admitted that the insured had “no intention of complying with the law” (at \[38\]). This again is very different from the present case, where Chong Qing subsequently obtained a license from SCDF, after it became aware that its omission to do so, was an offence.

39     Liberty Insurance has argued that Chong Qing was aware that a valid license from SCDF was required.[^21] Liberty Insurance referred to the following extract from the cross-examination of Foo Shuh Tian (“Foo”), Chong Qing’s manager:

> Q:    So this license was applied by you shortly before 11th August 2015. Would I be right to say that?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    Okay. And if you applied for this license, it actually meant that you needed – Chong Qing Steamboat needed the license, in order not to be in breach of the Fire Safety Regulations, correct?

> A:    Yes.[^22]

> …

> Q:    Let me repeat again Mr Foo, you are aware that Chong Qing needed this fire safety license from the SCDF, in order not to be in breach of any Fire Safety Regulations, correct?

> A:    Yes.[^23]

40     It is clear from the reference to the application for the license shortly before 11August 2015, that Foo meant that he was aware at the time he applied for the license, rather than at the time the offence was committed. This is a very different case from _Grace Electrical_, where the insured was a repeat offender and was aware that the housing of workers in the factory was an offence, at the time the insured repeated the offence.

41     In the premises, Liberty Insurance has failed to prove that Chong Qing was reckless in its omission to obtain a license. Accordingly, Chong Qing’s omission to obtain such a license, did not cause Chong Qing to be in breach of section 3 read with sub-section (c) of the General Conditions of the Policy.

### Compliance with requirements

42     Section 12(e) of the Policy’s General Conditions provides that if Chong Qing “shall not comply with our requirements or shall hinder or obstruct us in the exercise of our powers hereunder all benefit under this Policy shall be forfeited”.[^24]

43     Liberty Insurance has pleaded that Chong Qing had breached section 12(e), by failing to provide documentation to Liberty Insurance of the $300 fine for not holding a valid license to store LPG and butane.[^25] Chong Qing was notified of the fine, by way of a Notice of Fire Safety Offence[^26] dated 8 April 2015, that was issued to Chong Qing after the accident.

44     Chong Qing had at a meeting on 9 June 2015, informed the loss adjuster for Liberty Insurance, Crawford & Company International Pte Ltd (“Crawford”), that a fine had been imposed by SCDF. In an email dated 11 June 2015 from Crawford to Chong Qing, Crawford referred to this meeting and requested for the letter regarding the fine.[^27] In an email dated 17 June 2015, Chong Qing replied:

> I mistakenly thought that SCDF would give me a letter with regards to the fine imposed but I realised that SCDF only advised me verbally that if I want to store more than the maximum amount of 250 kg gas, I would have to submit an application and a fee in order to do so. SCDF did not actually give me an official letter.

> If there is still a need for the official letter to assist in your investigation, you may contact SCDF or my gas supplier Union Energy Corporation Pte Ltd personally to obtain it.[^28]

45     Liberty Insurance has pleaded that the above email from Chong Qing meant that Chong Qing had informed Crawford that it was only given a verbal warning.[^29] I am not persuaded that Chong Qing’s email goes as far as that. Although the email states that “SCDF did not actually give me an official letter”, the email did inform Crawford to obtain the official letter from SCDF.

46     In _Diab v Regent Insurance Co Ltd_ \[2007\] 1WLR 797, the Privy Council decided against the insured who had failed for nine years to provide particulars of the stock destroyed in a fire. However, it made the following observation at \[17\], which is pertinent to our case:

> It is now some nine years since the fire and Regent have never been supplied with particulars of the stock in 15 Queen Street that was destroyed by the fire or with any estimate of the value at the time of the fire of the property destroyed. This failure means that Regent were deprived of the opportunity to investigate or query any such particulars and, given the nine year lapse of time, this failure could not now be satisfactorily remedied. The case comes before the Board, therefore, on the footing that the condition 11 condition precedent has not been and cannot now be fulfilled. But their Lordships must not be taken to be assenting to the proposition that Mr Diab’s failure to deliver a written claim and the requisite particulars within the 15-day period specified in condition 11 would necessarily in all circumstances have barred his claim.

47     It is clear from the above extract, that the Privy Council was concerned with the delay of nine years, which prevented the particulars sought from being obtained. In contrast, Chong Qing did inform Crawford on 17 June 2015 that it could obtain the official letter from SCDF. From Crawford’s letter dated 8 July 2015 to Chong Qing, stating that Crawford “have now seen a copy of the original letter from SCDF”[^30], it would appear that Crawford did obtain the letter from SCDF, about three weeks after it was informed by Chong Qing that it could do so. In the premises, I am of the view that Liberty Insurance has not established that Chong Qing has failed to comply with section 12(e).

48     In any event, Liberty Insurance’s reliance on section 12(e), follows from its position that Chong Qing was in breach of section 3 read with sub-section (c), in not holding a valid license to store LPG and butane. However, in view of my finding that Chong Qing was not in breach of section 3 read with sub-section (c), Chong Qing’s failure to provide Liberty Insurance with the notice of its aforesaid violation, did not amount to a non-compliance with Liberty Insurance’s requirements or a hindrance or obstruction of its powers under the Policy, arising from a breach of section 3 of the General Conditions.

49     In the premises, I found in favour of Chong Qing, in its claim against Liberty Insurance.

## Conclusion

50     In conclusion, the plaintiff has succeeded in her claim against Chong Qing and Chong Qing has succeeded in its claim against Liberty Insurance. The following orders were made:

> (a)     interlocutory judgment was entered for the plaintiff against Chong Qing with damages to be assessed, interest and costs reserved,

> (b)     the plaintiff’s claim against Swee Huat was dismissed,

> (c)     Liberty Insurance is to indemnify Chong Qing for all sums (including damages, interests and legal costs) that Chong Qing is found liable to pay to the plaintiff after the assessment of damages,

> (d)     Liberty Insurance is to indemnify Chong Qing for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Chong Qing to defend this action, and

> (e)     Chong Qing’s claim against Swee Huat was dismissed.

51     I further ordered that:

> (a)     Chong Qing pay:

>> (i)       Swee Huat’s costs in relation to the plaintiff’s claim against Swee Huat, and

>> (ii)       Swee Huat’s costs in relation to Chong Qing’s claim against Swee Huat.

> (b)     Liberty Insurance pay the cost of Chong Qing’s claim against Liberty Insurance.
