4       Two other charges (DAC 925965-2016 and DAC 925966-2016) which related to the alleged bribery of another employee of Mustafa were stood down.

5       The accused has filed an appeal against conviction and sentence. He has been released on bail pending appeal.

## BACKGROUND FACTS

6       The accused’s family was in the textile business. He joined the family business after graduation and assisted his uncles Yak Thye Peng and Yak Tiong Liew in the family companies, Swee Wan Trading Pte Ltd (“SWT”) and Swee Wan Enterprise Pte Ltd (“SWE”). SHM and SWA (the companies referred to in the charges) were incorporated later and at the relevant times stated in the charges, business was conducted with Mustafa through these companies. The accused was the driving force behind the business of all the companies.

7       SWE’s main business was to buy and resell cloth. This was a sunset industry. When the accused joined the family business, his uncle Yak Thye Peng asked him to look for new growth areas such as selling ready-made apparel to customers.

8       The accused got his first break with Mustafa around 2001. He had gone there on a cold call with his brother Yak Eng Siong. Mustaq Ahmad (“Mustaq”), the boss of Mustafa agreed to purchase their fabric to make suits. Later that year, Mustafa also agreed to purchase ready-made trousers.[^2]

9       In 2002, the accused approached Mustafa to sell them ready made shirts. Mustaq introduced the accused to Hidaya, who was also known as “uncle” or “Abdullah”. Hidaya was a long-standing employee of Mustafa. He had worked there for around 40 years and was in charge of the shirts department. His duties included purchasing shirts. He was a hard task-master who drove a hard bargain. He decided on the quantity, the material and price and signed the purchase orders.[^3]

10     The accused showed Hidaya samples of fabric and shirts and Hidaya eventually placed an order for shirts. These shirts were labelled and sold under Mustafa’s house brands. Later, the accused managed to obtain the license to produce shirts under several international brands and brought these branded shirts to Mustafa around 2010.[^4]

11     Although the business seemed to be expanding, issues arose as to the financial aspects of the family companies. As SWT faced cash flow problems, SHM was incorporated on 10 April 2004 to give the accused a better sense of control. SHM would cater to the department store business and new customers. It also gave the second generation a chance to own a company of their own. Yak Zhao Ming, the daughter of the accused’s uncle Yak Thye Peng and his brother Yak Eng Siong also joined him at SHM. They were directors and shareholders of equal standing.[^5]

12     As SHM did not have capital, it relied on the credit facilities of SWT and SWE to fund business transactions.[^6] When SHM received sales proceeds for the goods it sold, the bulk of it would go towards repaying SWT. However, five to ten percent of the sales proceeds would be retained to run its day to day activities.[^7]

13     The cash flow situation did not improve after the incorporation of SHM and the accused felt that all his hard work was going to waste. In late 2008 or early 2009, he voiced his displeasure to his uncles. After some discussion, it was agreed between the accused and his uncles that commissions of $196,393 were due to SHM from SWT.[^8] This sum was reflected in the Unaudited Financial Statements of SHM dated 31 March 2010 (Exhibit D6).

14     The parties also agreed to start another company and SWA was incorporated on 31 July 2009. The shareholders and directors were the accused’s uncles Yak Thye Peng, Yak Tiong Liew, his brother Yak Eng Siong and the accused himself. The intention was for SHM to run the department store business, while SWA would sell branded apparel manufactured under license. In or around 2010, the accused started supplying branded apparel to Mustafa.[^9]

15     Sometime around 2010, the accused was informed by Mustaq that Mustafa was opening a new wing. The accused agreed to pay for the renovation of the premises so that his international brands such as Van Heusen, Pierre Cardin, Lee Cooper, Daniel Hechter and Arnold Palmer could be displayed there. The cost of renovation was about $100,000. The accused testified that due to image issues the international brand owners were not willing to deal with Mustafa, but he managed to convince them otherwise.[^10]

16     The prosecution alleged that the accused had on seven occasions from around December 2009 to May or June 2014, corruptly provided gratification to Hidaya and Shahul. It was not in dispute that they were agents of Mustafa. It was also not in dispute that the accused had conducted business with Mustafa via SHM from 2005 to 2011 and via SWA from 2012 onwards.[^11]

17     The accused denied giving any money to Shahul on any occasion at all. He admitted that he gave a total of $2,000 to Hidaya, but maintained that the money was for non-corrupt purposes. On the first occasion, he gave Hidaya $800 or $1,000 before 2014 to defray the costs of Hidaya’s pilgrimage. He admitted to giving Hidaya another $1,000 in 2014 as his wife was undergoing heart by-pass surgery.[^12]

## ELEMENTS OF THE OFFENCE

18     Section 6(1)(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (“PCA”) provides:-

> **Punishment for corrupt transactions with agents**

> 6.    If —

>> (a)    \[not relevant\]

>> (b)    any person corruptly gives or agrees to give or offers any gratification to any agent as an inducement or reward for doing or forbearing to do, or for having done or forborne to do any act in relation to his principal’s affairs or business, or for showing or forbearing to show favour or disfavour to any person in relation to his principal’s affairs or business; or

>> (c)    \[not relevant\],

> he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.

19     The parties agreed that there are four elements for an offence under s 6(b) of the PCA, namely:-[^13]

> (a)     The giving of a gratification to an agent;

> (b)     The gratification must have been given as an inducement or reward (for the conferment of a benefit);

> (c)     There was an objective corrupt element in the transaction; and

> (d)     The gratification was given with a guilty knowledge.

20     These elements were derived from the test set out in _Kwang Boon Keong Peter v Public Prosecutor_ (_“Peter Kwang”_) where the offender who had received gratification was charged under s 6(a) of the PCA. The elements set out there were adapted to the present case, where it was alleged that the accused had given gratification.

21     In _Public Prosecutor v Leng Kah Poh_ (_“Leng Kah Poh”_), the Court of Appeal stated at \[20\] that the first element would relate to the _actus reus_ of the offence while the other three would pertain to the _mens rea_. The court further stated at \[21\]:-

> 21     _Chan Wing Seng_ is instructive in the application of these elements. In that case, Yong CJ held that the fourth element of guilty knowledge refers to whether the accused knew or realised that what he did was corrupt by the ordinary and objective standard, and is a subjective test (at \[23\]). On the other hand, the third element of whether a transaction has a corrupt element is an objective inquiry that is essentially based on the ordinary standard of the reasonable man and the question is to be answered only after the court has found or inferred what the accused intended when he entered into the transaction.

## EVALUATION OF THE EVIDENCE

## The accused gave gratification to Hidaya and Shahul

22     In order to show that gratification was given, the prosecution relied on the evidence of Hidaya, four email sent by the accused to his sister, the accused’s statements to CPIB as well as cash withdrawals from the accused’s OCBC account. Shahul was not called to give evidence.

#### Hidaya’s evidence

23     Hidaya could not recall if the accused had given him money on the four occasions stated in the charges. However, he testified that the accused had given him money on two to three occasions. He would go to India once a year during the fasting month. Before he went, he would ask the accused for sample shirts. The accused would place the sample shirts in a plastic bag. In addition, the accused would also place a folded piece of paper containing cash in the same bag. The accused passed him the plastic bag containing the shirts and money at a taxi stand at Tekka, beside the MRT station. They met after 10 p.m. when Hidaya finished work.

24     Hidaya testified that he did not solicit any money from the accused.[^14] When the accused gave him money, it was for an amount of not less than $1,000 on each occasion. Neither of them would say anything when the money was handed over. Hidaya was unsure as to why the accused gave him the money, but thought the accused did so as he was going to India.[^15]

25     The prosecution applied to cross-examine Hidaya under s 156 of the Evidence Act (“EA”) on the basis that he was evasive and hostile. The prosecution also applied to have his statement to the CPIB admitted as evidence of the facts stated therein under s 147(3) of the EA. The defence did not object to the application.[^16]

26     In his statement to the CPIB dated 18 November 2014 (Exhibit P18), Hidaya admitted that the accused had given him money on about seven occasions and that each time, the amount would be $1,000. He stated that he thought that the accused had given him the money as “they support his business by choosing to buy shirts from SKH”. SKH was another company the accused used to trade with Mustafa. Hidaya further stated that he knew it was wrong to take the money as he purchased stock from SKH. However, since the accused gave him money, he just took it. The last time he took money from the accused was in June 2014 when the accused gave him $1,000. The accused did not tell him that the money was for “new year or fasting”.[^17]

27     While there was a discrepancy as to the frequency and amount of gratification between Hidaya’s statement and the charges, his statement could be relied on to show that he had received gratification from the accused and that he knew it was wrong to do so. This was not a bare admission on his part. His admission was fortified as he had disgorged himself of the gratification and handed over $7,000 to CPIB “for restitution purposes”.[^18] He testified that he had surrendered the money voluntarily and that no one forced him to do so.[^19] The total amount involved in the charges relating to Hidaya was also about $7,000. If he did not receive the money or received it innocently or was not corrupt, there would be no reason for him to have handed $7,000 to the CPIB.

#### The four email

28     The accused’s sister Yak Puay Khim was at the material time in charge of all the accounts of the family companies[^20]. At the time of trial, she was serving a sentence of imprisonment for embezzling several million dollars from the family companies. She was not called as a witness.

29     In the course of conducting business, the accused had sent four email to his sister which related to all the charges except the fourth charge. It was not in dispute that the accused had composed the four email and sent them from his work email account to his sister’s work email account.[^21] I will deal with the email in chronological order.

30     The accused’s email dated 28 December 2009 (Exhibit P6) (which related to the seventh charge) contained the subject matter “commission and salary”. It read:-

> For shm.

> Muthu side : 1700 sgd

> ash and my salary…

> then last time collection x 3%??? = ???

> before I leave for my trip, I have given 10k to shahul and slowly deduct … he need for his house purchase …

> so any payment come, 3% to give me direct…

31     His email dated 5 July 2011 (Exhibit P7) (which related to the third charge) contained the subject “shm”. The accused stated:-

> i paid uncle and shahul 5k these 2 months.

> use shm to pay.

32     In his email dated 8 July 2011 (Exhibit P8) (which related to the first and eighth charges) and which contained the subject “shm”, the accused stated:-

> i gave uncle 2 last night. He going to India…

> plus shahul 5. Total 7.

> for record.

33     Finally his email dated 23 August 2011 (Exhibit P9) (which related to the second and ninth charges), contained the subject matter “coms for august”. The accused informed his sister:-

> Muthu – 3k

> Shahul - 3k

> Uncle - 1.5k …

34     The accused agreed that a third party looking at the four email would think that he had given money to Hidaya and Shahul.[^22] However he did not think about the implications when writing the email.[^23] His defence was that he had sent the four email to his sister as a ruse to claim commissions due and owing to SHM (as shown in Exhibit D6) from his uncles.

#### Evidence relating to the first charg**e**

35     For the first charge, it was alleged that the accused gave Hidaya $2,000 in or around July 2011. The accused had in his email dated 8 July 2011 (Exhibit P8) stated, “i gave uncle 2 last night. He going to India.” In Exhibit P8, the accused also stated that he gave Shahul $5,000 and this will be dealt with when considering the evidence relating to the eighth charge.

36     It is clear on the face of Exhibit P8 that the accused had admitted to giving money to Hidaya. The accused had also admitted as such in his statement to CPIB made on 5 December 2014 (Exhibit P12). He stated at \[34\] that:-

> In this email I had informed Khim that I had given uncle Abdullah $2,000 the night before, which should be 7th July 2011, as he was going back to India.

37     He also informed CPIB that he told Khim that the information was for record purposes, but did not know if she kept a record of these payments. He had most probably passed the money to Hidaya near Tekka market which was near Hidaya’s home.[^24]

38     In his further statement recorded on 26 February 2015 (Exhibit P13), the accused confirmed that the content of Exhibit P12 was true and correct. He was shown a copy of his OCBC bank statement, which showed that he had withdrawn a sum of $1,000 on five occasions on 7 and 8 July 2011 (total $5,000). He stated at \[57\]:-

> … I wish to say that after I withdraw this $2,000, I had given the $2,000 to uncle Abdullah at the Tekka, near his house. I had given the $2,000 to Uncle Abdullah because he is going back to India. After I had given Uncle Abdullah this $2,000, I had went back and email my sister Khim Yak that I had given $2,000 to Uncle Abdullah.

39     In court, the accused sought to retract his statements to the CPIB and denied giving money to Hidaya. He claimed that when he sent Exhibit P8, his intention was to chase for SHM’s commissions for the previous two months. That was why the subject of the email was “shm”. He claimed that the email referred to payment for renovations at Mustafa’s new wing and thought that his uncles would be more agreeable to pay for renovations rather than for SHM’s commissions. He stated that as he was frustrated, he just shot off the email without thinking about its implications.[^25]

40     With respect to the withdrawals on 7 July 2011 and 8 July 2011 from his OCBC bank account, the accused testified that it must have been the case that his wife had asked for her allowance after he had just returned from Malaysia on a day trip. He therefore went to withdraw money for her. He also asserted that Hidaya did not go to India during that period as business was still going on.[^26]

41     In my view, the accused was being untruthful in his evidence when he denied giving $2,000 to Hidaya in July 2011. I rejected his claim that he was referring to renovation costs in Exhibit P8, since the email does not make reference to any renovation costs. His claim that he had written the email with the intention to claim commissions was incredible. As this is a common theme to several of the charges, the issue of whether the four email were written to claim commissions will be dealt with below.

42     The evidence against the accused to show that he gave gratification to Hidaya was compelling. He had sent Exhibit P8 to his sister soon after he had given Hidaya $2,000. It was written in the normal course of business. It implicated him and amounted to an admission. It was further supported by his statements to CPIB where he also admitted to giving Hidaya money.

43     The accused had even informed CPIB about how he obtained the money to pay Hidaya. His claim that he must have withdrawn the money for his wife’s expenses could not be believed as it was tentative and speculative. It was an afterthought as he failed to inform CPIB of this. As would be the case for the other charges, if he did not give the money, there would have been no good reason for him to implicate himself in his statements to the CPIB.

#### Evidence relating to the second charge

44     For the second charge, it was alleged that the accused had in or around August 2011 given $1,500 to Hidaya. In his email to his sister dated 23 August 2011 (Exhibit P9), he stated “Uncle 1.5k”.[^27] The email also referred to a payment of $3,000 to Shahul, and this will be dealt with when considering the evidence relating to the ninth charge.

45     When he was referred to his email, he explained to CPIB in Exhibit P12 at \[36\] that he emailed his sister to inform her that he “… had given … Uncle Abdullah $1,500 for August.” He stated that he had given Abdullah the money sometime in August 2011 and that he probably passed him the money in the vicinity of Mustafa.[^28] He had therefore admitted to CPIB that he had given Hidaya (who was also known as Abdullah) $1,500. In Exhibit P13, the accused stated that he did not recall how he managed to gather the money to pass to Hidaya as it was too long ago, but he reiterated that he had given Hidaya the money in the vicinity of Tekka.[^29]

46     In court, the accused testified that he sent Exhibit P9 to his sister to claim commissions for SHM, which were owing since April 2011. This was a difficult period of his life when he considered quitting and leaving everything behind. He did not even turn up for work regularly.[^30]

47     The evidence against the accused was compelling. If he did not give $1,500 to Hidaya, it would have been totally illogical for him to tell CPIB that he did so. I rejected his late assertion that he sent the email in order to claim commissions for SHM. As will be discussed below, his evidence was totally illogical and implausible.

#### Evidence relating to the third charge

48     For the third charge, it was alleged that the accused gave $5,000 to Hidaya and Shahul in or around July 2011. I will apportion this sum equally between them.

49     In his email dated 5 July 2011 (Exhibit P7), the accused stated, “i paid uncle and shahul 5k these 2 months. use shm to pay.” The accused conceded in court that the email indicated that he had given money to Hidaya and Shahul.[^31] Further, in Exhibit P12, the accused admitted that he sent the email to his sister to tell her that he had paid both Hidaya and Shahul a total of $5,000 during the past two months.[^32]

50     The accused testified that he had sent the email to his sister as he wanted to chase his uncles for SHM”s commissions for the period April to June 2011. He claimed that Exhibit P7 referred to renovation payments. He felt that as his uncle Yak Thye Peng seemed more comfortable paying for renovations than for commissions, he would stand a better chance of recovering money if he framed this as a renovation claim, instead of commissions due to SHM.[^33] This was an unsatisfactory explanation. The word “renovation” does not even appear in Exhibit P7 and nothing therein implied that it referred to renovations. His evidence was clearly an afterthought as he did not inform CPIB of what he claimed in court.

51     The accused had made three withdrawals of $1,000 each on 28 June 2011 from his OCBC bank account, and two further withdrawals of $1,000 each on 2 July 2011. When he was asked about these withdrawals by CPIB, he stated in Exhibit P13 that he could not recall how he gathered the $5,000 to give to Hidaya and Shahul.

52     The accused testified that he withdrew $2,000 to give to his mother and wife for household expenses. He withdrew a further $3,000 as he had to bring cash to Malaysia to pay the employees of Globe Span Sendirian Berhard which was also a family company. It was difficult to believe his evidence. He had failed to offer this explanation when he was questioned by CPIB about the entries and his account in court was clearly a made up afterthought. The fact that he withdrew the money around the time he was alleged to have paid gratification to Hidaya and Shahul would support the prosecution’s case that he did so.

#### Evidence relating to the fourth charge

53     For the fourth charge, it was alleged that the accused gave $1,000 to Hidaya around May or June 2014. In terms of the sequence of events, this would be the last occasion when gratification was given.

54     No email was sent regarding this payment. However, the accused had admitted in his statement to CPIB (Exhibit P11) that he had given money to Hidaya in 2014. He stated at \[21\]:-

> … I had given money to Abdullah once when he went for Haj and once this year because he told me that he wants to visit his wife who was not feeling well in India … For this recent trip to India, I had given him around $500 to $1,000.

55     The accused stated at \[23\] that when he learnt that Hidaya was going back to India, he told Hidaya that he would settle his air ticket. He then went to an ATM to withdraw $1,000 and passed him the money at Tekka. There was no real dispute that the accused had given money to Hidaya in May or June 2014. Hidaya also testified that the last time the accused gave him money was in June 2014.

#### Evidence relating to the seventh charge

56     For the seventh charge, it was alleged that in or around December 2009, the accused gave $10,000 to Shahul in the vicinity of Mustafa. In terms of sequence, this was the first time gratification was given.

57     To re-iterate, in his email dated 28 December 2009 (Exhibit P6), the accused stated that before he left for his trip, he gave $10,000 to Shahul as he needed it for his house purchase. He also informed his sister that if any payments came in, the money should be given directly to him. The accused agreed that anyone looking at Exhibit P6 would view it as inappropriate as he was giving money to a customer’s employee for personal reasons.[^34]

58     In Exhibit P12, the accused admitted to giving Shahul $10,000 and stated that he was asking his sister to reimburse him. The accused further admitted in Exhibit P13 that he had given Shahul $10,000.

59     In his testimony, the accused denied giving Shahul any money. He explained that SHM’s commissions for August to October 2009 had not been paid and he was getting frustrated by this. His salary and his brother’s salary were also due and owing.[^35] He therefore sent the email (Exhibit P6) under the subject heading “commission and salary”. The accused admitted that on a plain reading of his email:-[^36]

> … anyone who reads this will know that I have given money to Shahul. That’s what --- it is written there. But it’s the frustration that’s built up for me trying to talk to my uncles or even talk to my sister that I write such --- I never think of the --- you know, the implications that I --- I have to tell --- you know, come to Court to explain to you, Sir \[what\] actually happened in my mind during that time.

60     The accused testified that when he sent Exhibit P6 to his sister, he was just trying to recover commissions for SHM by misusing Shahul’s name.[^37] However, he failed to inform CPIB of this and had instead admitted to giving Shahul $10,000 in Exhibits P12 and P13. There was no reason to doubt the truth of the content of his email or his admissions to CPIB. There would be no reason for him to incriminate himself if he did not give Shahul the money.

61     When CPIB asked the accused about his OCBC bank statement which showed a cash withdrawal of $15,000 on 11 December 2009, he stated in Exhibit P13 that he could not recall how he gathered the $10,000 to pay Shahul as it happened too long ago. It was therefore surprising that the accused managed to recall at trial that he withdrew the money as well as other sums of money for a family holiday to Melbourne and Sydney from 11 December 2009 to 22 December 2009.[^38] The accused’s evidence was not credible as he had failed to offer an early explanation to CPIB as to what he used the money for. The withdrawal of a large sum of money around the time he was supposed to have given gratification to Shahul supported the prosecution’s case that he did so.

#### Evidence relating to the eight charge

62     For the eighth charge, it was alleged that the accused had given Shahul $5,000 in or around July 2011.

63     In his email dated 8 July 2011 (Exhibit P8) (which also related to the first charge), after stating that he gave $2,000 to Hidaya as he was going to India, the accused stated, “plus Shahul 5. Total 7.” He also stated “for record”.

64     The accused admitted in Exhibit P12 that he informed his sister that he had given Shahul $5,000, and that he probably did so in the vicinity of Mustafa.[^39] He also stated that he had provided the information to his sister for record purposes, but did not know if she kept a record of these payments. He had therefore given Hidaya and Shahul $7,000 during the past two months.

65     In court, the accused denied giving any money to Shahul on any occasion. His explanation for writing the email was the same as for the first charge i.e. that he was trying to claim commissions for SHM. Likewise, I did not accept his explanation and found that he gave $5,000 to Shahul.

#### Evidence relating to the ninth charge

66     For the ninth charge, the accused was alleged to have given Shahul $3,000 in or around August 2011.

67     In his email dated 23 August 2011 (Exhibit P9) (which also related to the second charge), the accused stated “Shahul 3k”. In Exhibits P12 and P13, the accused admitted to CPIB that he gave Shahul $3,000 in August 2011 and probably passed him the money in the vicinity of Mustafa.

68     In court, the accused denied giving any money to Shahul on any occasion. His explanation as to why he had written the email was the same as for the third charge. I also did not accept his explanation that he sent the email to claim commissions for SHM and found that he gave Shahul $3,000 in August 2011.

#### Evidence that the accused gave gratification to Hidaya and Sahul was compelling

69     The four email showed that the accused had given gratification to Hidaya and Shahul on six occasions. The accused agreed that taken at face value, the email showed that he did so.[^40] The four email were sent in the normal course of business, reasonably soon after payments were made. In my assessment full weight should be given to the email, which were fully supported by other evidence.

70     The accused confirmed the accuracy of the content of the four email in his statements to CPIB. Essentially, he admitted that he gave money to Hidaya and Shahul on all the occasions stated in the charges (including the fourth charge). Moreover, he elaborated on why he sent the four email and provided further details as to where and when he handed over the money to them. There was no reason to doubt the truth of his admissions. If he had not given them gratification, it was unthinkable that he would choose to incriminate himself, when he could have more easily denied doing so. On the contrary, his evidence in court was not convincing.

#### The accused’s explanation that he sent the four email to claim commissions due to SHM was totally unbelievable

71     The accused claimed that he wrote the four email out of pure frustration when he was in an emotional state. It was pure stupidity on his part to misuse the names of Hidaya and Shahul to recover commissions due to SHM. However, he could give no valid reason as to why he wrote the email. He stated in court, “So, I --- couldn’t give you a reason for it why --- what went wrong to my mental state during that time.”[^41] While he may have been depressed, there was no evidence to suggest that his depression caused or contributed to him writing what he claimed were false email.

72     It was inherently illogical that the four email could be used as a tool to claw back commissions from his uncles when they were not even copied in any of them. He did not instruct his sister to bring the four email to the attention of his uncles, nor did he know if she conveyed the information to them.[^42] It also defied logic that his uncles would be more inclined to reimburse him for possible bribes to senior employees of Mustafa, rather than pay commissions due to SHM.

73     On the contrary, the prosecution’s contention that the accused sent the four email to his sister so that she could keep track of what he gave Hidaya and Shahul as well as to seek reimbursement was far more logical.[^43] Having forked out the money for the family companies, it was logical that he would want to claim back the money.

#### The accused’s claim that he lied to CPIB about the purpose of the four email was untruthful

74     To explain why he admitted to CPIB that he gave money to Hidaya and Shahul, the accused’s position was in effect that he lied to CPIB. In my view, his explanation was untruthful and self-serving. He knew that CPIB were investigating him for corruption and that he had to tell the truth. It totally defied logic that as an educated businessman, he would lie and admit to giving gratification to Hidaya and Shahul if he did not do so. He knew the legal consequences of lying to CPIB.[^44] If indeed, the purpose of his four email was to claw back commissions due to SHM, the most logical thing would be to inform CPIB of this, instead of implicating himself. The accused’s false claims in court also showed that he was a person who was willing to resort to self-serving measures to advance his own interests.

75     His explanation as to why he failed to inform CPIB of his defence was implausible. From what could be discerned, he claimed that he did not have the relevant information as his documents had been seized by the Commercial Affairs Department and he could not think of how to properly explain his position to the CPIB officers.[^45] This was not a satisfactory explanation.

76     The four statements were recorded between 27 November 2014 and 29 December 2015. It was apparent that during this period, the accused failed to take any steps to obtain the documents he claimed he needed, or inform CPIB about the narrative which he relied on in court. It was open to the accused to state his defence in general terms or simply inform CPIB that he needed to refer to his documents to mount a full defence. There was no reason to incriminate himself and implicate Hidaya and Shahul if he did not in fact give them money.

77     If I am wrong in my findings and the accused did in fact lie to CPIB, the prosecution should consider whether it would be appropriate to prefer further charges against him.

#### The conclusion was that the accused had given gratification to Hidaya and Shahul

78     In view of the aforesaid, I found that the prosecution had established beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had given Hidaya and Shahul gratification on the occasions stated in the charges.

## Gratification was given as an inducement or reward / objective corrupt element

79     The issue of whether the gratification was given as an inducement or reward and whether there was an objective corrupt element form part of the same inquiry. In _Leng Kah Poh_, the court stated at \[22\]:-

> 22    With regards the second element of corruption under s 6(_a_), this is normally part of the same factual enquiry as the third element, as stated in _Chan Wing Seng_ and _Yuen Chun Yii v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 2 SLR(R) 209</span> (“_Yuen Chun Yii_”) and as recently followed in _Tey Tsun Hang v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 1189</span> (“_Tey Tsun Hang_”). As stated by Woo Bih Li J in _Tey Tsun Hang_ at \[17\]: Although the second and third elements \[as stated in _Peter Kwang_\] are conceptually different, they are part of the same factual enquiry. _The question is whether the recipient received the gratification believing that it was given to him as a quid pro quo for conferring a dishonest gain or advantage on the giver in relation to his principal’s affairs._ The court has treated these two elements together in its assessment of whether an offence is made out. Thus, _the causal, or consequential, link between the gratification and the act of favour alleged to be procured_ was examined … _under the rubric of an objective corrupt element._

#### No need to link any particular transaction to the gratification

80     In _Leng Kah Poh_, the Court of Appeal further stated at \[34\]:-[^46]

> In each case, it must be established that there is, first, a quid pro quo between the gift received or promised and the dishonest benefit or gain conferred against the principal’s interest…

81     The prosecution’s case was that the accused gave money to Hidaya and Shahul in order to purchase their servitude and sense of obligation. It contended that when money was given on multiple occasions over a period of time, there was no requirement to prove a nexus between the giving of the money and the act of the receiver. There was thus no need to link any particular transaction with the gratification the accused paid Hidaya and Shahul. I accepted this submission.

82     In _Fong Ser Joo William v Public Prosecutor_ \[2000\] 3 SLR (R) 12, Yong Pung How, CJ stated at \[25\]:-

> 25    In this regard, it should be noted that **it was not necessary for the Prosecution to prove that the appellant’s receipt of money from Chua was an inducement for a specific corrupt act or favour. It was sufficient for the Prosecution to show that the gratification was given in anticipation of some future corrupt act being performed**. It was stated in the recent case of Hassan bin Ahmad v PP <span class="citation">\[2000\] 2 SLR(R) 567</span> at \[20\]:

>> … It was therefore not necessary for the Prosecution to prove a nexus between each receipt and a particular act; it only sufficed to demonstrate that the payments were not made innocently, but to purchase the recipient’s servitude. This is the essence of being ‘bought over’ – that the recipient of the gratification be at the beck and call of the payor, prodded into action by his recollection of the payor’s generosity even when no specific act was demanded at the time of payment. ...

>> This was exactly what happened in this case when the district judge found that the appellant was receiving payments from Chua in exchange for exercising his powers and connections as a police officer as and when called upon to do so by Chua. The appellant had allowed himself to be “bought over” and to become beholden to Chua.

>> (emphasis added)

83     There was ample reason for the accused to want to purchase the servitude and sense of obligation of Hidaya and Shahul. Mustafa was the accused’s main customer with his other customer being CK Department Store (“CK”). He estimated that Mustafa accounted for 60% of the sales revenue, with CK accounting for the other 40%.[^47] By his own account, despite working extremely hard, the business was experiencing severe cash flow problems and costs of $100,000 were incurred to renovate the new wing of Mustafa. If he had two of the highest ranked employees in the shirts department in his pocket, he could count on them to show favour to his companies when the need arose.

84     The accused failed to provide any valid explanation as to why he gave significant sums of money to Hidaya and Shahul who were involved in Mustafa’s procurement processes. In Shahul’s case, he was also in charge of renovations and logistics. Instead of explaining why he gave them money, the accused testified untruthfully that he did not do so. In these circumstances, once I was satisfied that the accused had given money to Hidaya and Shahul, it would be difficult to find that he did so with innocent intentions. The natural inference was that he must have paid them gratification with the intention of making them beholden to him, so that they would be inclined whether visibly or not, to favour the business interests of the companies he represented.

#### The objective test

85     In _Public Prosecutor v Low Tiong Choon_, Yong, CJ provided guidance on how to determine if an objective corrupt element existed. He stated at \[29\]-\[31\]:-

> 29    Corruption is a question of intention (see Public Prosecutor v Datuk Haji Harun bin Haji Idris (No 2) <span class="citation">\[1977\] 1 MLJ 15</span> at 22), and from the passage above, it is apparent that there are two parts to establishing an objectively-corrupt element under the first limb. The first part is to ascertain the intention of the giver or receiver (as the case may be) behind the transaction at the material time, an inquiry which depends on the evidence of the parties concerned as well as the surrounding circumstances. The second part is then to ask whether such an intention tainted the transaction with an objectively-corrupt element, given the factual matrix. That is why this Court had stated in Chan Wing Seng (\[25\] supra) at \[20\] that:

>> Whether a transaction has a corrupt element is an objective inquiry that is essentially based on the ordinary standard of the reasonable man. This question is to be answered only after the court has inferred what the accused intended when he entered into the transaction. \[emphasis added\]

> In my view, to avoid potential confusion, it will be helpful if Prosecution and counsel applied this two-part approach when addressing the first limb in future cases.

> 30    It is of course an evidential exercise, sometimes a difficult one, when the court has to infer the accused’s intention behind the transaction – what was the accused’s intention or reason for giving or receiving the gratification? In this respect, the surrounding circumstances of the case will no doubt assist the judge in inferring what this intention or ulterior motive (if any) is. Hence, surreptitiousness or furtiveness of the transaction, the size of the gratification, relationship of the parties, breaking of rules or code may, as far as relevant, form part of that surrounding circumstances which, together with all the other evidence, will point towards the proper intention to be inferred.

> 31    Once the inference is drawn, the next question is to place such an intention or ulterior motive (as ascertained by the court) within the factual matrix and ask whether it infected the transaction with a corrupt element by the ordinary and objective standard…

86     In the present case, as will be seen below, the circumstances show that the accused’s motives in giving gratification to Hidaya and Shahul could not have been innocent.

#### Mustafa did not allow employees to take money

87     Lee Kheow Wee (“Lee”) (PW1), the Chief Executive Officer of Mustafa[^48] emphasized that Mustafa did not allow any of its employees to take money from suppliers.[^49] Once employees were obligated, they could do a lot of things to the advantage of the suppliers, which would be bad for Mustafa’s interests.[^50] The employees could make inaccurate orders which would lead to overstocking of inventory, higher pricing and inferior quality of merchandize.[^51] Staff could order items that do not move well, or purchase items in colours, cutting or fabric which were not in demand.[^52] Staff may also fail to check on the workmanship of the products.[^53]

88     Lee also testified that Mustafa’s stance that employees should not take money from suppliers was known across the board.[^54] Hidaya had also testified that it was wrong to take money from a supplier as it would appear “like we are giving him an advantage.”[^55] Likewise Shahul must have known it was wrong to do so.

#### Gratification was substantial and given over a period of time

89     The total amount of gratification the accused gave Hidaya and Shahul was $27,500. The amount given on each occasion was also substantial and ranged between $1,000 to $10,000. The gratification was given between December 2009 to August 2011 for the first six occasions, with the final one (relating to the fourth charge) being given in May or June 2014. At the material time, Hidaya and Shahul each earned around $3,000 per month, and the amount of gratification they received was substantial in relation to their salaries. By no means could the amounts given to them be considered as tokens of appreciation.

#### Gratification was handed over furtively

90     The circumstances under which the money was given indicated that the gift of money was objectively corrupt. The accused did not give the money to Hidaya and Shahul openly at the premises of Mustafa during working hours when he visited the premises. Rather, he handed the money to them after their working hours near Mustafa’s premises. Hidaya testified that nothing was said when the accused handed him the plastic bag containing the money. Neither he nor Shahul had declared the receipt of the money to the management of Mustafa. Nor did the accused inform anyone at Mustafa that he had given them money - not even to Mustaq whom he claimed to be close to.

#### No other suppliers gave money

91     Apart from the accused, no other suppliers gave Hidaya substantial sums of money.[^56] However, he had received a token $10 red packet for Chinese New Year, but had tried to reject the money. His evidence in cross-examination was as follows:-[^57]

> Q    Mr. Hidaya, did any other supplier of Mustafa other than Mr. Hwee, give you a $1,000 on occasions when you went back to India?

> A    Not---no one at all. They have given me a $10 in a packet for a Chinese New Year. Although I have rejected, they have forced me to take the money.

> Q    And can I ask why did you reject their $10 red packet?

> A    I’m not a small child. There’s no necessity to give me.

92     In contrast, Hidaya did not adopt the same principled approach towards the gratification he received from the accused. He did not attempt to reject the money or try to return it, even though nothing was said when the accused gave him the money. This indicated that in his mind, he received the money corruptly. If he had received the money innocently, he would not have voluntarily surrendered $7,000 to CPIB.

93     There was no evidence to suggest that any other supplier gave money to Shahul either. By giving substantial amounts of gratification to Hidaya and Shahul to cultivate them, the accused must have sought to advance the business interest of his companies over that of Mustafa’s other suppliers. The circumstances indicated that since Hidaya and Shahul only took money from the accused and no other suppliers, it would only be natural if they developed a sense of servitude and obligation towards him.

#### Payments to Shahul

94     The accused had given Shahul gratification on four occasions. On the first occasion, he gave Shahul $10,000 in December 2009 (7th charge). In July 2011, he gave Shahul $5,000 (8th charge). On another occasion in July 2011, he gave Shahul and Hidaya $5,000 (3rd charge). On the last occasion, he gave Shahul $3,000 in August 2011 (9th charge). The accused had therefore given Shahul a total of $20,500.[^58]

95     The accused knew that Shahul was a supervisor who was ranked directly below Hidaya. According to Hidaya, when he was not around, Shahul could replenish the stock, but the purchase orders had to be countersigned by Mustaq.[^59] The accused was evasive as to whether Shahul had the authority to sign purchase orders. However he must have known that Shahul could do so, since purchase orders signed by Shahul were handed to him, as was the case for Exhibit P16 (“pre-purchase” form dated 28 October 2009).[^60]

96     Perhaps more importantly, Shahul was also in charge of renovations. This would include the renovation of Mustafa’s new wing. In Exhibit P11 at \[26\], the accused stated:-

> …When Mustafa wanted to change their display shelf which sells our products, Shaul will inform his management about his proposal. Shaul would then call the contractor down to Mustafa to discuss how to create and purchase the fixture. Shaul will then inform me their plans and the price of the project and he would want me to sponsor Mustafa with the renovation…

97     For the payment of $10,000 which the accused gave to Shahul in December 2009 (7th charge), the accused stated in Exhibit P12:-[^61]

> Q4    Why did you give S$10,000 to Shaul Hameed”

> A4    He told me needed money for renovation. I wish to say that Shaul Hameed is in charge of logistic and renovation of Mustafa. I see he had worked very hard for shirt counters that our company manufactured and garments are selling. Therefore I had given him the money as a token of appreciation for his hard work and I treat him as my personal friend.

98     The accused therefore appreciated that Shahul had an important role to play in the logistical operations and renovations of Mustafa and that he had the ability to influence things in the accused’s favour. There was ample reason for the accused to want Shahul to be beholden to him.

99     It was not clear if Shahul had solicited the money or whether the accused had on his own initiative given Shahul $10,000 for the purposes of his house. The accused was evasive about the nature of the payment in his statements to CPIB. He even claimed in his fourth statement (Exhibit P14)[^62] that the $10,000 was a loan and that Shahul had returned him the money in small amounts. The accused had however abandoned this position at trial nor did he assert that he had any friendship with Shahul.

100    Further, the accused had in cross-examination conceded that any gift of $10,000 to Shahul for a personal reason would be inappropriate:-[^63]

> Q    Alright. Now, yesterday, you admitted that this particular 2nd last line \[of his statement\] would look to a 3rd party like, you are giving Mr. Shahul $10,000, yes?

> A    Yes.

> Q    And with the reasons stated in there, house purchase, it will in fact, read like you’re giving him money for a personal reason, correct?

> A    Yes.

> Q    And you agree that any the party looking at this email, taking the words literally, would view it as inappropriate because you are giving money to a customer’s employee for a personal reason?

> A    Yes.

101    The amount of $10,000 is a significant sum and was more than three times Shahul’s monthly salary. If there was an innocent explanation, it would have been incumbent on the accused to be upfront about the payment (which he was not) and to testify as to why he gave such a large sum of money to Shahul. However, he failed to provide any explanation for this.

102    With respect to all the charges, the accused stated in Exhibit P12[^64] that he gave money to Shahul (as well as Hidaya) as a token of appreciation for doing a good job and as their sales had gone up by 20%. He said, “I wish to say that the shirt counter carries garment from my company and other company. My company’s sales increased by around 20% to 30%.” It can therefore be seen that the accused had admitted to rewarding Shahul and Hidaya for things they did in relation to Mustafa’s business of selling shirts. He was also mindful that he had other competitors and that he was not the only one supplying shirts to Mustafa.

103    In the absence of any legitimate reason for the accused giving such significant sums of money to Shahul, the inference to be drawn from the available facts and circumstances was that the accused gave the money to Shahul in order to purchase his servitude and sense of obligation so that he would show favour towards the business interests of the companies the accused represented.

#### Payments to Hidaya

104    The accused first started giving money to Hidaya in or around July 2011. He gave Hidaya $2,000 on one occasion in July 2011 (first charge). On a second occasion in July 2011, he gave Hidaya and Shahul $5,000 (third charge). He next gave Hidaya $1,500 in or around August 2011 (second charge). On the last occasion, he gave Hidaya $1,000 in May or June 2014 (fourth charge). He had thus given Hidaya $7,000.

105    While the individual and total amounts given to Hidaya were not as large as in the case of Shahul, they were still substantial and could not be regarded as mere tokens of appreciation.

106    The accused knew that Hidaya had the final authority to decide on the fabric and design of shirts, and that he had full authority to decide on the price. He also knew that Hidaya was capable of changing his mind at any time.[^65] It was not easy to do business with Hidaya. The accused’s evidence was that after agreeing on the quality and quantity, the price would be “the final hurdle” to the completion of a sale.[^66] Hidaya would even demand a reduction of the price after the unit price had been agreed upon.[^67]

107    Contrary to what the accused had claimed, there was good reason to have Hidaya obligated to him. For a start, it could have made dealings with Hidaya easier. While the defence asserted that Hidaya was incorruptible as he was strict throughout when dealing with the accused, this was only a matter of degree. Only he would have known if he had exercised leniency as this would not be something visible to others. Objectively, Hidaya was shown to be corrupt as he had made restitution of $7,000 to CPIB. If he did not accept the accused’s money corruptly, it would be inconceivable for him to pay such a large sum to CPIB.

108    The accused testified that he had given money to Hidaya out of friendship on two occasions. On the first occasion, he gave him money as he was going to Mecca. It was not clear if this related to any of the charges. On the second occasion, he gave money as Hidaya was going to India to see his sick wife. Based on the dates, it was likely that this related to the fourth charge.

109    The accused claimed that Hidaya was his mentor and friend who had guided him and taught him when he was just starting out in 2002. The evidence painted a different picture. Apart from having a business relationship, it was doubtful that the accused had any other relationship with Hidaya. The tenor of Hidaya’s evidence was that only a buyer and supplier relationship existed between the accused and him. He stated:-[^68].

> Q    Can you use a word or two to describe your relationship with Mr. Wee in 2011?

> A    He is a supplier to Mustafa and I am the buyer on behalf of Mustafa. That’s about it. No other relationship.

> Q    Okay. Can you use a word or two to describe your relationship with Mr. Wee in 2014?

> A    He was doing a good business with Mustafa. He has good quality goods, unlike other suppliers. So the relationship was a friendly one.

> Q    Okay. Was your relationship with him in 2014 the same as 2011 or different? The---

> A    The 2011---

> Q    supplier-buyer relationship.

> A    2011?

> Q    Yes.

> A    Just the same. Nothing different.

110    Although Hidaya had suggested that the accused had given him money out of friendship when led by Defence Counsel, he unequivocally denied this in re-examination:-[^69]

> Q    In which year would you say you started considering Mr. Hwee as a friend?

> A    I didn’t think that he was a friend. We were close because of the business dealings.

> Q    So, may I please clarify, whenever Ms. Sangeetha used the word “friend” or “friendship” when she questioned you, what do you understand by that?

> A    I’ve been doing a business with him for a long time. In that context, I was close to him. That was what I meant.

111    As it was doubtful that the accused had any friendship with Hidaya, I rejected the defence that he gave money to Hidaya out of friendship. This finding would apply to the fourth charge and if applicable, to the other charges as well. Even if a friendship existed, this did not mean that the payment of money could not be for the purposes of cultivating Hidaya. It would be doubtful that such large sums of money would be given gratuitously without expecting something in return. In the absence of a valid explanation, the natural inference was that by paying Hidaya, the accused’s intention was to gain his servitude and sense of obligation for business purposes.

112    I rejected any claim by the defence that Mustafa needed the accused more than they needed him and that he had no reason to pay any gratification to Hidaya and Shahul. While his companies might have been the sole licensee of particular brands, Mustafa would have also carried competing brands. Mustafa was the accused’s largest client in Singapore. His companies had cash flow issues and it was by his own admission a difficult time in his life. He would have wanted to lower costs and increase sales and to ensure that business with Mustafa went on smoothly. Thus, contrary to what the defence contended, it was self-serving for the accused to want to pay Mustafa’s senior employees to be under his servitude.

#### The accused’s intention tainted his dealings with Mustafa with an objective corrupt element

113    The prosecution’s case was that by giving large sums of money to Hidaya and Shahul, the inference to be drawn was that the accused was attempting to cultivate them and continuously remain in their good books in order to advance the business interests of his companies with Mustafa.[^70] I agreed with this. The accused had no valid reason to give significant sums of money to them. He must have done so to make them conflicted and beholden to him. Any dealings with them would accordingly be objectively tainted. As Hidaya stated, “Accepting money from him is wrong, because other people may think that I’m doing something to his advantage and he can also make use of that”.[^71]

#### Payments were objectively corrupt on the totality of the evidence

114    For the reasons which appear above, I found that the payments given by the accused to Hidaya and Shahul were on the totality of the evidence, objectively corrupt.

## The gratification was given with a guilty knowledge

115    The next issue would be whether the accused knew or realized that what he did was corrupt by the ordinary and objective standard.[^72] I found that he gave the gratification with a guilty knowledge. As has been discussed above, the accused knew that giving money to employees of Mustafa for personal reasons was inappropriate, but nonetheless proceeded to do so. He refused to explain to the court why he had made the payments. Instead, he deliberately told untruths to mislead the court on material issues. He was untruthful about the purpose of the four email so that he could deny giving gratification to Hidaya and Shahul. If he had nothing to hide or if the payments were made innocently, he should have come clean, admitted that he had given the money and provided an explanation for the court’s consideration. However, he did not do so. In my view, his lack of candour and evasiveness was evidence of his guilty knowledge.

## CONCLUSION

116    For the reasons aforesaid, I found that the prosecution had discharged its burden of proving all seven charges against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. The accused was therefore found guilty and convicted on the seven charges.

## SENTENCE

117    The accused had no antecedents. He had instructed new counsel for the purposes of sentencing. Counsel stated that the accused was 44 years old. He was supporting various family members including his aged parents, his wife, and his four young children. He was also supporting the three children of his sister Yak Puay Khim who was serving sentence. His uncles had commenced multiple legal suits against him, which had strained the relationship between his uncles and him. He could no longer rely on them for support. The accused was still continuing to supply Mustafa with shirts through another company. No real loss was suffered by Mustafa and there were no issues relating to overstocking, inferior quality or overpricing. The court was informed that the accused was convinced that he committed no wrong and submitted that a fine of $3,000 per charge should be imposed. Overall, I did not think that any significant mitigating factors were raised.

118    In _Public Prosecutor v Syed Mostofa Romel_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 1166</span>. Sundaresh Menon, CJ had classified corruption cases into three broad and non-exhaustive categories. The present case would fall under Category 1, where:-[^73]

> … the receiving party is paid to confer on the paying party a benefit that is within the receiving party’s power to confer, without regard to whether the paying party ought properly to have received that benefit. This is typically done at the payer’s behest.

119    In Category 1 cases, whether the custodial threshold was crossed would depend on the facts:-[^74]

> A case falling within the first category occurs, for example, where the receiving party purchases or favourably recommends the goods or services offered by the paying party. This was what happened in Ang Seng Thor. In this category, whether the custodial threshold is crossed will depend on the facts.

120    In the present case, there were three main aggravating factors. The total amount of gratification was $27,500 and was quite large. Gratification was given on seven occasions over a period of five years, although there was a significant gap between the last two occasions. More importantly, the accused had targeted the top two employees in the shirts department of Mustafa. In view of the accused’s culpability, the custodial threshold had been crossed, notwithstanding that the prosecution could not establish that either Hidaya or Shahul had shown actual favour.

121    The prosecution sought a term of imprisonment of between three to eight weeks’ imprisonment per charge, based on the quantum of the gratification involved. In totality, they sought a sentence of seventeen weeks’ imprisonment.[^75]

122    The prosecution’s sentencing position for the individual charges was amply supported by the table of sentencing precedents it tendered and I was of the view that the individual sentences proposed were not excessive. However, taking into account the totality of sentence, I calibrated some of proposed individual sentences downwards. Thus, for the first, second and fourth charges where the amounts involved were $2,000 and under, I imposed a sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment. For the ninth charge where the amount involved was $3,000, I imposed a sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment. For the third and eight charges, where the amount involved was $5,000, I imposed a sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment per charge. Lastly for the seventh charge, where the gratification involved was $10,000, I imposed a sentence of eight weeks’ imprisonment. The sentences in the first, third and seventh charges were to run consecutively, so that the accused would serve a total of fourteen weeks’ imprisonment.

123    The total sentence imposed was proportional to the nature of offences committed and is not manifestly excessive. The total sentence compares favourably to _Public Prosecutor v Murugesan Moorthy_ (DAC 913243-2018) where the offender who had given a total gratification $26,000 in return for business, but where no actual favour was shown, was sentenced to a total of fourteen weeks’ imprisonment.
