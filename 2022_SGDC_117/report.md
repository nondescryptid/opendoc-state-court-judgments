3       At the conclusion of the trial on 27 January 2022, I found the Accused guilty of all the nine proceeded charges and I accordingly convicted him of all the nine charges. I then adjourned the matter to 10 March 2022 for the Prosecution to prepare their sentencing position and for the Defence to prepare their mitigation plea.

4       On 10 March 2022, after considering the Prosecution’s submission on sentence and the Accused’s mitigation plea, I imposed a fine of $5,500 per charge in default 10 days’ imprisonment. As I had convicted the Accused of all nine similar charges, the total sentence was an aggregate fine of $49,500 in default 90 days’ imprisonment.

5       The Accused, being dissatisfied with my decision, had filed his Notice of Appeal against his conviction and sentence. I hereby set out my reasons for the conviction and sentence.

## Prosecution’s Case[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

### The charges against the Accused

6       The Prosecution had submitted that in gist, each of the nine charges related to the Accused handling a sum of monies on nine separate occasions that was received by the Accused from PW3 by way of bank transfer into his personal DBS Savings Account. In entering into a lease transaction to rent PW4’s Property, PW3 was contractually obliged to make payment of these said sums of monies to PW4. However, the Accused had instructed PW3 to, and PW3 had made payment of these monies through the Accused as a conduit.

### Prosecution’s position on transaction monies under Regulation 7(1)(b)

7       The Prosecution had submitted that the various sums of monies handled by the Accused, as detailed in the nine charges, were within the ambit of transaction monies within Regulation 7 of the Regulations.

8       The Prosecution had also submitted that all the rental monies which the Accused had received from PW3 were monies in relation to the lease of PW4’s Property. And as the Accused was not allowed to hold or handle any of the transaction monies relating to the lease of PW4’s Property, by collecting the monthly rental from PW3 for PW4, the Accused was caught by Regulation 7(1)(b) of the Regulations, and he was guilty of the offence under Regulation 7(1)(b)[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2).

## Defence Case[^3]

9       In the present case, it was clear from the Accused’s submissions, as well as his testimony and from the way he cross-examined the Prosecution’s witnesses, that the Accused’s defence was as follows:

> (a)     The Accused had taken the position that he was not acting as PW4’s estate agent in the rental of the Property and that he was the estate agent for PW3 for that transaction.

> (b)     The Accused also took the position that his role as estate agent for PW3 had ended when the tenancy agreement for the Property was signed on 29 April 2018 and the keys to the Property were handed to PW3 on 11 May 2018. As such Regulation 7 of the Regulations was not applicable to him as PW3’s estate agent after 11 May 2018 and all the charges which had reference to dates after the 11 May 2018 were invalid and improper.

> (c)     In relation to the 2nd to the 9th Charges, as for monthly rental which he had collected from PW3 for PW4 for the months of June 2018 till January 2019, the Accused’s position was that these monies were not transaction monies covered under Regulation 7 of the Regulations as the Accused was no longer a salesperson for PW3 relating to the lease of the Property during this period. The Accused had submitted that he was only helping PW4 to collect the monthly rentals as a friend and he had been authorised by PW4 to collect the monies on his behalf.

> (d)     With regard to the 1st Charge, the Accused had submitted that PW4 had owed him monies which he had paid on behalf of PW4 for outstanding HDB loans, town council charges, repairs for PW4’s Property as well as the purchase of furniture and electrical appliances and he was therefore allowed to deduct whatever PW4 owed him from the rental monies that he had collected from PW3 on behalf of PW4 as reimbursement. Moreover, PW4 had signed a letter of authority/consent in respect of the same.

## Parties’ evidence and exhibits

### Prosecution’s evidence and exhibits

11     In addition to the 4 witnesses, the Prosecution had also tendered a total of twenty-four exhibits in support of their case against the Accused[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4).

12     The Prosecution’s evidence could be summarised as follows: -

#### PW2 – Lim Chuen Liang Jonathan Johnson

13     PW2 was an investigation officer with the Council for Estate Agent “(“CEA”). and PW2 was assigned to the Accused’s case in mid July 2018[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5).

14     PW2 had testified that the First Information Report[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) was lodged by a Mr Yew Wang Kooi (“Yew”) who had lodged the complaint on behalf of his Korean friend. Yew’s Korean friend had wanted to rent the whole Property but he was asked by the Accused to sign a tenancy for room rental instead. Yew’s Korean friend was also asked by the Accused to transfer the rental deposit and the monthly rental into the Accused’s personal bank account[^7]. However, Yew’s Korean friend did not proceed to rent the Property after signing the room tenancy agreement[^8].

15     After PW2 had received the First Information Report, he proceeded to inform the Housing and Development Board (“HDB”) about the rental agreement as HDB regulations might have been breached[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9). PW2 also testified that the complaint by Yew’s Korean friend was not the subject matter of the present charges that the Accused was facing[^10].

16     After PW2 had informed HDB of Exhibit P11, HDB conducted an inspection of the Property on 17 October 2018 and they informed PW2 that they had spoken to PW3 who was current tenant of the Property[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11). PW2 then contacted PW3 and proceeded to interview PW3[^12].

17     PW2 testified that the owner of the said Property was PW4 and the salesperson who was in charge of the leasing of the Property was the Accused[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13).

18     PW2 also testified that:

> (a)     PW4 had informed PW2 that he had given the Accused the authority to manage the Property[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14).

> (b)     PW4 had filed a police report on 7 July 2020 (Exhibit D1) where PW4 had stated that _“Around early 2018, I borrowed four thousands plus from my property agent Mr Lee (Lee Han Sing)… Regarding the rental fees and house maintenance of this unit, I gave permission to Mr Lee to handle it. So Mr Lee can deduct the money from the rental fees for the money I owed him. Authorisation letter for Mr Lee to handle all these was submitted to CEA on 2019… CEA filed a complaint against him (Mr Lee) for collecting rental fees on my behalf illegally. I wish to state that this allegation made is not true as I have given permission for Mr Lee to collect the rental fees on my behalf. To add on to that, the authorisation letter to Mr Lee to collect the rental on my behalf to CEA in 2018, I feel that CEA has misplaced this important letter.”_

> (c)     PW2 also testified that he had never received any documents relating to the rental of the Property from PW4 directly and all the documents that he had received had come from the Accused[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15).

#### PW3 – Rowell Censon Dela Cruz

19     PW3 was a Filipino working in Singapore, and he was looking to rent a whole flat for himself, his wife and his young son[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16). PW3 had found the Property through an advertisement in PropertyGuru and he had responded to the advertisement[^17]. The Accused was the salesperson who had advertised the rental of the Property[^18].

20     PW3 then proceeded to iMessage the Accused and he first contacted the Accused at around 6 pm on 28 April 2018. PW3 then arranged with the Accused for a viewing and the Accused did arrange for a viewing of the Property and he was the one who had opened the door and had shown PW3 and his family the Property when they went to view the Property[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19).

21     After viewing the Property, PW3 had sent a message to the Accused at 8.15 pm on 29 April 2018 offering to pay $1400 a month without agent fees for a one-year contract with the moving in date to be in May 2018[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20). The Accused informed PW3 that his offer was not acceptable because he was required to pay the agent fees[^21]. PW3 then decided to pay the agent fee of $700 and he arranged to meet up with the Accused at around 10 pm on 29 April 2018 to sign the paperwork for the renting of the Property[^22]. PW3 proceeded to sign the room rental agreement[^23] when he met the Accused on 29 April 2018[^24].

22     PW3 testified that the monthly tenancy was supposed to start on 19 May 2018 and rental was $1400 a month[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25). PW3 also said that although the rental agreement was stated as a “Room Rental Agreement”[^26], the understanding between him and the Accused was that he could use the whole of the Property and he would be sleeping in the master bedroom with his son[^27] and effectively PW3 would get to use the whole unit[^28].

23     PW3 also testified that it was stated in the Room Rental Agreement that the rental was to be paid into PW4’s POSB account no. XXX[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29) and the Accused was the one who had written PW4’s bank account into the Room Rental Agreement[^30]. PW3 also understood that when he signed the tenancy agreement, he would be required to pay one month’s rental in advance and the equivalent of one month’s rental as rental deposit[^31] totalling $2,800[^32].

24     PW3 also signed an Exclusive Estate Agency Agreement[\[note: 33\]](#Ftn_33) with the Accused on 29 April 2018[^34] whereby PW3 had agreed to pay the Accused his salesperson’s commission of $700 for the rental of the Property[^35].

25     After PW3 had signed the Room Rental Agreement and the Exclusive Estate Agency Agreement, the Accused sent an iMessage to PW3 and requested PW3 to pay the initial payments to the Accused’s DBS Saving Plus account no. XXX instead of PW4’s bank account[\[note: 36\]](#Ftn_36). PW3, after receiving the Accused’s instruction, did transfer a sum of $2,000 into the Accused’s bank account and the Accused had acknowledged receipt of the monies[^37]. PW3 testified that the payment of $2,000 was for the initial payment of the one months’ deposit and for the estate agent’s commission[^38]. PW3 said that initial $2,000 which he had transferred to the Accused consisted of $749 for the estate agents’ commission and $1,251 being part of the one month’s deposit[^39].

26     PW3 also said that the Accused had WhatsApp PW3 and informed PW3 of the following[\[note: 40\]](#Ftn_40):

27     PW3 testified that the balance payment of $800 was due before he moved into the Property[\[note: 41\]](#Ftn_41) and PW3 had paid the balance amount on 6 May 2018[^42]. As for the rental for June 2018, PW3 had asked the Accused as to which bank account he should transfer the payment for the June rental into and the Accused had sent him a WhatsApp on 19 June 2018 and had requested him to make the payment into any of the following accounts which belonged to the Accused[^43]:

> (a)     DBS Saving Plus XXX

> (b)     OCBC Current XXX

> (c)     UOB Saving XXX

28     PW3 said that he had to ask the Accused where he had to transfer the June rental payment to because there was an arrangement whereby PW3 was to transfer the initial monthly rental payments to the Accused because the Accused had to purchase some furniture such as a new bed, a new TV and cabinets for the Property[\[note: 44\]](#Ftn_44).

29     PW3 also said that after the payment of $3,549 (i.e., $2,800 and $749), PW3 had also paid the Accused the monthly rentals for the Property which were meant for PW4 on the following dates[\[note: 45\]](#Ftn_45):

> (a)     The sum of $1,410 (being $1,400 for the rental payment for June 2018 and $10 for the application to HDB to rent the Property) on 19 June 2018[\[note: 46\]](#Ftn_46). I also noted from Page 14 and 15 of Exhibit P19 that PW3 had informed the Accused that he had transferred the $1,410 to the Accused’s DBS account and the Accused had acknowledged receipt of the payment[^47].

> (b)     As for the July rental payment, PW3 testified that he had transferred $1,400 into the Accused’s DBS account and he had sent the evidence of payment to the Accused by WhatsApp on 20 July 2018[\[note: 48\]](#Ftn_48). PW3 said that he had transferred the monies into the Accused’s DBS account as he was instructed by the Accused to do so[^49].

> (c)     For the August rental payment, PW3 testified that he had paid $1,400 to the Accused’s DBS account and he had sent the evidence of payment to the Accused by WhatsApp on 19 August 2018[\[note: 50\]](#Ftn_50).

> (d)     For the September rental payment, PW3 said that the Accused had WhatsApp PW3 on 17 September 2018 and the Accused informed PW3 that PW4 had requested PW3 to make the payment before PW4 went overseas the following day. PW3 then went on to ask the Accused how he was supposed to pay the monies and the Accused told PW3 that he could pay the monies to the Accused and the Accused would then transfer the monies to PW4[\[note: 51\]](#Ftn_51). PW3 then proceeded to transfer the $1,400 from his bank account to the Accused’s DBS account[^52]. After transferring the $1,400 to the Accused’s DBS account, PW3 proceeded to WhatsApp the Accused with the evidence of payment[^53].

> (e)     As for the October rental payment, PW3 testified that the Accused had WhatsApp him on 19 October 2018 and had reminded him to make the October rental payment. PW3 then proceeded to ask the Accused if the payment was to be transferred to the Accused’s account and the Accused confirmed the same. PW3 then proceeded to transfer the $1,400 from his bank account to the Accused’s DBS account[\[note: 54\]](#Ftn_54). After PW3 had paid the $1,400 to the Accused, he proceeded to WhatsApp the evidence of payment to the Accused[^55].

> (f)     PW3 testified that he was supposed to pay the rental deposit and monthly rental from May to October 2018 to the Accused because PW4 owed the Accused monies[\[note: 56\]](#Ftn_56). However, PW3 continued to pay the monthly rental payment to the Accused directly after October 2018 because the Accused had instructed him to continue with the arrangement[^57]. As for the November rental payment, PW3 transferred the $1,400 from his bank account to the Accused’s bank account on 19 November 2018[^58].

> (g)     PW3 also transferred $1,300 from his bank account to the Accused’s bank account on 19 December 2018 for the December rental payment[\[note: 59\]](#Ftn_59). PW3 said that he had paid the Accused $1,300 instead of $1,400 because sometime in November 2018, the aircon unit in the Property had broken down and it was replaced by the Accused. However, the Accused did not have enough money to pay for the replacement aircon bracket and PW3 had paid the aircon technician $100 for the replacement bracket. PW3 then proceeded to deduct $100 from the December rental payment[^60].

> (h)     As for the January 2019 rental payment, PW3 transferred $1,400 from his bank account to the Accused’s DBS bank account on 19 January 2019[\[note: 61\]](#Ftn_61).

30     PW3 testified that throughout the entire period from April 2018 till January 2019, PW3 had never paid any of the rental monies for the property directly to PW4. All the payments for this whole period were paid to the Accused on behalf of PW4. PW3 had made all the payments by way of bank transfers to the Accused’s bank account[\[note: 62\]](#Ftn_62). PW3 also testified that he did continue to rent the Property after January 2019. After January 2019, PW3 had paid the monthly rental for the Property directly to PW4[^63].

#### PW4 – Lai Howe Yew

31     PW4 was the owner of the Property. PW4 had known the Accused for more than ten years and he knew that the Accused was working as a salesperson and an estate agent[\[note: 64\]](#Ftn_64).

32     PW4 testified that after he had gotten to know the Accused, he had borrowed monies from the Accused on a number of occasions[\[note: 65\]](#Ftn_65). There was one occasion when PW4 did not have any money to pay for the housing loan and conservancy charges and he had asked the Accused for assistance[^66]. PW4 had also borrowed monies from the Accused on things related to the Property and he would usually repay the Accused through instalment payments from the rental that he would receive from the rental of the Property[^67].

33     I noted that although PW4 had testified that he owed the Accused money, PW4 was unable to explain clearly the nature of his debt to the Accused. PW4 had testified that when he decided to rent the Property to PW3, he had owed the Accused $4000 plus for housing loan and conservancy charges[\[note: 68\]](#Ftn_68) and he had therefore sought the Accused’s assistance to look for tenants for the Property[^69]. However, PW4 subsequently changed his evidence to say that the $4000 plus owing was for HDB loans arrears, Town Council conservancy charges and repair works[^70]. PW4 went on to say that the repair works included the TV, the window grills, the cooker hob, the fridge[^71].

34     PW4 also confirmed that he had signed the Room Tenancy Agreement[\[note: 72\]](#Ftn_72) with PW3 and PW3 was supposed to pay the rental to PW4’s bank account at POSB account no, XXX[^73].

35     As for the rental deposit and advance rental, PW4 said that under the Room Tenancy Agreement, PW3 was supposed to pay him a security deposit of $1,400 and advance rental of $1,400 when they signed the tenancy agreement[\[note: 74\]](#Ftn_74). However, PW3 did not pay the monies directly to PW4 and it was the Accused who had helped PW4 to collect the $2,800 from PW3 and he had passed the sum of $2,850 to PW4 on 29 April 2018[^75]. PW4 explained that the reason why PW3 had paid this monies to the Accused was because PW4 was working late, and he could not meet up with the PW3 to collect the monies from PW3[^76].

36     As regards to the June 2018 rental, PW4 testified that PW3 had also paid the June rental of $1,400 to the Accused and the Accused had passed the June rental monies to him after receiving the same from PW3[\[note: 77\]](#Ftn_77). PW4 said that he had received the $1,400 from the Accused on 13 June 2018[^78]. PW4 said that he had agreed to the Accused collecting the rental monies from PW3 because he had owed the Accused $4,000 over for repair works and he had to repay this monies back to the Accused[^79]. I noted here that PW4’s reason as to what the $4,000 debt was for was again different from his earlier reasons given.

37     As for the July 2018 rental, PW4 testified that he had asked the Accused to collect the July 2018 rental from PW3 because PW4 had to work late. PW4 also testified that the Accused had deducted $700 from the rental of $1,400 to repay what PW4 had owed the Accused and the Accused had paid the balance $700 to PW4[\[note: 80\]](#Ftn_80). PW4 also said that his arrangement with the Accused was for the Accused to collect the monthly rental of $1,400 from PW3 on his behalf and the Accused would deduct $700 a month for what PW4 owed the Accused and the Accused would give the balance rental to PW4[^81].

38     As for the August 2018 rental, PW4 said that PW3 had paid the full rental to the Accused and the Accused had paid him the sum of $700 on 19 August 2018[\[note: 82\]](#Ftn_82). PW4 also said that he had agreed to this arrangement because he wanted to be sure that PW3 would pay his rental in full, and the Accused could help him monitor the payments by PW3. With that arrangement, PW4 also need not make another separate arrangement to repay the Accused[^83]. PW4 also said that the Accused had collected the August 2018 rental on his behalf as his friend and not his estate agent[^84].

39     As for the September 2018 rental, PW4 confirmed that PW3 had paid the September rental of $1,400 to the Accused and the Accused had transferred the balance to PW4 on 17 September 2018 after deducting what PW4 had owed the Accused[\[note: 85\]](#Ftn_85).

40     With regard to the October 2018 rental, PW4 testified that he did not know when PW3 had paid the October rental of $1,400 to the Accused, but the Accused had banked the balance $700 into his bank account on 19 October 2018[\[note: 86\]](#Ftn_86). PW4 also said that the Accused had collected the rental monies on his behalf as his friend[^87].

41     With regard to the November 2018 rental, PW4 confirmed that PW3 had paid the November rental of $1,400 to the Accused and the Accused had deposited the balance rental of $700 into PW4’s bank account on 19 November 2018[\[note: 88\]](#Ftn_88).

42     PW4 also said that PW3 would pay the monthly rental to the Accused every month and the Accused would help him to ensure that PW3 had paid the rental in full. After that, the Accused would deduct the amount owing and transfer the balance to PW4. I noted that PW4 had never taken any steps to check or ensure that the full rental was paid by PW3 to the Accused and he had just relied on what the Accused had told him[\[note: 89\]](#Ftn_89).

43     As for the December 2018 rental, PW4 testified that PW3 had paid the December rental to the Accused but he did not know when PW3 had paid the same to the Accused. PW4 also confirmed that the Accused had transferred the sum of $779.60 which was the balance of the December rental after deducting what was owing to the Accused to PW4’s bank account on 20 December 2018[\[note: 90\]](#Ftn_90).

44     As for the January 2019 rental, PW4 said that the Accused had collected $1,400 being the January 2019 rental from PW3 and the Accused had transferred $1000 to PW4 on 19 January 2019[\[note: 91\]](#Ftn_91). PW4 said that the Accused had deducted $400 because the Accused had helped him by a set of aircon for the Property[^92]. PW4 said that the Accused had helped him to purchase a new air-con for the Property and the Accused had arranged for PW4 to pay for the aircon by instalments of $400 a month to be deducted from the monthly rental that the Accused would collect from the tenant of the Property. PW4 also said that the air-con debt was not part of the $4000 plus that he had owed to the Accused and it was a new debt owing by PW4 to the Accused. PW4 also said that the $4000 plus was for HDB loan, conservancy charges, repairs and purchase of fridge and washing machine[^93].

45     In cross-examination, PW4 had testified to the following:

> (a)     PW4 got to know the Accused in 2007[\[note: 94\]](#Ftn_94). At that time, PW4 was jobless, and he had no furniture in his Property. The Accused had helped PW4 by buying furniture and a second-hand washing fridge and a washing machine for the Property so that PW4 could rent out the same[^95].

> (b)     The Accused had spent $3000 to 4000 plus to furnish up the Property in order for PW4 to rent out his Property[\[note: 96\]](#Ftn_96). In addition to the Accused spending money to do up the Property, PW4 had also borrowed another $1000 plus from the Accused[^97]. At that time, PW4 had owed HDB loan repayment as well as Town Council conservancy charges and PW4 had borrowed this money from the Accused to pay off part of the HDB loan so that HDB would not repossess his Property and also to pay off part of the outstanding conservancy charges so that the Town Council would not institute court proceedings against him[^98]. Part of the loan was also to pay off PW4’s outstanding phone bills[^99].

> (c)     Even though the Accused had helped PW4 to rent out the Property to PW3, the Accused had agreed not to charge PW4 any commission as the landlord’s agent and he told PW4 that he would instead claim his commission from the tenant instead[\[note: 100\]](#Ftn_100).

> (d)     PW4 also said that he had owed the Accused $4000 plus but he could not remember the exact amount owing. PW4 also had agreed to repay the $4000 plus to the Accused by way of monthly instalments of $700 each[\[note: 101\]](#Ftn_101).

> (e)     PW4 also said that he had asked the Accused to deal with PW3 on his behalf because he worked long hours and he did not have time to manage his lease of the Property with PW3[\[note: 102\]](#Ftn_102). PW4 also did not know how to use the ATM card to do bank transfers and he was unable to speak English and therefore unable to communicate with PW3[^103]. That was why PW4 had given his consent to the Accused as a friend to manage the lease of his Property with PW3[^104].

> (f)     PW4 testified that although his agreement with the Accused was for him to repay the Accused a sum of $700 a month once he had leased out the Property, he had requested the Accused to allow him to repay the $700 a month only from June 2018 onwards[\[note: 105\]](#Ftn_105).

> (g)     PW4 said that he had asked the Accused to collect the full monthly rental from PW3 because PW4 did not know how to use the ATM to transfer money. The other reason was so that PW4 need not queue up at the bank to transfer the $700 every month to the Accused. That was the reason why he had appointed the Accused to collect the rental on his behalf from PW3[\[note: 106\]](#Ftn_106).

> (h)     PW4 also testified that prior to the leasing of the Property to PW3, PW4 had also entered into various other tenancy agreements with other tenants with the Accused’s help and the Accused had also helped him with repairs to the Property or purchase new items for the Property and PW4 would also pay the Accused by allowing the Accused to deduct part of the rental collected for the other tenancies[\[note: 107\]](#Ftn_107).

> (i)     For the lease of the Property to PW3, PW4 said that he had repaid the loan of $4000 plus owing to the Accused by way of four instalment payments of $700 plus one last instalment payment of $620.40 which were all deducted from the monthly rentals[\[note: 108\]](#Ftn_108).

> (j)     As for the purchase of the air-con for the Property, PW4 testified that the Accused had contacted PW4 to inform him about the spoilt aircon in the Property and the Accused had suggested to PW4 to change the aircon as it was beyond repair. PW4 agreed to the Accused’s proposal and he instructed the Accused to go ahead to replace the aircon. The Accused then proceeded to purchase a new aircon for $2000 plus and he also forwarded the evidence of his purchase to PW4[\[note: 109\]](#Ftn_109). PW4 also said that he had repaid the Accused in full for the aircon[^110].

> (k)     PW4 also testified that since 2006 or 2007, the Accused had been managing the rental of the Property for PW4 as a friend and the Accused would take care of all his tenancies with the various tenants. The Accused would take care of all the repairs and replace spoilt appliances. The Accused would also pay for all the repairs and new appliances on behalf of PW4 first and he had never charged PW4 for all his services rendered. All PW4 was required to do was to reimburse the Accused what the Accused had paid on his behalf and that was done by way of instalment payments from the rental proceeds[\[note: 111\]](#Ftn_111).

46     During re-examination, PW4 testified that he had prepared Exhibit P2 on 3 February 2018[\[note: 112\]](#Ftn_112). Exhibit P2 was a letter by PW4 to CEA and HDB explaining PW4’s problem with a Korean tenant[^113]. PW4 said that he had written Exhibit P2 to CEA and HDB to explain what had gone wrong with the rental to the Korean tenant[^114]. PW4 also confirmed that there was a letter of intent for the rental of the Property from a prospective Korean tenant by the name of Lee Won Jae dated 1 February 2018[^115]. PW4 also confirmed that he had signed and accepted the letter of intent on 3 February 2018. However, after some pressing from the Prosecuting Officer, PW4 said that although he did prepare Exhibit P2, he could not remember the date that he had prepared Exhibit P2 and the date stated on Exhibit P2 could be wrong[^116].

47     With regard to Exhibit D1, PW4 said that he had gone to the police station to file Exhibit D1 with the Accused because he was afraid that there could be non-Mandarin speaking officers at the police station, and he had difficulty communicating in English[\[note: 117\]](#Ftn_117). PW4 had stated in paragraph 2 of Exhibit D1 that _“based on CEA regulation S644(2010)(2)(b), property agents are allowed to help landlord collect rental on their behalf”._ PW4 said that it was the Accused who had informed him about this Regulations and the Accused had told him that based on the Regulations, a property agent was allowed to help landlords collect rental on their behalf[^118].

48     I also noted that PW4 had said in court that the Accused was not acting as his salesperson in the leasing of the Property and that the Accused was merely helping him out as a friend. However, in Exhibit D1, PW4 had stated that the Accused was his estate agent and he was entitled to collect money on his behalf. When I asked PW4 as to why he had given 2 different versions of events, PW4 said that he could have thought differently when he was making his police report and that was why he had said that the Accused was his estate agent[\[note: 119\]](#Ftn_119).

49     At the close of the Prosecution’s case, I was of the view that the Prosecution had made out a prima facie case against the Accused in respect of all the proceeded charges and I thereby called on the Accused to enter his defence.

### Defence’s evidence and exhibits

50     The Accused had elected to take the stand to give his evidence in support of his defence after I had called for his defence. Other than the Accused himself, the Accused did not call any other witness to give evidence on his behalf.

51     In addition, the Accused had also tendered 3 exhibits in support of his defence[\[note: 120\]](#Ftn_120).

52     The Accused’s evidence could be summarised as follows:

#### DW1 – the Accused

53     The Accused took the position that he was not guilty of all the nine charges which were preferred by CEA against him[\[note: 121\]](#Ftn_121).

54     The Accused testified that he was PW3’s salesperson. Based on CEA guidelines, the Accused could only represent one party in the rental agreement. In the present case, the Accused was representing PW3 who was the tenant[\[note: 122\]](#Ftn_122). Under CEA guidelines, his property agent role ended after PW3 and PW4 had signed the tenancy agreement and PW4 had handed the Property to PW3. The Accused said that he was no longer PW3’s agent after PW4 had handed the Property over to PW3 and whatever that he did for PW3 or PW4 after the handover of the Property was not part of his property agent role, but he was doing it as a favour for the parties[^123]. In the present case, since PW4 had handed over the Property to PW3 on 11 May 2018, the Accused was no longer PW3’s estate agent as of that date and he should no longer be regarded as PW3’s estate agent for the rental transaction[^124]. As such, the Accused was not bound by the charges and the charges were not valid charges against him[^125].

55     As regards to the monies that the Accused had collected from PW3 on behalf of PW4, the Accused said that PW4 was his friend and he had authorised the Accused to collect the monies on his behalf. PW4 had prepared an authorisation letter dated 1 April 2018 as he wanted to repay the Accused the $4000 plus which he owed the Accused. As such, PW4 had authorised him to collect the rental from PW3 as PW4’s friend[\[note: 126\]](#Ftn_126). The Accused also said that PW4 had allowed him to manage PW4’s flat since 2007 and he was of the view that he had done nothing wrong in law[^127].

56     The Accused said that PW4 had given him a letter of authorization because the Accused had wanted to ensure that PW4 would repay him what P4 had owed to him and PW4 also wanted the Accused to help him collect rental from PW3 on his behalf. PW4 had also lost his ATM card and he could not make withdrawals from ATMs. That was why PW4 had wanted the Accused to collect the monies from PW3 and to pass him cash initially[\[note: 128\]](#Ftn_128).

57     During cross-examination, the Accused testified that:

> (a)     The Accused had been working as a salesperson for more than ten years and he was attached to C&H Properties Private Limited. The Accused was also very familiar with the duties of a real estate salesperson and with the regulations of the Council of Estate Agencies[\[note: 129\]](#Ftn_129).

> (b)     The Accused said that he was aware that for transactions involving HDB properties, salespersons were prohibited from handling transaction monies for any parties to the transactions[\[note: 130\]](#Ftn_130).

> (c)     As for PW4, the Accused had been friends with PW4 for more than ten years[\[note: 131\]](#Ftn_131). During this ten-year period, the Accused had loaned money to PW4 not as a salesperson but as PW4’s friend[^132].

> (d)     In April 2018, when PW4 was planning to rent out the Property flat, PW4 was owing money to the Accused[\[note: 133\]](#Ftn_133). PW4 had owed the Accused $4000 over for HDB loan, Town Council charges, fridge, washing machine etc[^134].

> (e)     The Accused had wanted to help PW4 rent out the Property because if PW4 successfully rented out the Property, PW4 would be able to use the rental from the Property to repay what he owed the Accused. And the Accused was more than prepared to accept instalment payments from PW4[\[note: 135\]](#Ftn_135).

> (f)     The Accused said that he had put up PW4’s Property for rent at the PropertyGuru website and he had received an enquiry from PW3 on PW4’s Property on 28 April 2018[\[note: 136\]](#Ftn_136). The Accused also said that even though he had put up PW4’s Property for rent, he was not PW4’s salesperson/agent and he was helping PW4 out as a friend. In the present case, the Accused was representing PW3 as the tenant’s salesperson/agent in this transaction[^137].

> (g)     The Accused said that when PW3 contacted him on 28 April 2018, the Accused told PW3 that he would represent PW3 and PW3 would have to pay him the agent’s commission. The Accused said that the only reason why he could not represent PW4 in the tenancy agreement was because PW4 did not have any money to pay his agent’s commission and that was the reason why the Accused had wanted to act for the tenant[\[note: 138\]](#Ftn_138).

> (h)     With regard to PW3, the Accused said that after PW3 had contacted him, he proceeded to arrange for a viewing that very night that PW3 texted the Accused[\[note: 139\]](#Ftn_139). The Accused said that PW3 had initially offered $1,400 a month without agent’s fee but the Accused told PW3 that that was not possible. The Accused testified that he would require PW3 to offer some form of commission because he needed to earn a living. After some negotiation, PW3 agreed to pay $1400 a month for the rental of the flat together with $700 as the Accused’s commission[^140].

> (i)     The Accused then met up with PW3 on 29 April 2018 to sign the tenancy agreement. PW4 was not present when the Accused met up with PW3[\[note: 141\]](#Ftn_141). When the Accused met up with PW3 on 29 April 2018, he also made PW3 sign Exhibit P18, which was an exclusive estate agency agreement[^142] for PW3 to appoint the Accused as his real estate salesperson[^143]. For this transaction, the Accused stood to receive a commission of $749 inclusive of GST[^144]. The Accused also made PW3 sign the tenancy agreement marked as Exhibit P16[^145].

> (j)     The Accused also confirmed that even though the Exhibit P16 was worded as a “Room Rental Agreement” for one room, PW4 was renting PW3 the whole Property save for one room that PW4 wished to keep in case he needed to use the room when he was working in the Serangoon area[\[note: 146\]](#Ftn_146). However, I noted in Exhibit P17, which was the inventory list of all the items in the said flat that the inventory list included items in the whole Property including the bedroom that PW4 was supposed to be using[^147].

> (k)     The Accused also confirmed that he had given his bank account number to PW3[\[note: 148\]](#Ftn_148). The Accused said that he had wanted PW3 to meet up with PW4 after they had signed the tenancy agreement on 29 April 2018 but PW4 was only available to meet up around 12 am. PW3 did not want to meet up with PW4 at so late an hour and he decided to transfer the rental deposit and advance rental to the Accused for the Accused to hand over to PW4[^149]. The Accused also said that PW4 had lost his ATM card at that point of time. So the Accused could not transfer the monies to PW4 as PW4 would not be able to access the monies. Therefore, the Accused had to pass cash to PW4[^150].

> (l)     The Accused said that PW4 had authorised him to manage the Property and collect the rental as a friend but not as an agent[\[note: 151\]](#Ftn_151).

> (m)     PW3 had transferred the sum of $2,000 to the Accused’s account on 29 April 2018[\[note: 152\]](#Ftn_152). This monies were banked into the Accused’s DBS account XXX[^153]. The Accused said that PW4 had owed him monies and he was entitled to be reimbursed from the rental that he had collected from PW3 for PW4[^154]. However, for the rental deposit and the first month advance rental, PW4 requested that the Accused not to deduct any monies and to forward the full sum to PW4[^155]. So, the Accused forwarded the full $2,000 to PW4[^156]. In addition to the $2,000, the Accused also handed $850 of his own monies, totalling $2,850 to PW4[^157].

> (n)     The Accused also said that he had informed PW3 when he met PW3 on 29 April 2018 that PW3 would need to pay the rental for the next few months to the Accused[\[note: 158\]](#Ftn_158). The Accused said that although the instruction was from PW4, PW4 was not present when the Accused met up with PW3 on 29 April 2018 and the Accused was the one who had informed PW3 about the mode of payment on 29 April 2018[^159].

> (o)     The Accused also confirmed that he had informed PW3 that PW3 had to make the following payments upon the signing of the tenancy agreement “_Deposit $1400, advance 1400, agent fee 749 total 3549_”[\[note: 160\]](#Ftn_160). PW3 did text the Accused and told him that he had transferred $2000 on 29 April 2018[^161]. This $2000 was paid to the Accused’s DBS account[^162]. After that, the Accused told PW3 that he still had to pay the balance of $1549[^163].

> (p)     The Accused said that after the payment of the $2,000, PW3 paid him a sum of $1,672.80 on 6 May 2018[\[note: 164\]](#Ftn_164). This payment of $1,672.80 included the balance sum of $1,549 plus $50 for early move in and $73.80 for unpaid utility fees[^165]. The Accused said that although his commission was only paid on 6 May 2018, his company had issued an official receipt for his commission on 30 April 2018[^166]. The Accused said that he had paid his own commission to his company first because the deal had been completed and he just wanted to close the matter and move on[^167].

> (q)     As for the June 2018 rental, PW3 banked a sum of $1410 into the Accused’s DBS account on 19 June 2018[\[note: 168\]](#Ftn_168). The $1,410 consisted of $1,400 for the June rental plus $10 for the HDB submission fee[^169]. The Accused passed $1,400 in cash to PW4 after receiving the same from PW3[^170]. The Accused also confirmed that he had received the $1400 on behalf of PW4 from PW3[^171].

> (r)     With regard to the July 2018 rental, PW3 had transferred the sum of $1,400 into the Accused’s DBS account on 20 July 2018[\[note: 172\]](#Ftn_172). The Accused then proceeded to transfer $700 to PW4’s bank account[^173].

> (s)     On 17 August 2018, the Accused said that he had relayed PW4’s instruction to PW3 for rental payment and he had sent PW3 the following message “_Hi, Rowell, landlord asked if you can transfer him today, as he needs to pay his instalment today_”[\[note: 174\]](#Ftn_174). PW3 then replied to the Accused asking him how to make the transfer and the Accused told PW3 to make the transfer to the Accused and the Accused would then transfer the same to PW4[^175]. PW3, after receiving the Accused’s instruction, proceeded to make the bank transfer into the Accused’s bank account. PW3 also sent the Accused a screenshot of the bank transfer[^176]. The Accused then proceeded to forward $700 to PW4 by electronic transfer[^177] and he kept $700 as reimbursement from PW4 to him[^178].

> (t)     As for the September 2018 rental, the Accused also corresponded with PW3 on the September rental payment[\[note: 179\]](#Ftn_179). PW3 then proceeded to bank the payment of $1,400 into the Accused’s bank account on 17 September 2018[^180]. The Accused then kept $700 and transferred $700 to PW4[^181].

> (u)     For the October 2018 rental, the Accused said that he had received a reminder call from PW4 asking him to remind PW3 to pay his October rental. The Accused then proceeded to text PW3 on the same[\[note: 182\]](#Ftn_182). PW3 then proceeded to pay the $1,400 into the Accused’s bank account on 19 October 2018. After the Accused had received the $1400 from PW3, he proceeded to retain $700 for himself and he paid the balance of $700 to PW4[^183].

> (v)     As for the November 2018 rental, the Accused said that he had received the payment of $1,400 from PW43 on 19 November 2018[\[note: 184\]](#Ftn_184). The Accused then proceeded to transfer the sum of $700 to PW4 on the same day and he retained $700 for himself as repayment from PW4[^185].

> (w)     As for the December 2018 rental, PW3 transferred the sum of $1,300 into the Accused’s account on 19 December 2018[\[note: 186\]](#Ftn_186). According to the Accused, there was some air conditioning works which were done to the Property which involved piping and some hacking. The works cost $185 but the Accused did not have sufficient funds on him, and he had to borrow $100 from PW3 to pay the aircon people who were onsite. That was why PW3 only had to transfer the sum of $1300 to his bank account instead of $1,400[^187]. The Accused also confirmed that Exhibit P24 was the sales order for the purchase of the aircon for the Property[^188]. The Accused then deducted the sum of $620.40 which was the balance sum owing by PW4 to him (i.e., from the $4,120.60) and he transferred the sum of $779.60 to PW4’s bank account after deducting what was owed to him by PW4[^189].

> (x)     The Accused also said that PW4 had owed him $4,120.60 but he had written the wrong amount of $4,120.40 in Exhibit D3[\[note: 190\]](#Ftn_190).

> (y)     As for the January 2019 rental, the Accused said that he had received the January 2019 rental from PW3 on 19 January 2019 and he had transferred the sum of $1,000 to PW4’s account on 20 January 2019[\[note: 191\]](#Ftn_191). The Accused had retained a sum of $400 as reimbursement for the installation of the aircon unit which he had paid on behalf of PW4[^192],

> (z)     The Accused also acknowledged that whilst it was stated in the tenancy agreement (i.e., Exhibit P16) that PW3 was supposed to pay the monthly rental from June 2018 to January 2019 into PW4’s account, PW3 did not make any payments directly to PW4 during this period. This was because PW4 had given instruction for all the rental to be paid to the Accused’s bank account[\[note: 193\]](#Ftn_193).

> (aa)     The Accused also confirmed that PW3 had paid the monthly rentals from September 2018 to January 2019 by internet bank transfer into the Accused’s bank account and the Accused had made the payments to PW4 by way of bank internet transfers[\[note: 194\]](#Ftn_194). The Accused also said that PW3 had refused to pay the monthly rental to PW4 directly[^195].

> (bb)     The Accused also said that PW4 had agreed to this arrangement, and he had asked the Accused to collect the rentals on his behalf because PW4 did not know how to use internet bank transfer functions and he also did not know how to use his ATM card to transfer money[\[note: 196\]](#Ftn_196).

## My findings and decision

### The law and elements of the charge

58     It was provided under Regulation 7 of the Regulations that:

> “_7.— (1) No estate agent or salesperson shall hold or handle any money for or on behalf of any party in relation to any of the following property transactions:_

>> (_a_)     _the sale or purchase of any property situated in Singapore; and_

>> (_b_)     _the lease of HDB property_

> _(2) Paragraph (1) shall not prevent any estate agent or salesperson from –_

>> (_a_)     _delivering on behalf of any party a crossed account payee cheque or cashier’s order drawn in favour of another party to the transaction; or_

>> (_b_)     _receiving such remuneration or reimbursement in relation to the management, repair or renovation of the property as the estate agent or salesperson may be entitled to under a written contract or authorisation.”_

59     Looking at Regulation 7 of the Regulations, a plain and ordinary reading of Regulations 7(1) and 7(2) would suggest that if an estate agent/salesperson was acting for either the landlord or the tenant in a lease transaction relating to a HDB property, the said estate agent/salesperson would not be allowed to hold or handle any monies relating to that transaction and the only exception would be either (a) whereby the monies were given to the estate agent/salesperson in the form of a crossed cheque or cashier’s order; or (ii) if the monies handled by the estate agent/salesperson was for management, repair or renovation of the property which the estate agent/salesperson was entitled to under a written contract or authorisation.

60     In the present case, the Accused faced a total of nine similar charges under section 7(1)(b) of the Regulations for handling monies on behalf of PW4 in relation to the lease of the Property by PW4 to PW3.

61     In order for the Prosecution to secure a conviction against the Accused of the nine charges, the Prosecution would need to prove the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt:

> (a)     That there was a lease of the Property by PW4 to PW3.

> (b)     That the Accused had acted as the salesperson for one of the parties to the lease. In the present case, both parties had agreed that the Accused was acting for PW3 as the tenant’s agent on the lease transaction.

> (c)     That the Accused had the intention of holding or handling monies on behalf of any of the parties relating to the lease transaction and he did hold or handled the monies accordingly.

### Undisputed facts

62     In the present case, I would agree with the Prosecution[\[note: 197\]](#Ftn_197) that the material facts in the present case were largely undisputed:

> (a)     The Accused and PW4 had known each other for more than ten years and PW4 knew that the Accused was working as a salesperson for an estate agent.

> (b)     PW4 had borrowed money from the Accused on a number of occasions and before the Accused rented out the Property to PW3 on PW4’s behalf, PW4 was indebted to the Accused in the sum of $4,120.40.

> (c)     PW4 had asked the Accused to rent out the Property and the Accused had advertised the Property for rental at the PropertyGuru property listing website.

> (d)     PW3 had responded to the Accused’s advertisement to rent the Property from PW4.

> (e)     The Accused knew that PW4 could not afford to pay his agent’s commission if he were to act for PW4 in the lease rental, so he decided to ask PW3 to pay his estate agent’s commission. In this regard, the Accused went on to sign an Exclusive Estate Agency Agreement with PW3 (Exhibit P18) on 29 April 2018 so that he could become PW3’s agent in the said transaction and collect commission from PW3. The Accused’s commission for PW3’s lease of the Property was $700.00 (excluding GST).

> (f)     The Accused also entered into an agreement with PW4 whereby PW4 was supposed to repay him the $4,120.40 which PW4 had owed the Accused by way of monthly instalment payments of $700.00 which was to be taken from monthly rental paid by PW3 for the Property.

> (g)     PW3 and PW4 had signed a tenancy agreement for PW3 to lease the property on 29 April 2018 (Exhibit P16). The signing of the tenancy agreement was facilitated by the Accused and both PW3 and PW4 did not meet up with each other in order to sign the tenancy agreement. It was also clear from the evidence that PW3 and PW4 had never contacted each other directly and it was always the Accused who was dealing directly with PW3.

> (h)     It was clearly stated in the tenancy agreement (Exhibit P16) that PW3 was supposed to pay the monthly rental of $1,400.00 for the Property to PW4’s POSB account no. XXX. It was also a term of the tenancy agreement that the lease would be for a period of one year commencing from 19 May 2018.

> (i)     When the tenancy agreement was signed on 29 April 2018, PW3 was supposed to pay PW4 a rental deposit equivalent to one month’s rental plus one month advance rental totalling $2,800. PW3 was also supposed to pay the Accused $749.00 being the Accused’s commission plus GST.

> (j)     Instead of asking PW3 to issue a cheque for the $2,800 in favour of PW4 or banking the monies into PW4’s bank account, the Accused had instructed PW3 to pay all the monies (including the Accused’s estate agent’s commission) into the Accused’s personal DBS bank account no. XXX (See Exhibit P15).

> (k)     PW3 transferred a sum of $2,000 into the Accused’s DBS account on 29 April 2018 and the Accused met up with PW4 later that night and handed $2,850 to PW4 in cash. PW3 paid the rest of the monies to the Accused on 6 May 2018.

> (l)     Of the sum of $2,000 that the PW3 had transferred to the Accused account, I noted that in relation to the DSC 900057-202, the Prosecution had proceeded to charge the Accused with handling $1,251 belonging to PW4 as they were of the view that $749 constituted the agent’s commission payable by PW3 to the Accused and the Accused’s company C&H Properties Pte Ltd had issued an official receipt for $749 to PW3 which was dated 30 April 2018 acknowledging the receipt of the payment[\[note: 198\]](#Ftn_198).

63     As for the monthly rental for the Property, PW3 had asked the Accused as to which account he should transfer the payment for the June 2018 rental into and the Accused had sent him a WhatsApp on 19 June 2018 and had requested him to make the payment into any of the following accounts[\[note: 199\]](#Ftn_199):

> (a)     DBS Saving Plus XXX

> (b)     OCBC Current XXX

> (c)     UOB Saving XXX

> It was also not disputed that all the above 3 bank accounts belonged to the Accused.

64     As for the monthly rental payable for the Property, PW3 had paid the following sums to the Accused on the following dates:

> (a)     PW3 had paid the sum of $1,410.00 (being $1,400.00 for the rental payment for June 2018 and $10.00 for the application to HDB to rent the Property) into the Accused’s DBS account by way of electronic bank transfer on 19 June 2018. The Accused did not retain any of this money and he handed the full sum of $1,400.00 in cash to PW4.

> (b)     As for the July 2018 rental payment, PW3 had banked $1,400.00 into the Accused’s DBS account by way of electronic bank transfer, and he had sent the evidence of payment to the Accused by WhatsApp on 20 July 2018. The Accused kept $700.00 as PW4’s partial repayment for his debts and he transferred $700.00 by way of electronic bank transfer into PW4’s POSB account no. XXX.

> (c)     As for the August 2018 rental payment, PW3 paid $1,400.00 to the Accused’s DBS account and he had sent the evidence of payment to the Accused by WhatsApp on 19 August 2018. The Accused then proceeded to transfer $700.00 to PW4’s bank account by way of electronic bank transfer and he kept the remaining $700.00 as part of PW4’s repayment of his debt owing to the Accused.

> (d)     As for the September 2018 rental payment, the Accused had WhatsApp PW3 on 17 September 2018 and informed PW3 that the PW4 had requested PW3 to make the payment before PW4 went overseas the following day. PW3 then asked the Accused as to how he was supposed to pay the rental money and the Accused told PW3 to pay the monies to the Accused and the Accused would transfer the money to PW4. PW3 then proceeded to transfer the $1,400.00 from his bank account to the Accused’s DBS account by way of electronic bank transfer. After receiving the payment from PW3, the Accused kept $700 and proceeded to pay remaining $700.00 to PW4 by way of electronic bank transfer into PW4’s bank account.

> (e)     As for the October 2018 rental payment, the Accused had WhatsApp PW3 on 19 October 2018 and had reminded him to pay the October rental payment. PW3 then asked the Accused if the payment was to be transferred to the Accused’s account and the Accused confirmed the same. PW3 then proceeded to transfer the $1,400.00 from his bank account to the Accused’s DBS account on 19 October 2018. After PW3 had paid the $1,400.00 to the Accused, he proceeded to WhatsApp the evidence of payment to the Accused. The Accused then transferred $700.00 from his bank account to PW4’s bank account and he retained the balance $700.00 as part of PW4’s repayment of debt.

> (f)     I noted PW3’s testimony that the Accused had arranged for him to pay the monthly rental from May to October 2018 to the Accused because PW4 had owed the Accused money. However, PW3 continued to pay the monthly rental to the Accused after October 2018 because the Accused had instructed him to continue with the arrangement. I also noted that the Accused had not disputed or challenged PW3’s evidence on this point.

> (g)     As for the November 2018 rental payment, PW3 transferred the $1,400.00 from his bank account to the Accused’s bank account on 19 November 2018. The Accused then proceeded to transfer $700.00 to PW4’s bank account by way of electronic bank transfer and he kept the remaining $700.00 as PW4’s repayment of debts.

> (h)     As for the December 2018 rental payment, the Accused had helped PW4 to install a new air-conditioner in the Property sometime in November 2018. However, the Accused did not have enough money to pay for the replacement aircon bracket and PW3 had paid the aircon technician $100 for the replacement bracket on behalf of the Accused. PW3 therefore deducted $100 from the December rental payment and he paid $1,300.00 into the Accused’s DBS account on 19 December 2018. The Accused transferred $779.60 by way of electronic bank transfer into PW4’s account on 20 December 2018 and he retained the sum of $620.40 as the balance payment of the debt of $4,120.40.

> (i)     It was clear from the evidence that the Accused had retained the sum of $700 of the monthly rentals from June 2018 till November 2018 and he had retained the sum of $620.40 from the December monthly rental as repayment of PW4’s debt of $4,120,40.

> (j)     As for the January 2019 rental payment, PW3 had transferred $1,400 from his bank account to the Accused’s DBS bank account on 19 January 2019. By this time, the Accused had helped PW4 to purchase and install a new air-conditioner for the Property and the cost of the new air-conditioner was $2,179.00. The Accused and PW4 had also agreed for PW4 to repay the $2,179 by way of instalments of $400 a month. As such, the Accused transferred a sum of $1,000.00 to PW4 by way of electronic bank transfer into PW4’s bank account and he retained a sum of $400 as partial repayment of the new debt of $2,179 owing by PW4 to the Accused.

> (k)     It was also not disputed that throughout the entire period from April 2018 till January 2019, PW3 had never paid any monthly rental directly to PW4 for the Property. All the payments during this period were paid by PW3 to the Accused on behalf of PW4. PW3 had made all the payments by way of bank transfers to the Accused’s bank account.

### Issues before the Court

65     In the present case, I was of the view that the issues that needed to be determined for the present case were as follows:

> (a)     Whether the Accused was a “salesperson” under Regulation 7(1)(b) of the Regulations.

> (b)     Whether all the monies that were collected by the Accused from PW3 on behalf of PW4 on all the occasions as stated in the nine charges were “transaction monies” in relation to the lease of the Property under Regulation 7(1)(b) of the Regulations and whether the Accused was PW3’s salesperson when he was collecting the monthly rental from PW3 on behalf of PW4.

> (c)     Whether the consent or authorisation by PW4 to the Accused to help him collect the monies from PW3 could constitute a defence under Regulation 7(2) of the Regulations.

> (d)     As regards to $4,120.40 which was owing by PW4 to the Accused which the Accused had deducted from the monies which he had collected from PW3, whether these monies could be regarded as monies due by PW4 to the Accused for the purposes of “managing, repairing or renovating” the Property on behalf of PW4 under Regulation 7(2) of the Regulations. In this regard, I would also need to determine if Regulation 7(2) was applicable to the Accused in the present case.

#### Whether the Accused was an “estate agent” under Regulation 7(1)(b) of the Regulations.

66     Regulation 7(1)(b) of the Regulations provided that:

> “no estate agent or salesperson shall hold or handle any money for or on behalf of any party in relation to any of the property transactions: … the lease of HDB property.”

67     In the present case, it was not disputed that although the Accused was the one who had advertised the rental of PW4’s Property in the PropertyGuru website, he did not collect any commission from PW4 for the rental of the Property but instead, the Accused had signed an Exclusive Estate Agency Agreement with PW3 on 29 April 2018[\[note: 200\]](#Ftn_200) whereby PW3 had appointed the Accused as his salesperson for the purposes leasing the Property from PW4. It was also clear from the evidence that PW3 had paid the Accused a sum of $700 plus GST as the Accused’s commission for the leasing of the Property pursuant to the Exclusive Estate Agency Agreement with PW3.

68     As such, it was clear to me that the Accused was clearly PW3’s salesperson in relation to the PW4’s lease of the Property to PW3.

#### Whether all the monies collected by the Accused from PW3 on behalf of PW4 on all the occasions as stated in the nine charges were transaction monies in relation to the lease of the Property under Regulation 7(1)(b) of the Regulations and was the Accused PW3’s estate agent when he was collecting the monthly rental from PW3 on behalf of PW4

##### (i)    Prosecution’s case

69     In the present case, the Prosecution had submitted that monies that the Accused had collected from PW4 on behalf of PW9 on the nine different occasions as stated in the nine charges against the Accused were “transaction monies” under Regulation 7(1)(b) of the Regulations.

70     The Accused had collected monies from PW3 on the following occasions:

> (a)     For the 1st Charge DCS 900057-2020 – a sum of $2,000 as part payment of the rental deposit, advance rental and the Accused’s commission on 29 April 2018. The Accused had given the $2,000 to PW4 on the same day.

> (b)     For the 2nd Charge DCS 900058-2020 – a sum of $1,410 being $1,400 for the June 2018 rental and $10 reimbursement to the Accused for fees payable to HDB for the application to rent out bedrooms in the Property on 19 June 2018. The Accused had given the sum of $1,400 to PW4 on the same day.

> (c)     For the 3rd Charge DCS 900059-2020 – a sum of $1,400 being the July 2018 rental on 20 July 2018. The Accused forwarded a sum of $700 to PW4 on the same day.

> (d)     For the 4th Charge DCS 900060-2020 – a sum of $1,400 on 19 August 2018. The Accused forwarded $700 to PW4 on the same day.

> (e)     For the 5th Charge DCS 900061-2020 – a sum of $1,400 on 17 September 2018. The Accused forwarded $700 to PW4 on the same day.

> (f)     For the 6th Charge DCS 900062-2020 – a sum of $1,400 on 19 October 2018. The Accused forwarded $700 to PW4 on the same day.

> (g)     For the 7th Charge DCS 900063-2020 – a sum of $1,400 on 19 November 2018. The Accused forwarded $700 to PW4 on the same day.

> (h)     For the 8th Charge DCS 900064-2020 – a sum of $1,300 on 19 December 2018. The Accused forwarded $779.60 to PW4 on 20 December 2018.

> (i)     For the 9th Charge DCS 00065-2020 – a sum of $1,400 on 19 January 2018. The Accused forwarded $1,000 to PW4 on the same day.

##### (ii)    Accused’s defence

71     As for the Accused, although he did not file any Closing Submissions, I would agree with the Prosecution that it was clear from the Accused’s evidence and the manner in which he had cross-examined the Prosecution’s witnesses that the Accused was alluding to the following:

> (a)      With regard to the 2nd to the 9th Charges, that Regulation 7(1)(b) of the Regulations did not apply to him and the 2nd to the 9th Charges were therefore invalid. The Accused’s position was that he was PW3’s salesperson for the purposes of the leasing of the Property but his role as salesperson had ended immediately after parties had signed the tenancy agreement and he had handed over the keys to the Property to the PW3. And as the Accused had handed the keys to the Property to PW3 on 11 May 2018, he was no longer PW3’s estate agent in relation to the lease of the Property.

> (b)     The Accused also argued that when he was collecting the monthly rental on behalf of PW4 as per the 2nd to the 9th Charges, he was collecting the same as PW4’s friend and he was no longer PW3’s salesperson. As the Accused was no longer PW3’s salesperson after 11 May 2018, the monthly rental that he had collected could not be regarded as “transaction monies” and Regulation 7(1)(b) was not applicable to him in relation to the 2nd to the 9th Charges.

> (c)     In addition, the Accused had argued that he was collecting the monthly rental for PW4 with PW4’s consent and authorisation. And since Regulation 7(1)(b) was not applicable to him, the Accused had done nothing wrong or illegal.

> (d)      With regard to the 1st Charge, I noted that the Accused did not dispute the fact that he was PW3’s salesperson agent at the point of time when he collected the $2,000 from PW3 to hand over to PW4 on 29 April 2018. However, the Accused had argued that (i) he had express consent/authorisation of PW4 to collect the $2,000 and (ii) PW4 had owed him $4,120.40 in relation to the management, repair or renovation of the Property and he is entitled to such reimbursement as authorised by PW4. As such, it would seem that the Accused was submitting that there is a defence of consent which could be applied to Regulation 7 of the Regulations and that he was entitled to the defence under Regulation 7(2).

> (e)      With regard to the 3rd to the 9th Charges, it would seem to me that the Accused was making an alternative argument that since he had an agreement with PW4 to repay the sum of $4,120.40 which PW4 was owing to him by monthly instalments to be deducted from the monthly rental that he had collected on behalf of PW4 from PW3 and that he might be entitled to deduct these monies under Regulation 7(2) of the Regulations.

72     It was clear from the positions taken by both sides that there was a dispute between parties as to how they had interpreted of Regulation 7.

73     It was clear to me that the Accused’s position was that the monies for the lease transaction in the present case must refer to only monies handled by the Accused before the lease transaction was concluded (i.e., 11 May 2018). The Accused was of the view that the lease transaction would have concluded when the tenancy agreement was signed and the keys to the Property handed over to PW3. And any monies handled by the Accused which was after the conclusion of the lease transaction could not be taken as transaction monies under Regulation 7(1)(b). As such, the transaction monies in the present case would only include the rental deposit and the advance rental but it should not include the monthly rental to be paid after the tenancy agreement had been signed and possession of the Property given to PW3.

74     Whereas the Prosecution’s position[\[note: 201\]](#Ftn_201) was the transaction in question in the present case was the lease of the Property. As such, “monies” relating to the lease of the Property under Regulation 7 should not only include the rental deposits and advance rentals which were usually paid before the signing of the tenancy agreement and the handing over possession of the Property, “monies” should also include the monthly rental for the period of tenancy as these payments were also “monies” contemplated by parties to the lease transaction.

75     Regulation 7(1)(b) of the Regulations provided that “no salesperson shall hold or handle any money for and on behalf of any party in relation to the lease of HDB property”.

76     In the present case, it was clear that the Property in question was a HDB property and the Accused was acting as PW3’s agent in the lease of the HDB property.

77     In view of the dispute between the parties, I would need to determine if the term “money relating to the lease of the Property” was money handled by the Accused only at the point of time where the tenancy agreement was signed and possession of the Property given to PW3 (ie only the rental deposit and advance payment) or it should refer to any monies connected with any transaction relating to the lease of the Property which would include all monies to be paid by PW3 to PW4 including the rental deposit, advance payment as well as all the monthly rental payable throughout the entire period of the lease.

##### (iii)    The proper approach to statutory interpretation was the purposive approach

78     It is trite law that the correct approach when interpreting a statutory provision is to interpret it purposively.

79     The approach to purposive interpretation under section 9A of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) was canvassed by the Court of Appeal in _Attorney-General v Ting Choon Meng and another appeal_ \[2017\] SGCA 06 (“_Ting Choon Meng_”). In _Ting Choon Meng_, Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon laid out a three-step framework:

> _“59_      _It follows from this that the court’s task when undertaking a purposive interpretation of a legislative text should begin with three steps:_

>> (_a_)     _first_, **_ascertaining the possible interpretations of the text, as it has been enacted._** _This however should never be done by examining the provision in question in isolation. Rather, it should be undertaken having due regard to the context of that text within the written law as a whole;_

>> (_b_)     _second_, **_ascertaining the legislative purpose or object of the statute._** _This may be discerned from the language used in the enactment; but as I demonstrate below, it can also be discerned by resorting to extraneous material in certain circumstances. In this regard, the court should_ **_principally consider the general legislative purpose of the enactment by reference to any mischief that Parliament was seeking to address by it. In addition, the court should be mindful of the possibility that the specific provision that is being interpreted may have been enacted by reason of some specific mischief or object that may be distinct from, but not inconsistent with, the general legislative purpose underlying the written law as a whole._** _I elaborate on this in the following two paragraphs; and_

>> (c)     _third_, **_comparing the possible interpretations of the text against the purposes or objects of the statute._** _Where the purpose of the provision in question as discerned from the language used in the enactment clearly supports one interpretation_, **_reference to extraneous materials may be had for a limited function – to confirm but not to alter the ordinary meaning of the provision as purposively ascertained; but I elaborate on this in the following section.”_**

> \[emphasis mine in **bold**\]

80     This three-step framework was subsequently affirmed by the Court of Appeal in _Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 50</span> (“_Tan Cheng Bock”)_ at \[37\] to \[54\].

81     As such, in order for me to determine the meaning of “money relating to the lease of the Property”, I would need to do the following:

> (a)     First, I would first need to ascertain the possible interpretation of “money relating to the lease of the Property” under the Regulation 7(1)(b).

> (b)     Second, I would need to ascertain the legislative purpose or object of the Regulation 7(1)(b). I would need to consider the general legislative purpose of the enactment by reference to any mischief that Parliament was seeking to address by it. In addition, I would need to be mindful of the possibility that Regulation 7(1)(b) might have been enacted to address some specific mischief that might have been distinct from, but not inconsistent with, the general legislative purpose underlying the Regulations as a whole.

> (c)     Third, I would need to compare the possible interpretations of “money relating to the lease of the Property” against the purpose or object of Regulation 7(1)(b). For that, I would be allowed to refer to extraneous materials such as the Hansard to confirm but not to alter the ordinary meaning of the provision as purposively ascertained.

> (d)     I also noted that I could only refer to extraneous material such as Parliamentary debates in three situations[\[note: 202\]](#Ftn_202):

>> (i)       If the ordinary meaning of “money relating to the lease of the Property” was clear, extraneous material could only be used to confirm the ordinary meanings but not to alter them.

>> (ii)       If the term “money relating to the lease of the Property” was ambiguous or obscure on the face, extraneous material could be used to ascertain the meanings of “money relating to the lease of the Property”.

>> (iii)       If the ordinary meaning of “money relating to the lease of the Property” (taking into account its context in the Regulations and the purpose or object underlying the Regulations) led to a result which was manifestly absurd or unreasonable, extraneous material could be used to ascertain the meaning of “money relating to the lease of the Property”.

##### (iv)    Applying the purposive approach to the definition of “money relating to the lease of the Property”

Definition of “money” in Regulation 7

82     I noted that there was no definition of the term “money” as defined within Regulation 7(1) of the Regulations. As such, in the present case, I would need to determine whether the rental deposit, advance rental and the monthly rental which was paid by PW3 to the Accused on behalf of PW4 could be regarded as “money” in relation to the leasing of the Property.

83     In applying the three-step framework in _Ting Choon Meng_, I was of the view that the word “money” in Regulation 7(1)(b) of the Regulations could be interpreted to include all monies which were connected to the leasing of the Property and it would cover payments such as rental deposits, advance rental as well as the monthly rental payable by PW3.

##### i.    Step one of the three-step framework

84     Step one of the analysis was to find the plain and ordinary meaning of “money”. In the present case I noted that the word “money” was defined in a number of dictionaries as follows:

> (a)     In the Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary of Current English, “money” was defined as “what you earn by working or selling things, and use to buy things.

> (b)     In the Cambridge Dictionary, “money” was defined as “coins or notes that are used to buy things, or an amount of these that a person has”.

> (c)     In the Merriam Webster Dictionary, “money” was defined as “something (such as coins or bills) used in a way to pay for goods and services and to pay people for their work”.

85     As such, the ordinary meaning of “money” in relation to the leasing of the Property between PW4 and PW3 would include all monies which would be exchanged between PW3 and PW4 for the leasing of the Property and it should include all payments by PW3 to PW4 including and not limited to rental deposit, advance rental and monthly rentals.

##### ii.    Step two of the three-step framework

86     I would agree with the Prosecution[\[note: 203\]](#Ftn_203) that the legislative purposes of the Act and the Regulations were as explained in the Second Reading of the Estate Agents Bill, by then-Minister for National Development Mr Mah Bow Tan that the Act was enacted to _“put in place a robust legislative and regulatory framework to better protect consumer interest and raise the professionalism of the industry”_[^204]. During the Second Reading, reference was also made to envisioned subsidiary legislation which would _“stipulate rules such as those banning dual representation by salespersons…”_[^205]. This subsidiary legislation eventually came into force as the Regulations.

87     I agreed with the Prosecution that the purpose of the Regulations was to prescribe the professional standards expected of estate agents and salespersons, as well as to clearly delineate the types of conduct (in addition to offence provisions already found in the parent Act) which would attract criminal sanctions. The key purpose served by the Act was that of consumer protection was much of the Parliamentary debate on the Estate Agents Bill was centred on errant behaviour of salespersons in the pre-CEA era.

88     I also agreed with the Prosecution that the purpose and aim of Regulation 7 was clear in that it was to prohibit the handling of transaction monies by estate agents and salespersons in order to reduce the risk of consumers on either side of a transaction, especially where the mode of payment is in a manner which may be easily converted by errant estate agents or salespersons for their own use (e.g., in cash or bearer cheque). The intent of this provision was confirmed by reference to the exception stipulated in Regulation 7(2)(a) where estate agents and salespersons were only allowed to handle crossed account payee cheques or cashier’s orders

##### iii.    Step three of the three-step framework

89     In the present case, it was clear to me that definition of “money” in relation to a lease of a HDB property under Regulation 7(1)(b) must include the monthly rentals payable by PW3 to PW4 and it should not just include the rental deposit and the advance rental. If “money” in Regulation 7(1)(b) was to be interpreted to include only the rental deposit and advance rental, then Regulation 7(1)(b) would have failed to mitigate the main risk that it was intended to mitigate, namely unsuspecting consumers being exposed to a heightened risk of monetary loss when they place their monies into the hands of an intermediary (an estate agent or salesperson) when discharging their contractual obligations of making payment.

90     I also noted that Regulation 7(2) had allowed for two situations whereby an estate agent/salesperson was allowed to hold onto monies for or on behalf of any party in relation to the lease of a HDB property. It was clear from Regulation 7(2) that Regulation 7(1) did not prevent/prohibit any estate agent/salesperson from:

> (a)     delivering on behalf of any party a crossed account cheque or cashier’s order in favour of the other party to the transaction; or

> (b)     receiving such remuneration or reimbursement in relation to the management, repair or renovation of the HDB property that the estate agent may be entitled to under a written contract or authorisation.

91     Given the nature of a crossed account cheque or cashier’s order, it was easy to understand why our legislators had allowed an estate agent/salesperson to handle such modes of payments on behalf of parties to a HDB lease transaction. There was no way an errant estate agent/salesperson would be able to covet such payments to his own use as the names of the payee had been clearly spelt out in such instruments and they were non transferrable as opposed to cash and uncrossed cheques.

92     Given that the purpose of Regulation 7 was to protect unsuspecting consumers being exposed to a heightened risk of monetary loss when they place their monies into the hands of an intermediary (an estate agent or salesperson) when discharging their obligation, and looking at the nature of the 2 exceptions permissible under Regulation 7(2), if we are to interpret the term “money” to include only advance rental and rental deposit and not to include monthly rental payable by the tenant to the landlord, that would have been clearly against the purpose for such Regulation 7 was enacted.

93     As such, I was of the view that the term “money” in Regulation 7(1) should cover rental deposits, advance rental as well as all monthly rental payable throughout the entire period of the HDB lease.

At which point of time should we determine “transaction money” in regulation 7(1)

94     In the present case, there was a dispute between parties as to what were the transaction monies that were applicable to the Accused for the purposes of Regulation 7(1).

95     The Accused’s position was that transaction monies that he had handled on behalf of the parties pertaining to the lease of the Property was only the $2,000 which he had taken from PW3 to be paid to PW4 on 29 April 2018. The Accused’s position was that his role as salesperson for PW3 had ended the moment he had gotten parties to sign the tenancy agreement and handed over the keys to the Property to PW3 on 11 May 2018. As such, any monies which he had handled after 11 May 2018 could not be regarded transaction monies relating to the lease of the Property and therefore the 2nd to the 9th Charge were invalid in law. The Accused’s contention was that he was no longer PW3’s salesperson and he was just PW4’s friend when he was collecting the monthly rental for June 2018 onwards for PW4 and therefore Regulation 7(1)(b) was not applicable to him.

96     The Accused’s interpretation was that transaction monies only referred to monies that were required to be paid by PW3 to PW4 when the Accused was PW3’s estate agent/salesperson. In the present case, the Accused’s position was that his role in the transaction was limited to the signing of the tenancy agreement and the handing over of possession of the Property (i.e., handling over the keys to the Property).

97     The Prosecution had point out that based on the Accused’s interpretation of the term “transaction monies” in Regulation 7(1)(b)[\[note: 206\]](#Ftn_206), _“the line is drawn at the time of execution of the relevant contract i.e. conclusion of the transaction; monies which are handled ex post facto would not contravene Regulation 7(1)(b) even though the obligation, for which one party bound himself to make payment of certain monies after the conclusion of the transaction (such as monthly rentals or even progress payments for properties under development in the case of a sale transaction), was reached at the exact same point in time that payment obligations vis-à-vis security deposit and advance rental monies arose”._

98     The Prosecution’s position was that so long as the nature of the monies were so closely connected with the lease of the Property, any such money should be regarded as transaction monies for the purposes of Regulation 7(1)(b). In this regard, the Prosecution was of the view that since the monthly rental were contemplated by the parties when entering into a lease agreement for the HDB property, even if such payments were due at a later date, such payments if handled by the Accused would constitute transaction monies under Regulation 7(10(b)[\[note: 207\]](#Ftn_207). According to the Prosecution[^208], “_the nature of monies that would be caught under Regulation 7(1)(b) if handled by an estate agent or salesperson was that which were so closely-connected to or arising out of the transaction that parties have entered into such that they could be said to have been paid or payable out of other circumstances. Lease transactions in Singapore were governed by contracts. At the point of parties entering into a contractual relationship to reduce the terms and conditions of their transaction into writing, they would invariably have cognizance and contractual recognition of payment obligations being created at that point in time, even if such sums might only become payable at a later time. Applying that to the transaction in the present case, it must have invariably been within the contemplation of PW4 and PW3, when they entered into the tenancy agreement, that PW3 would be obliged to make payments of rent every month_”.

99     In the present case, I noted that both the Prosecution and the Accused had different interpretations of transaction monies pertaining to Regulation 7(1)(b).

100    In applying the three-step framework in _Ting Choon Meng_ towards the interpretation of “transaction monies”:

##### i.    Step one of the three-step framework

101    In the present case, having considered both parties’ positions, I was of the view that both the Prosecution and the Accused’s interpretation of the term “transaction monies” were possible. However, I was more prepared to accept the Prosecution’s interpretation rather than the Accused’s interpretation.

102    The Accused’s interpretation focussed on the timing of the transaction. Such an interpretation would only work for transactions which were one-off, and it would not cover transactions which were meant to cover a period of time or over a series of events. For example, if a salesperson were to act for a landlord in the execution of a lease for say a two-year period. If we accept the Accused’s interpretation, his role as landlord’s agent would end the minute the tenancy agreement was executed, and the keys handed over by the landlord to the tenant. And if the landlord were to ask his agent to collect rental on his behalf from the tenant throughout the whole period of tenancy, that would mean that the monthly rentals that the estate agent would be collecting for the landlord for the whole period of tenancy was permissible in law and it would not be covered under Regulation 7 as the salesperson’s role would have ceased once the tenancy agreement had been signed and the keys handed over. I would agree with the Prosecution that this would lead to absurd results and make Regulation 7(1)(b) redundant. I also agreed with the analogy given by the Prosecution that in cases where it was a sale by developers and involved progress payments, the Accused’s interpretation would mean that the salesperson would be allowed to collect progress payments from the purchaser to be paid to the developers even though such payments were not in the form of crossed cheques or cashiers’ orders. I am of the view that the Accused’s interpretation could not be what was anticipated by the legislators.

103    I would agree with the Prosecution that the Prosecution’s interpretation would make more logical sense given the purpose of Regulation 7(1)(b) was to prevent errant agents from taking the monies from contracting parties to the sale and purchase of properties as well as the leasing of HDB properties.

##### ii.    Step two of the three-step framework

104    Under step two of the _Tan Cheng Bock_ framework, I would need to ascertain the legislative purpose or object of the Regulation 7(1)(b) and consider the general legislative purpose of the enactment by reference to any mischief that Parliament was seeking to address by it. As discussed earlier, it was clear to me that the main purpose of the Act and the Regulations was to put a legislative and regulatory framework in place to raise the professionalism of estate agents and salespersons and to protect the consumers who needed the services of such estate agents and salespersons. It was clear to me that the aim of Regulation 7 was to prevent the risks of errant estate agents and salespersons from running away with monies belonging to the parties who were involved in the sale and purchase of properties as well as the leasing of HDB properties. And as discussed earlier, this was evident when we refer to Regulation 7(2) where it was provided that estate agents or salesperson could only handle crossed cheques and cashier’s orders on behalf of parties.

##### iii.    Step three of the three-step framework

105    Under step three of the _Tan Cheng Bock_ framework, I would need to compare the possible interpretations of “transaction money” against the purpose or object of Regulation 7(1)(b). I noted that I would be allowed to refer to extraneous materials such as the Hansard to confirm but not to alter the ordinary meaning of the provision as purposively ascertained. However, my interpretation of the meaning of “transaction monies” must not lead to a result which was manifestly absurd or unreasonable.

106    I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission[\[note: 209\]](#Ftn_209) that the Accused’s interpretation of “transaction monies” could give rise to an arbitrary compartmentalisation of types of sums paid between parties. Based on the Accused’s interpretation, that risk of financial loss could change depending on when the estate agent/salesperson acted as an intermediary in the transaction. Whereas based on the Prosecution’s interpretation, there was no danger of financial loss to that party at any point of time so long as the monies that were handled were intricately linked to the lease transaction. Regulation 7(1) by itself also did not expressly introduce any timeframe to serve as a yardstick against which the act of handling or holding was analysed.

107    I agreed with the Prosecution that allowing the Accused’s interpretation to stand in the present situation would lead to the absurd outcome where the Accused was not allowed to handle rental deposit and first advance rental payment, but the Accused could proceed to handle the remaining monthly rental payable without Regulation 7(1) being evoked.

108    Also in a sale and purchase situation whereby there were progressive payments to be paid, it was clear that the Accused’s interpretation would also lead to a situation whereby the initial deposit payment was covered under Regulation 7(1) but the rest of the progress payments after the sale and purchase agreement had been signed would not be covered under Regulation 7(1) and the estate agent could do as he/she deemed fit and handle monies relating to the sale without contravening Regulation 7(1)(b).

109    I also noted that Regulation 7(2)(b) allowed an estate agent to receive remuneration and reimbursement in relation to the management, repair and renovation of the property. In the case of a lease of a property, the management, repair and renovation could technically take place at any point during the whole period of tenancy and not just at the point of the execution of the tenancy agreement and the handing over of possession. As such, if I were to accept the Accused’s interpretation, that would effectively render the phrasing of Regulation 7(2) redundant.

110    Given the above examples, I would agree with the Prosecution that their interpretation of “transaction monies” was more appropriate for the purposes of Regulation 7(1). The Accused’s interpretation, if accepted, would give rise and lead to absurd results. I would agree that the adoption of the Accused’s interpretation would lead to undesirable consequences that would detract from the legislative purpose of the Regulations.

Whether the consent or authorisation by PW4 to the Accused to help him collect the monies from PW3 could constitute a defence for the Accused under Regulation 7(2)

111    The Accused had also argued that he was allowed to collect the monies on behalf of PW4 (i.e., the rental deposit, advance rental as well as the monthly rental) as he was authorised by PW4 to collect these monies on his behalf. By saying that PW4 had consented to him collecting the monies on his behalf, what the Accused was effectively saying was that one could read an implied defence of consent into Regulation 7(1)(b).

112    I noted that Regulation 7(2) had expressly provided for only two exceptions to culpability under Regulation 7(1). Regulation 7(2) only allowed the estate agent or salesperson to collect crossed account cheques or cashier’s orders drawn in favour of the other party to the transaction and to receive such remuneration or reimbursements in relation to the management, repair or renovation of the property as the estate agent or salesperson may be entitled under a written contract or authorisation.

113    In the present case, given that Regulation 7(2) had only provided two exceptions to criminal liability under Regulation 7(1), I would agree with the Prosecution[\[note: 210\]](#Ftn_210) that one should not be allowed to read any other exceptions to Regulation 7(1) other than what had been expressly stated in Regulation 7(2).

114    If the Accused could agree with PW4 that Regulation 7(1) would not apply to him, then what is there to stop an estate agent/salesperson from agreeing with his client to say that a certain provision of the Regulation would not apply to him and his client. For example, the estate agent/salesperson could get an authorisation from his client to say that his client had consented to him referring the client to a moneylender when Regulation 6 strictly prohibited an estate agent/salesperson from doing so. Or the estate agent/salesperson could get his client’s consent to say that he was allowed to act for all parties to the transaction even though Regulation 5 had specifically disallowed the estate agent/salesperson from acting for both parties to the same transaction.

115    As such, I was of the view that one could not read any implied defence of consent into Regulation 7(2).

116    Given my views that there was no implied defence of consent in Regulation 7(2) and interpretation of “money” to include the not only the rental deposit and advance rental, but also all monthly rental payable by PW3 to PW4 throughout the entire period of the tenancy, I was therefore of the view that the monthly rentals which were collected by the Accused from PW3 in the 2nd to the 9th Charges were “transaction monies” for the purposes of Regulation 7(1)(b) and the 2nd to the 9th Charges were not invalid in law.

whether the accused could rely on regulation 7(2) for the debt of $4,120.40

117    The Accused had testified that PW4 was indebted to him in the sum of $4,120.40 and this debt had arisen from the Accused paying HDB arrears, Town Council conservancy charges, repair works relating to the Property and purchase of furniture. The Accused had also said that PW4 had authorised him to deduct this debt from the monthly rental which he had collected from PW3.

118    Given that I was of the view that the monthly rentals were also transaction monies under Regulation 7(1)(b), I would also need to determine if the debt of $4,120.40 owing by PW4 to the Accused was remuneration or reimbursement due to the Accused for the “management, repair or renovation” of the Property. The issue here would be whether the exceptions under Regulation 7(2) were available to the Accused in the present case.

119    Reading Regulations 7(1)(b) and 7(2) together, it was clear to me that if the Accused was seeking to rely on Regulation 7(2) for the debt of $4,120.40, the debt owing by PW4 to the Accused must be for the remuneration or reimbursement by PW4 to the Accused for the “management, repair or renovation” of the Property which the Accused was entitled to under a written contract or authorisation.

120    The Accused had on numerous occasions in the course of the trial repeated the fact that he had the consent/authorisation of PW4 to deduct the sum of $4,120.40 from the monthly rentals that he had collected from PW3.

121    Looking at the Accused’s evidence in court, I would agree with the Prosecution that it was not very clear from the evidence as to whether the sum of $4,120.40 which was owing by PW4 to the Accused was the Accused’s reimbursement for the “management, repair or renovation” of the Property or that it was just a personal debt owing by PW4 to the Accused which had nothing to do with the “management, repair or renovation” of the Property.

122    I noted that there were material inconsistencies in PW3’s, PW4’s and the Accused’s testimony as to what was the actual debt was owing by the PW4 to the Accused and how the debt was incurred:

> (a)     The Accused had during his Examination-In-Chief testified that PW4 had owed him $4,000 plus and that PW4 had prepared an authorisation letter dated 1 April 2018 (Exhibit D3) authorising him to collect the monthly rental from PW3[\[note: 211\]](#Ftn_211). I noted that in Exhibit D3, PW4 had written that the debt of $4,120.40 was for the payment of PW4’s HDB loans and Town Council charges[^212].

> (b)     However, during cross-examination, the Accused changed his story to state that the debt owing by PW4 to him was for “HDB loan, Town Council charge, fridge, washing machine etc”[\[note: 213\]](#Ftn_213).

> (c)     PW3, on the other hand, had testified that he was told by the Accused to pay the monthly rental to the Accused because the Accused had to purchase some furniture such as a new bed, a new TV and cabinets for the Property[\[note: 214\]](#Ftn_214).

> (d)     PW4 had also testified that when he decided to rent the Property to PW3, he was owing the Accused $4,000 plus for housing loan and conservancy charges[\[note: 215\]](#Ftn_215). However, when prompted by the Accused later on during his Examination-In-Chief, PW4 had changed his story to state that the $4,000 plus was for HDB loans arrears, Town Council conservancy charges and repair works which included the TV, the window grills, the cooker hob, the fridge[^216].

> (e)     I also noted that PW4 had again changed his story during cross-examination, and he went on to say that he had gotten to know the Accused in 2007 and at that time, PW4 was jobless and had no furniture. And the Accused had helped PW4 by buying furniture and a second-hand washing fridge and a washing machine for the flat so that PW4 could rent out the same. PW4 also said that the Accused had paid $3,000 to 4,000 plus to furnish up the flat in order for PW4 to rent out his flat[\[note: 217\]](#Ftn_217). In addition to the Accused spending money to do up the flat, PW4 also borrowed money from the Accused in the region of $1,000 plus[^218] to pay for outstanding loan repayment as well as Town Council conservancy charges. PW4 also said that he had borrowed monies from the Accused to pay off his phone bills as he had outstanding phone bills[^219].

123    I was of the view that given the many versions of the “debts” owing by PW4 to the Accused, it was not clear from the evidence what was the exact nature of the debt owing by PW4 to the Accused. It was also not clear as to whether the debt of $4,120.40 was the Accused’s “remuneration or reimbursement” for the “management, repair or renovation” of the Property or it was a personal debt.

124    However, I would agree with the Prosecution that the common ground across the testimonies of the Accused, PW3 and PW4 was that PW4 had owed the Accused monies for HDB arrears and Town Council conservancy charges and the Accused would loan monies to PW4 whenever he had financial difficulties[\[note: 220\]](#Ftn_220). It was clear to me that such debts would constitute personal debts owing by PW4 to the Accused as such debts were not related to the “management, repair or renovation” of the Property.

125    I also noted the Accused’s evidence that he had never acted as PW4’s estate agent in the renting of the Property nor had he collected any commission from PW4 as his estate agent at any point of time and that he had all the while been helping PW4 as a friend. This was confirmed by PW4 in his evidence. If the Accused had never acted for PW4 as the landlord’s salesperson, how could PW4 owe the Accused fees relating to the “management, repair or renovation” of the Property in his capacity as a salesperson? Moreover, it was clear in the present case that the Accused was PW3’s salesperson and not PW4’s salesperson in respect of the leasing of the Property from PW4 to PW3.

126    I agreed with the Prosecution’s contention[\[note: 221\]](#Ftn_221) that the Accused’s own documentary evidence (i.e., Exhibits P1/P6) confirmed that PW4’s debt arose from “his personal issue” which was in stark contrast to the notion of management, renovation or repair of the Property

127    It was clear to me that if the Accused had not been acting as PW4’s estate agent/salesperson in the “management, repair or renovation” of the Property, it must follow that the Accused would not be entitled to any “remuneration or reimbursement” under Regulation 7(2). After all, the Accused was PW3’s estate agent for the purposes of the leasing of the Property and he could not be acting for both PW3 and PW4 at the same time as that would be in breach of Regulation 5 which prevented the Accused to act for both PW3 and PW4 at the same time.

128    In any event, the onus was on the Accused to prove that the $4,120.40 was for the “management, repair or renovation” of the Property. I was of the view that the Accused had failed to discharge that burden of proof in the present case.

129    Given the above, I was of the view that the sum of $4,120.40 was a personal debt by PW4 to the Accused and it could not be regarded as “remuneration or reimbursements” due to the Accused for the “management, repair or renovation” of the Property under Regulation 7(2).

130    As the Accused was not PW4’s estate agent for the purposes of the leasing of the Property, I was also of the view that that the Accused was not allowed to rely on Regulation 7(2) to deduct the sum of $4,120.40 from the monthly rental which he had collected from PW4 even if he had wanted to rely on Regulation 7(2).

131    In any event, the Accused’s position all along was that he was no longer the salesperson in relation to the lease transaction after 19 May 2018. Given the Accused’s position, it would follow that the Accused could not avail himself of any defence under Regulation 7(2) for the monthly rentals in the alternative.

credibility of pw4 and the accused as witnesses

132    I had noted the Prosecution’s submissions relating to PW4[\[note: 222\]](#Ftn_222) and the Accused[^223]. I wish to state that I agreed with the Prosecution’s comments that:

> (a)     PW4 lacked credibility as a witness as he was generally evasive and that his evidence was inconsistent throughout the trial. It was also clear from the evidence that PW4 was unable to remember what had happened in relation to the lease of his Property to PW3 and that he was just agreeing with whatever the Accused had suggested to him during cross-examination.

> (b)     It was also clear to me that PW4 was not a neutral witness. PW4 had been the Accused’s friend for more than ten years and the Accused had been assisting him financially so that HDB would not re-possess his property and he would not be taken to court by the Town Council. The Accused had also helped PW4 to rent out his Property so that he could derive income from the rental of the Property. As such, PW4 was trying to help the Accused in his defence. For interested witnesses, it was trite law that the Courts must treat their evidence with caution. I would agree with the Prosecution that I should treat his testimony with a great amount of caution. Some clear examples were as follows:

>> (i)       PW4 had testified that he could not collect the any of the rental monies from PW3 because he did not have the time to meet up with PW3 to collect the rental monies. However, I noted from the evidence that even though PW3 had transferred the monies into the Accused’s personal bank account, the Accused had electronically transferred the rental monies into PW4’s account since July 2018 without having to meet up with PW4 to hand the monies directly to PW4. As such, I wondered why there was any need for the Accused to instruct PW3 to pay the rental monies into his account when PW3 could have just electronically banked the monies directly into PW4’s account.

>> (ii)       I also found it very strange when PW4 had decided to prepare a letter to CEA and HDB on 3 February 2018 in anticipation of a complaint by the Korean tenant who had just signed the Letter of Intent which was accepted by PW4 on 1 February 2018. I also noted that the Accused was the one who had conveniently prepared the letter for PW4.

>> (iii)       I also noted that PW4 had in Exhibit D1 stated that the Accused was acting as his agent in the lease transaction but in court he had changed his story to say that the Accused was not his agent but merely helping out as a friend.

> (c)     As for the Accused, I also agreed with the Prosecution’s views that the Accused was not an honest and truthful witness and that he had displayed a propensity to deliberately evade questions, and he would structure his answers to prevaricate his evidence as part of his attempt to spin a narrative of innocence.

whether PW3 had refused to pay the monthly rental to pw4 directly

133    The Accused had, when giving evidence in support of his defence, alleged that PW3 had refused to pay the monthly rental to PW4. This was however, disputed by PW3 who had testified that it was the Accused who had instructed him to pay the monthly rental to the Accused instead of paying directly to PW4. I also noted that the Accused had not cross-examined PW3 on this point nor has he put or suggested to PW3 to he had refused to pay the monthly rental to PW4.

134    In the present case, it was clear from the WhatsApp text conversation between the Accused that it was the Accused who had requested PW3 to pay the monthly rental to him directly and there was no evidence to show that PW3 had refused to pay the same to PW4 directly.

135    Given the above, I was more inclined to accept PW3’s version of events as compared to the Accused’s version that PW3 had refused to pay the monthly rental directly to PW4.

### My decision

136    In the present case, having considered all the evidence before me, I was of the view that the Prosecution had proved their case against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt in relation to all the nine charges and I thereby convicted the Accused of all the nine charges accordingly.

137    It was clear to me that the Accused had acted as PW3’s salesperson in the lease of the Property by PW4 to PW3. The Accused had also held monies relating to the lease transaction belonging to PW4 as evidenced by the undisputed facts above. I also agreed with the Prosecution that the Accused had intended to hold or handle the monies as he had given specific instructions to PW3 to deposit the monies to his bank account on different occasions which was clearly against the term of the tenancy which was for the monies to be deposited into PW4’s bank account.

## Accused’s antecedents

138    I noted that the Accused was a first offender, and he had no previous criminal records.

## Sentencing

### Prosecution’s Submission on Sentence[\[note: 224\]](#Ftn_224)

139    The Prosecution had sought a fine of $7,000 for each charge.

#### Prosecution’s considerations for sentencing

140    The Prosecution submitted that the Act was enacted to put in place a robust legislative and regulatory framework to better protect consumer interest and raise the professionalism of the real estate industry.

141    The Prosecution submitted that the public interest in ensuring that contraventions of the Regulations prohibiting the handling of transaction monies were duly punished could not be gainsaid.

142    The prohibition against estate agents and salespersons holding transaction monies was clearly for the protection of the public. While transaction monies in a sale of a property were generally much larger sums, lease of HDB properties such as the transaction in the present case also involved transaction monies that were not insignificant. If an estate agent or salesperson were to handle such transaction monies, he or she might compromise the integrity of the lease transaction and put his or her client and the public at risk. There was a real risk that the estate agent or salesperson could misappropriate the monies or convert the monies for his or her own use.

143    The Prosecution therefore submitted that the lack of actual harm caused to the victim was at best a neutral factor as the essence of Regulation 7 of the Regulations was aimed to prevent estate agents or salespersons from even receiving such transaction monies in the first place.

##### ii.    Aggravating Factors

144    The Prosecution submitted that the aggravating factors present in the present case were as follows[\[note: 225\]](#Ftn_225):

> (a)     The Accused’s conduct of handling transaction monies was hard to detect:

>> (i)       The Prosecution submitted that the nature of such offences were hard to detect. This was especially so given the manner in which the Accused had conducted himself in handling transaction monies vis-à-vis the security deposit and monthly rentals – by having verbally instructed PW3 to make payments directly to the Accused instead of in accordance with the terms of parties’ tenancy agreement. On the face of the transactional documents, it would have been extremely difficult to identify that transaction monies had been received by the Accused on the landlord’s behalf.

>> (ii)       In the present case, it was fortuitous that investigations triggered by a complaint relating to an aborted transaction involving the Property uncovered the Accused’s offences. Otherwise, the same would have been very hard to detect by the CEA.

> (b)     There was a degree of planning and sophistication of execution by the Accused.

> (c)     The Accused was also in a position of potential conflict of interest. The Accused owed a duty to PW3 to act in PW3’s interest. However, the Accused had preferred his own interests over PW3’s when he arranged for PW3’s payments of transaction monies to go through him rather than paying directly to PW4.

> (d)     The Accused had shown no remorse over his conduct and he had expounded conspiracies of nefarious conducts by the CEA’s investigation officers and had made serious allegations against the officers.

> (e)     The Accused’s deplorable conduct during trial whereby:

>> (i)       He had engaged several delay tactics to prevent the trial from being expeditiously completed:

>>> (A)       At the 1st tranche of the trial, on the 2nd day of trial, the Accused had alleged that he had sought referral from a Member of Parliament to obtain legal representation in order to adjourn the trial.

>>> (B)       During the 2nd tranche, the Accused had refused to attend court on 25 February 2021, and he sought treatment at the Ng Teng Fong Hospital.

>>> (C)       The Accused had failed to attend court on a number of occasions without the proper medical certificate.

>>> (D)       At the third tranche of the trial in July 2021, the Accused had first elected to plead guilty and was duly convicted on 26 July 2021. However, at the PG sentencing hearing on 29 July 2021, the Accused displayed an about-turn and qualified his plea on the pretext of insisting that the court listened to his version of events.

>> (ii)       The Accused had displayed disregard to the seriousness of legal proceedings and his refusal to submit to judicial control:

>>> (A)       The Accused had under the guise of exercising his right to cross-examine the prosecution’s witnesses, snuck in submissions and arguments.

>>> (B)       The Accused would cross examine the witnesses on irrelevant issues and/or facts at hand and he also spared no quarters in continuously humiliating PW4’s financial impecuniosity during cross-examination.

>>> (C)       The Accused also interjected proceedings throughout the course of proceedings to prematurely make submissions and arguments.

### Mitigation

145    The Accused had filed his Mitigation Plea[\[note: 226\]](#Ftn_226) at 6.15 am on 10 March 2022 which was the day of his sentencing. However, I noted that instead of mitigating, the Accused had maintained his innocence and he had repeated his position that he had not done anything wrong and that he was merely helping PW4. The Accused had also repeated his attack on the investigation officer and the CEA prosecutor. The Accused also maintained his position was that he was not guilty of the nine charges which I had convicted him of earlier.

146    However, in his oral submission to this court, I noted that the Accused had highlighted the following mitigating factors:

> (a)     That he was facing some financial difficulties as he had received very little income for the past one and a half years because of the Covid situation.

> (b)     That he had a daughter who had some health problem and he needed to look after his daughter.

> (c)     That he was merely helping out PW4 and he did not personally benefit from this arrangement.

### My Sentence

147    The punishment prescribed for an offence under Regulation 7(1)(b) and punishable under Regulation 7(3) was a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or both.

148    I agreed with the Prosecution that the applicable sentencing principles in the present case were general and specific deterrence. I accepted the Prosecution’s submission that there was a need for general deterrence to deter likeminded potential offenders from committing similar offences in future. As for specific deterrence, I agreed with the Prosecution that given the Accused’s position that he had done nothing wrong and that he was justified in collecting the monies on behalf of PW4, there was a need to send an appropriate signal to the Accused that his conduct was wrong and criminal in nature, and he should refrain from such conducts in future.

#### Aggravating factors

149    I noted the following aggravating factors in the present case:

> (a)     The Accused had committed a total of nine similar charges under Regulation 7(1)(b). While I noted that all nine charges had all arisen from one lease transaction, the high number of charges clearly showed that the Accused had not committed a once-off offence but a series of offences.

> (b)     I also took into account the total amount of deposit money, advance rental and monthly rental involved in all the 9 charges which had added up to quite a substantial sum. This amount represented the potential harm and possible loss that PW4 could have suffered if the Accused had not forwarded the monies that he had received from PW3.

> (c)     The period of offending was almost ten months, from April 2018 till January 2019. In the present case, I noted that the original period of the lease was only 12 months. If not detected, it was clear to me that the Accused would have continued with his arrangement with PW4 throughout the entirety of the period of the lease. This was evident from the fact that the Accused had helped and loaned money to PW4 to buy a new air-conditioner in November 2018 and he had entered into a new instalment arrangement whereby he was supposed to collect the rental on behalf of PW4 and deduct $400 a month for the payment of the new air-conditioner from January 2019 onwards.

> (d)     I also agreed with the Prosecution that the Accused’s offending nature was hard to detect, and it would usually go undetected unless something were to happen to the transaction money that the estate agent or salesperson was handling by which time it would have been too late for the victim and the victim might not be able to recover any of the transaction monies that had been handled by the estate agent or salesperson.

> (e)     I also agreed with the Prosecution that the Accused was put in a position of conflict with PW3, and he had chosen to act in his own interest rather than PW3’s interest whom he represented. If there were any dispute between the Accused and PW4 over the issue of monies and the Accused chose not to hand over any of the monies which he had received from PW3 to PW4, PW4 could still technically go after PW3 for the payment of the monthly rental as the tenancy agreement had provided that PW3 was to pay directly to PW4. In the present case, there was also clear evidence that PW3 did not receive any confirmation from PW4 directly that it was alright for PW3 to hand the monthly rental directly to the Accused instead of PW4.

150    I also noted that the Accused had claimed trial to all the proceeded charges and that meant that the usual sentencing discount that was usually granted to a case whereby an offender had pleaded guilty would not be applicable to the Accused.

151    In the present case, I also noted that the Accused had not shown any signs of any remorse even after I had convicted him of nine charges. Even during mitigation and sentencing, the Accused had argued that he should not be convicted of the charges against him, and he had insisted that he was not guilty of the offences.

152    The Accused was entitled to his day in court. The mere fact of claiming trial was not tantamount to an aggravating factor (See _Thong Sing Hock v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGHC 47</span>).

#### Accused’s conduct during trial

153    The Prosecution had also referred me to the case of _Rahj Kamal Bin Abdullah v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 3 SLR(R) 227</span> (“_Rahj Kamal_”) where Yong Pung How CJ had at \[38\] stated that an accused’s conduct could be taken as an aggravating factor for the purposes of enhancing his sentence imposed. The Prosecution had submitted that I should regard the Accused’s conduct during trial as aggravating in the way he tried to attack the Prosecution’s witnesses (especially PW2 and PW4) and the manner in which he tried to delay proceedings.

154    As regards to the Accused’s conduct during trial, while I noted the remarks of Yong Pung How CJ in _Rahj Kamal_ as well as the points raised by the Prosecution as to the Accused’s conduct during trial, I noted the Accused’s belief that he had done nothing wrong. I was also aware of the fact that he was not legally trained and was acting in person. As such, I was not minded to hold the way the Accused had conducted against him given his beliefs and the fact that he was acting in person and he was not familiar with the court processes and procedure.

155    However, I would agree with the Prosecution that some of the Accused’s delaying tactics such as failing to turn up for hearing and tendering medical certificates which did not exempt him from court attendance and checking himself into hospital on the day of the trial as well as some of his behaviour during trial were not acceptable behaviour and they did result in the trial taking longer than usual.

156    As for the Accused’s about-turn when he had initially elected to plead guilty on 26 July 2021, whilst I accepted that the Accused was entitled to change his mind about pleading guilty, his conduct did lead to a wasted four days of trial dates as he had actually accepted the Statement of Facts on the first day of that tranche and his plea was accordingly taken, and the matter adjourned to the final day of that tranche for his then lawyer to prepare his mitigation plea. However, on the final day of the tranche, the Accused did a 180-degree about-turn and qualified his plea during his mitigation plea.

#### Sentence

157    In the present case, I had requested, and the Prosecution had tendered their Submissions on the Sentencing Precedents[\[note: 227\]](#Ftn_227).

158    It was clear from the cases that the usual sentence that was imposed by the courts for cases involving accused persons handling transaction monies whereby the accused person had pleaded guilty was about $2,500 per charge: see _PP v Poh Choong How_, _PP v Chng Yew Tiong_ and _PP v Michelle Lai Yew Ling__[\[note: 228\]](#Ftn_228)_.

159    Where an accused had pleaded guilty in the course of a trial, the courts have imposed fines which were higher than the usual amounts of about $2,500 per charge. In _PP v Sharifah Sofiah Binte Syed Ali_[\[note: 229\]](#Ftn_229) (“_Sharifah Sofiah Binte Syed Ali_”), the accused faced one charge of handling transaction monies amounting to $1,800. She had claimed trial to the charge and had pleaded guilty on the second day of trial and the court had imposed a fine $3,600 in default 18 days imprisonment.

160    As for the case of _PP v Ang Siew Teen Tina__[\[note: 230\]](#Ftn_230)_ (“_Ang Siew Teen Tina_”), I noted that the accused in that matter had pleaded guilty to one charge for handling the rental deposit of $4,500 for the sub-lease of a sub-unit at a HDB commercial property and the court had imposed a fine of $8,500 in default 40 days imprisonment.

161    I agreed with the Prosecution that the facts in _Ang Siew Teen Tina_ were far more aggravating in that the quantum of the transaction money was much higher than in the present case. There were additional aggravating factors in that the accused had lied about the whereabouts of the rental deposit and she had issued a dishonoured cheque as restitution. The accused in _Ang Siew Teen Tina_ had also taken almost thirteen months to make restitution of the rental deposit.

162    I also noted that the court had imposed fines in the range of $5,300 to $7,200 per charge in the case of _PP v Syed Omar Bin Syed Hassan__[\[note: 231\]](#Ftn_231)_ (“_Syed Omar Bin Syed Hassan_”)_._ The accused in _Syed Omar Bin Syed Hassan_ had initially claimed trial to six charges under Regulation 7(1)(b) and he had pleaded guilty to four charges with two of the charges taken into consideration during the course of the trial. The accused in _Syed Omar Bin Syed Hassan_ was the husband of the accused in _Sharifah Sofiah Binte Syed Ali._ I noted that there were the following aggravating factors present in that case. The accused had received rental deposits and advance rental from the tenant’s daughter via the accused’s wife, but he did not pass the monies to the landlord. The accused had also acted in direct contravention of the landlord’s instruction for the tenant to deposit all rental payments to the landlord’s bank account by receiving the monthly rental from the tenant into his own personal bank account. In all, the accused had collected a total of $7,200 belonging to the landlord. The landlord had reported the accused to the CEA and the police in October 2015 but the accused only returned the $7,200 to the landlord more than one year later in November 2016.

163    In the present case, it was clear from the evidence that the Accused had given all the monies that he had collected from PW3 on behalf of PW4 immediately after PW3 had forwarded the monies to the Accused. The Accused also had instruction from PW4 to collect the monies on PW4’s behalf and he did not make up any lies to PW4 about the monies. As such, I would agree with the Prosecution that the Accused’s culpability in the present case was lower than the accused persons in _Syed Omar Bin Syed Hassan_ and _Ang Siew Teen Tina._ However, I also noted that the Accused had claimed trial to all nine charges as opposed to _Syed Omar Bin Syed Hassan_ and _Ang Siew Teen Tina_ where the accused persons in both cases had pleaded guilty to their charges.

164    The Prosecution had proposed a fine of $7,000 per charge for the Accused. Whilst I accepted the factors as raised by the Prosecution, having considered the sentencing precedents and the fact that the Accused was a first offender, that there was no real harm or financial loss caused to PW4 from all nine transactions and the Accused had handed over the monies which he had collected from PW3 to PW4 within one to two days after he had received the same from PW3, I was of the view that fine of $7.000 per charge proposed by the Prosecution was on the high side.

165    Having considered all the above factors and taking into account the totality principle[\[note: 232\]](#Ftn_232), I was of the view that a fine of $5,500 per charge in default 10 days’ imprisonment with a total fine imposed for all nine charges of $49,500 in default 90 days’ imprisonment was not unreasonable. I accordingly imposed a fine of $5,500 per charge in default 10 days’ imprisonment. The total fine imposed for all nine charges was $49,500 in default 90 days’ imprisonment.

166    I also wished to address the point raised by the Accused that he did not benefit from the arrangement. I did not agree totally with the Accused on this point. I was of the view that the Accused had benefitted from his arrangement with PW4. Because of the Accused’s arrangement with PW4, the Accused was able to rent out PW4’s Property and earn rental commission from the tenants. Also, by collecting the rental from the tenants, the Accused had ensured that PW4 would repay him whatever he had loaned to PW4 in the past. It was clear to me that the arrangement that the Accused had made with PW4 had benefitted the Accused personally.

167    The Accused being dissatisfied with my decision had filed his Notice of Appeal against my decision on conviction and sentence. The Accused had also applied for and I had granted a stay of execution of the payment of the fine pending appeal. The Accused had also been granted bail pending appeal.
