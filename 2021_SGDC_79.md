\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9310/2019/01\].

22 April 2021

### District Judge Tan Jen Tse:

## Introduction

1       The accused was convicted after trial on seven counts of corruptly giving gratification to two senior employees of Mustafa & Samsuddin Co Pte Ltd (“Mustafa”). The employees were firstly, Hidayathullah s/o Ahamed Maricar (“Hidaya”), the head/ manager of the shirts department, and secondly, Mohd Yasin Shahul Hameed (“Shahul”), a supervisor and the second highest ranking employee in the shirts department.

2       The accused lodged an appeal against conviction and sentence. After the issue of the Grounds of Decision (“the GD”), the accused successfully applied to the High Court in CM 45/2020 to call Shahul as a defence witness and for his additional evidence to be taken. The High Court further ordered:-

> After the District Judge has taken the additional evidence, he is to state what effect, if any, the additional evidence has on his earlier verdict, including those portions involving Hidaya, bearing in mind particularly that charge 3 concerned a joint-gift of $5,000 to both Hidaya and Shahul which the District Judge apportioned 50/50 between Hidaya and Shahul.

3       Shahul’s testimony was essentially that he did not receive gratification from the accused.[^1] Having considered his additional evidence and the evidence as a whole, I remained satisfied that the prosecution had discharged its burden of proving its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

4       For the sake of completeness, I should also state that although the High Court ordered that witnesses could be recalled if it was considered necessary to do so, none of the parties applied to recall any witnesses. No witnesses were therefore recalled.

## The charges relating to Shahul

5       The accused was convicted on the following charges involving Shahul:-

## The issue

6       The main issue raised by the defence at the remitted hearing was whether Shahul received gratification from the accused. The defence did not contend that the additional evidence affected the verdict for the charges involving Hidaya. I was also of the view that the additional evidence did not have any effect on the charges relating to him. There was therefore no reason for me to re-consider my previous decision on the charges relating to Hidaya.

## Summary of reasons for the original findings on the issue of gratification

7       The full reasons for finding that the accused gave gratification to Hidaya and Shahul were stated in the GD. In convicting the accused, I found that he gave gratification to Shahul on the occasions mentioned in the third, seventh, eighth and ninth charges. The reasons for this included:-

> (a)     In his four email to his sister (Exhibits P6 to P9), the accused admitted to giving Shahul gratification on the occasions stated in the charges and sought to claim reimbursement;

> (b)     He confirmed this position and confessed in his police statements that he gave Shahul gratification on those occasions;

> (c)     His late claim in court that he fabricated the four email to claim commissions from his uncles was incredible; and

> (d)     His claim that he told untruths to the CPIB as he did not have sight of the requisite documents was totally implausible.

## Shahul’s additional evidence had no effect on the earlier verdict

8       Although Shahul denied receiving gratification, his evidence was not compelling. It did not carry enough weight to convince me that the four email and the accused’s confessions to the CPIB were unreliable and that they did not represent the truth. There was no reason for the accused to lie to CPIB and admit that he gave Shahul gratification if this was not the case. There was therefore no basis to displace the original finding that the accused gave Shahul gratification on four occasions.

9       To the contrary, Shahul’s evidence corroborated the prosecution’s case in some respects, in particular, for the seventh charge.

## Shahul’s evidence corroborated the prosecution’s case

10     For the seventh charge, the accused was convicted of giving gratification of $10,000 to Shahul in or around December 2009. Shahul denied receiving any gratification.

11     In his email to his sister dated 28 December 2009 (Exhibit P6), the accused stated that he gave $10,000 to Shahul as “he need for his house purchase”. He also informed CPIB in Exhibit P12 that he gave $10,000 to Shahul as he needed it for renovation.[^2] Further in his statement to the CPIB (Exhibit P13), the accused stated that he had given money to Shahul for his “house purchase”. I had found that this evidence was reliable.

12     Apart from the email and statements, no evidence had previously been adduced to show that Shahul had purchased and renovated property. At the remitted hearing, Shahul confirmed that at the time gratification was given, he had indeed purchased an HDB flat and was in the process of doing renovations. He testified that he completed the sale of his three-room HDB flat at Lorong Lew Lian in November 2009.[^3] He purchased another HDB flat at Serangoon with his wife around December 2009. Before he moved in with his wife and family, he renovated his flat.[^4] The renovations took place in late 2009 or early 2010.[^5] Moreover, by 5th December 2009, he had viewed the new flat and knew what parts of the flat he wanted to renovate.[^6]

13     Shahul’s evidence lent credence to prosecution’s case that Shahul told the accused that he needed money for his property and that the accused gave Shahul $10,000 for this purpose. In other words, the context in which the accused gave gratification to Shahul was confirmed by Shahul’s testimony. This buttressed my findings that the content of the accused’s email and his confessions to the police were true and could be relied on.

14     To exculpate himself, Shahul denied telling the accused about the purchase and renovation of his flat.[^7] However, he could not provide a cogent account of how the accused otherwise found out about this. He could only speculate that some other staff of Mustafa such as Hidaya must have informed the accused. However, it was doubtful that anyone else would have had any reason to inform the accused that Shahul needed money for the purchase and renovation of his flat, or to have solicited gratification on his behalf.

15     In all likelihood, the accused must have found out that Shahul needed funds to purchase and renovate his property from Shahul himself. This was apparent from Exhibits P6, P12 and P13 where the accused stated that Shahul needed money for his flat. If Shahul had not told the accused that he needed money, there would have been no reason for the accused to give him $10,000 and confess that he did so.

16     The accused had on 11 December 2009 withdrawn $15,000 from his bank account. I found at \[61\] of the GD that the withdrawal of this large sum of money supported the prosecution’s case that he gave Shahul gratification. Shahul testified that he had coincidentally deposited $15,000 into his bank account on the same day.[^8] However, as it was not the prosecution’s case that the money Shahul deposited came from the accused, I placed no weight on this.

## Shahul downplayed his role at Mustafa

17     As Hidaya’s deputy, Shahul was an important person in Mustafa’s shirt operations. He was directly in charge of 10 salesmen at four branches of Mustafa.[^9] However, he downplayed his role in the procurement process. When Shahul testified, the accused had already been convicted. Shahul would have known that as a receiver of a bribe, he would have been implicated as well.

18     Shahul claimed that he had no authority to order shirts or sign purchase orders when Hidaya was not around. He claimed that the only one who could do so was the boss, Mustaq. The apparent submission by the defence was that as he did not have the ability to influence shirt orders, there was no reason for him to be given gratification.[^10]

19     I was of the view that Shahul was untruthful in his evidence and that he was deliberately limiting his role. His evidence was contradicted by his superior Hidaya, who testified that Shahul had the authority to sign purchase orders in his absence. Hidaya’s claim was corroborated by objective contemporaneous evidence. In the purchase order (Exhibit P16), Shahul’s signature and stamp appeared in the “Order By” field. If he did not have the authority to order shirts, there was no reason for him to sign in this field. Since he did so, this strongly indicated that he had the authority to order shirts in Hidaya’s absence. The accused was handed the signed copy of Exhibit P16.[^11] He must have appreciated that Shahul had the power to influence things, such as by signing purchase orders in Hidaya’s absence.

20     Further, as I had found, Shahul had other business roles to play where he was able to influence things in favour of the accused. These included overseeing Mustafa’s logistics and renovations.[^12] This was not challenged by the defence at the remitted hearing.

## The third charge (DAC 925963-2016)

21     For the third charge, the accused was convicted of giving gratification of $5,000 to Hidaya and Shahul in or around July 2011 in the vicinity of Mustafa. I had stated at \[40\] of the GD that I apportioned this $5,000 equally between them. In CM 45/2020, in ordering that the District Court state the effect of the additional evidence, the High Court specifically referred to the third charge where there was a joint gift of $5,000 to both Hidaya and Shahul.

22     The additional evidence recorded from Shahul did not have any effect on the third charge. It did not shed any light on how the joint gift should be apportioned. Although I apportioned the $5,000 equally, this did not play a part in determining whether the accused was guilty of the offence. Rather, the apportionment was only relevant to sentence, since the amount of gratification was one of the factors to be considered in passing sentence.

## Conclusion

23     The additional evidence recorded did not have an adverse effect on my earlier verdict. On the totality of the evidence, I remained satisfied that my earlier verdict was correct and that it should stand.
