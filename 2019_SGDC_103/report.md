### District Judge Tan Jen Tse:

## INTRODUCTION

1       The accused was an on-line seller of collectible toys known as “Hot Toys”. When he failed to deliver the toys ordered, various buyers lodged police reports against him. This led to 48 counts of cheating punishable under s 420 of the Penal Code being preferred against him. The prosecution proceeded on 8 charges relating to 2 alleged victims and stood down the other 40 charges. It was alleged that the accused had deceived various buyers into believing that he was selling them Hot Toys, thereby inducing them to deliver various sums of money to him. A sample charge is as follows:-

DAC 938553/2016

You, Tham Wai Kong… are charged that you, on the 13th day of November 2014, Singapore, did cheat one Tan Gee Pin _(the “_**_victim_**_”)_, to wit, by deceiving him into believing that you are selling him two sets of “Hot Toys Iron Man Igor” at S$850, a fact which you knew to be false, and by such manner of deception, you dishonestly induced the victim to deliver a sum of S$850, to wit, by transferring S$850 to your POSB Saving Account No.XXX, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 420 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

2       The details of the charges which the prosecution proceeded on are set out in the following table:-

3       At the end of trial, the accused was found guilty and convicted on all 8 charges. He was sentenced to 3 months’ imprisonment per charge. Sentence in two of the charges, namely DAC 938558-2016 and DAC 938588-2016, were to run consecutively so that the accused would serve a total of 6 months’ imprisonment.

4       The accused has filed an appeal against conviction and sentence and has been released on bail pending appeal.

## BACKGROUND FACTS

5       At the material time, the accused represented himself to be a seller of collectible figurines produced by ‘Hot Toys’ (“the toys”). He started to advertise the sale of the toys on Facebook groups in 2014, where hobbyists held discussions and where the toys were traded, bought and sold. He sold the toys which are the subject matter of the charges on a “pre-order” basis i.e. he would collect money first, with the toys being manufactured and delivered later.

6       Tan Gee Pin (PW1) and Lee Karsheng (PW2) were also members of the group. Both of them had seen the accused’s advertisements for the toys. They communicated with the accused via Facebook Messenger, placed orders for various toys and transferred funds to the accused’s POSB bank account (“the accused’s bank account”) to purchase the toys. The details of their purchases are stated in the table of charges.

7       Apart from one unit of _Igor_ which was delivered to PW1 on or around 6 June 2015, no other toys relating to the charges were delivered. The accused had however, on or around 17 June 2015, delivered one _Heartbreaker_ figurine costing $230 to PW1, which is not the subject matter of any of the charges.

8       The accused had refunded $212.50 to PW2 on 27 April 2015 for not delivering an _Igor_ figurine. He had also on 18 May 2015 refunded $300 to PW2 for non-delivery of _Hot Rod_. These are not the subject matter of any of the charges.

9       On 14 October 2015, PW1 filed a police report (Exhibit P1) against the accused due to non-delivery of the items ordered and as the accused had become uncontactable either via handphone or Facebook messenger.

10     On 28 November 2015, PW2 lodged a police report (Exhibit P3) against the accused since the accused had not delivered his items and had become uncontactable since around 22 August 2015.

## THE ISSUES

11     Section 420 of the Penal Code provides that:-

**Cheating and dishonestly inducing a delivery of property**

420.  Whoever cheats and thereby dishonestly induces the person deceived to deliver any property to any person, or to make, alter or destroy the whole or any part of a valuable security, or anything which is signed or sealed, and which is capable of being converted into a valuable security, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine.

12     The accused had represented to PW1 and PW2 that he would sell them the toys stated in the charges and in consequence thereof, they transferred money to his bank account. The sole issue was whether the accused had cheated by dishonestly inducing PW1 and PW2 (the persons deceived) to transfer the money on the false promise that he would deliver the toys they ordered.

13     While there was no direct evidence of the accused’s intention, the prosecution submitted that an irresistible inference should be drawn from the following factors that there was dishonest inducement:-[^1]

(a)     The conduct of the accused in becoming uncontactable after he failed to deliver the toys; and

(b)     The accused’s account of how he procured the toys and the reasons for not delivering the toys to PW1 and PW2.

14     In his defence, the accused claimed to be a genuine seller of Hot Toys. From what could be discerned, his defence was as follows:-

(a)     He was the victim of a vast conspiracy of certain individuals whose aim was to frame him;

(b)     He was prevented from delivering the toys as he was the victim of malicious rumours spread about him on the internet;

(c)     He was a genuine seller of Hot Toys and not a scammer; and

(d)     He had a genuine Russian supplier of Hot Toys named “Antanov”.

## EVALUATION OF EVIDENCE AND FINDINGS

## No evidence of conspiracy against the accused

15     The accused claimed that he did not commit the offences and that he was being framed. The crux of his case (as stated in his final written submissions) was that:-

I would like to highlight to the honourable court, why I should not be penalized for a “fix up” or “frame up” job just because I exposed sophisticated local criminals for their criminal activities.

Till this day I maintain that I am a victim of a co-ordinated “frame up” job to get me arrested and charged for something I did not commit.

16     The accused claimed to have exposed at least 9 individuals for various offences which ranged from money laundering, massive criminal breach of trust, corruption, and rape.[^2] He asserted that they were now making him a scapegoat so that his conviction in the present case would render him an untrustworthy witness should these “criminals” be prosecuted.

17     The accused’s conspiracy claim was outlandish and spurious.[^3] None of the witnesses he called supported him or gave any evidence in his favour. Cheot Zhi Chen (DW2), an officer with the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (“CPIB”) who investigated into the matter after the accused lodged a CPIB report, testified that the accused’s claims were not supported by any evidence.

18     The accused even questioned the integrity of the trial Deputy Public Prosecutor (“DPP”) whom he asserted lied in court. He further alleged that he had an unsuccessful transaction with a Deputy Senior State Counsel (“DSSC”) over a $30 million deal. He asserted that the DSSC, who was the superior officer of the trial DPP, had looked through his file and said, “I’m going to get back at you, man.” He claimed that both the trial DPP and the DSSC had breached the law.[^4] Having considered the accused’s allegations, there was no basis to criticize the conduct of the trial DPP, the DSSC or the prosecution.

19     There was absolutely no basis to accept the accused’s bare assertion that there was a conspiracy against him. If he honestly held the belief that others were conspiring to harm him, this was in all likelihood a figment of his imagination.

## No evidence of malicious internet rumours

20     The accused also asserted that from the latter part of 2014, malicious rumours had been spread on the internet by certain conspirators led by one ‘Glenn Chan’, which were to the effect that the accused could not deliver the items ordered by his customers. According to him, “pandemonium” ensued and there was a mass cancellation of orders. The scale was such that he was unable to give refunds to his all customers. The accused claimed that he had refunded money from his own pocket although there was no need for him to do so as the cancellations were not legitimate.[^5] This was one of many unfounded and unsubstantiated assertions made by the accused during the course of trial.

21     It should firstly be noted that PW1 and PW2 could not cancel their orders as the accused did not allow them to. For example, when PW1 asked the accused on 4 March 2015 if he could obtain a refund for _Peacemaker_ and _Python_ so that he could channel his funds towards the purchase of _Hulkbuster_, the accused refused his request.[^6] It was therefore incumbent on the accused to procure the toys for PW1 and PW2 or make the necessary refunds. His claim to the effect that he could not afford the refunds was not credible. By his own account, he had a safe which was full of cash.

22     To support his claim of the alleged malicious rumours, the accused relied on Exhibit D6 which contained various on-line posts. In my view, Exhibit D6 did not lend any support to the accused’s claim. The first post (dated 28 January 2015) originated from the accused and alleged that Glenn Chan had tried to find out what the accused’s customers had ordered and how much they paid.[^7] Significantly, the accused did not even mention that Glenn Chan had spread malicious rumours about him failing to deliver the items his customers ordered. While the accused also claimed that Glenn Chan had spread rumours on other forums, no evidence was tendered to show this.

23     The accused also admitted that Exhibit D6 did not show that any orders had been cancelled because of the alleged rumours.[^8] It therefore did not support his theory that malicious on-line rumours led to a mass cancellation of orders. PW1 and PW2 did not ask for refunds on the basis of any alleged internet rumours, but because the accused failed to deliver the toys they ordered.

24     I therefore found the accused’s claims regarding the on-line rumours to be unfounded.

## The accused’s delivery record

25     To support his claim that he was a genuine seller of Hot Toys, the accused produced a list showing that he had made 38 deliveries of the toys (Exhibit D18). He also tendered a list showing that he had made refunds to 32 customers in the amount of $8,830.50 when he failed to make delivery (Exhibit D19). It was not in dispute that for the 48 charges before the court, the accused had not made delivery.

26     Based on these figures, the accused had only delivered about one-third of the items ordered by his customers. His delivery and refund record taken alone, did not support his claim that he was a genuine seller, since his record could not be considered as good. Instead, the court had to look at the totality of the evidence to determine if it could be inferred whether the accused had intended to cheat PW1 and PW2 or was (as he claimed) a genuine seller of Hot Toys.

## The accused’s evidence relating to his supply of Hot Toys

27     One of the key issues in determining if the accused intended to cheat PW1 and PW2 was whether he took steps to procure the toys they ordered. He claimed that his supplier was a Russian named Antanov, who sourced the toys from Russia and Eastern Europe. When the accused received on-line orders from his customers, he wrote them down on a piece of paper. He handed the piece of paper to Antanov or his friends when they visited Singapore once or twice a year. He did not make a copy of the piece of paper or keep his own records of what he had ordered.[^9] He would pre-pay his orders in full from the stash of cash he kept at home.[^10] To ensure that he only sold to collectors and not resellers, he placed a pre-order limit of one Hot Toy figurine per customer.[^11]

28     Having assessed the evidence, I did not think that the accused’s testimony relating to his alleged supplier was credible for the reasons which will be stated below.

## The accused’s evidence on Antanov was incredible

29     The accused’s testimony on Antanov was incredible and it was doubtful if Antanov even existed. While he claimed that he had known Antanov for many years and even traded in expensive watches with him, he could not even provide Antanov’s full name. His evidence relating to his dealings with Antanov was sketchy and founded solely on his own bare claims.

#### No valid contact details

30     The accused’s failure to provide Antanov’s valid contact details weighed against his claim that a person named Antanov was his supplier of Hot Toys. He could only provide a non-working telephone number to IO Ng Shiunn Jye (PW3).[^12] He could not even provide Antanov’s email address or any other contact details, such as a physical address. In my view, this indicated that it was highly unlikely that the accused could have placed orders for PW1 and PW2’s toys with Antanov.

#### The accused’s evidence on how he dealt with Antanov was dubious

31     The accused’s evidence was to the effect that he only placed orders for the toys when he met Antanov or his friends when they visited Singapore once or twice a year. I found his evidence to be dubious. It was difficult to believe that any honest or genuine online seller would conduct business in such a manner, when orders could easily have been communicated by email, facsimile or even by post to the supplier.

32     The accused’s testimony that he wrote down his customers’ orders on a piece of paper and handed the only copy to Antanov or his friends was also unbelievable. The accused dealt with many customers who had paid him a substantial amount of money. It was unfathomable that he did not even take the simple precaution of making a photocopy or a taking a photograph of this piece of paper, but instead relied on Antanov to keep records for him. The lack of business records indicated that it was unlikely that the accused was genuinely trading in Hot Toys or that he had ordered the toys from Antanov.

33     The accused did not provide any credible account of how he knew when Antanov or his friends would visit Singapore, how Antanov quoted for the toys, how he knew how much to pay Antanov and how they liaised on business matters such as delivery of the items. There was in fact nothing at all to show that the accused had ever communicated with Antanov.

#### No documentary evidence to support the accused’s claims

34     In view of the accused’s assertion that Antanov and he had a long history of dealing, it would be reasonable to expect that there would be a documentary or evidentiary trail linking them. This could take the form of email, SMS, telephone records, or other correspondence on issues such as the price, availability of items, delivery schedules and payment. These were strikingly absent.

35     Further, if any items had been delivered by Antanov, there must have been proof of delivery. The accused informed the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) as early as 14 June 2016 that he could produce the delivery orders[^13] but he did not do so nor did he tender these documents in court.

36     The accused’s case was characterized by a total absence of documentary evidence showing any dealings with Antanov, whether in the past or in relation to the items ordered by PW1 and PW2. The absence of such evidence rendered his claim that he had placed orders with Antanov unlikely. There was no evidence to show that the accused had tried to procure the undelivered items which form the subject matter of the charges.

## No valid reason to stop delivery of items PW1 and PW2 ordered

37     The accused testified that after he fell out with Antanov around May or June 2015 over the issue of provision of refunds by the accused to his customers, he instructed Antanov to stop deliveries as customers no longer wanted their orders.[^14] However, at no time were the orders of PW1 and PW2 cancelled.

38     Even if the accused had placed orders for PW1 and PW2’s items with Antanov, it would have been irrational to stop Antanov (whom he paid in full) from delivering the items. Instead, the logical thing was to have instructed Antanov to make delivery, so that the orders made by PW1 and PW2 could be fulfilled. If the accused was truly a genuine seller, there would be no reason as to why he would have disabled himself from delivering the toys his customers ordered.

## The accused was untruthful and evasive and became uncontactable

39     Despite the accused’s claim that he had always been contactable via Facebook Messenger, Watsapp or by his handphone, this was clearly not the case. In fact, he was not forthright in his dealings with PW1 and PW2.

#### The accused misled PW1 and failed to respond to messages

40     PW1 had ordered various toys between 13 November 2014 and 31 December 2014. According to the chat logs between the accused and PW1 (Exhibit P2), PW1 started enquiring about the status of his various orders or the possibility of a refund in February and March 2015. This continued until 3 February 2016 when the accused failed to respond any longer to PW1.

41     During this time, the accused had misrepresented to PW1 the status of his orders. While the accused testified that he told Antanov to stop delivery after May or June 2015, he failed to disclose this to PW1. Instead, he continued to give the impression that the orders would be fulfilled. He informed PW1 after June 2015 that he would check with his supplier about the toys ordered. On 3 October 2015, he told PW1 that a large shipment was being prepared by his supplier and that it was coming soon.[^15] The accused continued to inform PW1 right up to 29 November 2015 that he could make a delivery by the end of the year or thereabouts.[^16] The accused was clearly untruthful and evasive towards PW1, since by his own account he had already instructed Antanov not to deliver any more items.

42     The accused also agreed to give PW1 a refund if the items were not delivered before Christmas.[^17] However, on 26 December 2015, the accused informed PW1 that he could only make a refund towards the end of January 2016. When PW1 inquired about this on 1 February 2016, the accused replied on 3 February 2016 that he could only give the refund once the supplier passed him the money. The last communication between them was on 3 February 2016 when PW1 asked if the accused could transfer $500 to him as he needed it urgently for Chinese New Year, but the accused failed to respond. PW1 tried to message the accused’s handphone, but the accused also did not respond to him.[^18]

#### The accused was evasive with PW2 and became uncontactable

43     PW2 had ordered items from the accused between 19 December 2014 and 3 January 2015. The chat log between then is found at Exhibit P4.

44     When the accused failed to deliver the items, PW2 started to check with the accused on or around 24 February 2015. After much persistence on PW2’s part, the accused refunded him $212.50 for an _Igor_ figurine on or around 27 April 2015, and made another refund of $300 for _Hot Rod_ on or around 18 May 2015.[^19] However, Exhibit P4 shows that the accused was evasive about the delivery of other items when he was queried by PW2 as well as on the issue of refunds for the items he failed to deliver.

45     The accused failed to respond to PW2 from around 7 June 2015, despite being sent messages on 7 June 2015 and 22 August 2015. On 22 August 2015, the accused suddenly blocked PW2 from Facebook and became uncontactable. He also failed to contact PW2 to resolve the outstanding issues. His claim that he blocked PW2 as PW2 would message and call him at late hours, did not absolve him from contacting PW2 to resolve the issue of the outstanding orders.

## The accused failed to provide refunds

46     The accused’s evidence was that when Glenn Chan started spreading false rumours about him, this led to a mass cancellation of orders. The accused testified that at first he refunded his customers from his own pocket when they cancelled their orders. However, he stopped making refunds after Antanov told him:-

“You’re crazy. You are killing yourself. What about the stocks that’s coming? What I’m gonna do with it?”. Because a lot of them, the packagings are---are pretty huge. 1 figure is fine when you have a carton, 2 cartons, 3 cartons, 4 cartons that piling up is no joke. So he says “Stop refunding. Tell your customers we were sell off the items first or their slots then we refund them”. I---he told me that is the right thing to do.

47     The accused also testified that Antanov and he stopped dealing in watches as Antanov was very angry with him for giving refunds to those who had cancelled their orders.[^20] This was another inherently illogical bare allegation on the accused’s part. There would be no reason for Antanov to get angry with the accused as he had paid Antanov in full when the orders were placed. Further, in making refunds, he was using his own money (and not Antanov’s).[^21] There was also no evidence that pursuant to the alleged cancellations the accused had demanded that Antanov refund the money paid to him.

## The accused had the means to make refunds but failed to do so

48     While the accused was an undischarged bankrupt, he boasted that he had a safe which was full of cash and tendered a photograph to support his claim (Exhibit D3). He claimed that he and his wife had twice struck lottery from Singapore Pools. The first time was for $350,000 (in August 2012) and the second time was for $25,000 (in December 2015).[^22]

49     His claim that he was not able to give refunds due to a mass cancellation of orders was not credible as he had ample funds to do so. If he had been honest in his dealings with PW1 and PW2, he would have provided full refunds to them since he had informed Antanov not to make any more deliveries.

## Conclusion

50     The sole issue was whether the accused had cheated by dishonestly inducing PW1 and PW2 into transferring funds to his bank account on the false promise that he would deliver the toys to them.

51     “Dishonestly” is defined under s 24 of the Penal Code as follows:-

**“Dishonestly”**

24.    Whoever does anything with the intention of causing wrongful gain to one person, or wrongful loss to another person, is said to do that thing dishonestly.

52     By section 23 of the Penal Code, the meaning of “wrongful gain” or “wrongful loss” would be:-

**“Wrongful gain” and “wrongful loss”**

23.    “Wrongful gain” is gain by unlawful means of property to which the person gaining it is not legally entitled; “wrongful loss” is loss by unlawful means of property to which the person losing it is legally entitled.

Explanation —A person is said to gain wrongfully when such person retains wrongfully, as well as when such person acquires wrongfully. A person is said to lose wrongfully when such person is wrongfully kept out of any property, as well as when such person is wrongfully deprived of property.

53     There was no direct evidence to show whether the accused had been dishonest in that he had wrongfully gained by wrongfully acquiring the funds which PW1 and PW2 transferred to him. The court’s finding that there was dishonest inducement on the part of the accused was based on circumstantial evidence which occurred after the events.

54     In summary, the circumstantial evidence was:-

(a)     The accused’s testimony that he had ordered the toys from Antanov was not credible. Even if he did so, there was no valid reason for him to stop delivery of the toys PW1 and PW2 ordered;

(b)     The accused did not have nor did he claim to have any other supplier for the toys which PW1 and PW2 ordered;

(c)     There was no evidence to show that the accused attempted to procure the toys which PW1 and PW2 ordered;

(d)     The accused’s reason for non-delivery of the toys i.e. mass cancellation of orders due to rumours spread about him was incredible;

(e)     In dealing with PW1 and PW2, the accused was untruthful and evasive and became uncontactable; and

(f)     The accused had the means to provide refunds to PW1 and PW2 but failed to do so.

55     Taking the circumstantial evidence in totality, the irresistible inference and the only conclusion the court could arrive at was that the accused had intended to cheat PW1 and PW2 when he dishonestly induced them to transfer funds to him for the purchase of the toys. He was dishonest in that by doing so, he had gained wrongfully.

56     By way of clarification, DAC 938553-2016 related to cheating with respect to $850 for 2 units of _Igor_. The funds for both units of _Igor_ were sent to the accused on or around 13 November 2014.[^23] The accused delivered one unit of _Igor_ on or around 6 June 2015, after many enquiries from PW1 and a request for a refund on 1 June 2015. Although delivery of one unit of _Igor_ was made, I was of the view that no amendment to the charge was necessary as PW1 had ordered 2 units of _Igor_ at the same time and as he expected delivery of both products.[^24]

## FINDING OF GUILT

57     For the reasons aforesaid, I found that the prosecution had discharged its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had committed the offences stated in the 8 charges. He was accordingly found guilty and convicted on all the charges.

## SENTENCE

58     The prescribed punishment for an offence under section 420 of the Penal Code is imprisonment which may extend to 10 years and liability to a fine.

59     The dominant sentencing principle in the present case would be deterrence.

## Antecedents

60     On 19 May 1994, the accused was convicted of an offence of cheating punishable under s 420 of the Penal Code and for a further offence of theft in dwelling punishable under s 380 of the Penal Code. He was sentenced to 4 months’ imprisonment per charge, with sentence to run concurrently.

## Aggravating factors

61     In submitting for a sentence of at least 3 months’ imprisonment per charge with 2 sentences to run consecutively, the prosecution pointed out that the accused was unremorseful and had mounted a spurious defence. It was an aggravating factor that he had used the internet to attract buyers and commit multiple offences.

62     The use of the internet to cheat members of the public has been recognized to be an aggravating factor. In _Public Prosecutor v Syamsul Hilal bin Ismail_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 973</span> (_“Syamsul”_), Chao Hick Tin, JA stated at \[36\]:-

In relation to the Prosecution’s submission, I accept that the use of the Internet is a relevant sentencing consideration in that there is a strong public interest to deter potential offenders from using that medium to reach a larger number of potential victims.

63     The fact that the accused was a serial cheat who had committed multiple offences against 2 victims was another aggravating factor.[^25]

## Plea-in-mitigation

64     The accused re-iterated the issues raised in his defence. He maintained that there was a vast conspiracy against him. He also reiterated that he could not deliver due to false internet rumours being spread about him. He further accused the trial DPP of committing perjury. He also asserted that he had exposed certain criminal elements in the Attorney-General’s Chambers and that he had experienced bias. He had highlighted all these issues to PM Lee.[^26]

## Sentencing precedents

65     The prosecution tendered a table of sentencing precedents which showed that substantial terms of imprisonment were imposed even when relatively small amounts were involved where the internet was used as a means to cheat the victims.

66     For example, in _Syamsul_, the offender was sentenced to two months’ imprisonment per charge when the amounts cheated in a scam which involved false car rental deals were between $50 to $350. The offender was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 5 months per charge when he collected amounts ranging from $40 to $2000, when he falsely claimed that he could help the victims arrange loans.

## Consideration of Sentence

67     In sentencing the accused, I did not place weight on his antecedents since they were dated and committed about 20 years before his current offences. However, he could not be regarded as a first offender. The accused was also not remorseful and had elected to claim trial. He was therefore not entitled to any sentencing discount associated with a timely plea of guilt.

68     There were no significant mitigating factors in the accused’s favour, since his mitigation consisted of re-asserting his claim that others had conspired to harm him. I noted however that for DAC 938553-2016 he had delivered one _Igor_ figurine costing $425 and sentencing for this charge was done on the basis that PW1 had suffered a loss of the remaining $425 he paid.

69     As for the aggravating factors, I took into account the fact that the accused had used the internet as a medium to commit the offences and that he had committed 8 offences against 2 victims.

70     Having considered the sentencing precedents tendered by the prosecution, I was of the view that a sentence of imprisonment of 3 months per charge was appropriate. I also ordered the sentences in two of the charges to run consecutively, so that the accused would serve a total of 6 months’ imprisonment.

71     In totality, a sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment was proportionate to the offences which the accused had committed.

72     The prosecution elected to withdraw the remaining 40 stood down charges and the accused was granted a discharge amounting to an acquittal on those charges.
