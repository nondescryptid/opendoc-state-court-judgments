### District Judge Marvin Bay:

## INTRODUCTION

1       The appeal against sentence in this case was filed in rather atypical circumstances. The accused; Melis Hendrikus Dirk Maria (“Mr Melis”), pleaded guilty on 20 February 2020 (a Thursday), _via_ a video conferenced mention, to a number of proceeded charges. The most serious of these charges, and the only one appealed against, was one instance of causing **_grievous_** hurt to his wife, Elianna Kathleen Grace (“Ms Grace”), contrary to section 325 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.). The prosecution’s charge for this offence specified that Mr Melis “_did voluntarily cause grievous hurt to one Elianna Kathleen Grace, to wit, by punching her multiple times on her face, head and jaws, causing the said Elianna Kathleen Grace to suffer_ **_a fracture of nasal bone_**”

2       This injury was substantiated by a medical report by one Dr Diane Vano Raro of Tan Tock Seng Hospital who had indicated that the victim suffered a nasal bone fracture**_._** Mr Melis was sentenced to a term of six months and two weeks for the section 325 Penal Code charge**_._** On 24 February 2020, (the following Monday) I was made aware that counsel had procured a “Clarification Medical Report” from the said Dr Diane Vano Raro where she (Dr Raro) effectively recanted a critical aspect of her diagnosis in her earlier report that “_X rays of the facial bone revealed nasal bone fracture”_ to state instead that in respect of Ms Grace’s injuries, “_X rays of the facial bone revealed_ **_no_** _fracture”_.

3       As the “Clarification Medical Report” was only made known to me some **_two_** working days **_after_** the accused had been sentenced, I was unable to exercise the powers provided under section 301 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Chapter 68, 2012 Rev Ed), and thus effectively _functus_ for resentencing Mr Melis, or amending the charge. Section 301 of the Criminal Procedure Code provides that

> 301.—(1) Where a court has delivered its judgment, it may rectify a clerical error at any time, and any other error, including an error in the exercise of its sentencing powers, may be rectified by the court **_by the next working day_** after the delivery of the judgment. \[emphasis added\].

4       The only recourse was for a criminal revision to be filed to rectify the situation of Dr Raro’s subsequent medical report rendering the conviction in the guilty plea to have been made upon a premise now shown to be erroneous. This is to say that the charge ought not have been one under section 325 of the Penal Code as the victim, according to Dr Raro’s later medical report, did **_not_** actually suffer a nasal fracture. As the Prosecution had been relying on the definition of grievous hurt provided by s320 (g), which provides

> 320 - The following kinds of hurt only are designated as “grievous”:

>> …

>> (g)    fracture or dislocation of a bone;

Mr Melis thus ought, on these subsequently discovered facts, to have instead been charged with causing hurt _simpliciter_ under section 323 of the Code.

5       As Mr Melis was, by that juncture, serving the sentence which had been backdated to his first remand date of 23 November 2019, the appeal against sentence was filed to allow Mr Melis to be granted bail pending appeal. The accused had been released on bail after the incidents on 20 September 2019, which had formed the basis for the three charges against him, but had reoffended, and was thus held with no bail from 23 November 2019. There did not appear to be any provision for a District Court to grant a stay of a backdated sentence pending criminal revision. Upon my request for information, I had received a notification from Singapore Prison Service that Mr Melis’ earliest date of release was 7 April 2020. There was thus a valid concern that if he had continued serving his sentence, the application for criminal revision might be rendered nugatory as Mr Melis might have completed his sentence by then. The amended Notice of Appeal filed on 3 March 2020 indicates that the appellant is appealing **_only_** against the sentence imposed for the section 325 Penal Code charge.

6       I will now go to the sequence of events and state the salient facts of this case. The charge, statement of facts and mitigation plea are set out _verbatim_, with no paraphrasing to allow a better appreciation of the context upon which Mr Melis was convicted and sentenced.

## THE COURT PROCEEDINGS ON 20 FEBRUARY 2020

### The charge

7       This was the charge that is the present subject of Mr Melis’ appeal:

> You, **Melis Hendrikus Dirk Maria**

> are charged that you, on the 20th day of September 2019 at or about 09.20pm, at (_residential address_), did voluntarily cause grievous hurt to one Elianna Kathleen Grace, to wit, by punching her multiple times on her face, head and jaws, **_causing the said Elianna Kathleen Grace to suffer a fracture of nasal bone_** and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 325 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (Rev. Ed. 2008).

> \[emphasis added\]

### Statement of Facts

8       The accused confirmed his intent[^1] to plead guilty to the three proceeded charges, (The other two charges were DAC-926683-2019 which was a charge under s 353 of the Penal Code and MAC-911672-2019 a charge under s 6(3) of the Protection from Harassment Act.) with defence counsel confirming[^2] that his client understood the nature and consequences of his plea, Mr Melis admitted to the following Statement of Facts[^3] without any qualification.

> 1.    The accused is Melis Hendrikus Dirk Maria, (_personal particulars_), of (_residential address_). He is unemployed.

> FACTS RELATING TO 5th CHARGE (DAC-933203-2019)

> _Voluntarily Causing Grievous Hurt under Section 325 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224_

> 2.    The first victim is Elianna Kathleen Grace, F/38 years old. She is the wife of the accused.

> 3.    On 20 September 2019, the first victim returned home in the evening with their two daughters after picking them up from school. The accused was at home sleeping in the master bedroom after consuming alcohol in the afternoon.

> 4.    At about 08.30pm, one of their daughters began making noise at home. The accused woke up due to the noise. He approached their daughter and held her up to discipline her. The first victim stopped the accused and asked him to put their daughter down. The accused put their daughter down and approached the first victim.

> 5.    The accused used his hand to strangle the first victim by squeezing her neck. The first victim broke free and went to the kitchen, picking up an iron which was there. The first victim warned the accused to keep away, but the accused approached her. The first victim picked up a wooden spoon in the kitchen and hit the accused on his head a few times. The accused managed to snatch the spoon away.

> 6.    The accused then punched the first victim multiple times on her face, head and jaws. At this stage, the first victim was not strong enough to retaliate and tried in vain to protect her face from the accused’s blows.

> 7.    After a short while, the accused ended the attack and went back to the master bedroom to sleep.

> 8.    As a result of the blows from the accused, the first victim sustained various physical injuries to her face, such as bruises, abrasions and cephalohematoma. **_An X-ray revealed that the first victim suffered a nasal bone fracture as well._** The injuries are described in the medical report from Dr Diane Vano Raro of the Tan Tock Seng Hospital’s Emergency Department.

> 9.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence of Voluntarily Causing Grievous Hurt under Section 325 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

> FACTS RELATING TO 1st CHARGE (DAC-926683-2019)

> _Using Criminal Force to deter a public servant from discharge of his duty under Section 353 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224_

> 10.    The second victim is Wong Ye Ting Felicia, F/24 years old. She is a police officer.

> 11.    The first witness is Mok Heng Ngee, M/44 years old. He is a Voluntary Special Constable.

> 12.    The second witness is Khairul Nizham Bin Roslan, M/28 years old. He is a paramedic.

> 13.    The third witness is Ashlyy Bin Ashmadi, M/20 years old. He is a paramedic.

> 14.    On 20 September 2019 at about 09.40pm, the second victim and witnesses had attended at the home of the first victim and the accused.

> 15.    The accused was resting in the master bedroom. The accused then tried to get out of the master bedroom and enter the room where the first victim was being attended to. The second victim and first witness tried to calm the accused down and stop him from leaving his master bedroom that he was in. The accused turned aggressive and pushed the second victim on her chest once to get her out of his way.

> 16.    The accused pushed the second victim intending to deter her from discharging her duty as a public servant. The accused has thereby committed an offence of Using Criminal Force to deter a public servant from discharge of her duty under Section 353 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

> FACTS RELATING TO 3rd CHARGE (MAC-911672-2019)

> _Insulting a public servant under Section 6(3) of the Protection from Harassment Act, Chapter 256A_

> 17.    The third victim is Muhammad Ameer Syafiq Bin Abu Bakar, M/21 years old. He is a police officer.

> 18.    The witness is Muhamad Izar Bin Ayob, M/38 years old. He is a police officer.

> 19.    On 20 September 2019 at about 10.00pm, the accused was arrested by the third victim and witness for his attack upon the second victim. During the arrest, the accused was not compliant and hurled vulgarities including ‘_F--king Malay_’ at the third victim.

> 20.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has thereby committed an offence of Insulting a public servant under Section 6(3) of the Protection from Harassment Act, Chapter 256A.

### Consent for TIC for stood down charges and antecedents

9       Upon conviction, Mr Melis also signalled his consent for five stood down charges to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. Four of these charges involved theft of alcoholic beverages contrary to section 380 of the Penal Code, and the fifth involved a charge under section 6(3) of the Protection from Harassment Act, where the accused had abused a female police officer on 20 September 2019, after the officer had attended at the scene of his assault on his wife, some ten minutes after the event. The accused had recent salient antecedents, to which he freely admitted[^4]. These unfortunately included offences within the exact _genre_ of his present offences. Mr Melis had on 29 January 2019, been sentenced to a term of one-week imprisonment for causing hurt to an individual who had been surreptitiously filming his erratic driving (The accused had been under the influence of alcohol at the time). He had, in that instance, received a global imprisonment term of three-weeks’ imprisonment, a fine of $4500 and a driving disqualification for 48 months for the proceeded offences. Mr Melis had then also consented to two charges under section 3(2) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A 2015 Rev Ed) being taken into consideration for sentencing purposes.

### Mitigation plea

10     I will delve onto the prosecution’s sentencing address later in these grounds as this will allow me to a platform to elaborate on the basis for the sentence imposed for his grievous hurt charge. For completeness, I will juxtapose that sentence with sentences imposed for the lesser charge of hurt _simpliciter_ (which would have been the proper charge for Mr Melis had the true nature of Ms Grace’s injuries been known)_._ I will now proceed to set out the Plea in Mitigation[^5] in its entirety and in _verbatim_. The written Plea states:

> 1.    We act for Melis Hendrikus Dirk Maria (_address_). Our client is a 36-year-old from Netherlands, who is married with 2 children.

> 2.    Our client is pleading guilty to charges 1, 2 and 4 and pursuant to Prosecution’s offer with the remaining charges to be taken into consideration.

> The charges are set out below for easy reference.

> Charge 1: Using Criminal Force to deter a public servant from discharge of his duty under Section 343 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224

> Charge 2: Insulting a public servant under Section 6(3) of the Protection from Harassment Act, Chapter 256A

> Charge 4: Voluntarily Causing Grievous Hurt under Section 325 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224

> 3.     **_Our client does not deny the offence. Our client has made a terrible mistake. He has also pleaded guilty to the offence_**. He pleads for leniency and we set out the mitigating factors for Your Honour’s consideration.

> **Mitigating Circumstances**

> 4.    Our client has a past medical record from IMH which states that he is suffering from Alcohol Use Disorder, whereby his pattern of alcohol intake would significantly impair or distress his state of being. A copy of the report has been enclosed on pages 3 to 6.

> 5.    His wife, who is also the victim in his 4th charge, has also provided a written statement and affirmed that **_she did not feel the impact of the alleged nasal bone fracture that was indicated in her medical report from Tan Tock Seng Hospital._** A copy of the statement has been enclosed on pages 7 and 8. A copy of the radiology report from Tan Tock Seng Hospital has been enclosed as well on page 9

> 6.    Our client has a young family with 2 daughters who are only turning 3 and 5 respectively. He has been working in Singapore only for a short period, yet has troubles in securing one due to his circumstances. He wishes to have a closure to this matter as soon as possible for him to return to his young children and spend some meaningful time with them and also to get a job.

> 7.    Thus, it is our fervent prayer that you would consider our client’s personal justifying and mitigating circumstances as stated above in meting out the minimal sentence possible.

> 8.    Our client has also been in remand since 23 November 2019. We pray that Your Honour backdates the sentence from the date of remand.

> \[emphasis added\]

11     The Mitigation Plea primarily alluded to Mr Melis’ unrestrained alcohol use and the stressor of his chronic unemployment to be the principal causes of his criminal acts. The plea did not, of course, contain any qualifying element of course, as counsel had not yet received the “Clarification Medical Report”. There was some indication of the victim-wife’s reservation that she had not “_felt the impact of the alleged nasal bone fracture_”. Counsel revealed that the victim had sought a clarification but disclosed that they[^6] had read an **_“X-ray report”_** which had alluded to the presence of “_a possible fracture_”. They (I understood counsel’s reference of _‘They’_ to refer to counsel and the victim-wife of the accused, since the accused was in remand at the time) had conceded the point and not waited for the clarification as they had fully expected that the pending report would **_“obviously”_** say **_“it is still a fracture”.[^7]_**

>   
| 

Magendran:

 | 

His wife is the victim…And she has also written---given a statement---to say that she did not really suffer the nasal bone fracture.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

I understand.

 |
| 

Magendran:

 | 

So, we in fact wrote to the hospital, to get a---clarification but we could not get it in time.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Magendran:

 | 

**_But instead we got the X-ray report which-says a possible fracture._**

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Magendran:

 | 

**_And obviously, the medical report says it is still a fracture._**

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

It is technically a fracture but…what you’re saying is that in terms of the fracture, the fracture is not a particularly severe fracture.

 |
| 

Magendran:

 | 

**_Yes_** _._

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Understand. Go on please.

### Counsel’s application at PTC to clarify injury before the PG mention

12     If I may _segue_ for a moment to explain the context for counsel’s seeming equivocation before he conceded to there being a documented fracture. As the contents in the written Plea in Mitigation would suggest, Mr Elianna Kathleen Grace, the accused’s wife had vocalised her reservations about suffering a nasal fracture, and this was documented in the PTC minutes on 16 December 2019 and 13 January 2020. There thus appeared, from the defence’s perspective, to be two competing considerations in this case. One had been to quell the victim-wife’s misgivings regarding her documented nasal fracture. While this was important, the defence was also keen for Mr Melis to be expeditiously sentenced as the accused had been in remand since 23 November 2019. This is quite evident from \[3\] of counsel’s letter dated 28 February 2020, he states: “_Our client had instructed us to proceed with the PG mention as he had been in remand for almost 3 months_.” As such an expeditious sentencing would ensure that his time served in remand would not outstrip the imposed term of the final sentence, with backdating and remission factored in. Mr Melis’ entitlement to a sentence remission is as provided by Section 50I of the Prisons Act (Cap 247 2000 Rev Ed) which provides:

> 50I.—(1)    The Commissioner shall make a remission order in respect of a prisoner —

>> (a)    unless paragraph (b) applies, on the day after the day the prisoner has served whichever of the following that ends later:

>> (i)    two-thirds of all the consecutive terms of imprisonment to which the prisoner was sentenced;

>> (ii)   14 days of his sentence…

13     In respect of the first consideration to resolve doubts that injury that Ms Grace suffered included a nasal fracture, Mr Magendran had conveyed the defence’s desire for such clarification in mid-January 2020. The request for clarification was after the investigation officer had filed Dr Raro’s first report indicating the existence of a nasal fracture, in response to the victim-wife’s misgivings, which were communicated on 16 December 2019. Subsequently, the mentions court minute sheet from Court 4A on 13 January 2020 indicated defence counsel’s application for an adjournment for him to “_clarify with hospital if_ (the victim) _suffered a nasal bone fracture TMR_ (ie _to make representations_)”

14     At the next mention on 10 February 2020, the police prosecuting officer in attendance had indicated that the parties were ready to take a plea. Noting counsel’s prior application and the prosecuting officer’s rather peremptory response, the court had entered the following to the minutes of proceedings:

> IO received DC representations on 10/01/2020, DC requested for detailed X-ray report and clarification report. **_IO had informed DC that it is DC responsibility to request the said report as DC is the one seeking clarification. DC to update status._**

> \[emphasis added\]

### Address by accused’s wife at PG mention

15     Returning to the PG mention on 20 February 2020, I had, in an abundance of caution, and with a view to ascertaining if the Ms Grace had any further misgivings, allowed the victim-wife an opportunity to address the court. Ms Grace had made such an application, and the DPP had not objected to the same. Ms Grace in her address[^8] had blamed herself that she had “_aggravated the quarrel even bigger_(sic)”[^9] by hitting the accused in the course of their struggle and expressed her difficulties in coping as she was the sole working parent.

16     Ms Grace had questioned the hospital diagnosis of a nasal fracture, as she had not received any follow-up treatment, which she, a staff nurse, would have expected to be given for such an injury. I had checked with counsel to ascertain that there was no change in the defence’s position[^10].When asked, Mr Magendran confirmed that he was not disputing that there was clinical evidence of a fracture.

### Sentences imposed

17     Accordingly, I had. after brief sentencing remarks where I had pointed out the ruinous path that Mr Melis’ misuse of alcohol had taken him, and urged the accused to exercise temperance for the sake of his young family, imposed the following sentences:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="16.12%"> <col width="55.02%"> <col width="28.86%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Charge</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Offence</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Sentence</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-926683-2019</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Section 353 Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Eight (8) weeks' imprisonment.

18     I ordered the sentences in DAC-933203-2019 and MAC-911672-2019 to run consecutively, with the term imposed in DAC-926683-2019 to run concurrently, yielding a global term of six months' and three weeks' imprisonment. The sentence was also backdated to Mr Melis’ first remand on 23 November 2019. With this backdating, Mr Melis’ earliest date of release would have been 7 April 2020, had he not been released on bail on 28 February 2020,

## THE MEDICAL REPORTS

### The initial report

19     Only one medical report documenting the injuries of Mr Melis’ spouse was placed before the court for the PG mention on 20 February 2020. The report by Dr Diana Vano Raro, which was addressed to Ang Mo Ki Police Division HQ, stated:

> MEDICAL REPORT ON: ELIANNA KATHLEEN GRACE

> \[emphasis added\]

### The “Clarification Medical Report”

20     The second report by Dr Raro was the “Clarification Medical Report”, which came enclosed with a letter from counsel dated 21 February 2020. Both documents are set out below with the letter from counsel first:

> Our ref: ALC.2018.319(A)MHD.MISC.dk

21     Dr Raro’s enclosed letter, dated 14 February 2020, stated:

> Our ref: ALC.2018.319(A)MHD.MISC.dk

> ARASAN LAW CHAMBERS

> For your information,

> Thank you.

> DIANE VANO RARO (DR)

> EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT

> TAN TOCK SENG HOSPITAL

> \[emphasis added\]

22     Given that Dr Raro appeared to have reversed her medical opinion in a critical aspect of her initial medical report, the fact that the “Clarification Medical Report” comprised just a single substantive line that tersely stated “**_X-rays of the facial bone revealed no fracture_**” inevitably raised more questions than answers.

23     I had scheduled an urgent mention in the afternoon of 24 February 2020, after the letter and the “Clarification Medical Report’ had been brought to my attention earlier that day.

24     Counsel explained that he had, in early January 2020, first asked the investigation officer to assist in resolving his client’s misgivings regarding her nasal fracture, and had written to Ang Mo Kio police division to ask for a clarification[^11]. The investigation officer had simply called him back to state that “_they are satisfied with the report_:[^12] and thus would not be minded to embark on any inquiry for clarification. Mr Magendran had thus taken it on himself to obtain a clarificatory report by corresponding with Tan Tock Seng Hospital. He had on 13 October 2020 received a copy of the initial report which the police had previously obtained, which specified that Ms Grace had suffered a nasal fracture[^13]. Counsel had persisted with another letter to the hospital _“setting out the parameters_” of their inquiry and stating Ms Grace’s reservations about her nasal fracture. Counsel indicated that he had finally received a response from the hospital by way of the “Clarification Medical Report” in the afternoon of 21 February 2020 (which was a Friday), and had sought to file the response into the State Court’s Integrated Case Management System (ICMS) where _inter alia_, documents intended for court proceedings can be filed, but could not do so as his law firm did not appear to be registered[^14] presumably because his firm was not predominantly engaged in criminal cases. He had subsequently attempted to serve the letter and report by hand in the late afternoon/early evening of that day.

25     Upon my inquiry, Mr Magendran could not tell if the one-line response from Dr Raro signified that there had been a typographical error in the original report or if there had, rather, been a substantive mistake of diagnosis[^15]. He was candid in conceding that “**_We were equally shocked to receive that reply_**” albeit that he found this this to be a “_pleasant surprise_”[^16].

26     DPP Sunil Nair was unable to offer any views as he was not in a position “_to confirm whether the later letter (_ie the “Clarification Medical Report”) _is accurate_” as “_the investigation officer had not spoken to the doctor yet_”. He stressed the need to investigate further as he had understood that Ms Grace had approached the doctor concerned and spoken directly to that doctor, and that the propriety of this consultation had to be looked at. DPP Sunil conveyed his suspicion in the following terms[^17] (_interjections and pauses in the transcript, which had no bearing in the content, have been edited off for clarity_):

> Your Honour, one more point. I understand…that the---the accused’s wife had…attended at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, speak to the doctor in question prior to the new report being issued. So perhaps, some clarity as to what was discussed at the meeting…

27     I was of the view that the full circumstances of Dr Raro’s hitherto unexplained about-turn ought be properly investigated and therefore gave an adjournment to allow the DPP some time to obtain a more detailed report to explain the terse “Clarification Medical Report”.

### The final TTSH report

28     The third report from TTSH, dated 27 September 2018, was procured by AG’s Chambers. The report, which supplied the much needed contextual and expository information to explain how and why Dr Raro had authored two discrepant medical reports, was authored by Dr Ang Hou, a Senior Consultant who headed TTSH’s Emergency Department. The report states:

> 27 February 2020

> Mr Francis Ng

> Deputy Chief Prosecutor

> Attorney General’s Chambers

> Through: A/Prof Chin Jing Jih

> Chairman Medical Board

> Tan Tock Seng Hospital

> Re: Clarification report for Elianna Kathleen Grace

> _(Identification number)_

> I write to clarify the discrepancy in the medical report written by Dr Diana Vano Raro to Ang Mo Kio Police Division HQ (Ref: F/20190920/148) which was copied to Arasan Law Chambers (Ref ALC.2018.319()) dated 3 Feb 2020. The medical report stated that the x-ray of the facial bone revealed nasal bone fracture.

> A subsequent clarification report written by Dr Diane Vano Raro (Ref: 2020-15780-0) dated 14 February 2020 to Arasan Law Chambers stated that the x-rays of the facial bone revealed no fracture.

> I have spoken with Dr Diane Vano Raro with regards(_sic_) to this discrepancy.

> She received a request for clarification from Arasan Law Chambers dated 6 February 2020 stating that Mdm Eliana claimed not to have suffered any nasal bone fracture,

> Dr Diane wrote the initial report based on the x-ray report.

> **_The formal facial bone x-ray report states_**:

> **_There is fragmentation of the nasal bone. Please correlate clinically for possible fracture here_**. No other fracture seen. The visualised paranasal sinuses are clear.

> However, upon request for clarification, she noted the clinical notes had an entry at the end by the second attending doctor, Dr Michelle Dizon Cruz, stating that the facial x-ray report was noted but upon review of the patient, there was no nasal bone deformity nor tenderness, not septal haematoma. The clinical entry by the previous attending doctor, Dr Tan Yan Yu, also did not highlight any complaints over the nose or document any external nasal injury.

> **_I would indicate that the initial medical report of a nasal bone fracture was inaccurate._**

> I have clarified with Dr Gregory Kaw, Head and Senior Consultant of Diagnostic Radiology Tan Tock Seng Hospital. As the x-ray taken was not a dedicated nasal bone x-ray, **_the presence of a nasal bone fracture is indeterminate._**

> **_In conclusion, it is unlikely that Mdm Elianna suffered a nasal bone_** fracture as there were no complaints with regards(_sic_) a nasal injury and the examination by both attending doctors did not support such an injury,

> We apologise to the Court for any confusion caused by the discrepancy in the medical report and the subsequent clarification.

> Yours sincerely,

> Dr Ang Hou

> Head and Senior Consultant

> Emergency Department

> Tan Tock Seng Hospital

## IMPLICATIONS OF ERROR IN MEDICAL REPORT

### How Dr Raro and defence counsel were misled by the x-ray report into accepting that there had been a nasal fracture

29     Simply put, **_both_** Dr Diane Vano Raro and defence counsel had been misled by simply reading the X ray report, which had made reference to there being an apparent ‘_fragmentation of the nasal bone’_ and had urged attending doctors to_‘correlate clinically for possible fracture’ at that site._ Dr Raro had missed out on the **_negative_** findings of two doctors; Dr Michelle Dizon Cruz and Dr Tan Yan Yu, who, upon examination of Ms Grace, did not find any such fracture at the site, when she (Dr Raro) had penned her initial medical report.

30     Mr Magendran had been similarly misled, when he upon reading the x-ray report, taken cognisance of the annotation, and conceded during the hearing on 20 February 2020 that the x-ray report had pointed to _“a possible fracture”_ He had ended his quest for clarification as he had expected the pending clarification report to also confirm the fracture.

31     Mr Magendran had, with this expectation, not objected to the PG mention proceeding with Mr Melis’ guilty plea despite not having received the clarification report. Consequently, his mitigation had proceeded on the basis that Mr Melis had indeed caused such a fracture but had not caused much discernible pain when he inflicted the injury. To recap, at \[5\] of the Plea in Mitigation counsel had stated ‘(Ms Grace) _affirmed that she did not feel the impact of the alleged nasal bone fracture that was indicated in her medical report from Tan Tock Seng Hospital_. Essentially both Dr Raro and Mr Magendran had failed to note the **_caveat_** in the x-ray report that, before a final determination could be made, a clinical examination on the victim-patient was necessary to confirm or exclude the existence of the apparent fracture visualised from the facial x-ray.

### The original grievous hurt charge cannot stand

32     Defence counsel, in his letter dated 28 February 2020 entitled “_Re: Sentence Revision_”, sought to argue that given the fact that the court had been unaware of the true nature of the victim-wife’s injuries, the court should still be entitled to revisit its decision and **_directly_** rectify the sentence notwithstanding that more than one working day had elapsed when I saw parties on 24 February 2020. I viewed the argument to be untenable as this would run against the clear provisions of section 301 of the Criminal Procedure Code. As I had stated earlier, it is abundantly clear that the framed grievous hurt charge cannot stand, and as far as I accept that I am _functus officio_ as far as the finality of the length of the imposed sentence is concerned, a criminal revision would be necessary to rectify Mr Melis’ conviction from a charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt to a simple hurt charge, with the lesser charge very probably justifying a lighter sentence.

33     The sentencing principle of adjusting severity of punishment according to the gravity of the charge is, to say the least, well established, and is, within the context of the dichotomy between hurt and grievous hurt, patently illustrated in the case of _Chang Yam Song_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGHC 142</span>, where Yong Pung How CJ states at \[47\]:

> 47    The other aggravating factor which the district judge should have considered was the fact that the appellant was charged under s 325 of the Penal Code, rather than under s 323. It is evident from the different penalties prescribed in these two sections that s 325 is the more serious offence. Although the injury which Chua suffered, being a fracture of a bone, was “grievous” by virtue of the definition of “grievous hurt” in s 320(g), it was not a foregone conclusion that the appellant would therefore be charged under s 325 as opposed to s 323. In _Agmir Singh v PP_ Magistrate’s Appeal No 342 of 1992 (unreported) and _PP v Gopal Maganathan_<span class="citation">\[2001\] SGDC 310</span> (unreported) for instance, where the injury caused was likely a fracture of the nasal bone, the accused persons were only charged with voluntarily causing hurt under s 323. The accused in _Agmir Singh v PP_ was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment, and the accused in _PP v Gopal Maganathan_, who was a first offender, to two months’ imprisonment. In the present case in contrast, the appellant was charged under s 325 and not s 323. **_The sentence imposed on him therefore had to reflect the greater severity of the former offence. Accordingly, I increased the appellant’s sentence of imprisonment from three months to six months_**.

> \[emphasis added}

34     The converse situation is applicable here, where a grievous hurt charge is replaced with one of simple hurt. The proposition would, of course, apply _a fortiori_ where the very basis for reducing the charge would be because of a subsequent discovery that the nature of injuries suffered by a victim could no longer **_support_** the more serious charge.

### Basis for the term of the grievous hurt sentence imposed

35     Given that counsel has indeed filed an appeal against sentence, albeit for the atypical bases stated above, it would be appropriate for me to state how the sentence appealed against was arrived at. I will first explain the considerations involved for Mr Melis’ sentence of six months and two weeks’ imprisonment in respect of the section 325 Penal Code charge, and then, for the purpose of completeness, juxtapose this with my approach to sentencing on a section 323 charge, premised on the same injuries, absent the nasal fracture, to allow a sense of the sentence that Mr Melis **_ought_** to have received had the court been cognisant of Ms Grace’s true injuries at the date Mr Melis was sentenced.

36     DPP Sunil Nair had, in his sentencing submissions, presented a set of precedent cases to bolster his recommendation for a term of seven months’ imprisonment for the section 325 charge, He had brought to the court’s attention certain grievous hurt cases where nasal fractures had been caused, noting that the cases hovered around the six month range I have excluded **_unreported_** cases in the learned DPP’s compilation of grievous hurt cases involving nasal fractures, having borne in mind Sundaresh Menon CJ’s view in _Public Prosecutor v Siow Kai Yuan Terrene_ \[2020\]SGHC at \[86\] that “_unreported cases carry little if any precedential value because they are unreasoned_”. DPP Sunil observed that the six-month mark for such fractures was irrespective of whether the attack involved one or multiple punches (as was the case here). The most relevant of these cases are set out below (I should add that the descriptions of the cases differ from case summaries in the DPP’s sentencing submission as I have separately summarised and paraphrased the accounts after reading the grounds of decision of the respective cases, to highlight salient aspects).

37     In _Tan Xian Wen Danny_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGDC 459</span>, the accused had first disparaged the victim, who was in the presence of a female known to both men, at a pub in Clarke Quay. The accused had then proceeded to inflict a punch to the victim’s face after exiting a lift both had been travelling in. The female acquaintance had tried to intervene but been pushed away. The accused had then charged towards the victim again and inflicted a second punch in the face, causing a displaced nasal bone open fracture and nose laceration. The injuries required a _septo-rhinoplasty_ to correct the bony injuries which were causing nasal obstruction to the victim. The accused, who had Tan had antecedents for theft, drug and driving offences, received a **_six-month_** imprisonment sentence. His appeal against sentence was dismissed on 29 May 2015.

38     In _Chang Yam Song_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGHC 142</span> The victim approached the accused regarding a debt of six months’ standing that he (the accused) owed. The accused had reacted in a volatile manner by shouting and threatening the victim. The victim had then sought to disengage from the scene by walking away. The accused had continued accosting the victim and demanding to inspect a file of documents evidencing the debt, threatening to beat him up if he did not surrender the file. The two had then began a tussle for possession of the file, which culminated with the accused punching the victim and causing a nasal bone fracture. The accused, who had social disturbance and property-related offences, claimed trial. On appeal, the accused sentence was enhanced to six months’ imprisonment.

39     The case of _Public Prosecutor Samson Tanuwidjaja_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 228</span> (MA9102/2018/01-02) demonstrated that a significant uplift from the baseline of six months; imprisonment for typical assaults causing nasal fractures, in a situation where the accused had prosecuted a sustained attack causing considerable post-assault trauma. In this case, the victim had been a pub waitress who worked in Orchard Towers. The accused had repeatedly propositioned her while she was serving him drinks. When the victim left work, the accused who had been waiting for her outside the pub, and followed her an area in front of the Royal Thai Embassy, and approached her again. After she had rejected him for the fourth time, the accused had grabbed her arms, pushed her into some shrubbery at the scene, and punched her at least five times on her face and upper chest until she lost consciousness. The victim suffered facial contusions and lacerations, along with a displaced fracture of the tip of her nasal bone.

40     The accused there; in a parallel with Mr Melis in the instant case, was traced for drink driving. Unlike the present accused, _Samson Tanuwidjaja_ had claimed trial. Upon his conviction, he had been sentenced to six months’ imprisonment and ordered to pay compensation amounting to $635.75. On appeal, the accused’s sentence was enhanced to **_nine months’_** imprisonment. The distinguishing factor from the examples cited above would be the intensity and severity of the attack, and the emotional trauma suffered by the victim.

41     In the instant case, Mr Melis, who from the video-conference session on 20 February 2020, appeared to be an individual of robust and muscular build, had, like _Samson Tanuwidjaja_, mounted a vicious assault where he had thrown a series of punches on a lady of petit stature. Given that Mr Melis had inflicted no fewer than eight separate injuries to his victim’s face and torso, along with the erroneously documented nasal fracture, I was of the view that the learned DPP’s submission for a seven-month imprisonment term to be generally reasonable. Nevertheless, I did note Mr Melis’ early plea of guilt, and that despite having recent relevant antecedents, the accused had no other criminal history. While I had no doubt that Ms Grace had suffered some measure of emotional trauma, she had become an ardent advocate for leniency to be afforded to her husband. All considered, I was of the view that a minor downward titration of two weeks ought be granted, and thus imposed a sentence of six months’ and two weeks’ imprisonment.

### Basis for global sentence

42     In deriving the global sentence, I was mindful of the need to observe the Totality Principle[^18] The Totality Principle was articulated by Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon in _Logachev Vladislav_ v _Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 609</span>; <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 12</span>, where his Honour states at \[84\]:

> As to the content of the totality principle, this comprises two limbs. The first examines whether the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed, while the second considers **_whether the effect of the aggregate sentence on the offender is crushing and not in keeping with his past record and his future prospects_** (see _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP_<span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> (“_Shouffee_”) at \[54\] and \[57\] respectively). It has been said that the totality principle is one of limitation and is a manifestation of the requirement of proportionality that runs through the gamut of sentencing decisions (see _Shouffee_ at \[47\]). \[emphasis added\]

43     Section 307 of the Criminal Procedure Code provides that where a person is sentenced to imprisonment for three or more distinct offences, at least two sentences for these offences must be ordered to run consecutively. I accordingly ordered the section 325 Penal Code sentence to run consecutively with the **_shortes_**t sentence among the three proceeded charges[^19], this being the one-week imprisonment term for MAC-911672-2019, for the offence under section 6(3) of the Protection from Harassment Act. Mr Melis’ total sentence was thus six months and three weeks, which was backdated to his first remand of 23 November 2019. I was satisfied that this would not be a crushing sentence and would be congruent with Mr Melis’ past record and his future prospects.

### How the accused would have been sentenced but for the erroneous medical report

44     For the sake of completeness in these grounds, I now turn to consider the sentencing scenario that would have eventuated **_but for_** the erroneous aspect of the report by TTSH’s Dr Raro. I will take the remainder of the report to have correctly described Ms Grace’s injuries. Although not charged as such, Mr Melis’ admissions in the Statement of Facts would have amply fulfilled the defined action and intent “to voluntarily cause hurt” under section 321[^20] of the Penal Code. Section 321 of the Penal Code provides that:

> **_Whoever does any act with the intention of thereby causing hurt to any person_**, or with the knowledge that he is likely thereby to cause hurt to any person, and does thereby cause hurt to any person, is said “voluntarily to cause hurt”.

> \[emphasis added\]

### Applying the sentencing framework developed in Low Song Chye v PP

45     The guideline judgment of _Low Song Chye v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 526</span>; <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 140</span> (‘_Low Siong Chye’_) has provided a two-stage framework to lend coherence and consistency in sentencing within the inevitably vast taxonomy of bodily injuries that would fall within the ambit of “hurt” under section 323 of the Code. The framework now allows a systematic analysis where the diverse permutations of hurt have been collapsed into three distinct bands which focus on the extent of harm caused in terms of the **_actual_** injury inflicted, along with the amount of medical intervention, therapy and hospitalization required in the aftermath, to allow a _ballpark_ sensing of the applicable sentencing range, as a first step.

46     In _Low Siong Chye_, See Kee Oon J set out the following bands are for a first-time offender who had rendered a plead of guilt:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="8.26%"> <col width="68.46%"> <col width="23.28%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Band</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Hurt caused</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Indicative sentencing range</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Low harm: no visible injury or minor hurt such as bruises, scratches, minor lacerations or abrasions</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fines or short custodial term up to four weeks</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><em>Moderate harm: hurt resulting in short hospitalisation or a substantial period of medical leave, simple fractures, or temporary or mild loss of a sensory function</em></b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><em>Between four weeks’ to six months’ imprisonment</em></b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Serious harm: serious injuries which are permanent in nature and/or which necessitate significant surgical procedures</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Between six to 24&nbsp;months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

47     Upon the identification of the appropriate sentencing band to determine the applicable indicative sentencing range by considering the hurt caused by the offence, the court would be afforded an “_appropriate indicative starting point_”[^21].

48     The next stage would entail the sentencing count making the necessary adjustments to the indicative starting point sentence based on its assessment of the offender’s culpability as well as all other relevant factors. A deliberation of the aggravating and mitigating factors[^22] were relevant in this step.

49     The aggravating and mitigating factors are the same as those stated by the Court of Appeal in _Public Prosecutor v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 127</span>; <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 69</span>, although that case involved, _inter alia_ charges under section 325 of the Penal Code.

> A**_ggravating_** factors would include the following:

>> (a)       the extent of deliberation or premeditation;

>> (b)       the manner and duration of the attack;

>> (c)       the victim’s vulnerability;

>> (d)       the use of any weapon;

>> (e)       whether the attack was undertaken by a group;

>> (f)       any relevant antecedents on the offender’s part; and

>> (g)       any prior intervention by the authorities.

> **_Mitigating_** factors would include

>> (a)       the offender’s mental condition;

>> (b)       the offender’s genuine remorse; and

>> (c)       the offender’s personal financial or social problems.

50     It was conceivable that these factors could take the eventual sentence out of the applicable indicative sentencing range which had been earlier set in the prior analysis.

### Juxtaposing Low Siong Chye and the instant case

51     As a reference point for how I would have sentenced Mr Melis for the hypothetical voluntary hurt charge, I will sketch out the facts of _Low Song Chye_ to allow a comparison. The accused there was the manager in a karaoke pub where the offence had taken place. The victim had thrown pool balls around in an apparent tantrum. The accused pushed her towards the wall and grabbed her neck. He then slapped her with “_very great force_” on the left side of her face and her left ear. Subsequently, the accused grabbed the victim’s neck a second time. The victim maintained a modicum of resistance by throwing another pool ball towards the accused.

52     The victim was found, upon a medical examination, to have sustained. among other injuries, a left anterior central tympanic membrane perforation and mild conductive hearing loss. She later underwent a procedure to close the eardrum perforation. The victim, however, continued to suffer from mild conductive hearing loss in her left ear, together with persistent left-sided tinnitus. The prescribed treatment available for these conditions was a hearing aid. At the time of the trial, the victim had not obtained a hearing aid, but she did not have problems testifying in court without one.

53     Justice See Kee Oon assessed _Low_ to have caused moderate harm, and thus falling within Band 2 of the sentencing framework, noting that while the hearing impairment might persist for an indeterminate term, the hearing loss was mild. Holding the nature of this injury to be less serious than the cited precedents which involved nasal fractures, See J assessed the indicative starting point to be between two to three months’ imprisonment.

54     In analysing the second step of the framework to adjust the indicative sentence having regard to the offender’s culpability, as well as all relevant aggravating and mitigating factors, Justice See noted the injury to the victim have occurred as a result of single (albeit hard) slap, but also noted the accused’s subsequent acts of aggression, including the second time he grabbed the victim’s neck, which could ‘_properly be seen as part of the same altercation’_[^23]. Also relevant to this assessment was the victim’s throwing of pool balls at the accused, from which an element of provocation by the victim could be imputed.

55      _Low Siong Chye_ also had antecedents which _‘demonstrated a propensity for violence’[^24]_ on his part as seen by a recent antecedent in 2014, where he had been convicted of an offence under s 143 of the Penal Code and sentenced to three weeks’ imprisonment. After taking in the second-step considerations, the accused’s sentence was enhanced to a term of **_four months’_** imprisonment.

### Applying the framework to the instant case

56     Turning back to Mr Melis, I note that the accused had, like _Low Siong Chye_, begun the assault by pressing Ms Grace on her neck. Unlike _Low Siong Chye’s_ single forceful slap, Mr Melis had inflicted a series of blows around his wife’s face and torso. While Mr Melis had not wrought any injury which would have caused lasting debilitation, the hurt he inflicted was over an extensive area of Ms Grace’s face. I note that Mr Melis had inflicted no fewer than eight distinct injuries, where she had sustained bruising to the right side of her face, right cheek, right eye, right mandibular (lower jaw) area, a _cephalohaematoma_ (large swelling) on the occipital area of her skull, as well as abrasions on both lower and upper lips. Ms Grace also complained of discomfort to her left loin. The victim was not hospitalised but did receive five days’ medical leave. Indexing from the analysis in _Low Siong Chye_, I would also place the injuries inflicted by Mr Melis in the moderate range at **_band 2_**, with indicative punishments spanning from four weeks to six months imprisonment. There were no especially severe injuries, but the infliction of multiple less serious injuries over a wide area of Ms Grace’s face would merit, in my view, an imprisonment term of **_two months_**, which is at the lower end of that band.

### Assessment of culpability, aggravating and mitigatory factors

57     Proceeding to the next stage. I would note the salient aggravating and mitigating circumstances. In relation to culpability, Mr Melis’ assault was undoubtedly a sustained one. He had grabbed Ms Grace by the neck to throttle her and gone after her even after she had broken free of his grasp. He had persisted to attack her even after she had sought, in a bid to defend herself, to arm herself with an iron, and then a wooden spoon. It is telling that Mr Melis, who committed the assault on his wife at 9.20 pm on 20 September 2019, was still in a belligerent mood when police arrived at 9.40pm, as to push a **_female_** officer on her chest to demand that she get out of the way, and then cast racial slurs at a Malay officer at 10.00pm that night. Counsel was astute to avoid any references to Mr Melis’ consumption of alcohol prior to the incident. Ms Grace, however, did in her letter of 13 January 2020, which was addressed to the Registrar, State Courts and referenced in the Mitigation Plea , allude at \[2\] in her letter to Mr Melis being in an apparent state of intoxication when the events occurred, when she stated “_On 20th September 2019, when_ (Mr Melis) _was under the influence of alcohol, we had a major quarrel which ended with a domestic dispute…_” The High Court in _Wong Hoi Len v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 1 SLR(R) 115</span>; <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGHC 146</span> makes it quite plain that a sentencing judge should _ordinarily_ consider an offender’s intoxication as an **_aggravating_** consideration. If the facts showed that the offender’s intoxicated state during the encounter had, by itself, caused the victim to experience an increased state of terror or alarm, then that might be properly regarded as a **_further_** aggravating factor[^25]:

### Antecedent record and TIC charges show a worrying pattern of offending which call for specific deterrence

58     Another cogent aspect would be the unfortunate fact of Mr Melis’ very recent antecedents, which include a section 323 charge where a term of one week’s imprisonment was imposed. Also cogent would be the fact that Mr Melis’ had consented to five other charges being taken into consideration. In one of these charges, the accused had offended while on bail. DAC 932681-2019 involved a section 380 Penal Code charge, which was committed on 22 November 2019. Another of the TIC charges had involved Mr Melis shouting vulgarities at a female police officer, calling her a “_F—king Bitch_” on the night of 20 September 2019.

59     In a recent _ex-tempore_ Judgment in the case of _S Elamparithi v Public Prosecutor_ (MA 9238/2019). See Kee Oon J stressed that a sentencing court should carefully consider the interplay between proceeded and TIC charges, to enable the court to take a holistic view of the accused’s overall culpability, with a view to meting a truly condign punishment. In that case, the proceeded charge was one of voluntarily causing hurt where the accused has inflicted three slaps to a person, who had offered a degree of provocation. While the proceeded charge itself, on a “_stand-alone_” basis, would entail a non-custodial sentence, the presence of a TIC charge, also under section 323 of the Penal Code, where the accused had punched another person on a different date would show a “_worrying pattern of criminality_” which **_“_**_elevate_**_s_** (the accused person’s) _culpability and engages the need for specific deterrence where the custodial threshold is crossed_”.[^26] The accused was upon this heightened culpability, accordingly sentenced to a ten-day term of imprisonment.

60     For Mr Melis, who exhibited the same pattern of reoffending, I would find an **_uplift_** of one month’s imprisonment in addition to the two months’ imprisonment appraised from the first step to be justified. This would amount to an aggregate term of **_three months’_** imprisonment for the hurt charge. The uplift would take into account aspects of Mr Melis’ culpability in the light of the aggravating factors listed, as well as the need to impose a degree of specific deterrence to restrain Mr Melis’ concerning pattern of serial offending in circumstances often connected with his intake, or theft, of alcohol.

61     I would find the three month term entirely appropriate when a comparison is made with the sentence imposed in _Public Prosecutor v Fizul Asrul bin Efandi_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 475</span>; <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 119</span>. There the accused had driven his car into the leftmost lane of three-lane road, then stopped his car, turned off its engine and alighted, without switching on the car’s hazard lights. This act had blocked off one lane of traffic. The victim had later driven into the same lane without realising that the accused’s car was stationary. The victim attempted to reverse his car but had been blocked by a third car behind the victim’s car. When the accused returned, the victim sounded his horn. The accused had confronted the victim and challenged him to step out of his car. In the ensuing confrontation, the accused had spat at, and then punched the victim once on the face and knocked him to the ground. When the victim tried to call the police on his mobile phone, the accused had punched him again on the same part of the face, leaving the victim with a contusion at his right cheek, a superficial laceration in his buccal cavity and tenderness around his right hip.

62     Upon appeal, the prosecution succeeded in obtaining a 12-month disqualification term against the accused, with the **_16-week_** sentence imposed by the district judge for voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 of the Penal Code remaining undisturbed. I should add that the relatively higher sentence which the accused in this case received can be readily accounted for by the fact that he had had slightly worse antecedents than Mr Melis, having been sentenced to a term of eight weeks’ imprisonment for causing hurt in 2014. Also relevant would be the element of “road rage” dynamics leading to the altercation is also an added factor of aggravation, which did not apply in Mr Melis’ case.

### The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive

63     As I would have imposed only a three-month term of imprisonment on a section 323 Penal Code charge premised on the **_actual_** injuries that Mr Melis was found to have inflicted, the sentence of six months and two weeks imposed on the subsequently invalidated basis of the victim having suffered a nasal fracture under the section 325 grievous hurt charge could be regarded to be manifestly excessive. Counsel has undertaken to file a criminal revision with the High Court for the necessary rectifications to Mr Melis’ charge to allow for him to be appropriately resentenced.

64     Given the circumstances stated in the foregoing, I would be inclined to **_support_** counsel’s application for a criminal revision. In addition, given my analysis above, I had expressed a view that Mr Melis should have, on the lesser charge premised on less severe injuries, received a reduced sentence of no more than three months’ imprisonment, amounting to a global term of three months and one week in prison. This would (subject. of course, to the views of the High Court) effectively mean, with the taking into account of time served from first remand on 23 November 2019 to his release on bail on 28 February 2020, that Mr Melis might be entitled to be released without any additional remaining time to serve.

## POST-MORTEM

### Preventing ‘avoidable’ mistakes- Due care should be taken in completing medical reports

65     The circumstances described show that a series of avoidable missteps had occurred leading to the court’s unfortunate reliance on a flawed report, which had stated a non-existent injury that was fundamental to a charge preferred by the prosecution. Moving forward, I would like to highlight some areas of deficit in this case. The purpose is not to cast blame, but to minimise the possibility of any recurrence of the missteps that occurred in this case. The following are, in my view, areas that could be improved.

66     The doctor assigned to write the report; Dr Diane Vano Raro, was fully aware that two doctors had clinically examined Ms Elianna Kathleen Grace (having listed both their names and time of examination in her initial report), but had not checked with them on whether their direct examinations had indeed uncovered a nasal fracture, before penning her report. Her only source of information was an x-ray report which had made tentative observations of a facial x-ray scan taken of Ms Grace. She had consequently conflated a suspected diagnosis of a ‘_possible fracture_’ from the annotation in the x-ray report of a “_possible fracture_” to be confirmatory of an actual fracture to state “_X-ray on the facial bone revealed nasal bone fracture_” somehow having overlooked that the relevant passage had stated: “_There is fragmentation of the nasal bone. Please_ **_correlate clinically_** _for possible fracture here_”.

### Medical reports used in court proceedings should be final and correct

67     Moving forward, it is vitally important that medical professionals and other individuals supplying medical and scientific evidence realise the importance of their reports being **_final_** and **_correct_**, especially if the evidence is being used for criminal proceedings where the nature and extent of an injury is an important determining factor in sentencing, as was certainly the case here. In the case of offences against the person, bodily injuries form a critical (but not necessarily the sole) factor in the analysis of **_“harm”_** caused, and would consequentially lend considerable weight to the assessment of condign punishment in terms of length of imprisonment or caning strokes to be imposed, or indeed whether a threshold has been crossed to justify one, or both, of these punishments. The existence of these bodily injuries is usually proven through the expert opinion expressed in a medical report.

68     In _Khoo James and another v Gunapathy d/o Muniandy and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 SLR(R) 1024</span>; <span class="citation">\[2002\] SGCA 25</span> (“Gunapathy”), Yong Pung How CJ expressed that (at \[3\]):

> It would be pure humbug for a judge, in the rarified atmosphere of the courtroom and with the benefit of hindsight, to substitute his opinion for that of the doctor in the consultation room or operating chamber. We often enough tell doctors not to play god; it seems only fair that, similarly, judges and lawyers should not play at being doctors.

69     The jurisprudence from _Gunapathy_ onward has struck a clear dichotomy (which was elucidated in detail in _Ng So Kuen Connie_ v _Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 3 SLR(R) 178</span>; <span class="citation">\[2003\] SGHC 164</span> at \[22\]-\[28\]), where it is taken to be well within the court’s purview to make relevant findings of fact from presented scientific or technical evidence (such as the _mens rea_ of an accused person), but a judge should not inveigh on areas concerning _“scientific information that is outside the experience and knowledge of a judge”_ Essentially. judges are expected to be mindful of the limitations presented by their lack of formal training and experience in medical and scientist fields. Given this, medical reports are taken at **_face value_** in court proceedings, and are generally unchallenged, unless there has been a competing medical opinion by another medical expert for the court to assess.

70     A doctor should thus realise the **_primacy_** of the medical opinion that he renders to the court. This would especially be the case where the doctor asserts in a report that an injury or a condition exists because he has viewed an investigative scan or conducted a clinical examination on a victim of a crime. A court has neither the medical knowledge, nor any insight to the circumstances behind the preparation of these reports, to discern the soundness of the content of such reports and would thus be effectively blind to any mistakes and misdiagnoses in these reports. Medical professionals should thus be mindful of the concomitant responsibilities which come with a situation where the authoritative value of their reports is not readily open to question, and the **_trust_** reposed that they completely and accurately state the condition or injury which is of interest to the court, is virtually complete. Taking the instant case as an example; where there were eight separate injuries concentrated on the victim’s face in close proximity to her nose, there would have been no reason for a court to even **_suspect_** that the nasal fracture was documented in error.

71     Even where a victim registers any misgivings of her injury, she would be registering what would often appear to be her own **_subjective_** impression, as against the confidence reposed on there having been **_objective_** investigative scans, tests and clinical examinations backing any diagnosis stated in the medical report that the victim appears to be questioning or attempting to contradict.

### Closing the loop

72     Another fault line in this case was the fact that the **_loop was not closed_** as the defence had embarked on its own inquiry pursuant to the victim-wife’s reservations about her injury. The investigation officer had unfortunately paid scant interest to Ms Grace’s concerns, stating that he was _“satisfied”_ with Dr Raro’s initial report despite the fact that Ms Grace had been the victim and thus the very subject of the grievous hurt charge. To recap, the PTC minutes on 10 February 2020 state: “_IO received DC representations on 10/01/2020, DC requested for detailed X-ray report and clarification report._ **_IO had informed DC that it is DC responsibility to request the said report as DC is the one seeking clarification. DC to update status._**” \[emphasis added\]. Having the defence undertake the clarification as an “_ex-parte”_ expedition created a situation where **_only_** the defence was communicating with TTSH, with the hospital reciprocating by communicating exclusively with Arasan Law Practice. Along with Dr Vano’s “Clarification Medical Report”, counsel also exhibited email correspondences between TTSH and Arasan Law Practice dated 6 February 2020 and 7 February 2020, with neither AG Chambers nor the investigation officer being copied. This arrangement left the prosecution _‘out of the loop’_ and thus oblivious of the specific nature of any inquiries that the defence might be making.

73     Moving forward, given the integral importance of medical reports, I would, with respect, suggest that all parties in criminal proceedings be ‘_kept in the loop’_ on all developments where clarifications or fresh reports are sought. This would keep all eyes open, and alive to the possibility of any pending developments which might make it impracticable for a scheduled hearing to proceed. It would also be rational and reasonable for investigation officers to take a keen **_interest_** in any reservations of a medical diagnosis communicated by them by victims in offences they are investigating, even if they are related to the accused person. Failing to do so might leave the victim with a pervasive sense that their doubts have not been taken seriously, and their concerns not thoroughly investigated.

### Any mistake detected should be immediately communicated

74     A surprising aspect of this case was the fact that Dr Varo’s “Clarification Medical Report” was **_dated 14 February 2020_**, some six days before the hearing where Mr Melis rendered his plea of guilt. Counsel has stated that he had only received that report in the late afternoon of 21 February 2020. It is understood that the report was delivered only by **_post_**.

75     Moving forward, it would be imperative for doctors charged with the responsibility of expressing a medical opinion to communicate any misdiagnosis or error in a medical report immediately, and to all concerned parties in the proceedings.

### Present status of accused

76     Mr Melis is presently released on bail upon counsel’s application for bail pending the outcome of the appeal. As indicated above, counsel has undertaken to file a criminal revision to accompany these grounds.
