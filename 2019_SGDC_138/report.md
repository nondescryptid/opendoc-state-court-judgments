3 July 2019

### District Judge Hamidah Bte Ibrahim:

Do Thi Phuong (the accused), female, aged 35, claimed trial and was convicted on 1 count of making a false declaration under section 57(1)(k) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133) and punishable under section 57(1)(vi) of the said Act.

2       The offence was committed on 13 March 2014 at the Permanent Resident Services Centre, Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) located at the ICA Building, 10 Kallang Road when the accused submitted an Application for Permanent Residence in Singapore form. In this form, she declared that the particulars stated in the said form were true and correct and that she had not wilfully suppressed any material fact, when she stated in Part A of the said form that:

a)     Her present residential address in Singapore was Block 114, Bedok North St 2, #XXX, Singapore 460114 and

b)     That she was residing with the sponsor, Mat Peng Hwa, PW1, at the above address at the time of the application, which statements she knew to be false and as a result of her application, she obtained an entry permit granting her permanent residence on 30 June 2015.

3       The accused was sentenced to serve 8 weeks’ imprisonment. She is now appealing against her conviction and sentence.

## The Prosecution’s Case

4       The prosecution called a total of 7 witnesses to prove their case. The witnesses included 5 lay witnesses, the investigating officer and the Vietnamese interpreter.

#### Mat Peng Hwa (Mat), PW1

5       The first witness for the prosecution, Mat, testified that he was married to the accused on 4 May 2009 in Singapore. On the 28 September 2015, he and the accused were divorced in the Family Courts of Singapore. On the 11 April 2018 he had pleaded guilty to 1 charge of making a false statement on the 13 March 2014 to ICA, when he obtained an entry permit for the accused and declared in his capacity as a local sponsor that the accused’s address in Singapore was Blk 114, Bedok North Street 2, XXX, and he knew this was false. Mat was sentenced to serve 6 weeks’ imprisonment. The exhibits pertaining to his charge and the statement of Facts (SOF), which he admitted without qualification, was admitted as P1.

6       Mat testified that the accused was introduced to him by his friend whom he knew as Michael and whose real name is Wong Soon Cheng (Wong), PW3. This was sometime in 2009 and Michael asked him to enter into a sham marriage with the accused. This was to enable the accused to stay in Singapore. Mat agreed to do so since he was grateful for Michael’s help in times of need and he entered into the marriage with the accused, not out of love. The marriage was never consummated. In September 2009 the accused moved to stay in his home at Blk 114, Bedok North Street 2, XXX (the Bedok flat) with him and his mother. Sometime in June 2013, she left and stayed at Blk 58 Marine Terrace, #XXX(the Marine Terrace flat). Since then the accused did not return to stay in the Bedok flat. When she stayed in the Bedok flat, the accused would occupy the single bedroom and he and his mother slept in the living room.

7       When referred to P2, which is the accused’s application for permanent residence dated 13 of March, 2014, Mat agreed that he had signed the form when he made the declaration as her sponsor. Both he and the accused had used the services of a form writer to fill in P2. He had filled in the particulars of the Bedok flat as the residential address of the accused and declared that the accused was residing with him at the Bedok flat. This was incorrect as the accused was not staying in the Bedok flat with him on 13 March 2014. The form writer had explained the form both to him and the accused in Mandarin before they signed the form. Mat was aware that the accused has 2 children and said that Michael is the father of these 2 children.

8       During cross-examination, Mat agreed that pursuant to the divorce on 28 September 2015, he was ordered to pay maintenance of $500 per month to the accused being her maintenance and $600 per month for the 2 children. He had not been paying the maintenance.

#### Ah Moi (Mdm Ah Moi), PW2

9       Mdm Ah Moi is the mother of Mat, her only child. She identified the accused as one Ah Wen, a Vietnamese national, but she did not know the accused’s actual name. The accused had stayed in the Bedok flat together with her and her son. The accused and her son were friends and she was not sure whether they were married to each other. She did not know that the accused and her son were husband and wife. When the accused stayed in the Bedok flat she would sleep in the bedroom. The flat had 1 bedroom and a living room. Mdm Ah Moi and her son would sleep in the living room.

10     The accused had brought her 2 children to the Bedok flat to visit her after she had moved out. She did not know where the accused had moved to but she came back to visit her once. Mdm Ah Moi did not know who is the father of the 2 children. The accused had never informed her about the identity of the children’s father. The accused addressed her as “_auntie_”[^1].

#### Wong Soon Cheng (Wong), PW3

11     Wong described Mat as his friend and said that the latter had introduced him to the accused. Mat married the accused in May 2009. He was not present at the wedding as he was not invited. The accused and her 2 children are currently staying with him in his Pasir Ris flat. Wong said he fell in love with the accused in 2015 and as she needed a place to stay, he allowed her to stay with him.

12     In around May or June 2013, Mat had asked him to search for a place for the accused to stay as she needed a bigger space. He found the Marine Terrace flat and in May or June 2013 the accused moved into this flat. He signed the tenancy agreement for the Marine Terrace flat and opened the utility account for the flat in his name. She stayed in the Marine Terrace flat from June 2013 till July 2014. After leaving the Marine Terrace flat, the accused stayed in a flat in Tampines which was also sourced by him. When referred to the names of the 2 sons of the accused, Wong said that his name was included as part of their surname as Mat and the accused wanted him to be the godfather of the children. The children addressed him (Wong) as father. He was not sure whether he was the father of the 2 children.

#### Alan Ong Hui Yung (ASP Ong), PW4

13     ASP Ong is a senior processing executive with the Permanent Residence Services Centre (PRSC) of ICA which is in charge of the processing of applications for permanent residence. He was referred to P2, the application form for permanent residence submitted by the accused. ASP Ong said that there was a requirement for the applicant to indicate her present residential address. This would refer to the address that the applicant was residing as at the date of her application. In P2, the address stated was the Bedok flat. The residential address of an applicant is a material consideration during the assessment for permanent residence as the applicant and the sponsor are expected to be staying together. The application by the accused for permanent residence was approved by ICA on 30 June 2015.

#### Liew Shi Xiong (DSP Liew), PW5

14     DSP Liew is the investigating officer of the case. He had prepared the papers, including the SOF, when Mat pleaded guilty to his charge. His investigation revealed that the marriage between the accused and Mat was a sham marriage. Mat said that he is not the father of the 2 sons of the accused and that the surname ‘Wong’ in the birth certificates of the 2 sons refers to their biological father.

15     The cautioned statement of the accused was recorded by DSP Liew’s colleague, one Ms Chai Siew Ying. The cautioned statement was admitted as P5 as the defence did not object to its admission. In P5, the accused said “_I admit to the charge and plead for leniency_.” DSP Liew checked with the SP group with regard to the utility bill for the Marine Terrace flat. Based on the screening, Wong Soon Cheng, PW3, was the account holder for the utilities for the Marine Terrace flat from 27 June 2013 till the 4 July 2014 and the flat was occupied by the accused.

#### Chai Siew Ying (ASP Chai), PW6 and Pham Van Anh (Ms Pham), PW7

16     ASP Chai recorded P5 from the accused on the 14 March 2018 at the ICA office. A Vietnamese interpreter was present and through the interpreter, Ms Pham, ASP Chai read the charge for the offence of giving a false statement to the accused and recorded the statement which she provided. The accused did not say anything else other than what was recorded in response to the charge.

17     In cross-examination, ASP Chai confirmed that she also recorded a long statement, D6, from the accused. She had asked the accused whether or not she was staying at the Bedok flat at the date of the application for permanent residence on 13 March 2014. The accused had replied that she mainly stayed at the Marine Terrace flat but would return occasionally to the Bedok flat about once a week.

18     Ms Pham confirmed that she had acted as the Vietnamese interpreter in the recording of P5 and D6 from the accused. Her duty was to interpret the conversation between the recording officer and the accused. Her role was to interpret the questions posed from English to Vietnamese and the responses of the accused in Vietnamese to English.

## The Defence

19     The accused, DWI, a Vietnamese national, testified that she came to Singapore in 2007. While she was walking at the east coast park with some friends she met Mat who was there with his friends having a barbecue party. She exchanged telephone numbers with him and they kept in contact after she returned to Vietnam. After a while they developed feelings for each other. About a year later she returned to Singapore and he proposed to her. They got married in May 2009. 2 of his friends attended the registration ceremony of their marriage but no one from Vietnam came for the wedding as she intended to have a wedding ceremony in Vietnam.

20     After the marriage the accused moved to Mat’s place to stay with him. The address was the Bedok flat. After they had been married for a while Mat introduced her to Wong Soon Cheng (Wong), PW3, as a friend who used to help him a lot. The accused quarrelled with Mat over his drinking and gambling. She confided in Wong and after a while she entered into a sexual relationship with him. At the same time, she was still in a sexual relationship with her husband.

21     When she became pregnant with her first child in June, 2013, Wong helped to look for another place for her to stay. He rented a place at Marine Terrace for her to live in. On 28 August 2013 her first son was born. The surname Wong was included in the birth certificate of the son as Wong wanted to be the godfather and requested that his name be inserted as part of the surname of the son. Her second son was born on 29 September 2014 and Wong’s surname was also included as part of the son’s name. After she moved to the Marine Terrace flat, she returned to the Bedok flat once a week. She only moved out temporarily and her main address remained the Bedok flat. In 2015, the accused obtained a divorce from Mat. He did not comply with the order of court on maintenance. When the accused gave her long statement, D6, she had disclosed that she was mainly staying at the Marine Terrace flat as she would go back to the Bedok flat once a week.

22     In cross-examination the accused maintained that her mother could not attend her wedding as she was unwell. In D6, the accused agreed that she disclosed that she had been living with Wong in a rented room in Marine Terrace since sometime in 2013. She agreed that when she submitted P2 on 13 March 2014 she was residing with Michael Wong in the Marine Terrace flat.

## The Decision

23     The accused has claimed trial to 1 charge of making a false statement when she declared on 13 March 2014 to ICA that Block 114, Bedok North St 2, XXX, Singapore 460114 (the Bedok flat) is her residential address and that she was residing with the sponsor, her then husband, Mat, PW1, at this address at the time of the application. This is an offence under section 57(1)(k) of the Immigration Act and punishable under section 57(1)(vi) of the said Act.

24     I shall begin with the undisputed facts. Firstly, the accused and Mat were married in Singapore on the 4 of May 2009 and after her marriage she lived in his Bedok flat. (This marriage has been dissolved on the 28 September 2015.) Secondly, she had made the declaration, which is the subject of the charge, in her application for permanent residence, P2, and she had duly signed the form. Thirdly, P2 was signed both by herself and her sponsor, Mat. Fourthly, as a result of the accused’s application she obtained an entry permit and was granted permanent residence on 30 June 2015 (P4). Next, was the fact that Mat had pleaded guilty to a similar charge of making a false statement when he declared as a local sponsor on 13 March 2014 that the accused’s address in Singapore was the Bedok flat and in his SOF[^2] which he admitted unreservedly, Mat admitted that he had entered into a sham marriage with the accused at the request of his friend, Wong, PW3.

25     The accused has admitted that she left the Bedok flat in June 2013[^3] and went to stay at Blk 58, Marine Terrace, #XXX ( the Marine Terrace flat). The Marine Terrace flat was arranged for her to stay in by Wong. Despite moving to the Marine Terrace flat, the accused claimed that she returned to the Bedok flat once a week. Therefore, her defence was that her address remained the Bedok flat and she did not lie when she made the declaration on 13 March 2014 that the Bedok flat is her residential address. In his closing submission counsel for the accused argued that the accused was staying at 2 addresses simultaneously, namely at the Bedok flat and the Marine Terrace flat as at 13 March 2014, the date when she submitted P2.

26     The prosecution submitted to the contrary. Their case is that the accused was not staying at the Bedok flat when she made the application for permanent residence and she had made a false statement. The only issue to be determined therefore is whether the accused was residing at the Bedok flat when she submitted her application for permanent residence, P2, to ICA on 13 March 2014.

27     The prosecution witnesses disputed the accused’s claim that she returned to the Bedok flat even once a week after she left. These 2 witnesses would be Mat and his mother, Mdm Ah Moi, PW2. Mat was unequivocally firm that after the accused left in June 2013 to stay in the Marine Terrace flat, she did not return to stay in the Bedok flat[^4]. He elaborated that the accused came back just to visit his mother and that apart from this visit, she did not stay at all in the Bedok flat[^5]. His testimony was corroborated by Mdm Ah Moi. Her evidence, which was unchallenged by the defence and it was never put to her that she was lying, was to the same effect, in that after the accused moved out[^6] to a place that she was not aware of, the accused only came back to visit her once[^7]. The following questions posted to her and answers[^8] provided by Mdm Ah Moi, were overwhelmingly clear.

_Q_ _Okay, Mdm. Ah Moi, you said earlier that the accused person used to stay or reside in Block 114 Bedok North Street 2, correct? She used to stay there, am I right?_

_A_ _Correct._

_Q_ _Yes. Do you know when she moved out from that unit in Block---from 114 Bedok North, do you know?_

_A_ _I’ve forgotten. She moved out and I didn’t pay attention to the date on which she moved._

_Q_ _Okay, after she moved out from Block 114 Bedok North Street 2, did she ever come back to---come back to Block 114 to stay---to stay there as well or she just visited you?_

_A_ _Just to visit me._

28     There was no mention of Mat being around during this singular visit by the accused and her 2 sons.

29     Mat and Mdm Ah Moi were the occupiers of the Bedok flat. They would be in the best position to testify as to who was occupying and staying in their flat as at 13 March 2014. Mdm Ah Moi’s unchallenged evidence to the effect the accused visited her with the children[^9] only once can only mean that the visit must have occurred after 29 September 2014. This is because the second child was only born on this date and for the accused to have visited with the children, and not with a child, just once, would certainly imply that from August 2013 till after September 2014, the accused had kept away from the Bedok flat. The irresistible conclusion is that the accused had moved out from the Bedok flat and was residing permanently at the Marine Terrace flat as at 13 March 2014 and contrary to her claim, the Marine Terrace flat was the place she was residing at on 13 March 2014.

30     Even if I were to accept and believe the accused’s case at its highest and in her favour, which is that she returned to the Bedok flat, once a week, and from her own evidence, she did not even stay the night, which would have meant that it was just a mere visit, surely, this cannot translate to mean that as at 13 March 2014, she was residing at the Bedok flat. Based on the accused’s own admission, as at 13 March 2014, it was absolutely baseless for her counsel to make the submission that accused was staying at 2 addresses simultaneously, namely at the Bedok flat and the Marine Terrace flat.

31     This submission was not even supported by the accused’s evidence. In her long statement dated the 14 of March, 2018, D6, which she tendered to court, the accused disclosed that “… _For my third application dated 13-03-2014, I was mainly staying at Marrine Terrace with Wong Soon Cheng. However, I would return to Bedok occasionally about once a week. As I was still married to Mat Peng Hwa, I feel that it was right to write my husband's address as the address in my PR application_.”[^10] I regard this as an explicit admission by the accused that she was indeed staying at the Marine Terrace flat and that her occasional returns to the Bedok flat about once a week did not change the fact that as at 13 March 2014, the Bedok flat was not her residential address and she was not staying with her sponsor, her then husband, Mat, as at 13 March 2014.

32     The accused appeared to have ignored the fact that there are 2 parts to the declaration made to ICA on 13 March 2014, namely that her residential address is the Bedok flat and that she was staying at this address together with her sponsor, Mat, which is not the case, since she was staying mainly with Wong at the Marine Terrace flat. Returning to the Bedok flat, once a week, if the accused’s evidence is to be accepted, when there was no interaction with Mat, can only mean that she was not staying with Mat at the Bedok flat. The accused had tried to salvage the situation of where exactly she was staying by testifying that Mat had visited her 3 times [^11]a week, in the morning, when she was living with Wong in the Marine Terrace flat. However, for reasons that were never disclosed, this was never raised or put to Mat when he was being cross-examined, which once again demonstrated clearly that this was another fabrication on the part of the accused and a desperate afterthought. In any case, this visit was at the Marine Terrace flat and by no stretch of the imagination can this therefore mean that the accused was staying with Mat at the Bedok flat on the 13 March 2014.

33     When the accused was trying to explain paragraph 17 of D6, she added that “_in my mind, Bedok is still the main home and the Marine Terrace is just a place I was staying temporarily_.”[^12] If Marine Terrace was really a temporary home, then there would have been no need for the accused to state that she was “_mainly staying_” in Marine Terrace. Accepting for a moment that it was temporary, the Marine Terrace flat would have been therefore her residential address as at 13 March 2014 which she was not occupying with Mat, but in fact with Wong. I find it difficult to believe that the Marine Terrace was a temporary home as such a home would suggest that it would have been a short term stay, which is definitely not the case here. The accused moved out in June 2013 and by 13 March 2014, a good 9 months later, when she submitted her application she was still residing, in her own words, mainly in Marine Terrace, which can only mean that it had become her permanent residential address.

34     Further, the accused has, in her response to the charge, in her cautioned statement, P5, when it was read to her on the 14 March 2018 said “_I admit to the charge and plead for leniency_.” When the accused was questioned why she had admitted to the charge, she claimed that she did not understand the law in Singapore. However, it was an undisputed fact that the accused had the services of a Vietnamese interpreter when the charge was read to her who had explained to her the charge, and the accused could not have been mistaken by the law as it was a simple matter of her making a false declaration to ICA when she made the application on 13 March 2014 for permanent residence. She knew what she did was wrong when she gave the false information.

35     While the accused had also claimed that she left everything to Mat to fill in the details in P2, Mat had testified that the accused is well versed in Mandarin and the form writer had explained to them in Mandarin what was written on the form. The accused’s ability to understand Mandarin cannot be denied by her as she had declared in her own exhibit, D6, that as early as 2007, when she was in Singapore for a holiday, that “ _I was already able to speak Mandarin then.”_[^13] She would have understood that the purpose of submitting P2 was to enable her to obtain permanent residence in Singapore so that she could continue to stay here. She declared that the particulars provided in P2 were true and correct and there was no suppression of any particular fact.

36     I will now address the issue of the accused’s marriage on 4 May 2009. While I am mindful that the accused has not been charged with entering into a marriage of convenience for the purpose of getting permanent residence in Singapore, and she insisted that it was a love marriage, the fact remained that 1 party to the marriage, namely Mat, has admitted that it was a sham marriage which he entered with the accused upon the request of Wong.

37     Mat had explained that “_Because she (referring to the accused) wanted to stay here, so she asked me to marry_”[^14] and he confirmed that he had agreed to Wong’s request because the accused wanted to stay in Singapore[^15]. He was grateful to Wong and the marriage to the accused was not out of love[^16].

38     I am inclined to believe Mat for several reasons. He has already been dealt with in court as he had pleaded guilty and served his sentence and there is no incentive for him to fabricate evidence against the accused. He was not antagonistic towards the accused. More significantly, it was notable that not a single family member from either the accused’s side or Mat’s side attended the wedding ceremony on the 4 May 2009. The accused gave the excuse that her widowed mother was ill and could not attend the ceremony. However, she has siblings and being the eldest child in her family and this being her first marriage, which would have been an important milestone in her life, I would have expected at least her siblings or even some close friends to make an effort to attend the marriage ceremony. The accused had described the marriage as a simple ceremony but it must have been a very trivial matter to her and Mat, as there was hardly any celebration, no preparation made for the wedding ceremony and no photographs to mark the occasion, fuelling doubts as to whether it was a legitimate and normal marriage.

39     Where Mat was concerned, the accused gave the excuse that his parents were old and that was why they were not present at the marriage ceremony. While this perhaps may explain their absence at the ceremony, Mat is the only child and son of Mdm Ah Moi and it would appear to be the case that Mdm Ah Moi was not even aware of his marriage to the accused. When Mdm Ah Moi was giving her testimony and questioned “ _Do you know the relationship between your son, Mat and the accused person, Ah Wen_ ?”[^17] she replied unhesitatingly “ _Friends_”[^18]. In fact, when she was asked whether she knew that the accused and her son Mat were married, Mdm Ah Moi responded candidly “_Married before? I’m not too sure_.”[^19]

40     If it was a genuine and love marriage as claimed by the accused whereby she went to live in the Bedok flat together with Mat as his wife, there would have been every reason for Mat to inform his mother of his marriage, which would have been a joyous occasion worthy of some celebration, and she would have referred to the accused as her daughter in law but she did not. When she was asked in cross-examination “_Now, how did Ah Wen treat you when she was staying with you at Bedok North_ ?”[^20] Mdm Ah Moi had replied “_Good friends---like good friends_.”[^21] The accused apparently did not treat her as a mother-in-law which is consistent with Mat’s assertion that the marriage was sham in nature.

41     Then there was the matter of the sleeping arrangements at the Bedok flat which has only 1 bedroom. Both Mat[^22] and his mother Mdm Ah Moi testified that the accused occupied the only bedroom while he and his mother slept in the living room[^23]. Again, if it was a genuine marriage, I would have expected the accused and Mat to sleep in the same bedroom just like any other married couple would, if they had entered into a marriage based on mutual love. Mdm Ah Moi was right then when she described their relationship as “_friends_” and the accused was just a mere tenant in the Bedok flat of the one bedroom and was not a legitimate wife of Mat.

42     While there were 2 sons born out of the marriage on paper, Mat testified that he is not their biological father[^24] and his marriage was never consummated. Both the accused and Wong were evasive as to who the father of the 2 sons are, with the accused saying she was not sure “_if Mat Peng Hwa is their father_” [^25] and Wong saying similarly that he was not sure[^26]. The birth certificates of both sons bore “Mat” and “Wong” as their surnames with the explanation given by the accused in court that Wong[^27] wanted to be their godfather and Mat had agreed. What the accused had said in court was materially different from what she had disclosed in D6, as to why the children had 2 surnames as she stated “... _I was unsure if the children belong to Mat Peng Hwa or Wong Soon Cheng._ **_Hence I decided to include both surnames "Mat" and "Wong" into the name of my sons._** ”[^28] (Emphasis added) This was the reason she gave as at 14 March 2018, when D6 was recorded from her, for her decision to include both surnames in their birth certificates. This position changed on 24 January 2019 when she testified in court. The accused did not provide any satisfactory explanation for this discrepancy.

43     Further, when Mat was cross-examined it was never put to him that there was such a request by Wong for his surname to be inserted in the birth certificates of the 2 sons and he had acceded to this request. I can only conclude that what the accused was raising now on this surname issue was just an afterthought and fabrication on her part as it did not make sense for Mat to agree to the name of another man to be inserted as part of the surname of his sons, if he, meaning Mat, was the legitimate father of those sons.

44     In any event, the accused must have forgotten what Wong had said on this score, as her evidence contradicted what he said as he had testified that it was the accused and Mat who asked him whether he wanted to be the godfather[^29] and therefore the idea was not his . Wong had in fact elaborated that he did not agree to their request but the accused and Mat had insisted[^30]. Obviously, it seems to me the idea of Wong being a godfather to explain his surname being included in the birth certificates was probably something the accused and Wong must have hatched prior to the court hearing. In the first place, Wong can be their godfather without having his surname inserted in their birth certificates. The accused has admitted that she and her 2 sons now live together with Wong as a family unit[^31] and Wong has also admitted that the 2 sons addressed him as father[^32]. And, the simple explanation for this was the fact that he was truly their father, and not Mat, whose evidence I believed, that his marriage to the accused was not consummated because it was a sham marriage he had entered to enable the accused to stay in Singapore.

45     Further, if these 2 sons are Mat’s legitimate children, it would be reasonable to expect Mdm Ah Moi to describe them as her grandsons but she did not and merely referred to them as the accused’s children. While I note that in the divorce papers of the accused and Mat, there were orders for maintenance for the accused and the 2 sons, she has never sought to enforce these orders and since she was the party who had initiated the divorce she could have easily lodged a complaint to enforce them. This merely reinforces my finding that the marriage was essentially a sham marriage and the orders of court, especially for the divorce were obtained to end this sham marriage so as to enable the accused to carry on with her living arrangements with Wong.

## Conclusion

46     In conclusion, I was satisfied that there was sufficient evidence which proved the prosecution’s case beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had a made a false statement in her application, P2, for permanent residence to ICA as she was not residing at the Bedok North flat together with her local sponsor, Mat, PW1, on 13 March 2014; the date of her application at ICA. The accused knew full well that she had made a false statement as it was definitely within her knowledge where she was staying and with whom at the material time. I therefore found the accused guilty and convicted her on the charge.

47     Upon her conviction, the prosecution informed me that the accused was a first offender. The prosecution, in their address on sentence, informed the court again that the co-accused, Mat, had been sentenced to a term of 6 weeks’ imprisonment which he had served. Since the accused has claimed trial, they submitted that she should receive a sentence of 8 weeks’ imprisonment. In mitigation, defence counsel, while conceding that the usual sentence for making a false declaration would be imprisonment highlighted some cases which were mentioned in the case of _PP v Lim Cheng Meng and Mu Hong_ \[2015\] SGDC 156 whereby fines were imposed. There were no other mitigating circumstances raised by counsel.

48     The prescribed penalty for the offence of making a false statement under section 57(1)(k) of the Immigration Act is a fine not exceeding $4,000 or with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both. Applying the established sentencing guidelines which were enunciated in the case of _Abu Syeed Chowdhury v PP_ \[2002\] 1 SLR(R) 182, the norm has always been the imposition of custodial sentences, where false representations were made to ICA. The High Court went on to elaborate on the considerations which must be taken into account, in sentencing and this included whether the representation was material on the mind of the decision maker.

49     Coming to the facts of this case, the information in the application form for the permanent residence, P2, submitted by the accused on 13 March 2014 was certainly material to the ICA’s decision whether or not to grant the application. In this regard I refer to the testimony of ASP Ong, PW4, who is the senior processing executive for applications for permanent residence. He had testified that the residential address is a material consideration for an application like the accused’s which is under the family ties scheme[^33]. The applicant and the sponsor are expected to be staying together. ASP Ong had also gone on to say that if the applicant, the accused here, and the sponsor, Mat, are not staying together, ICA would call for both of them to provide an explanation for further consideration[^34]. This would have necessitated an investigation into the true status of their relationship as husband and wife. Since the evidence of ASP Ong was not challenged by the defence, I accepted it as a material factor.

50     Further, I had made a finding that the marriage between the accused and Mat was a sham marriage, entered for the purpose of facilitating her stay in Singapore. For his part, in also making the false statement regarding the accused’s residential address in Singapore, Mat had received a custodial sentence. There was no reason to treat the accused differently. I agreed with the prosecution that her sentence should be higher than the 6 weeks which was meted out to him. This is not to penalise the accused for claiming trial but she is certainly not entitled to the sentencing discount usually afforded to accused persons who have pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity.

51     With regard to the precedents cited by the defence where fines had been imposed, I note that some of these are cases where there was no finding that the marriage was a sham one. More significantly, there were no written judgments issued for these cases and it was not possible to ascertain the rationale as to why fines were imposed. There was hence little utility in using them as precedents. As was stated in the preceding paragraph, since Mat, her co-accused had been sentenced to imprisonment, which it must be emphasised again is the norm for such cases, there was a need to maintain parity in sentencing and the accused likewise deserve a custodial sentence. The accused also did not raise anything exceptional in her mitigation to justify a non-custodial sentence.

52     All considered, I sentenced the accused to serve 8 weeks’ imprisonment. She is currently on bail pending the hearing of her appeal.
