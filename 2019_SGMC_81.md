### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## The Charges

1       The accused, Mr Vijayan Gopal Mathan, a 40-year-old Indian national had claimed trial to three charges of outrage of modesty on board an aircraft that was en route from Cochin, India to Singapore, under s 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”) read with s 3(1) of the Tokyo Convention (Cap 327, 1985 Rev Ed) (“Tokyo Convention”) namely:

> (i)      **MAC 901798 - 2018** (**Exhibit C1C)**

1st Amended Charge

> “…that you, on the 2nd day of November 2017 between 4.01 a.m. and 8.14 a.m. (Singapore time), on board a Singapore-controlled aircraft bearing registration number 9V-TAQ, TR 571, en route from Cochin, India to Singapore, while in flight elsewhere than in or over Singapore, did use criminal force on one \[the victim\]by:

>> (a)    holding \[her\] right arm with one hand and touching her face with the other hand; and

>> (b)    cupping \[her\] face with your hands knowing it to be likely that you would thereby outrage \[her\] modesty, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) read with section 3(1) of the Tokyo Convention Act (Cap 327, 1985 Rev Ed).”

> (ii)      **MAC 901799 - 2018** (**Exhibit C2C)**

2ndAmended Charge

> “… that you, on the 2nd day of November 2017 between 4.01 a.m. and 8.14 a.m. (Singapore time), on board a Singapore-controlled aircraft bearing registration number 9V-TAQ, TR 571, en route from Cochin, India to Singapore, while in flight elsewhere than in or over Singapore, did use criminal force on \[the victim\] by placing your hand on \[her\] right thigh, knowing it to be likely that you would thereby outrage \[her\] modesty, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) read with section 3(1) of the Tokyo Convention Act (Cap 327, 1985 Rev Ed).”

> (iii)      **MAC 901800 - 2018** (**Exhibit C3C)**

3rd Amended Charge

> _“…_ are charged that you, on the 2nd day of November 2017 between 4.01 a.m. and 8.14 a.m. (Singapore time), on board a Singapore-controlled aircraft bearing registration number 9V-TAQ, TR 571, en route from Cochin, India to Singapore, while in flight elsewhere than in or over Singapore, did use criminal force on \[the victim\] by touching \[her\] buttock with your hand, knowing it to be likely that you would thereby outrage \[her\] modesty, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) read with section 3(1) of the Tokyo Convention Act (Cap 327, 1985 Rev Ed).”

2       On 5 August 2019, at the conclusion of the trial and after a careful consideration of the evidence as well as written submissions before me, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case on all three proceeded charges beyond a reasonable doubt. I did not accept his bare denial of the offences as well as his defence that these were false allegations made against him by the victim and a fellow Scoot stewardess in an attempt to prevent a formal complaint of poor service against the latter from surfacing. I convicted the accused on all three of the charges in **MAC 901798 - 2018, MAC 901799 - 2018** and **MAC 901800 - 2018**. I then adjourned the matter to 27 September 2019 for the Prosecution to prepare its address on sentence and for the Defence to prepare its plea in mitigation.

3       Subsequently, on 27 September 2019 after a careful consideration of the Prosecution’s written address on sentence, the plea in mitigation as well as the factual matrix of the charges before me, I imposed the following sentences:

> (i)      **MAC 901798 - 2018** – one month’s imprisonment;

> (ii)      **MAC 901799 - 2018** – three months’ imprisonment; and

> (iii)      **MAC 901800 - 2018** – three month’s imprisonment.

I ordered the sentences for **MAC 901798 - 2018** and **MAC 901800 - 2018** to run consecutively. The global sentence imposed on the accused was **four months’ imprisonment**.

4       Dissatisfied with my decision, the Accused filed a Notice of Appeal against his conviction only in **MAC 901798 – 2018, MAC 901799 – 2018** and **MAC 901800 – 2018** on 27 September 2019. He is presently on bail pending the hearing of his appeal.

5       I now provide the reasons for my decision.

6       During the trial, the Prosecution called seven witnesses to the stand to give evidence against the accused. They are:

## The Undisputed Facts

7       The following facts are undisputed namely:

> a)     On 2 November 2017, PW4 had flown a Singapore-controlled Scoot aircraft bearing registration number 9V-TAQ, TR 571, with 96 passengers, the First Officer, George Lee Kuan Chuan and four crew members from Cochin, India to Singapore;

> b)     At the material time, the victim, PW2, PW3, PW4, PW7 and the accused were amongst those on the said flight and the victim was on duty as the cabin crew-in-charge (“CIC”). The victim and another stewardess, one Lee Jun Wei Adeline were responsible for the passengers in front portion of the plane while PW2 and PW7 were responsible for the passengers at the back portion of the plane;

> c)     During the flight, the accused was seated at seat 24D (although his assigned seat was 24F) while PW3 was seated directly behind him at seat 25D;

> d)     The first occasion PW2 had interacted with the accused was when he was at seat 30C (the last row of seats before the galley) and he used the call light to order some food. PW2 asked the accused to return to his original seat and the accused went to seat 24D;

> e)     In the course of the flight, the accused had pressed the call light again as he wanted to order a Peranakan chicken meal and red wine. PW2 attended to him and there was an argument between the accused and PW2 as he was dissatisfied over Scoot’s upfront payment policy for his meal;

> f)     In the course of the flight, there was a medical emergency involving a passenger who was seated at seat 2D and the victim as the CIC had attended to the said passenger;

> g)     At about the same time, the accused had pressed the call light several times and when PW7 attended to him, the accused had specifically requested for the victim while she attended to the medical emergency;

> h)     The accused was a difficult and disruptive passenger who had pressed the call light for service on multiple occasions. The victim, PW2 and PW7 had attended and interacted to the accused during the flight;

> i)     The accused had consumed both wine and whisky during the flight and made frequent demands of the flight crew, who were operating under fairly stressful and tiring conditions, _i.e._, a night flight, and with a medical emergency;

> j)     During the flight, when the accused indicated that he wanted to complain against PW2, the victim provided the accused with both her and PW2’s names, their staff numbers as well as the airline email address i.e. customerexperience@scoot on portion of an air sickness bag (_Exhibit D1_) for him to email his complaint;

> k)     The victim had knelt along the narrow aisle next to the accused when she attended to the accused’s complaint of unhappiness with the service provided by PW2;

> l)     The accused had no issues or complaints against the victim. In addition, the victim and the accused were strangers and were not known to each other previously;

> m)     s 3(1) of the Tokyo Convention (Cap 327, 1985 Rev Ed) was made out.

## The Prosecution’s Case

8       It was the Prosecution’s case that commercial air travel is a high-pressured environment, with at least a hundred passengers on board – and sometimes, several hundred passengers – packed into a confined space of an aircraft cabin for a period of time. There are no ready means of escape, and immediate assistance from law enforcement is practically impossible. This was the very predicament of the victim, an air stewardess found herself when she was molested by the accused while working on Scoot Flight TR 571.

9       According to the Prosecution, the accused had used criminal force on the victim, knowing it to be likely that he would outrage her modesty by the following acts, namely:

> (a)     holding the victim’s right arm with one hand and touching her face with the other hand, and cupping the victim’s face with his hands;

> (b)     placing his hand on the victim’s right thigh; and

> (c)     touching the victim’s buttock with his hand.

10     It was submitted that the victim had testified that on 2 November 2017 the accused was the last passenger to board Flight TR 571 from Cochin to Singapore (“the flight”) and he had smelt strongly of alcohol when he boarded with his pants unzipped. Nonetheless, he was able to walk properly to his seat, listen to her instructions to zip up his pants and passed her his boarding pass. PW7 testified that prior to take-off, the accused wanted to order two bottles of Johnny Walker whisky, but PW7 told the accused that he would not be able to serve him until after the plane had taken off. PW7 subsequently informed the victim of the accused’s order for a whisky at the time of boarding and that he had rejected his request and told him that they could only serve drinks after take-off. The plane then took off and soon after, the victim noticed that the accused was having a dispute with PW2, an air stewardess who was part of the cabin crew, at seat 24D (aisle seat).

11     It was further submitted that the victim approached them and found out that they were arguing about the accused’s order of food and red wine. PW2 informed her that the accused did not want to make payment after he made his order despite PW2 informing him that it was Scoot’s policy to collect payment before they could heat up the food. The victim noted that the accused was angry with PW2 and wanted to lodge a complaint against her. To diffuse the situation, she relented and agreed to serve him his food before he made payment.

12     It was the Prosecution’s case that the victim and PW2 then went to the back of the plane i.e. the galley where she told PW2 to heat up the food, serve the food and alcohol to the accused and to apologise to him. She did so because she wanted PW2 to appease the accused and calm him down, given that he wanted to complain against PW2. PW2 complied and served the accused, but the accused refused to have the food and alcohol. The victim then asked PW7, a male air steward, to keep the food. She then approached the accused, and checked with him as to why he had rejected the food. He told her it was because PW2 had looked down on him and was very rude, and she assured him that she would talk to PW2. Thereafter, the victim asked PW7 to serve the meal and red wine to the accused, to minimise the interaction between the accused and PW2. PW7 gave evidence that the victim asked him to serve the accused and the accused accepted the meal.

13     It was submitted that after PW7 served the food and drink to the accused, the accused pressed the call light and PW7 attended to him. PW7 testified that the accused had wanted to order more alcohol. After the alcohol was served to him, the accused continued to press the call light repeatedly, “up to 5 times” and on each occasion, PW7 had attended to him. On these occasions, the accused requested to talk to “that female steward” i.e. the victim.

14     It was the Prosecution’s case that the victim had attended to the accused’s requests on several occasions. The victim had testified that the first time she attended to the accused was when he told her that he wanted to complain against PW2 and she had told him that she would talk to PW2 and make her apologise to him. Subsequently, the victim had to attend to a medical emergency involving a passenger in seat 2D who was feeling faint and lacked oxygen. As this was going on, the accused had pressed the call light repeatedly and PW7 had attended to him. It was submitted that PW7 then informed the victim that the accused was looking for her, cautioned her that the accused was slurring and appeared to be drunk. It was further submitted that according to the victim, the situation was “very urgent” because there was a medical emergency that required her to page for medical assistance (or inform the captain so that they can land urgently) and a drunk passenger that required her attention.

15     It was the Prosecution’s case that after a nurse came forward to assist in the medical emergency, the victim then went on to attend to the accused. She knelt down to be at his eye level, placed her arm on the arm rest of his seat and told the accused firmly not to press the call light again. The accused then told her that he wanted to complain about PW2 again. She told him that he could complain and she proceeded to write down her name and PW2’s name and their staff numbers for the accused to follow-up on his complaint.

#### Evidence pertaining to the offences

16     It was the Prosecution’s case that after she provided the particulars to the accused, suddenly the accused asked her where she lived and she replied near the airport. At this juncture the accused held her right hand which was on the arm rest, touched her face with his other hand and uttered the words “_You are so beautiful_”. It was submitted that she had described the touch as a movement of his hand from her forehead down to the chin. He then touched her face by using both his hands to cup her face. She testified that this made her angry, uncomfortable and very disgusted, but she could not push him away because he was a passenger. She leaned back, raised her voice saying “_Sir_, _Sir_, _Sir_” and he said “_Do not throw your anger at me_” and “_I’m the boss of the flight_”.

17     It was further submitted that as she was leaning back, she turned her head away from the accused and saw that both PW2 and PW3 were looking at her. She tried to stand up but the accused continued to grab on to her right arm. She then tried again to stand up and the accused put his hand on her right thigh, with strong force. When she finally managed to stand up by grabbing the arm rest, she turned around and felt the accused touching her backside. She described the touch as a palm on the left buttock. Although she was not facing the accused at that time, she looked back _immediately_ when she felt the palm on her buttock and saw that the accused’s arm was hanging out of the arm rest. According to the victim, it could not have been any other passengers surrounding him because they were asleep, save for PW3. It was the Prosecution’s case that at that time, the area was lit by light coming in from the window and the galley lights were also on (and the galley curtains were open), even though the aisle lights were dimmed. The victim described the lighting conditions as bright enough to see through the cabin.

#### Victim’s actions subsequent to the offences

18     The victim gave evidence that after the accused had touched her buttock, she proceeded straight to the galley. When she asked PW2 whether she saw what the accused did to her, PW2 replied in the affirmative. It was submitted that this was corroborated by PW2 in her testimony. The victim then asked PW2 to bring PW3 to the galley. It was further submitted when she asked PW3 whether she saw what the accused did to her, PW3 also replied in the affirmative. It was highlighted by the Prosecution that PW3 then agreed to be a witness for the victim, and this was corroborated by PW3 as well. Hence, the victim told her to write down her particulars and what she had observed in **_Exhibit P2_**.

19     It was the Prosecution’s case that soon after, the victim reported this incident to the captain, PW4 and requested him to call the airport police. It was submitted that she told PW4 that the accused was already drunk and had touched her face and buttock, and that she had a witness. This was corroborated by PW4 during his testimony and he had observed that she was shaken. He then queried if the victim would like him to call the police on landing in Singapore, and she indicated that she wanted the police to be present on landing into Singapore.

20     It was submitted that after the plane landed in Singapore at about 8.00 a.m. on 2 November 2017, the victim put up a report i.e. **_Exhibit P1_** _\-_ Assessment Summary INAPPROPRIATE PAX BEHAVIOUR TO CREW TR 271 to submit to Scoot to notify the related department of the incident. She had put this report up at midnight on 2 November 2017 as after the plane landed, she had to do a statement report with the airport police until late afternoon. According to the victim, she was very tired and needed to rest before putting up the report.

#### Corroborative evidence

21     It was the Prosecution’s case that aside from the victim’s evidence, it had also adduced corroborative evidence to support the victim’s account. This came in the form of independent eyewitness accounts and documentary evidence that had been alluded to the incident during the flight.

22     The first eyewitness who testified was PW2. It was submitted that she was an independent witness given that both she and the victim confirmed that they were merely colleagues and only flew once together before the incident, despite having flown with Scoot for 5 years (victim) and 3 years (PW2) respectively. PW2 had testified that at the material time, she was standing at the galley when she saw the victim kneeling down to talk to the accused. The victim was facing the accused and towards the back galley, and she saw the accused use two hands to touch the victim’s face. Then, she saw the victim lean back and try to leave the accused. When she stood up, PW2 saw the accused use one hand to touch the victim’s buttock. At that time, she saw the accused’s hand at the aisle, and she was sure it was his hand that touched the victim’s buttock because she was only a few rows away from them and the galley light was bright.

23     It was further submitted that she then asked the victim if she was “okay” and the victim replied “not okay”. PW2 observed that the victim looked troubled, her face was not normal and she was clearly not comfortable with what happened. The victim then asked her if she saw what happened, and PW2 answered in the affirmative and offered to help inform the captain, PW4. It was highlighted by the Prosecution when asked if she was colluding with the victim to fabricate this story, PW2 disagreed and explained that she had no reason to make up a story as she was on duty and did not want any trouble with the accused.

24     It was the Prosecution’s case that the second eyewitness was PW3. PW3 was an independent witness, who had not even seen the accused or the victim prior to the flight on 2 November 2017. PW3 had given evidence that she was seated in seat 25D, right behind the accused, and was unable to sleep on the flight because the accused was creating a nuisance by repeatedly pressing the call light, resulting in the cabin crew coming to talk to him and then leaving and coming back again. She had also testified that there was a medical emergency on board the flight, and while that was ongoing, the accused had continued to press the call light.

25     It was submitted that subsequently, she saw the victim sitting at an angle facing the accused, and later she saw the accused’s left hand touch the victim’s back. Even though she could not see his face from where she was sitting, she saw his left hand behind the back of the victim. It was further submitted that during her cross-examination, she testified that she saw the accused lean to the left and could see a bit of his body from the back, and that was why she could confirm that it was his left hand that touched the victim. It was highlighted by the Prosecution that PW3 was very shocked by this, and agreed to the victim’s witness because she thought it was the right thing to do.

26     It was submitted that PW3 then wrote a letter (“**_Exhibit P2_**”) for the victim at the galley. In **_Exhibit P2_**, PW3 had written down that she “_just happened to see a female crew onboard being ill treated by a drunk, both by words as well as by action_”. She explained that she felt that the victim was “ill-treated” because of the accused’s misbehaviour, in “words” because they kept on talking and in “action” because of what she saw earlier. When asked during cross-examination on why she did not mention that the accused had touched the victim in the letter, she explained that the word “actions” in the letter was meant to capture this. She testified that the lighting conditions at the time were not dark, and while she could not recall if the aisle lights were dimmed, she remembered that she could see clearly.

#### Contemporaneous reporting

27     It was the Prosecution’s case that immediately after the incident, when the plane was still mid-air, the victim had reported to PW4 that she was molested. It was submitted that this was corroborated by PW4’s testimony and he had also testified that she appeared shaken to him. She then told PW4 that she would like the police to be available on landing into Singapore and thus he sent a message to his Operations Control to request for the police to be present on landing.

28     It was further submitted that PW5, the auxiliary SATS police officer on duty that day, testified that he had received a call at 8.00 a.m. from the SATS Command Centre stating that SATS police assistance was needed to attend to a case of unruly passenger. When he went down to the location of the plane, he met PW4 and PW4 reported to him that a passenger had touched one of their cabin crew. He then submitted the Duty Controller’s Report (_Exhibit P6_) to his management. PW5 had reported that the accused had allegedly physically touched the victim’s face and she wanted to make a police report as she felt molested. He then lodged a police report (**_Exhibit P7_**) stating that this was a case of outrage modesty.

29     In addition, it was submitted that the victim had lodged a report within 24 hours of the incident. In this report, (**_Exhibit P1_**), it was highlighted by the Prosecution that the victim had stated that:

> “…PAX USE HIS RIGHT HAND TO GRAB ON CIC RIGHT ARM. (CIC AVOID). C4 AND PAX 25D (APARNA KANAKARAJAN) WITNESS THE WHOLE SITUATION. PAX 24D USE HIS LEFT HAND TO TOUCH CIC FACE AND HEAD. CIC WARN THE PAX OF THE MISBEHAVIOUR. PAX 24D TOLD CIC THAT “DO NOT ANGRY TO ME BECAUSE IM PAX NOT SLAVE”. PAX 24D TRIED AGAIN TO HAD MORE CONTACT WITH CIC (PAX WAS PUT HIS LEFT HAND ON TOP OF CIC RIGHT THIGH AND WHILE CIC TRIED TO WALK AWAY AND FEEL SOMETHING ON HER BACKSIDE, CIC TURN OVER AND SAW PAX 24D WAS THERE…”

It was the Prosecution’s case that this account was squarely consistent with the victim’s testimony in Court.

## Close of the Prosecution’s Case

30     At the close of the Prosecution’s case, the Defence Counsel indicated that he was not making any submission of no case to answer. As I found that the Prosecution had made out a _prima facie_ case against the accused in respect of all three of the proceeded charges, I called for the accused to enter his defence on all the charges.

31     The accused elected to give evidence in Court for his Defence.

## The Defence’s Case

32     The accused is Mr. Vijayan Mathan Gopal who is a Quality Assurance Engineer by profession. He faced three charges under s 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev Ed) read with section 3(1) of the Tokyo Convention Act (Cap. 327, 1985 Rev Ed).

33     In essence, it was the Defence’s case that the evidence of the Prosecution’s witnesses were internally inconsistent, contradicted by each other’s evidence and the available external evidence, and did not advance the Prosecution’s case against the accused. It was submitted that the Prosecution’s evidence fell short of the requisite standard of proof required to convict the accused. According to the Defence, this comports with the central thrust of the accused’s evidence, which was that the alleged acts never took place.

34     It was submitted that there were deficiencies innate to the evidence put forward by the Prosecution’s key witnesses. These include:

> (i)     the material inconsistencies between the victim’s evidence and the evidence given by other key Prosecution witnesses,

> (ii) the fact that the victim’s account of the incident has been shifting in material aspects since the date the flight landed in Singapore; and

> (iii)     the unreliability of PW3’s evidence given the circumstances on board the flight at the time (and the fact that PW3’s evidence could have been tainted by innocent infection).

These deficiencies, in and of themselves, cast reasonable doubt over the Prosecution’s case.

35     At the outset it was highlighted by the Defence that not all of the Prosecution’s witnesses had professed during the trial to having seen all the alleged acts for which the accused was charged. It was submitted that for example, PW3 did not allege that the accused had touched or cupped the victim’s face, touched her right thigh, or held her right arm. PW2 also did not allege that the accused had held the victim’s right arm with one hand and touched her face with the other, or placed his hand on the victim’s right thigh.

#### The victim’s evidence was materially inconsistent with the evidence given by PW2 and PW3

36     Moreover, it was the Defence’s case that their evidence was defective in numerous ways. It was submitted that during the trial, the victim, PW2 and PW3 had all testified that the alleged offence was committed when the victim positioned herself in a kneeling position next to the accused. However, it was submitted that they had also gave conflicting accounts as to which direction the victim was facing when she was kneeling down next to the accused – whether she was facing the front of the plane or the back of the plane.

37     It was highlighted by the Defence that the victim had testified that she was facing the front of the plane when she was kneeling down next to the accused. PW3’s account also appeared to be that the victim was facing the front of the plane when she was kneeling down next to the accused, before she got up and walked towards to the back of the plane. However, PW2 had testified that the victim was facing the back of the plane, and even appeared to be sure about this when she said she could see the victim’s face from where she was standing at the back galley of the plane. It was submitted that at the very least, PW2’s contradictory account in this material aspect raises serious questions as to whether she even witnessed the victim kneeling down next to the accused, and the subsequent acts that were allegedly committed by the accused.

38     It was the Defence’s case that the Prosecution’s witnesses also gave conflicting accounts as to what happened immediately after the victim stood up from her kneeling position next to the accused. According to the victim, she was facing the front of the plane when she stood up, and then turned around and walked towards the back galley. PW3 had also testified seeing the victim turn around and walk towards the back of the plane. However, PW2 gave a completely different account of events. As mentioned above, PW2’s version of events was that the victim was facing the back of the plane. PW2 had testified that after the victim stood up (facing the back of the plane), she turned to face the forward galley. It was submitted that PW2 had testified that it was only after the accused (allegedly) touched the victim’s buttock that the victim turned back and walked to the back galley. It was the Defence’s case that if the victim were to be believed that she was facing the back of the plane when she felt a touch on her buttock, then it was impossible for PW2 to have seen the accused touch her buttock since her view would have been obstructed by an aft-facing victim.

39     It was further submitted that the victim and PW2 also gave conflicting accounts as to who asked PW3 to go to the back galley of the plane to write the note. It was highlighted by the Defence that the victim testified that she had asked PW2 to approach PW3. However, PW2 testified that it was the victim herself who had approached PW3.

40     It was the Defence’s case that at best, these material inconsistencies suggested that the victim’s recollection of the events at the material time was no more than tentative and uncertain. While the Defence acknowledged the position that human fallibility in observation, retention, and recollection is oftentimes inevitable in weighing the evidence of a witness, it was submitted that these were not merely minor discrepancies. Rather, they undermine the veracity of the victim’s evidence on the key events at the heart of the charges. This raises considerable doubt as to whether the conviction could be sustained.

41     It was submitted that the material inconsistencies in PW2’s evidence must also be seen in the context of her relationship with the victim. It is uncontroversial that an eyewitness needs to be “_independent, objective and credible_”: _Public Prosecutor v Thompson Matthew[^1]_at \[26\]. It was the Defence’s case that PW2 could not be considered to be independent, given her professional relationship with the victim who also assisted PW2 by intervening in her altercations with the accused. Taken together with the material inconsistencies highlighted above, it was submitted that PW2’s evidence could not be said to be “_independent, objective and credible_”.

#### The victim’s evidence was bereft of internal consistency

42     It was the Defence’s case that the victim’s own account of the events had shifted constantly ever since the flight landed on 2 November 2017. Shortly after the plane landed and the accused was escorted out of the plane, the victim was interviewed by PW5. Based on this interview, PW5 had prepared the Duty Controller Report (Aviation) (_Exhibit P6_). In the report, the section under the heading “Brief facts” comprises information that which the victim had communicated to PW5 during the interview. It was submitted in the report the victim had only alleged that the accused had touched her face.

43     It was highlighted by the Defence that was approximately 16 hours after the flight landed at around 8.14am (Singapore time) the victim had purportedly prepared a report titled “Assessment Summary” (_i.e._, **Exhibit P1**). It was submitted that in this report, the victim’s version of events had changed drastically. It was further submitted that her allegations against the accused now went beyond the touching of her face to include the attempt to grab on to her right arm, putting his left hand on top of her right thigh, and the touching of her backside.

44     It was the Defence’s case that the victim had alleged in this report that PW3 had witnessed “_the whole situation_”, which, read in context, would presumably include at least the accused allegedly using his right hand to grab the victim’s right arm, and that she had avoided this. It was submitted that PW3 had not said that she saw the accused using his right hand to grab the victim’s right arm, whether in the note (_Exhibit P2_) or when she gave evidence during the trial.

45     It was the Defence’s case that during the trial, the victim’s version of the facts changed yet again when she was giving evidence on the stand. It was submitted that for the first time the victim had stated that:

> (i)     the accused asked her where she lived;

> (ii)     the accused grabbed her arms before using his hands to touch her face;

> (iii) the accused used both hands to touch her face; and

> (iv) the accused grabbed the victim’s arms only after the touching of the face.

46     It was submitted that it is evident from the above that the victim’s evidence has been constantly shifting from the time she first described the incident in detail to PW5 to the trial. It was further submitted that worryingly the changes in her evidence relate to material aspects of her evidence as they involved the alleged acts committed by the accused. It was the Defence’s case that the changes also mostly relate to additional acts that were allegedly committed by the accused notwithstanding that the incident should have been fresher in her mind in the immediate aftermath (as admitted by the victim herself). In light of this, it was submitted that serious questions have been raised as to the victim’s credibility and the Court should be extremely circumspect about her evidence.

#### PW3’s evidence was unreliable and does not advance the Prosecution’s case against the accused

47     It was submitted that the lighting was generally dimmed and PW3 was tired and trying to sleep at the material time. The flight in question was a night flight, having departed Cochin at approximately 1.31 a.m. (Cochin time). According to the Defence, this would have two implications on the present case: the state of alertness of PW3 and the lighting conditions in the plane at the material time.

48     It was highlighted by the Defence that PW3 had admitted that she was tired and trying to sleep at the material time. It was submitted that the upshot of PW3’s evidence was that she may not have been paying particular attention to the interactions between the accused and the victim at the material time. In this regard, PW3 had said that she could not remember whether it was on more than one occasion where the victim knelt down next to the accused to speak to him.

49     It was the Defence’s case that although PW3 had testified that she remembered the incident when the accused allegedly touched the victim, there were material inconsistencies between the victim’s evidence and PW3’s evidence. Firstly, the victim had given evidence that she had “_raise_\[d\] \[her\] _voice and said ‘Sir, Sir, Sir’_” after the accused allegedly cupped her face. It was submitted that PW3 would have been able to hear the victim say this if she had been paying attention to what was going on between the accused and the victim. However, PW3 did not mention this at all. Secondly, not only did PW3 not witness any of the acts which the accused was charged with, she also testified, on no less than six occasions, that any contact she might have seen was solely on the victim’s back.

50     Accordingly, it was the Defence’s case that PW3’s evidence did not advance the Prosecution’s case against the accused with respect to the charges. It was submitted that PW3’s evidence plainly contradicted the evidence given by the victim and PW2, both of whom did not testify that the accused had touched the victim’s back. It was further submitted that the Prosecution had also not led any other evidence that the accused had touched the victim’s back or did so intending to outrage or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby outrage the modesty of the victim.

51     Moreover, as this was a night flight, it was the Defence’s case that the lighting on board the aircraft was generally dimmed. In this regard, it was submitted that both the victim and PW2 had confirmed that the aisle lights were dimmed. Although both of them had said that the lights in the galley were switched on, this could not be confirmed by PW3, who was only able to give the vague description that she “_can see_” despite not being able to remember the lighting conditions. It was further submitted that in any event, even assuming that lights in the galley were switched on at the galley and the curtains were not drawn, the fact remains that the lighting in the area where the accused was seated was far from ideal. In this regard, the victim had confirmed that the lighting at the material time was not the same as the lighting shown in photographs, which illustrated the lighting conditions during a day flight. It was highlighted by the Defence that the victim and PW3 had given conflicting accounts as regards to the victim’s kneeling position. This suggested that PW3 could not actually see clearly due to the dim lighting conditions at the time. PW3 testified that the victim was kneeling with “_1 knee on the floor in an angle facing_ \[the accused\].However, the victim had stated that she actually had both knees on the floor.

52     It was submitted in the course of the trial, the Prosecution had sought to rely on _Exhibit P2_, a handwritten note written by PW3 as evidence of the charges against the accused. At the time PW3 wrote her note in _Exhibit P2_, she was only asked to write down what she had seen / observed. She was never specifically asked at this time whether she saw the accused touch the victim. It was the Defence’s case that this would explain why PW3 wrote _Exhibit P2_ the way she did – she did not believe at this time that the accused had touched the victim. It was submitted that according to the victim’s own evidence, she had not mentioned the alleged touching to PW3 before she asked PW3 to write down what she saw. It was further submitted that PW3’s evidence was also that she was only asked to write down what she had seen generally – she was not asked about the alleged touching at this time. It was the Defence’s case that minimal weight should therefore be accorded to PW3’s handwritten note.

#### The Court cannot discount the possibility of innocent infection having taken place amongst the Prosecution’s key witnesses

53     It was the Defence’s case that another consideration that militates against reliance on the evidence of the victim, PW2 and PW3 namely, the possibility that the evidence and recollection of each witness had been infected, albeit innocently, by each other. It was submitted that the law on the doctrine of innocent infection is not novel had had referred to _AOF v Public Prosecutor[^2]_ at \[211\].

54     It was further submitted that the doctrine extends to any communications, even those that have been made, without malign intent, between the witnesses that may lead to the transfer of recollections between them. It was highlighted by the Defence in _Lee Kwang Peng v Public Prosecutor[^3]_, the High Court held at \[97\] that, in such a scenario:

> “The duty of the trial judge is to consider the evidence of the complainants and to assess the risk and opportunity for contamination. The trial judge must them ask himself or herself what weight is to be attached to the testimony of the witnesses in light of the assessment. The final question is whether that evidence, together with the other evidence before the court, satisfies the standard of proof required of the Prosecution.”

55     It was the Defence’s case that it could not be discounted that the testimonies of the victim, PW2 and PW3 had been infected, however innocently, by the interactions that took place at the back galley. It was submitted that it could very well have been the case PW3 formed the belief that the accused had touched the victim only after she had spoken further with the victim and PW2 when she became aware of the allegations that they were making against the accused. According to the Defence up until that point, PW3 only believed that the accused was a nuisance on the flight, which was exactly the situation she had described and written down in _Exhibit P2_, although this could have led her to be subconsciously prejudiced against the accused. Upon hearing the allegations that were made against the accused, PW3 could then have been too quick to jump to conclusions. It was further highlighted that the victim herself had acknowledged that PW3 had seen the earlier argument between PW2 and the accused about the payment of the in-flight meal. It was the Defence’s case that in the circumstances, the Court should place minimal weight (if any at all) on PW3’s evidence.

#### Evasive, inconsistent and implausible evidence given by the victim and PW2 on the Feedback Form

56     The Defence next referred to the photographs of the Feedback Form, and the screenshots of the accompanying metadata of the photographs (**_Exhibit D2_**) and its significance to the proceedings. It was highlighted by the Defence that while the Court did allow the photographs to be admitted into evidence, it was acknowledged that the Court retains the discretion to decide the appropriate amount of evidential weight it bears. It was submitted that the photographs of the Feedback Form should be accorded significant weight.

57     It was submitted that the photographs of the Feedback Form – and the Feedback Form itself, as imaged in the same – constitute documentary evidence. Such evidence “_will usually enjoy greater weight since it will not suffer from infirmities of recollection and narration_”[^4]. It was further submitted that where a document is produced electronically by a device or process that ordinarily produces or accurately communicates an electronic record, the Court should presume, subject to any contrary evidence, that the device or process produced or accurately communicated the said electronic record. It was highlighted by the Defence that s 116A(1) Evidence Act (Cap. 97, Rev. Ed. 1997) provides:

> _“_Unless evidence sufficient to raise doubt about the presumption is adduced, where a device or process is one that, or is of a kind that, if properly used, ordinarily produces or accurately communicates an electronic record, the court shall presume that in producing or communicating that electronic record on the occasion in question, the device or process produced or accurately communicated the electronic record_._”

58     Essentially, it was the Defence’s case that the presumption set out in s 116A(1) Evidence Act had not been displaced by the Prosecution. It was submitted that as the Prosecution had not adduced evidence necessary to rebut this presumption, the Court should conclude that the HTC phone did produce and accurately communicated the photographs in _Exhibit D2_ and _Exhibit D3_ at the material times. It was also submitted that the Feedback Form had been completed and subsequently imaged on the HTC phone by the accused during the flight. According to the Defence, this resolved a key factual difference between the Prosecution’s witnesses and the accused as to whether a Feedback Form was ever given and completed by the accused on the flight.

59     It was highlighted by the Defence that generally the victim’s and PW2’s evidence amounted to a total denial of any knowledge pertaining to the Feedback Form. It was submitted that when queried, both witnesses were unequivocal and unanimous in disavowing any knowledge of whether a feedback form was ever given to the accused. It was the Defence’s case that the victim’s evidence had vacillated in several notable ways. Firstly, she had testified that she could not remember whether a passenger feedback form was ever provided to the accused, a position she had maintained twice. Subsequently, when given the opportunity to peruse through the Feedback Form on the stand, she had indicated that she recognised the Feedback Form as the Scoot passenger feedback form. At this juncture, her evidence had shifted slightly, with her acknowledging that a feedback form might have been given to the accused after all. She had indicated that she might have given it to PW7 and that PW7 had asked her for it. It was highlighted by the Defence when asked to clarify this shift in her evidence the victim’s explanation was ambiguous and unconvincing.

60     The Defence then went on to set out the external consistency of the victim’s recollection _vis-à-vis_ PW7 with his testimony and the various shifts in her evidence. It was submitted that besides being internally inconsistent, the victim’s evidence was also, crucially, at odds with the evidence given by her fellow Scoot colleague, PW7. It was the Defence’s case that what is apparent from the foregoing was that the victim’s evidence was evasive, and fraught with persistent and laboured attempts to distance herself, as far as possible, from the Feedback Form and the accused’s completion of the same. According to the Defence, these attempts, however, were often inconsistent, illogical, and ultimately implausible. It was highlighted by the Defence that the starkest instance of external inconsistency in the victim’s evidence was that the Feedback Form, which was given to and completed by the accused who then submitted it to the victim had gone missing. It was submitted that the victim’s and PW2’s denial of knowledge pertaining to the Feedback Form was plainly contradicted by the images set out in _Exhibit D2_. It was further submitted that this was a significant discrepancy, and one that consequently cast significant doubt on the credibility of both witnesses.

#### It cannot be discounted beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim and PW2 had colluded to make a false complaint against the accused

61     It was the Defence’s case that considerable and unresolved doubt surrounded the evidence put forward by the Prosecution’s witnesses, in particular that of the victim and PW2. It was submitted that it could not be convincingly discounted that the accused was falsely implicated by them. It was submitted that both of them had a plausible motive to falsely implicate the accused. Firstly, as both of them were aware that the accused was dissatisfied with the service he had received on the flight, this would have been of concern for them. It was not inconceivable that had the accused been able to follow through with his formal complaint against PW2 as he had intended, both of them would have had to account for the events that unfolded in respect of the disagreements to Scoot.

62     It was the Defence’s case that their conduct had evinced a desire to stave off a formal complaint from the accused. The victim had not only asked PW2 to apologise to the accused but she had directed PW7 to offer the accused a service recovery meal to “_calm him down_.” It was highlighted by the Defence that they were unsuccessful in pacifying as the accused as he eventually insisted on being provided with the means to lodge a formal complaint against PW2. It was submitted that with the Feedback Form having ‘disappeared’, and with the accused now the subject of criminal proceedings, the accused’s complaints against PW2 had all but faded into the background.

63     Secondly, it was submitted that the accused was a difficult passenger who had made frequent demands of the flight crew, who were operating under fairly stressful and tiring conditions, _i.e._, a night flight, and one with a medical emergency. It was the Defence’s case that it could readily be accepted that the accused did little to endear himself to the victim and PW2. According to the Defence, this only made it all the more plausible that both of them would seek to falsely implicate the accused. It was further submitted that it was immaterial that PW2 only recalled flying with the victim as cabin crew on two occasions as this was at best, a neutral factor. This applied equally to the fact that this was their first encounter with the accused in the course of their work. It was the Defence’s case that what was material was that all three individuals were involved in a series of altercations on the same flight together, and that the victim and PW2 plausibly had a common interest in suppressing the accused’s formal complaint. It was submitted that the burden should shift to and ultimately rests on the Prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that both of them did not falsely implicate the accused. In light of the numerous discrepancies and material deficiencies in their testimonies, it was the Defence’s case that the Prosecution was unable to do so.

64     It was submitted that even if the Court were to find that there was no plausible motive that would lead to the victim and PW2 colluding against the accused, that that was not the end of the matter. It was the Defence’s case that the testimonies of the Prosecution’s witnesses, in particular, those of the victim and PW2 were fraught with inconsistencies and gaps and often defied logic. It was reiterated that the Feedback Forms imaged in _Exhibit D2_ had evinced a significant discrepancy between the victim’s and PW2’s evidence that cast a long shadow over their credibility as witnesses. In the premises, the accused’s conviction was unsafe.

#### The accused’s evidence was credible and remained consistent under cross-examination by the Prosecution

65     It was the Defence’s case that after completing the Feedback Form, the accused had fallen asleep until the end of the flight and at no time had touched the victim as has been alleged. The accused awoke shortly after the flight landed, at which point the police arrested him. It was submitted that the accused’s evidence was not only substantially internally consistent, it was, crucially, externally consistent, particularly with respect to his evidence regarding the Feedback Form.

66     It was highlighted by the Defence that at various junctures of the accused’s cross-examination, the Prosecution had sought to juxtapose his testimony against the cross-examination of the Prosecution’s witnesses by his Defence counsel. It was suggested to the accused that to the extent that certain facts in his evidence-in-chief had not been put, on the accused’s instructions, to the Prosecution’s witnesses by the Defence, this must mean that he was not a witness of truth.

67     It was the Defence’s position that the Prosecution was misconceived. According to his Counsel, when an accused person elects to engage counsel in his defence, it follows that the conduct of cross-examination at trial is, in the ordinary course of things, entrusted to said counsel. While an accused person may certainly provide input in this process, this was not the sole determinant of what guides the counsel’s cross-examination. Ultimately, the decisions on what should be put to a witness and what not to put are made by the accused’s counsel and this was an eminently reasonable position for an accused person to take, and one which facilitates the efficient and orderly conduct of the adversarial trial process. Accordingly, it was submitted that whatever the alleged discrepancies between the accused’s testimony and his Counsel’s cross-examination of the Prosecution’s witnesses on the other should have little to no bearing on the evaluation of the accused’s credibility.

68     It was further submitted that in any event, the rule in _Browne v Dunn[^5]_ does not mandate that every point be put to a witness. Rather, only submissions “_at the very heart of the matter_” must be put. It was the Defence’s case that in a similar vein, the fact that a version of events had not been challenged did not, _ipso facto_, mean that a party has admitted that what the witness has said is true. It was also the Defence’s case that the alleged discrepancies that were highlighted by the Prosecution to the accused during his cross-examination had not gone to the “_heart_” of his defence.

69     It was the Defence’s case that the “_very heart_” of the accused’s defence with respect to the first disagreement was that he did get into an altercation with PW2 regarding his decision to sit at Seat 30C. This, in turn, provided the context that exacerbated his reaction to the second disagreement, culminating in his formal complaint _via_ the Feedback Form. It was submitted that this and the attendant implications of the Feedback Form having mysteriously disappeared despite evidence that the accused had filled up such a form, was canvassed with and put to, the victim.

70     It was highlighted by the Defence that it was put to the accused that his evidence that he had requested the Feedback Form from the victim “_many, many times_” was not borne out in the victim’s cross-examination by the Defence. In response, it was submitted that the Defence’s primary position was that this particular detail did not go to the “_very heart of the matter_” such that it must have been put to the victim. It was the Defence’s case that on the assumption for the sake of argument that it did, it was the Defence’s case that the victim did not require a further opportunity to explain her evidence, given her categorical position on the matter that she could not recall whether the accused had wanted to lodge a formal complaint against her, and that she had, in any event, never given the Feedback Form to the accused herself. Accordingly, in the result there was no procedural unfairness.

71     It was further highlighted that it was put to the accused that his testimony that he had taken a photograph of the Feedback Form in the presence of the victim had not been put to her by the Defence during her cross-examination. It was submitted that it was the Defence’s primary position that this particular detail, similarly did not go to the “_very heart of the matter_” such that it must have been put to the victim. It was the Defence’s case that the fact that the accused had taken screenshots of the Feedback Form had verified its existence was a key piece of evidence in his Defence. It would therefore suffice that this fact was put to the victim and the very screenshots (_i.e._, Exhibit D2) were shown to her. It was reiterated that the victim’s evidence on this matter was a categorical denial that she had ever passed the Feedback Form to the accused. This would mean that, had the accused’s particular evidence on this point been put to the victim she would likely reiterate her denial, and take the position that she had not been in the presence of the accused as he took his photographs of the Feedback Form.

72     The Prosecution had put to the accused that he had made no mention of the Feedback Form, the screenshots the accused had evincing the Feedback Form; and/or the difficulties he had experienced in operating the HTC Phone in the course of his statements to PW6. In this connection, it was put to the accused that he was “_continually embellishing_ \[his\] _defence.”_

The Defence had clarified that the accused’s evidence was that he did in fact sought to highlight his disagreement with PW2 as well as his consequent desire to lodge a complaint against her to PW6 in the course of his statement-taking. It was submitted that this much was apparent from the accused’s long statement (**_Exhibit P34_**), which traverses, at length, the circumstances of the two disagreements.

73     It was further submitted that PW6 had testified that during the accused’s interview immediately upon arrival into Singapore that he had observed that the accused was very argumentative as he kept on saying that it was a service issue and had not touched the victim. It was the Defence’s case that the Prosecution therefore could not suggest that the accused’s dissatisfaction with the service he received on the flight was a belated contrivance. It was evident that, as a matter of substance, the accused had raised the matters relating to the two disagreements to PW6 at an early stage. It was highlighted that the Prosecution’s true complaint was far narrower, and pertained specifically to the form (quite literally) in which the accused had communicated the two disagreements to Scoot, _i.e._, the Feedback Form.

74     It was highlighted by the Defence that on the stand, the accused had candidly accepted that the Feedback Form was not reflected in the actual text of his statements. _A fortiori_, his screenshots of the Feedback Form, _i.e._, _Exhibit D2_, and the technical details he experienced with the HTC Phone, were similarly not expressly set out in his statements. It was the Defence’s position that the critical question which follows was whether these omissions in his written statements adversely impact his credibility and it was the Defence’s position that it did not.

75     It was the Defence’s case that the accused’s evidence was that he had attempted to orally discuss his complaints against PW2 with PW6. However, PW6 had indicated to the accused that this was not relevant to his defence. It was submitted that in fact, the accused’s evidence was that, on 2 November 2017, he had informed PW6 of the screenshots on the HTC phone evincing the Feedback Form, and had endeavoured to show him the same. However, the accused had encountered technical difficulties with his phone and was unable to do so. It was further submitted that when PW6 was recalled to the stand, he had corroborated several key aspects of the accused’s evidence. PW6 had clarified that the accused did seek to show him his phone during the taking of his cautioned statements (_Exhibits P35_ to _P37_) on 21 February 2018, albeit he also ran into some technical issues. As PW6 had noted, the accused was unable to turn on the phone despite his attempts. It was highlighted by the Defence that as regards the accused’s evidence that his hand phone battery was flat during the taking of his long statement (_Exhibit P34_) on 2 November 2017, PW6 had not contradicted this and had simply stated his inability to recall.

76     Although it was acknowledged by the Defence that PW6 had testified that the accused had not informed him that he had filled up the Feedback Form or the screenshots evincing the same, it was highlighted that PW6’s evidence was also that he was prepared to take a look at what the accused had to show him if the accused could turn the phone on”. It was submitted that PW6 had not made any attempt to ask the accused what was on the phone. PW6 had also testified that he never once contemplated that what the accused was endeavouring to show him could be material to the accused’s defence

77     It was the Defence’s case that PW6’s evidence in this respect was unconvincing. The accused had been called down to the Airport Police Division for the express purpose of taking his cautioned statements. The accused had spent over half an hour trying, with the assistance of his bailor, to get his phone to work, so that he could “_show something”_ to PW6. It was submitted that to any reasonable observer, it may be safely inferred that the accused was trying to furnish something that was, at minimum, plausibly relevant to his responses to the allegations mounted against him.

78     It was submitted that the accused was ostensibly, holding up the taking of his cautioned statements for half an hour. It was suggested by the Defence that it was highly unlikely and indeed, inexplicable that any IO would have permitted such a delay without at least some reason being proffered by the accused. It was further submitted if PW6 had not deemed it fit on 21 February 2018 to ask of the accused what was in the phone, even once, notwithstanding the half hour delay, it could only be because the accused had without prompting, told him about the Feedback Form and/or the screenshots evincing the same. It was highlighted by the Defence that PW6 had acknowledged that the accused’s statements did not reflect the fact that both of them had conversed in Tamil, in addition to English. It was submitted that the Court should therefore exercise a degree of caution when assessing the accused’s written statements seeing as they do not necessarily represent the entirety of what was discussed orally between the accused and PW6.

79     It was submitted that even taking the Prosecution’s case at its very highest that the accused had tried, for half an hour, to show PW6 something on his phone but had not expressly mentioned to him either the Feedback Form, or the screenshots on the HTC phone that was still not fatal to the Defence. It was submitted that it is trite that an accused person need not minutely detail the defence he will be relying on at the trial. In _Roshdi v Public Prosecutor[^6]_, the Court of Appeal held at \[21\] that all that is required is for an accused person to state “_a material fact_” which will be relied on at trial.

80     It was the Defence’s case that the accused’s defence was founded on his denial that he had ever touched the victim as well as the two disagreements. The two disagreements were of some significance, given that they culminated in the accused’s decision to lodge a complaint against PW2. It was this complaint that gives rise to doubts surrounding the intentions underlying the victim and PW2’s allegations, and the truth thereof. It was submitted that it follows that the material facts was the accused’s denial, the two disagreements, and the accused’s complaint. It was submitted that all of these were canvassed in the accused’s statements. It was therefore unnecessary for the Feedback Form, _i.e._, the medium through which the accused had made his complaint to Scoot to have been specifically referenced in his statements.

81     It was submitted that the accused’s statements must also be seen in their proper context. At the time these statements were taken the accused had no reason to suspect that the Feedback Form had ‘disappeared’. It was the Defence’s case that the accused had believed that the Feedback Form that he had submitted to the victim was on its way to the relevant department at Scoot. The accused had testified that he had only learned that Scoot never received the Feedback Form subsequently from PW6. It was highlighted that PW6’s evidence was that he had only made the enquiries of Scoot’s security manager regarding the existence of the Feedback Form on or around June 2018. Thus, any communications with the accused in this regard could only have taken place “_after June_”, four months after the accused’s statements had been taken. It was submitted that given the information available to the accused at the material times, he could not have known that the very existence of the Feedback Form was even in dispute, much less that it would turn out to be a material fact in his Defence at the trial which was to follow.

82     It was further submitted that at best, the Feedback Form and the screenshots in respect of the same would have constituted evidence that the accused did, in fact, follow through with his complaint against PW2. It was the Defence’s case that it would have been neither intuitive nor reasonable to expect the accused whose profession does not involve any legal training, to appreciate the nuances and significance of evidentiary matters. Indeed, as the accused had explained on the stand, “_at no point in_ \[the statement-taking\] _process was_ \[he\] _asked what evidence_ \[he\] _had with_ \[him\].” Such a matter would have been more appropriately canvassed at trial, by his counsel. It was reiterated that in fact the accused’s evidence was that was precisely what PW6 had communicated to him, when he sought to bring up the issues relating to his complaint against PW2. In light of the foregoing, the Court was invited to find that the accused was, in fact, a witness of truth.

83     In conclusion, it was the Defence’s case that the three charges had not established on the evidence before the Court. It was submitted that the accused had boarded the flight with the simple goal of commuting from his country of birth to his country of work. As it turned out, this commute was anything but straightforward. On the flight, the accused had experienced not one, but two unpleasant and in his experience unprecedented service incidents, which greatly upset him. At the end of the flight, the accused had awaken to the sudden news that he was under arrest, and facing incredible allegations that had been shown to be wholly unfounded.

84     His Counsel had acknowledged that the accused was rather evidently, a disruptive nuisance on the flight. It was submitted that by all accounts, he was a strident presence, one that was difficult to ignore and even harder to reason with, in a challenging and tense environment already beset by a medical emergency. It was submitted that he has been accused of something far worse than being an unreasonable passenger. It goes without saying that the consequences of being convicted on the three charges have the potential to significantly alter his livelihood and future. It was therefore only fair and only right that, for such allegations to be sustained, the evidence supporting the same must be compelling and capable of excluding any logical doubt. It was the Defence’s case that in the present proceedings, this simply has not been the case. In view of the foregoing, it was submitted that the accused should be acquitted of the offences specified in the three charges.

## The Prosecution’s Reply

85     In response to the Defence’s Closing Submissions, it was submitted that the Defence had alleged that there were “material inconsistencies” in the victim’s evidence and between the victim’s evidence and the evidence of PW2 and PW3. Accordingly, it was the Defence’s case that the Court should disregard the victim’s evidence and ignore the corroborative evidence. It was the Prosecution’s case that a quick glance of these “material inconsistencies” would immediately show that these were minor and do not affect the evidence in any significant way:

86     It was the Prosecution’s case that it was apposite at this juncture to set out the law on discrepancies in witness evidence. It was reiterated that “discrepancies, may… be found in any case for the simple reason that no two persons can describe the same thing in exactly the same way. Sometimes what appears to be discrepancies are in reality different ways of describing the same thing, or it may happen that the witnesses who are describing the same thing might have seen it in different ways and at different times and that is how the discrepancies are likely to arise… In weighing the testimony of witnesses, human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection are often recognised by the court… what a \[court\] needs to do is consider the discrepancies and say whether they are minor or serious discrepancies.”(see _Cheng Siong Guat v Public Prosecutor_)_[^7]_.

87     It was submitted that the Court of Appeal in _ADF v Public Prosecutor and another appeal[^8]_ at \[24\] – \[25\] further emphasised that not all discrepancies are critical. In disagreeing with the defendant’s argument that there was a “systemic and widespread pattern of many inconsistencies coming together” which destroyed the victim’s credibility, the Court of Appeal had stated:

> “24    … Here while the Judge noted that there were inconsistencies in the victim’s evidence, he did not say that her evidence was unbelievable or concocted. Instead, **he expressly stated that the inconsistencies “were not critical, and they did not detract from the basis on which I have found \[ADF\] to be guilty on the charges: at \[8\] of GD 1. In my opinion, it is plain that even though ADF was acquitted of some charges this does not mean that the victim was not a credible witness.** Rather, it appears to me that the Judge was guided by caution and not the victim’s credibility, or lack thereof, in acquitting ADF of those charges.

> 25.    In any event, the fact that inconsistencies in the victim’s evidence surfaced does not mean that there was a “systemic and widespread pattern of many inconsistencies coming together” which ought to destroy her credibility altogether. The following observations made by Yong CJ in _Govindaraj Perumalsamy v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGHC 16</span> are instructive at \[30\] – \[31\]:

>> “Even if a few of these inconsistencies appeared to be material**, it is trite law that a flawed witness does not equate to an untruthful witness**. On this point, my observations in Lewis Christine v PP <span class="citation">\[2001\] 3 SLR 165</span>, **that innocent discrepancies must be distinguished from deliberate lies, bears remembrance**.

>> …

>> Furthermore, the trial judge had been mindful that there were inconsistencies in \[the complainant’s\] evidence but, having weighed them against the totality of the evidence, he nonetheless accepted \[the complainant’s\] evidence on the keys facts in issue. It is settled law that the trial judge is entitled to determine which part of a witness’s testimony remains credible despite its discrepancies and there is no rule of law that the testimony of a witness must be believed in its entirety or not at all. Reference may be made to the cases of Jimina Jacee d/o C D Athannasius v PP <span class="citation">\[2000\] 1 SLR 205</span> and Mohammed Zairi bin Mohamad Mohtar v PP <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 SLR 344</span>.”

>> \[emphasis added\]

It was further submitted that based on the established jurisprudence, it was clear that the Court should first examine if the discrepancies are actually material. Even if they are, it does not automatically mean that the witness’s evidence was to be disregarded in its entirety. The Prosecution then went on to deal with the purported inconsistencies raised by the Defence.

#### Alleged inconsistencies between the victim and the independent witnesses

88     It was highlighted that the Prosecution would only deal with the allegedly inconsistency on the direction the victim was facing when she felt a touch on the buttock and the alleged discrepancy in PW3’s handwritten note (_Exhibit P2_). It was further highlighted that the other inconsistencies were trivial and did not have a bearing on the crux of the matter, and/or had already been addressed in the Prosecution’s Closing Submissions.

89     In response with the Defence’s allegation that PW2 was not an “independent, objective and credible” witness because of her professional relationship with the victim, it was submitted that the case cited by the Defence, _PP v Thompson Matthew_[^9] did not aid its case. It was highlighted that this language of “independent, objective and credible” was used by the court in that case to find that the defence witness was not independent, objective and credible in his testimony. It was further submitted that in arriving at that finding, the court had relied on many aspects of the evidence for e.g. the accused and the defence witness had known each other for 7 to 10 years and the accused were good and close friends with the defence witness and his family, the material inconsistencies between the accused’s and defence witness’s testimony in court and the inherent inconsistencies in the defence witness’s testimony.

90     It was the Prosecution’s case that none of these issues surfaced in the present case. It was submitted that PW2 and the victim only had a professional relationship and only flew once together before the incident, there were no material inconsistencies between her evidence and the victim’s and there are no internal inconsistencies in her testimony. Further, the Defence has not raised any evidence to substantiate this claim that PW2 was not independent. It was further submitted that similarly the Defence’s claim of witness contamination was also a bare assertion that goes against the weight of the evidence and notably, was never put to any of the witnesses during the Defence Counsel’s cross-examination.

91     It was highlighted that the Defence had alleged that PW2’s evidence was inconsistent with the rest of the witnesses because she gave evidence that she saw the accused touch the victim’s buttock, but the victim was facing the back of the plane when she was touched. It was submitted that this discrepancy could be easily rationalised when it is seen that PW2 witnessed the incident at an earlier time and saw it in a different way from the victim, who did not herself see the contact. Upon a careful review of the evidence, the victim testified that _as she turned around_ and walked towards the back galley, she felt a palm touch her buttock. She did not see the accused lay his palm on her buttock. It was the Prosecution’s case that the victim’s testimony was that she felt the accused touch her as she turned to face the back of the plane. This is not far from PW2’s evidence that she saw the accused’s hand at the aisle when the victim was facing the front of the plane, and then saw him touch the victim who then turned back towards the galley.

92     It was the Prosecution’s case that these two perspectives were reconcilable once it is seen that they were observations from two different points in time (especially since the offending act took place very quickly). It was submitted that it was entirely possible that PW2 first saw the accused reaching his hand out towards the aisle to touch the victim’s buttock when the victim was facing the front of the plane, and almost immediately the accused turned to face the back of the plane and the accused’s hand moved to come into contact with the victim’s buttock which is entirely consistent with both their versions. This was especially since the touch occurred very quickly as the victim was turning around and the victim did not see the accused touch her buttock.

93     It was further submitted that as for the purported inconsistency between PW3’s evidence in court and the handwritten note (_Exhibit P2_), PW3 had consistently maintained under cross-examination that what she meant by the word “actions” in _Exhibit P2_ was that she had observed the accused touching the victim. According to the Prosecution, this was completely reasonable and made sense, especially when one reads _Exhibit P2_ in its full context, instead of analysing it with a fine-tooth comb as the Defence has done. It was submitted that the entire sentence read: “…just happened to _see_ a female crew onboard being _ill-treated_ by a drunk both by words _as well as by actions_”. It was also submitted that this captures all the salient points, what she saw, the fact that there was ill-treatment and this was in the form of an act. This was entirely acceptable given the context in which the note was given.

94     It was submitted that as testified by the victim, while they were at the back galley, before she asked PW3 to write down what she observed, there was no discussion with the PW3 on the touching of her head, face and buttock. Her reason for this was “because the passenger \[was\] observing, so \[she\] didn’t ask”, and they were talking about the incident in the “general sense”. Therefore, given this lead up, it was submitted that it was entirely reasonable that PW3 only stated that she saw the victim being ill-treated by the accused in action, instead of going into detail about what kind of inappropriate touching occurred. It was the Prosecution’s case that she was not asked to go into that and neither did she know that this would result in a criminal investigation at that time. In fact, for this very reason, the Court could be satisfied that there was almost no possibility of “innocent infection”, because none of the witnesses discussed the various acts of molest in detail with one another. It was the Prosecution’s case that nothing in the evidence supports this contention by the Defence.

95     It was highlighted that the Defence has put up an alternative case theory regarding the handwritten note by PW3 namely, that it was meant to complain against the accused’s disruptive behaviour. It was submitted that this not only goes against the weight of the evidence and contradicts PW3’s own evidence but troublingly, was never put to PW3 or suggested to her during cross-examination. Hence, this submission by the Defence should be disregarded as per the rule in _Browne v Dunn_.

96     As regards the Defence’s allegation that the lighting was dark because the aisle lights were dimmed, this has already been dealt with in the Prosecution’s Closing Submissions. It was submitted that the victim and the two witnesses were consistently clear in their evidence on this – the lighting conditions were not dark and the dimmed aisle lights did not affect anyone’s visibility.

#### Alleged inconsistencies in victim’s evidence

97     It was highlighted that the Defence alleged that the victim was internally inconsistent and constantly shifting because she said more in the Assessment Summary INAPPROPRIATE PAX BEHAVIOUR TO CREW TR 271 (_Exhibit P1_) than what was in the Duty Controller Report (_Exhibit P6_) and even more in her testimony in Court. It was submitted that this was misguided. To say that the victim’s evidence was constantly shifting showed a clear failure to appreciate the context and circumstances surrounding each of these evidence. The Duty Controller Report (_Exhibit P6_) was submitted by PW5 to his management during the daily panel meeting, and not by the victim. He had testified that the moment he was aware that the accused had touched on the victim’s face and she wanted to pursue the matter, he escalated it to his management, without going into the details of the allegation. It was further submitted that ‘The Assessment Summary’ (_Exhibit P1_) was the victim’s own report to her own management, and this was strikingly similar to the account she gave in Court, which lends credence to her account.

98     It was the Prosecution’s case that the alleged points raised in the Defence’s Closing Submissions were extremely minor and need not be stated in _Exhibit P1_ given that the report was intended as a eReport to submit to the company to notify the related department of what happened on board and should therefore be a succinct report of all the salient facts. It was submitted that these other facts which came up in her testimony in Court were not inconsistent with anything said in _Exhibit P1_ and could not be seen as material omissions, as these do not go to the crux of the molest allegation and were details led by the Prosecution for the victim to give a fuller picture of the circumstances surrounding the charges.

#### Response to the Defence’s Submission on collusion

99     It was the Prosecution’s case that the Defence’s assertion that the victim colluded with PW2 or any of the cabin crew to bury the feedback form was unsubstantiated and ultimately an irrelevant distraction from the key issues at trial. It was submitted that firstly, the Defence had failed to adduce any evidence of motive for the victim to bury the feedback form and fabricate this allegation, bearing in mind that the complaint was against PW2 and not her. It was further submitted that when cross-examined, the victim had testified that she “did not know” what would happen if a complaint is made against a member of the cabin crew, and such ignorance clearly demonstrates that she would have no reason to deliberately collude with the victim. It was the Prosecution’s case that the long drawn discussion on the existence of the Feedback Form was also a red herring because it did not go to the crux of the matter that according to the Defence was whether or not the victim fabricated this claim. It was submitted that quite apart from the question of whether the form exists, the Defence had failed to plug the gap of why would the victim fabricate such a serious allegation against the accused.

100    Secondly it was submitted that the Defence has sought to rely on the case of _XP v PP[^10]_ to argue that the test was whether there was a reasonable possibility of collusion. It was the Prosecution’s case that the case of _XP v PP_ did not lay down any such test on collusion. The facts and the basis of the finding for collusion in _XP v PP_ were entirely different. It was submitted that it was a case where several similar charges emanated from a few complainants who also gave evidence to corroborate each other. The defence had alleged collusion amongst the complainants. The district judge dismissed the allegation of collusion and convicted the accused on the allegations made by two of the complainants. She found that the evidence of these complainants were corroborated by the evidence of the other complainants. However, she had, nevertheless, apparently found the testimony of these complainants not credible in relation to the charges involving them and acquitted the accused of those charges. On appeal, the High Court held that if the district judge did not find the testimony of the other complainants credible, she could have erred in holding that there was no collusion amongst the complainants. The district judge thus left a legal void by not stating her reasons for acquitting the appellant on the other charges especially since she had dismissed the allegation of collusion.

101    It was submitted that in contrast, the present case concerned allegations from only one victim. PW2 did not separately make any allegation of molest against the accused. More importantly, unlike the complainants in _XP v PP_, her evidence was credible and there was no similar legal void in this case that would lend credence to any submission on collusion. It was the Prosecution’s case that the findings in _XP v PP_ were inapplicable to the present case.

102    It was highlighted that the Defence had also alleged in the Defence’s Closing Submissions that the Feedback Form casted a long shadow over the victim’s credibility as witnesses. It was submitted that the Defence had not raised any evidence to rebut the victim’s evidence that she did not bury the Feedback Form. It was further submitted that this contention was particularly ironic and incredulous given that the image of the Feedback Form (_Exhibit D2_) showed that the accused had actually thanked the victim in the Feedback Form. It was the Prosecution’s case that the victim had no reason to bury a Feedback Form that actually complimented her.

#### Response to Defence’s attempts to salvage the accused’s credibility

103    It was the Prosecution’s case that the Defence’s attempts to explain away the contradictions surrounding the first disagreement were unmeritorious. It was highlighted that in the Defence’s Closing Submissions the Defence had stated that it actually sought to transverse the circumstances of the first disagreement with the victim on three distinct occasions and therefore, there was no inconsistency between the accused’s evidence and the Defence’s case. It was submitted that this was plainly misleading because the accused testified that he had _personally told the victim_ of this first disagreement. It was further submitted that in all three occasions, the Defence ran a different case of either (i) PW2 told the victim about the first disagreement or (ii) the victim was not personally aware of this first disagreement.

104    It was submitted that this was significant because the Defence had indicated in their submissions that a substantial portion of the accused’s defence rests on both the first and second disagreements, given that these culminated in his decision to lodge a complaint against PW2. It was the Prosecution’s case that this was clearly an afterthought because the Defence ran a different case during its cross-examination of the victim. It was submitted that it was clear that the accused’s evidence had been shifting in this regard and it was the Prosecution’s case that he was clearly embellishing his defence to buttress his purported complaint defence. It was further submitted that the fact that the Defence now argued that it did try to canvass this during its examination-in-chief when it ran a different case altogether, was misleading and betrays their attempt to grasp at straws to remedy salvage the accused’s credibility. It was the Prosecution’s position that for the Defence to say that this was not at the “very heart of the matter” clearly contradicted its own submission.

105    It was submitted that the cardinal rule in cross-examination was that if the cross-examiner had adduced or intends to adduce evidence which in any respect contradicts the evidence of the witness being cross-examined, he should put the contradictory facts to the witness so that the evidence of the witness is put into contention (officially challenged) and the latter is given the opportunity to respond. If the cross-examiner fails to put his case to the witness, the court was free to regard the witness’ evidence as undisputed regardless of the nature of the cross-examiner’s case.[^11]

106    It was further submitted that this rule, derived from the oft-cited case of _Browne v Dunn_[^12] and adopted by the Singapore Courts, prevents parties from unfairly ambushing each other with evidence, and ensures that witnesses have the opportunity to respond to the cross-examiner’s case. This rule requires that:

> “\[w\]here a submission is going to be made about a witness or the evidence given by the witness or the evidence given by the witness which is of such a nature and of such importance that it ought fairly to have been put to the witness to give him the opportunity to meet that submission, to counter it or to explain himself…”_[^13]_

107    It was submitted that it stood to reason therefore, that when Defence Counsel cross-examines the Prosecution witnesses, they would canvass all grounds exhaustively and take pains to put their client’s case forward. They do this to ensure that they are not subsequently estopped from submitting on a particular case theory owing to their falling afoul of the rule in _Browne_. It also goes without saying that the accused would have a vested interest in ensuring that his case is fully ventilated and all relevant Prosecution’s witnesses are rigorously challenged.

108    It was further submitted that the Court must be extremely cautious in assessing the evidence when an accused takes to the witness stand and begins to reveal new facts or raise fresh allegations against Prosecution witnesses; accusations which Defence Counsel had not raised during the witness’s cross-examination. Quite apart from the obvious failure to comply with the rule in _Browne_, such late disclosure smacks of clear afterthought and embellishment. It was in this context that the Prosecution submitted that little weight should be given to the accused’s belated afterthoughts on the stand. It was the Prosecution’s case that the Defence’s attempt to reconcile the accused’s evidence with the Defence’s case in this regard did not hold water.

#### The Defence’s attempts to explain away the accused’s omissions in his investigative statements are unmeritorious

109    It was highlighted that it was the Defence’s contention in their closing submissions that the accused had told PW6 about the Feedback Form, had screenshots of the feedback form, had difficulties with the HTC hand phone and tried to discuss the same with PW6. It was the Prosecution’s case that this was against the weight of the evidence, particularly, that of PW6. PW6 had unequivocally given evidence that after the administration of the warning for the s 23 CPC statement, he had repeatedly told the accused to write whatever he wanted to write, and the accused did write his own statement but never once raised any of the abovementioned points.

110    It was submitted that PW6 had consistently maintained that the accused never told him any of this and he was not challenged on this during cross-examination by counsel. In relation to PW6’s evidence that the accused did try to show him something on 21 February 2018 during the recording of the cautioned statement, he had stated that the accused never told him about what he wanted to show him. It was highlighted that when confronted with PW6’s unequivocal evidence, the Defence contended it was unconvincing for the reasons set out in the closing submissions. It was further highlighted that none of these were put to PW6.

111    It was further submitted that once again, the cardinal rule of cross-examination applies, and the Defence must, if it intends to reply on evidence that contradicts the evidence of PW6, he must put these alternative/contradictory facts to PW6 so that his evidence is officially challenged. All the Defence’s assertions and/or inferences based on the recording time being half an hour etc, were never put to PW6 and therefore the Court was urged to give no weight to these assertions and/or inferences.

112    In conclusion, the Prosecution it was submitted that the Court should find the evidence of the victim, PW2 and PW3 credible and compelling, and should also give full weight to the corroborative documentary evidence. Conversely, it was the Prosecution’s case that the contrived and incredulous defence of the accused should be rejected. The Defence had not brought any material that raises a reasonable doubt and accordingly urged the Court to convict the accused on the three charges.

## The Defence’s Reply

113    In response to the Prosecution’s Reply Submissions, the Defence had reiterated the three key thrusts of the accused’s defence as articulated in the Defence’s Closing Submissions. Firstly, it was submitted that the material deficiencies replete in the evidence of the victim, PW2 and PW3 had created reasonable doubt as to whether the charges against the accused had been adequately proven. It was emphasized that these deficiencies were inherent to the evidence of these witnesses, and existed independent of any finding made by the Court on the Feedback Form. It was submitted that these deficiencies were sufficiently severe, in and of themselves, such as to wholly undermine the Prosecution’s case regardless of the conclusions arrived in respect of the Feedback Form.

114    Secondly, the evasive, inconsistent, and implausible evidence given by the victim and PW2 on the Feedback Form gave rise to especial doubt about their credibility and the truth of their allegations against the accused. It was submitted that this doubt exacerbated the innate deficiencies that had already existed in the victim’s, PW2’s and PW3’s evidence and made it even more unsafe to conclude that the accused was guilty of the charges. In this regard, it was the Defence’s case that the Court should accord the Feedback Form significant weight. It was submitted that the Prosecution has not adduced credible evidence to show that its allegations of tampering and doctoring are anything more than mere conjecture and fanciful speculation.

115    Thirdly, it was submitted that the accused’s evidence was credible and consistent, notwithstanding cross-examination and the Prosecution’s further efforts in the course of its closing submissions to discredit him. Accordingly, it was the Defence’s case that the accused should be regarded as a witness of truth. It was further submitted that this was an alternative basis upon which the accused may be acquitted and also existed independent of any finding made by the Court on the Feedback Form as well as any finding made by the Court on the evidence of the Prosecution’s witnesses. It was the Defence’s case that these three key thrusts taken individually or collectively, readily demonstrate that the evidence before the Court was too inconclusive for a conviction on any of the three charges to be safe.

116    It was the Defence’s case that a review of the Prosecution’s Closing Submissions revealed that the Prosecution had glossed over the material inconsistencies and defects in the evidence given by its witnesses. It was submitted that in addition, the Prosecution has failed to quell beyond a reasonable doubt, the sizeable disquiet that surrounds the possibility that the victim and PW2 colluded to false implicate the accused in a bid to discredit any complaints made by him about the service on the flight. In this regard, the victim’s evasive, contradictory, and implausible denial of the existence of the Feedback Form was particularly striking, given the contemporaneous evidence of the same. It was further submitted that in contrast, the accused had remained a consistent and credible witness throughout the entire matter and despite the Prosecution’s rigorous cross-examination.

117    It was highlighted that in the Defence’s Closing Submissions, the material deficiencies in the evidence given by the Prosecution’s key witnesses had been set out. In particular, the constant shifting of the victim’s evidence ever since the flight landed on 2 November 2017 until the trial had been set out. It was submitted that on the contrary, the Prosecution has sought to portray the victim as a credible witness. Nonetheless, it was Defence’s case that the Prosecution has not been able to address the material inconsistencies highlighted in the Defence’s Closing Submissions. It was submitted that the Prosecution had simply cherry-picked those aspects of the evidence that suited its case and glossed over the glaring inconsistencies.

118    It was the Defence’s case that the Prosecution’s assertion that the victim’s earlier account of the incident in the Cabin Crew Report was “_squarely consistent with her testimony in Court_” was incorrect. It was submitted that the changes could not possibly be explained by the frailties of human memory over the lapse of time because the changes mostly relate to additional acts that were allegedly committed by the accused. According to Counsel, if the accused had indeed committed the acts in questions, the victim should have been able to recall the matter with greater clarity in the immediate aftermath, and not have to supplement her earlier accounts only during the trial itself. It was submitted that even if it were truly the case that the victim’s recollection of material events was imperfect, when considered in light of the inconsistencies, there would be reasonable doubt as to what actually occurred on board the flight.

119    It was the Defence’s case that the victim’s evidence was highly questionable and even contradictory when considered with the evidence given by other witnesses. In support of their position, some examples of these contradictions were set out by the Defence. It was submitted that the Prosecution had placed emphasis on how the victim “_saw that \[PW2\] and \[PW3\] were looking at her_” and had allegedly witnessed “_the whole situation_”. If this were true, then it must naturally follow that PW3’s and PW2’s evidence would significantly and substantially comport with the victim as they were, after all, observing what was (ostensibly) the same events unfold at what was (ostensibly) the same time.

120    It was highlighted that PW3 had never corroborated the victim’s account of the alleged touching and in fact PW3’s evidence was that she saw the accused touch the victim’s back, and this act (even if true, which is denied) does not comprise any of the charges. As for PW2, she had testified that the victim was facing the front of the plane when the accused allegedly touched her buttock. It was submitted that this was contradicted by the victim’s evidence that she was facing the back of the plane when she felt a touch on her buttock. It was further submitted that if the victim was to be believed, however, there would have been no way for PW2 to have seen the accused touch the victim’s buttock, since her view would have been obstructed by an aft-facing victim.

121    According to the Defence, these contradictions had created eminently reasonable doubt, independent of the discrepancies revolving around the victim and PW2’s evidence on the Feedback Form. It was submitted that the contradictions in the victim’s evidence continued to exist with respect to the Feedback Form. For instance, the victim insisted during the trial that she never gave the accused the Feedback Form, albeit she did concede that she might have given PW7 a feedback form during the flight. It was highlighted this was expressly contradicted by the evidence given by PW7 who testified that the victim did not ever give him the form.

122    It was the Defence’s position that the “unusually convincing” standard of scrutiny did not apply to the entirety of the victim’s evidence as the Prosecution was not seeking to convict the accused on all the charges on her evidence alone. Nevertheless, it clarified that as explained by the High Court in _Public Prosecutor v Ridhaudin Ridhwan bin Bakri[^14]_, the “unusually convincing” standard is merely a “_cognitive aid_” and even where it does not apply, “the burden of proof remains indisputably on the Prosecution to establish each element of the charge beyond a reasonable doubt”. Hence, “it remains incumbent on the court to carefully examine all the evidence placed before it and determine if that legal standard of proof has been satisfied”. It was highlighted that to this end, the Court of Appeal in _AOF_ had stressed that “\[t\]he importance of granularly examining the facts in determining the outcome of contested criminal proceedings cannot be overstated”. It was the Defence’s case that based on all the evidence heard by the Court during the trial of the matter, the Prosecution has failed to discharge its burden of proof.

123    It was further the Defence’s case that the Prosecution’s position that the victim’s evidence was not subject to the “unusually convincing” standard of scrutiny at all because there are other witnesses who claim to have seen some of the alleged acts was incorrect. In _AOF_, the Court of Appeal embarked on a detailed examination of the evidence and concluded that none of the evidence which was presented as “corroborative” evidence actually corroborated the complainant’s evidence. Among other reasons, the Court considered that the evidence did not relate to matters which are the offences in the charges. There were also material inconsistencies between the corroborative evidence and the complainant’s evidence. It was argued that there were at least certain aspects of the victim’s evidence (including alleged acts that form the subject matter of the charges) which were entirely uncorroborated.

124    It was the Defence’s case that the “unusually convincing” standard would still have to apply to the following aspects of the victim’s evidence, namely:

> (a)     The victim’s claims that the accused touched her right thigh or held her right arm were entirely uncorroborated and not all of the Prosecution’s key witnesses have claimed to have witnessed all the alleged acts which form the subject matter of the first charge and second charge;

> (b)     Other aspects of the victim’s evidence which were material notwithstanding that they were not stated in the charges themselves that were uncorroborated namely, that the accused had asked her where she lived and her response as well as the accused’s utterance of the words _“you are so beautiful”_ to the victim. According to the Defence, these aspects are essentially the bare allegations of a single individual;

> (c)     Neither PW2’s nor PW3’s evidence supported the victim’s assertions at (b). PW2 had expressly stated that she could not hear the conversations between the victim and the accused. PW3 was similarly silent on the victim’s evidence in this respect;

> (d)     The victim’s assertions at (b) were not borne out by the Cabin Crew Report _i.e. Exhibit P1_ she had prepared on 2 November 2017;

> (e)     As the victim was disgusted by the accused’s remarks, it naturally followed that she would have reported it in _Exhibit P1_. It was submitted that there ought to have been no issues with her recollection, since the victim’s evidence was that she had prepared the Cabin Crew Report on the same day that the alleged incidents took place;

> (f)     The victim was completely silent when completing the Cabin Crew Report. It was submitted that this defied logic, and strongly suggested that the victim’s evidence on the accused’s alleged remarks was, in reality, no more than an afterthought;

> (g)     Following the Court of Appeal’s reasoning in _AOF_ at \[187\], given the material inconsistencies in the evidence given by the victim and the evidence given by PW2 and PW3, it was submitted that the Court should not treat the evidence given by PW2 and PW3 as corroborative of the victim’s evidence.

125    It was submitted that the upshot of the above was that the victim’s credibility as a witness was under considerable doubt. Moreover, this undermined the Prosecution’s ability to establish the knowledge requirement of the charges, to the extent that the Prosecution has placed significant reliance on the accused’s alleged remarks to the victim as evidence that “_he found her attractive_”, thus making it “_inconceivable that did this (sic) acts without the knowledge that it would likely outrage her modesty_”.

126    It was further submitted that PW7’s testimony that the accused had “_repeatedly requested for the \[the victim\] when \[PW7\] attended to him_” was no more than equivocal evidence of the accused’s knowledge and/or intention(s). It was the Defence’s case that even if the accused had made such requests, this could readily be explained by his desire to obtain the Feedback Form from the victim, the existence of which the victim had informed the accused of, albeit it took multiple requests from the accused before she eventually acceded to the same.

127    In response to the Prosecution’s Reply Submissions, it was the Defence’s case that the material inconsistencies in the evidence given by PW2 and PW3 could not be explained simply by reference to their physical positions on board the flight. It was submitted that the Prosecution has sought to downplay some of these material inconsistencies as “_perceived discrepancies \[which\] can be easily explained by the different perspectives given their position vis-à-vis \[the victim\]_”. It was further submitted that these were not the only two material inconsistencies which were highlighted in the Defence’s Closing Submissions and that there were numerous other material inconsistencies which the Prosecution has not addressed. It was the Defence’s case that by and large the Prosecution had only made sweeping references to the evidence given by PW2 and PW3.

128    It was the Defence’s case that the evidence of PW2, PW3 and PW4 do not corroborate the victim’s evidence. In response to the Prosecution’s reliance on AOF, the following points were highlighted by the Defence:

> (a)      _AOF_ was a timely reminder of the burden the Prosecution must meet in proving its case. The mere fact that a more “_liberal approach_” may be allowed with respect to the admission of corroborative evidence is not a substitute for the necessary quality that evidence must have in convicting an accused person. That evidence must be sufficiently convincing such as to preclude any reasonable doubt. It was the Defence’s case that the allegedly-corroborative evidence in this case does not establish the charges beyond reasonable doubt;

> (b)     The “_liberal approach_” which the Prosecution refers to in its submissions relates only to the relevance of the evidence and not its weight. It was highlighted that the Court of Appeal went on to observe in _AOF_, where corroborative evidence is not independent, “_this deficiency is likely to adversely affect the_ weight _of the evidence which the court concerned may accord to it_”;

> (c)     The importance of independence in corroborative evidence was also addressed in \[176\] of _AOF_, which further references, _inter alia_, the decisions of the High Court in _Lee Kwang Peng_ and _Khoo Kwoon Hain[^15]_. In _Khoo Kwoon Hain_, in particular, the High Court observed that where corroborative evidence “_originate_\[s\] _from the complainant_”, it is not independent, and accordingly has “_little evidential value_”.

129    It was highlighted the corroborative evidence that the Prosecution had sought to rely on includes:

> (a)     PW2’s account as to what she witnessed during the flight;

> (b)     PW3’s account as to what she witnessed during the flight;

> (c)      _Exhibit P2_ (_i.e._, the note handwritten by PW3 on board the aircraft);

> (d)      _Exhibit P1_ (_i.e._, the report allegedly lodged by the victim after the flight landed in Singapore); and

> (e)     PW4’s evidence as to what the victim had told him about the incident.

130    It was essentially the Defence’s case that PW2’s and PW3’s evidence (including _Exhibit P2_) was innately replete with material deficiencies. While it was acknowledged by the Defence that PW3 was an independent witness and would not have a motive to deliberately make false allegations against the accused, it was submitted that her evidence remains unreliable in light of the external circumstances on board the flight at the material time as well as her interactions with the cabin crew. As regards the material aspects of PW4’s evidence and _Exhibit P1_, it was submitted that they essentially originate from the victim and to that extent, would not be independent. It was further submitted that the Court should place little or no weight on the evidence given by these witnesses.

131    It was also the Defence’s case that the explanations proffered by the Prosecution in their submissions were based solely on the Prosecution’s own inferences of the evidence given and do not sufficiently address the discrepancies. It was submitted that in proffering the above explanations, the Prosecution was attempting to salvage the evidence put forward by its witnesses by patching various inherent defects in the same. However, it was further submitted that these explanations were inconsistent, speculative, and/or contradict the evidence given by the Prosecution’s own witnesses. It was the Defence’s case that rather than establish the charges with certainty, they only breed further questions and doubt. These defects in the Prosecution’s evidence thus could not be dismissed as mere “_perceived discrepancies”._ Accordingly, it was submitted that the Court should place minimal weight (if any, at all) on the evidence given by the victim, PW2 and PW3. When considered in totality with all the available evidence, these defects in the Prosecution’s evidence must give rise to reasonable doubt as to the accused’s guilt.

132    It was the Defence’s case that the Prosecution bears the legal burden to prove that there was no collusion between the victim and PW2. It was highlighted that the Prosecution had relied on the authority of _Goh Han Heng_ to argue that where there is an allegation that the victim had falsely implicated an accused person, the accused person must “_adduce sufficient credible evidence of a motive to cast a reasonable doubt on the Prosecution’s case_”. It was submitted that this was imprecise as a matter of law. It was further submitted that _Goh Han Heng_ must be read with the subsequent judgment delivered in _AOF_, where the Court of Appeal clarified that the more appropriate way of framing the evidential threshold at the first stage of the inquiry was whether the Prosecution’s witnesses had a plausible motive to collude to bring false charges against the accused person.

133    It was the Defence’s case that the statement in _Goh Han Heng_ should not be interpreted as requiring the accused person to prove a motive for collusion to a standard that is sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case. The Defence then went on to set out the circumstances on how the victim’s and PW2’s conduct had evinced a desire to stave off a complaint from the accused and how it could reasonably be inferred that they plausibly had a common interest in discrediting him so as to suppress his complaint.

134    It was the Defence’s case that the Prosecution had failed to discharge its burden to prove that there was no collusion. It was submitted that in considering whether there was collusion, the Court should take into account the material inconsistencies between the evidence given by the victim and PW2 respectively as well as their inexplicable denial of the existence of the Feedback Form. It was further submitted that the Court should place significant weight on the Feedback Form. When considered in light of the material deficiencies in the Prosecution’s evidence, it was the Defence’s case that there would be reasonable doubt that the victim and PW2 colluded to make false allegations against the accused. For completeness, even if the Court were to find that they did not collude to falsely implicate the accused, it was submitted that he should still be acquitted of the charges given the incredible evidence given by the victim and PW2 especially in relation to the Feedback Form.

135    It was the Defence’s case that the accused’s evidence remained consistent and credible under cross-examination. Although in the course of its closing submissions, the Prosecution went to great lengths to undermine the credibility of the accused, it was submitted that these efforts were ineffectual. It was highlighted that the Prosecution has submitted that the accused was “_clearly exaggerating the particulars_” of the first disagreement with PW2. It was also highlighted that the Prosecution also claimed that the Defence put up a “_completely different version when the Prosecution witnesses were on the stand_.”

136    In response, it was the Defence’s case that the accused had offered a credible explanation as to why he did not expressly reference the first disagreement in the Feedback Form. According to the Defence, the accused had considered the Second Disagreement to be “_more humiliating_”. It was submitted that there was no explicable reason, in law or fact, why a passenger in the accused’s position must meticulously, chapter and verse, recite every disagreement with the flight crew for his overall evidence on his dissatisfaction with the service of the same crew to be believed. It was further submitted that in any event, the Prosecution’s Closing Submissions do not address the fact the accused did recall material details of the first disagreement in his long statement to PW6.

137    In addition, in response to the Prosecution’s assertion that the Defence had put up a “_completely different version_” of events under cross-examination, it was submitted that this is an overreach. As highlighted in the Defence’s Closing Submissions, the material aspects of the accused’s evidence were put to the victim on three distinct occasions. Amongst other things, it was suggested to her that PW2 had “_chided_” and “_scolded_” the accused and further, had “_told_ \[the accused\] _to go back to his seat_”. It was submitted that this was generally consistent with the accused’s evidence.

138    It was highlighted that the Prosecution has raised questions about whether the accused had indeed “_repeatedly pressed the call light to request for the feedback form from \[the victim\]_”. In response, it was submitted that the number of times he had requested the Feedback Form while no doubt relevant did not comprise the “_very heart of the matter_”. It is therefore immaterial that the accused could not recall precisely how many times he had done so. It was the Defence’s case that this was only natural, given that, at the time of the accused’s testimony, it had been almost one and a half years since the flight. It was also noted that the Prosecution has also accepted this to be no more than a “_minor discrepancy_”.

139    Further, it was emphasized that there is no dispute even from the victim that the accused did want to complain about the service on the flight. In the premises, it was the Defence’s case that it would be plainly unnecessary to cross-examine her on the question of whether the accused had intended to complain. It was highlighted that the victim’s evidence on the Feedback Form amounted to a complete denial that she had ever given the Feedback Form to him. It was the Defence’s case that the existence of the Feedback Form itself, as opposed to the number of times he requested the Feedback Form, which goes to the heart of his defence.

140    It was highlighted that it was the Prosecution’s submission that the accused was “_very evasive when confronted with material gaps in his evidence_”. In response, it was submitted that the exchange cited by the Prosecution in its Closing Submissions did not reasonably evince evasiveness on the part of the accused. In essence, it was the Defence’s case that although the response might not have been the answer the Prosecution would have preferred, but it was by no means evasive.

141    In response to the Prosecution’s submission that the accused had cast “_aspersions_” on PW6, it was submitted that this was a generalisation which belies the evidence before the Court. It was emphasized that when re-called to the stand, PW6 had corroborated several key aspects of the accused’s evidence, including the fact that he had tried to show him his phone during the taking of his cautioned Statement on 21 February 2018, but was unable to do so because of technical issues. Given the significance the HTC phone had played in the present proceedings, it was submitted that it was reasonable to infer that the accused was, in all likelihood, trying to show his pictures of the Feedback Form to PW6.

142    The Defence had acknowledged that the evidence given by the accused and PW6 differed in some respects. It suffices to say that the mere fact that the accused’s evidence is at odds with PW6’s evidence does not _ipso facto_ make the accused evasive. It was submitted that were it otherwise, an accused person would by definition, be deemed evasive merely because his/her evidence does not comport with that of the Prosecution’s witnesses. It was further submitted that this could not be the case. It was the Defence’s case that the accused’s evidence had ultimately remained consistent and credible even under rigorous cross-examination by the Prosecution. In the circumstances, the accused should be regarded as a witness of truth. In conclusion, it was submitted that the Prosecution has failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty of the charges. Hence, the Defence requested that the Court acquit the accused of the charges.

## Evaluation of the Evidence

#### Section 354(1) Penal Code charges

143    In the present case, the accused faced three charges of outrage of modesty on board a Scoot aircraft that was en route from Cochin, India to Singapore, under s 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”) read with s 3(1) of the Tokyo Convention (Cap 327, 1985 Rev Ed) (“Tokyo Convention”). In essence it was the Prosecution’s case that on 2 November 2017 on board the said Scoot aircraft, the accused had used criminal force on the victim knowing it to be likely that he would outrage her modesty by the following acts, namely:

> (a)     holding the victim’s right arm with one hand and touching her face with the other hand, and cupping the victim’s face with his hands;

> (b)     placing his hand on the victim’s right thigh; and

> (c)     touching the victim’s buttock with his hand.

#### Prosecution’s Burden of Proof

144    From the outset, it must be stated that the burden always remains on the Prosecution to prove each and every element of all three of the proceeded charges against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt before the accused could be found guilty of the charges against him. In addition, based the facts before me this was clearly not an instance where the Court had to make a finding based on only the evidence of the victim and the accused only but a case where there were other evidence available for the Court to make a determination.

#### Standard of scrutiny

145    In the present case, I agreed with the Prosecution that it was made clear by the Court of Appeal in _AOF v Public Prosecutor_ that the “unusually convincing” standard of scrutiny for cases sexual offences did not apply to the victim. I disagreed with Counsel’s submission that this standard would still have to apply to the following aspects of the uncorroborated aspects of the victim’s evidence that relate to the charges as well as to the material evidence in the case.

### The Law

146    I agreed with the Prosecution that in order to convict an accused for outraging the modesty of another person, two aspects must be proven beyond reasonable doubt:

> (a)      _Actus reus:_ the accused had assaulted or used criminal force against the person;

> (b)      _Mens rea_: the accused had the intention to outrage the modesty of that person, or knew that his actions would likely outrage that person’s modesty.

147    In the present case, as the accused had disputed that he had used criminal force on the victim, he had denied _actus reus_ of the charges. If I make a finding that the accused did commit the acts stated in the charges, then the question was whether the accused knew it to be likely that he will thereby outrage the victim’s modesty. In this respect I was guided by the recent High Court decision of _PP v Mohd Taufik bin Abu Bakar and another appeal[^16]_ (_“Taufik”_) at \[37\]:

> _“37_      _To prove that the accused had sufficient knowledge for the purposes of the OM charge, it must be shown that the accused committed his acts on the victim whilst “knowing it to be likely that he will thereby outrage the modesty of that person” \[emphasis added\] (s 354(1) of the Penal Code). Here, the knowledge that is relevant is that of the accused, and the unexpressed feelings and thoughts of the victim is often irrelevant for the purposes of proving that knowledge. Furthermore, the accused’s knowledge must be assessed in relation to the alleged victim, as can be gleaned from the focus on the outrage of modesty of “that person”.”_

148    I now turn to the facts of the present case. It was the Prosecution’s case that there was overwhelming evidence of the offences in this case, _viz_ the victim’s internally and externally consistent testimony, corroborative testimonies from the Prosecution’s witnesses in the immediate aftermath of the assaults, coupled with the accused’s incredulous defence. According to the Prosecution, the victim was a witness of truth who gave a compelling, logical and unwavering account of the incidents in question. Despite rigorous cross-examination, she remained resolute and consistent in her account of the incident.

149    It was submitted that she was internally consistent in her evidence in that there was no embellishment in her description of each of the three instances of outrage of modesty. In fact, she was forthright in admitting that all three instances “happened very fast”. She was also fair to the accused in her testimony as she had readily testified that the accused did tell her that he wanted to complain against PW2 and she wrote down her particulars and PW2’s particulars on _Exhibit D1_ for the accused because he wanted to complain.

150    It was the Prosecution’s case that there was direct corroborative evidence in the form of two independent eye-witnesses who saw the accused’s offending behaviour. PW2 and PW3 testified that they saw the accused outrage the victim’s modesty. PW2 saw the actions that were the subject of the first and third charges, whereas PW3 saw the actions that were the subject of the third charge.

151    It was the Prosecution’s position that with respect to any perceived discrepancy in how the victim described the accused’s touches versus what the PW2 and PW3 saw, this was immaterial and did not affect the weight to the attached to their respective evidence. It was submitted that the perceived discrepancies could be easily explained by the different perspectives given their position vis-à-vis the victim. PW2 only observed the accused touch the victim’s face and buttock due to the position of the victim. It was further submitted that PW3 had only observed the accused touch the victim’s back (and not her buttocks) due to the fact that she was seated right behind the accused.

152    In stark contrast, it was the Defence’s case that the evidence of the Prosecution’s witnesses were internally inconsistent, contradicted by each other’s evidence and the available external evidence, and did not advance the Prosecution’s case against the accused. The possibility of innocent infection having taken place amongst the Prosecution’s key witnesses as well as reasonable possibility of collusion between the victim and her fellow Scoot staff to frame the accused to deter him from filling a complaint for poor service also formed part of the accused’s defence. It was also the Defence’s case that the Prosecution’s evidence fell short of the requisite standard of proof required to convict the accused.

153    It was the Defence’s case that there were deficiencies innate to the evidence put forward by the Prosecution’s key witnesses that included:

> (i)     the material inconsistencies between the victim’s evidence and the evidence given by other key Prosecution witnesses,

> (ii)     the fact that the victim’s account of the incident has been shifting in material aspects since the date the flight landed in Singapore; and

> (iii)     the unreliability of PW3’s evidence given the circumstances on board the flight at the time (and the fact that PW3’s evidence could have been tainted by innocent infection).

These deficiencies, in and of themselves, cast reasonable doubt over the Prosecution’s case.

154    In addition, it was highlighted by the Defence that not all of the Prosecution’s witnesses had professed during the trial to having seen all the alleged acts for which the accused was charged. It was submitted that for example, PW3 did not allege that the accused had touched or cupped the victim’s face, touched her right thigh, or held her right arm. PW2 also did not allege that the accused had held the victim’s right arm with one hand and touched her face with the other, or placed his hand on the victim’s right thigh.

#### Assessment of Evidence

155    In my assessment of the evidence before me, I was mindful that the Court had to scrutinise the totality of evidence before me before deciding whether to accept or reject the evidence and placing the necessary weight on the key facts in issue. In weighing the testimony of the witnesses before me, I was also mindful of human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection and then to consider whether the discrepancies were minor or serious discrepancies. As highlighted by the Prosecution, the court in the case of _Cheng Siong Guat_ had observed that “…no two persons can describe the same thing in exactly the same way. Sometimes what appears to be discrepancies are in reality different ways of describing the same thing, or it may happen that the witnesses who are describing the same thing might have seen it in different ways and at different times and that is how the discrepancies are likely to arise…” Further, it is settled law that I was entitled to determine which part of a witness’s testimony remains credible despite its discrepancies and there is no rule of law that the testimony of a witness must be believed in its entirety or not at all[^17].

156    It was the Defence’s case that the Prosecution’s assertion that the victim’s earlier account of the incident in the Cabin Crew Report was “_squarely consistent with her testimony in Court_” was incorrect. It was evident from the written submissions of the great lengths that Counsel took to undermine the evidence of the Prosecution’s witnesses by his long discussions on the discrepancies in the Prosecution’s evidence and his insistence that each aspect of the victim’s evidence had to corroborated chapter and verse by the independent witnesses before it could be accepted by the Court. It was also the Defence’s case that the Prosecution has not adduced credible evidence to show that its allegations of tampering and doctoring are anything more than mere conjecture and fanciful speculation.

157    After a careful scrutiny of the evidence before me, I accepted the Prosecution’s submissions that the victim’s evidence were both internally and externally consistent. While there were minor inconsistencies between her evidence and that of both PW2 and PW3, the inconsistencies were not critical. I agreed with the Prosecution that the perceived discrepancies could be easily explained by the different perspectives given their position vis-à-vis the victim as PW2 was in the galley while PW3 had been seated directly behind the accused. I also found that the view of the offending behavior was not affected by the lighting of in the cabin as there was sufficient light from the galley and the incident had occurred only five rows away from the galley.

158    I found that there was direct corroborative evidence from PW2 and PW3 who saw the accused’s offending behavior when they testified that they saw the accused outrage the victim’s modesty. I agreed with the Prosecution that PW2 saw the actions that were the subject of the first and third charges, whereas PW3 saw the actions that were the subject of the third charge. As highlighted earlier, human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection is such that no two persons can describe the same thing in exactly the same way. I did not expect both PW2 and PW3 to be able to give evidence on the offences that accurately matched that of the accused in chapter and verse. Although PW3 was seated just behind the accused, her ability to recall the events might also have been affected by the fact that she was originally asleep before the accused decided to make a nuisance of himself during his flight by his behaviour.

159    I also agreed with the Prosecution that there was contemporaneous reporting by the victim as immediately after the incident, when the plane was still mid-air, the victim had reported to PW4 that she was molested. It was submitted that this was corroborated by PW4’s testimony. He had also testified that she appeared shaken to him. In addition, the victim herself had lodged a report within 24 hours of the incident and I agreed with the Prosecution’s case that this account was squarely consistent with the victim’s testimony in Court.

160    I rejected the Defence’s argument that the testimonies of the victim, PW2 and PW3 had been infected, however innocently, by the interactions that took place at the back galley and as such both PW2 and PW3 were not independent witnesses. I agreed that PW2 and the victim were merely colleagues who had only flew once together before the incident and did not accept the Defence’s unmeritorious contention that they could have colluded to frame the accused in order to stave off a formal complaint from the accused for poor service as it was speculative and unsupported. I also found that PW3 was clearly an independent witness as she had not even seen the accused or the victim prior to the flight on 2 November 2017.

161    In addition, I did not accept the Defence’s contention that the handwritten note (_Exhibit P2_) by PW3 was meant to complain against the accused’s disruptive behavior and not to corroborate PW3’s evidence of the accused touching the victim’s ‘back.’ I agreed with the Prosecution that this not only goes against the weight of the evidence and contradicts PW3’s own evidence and it was also never put to PW3 or suggested to her during cross-examination.

162    On the facts before me, I found that the accused was an evasive and untruthful and had taken every opportunity to embellish his evidence with regard to his complaint. He had relied on the photographs of the Feedback Form, and the screenshots of the accompanying metadata of the photographs (**_Exhibit D2_**) in support of his defence that the victim and PW2 could have colluded to frame him and that PW3 had been innocently infected by her interactions at the back galley. I agreed with the Prosecution that the complaint and _Exhibit D2_ were irrelevant distractions to the issues before me. Accordingly although I accepted that the accused had intended to make a complaint against PW2 and the victim had facilitated this by providing their particulars in _Exhibit D1_, I placed little weight on _Exhibit D2_ as I did not regard it as material evidence.

163    On the facts before me, it was undisputed that the accused was a difficult and disruptive passenger who had pressed the call light for service on multiple occasions. It was further undisputed that the accused had consumed both wine and whisky during the flight and made frequent demands of the flight crew, who were operating under fairly stressful and tiring conditions, _i.e._, a night flight, and with a medical emergency. As part of service recovery, the victim as the CIC had sought to appease the accused when she attended to him on more than one occasion in response to his complaint of poor service by PW2. On the facts, I found that when the victim was kneeling across the aisle to attend to him, the accused had taken advantage of this as he had found her attractive and had intentionally used criminal force on the victim in the manner as stated in the three charges. I did not accept his evidence after completing the Feedback Form, the accused had simply fallen asleep until the end of the flight and at no time had touched the victim as has been alleged.

164    At the conclusion of the trial, after having carefully assessed the evidence before and considering the respective written submissions from both the Prosecution and the Defence, I was satisfied that the Prosecution has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt in respect of each and every element of all three of the proceeded charges against the accused.
