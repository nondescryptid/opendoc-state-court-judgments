\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9099/2019/01.\]

31 May 2019

### District Judge Kessler Soh:

1       Joshua Woon, a Singaporean currently 24 year of age, was involved in facilitating illegal soccer betting. He had an Internet master agent account from which he, together with an accomplice, opened agent accounts and player accounts for bets to be placed by punters. Substantial amounts of bets were received for soccer match fixtures in various soccer leagues, and the defendant received a 35% share of the profits. In the course of investigating these remote gambling offences committed by the defendant, the police also uncovered earlier (separate) offences in which the defendant was involved in offering bribes to induce a police national serviceman to gain unauthorised access into a police computer system.

2       19 charges were brought against the defendant. Following a plea offer by the prosecution he pleaded guilty to four charges, with the remaining 15 offences taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. On 18 April 2019 he was sentenced to a total of 3 months and a week’s imprisonment and a fine of $2,000 (which was paid). The defendant, through his counsel, filed the present appeal against the sentence on 2 May 2019. He is presently on bail pending the appeal.

3       The grounds of my decision are set out below.

## PLEA OF GUILT

#### Charges

4       The defendant pleaded guilty to four charges.

5       Two charges (the “**RGA Charges**”) were for engaging in a conspiracy to facilitate the participation by other persons in remote gambling. These were offences under s 9(1)(e) of the _Remote Gambling Act 2014_ (“**RGA**”) read with s 109 of the _Penal Code_ (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008) (“**Penal Code**”). The charges read as follows:

DAC-914435-2018 (10th Charge)

You \[...\] are charged that you, sometime in June 2016, did engage in a conspiracy with Tan Ke Da Paul (“Tan”) to facilitate participation by others in remote gambling, in accordance with arrangements made by your principal, one “Ming Long”, and in pursuance of that conspiracy and in order to the doing of the thing, an act took place, _to wit_, Tan created and issued a player account with the user ID “**30mqc112**” on the website http://www.water22.com, which is a remote gambling service not provided by an exempt operator or a person otherwise exempt under Section 40 of the Remote Gambling Act 2014 (“RGA”), which allowed one or more individuals to gamble using remote communication, _to wit_, on soccer fixtures between 14 September 2016 to 30 September 2016 with a total bet value amounting to **S$12,300**, which act took place in consequence of your abetment, and as a result, you facilitated one or more individuals to commit an offence under Section 8 of the RGA, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 9(1)(e) of the RGA read with Section 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

DAC-914436-2018 (11th Charge)

You \[...\] are charged that you, sometime in June 2016, did engage in a conspiracy with Tan Ke Da Paul (“Tan”) to facilitate participation by others in remote gambling, in accordance with arrangements made by your principal, one “Ming Long”, and in pursuance of that conspiracy and in order to the doing of the thing, an act took place, _to wit_, Tan created and issued an player account with the user ID “**30mqc113**” on the website http://www.water22.com, which is a remote gambling service not provided by an exempt operator or a person otherwise exempt under Section 40 of the Remote Gambling Act 2014 (“RGA”), which allowed one or more individuals to gamble using remote communication, _to wit_, on soccer fixtures between 14 September 2016 to 30 September 2016 with a total bet value amounting to **S$5,094**, which act took place in consequence of your abetment, and as a result, you facilitated one or more individuals to commit an offence under Section 8 of the RGA, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 9(1)(e) of the RGA read with Section 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

6       One charge (the “**PCA Charge**”) related to the corrupt offer of a gratification, an offence under s 6(b) of the _Prevention of Corruption Act_ (Cap 241, Rev Ed 1993) (“**PCA**”):

DAC-914443-2018 (18th Charge)

You \[...\] are charged that you, sometime in July 2016, in Singapore, did corruptly offer gratification, _to wit_, an unspecified sum of money, to an agent, Royce Phua Tai Da (“Phua”), a Staff Assistant of the Singapore Police Force (“SPF”), through one Ivan Sim Jun Jie, as an inducement for doing acts in relation to Phua’s principal’s affairs, _to wit_, obtain screening results from the SPF’s internal computer databases without authorisation, which acts you knew were unauthorised, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241).

7       One charge (the “**CMCA Charge**”) related to a conspiracy to secure unauthorised access to a computer system used by the police, an offence under s 3(1) read with s 10(1) of the _Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act_ (Cap 50A, Rev Ed 2007) (“**CMCA**”):

DAC-914444-2018 (19th Charge)

You \[...\] are charged that you, sometime in July 2016, in Singapore, did abet the commission of an offence by engaging in a conspiracy with Ivan Sim Jun Jie and Royce Phua Tai Da to commit an offence under Section 3(1) of the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act (Cap 50A) (“CMCA”), to perform a function for the purpose of securing access without authority to data contained in the computer system of the Traffic Police, Singapore Police Force, and in pursuance of that conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing, an act took place on 14 July 2016, at or about 2:57 pm, at No. 10, Ubi Avenue 3, Traffic Police, Singapore, _to wit_, one Joseph Yeo Peng Siong ran an unauthorised search on the NRIC number \[SxxxxxxxG\] in the Traffic Police’s CRIMES-2 system and accessed, without authority, data relevant to that NRIC number, which act you knew was unauthorised and which act took place in consequence of your abetment, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 3(1) read with Section 10(1) of the CMCA.

#### Facts

#### (a)   Arrest of defendant

8       On 30 September 2016, the defendant was arrested by the police. He was suspected of being involved in illegal gambling activity. His two mobile phones were seized. He was brought back to his home. There he admitted to the police that he had used his laptop and desktop to access illegal remote gambling websites. The laptop and desktop were seized as case exhibits. He was later taken to the Police Cantonment Complex to assist with further investigations. In the course of investigations, the defendant provided the URLs of two illegal remote gambling websites, as well as the userID and passwords of the corresponding accounts on these sites. The relevant betting records from these accounts were printed out as evidence.

#### (b)   RGA Charges – Facilitating participation in remote gambling

9       Sometime in 2016, the defendant got to know a person called “Ming Long”. “Ming Long” asked the defendant if he did any “side activities” (meaning, illegal activities). When the defendant responded that he had friends who were engaged in illegal soccer betting as agents, “Ming Long” offered to give the defendant an agent account.

10     The defendant subsequently asked his friends to see if anyone was interested in splitting the winnings and losses under the agent account offered by “Ming Long”. One of the defendant’s friends, Paul Tan Ke Da (“**Tan**”), took up the offer and agreed to find players and to split the operation of the agent account with the defendant.

11     The defendant then asked “Ming Long” for an agent account and a position-taking of 90%. “Ming Long” issued the defendant two accounts with a position-taking of 70% instead. This meant that the defendant and Tan would collectively bear 70% of the losses and receive 70% of the winnings from the sub-accounts under the two accounts.

12     One of the accounts issued to the defendant was a “master agent” account. A master agent account could create and issue both agent accounts and player accounts; an agent account could create and issue player accounts. The bets under both accounts and their sub-accounts were placed in Singapore dollars. Both the defendant and Tan had access to the accounts.

13     Between the defendant and Tan, they agreed to split their 70% position-taking with “Ming Long” 50-50: this meant that the defendant and Tan would _each_ bear 35% of the losses of and receive 35% of the winnings.

14     Tan was in charge of settling accounts with the punters. After doing so, Tan would settle accounts between him and the defendant. The defendant would collect his 35% share of the winnings and the 30% share of “Ming Long” from Tan. After that the defendant would text “Ming Long” and arrange to meet with him to settle their accounts.

15     Pursuant to their conspiracy, sometime in June 2016, Tan used the agent account to create and issue two player accounts (among others) on the illegal remote gambling website http://water22.com. The userIDs of these two accounts were:

(a)     “30mqc112” (DAC-914435-2018); and

(b)     “30mqc113” (DAC-914436-2018).

16     The provision of the two player accounts allowed one or more punters to access the illegal gambling accounts using the Internet and to place bets, which amounted to a total of $12,300 and $5,094, respectively. The bets were placed to forecast the results of soccer match fixtures in various soccer leagues.

#### (c)   PCA Charge – corrupt offer of gratification

17     Sometime in February 2016, the defendant and a close friend Ivan Sim Jun Jie (“**Sim**”) had a chat. They had met in secondary school and remained friends since then. Sim served his full-time national service with the Traffic Police (“**TP**”) as a staff assistant at the Serious Violation Investigation Team (“**SVIT**”), which he completed in June 2016.

18     During the chat, the defendant told Sim that he would pay Sim and another friend Royce Phua Tai Da (“**Phua**”) if they helped him perform unauthorised screenings using the police’s computer systems, for him or his friends in the future. (The defendant became acquainted with Phua through Sim. Phua served his national service with the TP as a staff assistant at the General Investigation Team (“**GIT**”).)

19     It was not specified how much would be paid.

20     Subsequently, sometime in July 2016, Sim and Phua were having lunch when Sim brought up the defendant’s offer of gratification to Phua. Phua did not verbally respond to Sim.

#### (d)   CMCA Charge – conspiracy to access police computer system

21     Following the defendant’s arrest on 30 September 2016 (above, at \[8\]), when the police screened the defendant’s mobile phones, they found a photograph of a CRIMES-2 search results page of one “Desmond”. (CRIMES-2 is a computer system maintained by the police to support its investigation work. The photograph had been sent to the defendant by Sim on 15 July 2016 via the WhatsApp chat messaging platform: the details are set out at \[28\], below.)

22     “Desmond” was a friend of the defendant. Sometime in mid-2016, Desmond confided in the defendant about some problems that he had encountered with a business partner. Desmond said that he was worried that this business partner would implicate him in some criminal wrongdoings.

23     The defendant decided to check Desmond’s criminal history to find out if Desmond had indeed been implicated by his business partner in such a manner. The defendant contacted Sim on or about 9 July 2016 and asked Sim to check on Desmond’s criminal history. He told Sim that he wanted to find out if “the person bearing this NRIC number has ever \[been\] involved in any Police case”. He also sent a WhatsApp message to Sim containing Desmond’s NRIC number (the “**NRIC Number**”) in order to facilitate the check.

24     (The defendant asked Sim to help him screen the NRIC Number knowing that Sim had served his national service with the TP and would have some means to access the police’s computer systems. He knew that he was asking Sim to help him perform an unauthorised screening and that it was an offence.)

25     Sim agreed to assist the defendant. But Sim no longer had access to the police’s computer systems as he had completed his national service. So Sim asked Phua (who was still performing national service) to help screen the NRIC Number. Phua agreed to help.

26     Phua did not have the authority nor the ability to access the CRIMES-2 computer system as he was not with the SVIT. So he approached another person, one Joseph Yeo Peng Siong (“**Yeo**”). Yeo was the replacement staff assistant for Sim at the SVIT (referred to at \[17\], above), and Yeo had authority to access the CRIMES-2 system for work-related purposes. Phua showed Yeo the NRIC Number on his mobile phone, and asked Yeo to help him screen the NRIC Number. Phua told Yeo that the screening was for work-related purposes, which Phua knew was not true.

27     Yeo proceeded to screen the NRIC Number using CRIMES-2 on 14 July 2016, at or about 2:57 pm. When he had completed the screening, he informed Phua. Phua then went over to Yeo’s work computer and took a photograph of the results of the CRIMES-2 screening using his mobile phone. Phua subsequently forwarded the photograph to Sim via WhatsApp messenger.

28     After Sim received the photograph from Phua, he forwarded it to the defendant via WhatsApp messenger on 15 July 2016. Sim informed the defendant on WhatsApp messenger: “Actually. Nothing leh. \[photograph of CRIMES-2 results\] His latest case was 2015.” When the defendant received the photograph of the CRIMES-2 screening results, he proceeded to inform Desmond that he had not been implicated by his business partner for any criminal wrongdoings.

#### Charges taken into consideration (TIC)

29     Apart from the four charges that the defendant pleaded guilty to, he also admitted to 15 other offences and consented to the offences being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. These were:

(a)     12 other offences relating to the facilitation of remote gambling, involving bet values ranging from $8.00 to $4,685, which were offences under s 9(1)(e) RGA read with s 109 Penal Code;

(b)     One offence of receiving an unknown amount of betting money from Tan and passing it to “Ming Long”, an offence under s 9(1)(c) RGA;

(c)     One offence of unlawful remote gambling in which the defendant placed bets of $3,769, an offence under s 8(1) RGA; and

(d)     The offence of corruptly offering gratification to Sim as an inducement to obtain screening results from a police computer database, an offence under s 5(b)(i) PCA.

## SENTENCE

#### Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

30     In respect of the RGA Charges, the prosecution sought a sentence of 3 months’ imprisonment for the charge with the bet value of $12,300; and 2 months’ imprisonment for the charge with the bet value of $5,094. An analogy was drawn between the present offences under the RGA and the offence under s 5(a) of the _Common Gaming Houses Act_ (Cap 49) (“**CGHA**”) of assisting in the carrying on of a public lottery. The primary sentencing consideration for offences under s 5(a) CGHA is that of deterrence: _See Choon Chye v PP_ \[1992\] SGHC 125 (at \[15\]), and this ought to apply to sentencing under the RGA. It was submitted that remote gambling offences were no less lucrative than “real-world gambling”, and were easier to engage in and harder to detect. It was also submitted that the severity of the sentences for illegal bookmaking offences under s 5(a) CGHA were linked to the _value of bets_ involved: _Lim Li Ling v PP_ \[2006\] SGHC 184 (at \[92\]), and this ought also to apply to offences under the RGA.

31     The prosecution submitted on various aggravating factors for the RGA Charges. The defendant was no ordinary agent. He and Tan had control over a master agent account and an ordinary agent account. Both accounts were capable of creating and issuing illegal gambling accounts to other persons. The total value of bets was significant: $17,394 for the proceeded charges alone, and $35,990 for all the charges including the TIC charges. The offences occurred over a period of about 3 months (from June to September 2016, until his arrest on 30 September 2016). It was a syndicated offence. The defendant was accountable to his upstream principal, “Ming Long”, and he had what was essentially a profit-sharing arrangement with Tan. The defendant was the one who started liaising with “Ming Long”; and asked Tan to join him in their illegal enterprise, and he was the one who initiated the profit-sharing arrangement with Tan. The scope of activity was not small: he and Tan issued a total of 14 illegal gambling accounts to various individuals (across the 16 RGA charges brought against the defendant).

32     In respect of the PCA Charge, the prosecution sought a custodial sentence of 3 weeks’ imprisonment. It was submitted that the key sentencing principle in all corruption cases was that of general deterrence. Even though there was no sum of money specified by the defendant as the gratification, this factor did not justify the imposition of a lenient or non-custodial term. The defendant was the main instigator of this corrupt offer to Phua (through Sim). He also faced a TIC charge for corruptly offering an unspecified bribe amount to Sim. It was submitted that the sentence imposed must be sufficiently deterrent towards him and other like-minded offenders who may be tempted to exploit contacts they have within the law enforcement agencies in order to obtain confidential information held within the Government’s databases.

33     In respect of the CMCA Charge, the prosecution sought a fine of $5,000 (the maximum fine). It was submitted that the key sentencing principle was general deterrence. The offence involved a deliberate and unauthorised breach into the SPF’s internal computer systems which contained confidential information. It was a group offence that involved three people (the defendant, Sim, and Phua). The defendant instigated the entire conspiracy. The offence was difficult to detect, and was not detected until the defendant was investigated for the (unrelated) offences under the RGA. Further, it was not simply a breach of the SPF’s systems but there was a subsequent leak of the information illegally obtained from the breach. Sim conveyed the information that he had received from Phua to the defendant, who ultimately conveyed this information to his friend Desmond. There was therefore some harm occasioned as a result of this unauthorised access into SPF’s computer system.

34     The prosecution also submitted that the higher sentence for the RGA Charges (3 months) run consecutively with the sentence for the PCA Charge, giving a total sentence of 3 months and 3 weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $5,000.

#### Mitigation plea

35     In mitigation, the defence submitted that rehabilitation was the primary sentencing principle given the defendant’s young age. The defendant had committed the offence under the PCA Charge when he was 20 years old, and the offences under the RGA Charges and the CMCA Charge were committed a few months after he had turned 21. It was submitted that the degree of wrongdoing for each of the offences was not serious. He was remorseful for his actions. He had rendered full cooperation to the police in the investigations. He pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity. He had no antecedents and was determined to turn over a new leaf with support from his close-knitted family. A non-custodial sentence was sought for the defendant.

36     (The defence initially urged the court to consider probation for the defendant. However, this was not an available sentencing option for the RGA Charges. This point is considered below, at \[40\]).)

37     In respect of the RGA Charges, the defence submitted that an appropriate sentence would be a (minimum) fine of $20,000 for each charge. It was submitted that the defendant’s participation was only limited to: (a) the opening of the accounts (the agent and player accounts); (b) obtaining a share in the winnings and losses; and (c) passing “Ming Long” his share in the winnings. He was not involved in the day to day running of the accounts, or the solicitation or collection of the bets. It was highlighted that Tan, who was also involved in this scheme, had been given (merely) a stern warning by the police.

38     In respect of the PCA Charge, the defence submitted that an appropriate sentence would be a fine of $5,000. The defendant’s comment that he would pay Sim and Phua unspecified sums of money if they helped perform unauthorised screenings in the future was made once in passing over a casual lunch and never repeated again.

39     In respect of the CMCA Charge, the defence submitted that an appropriate sentence would be a fine of $1,500. It was submitted that the defendant was several steps removed from running the search by the principal offender, Phua. The defendant’s role in the abetted crime was only limited to asking Sim if he could check if Desmond had a criminal record. Further, he requested Sim to do the search not for personal benefit but to help a friend. He had acted out of concern for his friend. It was submitted that the case was not so serious to warrant the maximum fine sought by the prosecution.

#### Sentencing considerations

#### (a)   Sentencing objective

40     In my judgment, considering the nature of the offences committed by the defendant, the sentencing objective of deterrence ought to take precedence over rehabilitation. Offences relating to the facilitation of unlawful remote gambling, corruption and the unauthorised access of confidential data stored in secure computer systems are all offences that must be generally deterred. While the defendant was of a relatively young age when he committed the offences, he was past the age of 21 years and was not a youthful offender.[^1] Rehabilitative sentencing options such as probation were not appropriate, given the gravity of the offences and taking into account the entirety of the defendant’s conduct in the offences committed. In any case it would not have been possible to order probation in respect of the RGA Charges given that it carried a specified minimum sentence (a fine of not less than $20,000 and not more than $200,000) and the defendant was more than 21 years of age at the time of his conviction on 21 March 2019: s 5 of the _Probation of Offenders Act_ (Cap 252).

#### (b)   Sentencing considerations and precedents for RGA Charges

41     In respect of the RGA Charges, the prescribed punishment for an offence under s 9(1)(e) RGA (read with s 109 Penal Code in the present case) is a fine of not less than $20,000 and not more than $200,000, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years, or both.

42     I accepted the submission of the prosecution that there were a number of aggravating factors. The defendant was the one who started liaising with “Ming Long”, and he subsequently got his friend Tan involved. It was a syndicated offence, and the defendant played an active role in the syndicate. He had a master agent account which was used to create accounts for other persons to gamble. He and Tan issued a total of 14 illegal gambling accounts to various individuals. The bet values were not insignificant ($17,394 for the proceeded charges, and $35,990 for all the charges including the TIC charges). He shared the profits with Tan, and also accounted to “Ming Long” for the latter’s share of the profits. The offences occurred over a period of about 3 months (from June 2016 until his arrest on 30 September 2016).

43     The precedents cited by the prosecution showed that a custodial sentence was generally imposed in such circumstances, even in cases where the offender pleaded guilty:

44     It can be observed that the length of the custodial sentence bears a broad correlation with the bet values involved. Where the bet values ranged from $9,000 to $15,000, the sentences imposed by the courts have ranged from 3 to 4 months’ imprisonment. For smaller bet values of about $5,000, a sentence of 2 months’ imprisonment has been imposed.

45     In the present case, an imprisonment sentence was necessary as a deterrent. The precedents show that even in cases where the offenders were relatively young, in their early 20s (such as _Luke Yeo Kim Poh_ (s/n 1) and _Lee Zixi Keith_ (s/n 2)) imprisonment terms of two months or longer have been imposed on comparable facts. In my judgement, the sentences of 2 to 3 months’ imprisonment sought by the prosecution in relation to the RGA Charges was fair and reasonable.

#### (c)   Sentencing considerations and precedents for PCA Charge

46     The prescribed punishment for an offence under s 6(b) PCA is a fine not exceeding $100,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.

47     In my judgment, a custodial sentence is warranted in the present case. Public sector corruption typically attracts a custodial sentence: _PP v Syed Mostofa Romel_ \[2015\] 3 SLR 1166 (at \[15\]). The defendant was the person who initiated the corrupt offer to Phua, a police national serviceman (through Sim). He also faced a TIC charge for making a corrupt offer to Sim. The defendant’s intent in offering the bribe was to procure unauthorised access into the secure computer systems of the police, which was an offence under the CMCA. Offering a bribe _to procure the commission of an offence_ was a particularly aggravating factor.

48     Some sentencing precedents highlighted by the prosecution were the following:

49     The precedents show that attempting to bribe a police officer is an especially serious offence. Even where the bribes offered were relatively small (in the range of $50 to $150) or where no bribe amount was specified, sentences in the range of 4 weeks’ imprisonment or longer have been imposed. While the precedents cited related to the more typical cases of bribes being offered to a police officer in an attempt to avoid arrest, the offering of a bribe to a police officer to do something that he was not authorised, as in the present case, is no less severe in terms of the offender’s culpability and the potential harm that may be caused. Hence the prosecution’s submission for a sentence of 3 weeks’ imprisonment for the PCA Charge was not inconsistent with the sentences imposed in past cases. I took into account, however, that the defendant was at a relatively young age of 20 to 21 years when the offence was committed. His offer of gratification was made once, and there was no evidence that it was repeated and persistent. In my judgement, a shorter term of imprisonment of about one week would suffice on the facts of the present case.

#### (d)   Sentencing considerations and precedents for CMCA Charge

50     The prescribed punishment for an offence (a first offence) under s 3(1) read with s 10(1) CMCA in a fine not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or both.

51     I accepted the submission of parties that a fine would be an adequate punishment. Some relevant precedents highlighted by the prosecution were the following:

52     As to the quantum of the fine, the prosecution sought the maximum fine of $5,000. In my judgment that would have been excessive in light of the precedents. The maximum fine of $5,000 has been imposed in cases where the facts were far more aggravating and the offender faced more charges (such as in _PP v Rajeswaran s/o Jayaram_ (s/n 4) and _PP v Kang Wei Chian_ (s/n 5)).

53     The accomplice, Phua, pleaded guilty to one charge (with two TIC charges) and he was fined $3,000 (in default, 10 days’ imprisonment). I saw no basis to impose on the defendant a fine higher than that amount. Indeed, the culpability of the defendant could be said to be lower than Phua as he was some steps removed from the actual commission of the offence. He also faced only a single charge under the CMCA (with no TIC charges). His fine ought therefore to be lower than Phua. In my judgment, a fine of $2,000 (in default, one week’s imprisonment) would be an appropriate punishment for this offence.

#### (e)   Consecutive sentences

54     I considered it appropriate that two of the sentences be ordered to run consecutively: (a) the RGA Charge involving the higher bet value; and (b) the PCA Charge. In my judgement this would appropriately reflect the overall culpability of the defendant, bearing in mind his relatively young age, while meeting the sentencing objective of deterrence.

#### Sentence imposed

55     Accordingly, the sentences imposed were as follows:

56     The defendant has paid the fine. He is presently on bail pending the appeal.

[^1]: Arguably, a possible exception was the PCA Charge, where the offer of gratification was made by the defendant in February 2016 when he was 20 years old, and communicated by Sim to Phua in July 2016 when the defendant was 21 years old (above, at \[17\]-\[19\]). The defendant was born in March 1995.
