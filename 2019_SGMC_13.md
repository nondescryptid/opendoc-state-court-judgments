### District Judge Olivia Low:

## Introduction

1       The two accused persons, Chia Yun Ling (“Chia”) (B1) and Tay Wee Kiat (“Tay”) (B2) are husband and wife. They claimed trial to 18 charges and 9 charges respectively in relation to their second domestic maid, one Moe Moe Than, a 31 year-old female Myanmar national.

2       On 20 October 2018, prosecution applied to withdraw one charge against Chia - MAC903411-2017 for failure to bear the cost of repatriation. Pursuant to section 128 of the Criminal Procedure Code, Prosecution also invited the court to amend certain charges against both the accused based on the evidence given at trial, namely Chia’s MAC-902886-2014, MAC-902893-2014, MAC-903410-2017 and Tay’s MAC-902866-2014, MAC-902867-2014, MAC-902868-2014, MAC-902871-2014, MAC-902980-2014, MAC-902883-2014.

3       I allowed these amendments and both the accused maintained their intention to claim trial on the altered charges. Upon the application by defence counsel to recall witnesses to give evidence on the altered charges, I allowed two witnesses - Moe Moe Than and Fitriyah to be recalled. Fitriyah returned to give evidence on the amended charges. Moe Moe Than however had already returned to Myanmar and refused to return to Singapore to testify on the amended charges.[^1] As she was out of jurisdiction, no summons could be issued to her to compel her attendance in court.

4       On 12 December 2018, at the close of the prosecution’s case, the defence made a submission of “no case to answer” on certain charges in relation to Tay and Chia. I granted a discharge amounting to an acquittal on Tay’s MAC-902882-2014 – of Tay hitting the victim repeatedly with a metal stick.

5       On 4 March 2019, after considering the submissions of both prosecution and defence, I acquitted Tay on two charges (MAC-902867-2014 and MAC-902883-2014) and convicted him on the remaining 6 charges. I also acquitted Chia on two charges (MAC-902886-2014 and MAC903413-2017) and convicted her on the remaining 15 charges.

6       I sentenced Chia to a total of 47 months’ imprisonment and imposed a fine of $4000 in default two weeks’ imprisonment. Compensation of $6500 was also ordered to be paid by Chia to Moe Moe Than, in default 4 weeks’ imprisonment. A summary of the charges and the respective sentences are set out below:

8       Prosecution has filed appeals in respect of the following:

a.     MA-9056-2019-01 - The acquittal ordered on Tay’s MAC-902867-2014 and MAC-902883-2014; and

b.     MA-9057-2019-01 - The acquittal ordered on Chia’s MAC-902885-2014 and MAC-903413-2017;

c.     MA-9063-2019-01 - The sentences imposed in Tay’s MAC-902870-2014 and MAC-902880-2014.

d.     MA-9064-2019-01 – The sentences imposed in respect of Chia’s MAC-902893-2014, MAC 906743-2017 and MAC-903409-2017;

e.     MA-9064-2019-02 – That no compensation was ordered in Chia’s MAC-903407-2017, MAC-903408-2017 and MAC-903409-2017;

9       Prosecution did not seek a stay of execution of the sentence, fine or compensation. Both the accused persons were granted a deferment of sentence until 27 March 2019 and are currently serving their sentences. The fine imposed and the compensation sums were not paid.

## The Undisputed Facts

10     The two accused Tay and Chia are husband and wife living in a 5-room HDB flat in Yishun. They have three children, Chloe, Jaden and Celeste who were aged 7, 3 and 1 years respectively at the material time in 2012. Fitriyah, an Indonesian domestic worker worked in the Tay household between December 2010 to December 2012. The victim Moe Moe Than worked as a domestic worker in the Tay household from 8 January 2012 to 12 November 2012 and had been employed to help Fitriyah with the household duties and the caring of the three children.

11     Moe Moe Than’s monthly salary was $400 plus $20 as compensation for not having any off-day. It was not in dispute that during the entire period of her employment, her salary had been withheld. Moe Moe Than and Fitriyah slept in the living room in the house. Fitriyah generally took care of the three children whilst Moe Moe Than focused on the household chores like mopping and cleaning. As for cooking, Fitriyah did the cooking in the morning for herself and Moe Moe Than as well as the children’s meals. In terms of laundry, Chia did most of the laundry using the washing machine whilst Moe Moe Than and Fitriyah did their own laundry by hand.

## Summary of the Prosecution’s Case

12     The charges pertain to acts committed against Moe Moe Than during the course of her employment period from 8 January 2012 till the date she was repatriated on 12 November 2012.

13     The incidents came to light when Moe Moe Than sought help from her Myanmar agent, one Zalian Thuam on the day she returned to Yangon on 12 November 2012. Zalian alerted the local maid agency Nation Employment about Moe Moe Than’s situation and followed up with an email attaching Moe Moe Than’s photographs. The matter was referred to the authorities and the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) subsequently arranged for Moe Moe Than to return to Singapore on 11 December 2012.

14     A first information report was then made on 12 December 2012 by an MOM officer Gerkiel Tay to inform that a maid had been severely abused by her employer.[^2]

15     Moe Moe Than was examined at Khoo Teck Puat hospital on 12 December 2012 and was assessed to have the following injuries: (a) Multiple longitudinal healed scars over the left forearm, right wrist, right posterior part of hip and (b) a 2cm healed laceration over the occiput.[^3]

16     PW1 Moe Moe Than testified on the acts committed against her and the circumstances leading up to these incidents. She also gave evidence on the restrictions imposed on her by the accused persons in relation to her daily living and working conditions and how she was repatriated to Myanmar on 12 November 2012.

17     PW11 Fitriyah testified as to specific incidents in the household where she had been present and had witnessed the offences committed against Moe Moe Than by the accused persons, and on the restrictions imposed by the accused persons in relation to Moe Moe Than’s daily living and working conditions.

18     PW10 Dr Alex Galindez testified in relation to the physical examination he had conducted on Moe Moe Than after the police report was lodged.

19     PW5 Gerkiel Tey, PW2 Insp Muhd Syawal Zain, PW4 SSgt Nur Zahidah Sidek and PW3 SSgt Chu Kok Min are officers from the MOM and the police who testified on how they had received information regarding a case of maid abuse and commenced their investigations. They also gave evidence in relation to their scene visit to the accused persons’ house on 12 December 2012.

20     The police and MOM investigation officers PW9 SSSgt Juraimi Saine and PW6 Andrew Tham testified on the investigations into charges against Tay and Chia. PW9 was also recalled to testify on the unsuccessful efforts in procuring the photographer for P41 to P47 and procuring the attendance of Moe Moe Than to give evidence on the altered charges.

21     PW7 Choo Wei Yin and PW8 Nar Saw Hee were from the maid agency Nation Employment and gave evidence on the contractual arrangements between Chia, the maid agency and Moe Moe Than.

## The Defence’s Case

22     The case for the defence is largely one of denial and speculation that Moe Moe Than had colluded with Fitriyah to make false allegations against them because Moe Moe Than had been repatriated before her employment contract had been completed.

23     Defence counsel also submitted that the accused persons were prejudiced by prosecution’s amendment of the charges which widened the time frame for the alleged offences and/or changed the nature of the assault. In particular, the widening of the time frame defeated the notice of alibi which the defence had given to the prosecution.

24     Both the accused elected to give evidence. Chia also called her brother Chia Kok Hwee to give evidence on the repatriation of Moe Moe Than.

## Credibility of the Witnesses

25     I found Fitriyah to be forthcoming in her evidence, and her testimony was coherent and compelling. She was able to recall events that had happened and where she could not recall the same, she was frank in admitting that she could not remember. She was also clear when

26     In respect of Moe Moe Than, whilst she was able to give details of the various incidents of assault and was largely consistent, there were certain areas where her accounts differed in respect from that of Fitriyah. Furthermore, Moe Moe Than’s subsequent refusal to be recalled to give evidence on the amended charges also meant that her evidence had to be more carefully scrutinised as the defence would otherwise be prejudiced if they did not have a chance to fully cross-examine Moe Moe Than on the facts and circumstances relating to the amended charges.

27     Moe Moe Than also gave evidence on other incidents that had happened, for example, the canister incident. However, as the incident was not the subject matter of the charges before me, I will not deal with it in my judgment.

28     For the accused persons, I found that Tay’s evidence contained external and internal inconsistencies. For example, he could not recall if Moe Moe Than or Fitriyah were required to pay for items that they specifically requested for, but when shown P58, his version changed and even then, his evidence was different from that of Chia’s.[^4] He was also not able to offer a clear explanation as to why the agency did not handle Moe Moe Than’s repatriation.[^5]

29     Chia appeared defensive on the stand and her evidence was not externally or internally consistent, especially in respect of the repatriation of Moe Moe Than. She claimed that Nation Employment would charge her a fee for the repatriation, but this was denied by the agent Choo Wei Yin.

## Reasons for Acquittal on Chia’s MAC-902886-2014 and MAC-903413-2017 and on Tay’s MAC-902867-2014 and MAC-902883-2014

30     I will first set out the reasons for my decision to acquit the accused on the abovementioned charges, before dealing with the evidence and my findings on the rest of the charges.

## Chia acquitted on two charges

##### C2A – MAC-902886-2014 – Naked photo incident

31     Chia is alleged to have taken naked photos of Moe Moe Than in the living room because Moe Moe Than did not give Celeste sufficient water, causing Celeste to suffer constipation.[^6] When the family returned home, Chia instructed Moe Moe Than to remove all her clothing and used a red camera to take a photograph of her naked body. Moe Moe Than said that the camera had a flash. Chia then laughed at her and showed the naked photo to Fitriyah who was present at the time.

32     This earlier version of this charge alleged that the incident took place on the night of 22 January 2012, i.e. Chinese New Year Eve. The timeframe was subsequently broadened to cover the entire employment period. Even under cross-examination, Moe Moe Than stood by her version that the incident took place on 22 January 2012.[^7] Moe Moe Than also stood by her version that the camera had a flash because she saw a flash.[^8]

33     Moe Moe Than further alleged that Chia had told her to sleep in the toilet that evening without her clothes. However, Tay returned home and discovered Moe Moe Than in the toilet and asked her to get dressed.

34     Fitriyah could not recall what had caused the naked photo incident but testified that Chia showed these photographs to Fitriyah and commented on Moe Moe Than’s pose in the photographs. Fitriyah also testified that Chia had said to Moe Moe Than words to the effect that: “You want to go home, I will show this photo to the Bangladesh men. If they are interested in you, you sleep with them. You can get money for you to go home.” Moe Moe Than appeared angry on hearing that. Chia then told Moe Moe Than to put her clothes back on.

35     Fitriyah denied that the red Sony handycam produced by Tay and Chia in court was the same camera used to take photographs of Moe Moe Than. Fitriyah also denied that this incident took place early on in Moe Moe Than’s employment, i.e. it could not have occurred in January 2012.

36     Chia denied that this incident happened at all and that all her three children suffered from constipation. There was therefore no reason why she would punish Moe Moe Than in such a manner. Chia also provided camera specifications of the camera model to show that this particular Sony model did not have a flash.[^9] Chia also showed an invoice to prove that the camera was only purchased on 18 March 2012.[^10]

37     I did not find it safe to convict Chia on this charge for the following reasons:

a.     Whilst this incident was alleged to have taken place on 22 January 2012, Chinese New Year’s Eve, in the earlier version of the charge, this was subsequently amended to cover the entire span of Moe Moe Than’s employment. There is uncertainty as to when exactly this incident took place. On the one hand, Moe Moe Than maintained her version that it took place on Chinese New Year’s Eve. On the other hand, Fitriyah said it could not have happened at the beginning of her employment. Chia also testified that she would be at her in-law’s place to celebrate Chinese New Year’s Eve and would stay there till late, therefore they would not be at home during the window of 10pm and 12am of 22 January 2012 as alleged in the earlier version of the charge.

b.     There was uncertainty as to which was the red camera used to take Moe Moe Than’s photographs. If I were to accept that it was the red Sony handycam, this was only purchased in March 2012 and would directly contradict Moe Moe Than’s evidence that the incident took place in January 2012. On the contrary, if the red Sony handycam was not the camera used to commit the offence, prosecution did not adduce any evidence as to what other red camera could possibly have been used to commit the offence.

c.     Moe Moe Than’s evidence was that she had seen a flash from the camera. The red Sony handycam specifications which showed that the camera did not come with a flash directly contradicted Moe Moe Than’s evidence that the red camera used was the red Sony handycam. Furthermore, when shown pictures of the red Sony handycam, Fitriyah had denied that it was this camera which was used.

d.     Moe Moe Than’s version of events after this incident was that she was asked to sleep in the toilet. Moe Moe Than did not give evidence that Chia had said anything else to her. In contrast, Fitriyah’s version as that Chia told Moe Moe Than that she would show the photographs to Bangladeshi men and that Moe Moe Than could sleep with them to get money to go back. Fitriyah however did not testify to Moe Moe Than being asked to sleep in the toilet or of Tay discovering Moe Moe Than in the toilet.

e.     The red Sony camera was not seized by the police during the raid. Only the SD card in the red Sony camera was seized. Whilst it is not disputed that there were no naked photographs of Moe Moe Than found in the Sony handycam or the SD card, I found that there remained some gaps in terms of evidence. A forensic analysis of the seized SD card done by prosecution revealed that it was a blank SD card. This directly contradicts what the investigation officers had testified to having witnessed on the day of the raid, that photographs could be viewed from the camera, albeit not the incriminating photographs. Furthermore, the SD card that was seized had a different serial number from that shown on the purchase invoice. The accused’s evidence was that this was the only SD card they had in their possession. If the red Sony camera had been used to take photographs of Moe Moe Than, a forensic analysis of the SD card in the camera would assist the prosecution in showing that there had been incriminating photographs taken, or assist the defence in proving that there were no such incriminating photographs taken. In this case, there was no certainty whether the SD card sent for forensic analysis was even the same card as that which was seized on the day of the raid.

38     Given that there was some reasonable doubt as to whether the elements in the charge had been made out in view of the contradictory evidence of the witnesses, it would only have been fair to the defence if they were given an opportunity to cross-examine Moe Moe Than on the amended charge. However, as Moe Moe Than refused to be recalled to be cross-examined on the amended charge, there was no way the defence would be able to put their case to her on when the incident could have taken place, if not on 22 January 2012.

39     Whilst it was possible that Chia may have taken naked photographs of Moe Moe Than, there remained a reasonable doubt if this incident happened. There was no certainty in the time or date of the incident, the device used to take the photographs, a record of the photographs taken, how the incident happened or what happened thereafter. I was of the view that prosecution had not proven this charge beyond a reasonable doubt and accordingly acquitted the accused on this charge.

##### C18A – MAC-903413-2017 – Failure to pay outstanding salaries

40     Moe Moe Than testified that she never received any salary from Chia even after being repatriated, despite signing an acknowledgement and writing a note against her will to say that she had received $1800 in salary.[^11] Prosecution’s case is that the sum of $1450 was due and owing to Moe Moe Than.[^12] Moe Moe Than testified that Chia did not pay her anything because she had to compensate for damage she had caused to the household.

41     Chia however maintained that she had given cash amounting to $1600 to Moe Moe Than on 11 November 2012 although the document at P49 and P50 were backdated to 6 November 2012. She relied on her DBS ATM transaction record[^13] to show that she had withdrawn $1200 in cash on 9 November in order to pay Moe Moe Than with Tay providing the remaining $600 in order to make up a total of $1800.[^14] Chia further testifies that she realised that the payment schedule was erroneous as it included an overpayment of one month. She therefore deducted $200 as payment of the airfare, and gave $1600 to Moe Moe Than, which still represented an overpayment to Moe Moe Than.

42     Whilst Chia testified that she had repatriated Moe Moe Than on her own without the agency’s assistance in order to avoid any allegations of abuse or ill-treatment, I did not find that this was done in order to avoid paying Moe Moe Than any of the salary that was due to her. I also noted that Moe Moe Than could only cite a couple of instances when she was asked to pay compensation for items she had damaged, such as $500 for scratching the table, and $10 for forgetting to switch off the fan, and an incident when she made a hole in a lamp shade cover. These examples certainly did not add up to $1450 such that her entire salary was offset. Moreover, it appeared that this compensation issue had only arisen because Moe Moe Than had wanted to ask for a transfer. Chia had told her that she could only transfer if she had paid off her 7 months’ salary for agent fees as well as compensated for the items she had damaged.

43     Considering the contemporaneous documents such as the DBS ATM transaction record of $1200 together with the acknowledgment on the payment schedule[^15] that $1800 had been received and the further note[^16] by Moe Moe Than (even if written on Chia’s instructions) that she had received her salary, there was some reasonable doubt raised as to whether Chia had indeed failed to pay Moe Moe Than’s outstanding salary.

## Tay acquitted on two charges

##### C3A – MAC-902867-2014 – Fitriyah’s biscuit incident

44     Tay is alleged to have instructed Fitriyah to hit Moe Moe Than with a metal stick. Moe Moe Than testified that on one occasion, she had taken Fitriyah’s biscuit because she was hungry. Fitriyah saw the biscuit in her T-shirt pocket and so did Chia.[^17] When Tay discovered this, he instructed Fitriyah to use a metal pole to hit Moe Moe Than on her buttocks. Moe Moe Than identified the stick as P25 and even said that the stick used to be straight but after she was hit by it, it became “bent”.[^18]

45     Tay denied this and claimed that there was no segregation of biscuits in the household.[^19] Fitriyah did not recall hitting Moe Moe Than with a metal pole despite repeated questions from defence counsel.[^20] Whilst Fitriyah later clarified that she may have used a cane against Moe Moe Than (which was in any event the subject matter of another charge), she was adamant that no metal stick was used.

46     The earlier version of this charge also alleged that the incident took place on a specific date and time, i.e. 5 June 2012 between 12pm to 1pm. Tay had an alibi[^21] which was his carpark records to prove that he was at work that day, by virtue of his car having been parked in his office’s car park from 0943 hrs to 1745 hrs. Prosecution objected to the admission of the records as alibi evidence on the basis of it being hearsay evidence because no formal witness from Wilson Parking was called to confirm the information given.

47     Even if I had been minded to give some weight to the car park records, the charge was in any event subsequently amended to include the entire period of Moe Moe Than’s employment. I note that the defence was not given the opportunity to cross-examine Moe Moe Than on the same because she refused to be recalled as a witness.

48     I found there was some reasonable doubt whether this incident had occurred given the evidence of Fitriyah and Tay, and especially since Fitriyah, who was allegedly the person who hit Moe Moe Than with the metal stick, testified that she had never hit her with a metal stick, let alone P25. In light of the amendment of the charge to expand the time period the offence was alleged to have occurred, this would raise even more doubt as to the precise incident in which Tay had instructed Fitriyah to hit Moe Moe Than with a metal stick. I therefore acquitted Tay on this charge.

##### C9A – MAC-902883-2014 – Bundle of three canes incident

49     Tay is alleged to have instructed Fitriyah to hit Moe Moe Than with three small canes bundled together in July 2012. The prosecution conceded that Moe Moe Than did not raise any incident where she had been caned by Fitriyah on Tay’s instruction.[^22] Fitriyah however testified that she had been instructed by Tay to cane Moe Moe Than although she was unable to provide concrete details on how such incidents came about, or when these occurred, let alone that it occurred in July 2012 itself.

50     I note that it is not in dispute that there were only two canes seized during the raid. Tay and Chia also testified that they did not have a bundle of three canes in the house.

51     The lack of a third cane found in the house, together with the omission by Moe Moe Than to mention any such caning incident and the lack of evidence to point to any such incident happening in July 2012 which could have led to such a caning, raises reasonable doubt whether this incident occurred. I was of the view that prosecution had not proven the charge beyond reasonable doubt and I acquitted Tay on this charge.

## Summary of Findings in relation to the other charges

## B1 Chia Yun Ling

52     I found Chia guilty and convicted her on the remaining 15 charges below.

## 4 Slapping incidents – C1-MAC-902885-2014, C3-MAC-902887-2014, C4-MAC-902888-2014, C5-MAC-902889-2014

##### C1 – MAC-902885-2014 – Sleeping while looking after baby incident

53     Moe Moe Than testified that she was instructed to wake up at 5.30am daily and went to bed only after 12.00am. In January 2012, she felt tired and sleepy whilst seated on the floor looking after the baby Celeste and had accidentally dropped the baby on the floor. Jaden informed Chia about the same when she returned home and Chia scolded her and slapped her more than once and she felt pain.

54     Chia denied slapping Moe Moe Than and claimed that Moe Moe Than played with the children on a big play mat so there was no chance for the children to fall and hit their head. She further claimed that her son Jaden could not speak very well and would not be able to report to her of such a situation.

55     I accepted Moe Moe Than’s evidence given that this happened early on in the employment and would therefore have made a strong impression on her. Moe Moe Than was also forthright in explaining why she had been slapped and was able to give details surrounding the incident even though it had occurred a number of years ago.

##### C3 – MAC-902887-2014 – Woke up late incident

56     This incident occurred on 2 July 2012 at 6.30am. Moe Moe Than was however caught for oversleeping by Chia and was slapped more than once.

57     Chia denied the charge and claimed it was Fitriyah who was responsible for waking up More Moe Than and it was not possible for Moe Moe Than to sleep past 6.30am on a regular day, apart from the fact that there was no urgency for her to wake up to do anything.

58     It was not in dispute that 2 July 2012 was a designated school holiday (because Youth Day fell on Sunday 1 July 2012 and the following Monday would be a school holiday) and thus there was no need for the children to wake up early for school. Whilst there may not have been any need for Moe Moe Than to wake up at the same time, this did not mean that Chia permitted Moe Moe Than to sleep late. I found that Chia had slapped Moe Moe Than for oversleeping.

##### C4 – MAC-902888-2014 – Bedsheets not washed incident

##### C5 – MAC-902889-2014 – Overflowing pail incident

59     The next two incidents occurred just before Moe Moe Than was repatriated, on 9 November and on 10 or 11 November 2012. Moe Moe Than was instructed to wash bedsheets on 9 November but did not do so as it was raining that day. Chia accused her of making excuses and therefore slapped her more than once. When she forgot to turn the tap off when filling water in a pail, Chia scolded Moe Moe Than and slapped her more than once.

60     Chia denied that these two incidents happened. 9 November was a Friday and whilst she could not remember if she was working, she anticipated that the prosecution’s case would be that it would not take long for someone to be slapped. When shown the DBS ATM transaction record to show that she had withdrawn $1200 on 9 November at 12.30pm at Northpoint, Chia explained that she was probably either on her way to or from work. For 10 and 11 November, this was the weekend and Chia said that at the 3pm to 4pm period when the incident was alleged to have occurred, the family would usually be out in the shopping mall or at their in-law’s place. Further Chia said that she had paid Moe Moe Than her salary on 11 November thus she did not think there was any reason to fly into a rage over such an incident.

61     I was of the view that none of what Chia offered was sufficient to raise reasonable doubt that the incidents had happened. The fact that Chia had withdrawn money[^23] in close proximity to her home only a few hours prior to the incident on 9 November meant that Moe Moe Than’s version was preferred. As for the weekend of 10 to 11 November, the evidence was that Tay had left for overseas, thus this made it unlikely that Chia would maintain her routine of going to the mall or visiting her in-laws.

## Two caning incidents – C7A-MAC-902893-2014, C8-MAC-902894-2014

##### C7A – MAC-902893-2014 – Massage incident

62     Moe Moe Than testified that she had to massage Chia’s foot every night in bed until Chia was satisfied and this would usually last till midnight. Fitriyah would be in the same room feeding the youngest child Celeste. As Moe Moe Than sat on the floor to massage Chia’s foot, she felt sleepy and dozed off. Chia saw this and took the cane near her pillow to cane Moe Moe Than on her head, causing her head to swell, saying “You sleepy? You must continue massaging.”

63     Fitriyah’s version was that the foot massages did not take place every night and she may not have been aware of the massages as she would often be taking care of Jaden in the living room. She however witnessed the incident where Chia had caned Moe Moe Than on her head.

64     Chia denied this happened and claimed that it was Moe Moe Than who had volunteered to massage for her on 5 to 6 occasions as she did not want to be seen “doing nothing” whilst Fitriyah was busy. Chia further claimed that this was because Moe Moe Than was aware that Chia would often go to Northpoint in the evenings for foot massages. Chia admitted that it was common for Moe Moe Than to doze off when doing foot massages or when feeding Celeste but Chia said that she would merely move her leg in order to wake Moe Moe Than up. Chia also denied that the cane was kept on her bed, saying that it was hung on up on the fan and it would not be possible for her to wake up to retrieve the cane to hit Moe Moe Than.

65     Whilst the foot massages may not have taken place without fail every night, I found that these occurred on a frequent basis as per Fitriyah’s version. I was satisfied that Moe Moe Than had been caned by Chia during one occasion of foot massage.

##### C8 – MAC-902894-2014 – Dust incident

66     Moe Moe Than testified that Chia found that some plastic boxes in the study room was dusty. Chia got a cane, locked the door and ordered Moe Moe Than to remove her shorts and panties before caning her on her buttocks on bare skin.

67     Chia denied this happened and claimed that the boxes contained prayer items belonging to Tay and it was Tay and Fitriyah who would be responsible for the maintenance of that room and the boxes. Tay admitted that these were his items and that Fitriyah was told not to touch them. He also added that Moe Moe Than was never tasked to clean items in the study room.

68     Given her recollection on the details surrounding the incident, I did not find any reason to disbelieve Moe Moe Than’s testimony that she had been caned.

## Other incidents

##### C6 – MAC-902890-2014 – Mirror incident

69     This incident is alleged to have taken place on 10 June 2012 between 11am to 12pm. The children were playing with toys and one of the toy had a small mirror. Chia caught Moe Moe Than looking at herself in the mirror and came to drag her by her hair to the master bedroom, pushed her to the floor, stepped on her chest and used her hand to rub Moe Moe Than’s cheek. Moe Moe Than had difficulty breathing because Chia stepped on her chest for quite some time.

70     Chia denied this could have happened without Tay or anyone else witnessing it. Also, Chia testified that 10 June 2012 was a Sunday, which would mean that the family already be out of the house by that time. Chia also took issue with the fact that Moe Moe Than was unable to describe the toy that had a mirror given that the assault was significant.

71     Whilst Moe Moe Than was unable to describe the toy, nor was any such toy seized during the raid, I found that Moe Moe Than had provided enough details surrounding the incident. Chia’s testimony did not raise a reasonable doubt as to whether this incident could have happened.

##### C9 – MAC-905414-2017 – Forcing victim’s mouth open

##### C10 – MAC-906743-2017 – Instructing victim to eat her own vomit

##### C12A – MAC-903407-2017 – Forcing victim to eat rice mixed with fine sugar (EFMA charge)

72     Moe Moe Than complained to Chia that she did not have enough to eat. As a result, Chia punished her by squashing her cheek and placing a funnel into her mouth. Chia then pushed a mixture of rice and sugar into Moe Moe Than’s mouth using the funnel. Moe Moe Than was unable to swallow the mixture and choked and ran to the toilet to vomit. Chia followed her in, scolded her and slapped her and instructed her to vomit inside a plastic bag and then eat her own vomit. Moe Moe Than complied. Moe Moe Than also said that Chia had force fed her rice and sugar using a spoon in the same incident.

73     Moe Moe Than’s version is largely corroborated by Fitriyah who witnessed Chia doing the same to Moe Moe Than. Whilst Moe Moe Than and Fitriyah evidence differed as to the colour of the funnel, they were both consistent in describing the shape of the funnel. Fitriyah however said that Moe Moe Than had spat out the rice rather than vomited it out. Fitriyah also said that the incident took place in the toilet and Moe Moe Than was in a lying-down position.

74     Chia denied that this incident took place and even conducted an experiment on video[^24] to show how it was not possible for a mixture of rice and sugar to be forced down a funnel into Moe Moe Than’s mouth. Chia however admitted to seeing a funnel in the house, even though this funnel was not seized during the raid. Chia also gave evidence that Moe Moe Than claimed that the rice in Singapore was not the same as that in Myanmar and she would eat 8 cups of rice in Myanmar. Chia therefore asked Fitriyah to experiment cooking 8 cups of rice which Moe Moe Than could not finish and this was gradually reduced to 2 ½ cups for Moe Moe Than.

75     Notwithstanding the minor inconsistencies between both Moe Moe Than and Fitriyah’s evidence, I was satisfied that the three charges had been proven. Moe Moe Than had been forced to eat the rice sugar mixture and her mouth had been forced open in order for a funnel to be inserted. Thereafter, whether she had spat or vomited the contents out, she was told to then eat what she had spat out. Chia’s experiment was of little evidential value as the ratio of rice, sugar and water may not be identical as that of the alleged incident, nor would the diameter of the spout be the same.

## The EFMA Charges

76     The Employment of Foreign Manpower (Work Passes) Regulations requires that the work permit of a domestic worker be subject to the conditions set out in Part I of the First Schedule. An employer who contravenes any condition of the work pass is guilty of an offence under section 22(1)(a)(i) EFMA. Paragraph 10 and 11 of the conditions in Part 1 of the First Schedule states:

10.    The employer shall not ill-treat the foreign employee, and shall not cause or knowingly permit the foreign employee to be ill-treated by any other person. A foreign employee is ill-treated if —

(_a_)    the foreign employee is subjected to physical or sexual abuse, or to criminal intimidation;

(_b_)    the employer or other person does, or causes the foreign employee to do, any act which causes or is likely to cause injury to the health or safety of the foreign employee; (_c_) the employer or other person neglects or abandons the foreign employee in circumstances which cause or are likely to cause injury to the health or safety of the foreign employee; or

(_d_)    the employer or other person commits an act detrimental to the welfare of the foreign employee.

11.    The employer of the foreign employee shall grant the foreign employee —

(_a_)    adequate rest daily; and

(_b_)    rest day(_s_) in accordance with the terms of the employment contract between them.

##### C11A – Failure to provide adequate food

77     Tay and Chia did not take their meals at home and it was left to Fitriyah to cook meals for Moe Moe Than and herself as well as for the children. Moe Moe Than testified that she initially had rice and cabbage to eat for meals but subsequently she only had plain rice and plain water. She claimed that she was hungry enough to even eat leftover banana skin from the dustbin.

78     Fitriyah corroborated Moe Moe Than’s version that food was restricted and that they had plain bread for breakfast, plain rice with cabbage for the other meals. Fitriyah confirmed that Moe Moe Than was subsequently only given white rice, and the rice was sometimes also mixed with sugar.

79     Chia disputed this and claimed that Moe Moe Than in fact loved eating pork. When her mother-in-law cooked pork dishes she would bring it back for Moe Moe Than to eat every now and then, but not for Fitriyah because she was a Muslim. Chia also said that Fitriyah never alleged during the earlier trial that she had a lack of food. Chia testified that Moe Moe Than would eat rice mixed with sugar because she ate brown rice with sugar in Myanmar. However, Chia discouraged Moe Moe Than from doing so because too much sugar was unhealthy.

80     It is the employer’s responsibility to provide adequate food to the domestic worker and for Moe Moe Than, Chia could not depend on Tay’s parents to cook meat dishes in order to bring back leftovers for Moe Moe Than whilst failing to ensure that her diet on other days was adequate. I did not find that a diet of plain bread, rice, cabbage or sugar to be adequate food in this case. Further, Dr Alex had compared the photographs of Moe Moe Than taken in Myanmar versus that on 12 December 2012 and testified that Moe Moe Than looked undernourished then because he observed an obvious decrease in body fat in Moe Moe Than’s photographs.

##### C13A – MAC-903408-2017 – Doing chores without blouse

81     Moe Moe Than and Fitriyah both could not recall why Moe Moe Than had been made to clean the house wearing only her bra and short pants for about half the day but were both consistent in their evidence that Moe Moe Than was made to clean the house in that state, until just before Tay returned home. Chia’s version was a bare denial. I did not find any reason to disbelieve the version of Moe Moe Than and Fitriyah.

##### C14A – MAC-903409-2017 –Threatening to kill family in Myanmar

82     Chia is accused of orally threatening to kill Moe Moe Than’s family in Myanmar if she told others about how she had been ill-treated and abused in the household, causing Moe Moe Than to feel sad as she felt that the accused persons had money and could do whatever they wanted. Moe Moe Than also claimed that this threat was uttered when she requested for a transfer and Chia told her that she had to compensate for a number of things and if she did not repay them back, Chia would hire an assassin to kill her parents. Chia’s defence was a bare denial that this was uttered.

83     I preferred Moe Moe Than’s version of events and was satisfied that it had taken place within the time period as stated in the charge. As such, I find Chia guilty on this charge.

##### C15B – MAC-903410-2017 – Toilet restriction

84     Moe Moe Than testified that her use of the toilet was restricted to thrice a day so as not to waste water. She would be punished if she used it more than thrice, such as to “jump like a rabbit”. Moe Moe Than believed that Chia was able to keep tabs on her toilet usage because of the various CCTVs installed in the house, and testified that Chia had once called her about her use of a toilet for a fourth time.

85     Fitriyah corroborated Moe Moe Than’s version and said that the accused had also asked her to ensure that Moe Moe Than did not use the toilet more than thrice.

86     Whilst Chia denied doing so and said that it was not possible for her to spend time to monitor Moe Moe Than’s actions all day long via the webcam, this did not mean that Chia did not impose the toilet restriction on Moe Moe Than in order to extend her psychological and physical control over Moe Moe Than. I preferred Moe Moe Than’s and Fitriyah’s version of the events.

##### C17A – MAC903412 – Failure to grant adequate rest

87     Moe Moe Than’s waking hours were 5.30am and she would only sleep past 12 midnight after Chia’s foot massages. As a result, she felt sleepy and tired.

88     Chia on the other hand claimed that Moe Moe Than would sleep around 10.30pm and wake at 5.30am and had the opportunity to nap in the afternoons when the children took their naps. Chia also said that the household chores in the home were not that heavy given that there were two domestic workers in the house with minimal cooking required. Chia even had to do the family’s laundry on her own.

89     I preferred the evidence of Moe Moe Than and Fitriyah. There was no doubt that Moe Moe Than woke up very early in the morning and slept late at night. Whether or not she took naps in the afternoon, the fact was that Chia, by her own admission, said that Moe Moe Than often dozed off during the massages, which indicated her lack of sleep. Moreover, apart from the length of rest, the sleeping conditions of Moe Moe Than were less than ideal. She was made to sleep in the living room, which would mean that she was not able to sleep until the lights were all out, and had no pillow or blanket in order to have a comfortable rest.

## B2 Tay Wee Kiat

90     I found Tay guilty and convicted him on the six charges below.

##### C1 – MAC902865-2014 – Dining table incident

91     Moe Moe Than lifted the glass off the dining table in order to clean it and had caused a small chip at the edge. As a result, Tay punished her by caning her hand and buttocks.

92     Tay admitted that there was an incident when Moe Moe Than had caused a scratch on the table, but Tay said that he was angry because it was dangerous for her to clean it unaided. He brought her down to the agency for counselling. Saw Hee, an employee from Nation Employment denied that Tay had brought Moe Moe Than down. I preferred the evidence of Moe Moe Than.

##### C2 – MAC-902866-2014 – Woke up late incident

93     Moe Moe Than testified that Tay had hit her on her buttocks using a broomstick and a metal clothing hook when she woke up late until the instruments were chipped and bent.

94     Tay denied this and did not think that waking up late was so severe an offence that would require him to assault Moe Moe Than in such a manner. Tay also sought to explain how the dents were not caused by hitting Moe Moe Than but by other reasons such as Moe Moe Than and Fitriyah using these instruments to hang their laundry on the bamboo pole holder.

95     Whilst I agree that it was unlikely that the chip and dent in the broomstick and clothing stick were caused by hitting someone, the charge as framed only required that it be proven that the instruments were used to hit Moe Moe Than on her buttocks. I was satisfied that based on Moe Moe Than’s evidence, this charge had been proven.

##### C4A – MAC-902868-2014 – Chloe refused to study

##### C5 – MAC-902870 -2014– Push-up incident

96     Moe Moe Than testified that Chloe had once refused to study and Tay punished both Moe Moe Than and Fitriyah for the same by caning them on their heads with a cane.

97     Moe Moe Than also said that there was an incident when Tay was angry with Moe Moe Than and Fitriyah over a school paper belonging to Chloe and had instructed both of them to bend in a “push-up” position in the living room before kicking them. The charge as framed alleged that the incident took place between 1 to 5 September at about 2pm to 3pm.

98     Fitriyah’s version was that these two events happened at the same time. Tay had hit them with a cane on the head before asking them to assume the push-up position to kick them.

99     Tay relied on travel and parking records to show that he was not at home on some of the days between 1 to 5 September, although he conceded that his alibi would not cover all the days in that period.

100    Whilst I accepted that Tay may not have been in Singapore or at home on some of those days during that period, it did not mean that the incident could not have occurred at all. Given the consistency of both Moe Moe Than’s and Fitriyah’s evidence on the incident and how it had occurred, I was satisfied that the charge had been proven.

##### C6A – MAC-902871-2014 – Mopping incident

101    The charge alleges that this incident happened on 9 October 2012 at 11pm. Tay found that Moe Moe Than had been cleaning the bedroom too slowly and had pulled her out of the bedroom before pushing her and causing her to hit her shoulder and head on the wall. She felt pain and dizziness as a result.

102    Tay denied this happened as he would never be alone in a room with a domestic worker, and also had a heart condition which prevented him from over-exerting himself.

103    Whilst this charge had been amended and Moe Moe Than was not recalled, I was of the view that defence had cross-examined Moe Moe Than thoroughly on the exact mechanics of the assault and would not have been prejudiced by not being to recall her as a witness. In any event, I preferred Moe Moe Than’s evidence over that of Tay and find Tay guilty on this charge.

##### C7A – MAC-902880-2014 – Prayer incident

104    Moe Moe Than testified that Tay claimed that the domestic workers had moved a small cloth on the Buddhist altar table without his permission. Moe Moe Than and Fitriyah were then instructed to slap each other ten times and to worship in front of the said altar table 100 times despite the fact that Moe Moe Than was a Christian and Fitriyah was a Muslim.

105    Fitriyah also corroborated Moe Moe Than’s version of events, of being accused of opening the cloth covering the altar and being made to worship the altar 100 times. Fitriyah however was unable to recall if Tay had asked them to slap each other ten times. Fitriyah testified that they had been caned on the buttocks in relation to the incident.

106    Moe Moe Than also cited another incident where they were made to slap each other ten times. This was in relation to the baby pacifier incident belonging to Celeste. Fitriyah confirmed there was such an incident where they were made to slap each other, although her recollection was that it was a pacifier belonging to Jaden. Tay had scolded them both to ask what was the point of having two maids if they could not locate the pacifier and then asked them to slap each other.

107    Tay denied that that the prayer and pacifier incident ever took place. He said that there was no taboo for anyone in the family to touch the altar. Tay also did not find that the pacifiers of his children would go missing easily as they would usually be clipped to them.

108    Given the similarity of both Moe Moe Than’s and Fitriyah’s evidence on the two incidents, albeit with slight inconsistencies in certain details, I preferred the evidence of both the domestic workers than compared to Tay. It may well have been possible that Tay had asked them to slap each other on more than one occasion but I was satisfied that this charge had been proved.

## Sentencing

## Mitigation Plea

109    In terms of Tay’s and Chia’s mitigation pleas, I found economic hardship, health issues and caretaking difficulties was of little mitigating value. There was no evidence of remorse shown by the accused given that the two domestic workers were not spared the ordeal of testifying in a full trial.

## Sentencing Considerations

110    In arriving at my decision on sentencing, I was guided by the sentencing framework set out by the High Court in _Tay Wee Kiat & Anor v PP_ (“_Tay Wee Kiat v PP_” as well as the sentences meted out in that case. I have accordingly set out in the table below of where Tay’s and Chia’s section 323 offences fall within the framework in _Tay Wee Kiat v PP_:

## Against Chia Yun Ling

111    I will focus on the sentences that are the subject of prosecution’s appeal first before dealing with the other sentences.

##### C7A - MAC-902893-2014

112    Chia had caned the victim on the head when she fell asleep whilst massaging Chia’s feet. Prosecution sought 6 months’ imprisonment. In _Tay Wee Kiat v PP_, I note that Tay was sentenced to 4 months’ imprisonment for caning Fitriyah on the head with a bundle of three canes. I found Chia’s act to fall in the category of less serious physical and psychological harm and given the similar assault and body part that was assaulted (i.e. caning on the head) the imposition of a similar sentence of 4 months’ imprisonment was appropriate. Furthermore, in Chia’s case, only a single cane was used whereas in Tay’s case, a bundle of three canes were used, which would have inflicted greater pain on the victim.

##### C10 – MAC-906743-2017

113    Chia had instructed the victim to eat her own vomit. The Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act offence has a prescribed punishment of a fine of up to $5,000. I did not find the phrase uttered to be so abusive that a maximum fine of $5,000 as submitted by prosecution was warranted. Moreover, this took place in a private place as opposed to a public place. I nevertheless accepted that in the context of the force-feeding act that occurred just prior to the words being uttered, this would have undoubtedly caused some distress to the victim who had felt she had no choice but to do as ordered by Chia. I therefore imposed a fine of $4000 in default 2 weeks’ imprisonment for this charge.

##### C14A - MAC-902893-2014

114    Chia had threatened Moe Moe Than that she would hire a killer to kill the victim’s parents in Myanmar. Prosecution sought for an imprisonment term of four months for this charge.

115    Amendments to the EFMA was made on 9 November 2012 to enhance the prescribed punishment for a breach of section 22(1)(a) EFMA. As the period during which the offence was committed was just before the EFMA amendments took effect, Chia faced a maximum sentence of a fine of up to $5,000 or an imprisonment term of up to 6 months or both for each EFMA charge.

116    The threat uttered by Chia would amount to ill-treatment under the EFMA Regulations[^25] as it amounted to criminal intimidation, and hence a breach of the conditions to be complied by the employer. Moe Moe Than had testified that she felt sad upon hearing this. I agreed that the custodial threshold had been crossed such that an imprisonment term was warranted, but I did not agree with prosecution’s submission to impose a sentence of four months’ imprisonment. Under the EFMA, I was of the view that such a verbal threat should not attract a higher sentence than an offence where actual harm was caused, for example in C12A MAC903407-2017 (forcing victim to eat rice mixed with sugar), and therefore imposed a sentence of one month’s imprisonment. I would further add that Prosecution retains a discretion to prefer a more serious charge such as criminal intimidation under the Penal Code against the accused for uttering such a threat if a stiffer sentence is sought.

##### The remaining sentences for Chia

117    In relation to the 4 slapping incidents by Chia (MAC-902885-2014, MAC-902887-2014, MAC-902888-2014 and MAC-902889-2014), these all fell within the less serious physical and psychological harm category. Whilst the indicative range is 3 to 6 months, I was guided by the decision in _Tay Wee Kiat v PP_ not to increase the imposed sentence of 2 months’ imprisonment where Chia was convicted of slapping Fitriyah in MAC-902891-2014. Accordingly, I imposed a sentence of 2 months’ imprisonment for each charge.

118    For C6 MAC-902890-2014, Chia had pulled the victim’s hair, dragged her into the bedroom and pushed her to the floor and stepped on her chest. This sequence of actions would fall in the category of mid-range physical harm and more serious psychological harm. A sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment was appropriate.

119    For C8 MAC-902894-2014, Chia instructed the victim to remove her shorts and panties before caning her on her bare buttocks. This fell in the category of mid-range physical harm and more serious psychological harm, given the humiliating mode of punishment. I agreed with prosecution’s submission of a sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment.

120    For C9 MAC-905414-2017, Chia had gripped the victim’s mouth and chin to force her mouth open and placed a funnel into the victim’s mouth to feed her a mixture of rice and sugar and water. This falls in the category of low physical harm but more serious psychological harm. I agreed that 12 months’ imprisonment was appropriate when contrasted with Tay’s sentence of 10 months in MAC-902872-2014 in _Tay Wee Kiat v PP_. There, Tay had forced Fitriyah to stand on a stool and pushed a plastic bottle into Fitriyah’s mouth. Chia’s act here is one where there was a higher degree of psychological harm because of the fear Moe Moe Than would have felt when being force-fed the mixture against her will.

121    For C11A MAC903406-2017, the victim was deprived of adequate food, and was given rice and cabbage at the start of her employment and subsequently just plain rice and water. No compensation was offered to the victim. In line with the precedent cited in _PP v Lim Choon Hong_ , I imposed a sentence of three months’ imprisonment.

122    For C12A MAC-903407-2017, Chia had forced the victim to eat rice with sugar on two occasions, once with a funnel and once with a spoon. This constituted ill-treatment by physical abuse and I imposed a sentence of one month’s imprisonment.

123    For C13A MAC-903408-2017, Chia forced the victim to remove her blouse and clean the house for half a day wearing only her bra and short pants. Whilst there was no physical abuse, this constituted ill-treatment by humiliation without having regard to the victim’s welfare, and I impose a sentence of one month’s imprisonment.

124    For C15B MAC-903410-2017, Chia had restricted the victim’s use of the toilet to three times a day and had enforced this rule by monitoring the victim’s movements in the house on CCTV and asking Fitriyah to check on the victim. I found that this was clearly detrimental to the victim’s health and welfare, and constituted ill-treatment which was a breach of the work pass conditions. The fact that the victim had been punished when she used the toilet for a fourth time in a day meant that this was not merely a verbal threat by Chia. The deprivation of a basic human right to manage one’s bodily functions strikes at the core of one’s dignity. I agreed with prosecution that this act was egregious enough for the maximum six months’ imprisonment to be imposed.

125    For C17A MAC-903412-2017, Chia had deprived the victim of adequate rest. The victim slept only past midnight and had to wake up at 5.30am daily and felt sleepy during the day. Moreover, her rest place was also less than ideal given that she slept in the living room on a mattress but without a pillow or blanket. I agreed that three months’ imprisonment be imposed on this charge.

126    Under the law, where there are three or more sentences, at least 2 of the sentences must run consecutively. Prosecution submitted that five of the 15 sentences should run consecutively – Charges C1 MAC-902885-2014, C6 – MAC-902890-2014, C8 MAC-902894-2014, C9 MAC-905414-2017 and C15B MAC-903410-2017.

127    It must be borne in mind that these were distinct offences even if they pertained to the same victim. The systematic pattern of violence and psychological abuse inflicted on the victim required that the aggregate sentence reflect the culpability of Chia and the harm caused to the victim. Considering the one-transaction rule and the totality principle, I agreed with prosecution’s submissions on the sentences which were to run consecutively, and sentenced Chia to a total of 47 months’ imprisonment and a fine of $4,000[^26] in default two weeks’ imprisonment. Chia’s sentence was not wholly disproportionate nor could it be said to be crushing.

## Against Tay Wee Kiat

128    I will focus on the sentences that are the subject of prosecution’s appeal first before dealing with the other sentences.

129    For C5 MAC902870-2014, Tay had kicked the victim near her left hip and waist whilst she was in a push-up position. Tay was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment in Fitriyah’s case of MAC902876-2014. Prosecution had sought an uplift to 16 months’ imprisonment because of Tay’s lack of remorse. Whilst the lack of remorse is an aggravating factor in sentencing, I did not think such a large uplift was justified in this case. I therefore imposed a sentence of 14 months’ imprisonment.

130    For C1 MAC-902865-2014, Tay had caned the victim on her palm and buttocks after she caused a chip on the table edge. I agreed that this fell in the category of less serious physical harm and mid-range psychological harm and therefore imposed an imprisonment term of 6 months.

131    For C2A MAC-902866-2014, Tay had used a broomstick and a metal clothing hook to hit the victim. The use of two instruments of punishment means that this is in the category of mid-range physical harm and mid-range psychological harm. I agree that eight months’ imprisonment is appropriate.

132    For C4A MAC-902868-2014, Tay had caned the victim on her head. I agreed that this was identical to the incident in MAC902874-2014 of _Tay Wee Kiat v PP_ where Tay also caned Fitriyah on the head and was sentenced to 4 months’ imprisonment. Accordingly, I also imposed four months’ imprisonment here.

133    For C6A MAC902871-2014, Tay had pulled the victim out of a bedroom and thrown her against a wall causing the victim to hit her head and shoulder on the wall. I agreed that the severity of this act was similar to that in Fitriyah’s case where Tay had pulled Fitriyah by the hair, grabbed her chin and pushed her head against a cabinet and was sentenced to 10 months’ imprisonment in MAC902877-2014. Here, I similarly impose an imprisonment term of 10 months.

134    Prosecution sought for three of the six sentences to run consecutively giving a total imprisonment term of 38 months. However, I did not agree with prosecution’s submission to run C5 MAC-902870-2014 and C7A MAC 902880-2014 consecutively. This was because the acts against Moe Moe Than and Fitriyah for these two incidents were effectively one transaction as they occurred at the same time. In C5 MAC-902870-2014, both of them were punished over the same incident and were kneeling in the push-up position at the same date, time and place and Tay kicked them one after the other. In C7A MAC 902880-2014, Tay’s one instruction for Moe Moe Than and Fitriyah to slap each other 10 times resulted in two separate charges for the abetment of each person to slap the other.

135    To order that these two sentences to run consecutively would mean that Tay would possibly serve a sentence of 14 months’ for Fitriyah slapping Moe Moe Than plus another 12 months’ imprisonment for Moe Moe Than slapping Fitriyah when he simply gave one set of instructions to two persons to slap each other. This is in the event that the High Court in _Tay Wee Kiat v PP_ orders that the sentences imposed there commence only upon the expiry of their current sentences in this trial.

136    This stands in stark contrast to the charges where Chia was sentenced to just 2 months’ for actually slapping the victim. Had Tay been tried in a single trial for C5 MAC 902870-2014 and C7A MAC 902880-2014 with MAC902876-2014 and MAC902881-2014 in _Tay Wee Kiat v PP_, it would have been highly unlikely a judge would have ordered that the sentence for C5 MAC 902870-2014 was to run consecutively with MAC 902876-2014 in _Tay Wee Kiat v PP_ and the sentence for C7A MAC 902880-2014 was to run consecutively with MAC 902881-2014 because of the one transaction principle. I further note that the sentences for MAC 902876-2014 and MAC 902881-2014 in _Tay Wee Kiat v PP_ have already been ordered to run consecutively.

137    I therefore ordered that the sentences for C1 MAC 902865-2014, C2A MAC 902866-2014 and C6A MAC 902871-2014 be ordered to run consecutively, giving a total 24 months’ imprisonment. I accept that this was not the usual order where the longest sentence would also be one of the sentences that run consecutively with the other sentences, however as explained in the preceding paragraph above, to order that either or both of the longest sentences of 14 months’ each run consecutively in this case would effectively amount to punishing Tay twice over, especially if the global sentences in _Tay Wee Kiat v PP_ are ordered to commence upon the expiry of this sentence. In light of Tay’s earlier sentence of 43 months in _Tay Wee Kiat v PP_, I am of the view that a further 24 months’ imprisonment for Moe Moe Than’s case will not be a crushing sentence.

## Commencement of Sentences

138    Whilst both Tay and Chia had already been sentenced in _Tay Wee Kiat v PP_, at the point of sentencing on 18 March 2019, they were not _currently undergoing imprisonment_. As such, section 322 of the Criminal Procedure Code (“CPC”) does not apply. Whilst I was of the view that the two sentences in this trial for Tay and Chia of 47 months and 24 months respectively should run consecutively to the sentences in _Tay Wee Kiat v PP_, it was not possible for me to rely on section 322 CPC to order that their sentence commence upon the expiry of the earlier sentence in _Tay Wee Kiat v PP_ because they had not started serving their earlier sentence and section 322 CPC would not be applicable.

139    Prosecution and defence counsel also agreed that the sentences I had imposed should commence first, whilst the High Court in _Tay Wee Kiat v PP_ would decide on later date on the commencement date of the other set of sentences imposed in that case.

## Compensation

140    I heard parties’ respective submissions on compensation pursuant to section 359 CPC. Prosecution sought that compensation of $9000 be ordered to be paid by Chia to Moe Moe Than for her pain and suffering, being $1000 for MAC 902894-2014 as this was an incident of caning on bare skin, and a sum of $500 per charge for all the remaining charges. Prosecution submitted that a sum of $3000 be ordered to to be paid by Tay to Moe Moe Than for her pain and suffering.

141    In line with the principles espoused in _Tay Wee Kiat and another v Public Prosecution_ which dealt with the issue of compensation, I agreed that a rough-and-ready approach be taken and compensation be ordered in clear cases. I note that there was no victim impact statement here, however I was of the view that compensation was appropriate for charges where there was tangible harm caused to the victim.

142    For Tay, I ordered compensation of $500 to be paid on each of the six charges, amounting to a total compensation of $3000 to be paid by Tay, in default two weeks’ imprisonment.

143    For Chia, I ordered that compensation of $1000 be paid to Moe Moe Than for MAC 902894-2012 and a sum of $500 each for 11 other charges, being MAC 902885-2014, MAC 902887-2014, MAC 902887-2014, MAC 902888-2014, MAC 902889-2014, MAC 902890-2014, MAC 902893-2014, MAC 905414-2017, MAC 906743-2017, MAC 903406-2017, and MAC 903410-2017.

144    I declined to order compensation of these three charges C12A MAC 903407-2017, C13A MAC 903408-2017 and C14A MAC 903409-2017for the following reasons:

a.     For C12A MAC 903407-2017, this was in fact part of the same incident as C9 MAC 905414-2017 followed by C10 MAC 906743-2017 and for which compensation of $500 for each of the charge had already been ordered. It was not necessary that the accused be compensated in addition to the two charges.

b.     For C13A MAC 903408-2017, the removal of clothes whilst working may have been embarrassing to Moe Moe Than but I did not find that any physical harm was caused to Moe Moe Than.

c.     For C14A MAC 903409-2017, this was a verbal threat in which I did not find any physical harm caused to Moe Moe Than.

145    I ordered a total compensation of $6500 to be paid by Chia to Moe Moe Than, in default 4 weeks’ imprisonment. Moe Moe Than’s compensation from Tay and Chia will therefore be for a total of $9500.

146    Counsel for the defence applied for a short deferment for Tay and Chia to settle their personal matters before commencing sentence. I acceded to their request and ordered that Tay and Chia surrender on 27 March 2019 to commence serving their sentences. As at the date of my judgment, no appeal has been filed by Tay or Chia.
