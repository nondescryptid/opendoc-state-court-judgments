\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9177/2019/01\]

16 August 2019

### District Judge Edgar Foo:

## Introduction

1       The accused, a 30-year-old Singaporean male, pleaded guilty to 1 charge under section 22(1)(a) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184, 1997 Rev Ed) and 1 charge under section 379 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).

2       2 other charges were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing, namely, 1 charge under section 379 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) and 1 charge under section 21 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184).

3       After considering the Prosecution’s submission on sentence and the Defence’s Mitigation Plea, I imposed the following sentences on the Accused:-

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="14.5938708717644%"> <col width="35.8524248735495%"> <col width="49.5537042546861%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>S/No.</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge No.</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentence</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 922361-2018</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4 weeks’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">MAC 906773-2018</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$2000 fine in default 2 weeks’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Total Sentence:</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4 weeks’ imprisonment and $2,000 fine in default 2 weeks’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

I also ordered that knuckleduster which is the subject matter of DAC 922361-2018 be forfeited to the police for disposal.

4       The Defence being dissatisfied with my decision has filed an appeal against my orders.

## The Charges

5       The proceeded charges read as follows:

**3rd CHARGE (AMENDED) - DAC 922361-2018**

> You … are charged that you, on 20/09/2017, at or about 05.15pm, at Blk 502A Yishun Street 51 Singapore, were found armed with an offensive instrument, to wit, a knuckleduster, without lawful authority or for a lawful purpose, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 22(1)(a) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184, 1997 Rev Ed).

**1st CHARGE (AMENDED) – MAC 906773-2018**

> You… are charged that you on 31 August 2017, at about 11.52 p.m., at Block 506 Yishun Avenue 4 Multi-storey Carpark Singapore, Singapore, did commit theft of a motorcycle handphone mounting bracket valued at S$45.00/-, in the possession of one Wong Wai Kit, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 379 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

## Statement of Facts

6       The accused admitted to the following Statement of Facts without qualification.

## Facts relating to 1st Charge – MAC 906773-2018

7       The victim is Wong Wai Kit, Male. He was 30 years old at the time of the incident.

8       On 1 September 2017, at about 9.36 p.m., the victim lodged an electronic police report informing that, at about 7.45 p.m. on the same day, he realised that the hand-phone mounting bracket that had been affixed to his motorcycle had been stolen.

9       Investigations revealed that on 31 August 2017, sometime before 11.50 p.m., the victim’s motorcycle was parked in a motorcycle lot the multi-storey carpark at Block 506, Yishun Avenue 4, Singapore. A hand-phone mounting bracket which was valued at S$45, was affixed to the victim’s motorcycle’s right mirror then.

10     On the same day, at about 11.50 p.m., the Accused rode his scooter into level 1 of the said carpark. He parked his scooter next to several motorcycles, including the victim’s. He then dismounted from his scooter, and after confirming that there was no one else around, used a tool to tamper with the victim’s motorcycle and remove the hand-phone mounting bracket. The Accused left the carpark on his scooter at about 11.52 pm with the victim’s hand-phone mounting bracket.

11     On 20 September 2017, the victim’s hand-phone mounting bracket was recovered by the police when they went to the Accused’s residence to investigate a separate offence.

12     In the circumstances, the Accused has committed an offence of theft punishable under section 379 of the Penal Code, (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

## Facts relating to 3rd Charge – DAC 922361-2018

13     The victim in MAC 906774-2018 is Liu Haidi, Male. He was 31 years old at the time of the incident. The Accused had admitted to MAC 906774-2018 and had consented to MAC 906774-2018 to be taken into consideration (“TIC”) for the purpose of sentencing.

14     On 19 September 2017, at about 5.53 p.m., the victim lodged a police report at Yishun North Neighbourhood Police Centre, informing that on 13 September 2017, at about 5.15 a.m., he noticed the Accused meddling with his e-bike which was parked at the void deck of Block 504 Yishun Avenue 4, Singapore. He shouted at the Accused and asked him what he was doing. At this juncture, the victim noticed that the e-bike’s batteries were missing and that the e-bike’s wires were cut. He then asked the Accused to open his bag. When the Accused opened his bag, the victim saw that his e-bike batteries were in the Accused’s bag. The Accused then tried to escape on his own e-bike but the victim managed to stop him. The Accused then told the victim that he would pay for the damage to the victim’s e-bike which amounted to about $500 to $700 once he had the money. The victim then the Accused for his name, NRIC No. and contact details. The Accused furnished his mobile phone number but gave a fake name and NRIC No. to the victim. When the Accused did not make any payment to the victim, the victim lodged the said police report.

15     On 20 September 2017, at about 5.15 p.m., police officers went to the Accused’s residence at Block 502A Yishun Street 51, #XXX, Singapore, to investigate the alleged theft. Over the course of investigations, the police discovered a black knuckleduster tied to the handle of the Accused’s e-bike with a piece of plastic. The knuckleduster was easily removable. The Accused admitted to being in possession of the knuckleduster without lawful authority or lawful purpose.

16     In the circumstances, the Accused was found armed with an offensive instrument without lawful authority or lawful purpose and has thereby committed an offence punishable under section 22(1)(a) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184, 1997 Rev Ed).

17     The Accused committed both the above offences while on agency bail. He was arrested for criminal trespass on 1 July 2017. The criminal trespass charge is MAC 906775-2018. The Accused had admitted to MAC 906775-2018 and had consented to MAC 906775-2018 to be TIC for the purposes of sentencing.

## Antecedents

18     The accused is untraced for any previous offence.

## The Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

19     The Prosecution had sought a sentence of 6 weeks’ imprisonment for the section 22(1)(a) Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act charge. As for the section 379 Penal Code charge, the Prosecutor had submitted for a fine and they were leaving the amount of fine to be determined by the Court,

20     With regard to the section 22(1)(a) Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act charge, the Prosecution had tendered a Table of Sentencing Precedents which is annexed hereto and marked “Annex A”. The Prosecution had submitted that based on the sentencing precedents, the usual benchmark for someone who is untraced and who has been arrested for being in possession of a knuckleduster under section 22(1)(a) Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act is about 4 weeks.

21     The Prosecution also highlighted to me that the aggravating factors in the present case included the fact that the Accused faced multiple charges. In the present case, the Accused has 2 other charges which were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing and one of the 2 charges that were taken into consideration also involved a section 379 theft offence.

22     The Prosecution also pointed out that another aggravating factor was the fact that the Accused had committed both the offences which was proceeded upon while he was on police/agency bail for criminal trespass.

23     Given these aggravating factors, the Prosecution was of the view that there should be an uplift in the sentence to be imposed for the section 22(1)(a) Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act charge and the Prosecution had proposed a sentence of 6 weeks’ imprisonment for the section 22(1)(a) Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act charge.

## Mitigation

24     The Defence Counsel Mr Siraj Shaik Aziz had submitted a Written Plea in Mitigation on behalf of the Accused.

25     In his Written Plea in Mitigation, the Defence Counsel had proposed a fine of $1,500 to $2,000 for the section 379 Penal Code charge. As for the section 22(1)(a) Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act charge, the Defence Counsel had requested that I call for a probation report or in the alternative impose a Short Detention Order on the Accused.

26     The Defence also urged me to consider the following mitigating factors[^1]:-

> a.     The Accused, who is untraced, is a Security Supervisor at Parc Vera Condominium. He lives with his wife who has just given birth to a daughter in October 2018 and stays at home to care for the child.

> b.     The Accused is the sole bread winner of the family. He earns $85 a day ($2400 a month) in a daily rated occupation.

> c.     The present charges have created significant anxiety for the Accused who worries about how his family would be supported if he were to be incarcerated particularly given the family’s hand-to-mouth existence predicated on continued employment of the Accused.

> d.     In the period of the theft offences, the Accused was working as a food delivery driver for Deliveroo earning less than $500 a month. He was also the sole breadwinner. With his meagre income, the Accused was struggling to pay his bills and the household expenses. He had outstanding conservancy and utilities charges and a civil suit has been commenced against him for his inability to pay.

> e.     The Accused had committed the thefts in order to sell the items to pay these outstanding bills. Since then, the Accused has taken up a different job which provides significantly more pay and he is starting to settle his debts

> f.     As for the offence involving the knuckleduster, the Accused came into possession of the knuckleduster in 2013 as an ornamental belt buckle on a belt bought for him as a honeymoon gift by his wife at Pratunam Market in Bangkok, Thailand.

> g.     The belt had subsequently worn off over time as the belt anchor to the hole stretched and gave way. The Accused kept the buckle given the sentimental value of the honeymoon gift. The Accused had no intention to use the knuckleduster let alone for nefarious ends. He used the knuckleduster on the e-bike handle to hang items bought from shops.

## The Defence’s Sentencing Submissions

27     The Defence had submitted that a fine of $1,500 to $2,000 is appropriate for the theft charge given the low of the item and its recovery. In support of their submission, the Defence had cited a number of cases involving theft of low value items where fines have been imposed by the Courts.

## Defence is of the view that probation is a suitable sentencing option for the offensive weapon charge

28     The Defence had submitted that the Accused’s age and the seriousness of the offences at hand do not preclude the Accused from probation for the offensive weapon charge.

29     The Defence also referred me to the case of _Public Prosecutor v Lim Chee Yin Jordon_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 46</span> at \[32\], where See Kee Oon J affirmed the following proposition:

> _“...what is also clear is that this does not mean that adult offenders who are above 21 years old can never be sentenced to probation._ **_Still less does it mean that the age of 21 operates as some sort of a bright line beyond which probation can never be granted. Indeed, s 5(1) of the POA imposes no such general prohibition_** _.”_

30     See Kee Onn J also affirmed, at \[33\], the following observation in _Goh Lee Yin v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 1 SLR(R) 530</span> where the High Court held (at \[28\]) as follows:

> _“Evidently, the age of an offender is often indicative of the effectiveness of probation in bringing about rehabilitation. However, this does not lead to the inexorable conclusion that rehabilitation can never be the operative concern in the case of an offender above the age of 21_, **_particularly if he or she demonstrates an extremely strong propensity for reform and/or there are exceptional circumstances warranting the grant of probation_**_. The offender’s age, therefore, is by no means absolutely determinative of the appropriate sentence as the court must still examine the facts in the individual case. …”_

31     The Defence also referred me to the case of _Sim Wen Yi Ernest v Public Prosecutor_ \[2016\] 5 SLR 2073 (“**_Sim Wen Yi_**”) where at \[28\], it was observed that “**_older offenders may in fact be more receptive to probation as they are generally more mature and better able to understand their responsibilities, the consequences of breaching probation, and the significance of being afforded a chance for reform_**.”

32     In the present case, the Defence was of the view that offensive weapons charge was not a serious charge given that the maximum punishment prescribed is 2 years’ imprisonment and the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order & Nuisance) Act addresses minor offences. And even if a finding is made that the offence is a serious one, this will not, _per se_, operate as a bar to probation which has been granted in serious offences where the rehabilitative potential of the offender was assessed to be significant. A calcified and rigid approach in sentencing based on the genus of offences would unnecessarily limit the sentencing options available.

33     The Defence also pointed out that in _Lim Pei Ni Charissa v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 31</span> (“_Charissa_”), the High Court had observed at \[17\]:

> “_While it may be the case that the more egregious the offence or the more recalcitrant the offender, the less likely the offender will be able to convince the court that he or she will reform and respond to rehabilitation_, **_there is nothing in the cases or in the statutes that indicate that the courts must view such circumstances as always ruling out the possibility of probation. In all such cases, the guiding principle is the likely responsiveness of the young offender to rehabilitation._** _The court must apply its mind to the facts of each case and, in particular, the probation report_.” \[Emphasis added\].

34     In _Charissa_, and _Public Prosecutor v Chia Shu Xuan_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGDC 369</span>, probation had been granted to adult offenders for serious charges. In essence, in both cases, they faced a significantly high number of charges (Charissa faced 177 charges and claimed trial to the 7 proceeded charges, while Chia Shu Xuan faced 155 charges, and pleaded guilty to the 9 proceeded charges). The amounts involved rang up to the thousands. The genuses of offences in those cases were also very serious (Charissa had committed credit card fraud, while Shu Xuan had committed computer crimes, as characterized in the judgment).

35     In the present case, the Defence was of the view that the penalties under the offensive weapon charge was intended to address the fights that “_goes on between rival gangs to secure control of particular places or particular rackets_” and to “a_rrest these thugs who have gathered for a gang fight and find them in possession of these vicious weapons_”[^2].

36     The Defence also submitted that the Accused did not fall within usual class of offenders targeted by the offensive weapon charge under Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order & Nuisance) Act :

> a.     The Accused did not have any violent-related antecedents and was not a member of a gang or secret society

> b.     The knuckleduster was the buckle of a belt gifted to the Accused’s wife by his wife and not procured by him

> c.     The Accused had never used, or planned to use, the knuckleduster to inflict violence on anyone or in the commission of any offence

37     The Defence also pointed out that Accused was not prosecuted for the more serious offence under Section 6(1) of the Corrosive and Explosive Substances & Offensive Weapon Act, Chapter 65 which has a similar object to its Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order & Nuisance) Act counterpart.

38     The Defence further submitted that while the Accused’s possession of the offensive weapon was discovered while he was on agency bail, the Accused had come into possession during his honeymoon in 2013; years before he was put on agency bail. Unlike the theft charge, he had not set out to commit this offence while on bail and as such did not demonstrate an active disregard for the law.

39     In light of the above, the Defence was of the view that the ‘’re-offending”, a misnomer, should not be construed as an aggravating factor in this case.

40     The Defence was of the view that while this fact is not a mitigating factor, it should also not be regarded as an aggravating factor.

41     The Defence also submitted that the Accused’s propensity for rehabilitation ought to be explored in a probation report given the following:-

> a.     The Accused has strong family support. The Accused’s family is a stable unit. The Accused shares a good relationship with his wife who is committed to providing supervision over the Accused to ensure his rehabilitation.

> b.     The Accused has shown remorse over his actions. The Accused has taken responsibility for his actions and is remorseful for having committed the offences. The Accused understood that this offence led to severe consequences such as getting into trouble with the law and causing significant trauma to his wife who relies on him to provide for her and their daughter.

> c.     The Accused is committed to a goal-oriented life. The Accused has been constructively engaged in employment and is anchored to proceeding on the straight and narrow path by his desire to care for his both his daughter (as a new father) and his wife and the significant hardship he would place them in should he run afoul of the law again.

42     Given the above factors, the Defence was of the view that the Accused’s prospects for rehabilitation was optimistic. These signs at the very least warrant the call for a probation report to fully assess Accused’s rehabilitative potential. Probation will allow Accused to provide for his family and re-integrate into society without the stigma of a criminal record.

43     In the alternative, in the event that the Court was inclined towards incarceration, the Defence had suggested a Short Detention Order (“SDO”) would be a suitable alternative sentencing option.

## In the alternative, the Defence is submitting that a SDO is a suitable sentencing option

44     The Defence has also submitted that the Accused is not precluded from a SDO because of his age. In the present case, the Accused does not suffer from any form of mental disorder, However, the Defence is of the view that adult offenders with no mental disorder are not precluded from Community Based Sentencing (“CBS”) options. In _Public Prosecutor v Gan Boon Kheng_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 162</span>, a 25-year-old offender who had also committed the offence of voluntarily causing hurt was assessed to be suitable for a combination of an SDO and a CSO. There, the offender punched the victim during an altercation which arose out of a basketball game. In sentencing the offender to a combination of an SDO and a CSO, **the District Judge expressly rejected the prosecution’s submission that CBSs are meant only for young offenders and minor offences of a regulatory nature or for persons with mental disorder**. He reasoned that CBSs also seek to offer offenders the opportunity to move on from their first mistake of committing a crime, one that is not so serious to preclude rehabilitation (at \[18\]). **Further, in his view, the SDO caters to the situation where the court finds that the threshold for imposing a custodial sentence has been crossed due to the nature of the offence, but that at the same time, the offender possesses the necessary characteristics and support for immediate re-integration into society** (at \[22\]). The prosecution’s appeal against sentence was discontinued.

45     The Defence also highlighted that in _Sim Wen Yi_, See Kee Oon JC (as he then was) _Sim Wen Yi_, did comment on _PP v Gan Boon Kheng_ **without disagreeing** on the lower Court’s view of what SDO caters for, and he did opined at \[40\] that:

> _“I did not think that offenders over the age of 21 should ipso facto be denied the opportunity to he considered for CBS._ **_The rehabilitative aim does not automatically recede into the background once the offender reaches 21 years of age_** _. In every crime, the particular circumstances of the offence and the offender in question must be carefully scrutinised and evaluated to determine whether rehabilitation should he given prominence notwithstanding any countervailing need for deterrence, retribution or prevention: Kalairasi at \[39\]. Thus, the appropriateness of CBS is a question which turns on all the relevant circumstances of each case, including the offence and the offender in question.’_

46     The Defence is of the view that the Accused is an individual who possesses the necessary characteristics and support for immediate re-integration into society. A short stint in prison under an SDO will have the twin effect of deterrence and rehabilitation.

47     The Defence is also of the view that a short detention order, although a community-based sentence, will also serve the objectives of retribution and deterrence. As stated in _Sim Wen Yi_ at \[44\]:

> _“_ **_An SDO carries a punitive and deterrent element and this would suitably address the issue of his culpability. The authors of Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts observe that through the principle of the ‘clanging of prison doors’, the SDO acts as a warning for the offender of a more severe experience of imprisonment if he were to reoffend_** _(at p 90). I digress briefly to note that the “clang of the prison gates” principle originated prior to the introduction of CBS and in a slightly different context. The usual basis for the application of the “clang of the prison gates” principle is that the shame of going to prison is sufficient punishment for a person of eminence (Tan Sai Tiang v Public Prosecutor <span class="citation">\[2000\] 1 SLR(R) 33</span> at \[39\]–\[40\]). Given the limited scope that has been ascribed to the principle, it is arguable that it is not conceptually correct to apply the principle in the context of SDOs._ **_I would, however, observe provisionally that the ambit of this principle could potentially be expanded to include SDOs having regard to the wider range of sentencing options currently at the court’s disposal.”_**

48     Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon also affirmed this extension of the ‘clang of the prison gates’ doctrine in his Keynote Address at the 2017 Sentencing Conference. In terms of the signalling effect of a SDO, it was clarified in _Public Prosecutor v Teo Chang Heng_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1163</span> at \[15\] and \[17\], that the a SDO should not be perceived as a soft option as the accused person will be incarcerated pursuant to a SDO and will be deprived of his liberty. Thus, “_the SDO in fact signals that what he did was serious and he is not being let off scot-free_.”

49     The Defence had submitted that a SDO would have a deterrent and punitive effect on the Accused. As the Accused has never been incarcerated and has been very anxious about that prospect, it is submitted that the ‘clang of the prison gates’ is operative here. A SDO would also adequately communicate to him the consequences of re-offending which would result in longer periods of incarceration.

50     The Defence was of the view that a SDO of 14 days would be sufficient to signal to the Accused his wrongdoings.

51     In the present case, I also note that the Defence had, in their Written Plea in Mitigation, submitted for a fine for the theft charge and either a probation or SDO for the offensive weapon charge. However, in their oral submission in court on 29 July 2019, the Defence had instead requested that I call a probation report for all the charges instead of imposing a fine for the theft charge.

## Prosecution’s Reply

52     The Prosecution had objected to both the calling of a probation report as well as the sentence of a SDO for the Accused. The Prosecution was of the view that the both the options are not suitable because of the number of charges preferred against the Accused and the fact that he had re-offended whilst on police bail. The Prosecution was also of the view that the offensive weapon charge is a serious charge as the weapon in question is a knuckleduster and it can cause very serious injuries if it is used in any manner unlawfully.

## My Decision

## Whether I should call for a probation report in this case

53     As reiterated by See Kee Onn J in _PP v Lim Chee Yin Jordan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 1294</span> at \[29\] (“_Lee Chee Yin Jordan_”), rehabilitation had to be shown to be the dominant sentencing principle in order for a probation order to be justified. See J further noted at \[34\] that while there is no general prohibition for adult offenders who are above 21 years old to be sentenced to probation, it is “the exception rather than the norm” for adult offenders to be granted probation. This is because where an offender is an adult offender, i.e. above the age of 21 at both the time of the offence and the time of sentencing, neither the retrospective rationale nor the prospective rationale underlying the presumptive primacy of rehabilitation would apply: _A Karthik v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 1289</span> (“_A Karthik_”) at \[44\].

54     The High Court has also consistently held that rehabilitation would only be regarded as the operative consideration when sentencing adult offenders if the particular offender concerned “_demonstrates an extremely strong propensity for reform and/or there are exceptional circumstances warranting the grant of probation_” (see _Lim Chee Yin Jordan_ at \[33\]; _A Karthik_ at \[34\]).

55     It is also clear from the cases that if an offender is suffering from psychiatric condition or mental disorder which had a causal link to the commissioning of the offences, the court can use that ground as a consideration to call for a probation report.

56     It is also clear that as a general rule, probation is inappropriate for serious offences or where violence has been committed.

57     In the present case, the Accused was charged with 4 distinct offences:- 2 theft charges, 1 offensive weapons charge and 1 charge of wilful trespass.

58     The Defence has submitted that the offensive weapon charge is not a serious offence because it is an offence under the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order & Nuisance) Act. I do not agree with the Defence’s submission on this point. This offence involves a dangerous/offensive weapon ie a knuckleduster. A knuckleduster is a weapon which if used in the wrong way can cause serious injury or even death to a person. I am of the view that the offence by its nature is a serious offence.

59     In the present case, the Accused is not a young offender below the age of 21 years but was more than 28 years old when he committed the 4 offences. While I accept that there is no general prohibition for adult offenders who are above 21 years old to be sentenced to probation, it is clear that considerations on which we call for probation report for youthful offenders and adults are very different. In the present case, given the age of the Accused at the time of commission of the offences, the sentencing framework for young offenders is not applicable to the Accused. For an offender above the age of 21, rehabilitation can be an operative concern only if he or she demonstrates an extremely strong propensity for reform and/or there are exceptional circumstances warranting the grant of probation.

60     I also note that the Accused is not suffering from psychiatric condition or mental disorder which had a causal link to the commissioning of the offences.

61     The Defence had highlighted 3 factors which they say evidence of propensity towards rehabilitation by the Accused:-

> a.     The Accused’s strong family support.

> b.     The Accused’s remorse over his past actions.

> c.     The Accused’s commitment towards a goal-oriented life as shown by his constructive engagement in employment.

62     I am of the view the above factors which are highlighted by the Defence are not exceptional grounds to the extent that rehabilitation should displace deterrence to be the dominant sentencing consideration. The factors raised by the Defence do not raise any exceptional or extenuating circumstances that warrant a departure from the usual sentencing approach. The factors highlighted by the Defence also do not demonstrate any **extremely strong propensity** by the Accused towards reform.

63     I also note that the Accused faced not 1 but 4 charges and the 2 charges which were proceeded upon by the Prosecution were committed by the Accused whilst he was on agency bail and being investigated for another offence. This was admitted by the Accused in his Statement of Facts.

64     Given the above, I am of the view that probation is clearly inappropriate in the present case as the Accused is an adult offender who has not demonstrated any exceptional or extenuating circumstances deserving of a departure from the sentencing norm.

65     The Defence has also referred me to the cases of _Charissa_, and _Public Prosecutor v Chia Shu Xuan_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGDC 369</span>. The Defence has submitted that both these cases involved serious offences and multiple charges but the court had granted probation to both the offenders in the 2 cases. In _Charissa_, the offender faced 177 charges and claimed trial to the 7 proceeded charges, while in _PP v Chia Shu Xuan_, the offender faced 155 charges, and pleaded guilty to the 9 proceeded charges. I note that in both these cases, the offenders were under the age of 21 when they committed the offences. As such the considerations for calling a probation report would be very different in these 2 cases as compared to the present case when the Accused is already a 28 year old adult when he committed his offences. In any event, both the offenders in _Charissa_, and _Public Prosecutor v Chia Shu Xuan_ were under 21 years old and 22 years old when they were dealt with by the courts.

## On whether SDO is a viable sentencing option for the section 22(1)(a) offence

66     Community Based Sentencing which include the SDO was introduced under Part XVII of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Revised Edition). In the parliamentary debates leading to the passing of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 Bill, Mr K Shanmugam, Minister of Law, elaborated on the rationale for community based sentences[^3]:

> “Community Based Sentences gives more flexibility to the Courts. Not every offender should be put to prison. Community Based Sentences targets offences and offenders traditionally viewed by the Courts to be on the rehabilitation end of the spectrum: regulatory offences, offences involving younger accused persons and persons with specific and minor mental conditions…”

67     At the same debate, Member of Parliament Mr Michael Palmer also made the following comments[^4]:

> “Crimes are sometimes committed in a moment of folly and there are many young or first-time offenders who regret their actions and would never make repeat the mistake. Allowing for these minor offences to be “spent” spares them from being judged for life and affords them the much-needed second chance.”

68     It is clear that it is Parliament’s intention is for community based sentences to be used as an alternative sentencing option and the sentences are targeted at offenders who commit minor offences such as regulatory offences. They are also targeted at young offenders, first time offenders, or offenders with mental conditions.

69     In the present case, the Accused is neither a young offender nor is he suffering from any mental disorders. The offences in questions are also not regulatory offences.

70     Community based sentences as provided in Part XVII of the Criminal Procedure Code allows offenders who makes their first mistake of committing a crime to move on provided their offence is one that is not so serious as to preclude rehabilitation.

71     In the present case, while I note that the Accused has no previous antecedents, having considered all the circumstances, I am of the view that a SDO is not a suitable alternative sentencing option. My reasons are as follows:

> i.     The Accused is not a youthful offender. He was 28 years and turning 29 years old when he committed the offences.

> ii.     The Accused had committed not one but a series of offences. The 2 offences that the prosecution has proceeded on were in fact committed by the Accused whilst he was on agency bail and being investigated for earlier offences. This is clearly an aggravating factor for which specific deterrence is warranted.

> iii.     As explained earlier, I am also of the view that section 22(1)(a) offence is a serious offence and not a minor one as submitted by the Defence.

> iv.     Given the nature of the section 22(1)(a) offence and the other considerations, a custodial term is necessary to deter the Accused and likeminded others from committing similar offences in the future and also send a signal that the courts will not tolerate offences of such nature.

## What is the most appropriate sentence to be imposed in this case

72     For MAC 906773-2018, the punishment prescribed under section 379 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) is imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 years, or with fine, or with both.

73     As regards to the theft charge, I note that the Accused had stolen a motor cycle hand-phone mounting bracket valued at $45.00.

74     I note the commentary by the editors of the Practitioner’s Library, Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts, 3rd Edition, Volume 1m LexisNexis, 2013 \[at page 641\]:

> “The prosecutions brought under section 379 cover a wide range of situations, ranging from theft of small items committed on the spur of the moment, to highly organised high-value thefts ….

> The significant considerations which would affect the sentencing disposition would be the value of the stolen items, the nature and circumstances of the theft, age of the offender, prevalence of the offence and the offender’s criminal record (especially if it concerns property offences and offences involving dishonesty.

> Where the value of the stolen item is low (below $1,000) and the offender has a clean record, the sentence imposed will usually be a fine.”

75     With regard to the theft charge, I note that the item stolen is a low value item worth $45.00. The item stolen was also recovered by the police. I also note the following aggravating factors:

> a.     The Accused had committed this offence whilst on police bail.

> b.     The Accused also had another section 379 theft charge which was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

76     Taking into account all the above considerations, I am of the view that an appropriate sentence for the section 379 theft charge is $2,000 fine in default 2 weeks’ imprisonment.

77     For DAC 922361-2018, the punishment prescribed under section 22(1)(a) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184, 1997 Rev Ed) is imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years and an instrument or article found in the possession of that person shall be forfeited.

78     The table of sentencing precedents tendered by the Prosecution showed that the usual sentencing tariff imposed by the courts for a section 22(1)(a) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act offence where an offender who is untraced is caught with a knuckle duster in his possession is about 4 weeks to 1 month.

79     In the present case, the knuckleduster was found by the police in the Accused’s home when they went to his home to investigate another offence.

80     The Defence had argued that the Accused’s culpability is lower for the following reasons:

> a.     The knuckleduster was found in the Accused’s home. The Accused was not carrying the knuckleduster in public as compared to the precedents referred to by the Prosecution whereby the offenders in all the cases were caught with the knuckledusters outside their homes in a public place.

> b.     Section 22(1)(a) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act is targeted at thugs and gangsters[^5].The Accused does not fall within the usual class of offenders targeted by section 22(1)(a) as he does not have any violent-related antecedents and is not a member of any gang or secret society. The Accused was also not planning to use the knuckleduster to inflict violence on anyone or in the commission of any offence.

81     I acknowledge that the knuckleduster was found in the Accused’s home. I agree with the Defence that it is less serious to keep the knuckleduster at home than to be carrying the same in public. As such, I accept the Defence’s argument that this point should not be taken as an aggravating factor against the Accused. I also acknowledge that there is no evidence that the Accused was planning to use the knuckleduster in any manner or to commit a criminal act. However, I would point out that wherever you are in possession of a knuckle duster, whether in your own home or in public, the knuckleduster is a dangerous and unlawful weapon and it is still an offence to be in possession of the same.

82     As for the Defence’s contention that the Accused is not a gang member and that he was not planning to use the knuckleduster to inflict violence on anyone or in the commissioning of an offence, I note the Prosecution’s table of precedents which shows that the courts have imposed sentences of up to 3 months where the offenders had the intention to use the knuckleduster in the commissioning of a criminal act[^6].

83     The Defence also highlighted that the fact that the Accused’s offensive weapon was discovered while he was on police bail should not be an aggravating factor against the Accused. This is because the Accused has had the knuckleduster since his honeymoon in 2013. Given the circumstances, I am prepared to accept the Defence’s submission that this should not be taken as an aggravating factor against the Accused.

84     Some of the sentencing factors to be considered for a section 22(1)(a) offence would include the nature of the offensive/dangerous instrument, the location of the offence, whether the weapon was used in the commissioning of any offence or whether anyone was put in fear and whether there was any intention or plan by the Accused to use the weapon.

85     In the present case, having considered all the circumstances and the Accused’s mitigation, I am of the view that a fair and reasonable sentence to be imposed for the knuckleduster offence is 4 weeks’ imprisonment.

86     Given that I am not minded to call for a probation report, it would make no sense for me to impose a SDO for the knuckleduster offence if I am going to fine the Accused for the theft offence. The purpose of imposing a SDO is to give first offenders a chance so that they can erase the stigma of a criminal record by rendering the conviction spent after they have served the SDO. In the present case, even if I were to order the SDO for the knuckleduster offence, given the fine imposed for the theft charge and the 2 TIC charges, the Accused will still have a criminal record even after the conviction on the SDO is spent. This will not erase the stigma of a criminal record per se for the Accused as he would still have the criminal records for his other offences.

## My Sentence

87     In summary, having considered all the facts before me, including the submissions by both the Prosecution and the Defence and taking into account the Accused’s mitigation, I am of the view that the appropriate sentence to be imposed on the Accused is as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr"><colgroup><col width="15.5%"> <col width="37.8%"> <col width="46.7%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>S/No.</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge No.</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentence</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 922361-2018</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4 weeks’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">MAC 906773-2018</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$2000 fine in default 2 weeks’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Total Sentence:</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4 weeks’ imprisonment and $2,000 fine in default 2 weeks’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

I also ordered that knuckleduster which is the subject matter of DAC 922361-2018 be forfeited to the police for disposal.

88     The Accused is currently on bail pending appeal.
