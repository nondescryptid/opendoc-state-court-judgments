2       Upon his conviction, the accused person admitted to the remaining 5 charges and consented for them to be taken into consideration(TIC) for the purpose of sentencing. The 5 charges consist of 3 counts of consumption of drugs (LT2), 1 count of having drug taking utensils and 1 count of possession of drugs.

3       The accused was sentenced to serve a total of 12 years and 3 months’ imprisonment with 6 strokes of the cane. He is now appealing against his sentence.

## Statement of Facts (SOF)

4       The SOF which the accused admitted without any qualification disclosed the following material facts.

#### Background on the 1st Arrest

5       On 12 August 2018 at about 2.40 p.m., the accused was arrested by Police officers from Jurong Police Divisional Headquarters for drug-related offences at Block 371 Bukit Batok Street 31 #01-322, Singapore. The police officers searched him and the following items were found and seized:

a.     one straw and two packets containing granular substances (later marked “CSP-1”)

b.     one straw containing granular substances (later marked “CSP-2”), and

c.     one piece of aluminium foil, one glass pipe, one glass piece, two straws and three rubber tubes.

6       The accused was brought to the Jurong Police Divisional Headquarters for further investigation.

#### Facts relating to the 3rd charge – Possession of a Class A controlled drug – Diamorphine (DAC 941157-2018)

7       On 14 August 2018, the seized exhibit marked “CSP-1” and “CSP-2” were submitted to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis.

8       On 10 September 2018, Kwang Jia Yi, an analyst with the Illicit Drugs Laboratory from the HSA issued 2 certificates under section 16 of the MDA stating that the exhibits marked “CSP-1” and “CSP-2” were found to be one straw, two packets containing not less than 9.25 grams of granular/powdery substance and one straw pulverised and homogenised into a powdery substance containing not less than 0.78 grams of granular/powdery substance. The powdery substances from the 2 exhibits were analysed and found to contain, in total, not less than 0.16 gram of diamorphine, a Class A Controlled Drug listed under the MDA. The accused admitted possession of the said exhibits which he knew were Controlled Drugs and said that it was for his own consumption. He has thereby committed an offence under Section 8(a) of the MDA.

#### Background to the 2nd arrest

9       On 26 August 2018 at 3.00 p.m., the accused was again arrested by the Police Officers from the same police division at Block 375 Bukit Batok Street 31 for drug-related offences. A search was conducted on him and the following items were found and seized:

a.     three cut straws containing granular substances and nine coloured straws containing granular substances (later marked “C-1”)

b.     two packets containing crystalline substances (later marked “C-2”), and

c.     three lighters, five coloured straws, one tube, one glass pipe and one improvised small bottle with two tubes attached (later marked “C-3”).

10     The accused was then brought to the police division for further investigation.

#### Facts relating to the 5th charge - Consumption of a specified drug – Monoacetylmorphine (DAC 941159-2018)

11     Following his arrest on 26 August 2018, the accused provided two bottles of his urine samples which were sent to the HSA on 28 August 2018 for analysis. On 31 August 2018 and 3 September 2018, the HSA issued two certificates under section 16 of the MDA. These 2 certificates issued by 2 analysts with the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of HSA, namely Ng Chee Ann and Goh Mei Ling Evelyn, stated that upon analysis, the said urine samples of the accused was found to contain monoacetylmorphine, a Specified Drug listed under the MDA.

12     The accused admitted smoking “heroin” which is the street name for diamorphine, on 25 August 2018 by using the “chasing the dragon” method. He put some “heroin” on a piece of aluminium foil, heat the underside of the foil with a lighter and inhaled the fumes using a rolled-up paper. His urine samples were found to contain monoacetylmorphine as a result of his consumption of “heroin”.

13     Before the commission of the said offence, the accused was convicted on 26 July 2007 of an offence for consumption of a Specified Drug_, to wit_, monoacetylmorphine, under Section 8(b)(ii) and punishable under Section 33A (1) of the MDA and was sentenced to 5 years’ and 6 months’ imprisonment with 3 strokes of the cane, which conviction and sentence have not been set aside to-date. The accused shall now be punished under Section 33A (2) of the MDA.

#### Facts relating to the 8th charge – Possession of a Class A controlled drug – Methamphetamine (DAC 941162-2018)

14     On 28 August 2018, the exhibit marked “C-2” was submitted to the HSA for analysis. On 24 September 2018, Lim Yi Lin Elaine, an analyst with the Illicit Drugs Laboratory from the HSA issued a certificate under section 16 of the MDA, stating that the exhibit was found to be one packet containing not less than 0.24 grams of crystalline substance which was pulverized into a powdery substance and analysed to contain not less than 0.16 gram of methamphetamine, a Class A Controlled Drug under the MDA. The accused admitted ownership and possession of the aforesaid exhibit which he purchased from a male Malay known to him as “Zul” at Bukit Batok Street 31. He said that the said drug was for his own consumption. He has thereby committed an offence under Section 8(a) of the MDA.

#### Facts relating to DAC-941163-2018 – Possession of utensils for the purpose of drug taking

15     The accused admitted to the ownership of the exhibit marked “C-3”, namely three lighters, five coloured straws, one tube, one glass pipe and one improvised small bottle with two tubes attached. He intended to use the said exhibit to consume methamphetamine.

16     The accused is not authorised under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to have in his possession Class A Controlled Drugs, namely diamorphine and methamphetamine, to consume monoacetylmorphine, a Specified Drug and to have the aforesaid utensils intended for the consumption of methamphetamine.

17     Before the commission of the offences of possession of controlled drugs as stated in the preceding paragraphs, the accused was convicted on 8 May 2003, of an offence for possession of a Controlled Drug under Section 8(a) of the MDA and was sentenced to 3 years’ imprisonment, which conviction and sentence have not been set aside to-date. He shall now be punished with enhanced punishment under Section 33(1) of the MDA.

19     In addition, the accused had a DRC admission in 2002 and was subjected to 4 Drug Supervision Orders with the latest being on the 23 February 2018. The accused was also traced for other offences from 1991 to 2003 under the Penal Code, Copyright and Films Acts.

## The Sentence

20     In this case, the accused has been convicted of 4 counts under the MDA. The 4 counts comprise 1 count of consumption of a specified drug, namely, monoacetylmorphine, an LT2 charge, which carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 7 years imprisonment with 6 strokes of the cane and the maximum is 13 years imprisonment and 13 strokes of the cane. He has also been convicted of 2 counts of possession of Class A controlled drugs and since the accused is a repeat offender, the prescribed punishment is a mandatory minimum sentence of 2 years’ imprisonment and the maximum is 10 years’ imprisonment or a fine up to $20,000 or both. In respect of the drug taking utensils charge under section 9 of the MDA, the punishment is imprisonment up to 3 years or a fine of $10,000 or both.

21     The prosecution, in their written address on sentence, citing a number of aggravating factors sought a global sentence of 12 years, 9 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. For the individual sentences they submitted for a term of 9 years and 6 months’ imprisonment with 6 strokes of the cane for the LT2 charge, 3 years’ imprisonment for the first possession charge, 3 years and 3 months’ imprisonment for the second possession charge and 3 months’ imprisonment for the possession of drug taking utensils charge. They further submitted for the terms of imprisonment for the LT2 charge and the second possession charge to run consecutively. In mitigation, counsel for the accused described him as remorseful and said that he had consumed the drug because he was stressed. They submitted for a sentence of 9 years and 6 months’ imprisonment for the LT2 charge and 3 months’ imprisonment for the possession of drug taking utensils charge and to run the terms consecutively, which will then yield a global sentence of 9 years and 9 months’ imprisonment.

22     Considering that there are mandatory minimum sentences for the offence of LT2, consumption of specified drugs, which is the most serious charge the accused is facing, as it involves a substantial period of imprisonment plus caning, there can be no doubt that the law takes a serious view of such offences. Drug activities are regarded as a dreaded scourge and the predominant interest is the protection of society from the menace and social evils associated with drug abuse. Deterrence therefore takes centre stage in determining the appropriate sentence for offences under the MDA. With these considerations in mind, I turn to the facts of this case.

23     In respect of the LT2 offence, it was undisputed that this was not the first time that the accused was facing an LT2 charge. His records showed that he had first been convicted of an LT2 charge on the 22 June 2012 and he committed this current offence of LT2 on or about the 26 August 2018. This would have been well within a year after his release from prison as he would have been released on the 23 February, 2018 as the supervision order under the MDA was made on this date. In actuality, it was therefore within 6 months of his release. The fact that the accused had re-offended rather soon after his last stint in prison was an aggravating factor which I could not ignore. Obviously, the term of 9 years’ imprisonment that was imposed on him with the mandatory minimum 6 strokes of the cane did not have the desired and deterrent effect on him.

24     The other aggravating factor was the fact that the accused was first arrested on the 12 of August, 2018 and arising from this arrest, 4 charges under the MDA were preferred against him. He was released on station bail shortly thereafter and despite being fully aware that he was under investigation, the accused went on to commit another 6 offences under the MDA on the 26 of August 2018. Committing offences while on bail, even station bail, is definitely an aggravating factor. (See PP _v Loqmanul Hakim Bin Buang_ \[2007\] 4 SLR 753 and _Loo Pei Xiang Alan v PP_ \[2015\] SGHC 217). By so doing, the accused displayed a defiant attitude and demonstrated a disregard for the law and a recalcitrance that calls for an increased sentence on principles of specific deterrence and prevention. It puts a lie to his claim that he was remorseful. While it remains speculative, it may well be the case that if the accused had not been apprehended on the 26 of August, 2018, there was every possibility that he would have carried on committing more offences.

25     In so far as the sentence for the LT2 offence was concerned, it would appear that the prosecution and the defence were on the same page as the defence did not object to the prosecution’s proposal for an uplift of 6 months’ imprisonment from the sentence of 9 years’ imprisonment which was meted out in 2012. The defence had sensibly conceded that the mandatory minimum cannot be considered in the circumstances of this case. Further, while the accused had pleaded guilty to 1 count of an LT2 offence, there were 3 other similar charges which had been TIC for the purpose of sentencing with his consent. 2 of these offences as reflected in the 2 charges were committed in the first arrest on 12 August 2018 and the third on the second arrest of 26 August 2018. It is trite law that the approach the courts should adopt if there are TIC offences to be taken into account, the effect, in general would be that the sentence which the court would otherwise have imposed for the offence proceeded with would be increased. In this case, the accused did not just consume 1 type of specified drug as the charges indicated that he had consumed both diamorphine and methamphetamine.

26     The position of the prosecution and were also similar with regard to the offence under section 9 of the MDA of being in possession of drug taking utensils as the submission of a term of imprisonment of 3 months by the prosecution was not disputed by the defence. The utensils found on the accused and which he admitted possession of included three lighters, five coloured straws, one tube, one glass pipe and one improvised small bottle with two tubes. The usual sentencing range for such offences when an accused person pleads guilty at the first available opportunity is in the region of 2 to 4 months’ imprisonment. While I was of the view that 4 months would be more appropriate considering that the number of utensils was on the higher end and there was another similar charge that was TIC, I was prepared to agree with a 3-month imprisonment term for this offence.

27     I next turn my attention to the 2 drug possession offences. The prosecution had submitted for a term of 3 years’ imprisonment for the offence committed on the 12 of August 2018 and 3 years and 3 months’ imprisonment for the offence committed on the 26 of August 2018, seeking an uplift of 3 months. This is certainly not the first time the accused has committed a drug possession offence. His antecedent history indicated that he was first convicted for a drug possession offence in 1994, followed by the second one in 1995 and the most recent was in 2003 for which he was sentenced to 3 years’ imprisonment. The current offence would therefore be his fourth.

28     What the prosecution was seeking in terms of the individual sentences for the possession offences was rather measured considering that they were seeking the same sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment for the offence committed on the first arrest and an uplift of only 3 months for the second arrest of 26 August 2018. The defence had no position on the sentences for the possession offences. I was in agreement with the prosecution’submission on sentence for the possession offence since there was also another similar charge that was TIC, but exercising some leniency towards the accused I was prepared to impose a similar term of 3 years’ imprisonment for each possession offence.

29     Since all the 4 proceeded charges will carry imprisonment terms I was mindful of section 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, Cap. 68, which provides that where a person is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for at least 3 distinct offences, the court must order the sentences for at least 2 of those offences to run consecutively. The next issue I had to consider therefore was which 2 terms ought to run consecutively. On this issue I was guided by the case of _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ \[2014\] 2 SLR 998 where amongst other considerations, it was held that the 2 terms of imprisonment must include the longest sentence and the one transaction rule should not be infringed. In this case, it was not disputed that one of the terms must be the sentence for the LT2 offence. However, the defence sought for the sentence of 3 months’ imprisonment for the possession of drug taking utensils charge to run consecutively with the LT2 sentence of 9 years and 6 months’ imprisonment but the prosecution sought for the sentence of 3 years and 3 months’ imprisonment for the second possession offence to run consecutively instead.

30     I was not persuaded by the defence that sentence of 3 months’ imprisonment for the possession of drug taking utensils charge should run consecutively with the LT2 term of imprisonment. To do so, would actually mean that the accused does not receive any punishment for the 2 possession offences and he is not punished at all for the offences committed under the first arrest of 12 August 2018. This would not adequately reflect his culpability and it would not be sufficiently deterrent. It bears emphasis to reiterate that the 2 drug possession offences, which the accused committed for the fourth time, carried an enhanced mandatory punishment of at least 2 years per charge and there was a similar charge which was TIC. The accused was found to be in possession of 2 types of Class A controlled drugs, namely diamorphine and methamphetamine.

31     Under these circumstances I ordered the terms of imprisonment for the LT2 offence to run consecutively with the term of imprisonment for the drug possession offences of 3 years. In so doing, I calibrated the sentence of the LT2 offence slightly downwards by imposing a sentence of 9 years and 3 months’ imprisonment which is just an uplift of 3 months from the accused’s previous sentence of 9 years’ imprisonment for his first LT2 offence committed recently in 2012. The 2 offences of drug consumption and possession are different in nature and clearly distinct and ordering them to run consecutively would not breach the one-transaction rule. These 2 offences certainly relate to different legally protected interests. Exercising some leniency towards the accused I did not increase the number of strokes.

32     All considered, taking into account all the relevant factors including the plea in mitigation, I passed the following sentences on the accused:

33     The total sentence of the accused is therefore 12 years and 3 months’ imprisonment with 6 strokes of the cane, with effect from 28 August 2018 as the accused had been in remand since this date. He is currently serving his sentence.
