Civil Procedure – Discovery of documents – Specific discovery

Tort – Defamation – Malice

8 April 2019

### Deputy Registrar Hairul Hakkim:

## Introduction

1       This was an application for specific discovery brought by the plaintiff, Mr Nisban Jasmin (“the Plaintiff”), under O 24 r 5 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“the ROC”). While there were initially 39 defendants, 18 of them had thereafter dropped out of the action and the Plaintiff’s application was therefore only against the remaining 21 defendants, _ie_, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 12th, 13th, 15th, 18th, 19th, 20th, 21st, 23rd, 25th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 31st and 32nd defendants (collectively referred to as “the Defendants”).

## Background facts

2       The Plaintiff was at all material times the Honorary Treasurer of the Singapore Chess Federation (“SCF”).[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) He commenced an action in libel against 39 defendants in District Court Suit No 556 of 2016 (“the Defamation Suit”), alleging publication of defamatory statements in a requisition request dated 6 January 2016 and signed by, amongst others, these defendants (“the Requisition Request”). The request requisitioned an extraordinary general meeting to discuss and vote on the following matters:

(a)     that there was no confidence in the SCF’s current President (“Resolution 1”);

(b)     that there was no confidence in each member of the current executive committee (“Exco” or “SCF Council” and “Resolution 2”); and

(c)     that a new Exco be elected (“Resolution 3”).

3       The reasons for these resolutions were found in an accompanying undated letter (“Requisition Letter”). One of these reasons was the resignation of Ms Anjela Khegay, who had been employed as a trainer by SCF and who was stated to have been a victim of sexual misconduct at the hands of, amongst others, the Plaintiff (hereinafter referred to as the “Defamatory Statements”). The Plaintiff alleged that this part of the Requisition Letter was defamatory.

4       In their Defence, the Defendants pleaded defences of justification, qualified privilege and fair comment. In the Reply, the Plaintiff then pleaded malice in an attempt to defeat the defences of qualified privilege and fair comment[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) (malice is irrelevant to the defence of justification). The Plaintiff’s application for specific discovery was made pursuant to this pleading of malice.

## The application for specific discovery

5       The three category of documents sought by the Plaintiff were as follows:[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3)

(a)     all documents and correspondence between the 1st and 10th defendants and/or any other party containing the discussions relating to the reasons for the proposal to pass Resolutions 2 and 3 of the Requisition Request (“Category 1”);

(b)     all documents and correspondence between the 1st and 10th defendants and/or any other party relating to their resignation from the SCF Council (“Category 2”); and

(c)     all documents and correspondence provided to each of the 21 Defendants relating to the reasons for the signing of the Requisition Request before or at the point of signing the Requisition Request (“Category 3”).

## Parties’ submissions

6       The main legal principles involved were not in dispute. The courts will grant an order for specific discovery only if (a) the documents sought are relevant; and (b) there is sufficient evidence to show that the requested documents are in the possession, custody or power of the requested party. Once it is determined that the above two limbs are met, disclosure should be granted unless the documents requested are not necessary to either dispose fairly of the matter or for saving costs.

7       The Plaintiff argued that the documents requested are relevant to the pleaded issue of malice in the Defamation Suit. The Plaintiff’s primary evidence of malice was that, prior to the publication of the Requisition Request, a group of Exco members, spearheaded by the 1st and 10th defendants (“Camp 2”), had embarked on a series of unsuccessful measures to oust the other members in the Exco (“Camp 1”).[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4) This included a coordinated and mass resignation of Camp 2 members from the Exco on 23 October 2015, in an attempt to render the SCF Council short of the required quorum.[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5) This attempt failed, resulting in the Requisition Request being issued. Based on this, the Plaintiff alleged that the Requisition Letter (which included the Defamatory Statements) were made for an improper and/or ulterior motive or was made without any honest belief in the truth of its contents.

8       The Defendants argued that the Plaintiff’s request was too wide and amounted to a “fishing expedition”. This was because the Requisition Letter penned six different reasons for the Requisition Request but only one of which pertains to the subject matter of the Defamation Suit.[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) As such, requesting discovery in respect of the entire Requisition Request was both irrelevant and not necessary for the Defamation Suit. Further, it was argued that the reasons for putting up the Requisition Request concerned the entire Exco; it would not shed light on the specific question of whether malice was directed at the Plaintiff in the making of the Defamatory Statements.

9       While the Defendants had also argued in their written submissions that the court had no jurisdiction to grant the order because the Plaintiff did not satisfactorily demonstrate that the documents are within the possession, custody or power of the Defendants, their counsel retracted from this contention during the oral hearing before me. Accordingly, the Defendants’ grounds for resisting the Plaintiff’s application were only on the basis that:

(a)     the documents are irrelevant; and

(b)     the documents are not necessary for the purposes of the Defamation Suit.

## My decision

10     Having considered the parties’ submissions, I was satisfied that the documents requested are relevant to the pleaded issue of whether the Defendants were actuated by malice in making the Defamatory Statements and that these documents are within the possession, custody or power of the Defendants. I was also satisfied that these documents are necessary to the Defamation Suit. Before I examine each Category separately, I start by making some general observations on the Plaintiff’s application.

### General observations

11     From a perusal of the relevant pleadings, I was convinced that the Plaintiff’s application for specific discovery arose out of its pleaded case. In particular, from a reading of paragraphs 28-34 of the Plaintiff’s Reply,[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7) it was clear to me that the relevant particulars of malice relied upon by the Plaintiff had been sufficiently set out. This directly refuted the Defendants’ contention that the Plaintiff’s application was akin to “fishing”. Here, the Plaintiff was neither “fishing” for a cause of action nor seeking discovery in respect of an allegation that was not pleaded (see _Tan Chin Seng and others v Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd_ at \[19\]).

12     The Defendants attempted to counter this point by citing a passage from the _Singapore Civil Procedure 2018_ vol I (Foo Chee Hock JC gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 2018) at para 24/1/8 to argue that “discovery is not required of documents that relate to irrelevant allegations in pleadings”. This was however of little assistance because the principle presupposes _irrelevant_ allegations in pleadings. As such, the foremost question instead was whether the Plaintiff’s pleaded allegations on malice were irrelevant to begin with, necessitating a closer consideration of the pleadings.

13     The Plaintiff pleaded as follows: (a) the Defendants lacked an honest belief in the contents of the Defamatory Statements and/or (b) that the Requisition Request was made with improper motive.[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8)

14     In my judgment, these are _relevant_ allegations in relation to the issue of whether the Defendants were actuated by malice in making the Defamatory Statements. In reaching this determination, I was guided principally by the scope of malice that can be relied upon by the Plaintiff in law.

15     Before I discuss that issue, I pause to highlight a point on which the parties’ submissions were unclear. Malice operates differently in both the defences of fair comment and qualified privilege (see Professor Gary Chan, _The Law of Torts in Singapore_ (Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2016) (“_The Law of Torts_”) at paras 13.092–13.095). In the context of fair comment, malice would be shown where the defendant did not genuinely believe in what he stated. On the other hand, for the defence of qualified privilege, malice could be proved by showing _either_ that the defendant was actuated by an _improper or ulterior motive_ or that he did not believe that the statement was true or was reckless as to the truth of the statements. In other words, for the defence of fair comment, the presence of an improper motive, without more, is insufficient to amount to malice (_The Law of Torts_ at paras 13.033 and 13.037). From the above, it is also apparent that one common feature underlying both defences is the lack of an honest belief in the truth of the statement.

### Scope of malice

16     Returning to the main issue, the primary bone of contention between the parties was how far the Plaintiff could go to show existence or inference of malice. Here, the Defendants argued that only malice _specifically_ directed against the Plaintiff in the publication of the Defamatory Statements could be considered. I was not convinced by this narrow construction for two reasons.

17     First, the Defendants’ contention was inconsistent with the legal principles on proving malice, at least in relation to the defence of qualified privilege. The Court of Appeal stated in _Nirumalan K Pillay and others v A Balakrishan and others_ (“_Nirumalan_”) at \[12\] that “\[m\]alice in the law of defamation is extremely broad” and that it also includes “any improper motive on the part of the respondents in publishing the article”. Therefore, there was no need for any ill will or spite to be specifically targeted at the Plaintiff as long as the Defendants had any improper or ulterior motive in making the Defamatory Statements as part of the Requisition Request. In this regard, the Plaintiff also highlighted cases where the courts have considered the background dispute between different groups of parties in deciding whether there was malice (for instance, the history of bad blood considered in _Chiam See Tong v Ling How Doong and others_ at \[74\]–\[75\]).

18     Second, the Defendants’ attempt at drawing a principled distinction was divorced from the reality of the factual situation. The Defamatory Statements cannot be considered in vacuum; they arose in the context of a long-standing tension between the two opposing Camp members (including the Plaintiff as one of the Camp 1 members). One does not need to go further than the records of the WhatsApp conversation between Mr Melvyn Yeo (“Mr Yeo”) (a Camp 1 member) and the 10th defendant to demonstrate this fact.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9) Seen against that context, it would be artificial to ignore the reasons and motivations behind the entire Requisition Request and to neatly sever only the specific reasons in respect of the Defamatory Statements. I must stress that the Defamatory Statements arose in the context of the Requisition Request, and appeared to be the culmination of the bad blood between the opposing Camp members. Based on this, it was relevant and reasonable to consider the facts and events leading up to the Requisition Request, as a whole, to decide whether the request was a genuine attempt by the Defendants to communicate out of public interest (_ie_, qualified privilege) or whether it was directed with any improper motive against the Camp 1 members (which included the Plaintiff).

19     On the question of whether it would be _necessary_ to order disclosure, in the specific context of this case, if the documents requested are adjudged to be relevant to the issue of malice, it would follow in my view that they are also necessary to _fairly_ dispose of the case (see O 24 r 7 of the ROC). It must be borne in mind that without these documents, the Plaintiff could effectively have no basis to refute the defences of qualified privilege and fair comment raised by the Defendants in the Defamation Suit. That would not be a _fair_ outcome. This was not a case where the documents requested were merely tangential or peripheral to the issue of liability; instead, these documents may be determinative of the same.

20     I turn now to briefly deal with the documents requested within each Category.

### The requested categories of documents

#### Category 1 documents

21     The first category concerned the documents and correspondence in respect of the discussions between, amongst others, the 1st and 10th defendants relating to the reasons to pass Resolutions 2 and 3 of the Requisition Request (see \[2\] above).

22     The Plaintiff argued that this category would show whether the 1st defendant, 10th defendant or any other party had the dominant motivation to injure the Plaintiff and whether any of them knew that the grounds of the resolutions were false or whether they were reckless as to its truth.

23     On this note, the Plaintiff also referred to an earlier joint letter dated 8 October 2015 written by the 1st and 10th defendants and another third party known as Dr Chan Weng Kee (“earlier Joint Letter”).[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10) The Plaintiff averred that the grounds stated in the Requisition Letter were “substantially reproduced” from the earlier Joint Letter.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11)

24     From a perusal of the respective letters, I was convinced that at least the grounds of the Defamatory Statements were similar in both letters. The other reasons unrelated to the Defamatory Statements were also broadly similar and it appeared to me that the Requisition Letter had been prepared by merely editing the earlier Joint Letter. On balance, the evidence suggested that the 1st and 10th defendants were amongst the originators of both the Defamatory Statements as well as the Requisition Letter. It followed that their reasons for putting up the Requisition Request would be relevant to the consideration of whether they were actuated by any improper motive in making the Defamatory Statements and/or whether they were reckless as to the truth of the Defamatory Statements.

25     Following from that, there was also no basis for me to conclude that the documents are not necessary for the purposes of the Defamation Suit and I accordingly allowed discovery of the same.

#### Category 2 documents

26     The second category related to the documents and correspondence disclosing the reasons for the resignation of the 1st and 10th defendants from the SCF Council.

27     I was convinced that the Category 2 documents are relevant and necessary to the Defamation Suit. These documents could potentially speak to the issue of whether the Defendants were actuated by any improper or ulterior motive in the making of the Defamatory Statements.

28     The principle that malice extends to such considerations was acknowledged by the Defendants themselves in their written submissions, where they cited Professor Gary Chan in _The Law of Torts_ as follows (at para 13.087):[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12)

Malice may be proved by the defendant’s improper or ulterior motive in making the statement if he acted with the dominant motive to injure the plaintiff; or acted with spite or ill-will towards the plaintiff; or abused the occasion to obtain some private advantage unconnected with the duty or the interest which constituted the reason for the privilege.

29     The Plaintiff’s case was that the ulterior motive of the Camp 2 members was to oust the Camp 1 members from the SCF Council. The Camp 2 members first attempted to do so by forcing a re-election through mass resignation, and when this attempt failed, they proceeded to publish the Requisition Request and Letter.[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13) Based on the evidence adduced, especially given the contents of the WhatsApp conversation between Mr Yeo and the 10th defendant, the Plaintiff’s version of events seemed the likely one. In that sense, the Requisition Request was linked to the earlier mass resignation attempt. It followed that this category of documents concerning the mass resignation attempt would be relevant to either prove or disprove whether any of the Camp 2 members had any ulterior motive in making the Defamatory Statements.

30     I was also not convinced by the explanation from the 1st defendant as to the reasons for the Camp 2 members’ resignation from the SCF Council. The 1st defendant referred to the sanctions imposed by the ASEAN Chess Confederation (“the ACC sanctions”) as the main reason.[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14) This explanation was however clearly contradicted by the evidence adduced by the Plaintiff. The ACC sanctions were only proposed on 10 October 2015. However, the WhatsApp conversation records between the 10th defendant and Mr Yeo showed that the proposed mass resignation by the Camp 2 members had already been contemplated _since September 2015_, at least a month before the ACC sanctions were announced.[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15)

31     For similar reasons, there was also no basis for me to find that the documents in Category 2 are not necessary for the purposes of the Defamation Suit.

#### Category 3 documents

32     Lastly, I was also convinced that the documents requested in Category 3 (_ie_, the correspondence and documents provided to the Defendants relating to the reasons for the signing of the Requisition Request) are relevant to the issue of malice in connection with the Defamatory Statements. More specifically, this category of documents is likely to be relevant to the issue of whether the Defendants genuinely believed the Defamatory Statements (see _Oei Hong Leong_ v _Ban Seng Long David and others_ at \[52\] for fair comment) or whether they were reckless as to the truth of the statements (see _Lee Kuan Yew v Davies Derek Gwyn_ for qualified privilege).

33     In my judgment, it was also _necessary_ for each of the 21 Defendants to respond to the Plaintiff’s application. As noted by the Court of Appeal in _Nirumalan_ at \[33\], a plaintiff alleging malice has to prove it “on the part of _each_ of the defendants” who rely on the defence \[emphasis in original\], not merely against the defendant who wrote the original offending statement.

## Conclusion

34     Accordingly, I granted the Plaintiff’s application for specific discovery for all the three categories of documents sought and fixed costs in his favour to be paid by the Defendants in the sum of $2400 (inclusive of disbursements and GST).

35     In closing, it would be remiss of me not to thank counsel for their able assistance on both the factual and legal aspects of this case.
