### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## Background

1       During the early hours of 12 November 2017, the police had conducted a routine spot check on the various clubs at the now defunct St James Power Station. In the course of their checks, they had responded to an emergency call concerning a fight that had taken place at the dance floor of Envy Dance Club (“Club Envy”). While on his way to respond to the call near the entrance of Club Envy, one of the police officers Sergeant Tan You Chuen (“the victim”) conducted a check on a group of persons including the three accused persons in the present case. They were Leong Yin Teng Coretta (“Leong”), Marcus Goh Jun Fong (“Goh”) and Lim Yang Horng (“Lim”). In the course of the victim’s interaction with the group, Lim had punched the victim in his face. A scuffle broke out between the victim and the accused persons eventually resulting in their arrest. The victim suffered minor injuries to his head. The three accused persons were arrested and were subsequently charged in court.

2       The three accused persons had claimed trial to the following:

> (a)     One charge each under s 332 read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) and

> (b)     In relation to Lim, one additional charge under s 6(3) of the Protection of Harassment Act (Cap 256A, 2015 Rev Ed).

3       The individual charges against them were as follow:

> (a)     For Leong in **DAC 940611-2017**:

>> “…are charged that you, on 12 November 2017, at or about 4.10 a.m., at Envy Dance Club located at Block 3 Sentosa Gateway Saint James Power Station, Singapore, together with Lim Yang Horng and Marcus Goh Jun Fong, and in furtherance of the common intention of you all, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Police Sgt (2) Tan You Chuen (“the Victim”), a public servant, with intent to prevent him from discharging his duty as such public servant, _to wit_, by grabbing his neck forcefully and pulling it with either one or both arms, causing him to suffer minute swelling over the left temporal region with minimal tenderness and soft tissue trauma secondary to head injury, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 332 read with Section 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).”

> (b)     For Goh in **DAC 940612-2017**:

>> “…are charged that you, on 12 November 2017, at or about 4.10 a.m., at Envy Dance Club located at Block 3 Sentosa Gateway Saint James Power Station, Singapore, together with Lim Yang Horng and Leong Yin Teng Coretta, and in furtherance of the common intention of you all, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Police Sgt (2) Tan You Chuen (“the Victim”), a public servant, with intent to prevent him from discharging his duty as such public servant, _to wit_, by punching the Victim at least once, causing him to suffer minute swelling over the left temporal region with minimal tenderness and soft tissue trauma secondary to head injury, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 332 read with Section 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).”

> (c)     For Lim in **DAC 940613-2017** and **MAC 912583-2017**:

1 st Charge (Re-amended)

>> “…are charged that you, on 12 November 2017, at or about 4.10 a.m., at Envy Dance Club located at Block 3 Sentosa Gateway Saint James Power Station, Singapore, together with Marcus Goh Jun Fong and Leong Yin Teng Coretta, and in furtherance of the common intention of you all, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Police Sgt (2) Tan You Chuen (“the Victim”), a public servant, with intent to prevent him from discharging his duty as such public servant, _to wit_, by punching him at least three times on his face and head, causing him to suffer minute swelling over the left temporal region with minimal tenderness and soft tissue trauma secondary to head injury, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 332 read with Section 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).”

2 nd Charge (Amended)

>> are charged that you, on 12 November 2017, at or about 4.10 a.m., at Envy Dance Club located at Block 3 Sentosa Gateway Saint James Power Station, Singapore, did use abusive words towards one Police Officer, Sgt (2) Tan You Chuen, a public servant, in relation to the execution of his duty as such public servant, _to wit_, by saying the words “_fuck you, cheebye_” in a mixture of English and Hokkien dialect, which means “_Fuck you, cunt_” in the English language, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 6(1)(a) punishable under Section 6(3) of the Protection from Harassment Act, Chapter 256A.

4       At the conclusion of the trial, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt on all the respective charges against the three accused persons. Accordingly, I found them guilty and convicted them of their respective charges. After hearing the Prosecution’s address on sentence and their respective pleas in mitigation, I imposed the following sentences:

5       The three accused persons are dissatisfied with their respective convictions and the sentences. They have each filed notices of appeal against their convictions and the sentences. Leong Yin Teng Coretta and Marcus Goh Jun Fong are currently on bail pending the hearing of their appeals while Lim Yang Horng had elected to commence serving his sentence from 1 July 2020 and had not paid the court fine. His earliest date of release is on 27 January 2021.

6       I now provide the reasons for my decision.

## The Parties’ Cases

7       It was the Prosecution’s case that the incident at Club Envy arose soon after the victim had identified himself as a police officer to the group of persons including the three accused persons as he initially thought they were involved in the fight and had told them to leave the club if they were not involved. It was submitted that for reasons best known to Lim and while under the influence of alcohol at the time, he had taken umbrage at the manner the victim had questioned him. It was also submitted that Lim was also probably annoyed that the fun and good mood which he and his friends were having had ended abruptly because of the fight at the dance floor.

8       It was also the Prosecution’s case that Lim then lashed out at the victim by hurling vulgarities at him despite knowing he was a plainclothes police officer. The victim responded by first questioning and thereafter trying to effect an arrest on Lim. This sparked a chain of events that spiralled into violence against the victim where all three accused persons, with the common intention of them all, voluntarily caused hurt to the victim to prevent him from discharging his duty as a police officer to arrest Lim.

9       According to the Prosecution, Lim had punched the victim at least three times on his face, particularly, his left temporal region. Although Goh had initially tried to stop Lim from assaulting the victim, Goh soon joined in and punched the left side of the victim’s face at least once. Leong in turn had grabbed the victim’s neck forcefully with either one or both her arms, pulled it in an arm lock while telling the other members of their group to leave.

10     It was the Defence’s case that on the night of 11 November 2017, the accused persons met some friends for drinks at Club Viva in St James Power Station. It had started out as merry night for this group of friends celebrating Goh’s confirmation of his employment and the end of examinations for another of their friends. A misunderstanding between Lim and the victim put an end of the celebratory mood and – within a minute – quickly descended into a scuffle, eventually culminating in the arrest of all three accused persons.

11     The Defence did not dispute that Lim had assaulted the victim but contended that Lim did not have the requisite intention to commit the offence under s 332 of the Penal Code as he did not know that the victim was a public servant going about his duties. According to his Defence Counsel, the victim had not identified himself as a police officer nor would an ordinary person have knowledge of his identity in the circumstances. It was the Defence’s case that the victim’s behaviour was aggressive and wholly inconsistent with that which is expected of a police officer. Lim had thought that the victim was a patron looking for trouble and he did not have any reason to think that the victim was a public servant going about his duties.

12     It was the Defence’s case that Goh did not punch the victim. He did not intend to prevent the victim from discharging his duty as a public servant because he did not know that the victim was discharging such duty. Goh initially tried to stop the fight by trying to block Lim’s punches from behind Lim. As this was ineffective, he got between Lim and the victim to stop the fight by separating them. He moved himself to Lim’s left and started blocking Lim’s punches by reaching his right hand across Lim’s body while facing the victim.

13     It was also the Defence’s case that Leong was unaware that the victim was a police officer until the scuffle was over. She had no intention to prevent him from discharging his public duty. Leong was trying to break up a fight and she could not have formed any intention to prevent the victim from effecting Lim’s arrest. Although it was undisputed that Leong put her left hand lightly on the victim’s shoulder, she had tightened her grip on the victim because he had surged forward and she fell down twice.

14     It was the Defence’s case that there was no common intention by the accused persons to cause hurt to the victim to prevent him from discharging any public duties. Both Goh and Leong had tried to break up the fight between Lim and the victim and the accused persons had not shared the common intention to cause hurt to the victim to deter him from discharging his public duties. It was the Defence’s case that there was no common intention between the accused persons as the actions of Goh and Leong towards the victim were guided by motivations that were vastly different from Lim.

## Issues to be determined

15     The issues for my determination at trial were as follows:

> (a)     Did the accused persons know that the victim was a public servant in the discharge of his duty as such public servant at the material time?

> (b)     Did the accused persons participate in a criminal act?

> (c)     If they each participated in a criminal act, did the accused persons do so in furtherance of a common intention to voluntarily cause hurt to the victim with the intent to prevent him from arresting Lim;

> (d)     Did Lim use abusive words on the victim in relation to the execution of his duty as a public servant?

## The Law

16     In relation to the charge under s 332 read with s 34 of the Penal Code, the main elements are:

> (a)     The accused persons each participated in a criminal act that is done in furtherance of the common intention to voluntarily cause hurt to the victim;

> (b)     The accused persons know the victim is a public servant; and

> (c)     The hurt caused to the victim was done with the intent to prevent him from discharging his duty as a public servant.

17     In order to determine whether common intention applies to make the accused persons liable for diverse acts committed by them, the following three elements must be present:

> (a)     Criminal act—the aggregate of all the diverse acts done by the accused persons collectively give rise to the section 332 Penal Code offence;

> (b)     In furtherance of the common intention—all three accused persons intended or knew it likely to cause hurt to the victim in order to prevent him discharging his duty as a public servant, which can be inferred from their conduct and all the other relevant circumstances of the case, and that common intention can be formed on the spot; and

> (c)     The accused persons participated in the causing of hurt to the victim in furtherance of the common intention of them all.

18     In relation to the charge under s 6(3) of the Protection of Harassment Act (“POHA”), the elements are:

> (a)     Lim had used abusive words;

> (b)     The words were used towards a public servant, namely the victim and

> (c)     The said public servant was in the execution of his duty as a public servant.

## UNDISPUTED FACTS

19     The relevant undisputed facts were as follow:

> (a)     In the early morning of 12 November 2017, the victim together with his colleagues from the Singapore Police Force including Sergeant Wee Wei Xiong (“PW2”), Sergeant Muhammad Afif bin Mustafa (“PW3”), Sergeant Nashahrudin bin Fasulludi (“PW4”) and Station Inspector Muhammad Yazid bin Umar (“PW5”) conducted a routine raid at the various clubs in St James Power Station. The police officers had worn yellow ‘Police’ vests or their police lanyards with their warrant cards attached;

> (b)     From 11 November 2017 to the following morning, the accused persons were drinking with a group of friends, which included Mervyn Lee Wei Lun (“DW4”) and Yiap Chun Kang (“DW5”). They were initially at Club Viva before moving over to Club Envy;

> (c)     On 12 November 2017 at about 4.04am, a First Information Report (“FIR") was lodged relating to a fight that happened at the dance floor of Club Envy. The victim and his colleagues responded to this FIR;

> (d)     The CCTV footage obtained from Club Envy captured the accused persons’ group walking from the dance floor area to a table near the entrance/exit of the club. The victim was initially standing near them, holding his mobile phone to his right ear. He was then seen walking away in the direction of the dance floor;

> (e)     The victim was in plainclothes and was wearing a police lanyard with his police warrant card attached to it;

> (f)     There was an exchange of words between Lim and the victim. Lim spoke to the victim in an aggressive/challenging tone and utters the words “fuck you, chee bye” at the victim;

> (g)     Lim threw the first punch at the victim. A struggle ensued between the victim and Lim. Lim had assaulted the victim by punching him at least three times and one of the punches caused the victim’s spectacles to fly off;

> (h)     Shortly after Lim threw the first punch, Goh and Leong joined in the fray between the victim and Lim. Both of them were in close proximity with the victim. In the course of the fray, Leong had put her left hand on the victim’s right shoulder but had tightened her grip on his shoulder subsequently;

> (i)     PW3 and PW4 came to victim’s assistance and tried to break up the ongoing struggle with the three accused persons but were not successful. The incident which lasted over one minute ended when Club Envy bouncers, along with PW5, approached the accused persons’ group and shone their torchlights at them;

> (j)     The victim sought medical attention at Alexandra Hospital’s Acute Care Clinic (ACC) at 6.19am on 12 November 2017 and was discharged with pain relief medication and advice after being treated for head injury following an assault. The victim was given two days’ medical leave from 12 to 13 November 2017;

> (k)     Later that afternoon, at about 2.27pm, the victim made a second visit to ACC because there was some new onset minimal swelling over the assault site. The victim’s injuries consisted of minute swelling over the left temporal region with minimal tenderness. He was treated for soft tissue trauma following head injury and was discharged with head injury advice.

## The Prosecution’s Case

20     The Prosecution had called nine witnesses to prove their case against the three accused persons. The material aspects of their evidence is set out below.

### The victim’s account

21     The victim had testified on the sequence of events before and during the assault on him by the accused persons. The victim had seen the accused persons’ group coming from the dance floor area and stopped near the entrance of Club Envy. He initially suspected them to be involved in the fight at the dance floor and questioned them if they were involved in the fight. However, no reply was forthcoming from them and he told them to leave the club immediately if they were not involved.

22     According to the victim, he had used a firm tone to question them and Lim had responded in a challenging manner, “_Why should I leave the club?”_ The victim gave evidence that he had asked the accused persons’ group to leave the club so as not complicate the situation further by going back to the dance floor as there was a slight possibility that they might ‘sandwich’ his officers at the dance floor _ie_, potentially causing his officers to get hurt while attending to the fight at the dance floor. In response to Lim’s challenge, the victim had identified himself that he was from the police.

23     The victim gave evidence that he turned around and wanted to move away from the group but he heard a male voice from the group say “_fuck you, police”_. This was when he turned around and asked the group, “What did you say?” Lim responded by gesturing and uttering the words “_fuck you, chee bye police”_ which the victim felt was very degrading and offensive towards the police.

24     The victim testified that he wanted to make a check on him and potentially place him under arrest by trying to pin him against the wall to effect an arrest. While doing so, Lim punched the victim on the left side of his face. Lim then threw a second punch while the victim was holding on to him causing his spectacles to fall. Lim continued to rain punches on the victim and at that moment, there was a scuffle between him and the three accused persons.

25     The victim testified that after Lim had punched him, he initially saw Goh trying to stop the fight and pulled Lim away from hitting him. The victim was holding onto Lim’s shirt collar at the time. However, he saw Goh then joined in and punched him on the left side of his head once time. He felt pain after the punch. After being punched by Goh, the victim then also grabbed Goh’s shirt and while he doing so, Leong grabbed and pulled his neck from the back with a strong force such that the victim could not breathe properly. During the scuffle while the three accused persons were assaulting the victim, the latter called out to PW3, who was near him, to call for back up. He also shouted that he was from the police.

26     It was the Prosecution’s case that the victim’s evidence on the sequence of events was logical and coherent. In particular, it was submitted that the victim’s purpose that morning at Club Envy was to respond to an emergency at the dance floor and to maintain law and order. His purpose was not to spot check or pick on any particular group. This explained why the victim had asked the accused persons’ group to leave if they were not involved in the fight. It was further submitted that this was demonstrated by the victim focusing his attention more towards the dance floor and not at the accused persons’ group as captured in the CCTV footage.

27     It was highlighted that at no point did the victim try to stop anyone in the accused persons’ group from leaving. It was only when Lim uttered the vulgarities at the victim that he had to turn around and respond to Lim. This was because a _prima facie_ offence under s 6(3) POHA had potentially been committed by Lim and the victim was obliged to investigate further since he was, after all, performing is duty as a police officer that morning.

#### CCTV Footage from Club Envy

28     It was the Prosecution’s case that the victim’s testimony was corroborated by the Club Envy CCTV footage in _Exhibit P7_:

> (a)     Timestamp 4:09:28 am to 4:09:44 am – the victim was seen trying to make a phone call on his mobile phone to the Ops room and his attention appears focused on the dance floor. The accused persons’ group was seen coming from the dance floor towards the victim’s direction and it is submitted to be within his field of vision;

> (b)     Timestamp 4:09:44 am to 4:09:54 am – the victim was seen turning his body towards the accused persons’ group for about 4 to 5 seconds before moving off in the direction of the dance floor. This largely corroborated with his evidence as set out above;

> (c)     Timestamp 4:09:54 am to 4:09:59 am – the victim’s attention was ostensibly turned towards the accused persons’ group. He turned around and faced the direction of the accused persons’ group and walks towards them. The victim had testified that this was when he heard a male voice say “fuck you police”. This corroborated the victim evidence as stated above;

> (d)     Timestamp 4:10:00 am to 4:10:07 am – the victim could be seen engaging the accused persons’ group;

> (e)     Timestamp 4:10:08 a.m. to 4:10:11 a.m. – the victim walked away from the accused persons’ group but Lim appears to throw a punch towards the victim. The victim spun around and moved towards Lim to restrain him against the wall and then placed him under arrest. A scuffle between them begins at this point as corroborated by the victim’s testimony.

29     It was the Prosecution’s case that the victim’s evidence on whether he had verbally identified himself as a police officer and that he called out to PW3 to arrest Lim remained unshaken during his cross-examination. In particular, the victim had clearly answered that he recalled identifying himself as a police officer twice—the first time was to the accused persons’ group before Lim assaulted him and the second time was during the assault.

30     It was submitted that this aspect of the victim’s evidence was also corroborated by the testimonies of PW3 and PW5 namely:

> (a)     After Lim had punched the victim, PW3 had heard the latter say to arrest Lim but he was stopped by Leong;

> (b)     After receiving information that a police officer was being assaulted, PW5 had proceeded from the dance floor towards the spot where the accused persons and the victim were. He heard the victim shouting “mata”, which is a Malay word to mean the Police;

31     It was submitted that while PW2 had stated in cross-examination that he did not hear the victim identify himself as a police officer, his answer must be seen in context. This is because PW2 had testified during his examination-in-chief that he could neither hear the conversation between the victim and the accused persons’ group nor recall the tone of their conversation. It was the Prosecution’s case that on this point, PW2’s evidence was at best neutral and not damning against the victim’s credibility.

32     It was further submitted that while DW4 had testified during his cross-examination that he did not hear the victim identify himself as a police officer, his testimony ought to be treated with caution. This is because later during the cross-examination, DW4 had conceded that he “_really didn’t notice what happened prior to that scuffle”_ because it was noisy. His main focus was to “_exit the club”_ and thus did not “pay _attention small details of every part that happened prior to the scuffle_”. Thus, his evidence was not helpful to assist to corroborate the Defence’s claim that he did not positively hear the victim identify himself as a police officer.

### A.   The accused persons knew the victim was a public servant in the discharge of his duties as a public servant

33     It was the Prosecution’s case that each of the accused persons knew that the victim was a police officer on duty at the material time. In particular, it was undisputed that Goh knew that he was such a police officer in the discharge of his duties whereas both Lim and Leong had objective knowledge of the same based on the surrounding circumstances.

#### Goh admits that he knew the victim was a police officer on duty

34     Goh had testified that he knew, right from the beginning, that the victim was a plainclothes police officer who was on duty performing a “raid” at Club Viva in the early morning of 12 November 2017 because both he and DW4 had spoken to the victim’s police colleague and that the former was with his colleague. It was submitted that that Goh also did not dispute this knowledge of the victim’s identity and his discharge of his duty as a police officer while the accused persons were at Club Envy as well. It was the Prosecution’s case that it had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Goh knew that the victim was a public servant in the discharge of his duty as one.

#### The victim’s police lanyard was visible and obvious

35     It was the Prosecution’s case that it undisputed that the victim wore a police lanyard containing his warrant card when performing his duty at St James Power Station on the morning of 12 November 2017. It was submitted from the CCTV footage (“_Exhibit P7_”) the victim’s police lanyard containing his warrant card was plainly obvious as it hung down in front of his chest. It was further submitted that it was not obstructed by any article of clothing. It was also not camouflaged by the colour of his shirt; on the contrary, it was clearly contrasted with the lighter shade of his shirt. It was also the Prosecution’s case that the fact that it was plainly conspicuous on the victim had also been admitted by Lim and Leong upon viewing _Exhibit P7_.

36     It was highlighted that Counsel for Lim had argued that the mere wearing of the police lanyard with a warrant card could not automatically mean that an ordinary person would have the knowledge that he was a police officer. It was further claimed that lanyards are an accessory that is commonly worn by patrons and brand promoters in nightlife venues for various purposes such as to identify themselves as brand promoters.

37     In response to this, it was submitted that this was merely a bare assertion and the Defence had led no evidence to substantiate this claim. Second, and more crucially, it was submitted that both Lim and Leong possessed the knowledge that police officers could be identified by their wearing a police lanyard with a warrant card. During their cross-examination, both Lim and Leong testified that they have gone clubbing before and are aware that the police conduct checks or raids in clubs. They were aware that these officers usually are in plainclothes but wear lanyards to identify themselves as police officers; and they can identify a police officer by virtue of the lanyard that he is wearing. It was the Prosecution’s case that an ordinary person in Lim and Leong’s position as relatively experienced clubbers would _objectively_ be able to know the difference between a police officer wearing a police lanyard and some other club employee wearing a different lanyard.

38     On the question of whether both Lim and Leong were cognisant of the victim’s police lanyard and thereby knew or had reason to believe that the victim was a police officer, it was submitted that they would have both able to see it and their respective denials otherwise were incredulous.

39     It was the Prosecution’s case that Lim’s claim that he would not have known the victim was a police officer at the material time was contrived. Firstly, it was unbelievable that Lim would not have seen the victim’s police lanyard (which Lim had agreed had hung so prominently and obviously around his neck) when the victim’s body had turned towards the direction of his group and was at that point only one arm’s length away from Lim. Even if Lim had not seen the victim’s police lanyard at that point, he would have been able to see it again when the victim approached the accused persons’ group at 4:09:59 am. From the CCTV footage, the victim could be seen standing close to the group. Indeed, even the accused persons’ friend, DW4 had testified that he saw the victim’s police lanyard when he was charging towards Lim, and knew that he was a police officer.

40     Secondly, Lim had given a s 22 Criminal Procedure Code (“CPC”) statement to Inspector Shawn Yapp @ Shahril bin Mohd Sharhan (“PW1”) in _Exhibit P8_, which indicates that Lim knew that the victim was a police officer. In his statement, Lim had stated that “_we partied at Club Viva till past midnight and then made our way to Club Envy”_. Lim then described a raid occurred, and he and his friends left the club. While at the entrance, he stated that after he was allowed to leave the club by a guy wearing a yellow vest, “_a Chinese guy who is in plainclothes informed the yellow vest guy that we couldn’t leave and had to go back inside”_. Lim knows that the meaning of the term “_plainclothes”_ refers to a police officer in civilian wear. From the statement, it was submitted that Lim was clearly recounting his encounter with a plainclothes Chinese policeman inside Club Envy, which logically, was the victim.

41     Lim had contended that this statement was inaccurately recorded and claimed that he had “_mashed up_” his experiences in Club Viva and Club Envy together because he had suffered a severe hangover at the time the statement was taken, i.e. 12 November 2017 at 1.22pm. It was the Prosecution’s case that this was without merit for three reasons:

> (a)     Lim’s Counsel had not put to PW1 that his statement in Exhibit P8 was inaccurately recorded, or that he was belabouring under a severe hangover that rendered his statement inaccurate. Lim’s flippant explanation that he did not challenge its inaccuracy because it is “not much of an issue” precisely revealed that he is lying about its inaccuracy. Thus, the accuracy in the recording of Exhibit P8 remained unchallenged;

> (b)     It did not make sense for Lim to have ‘mashed up’ his account of both Club Viva and Club Envy when Lim clearly demarcated his experience in Club Viva and Club Envy respectively by stating “We partied at Club Viva till past midnight and then made our way to Club Envy. We were parting happily till I realised that there is a raid.” Thus, it logically followed that whatever he was recounting after that line is in relation to Club Envy;

> (c)     Lim’s confused and ludicrous answers in clarifying which part of his statement referred to Club Envy and Club Viva respectively showed that this claim was a lie. It was submitted that Lim knew that the victim was a police officer at the material time and is desperately attempting to distance himself from the incriminating portion with respect to this issue in Exhibit P8.

42     Leong had similarly claimed that she did not know that the victim was a police officer. She explained that she was unaware of his identity or what he had worn when she first stood perpendicular to him. When asked to clarify on what she had meant in her Question 6 and Answer 6 in her s 22 CPC statement in _Exhibit P13_, she said that when she first approached the victim, he was perpendicular to her and she did not take notice of his lanyard. Furthermore, it was dark in that corner and he was not facing her. She only noticed his police lanyard when she stepped beside him a second time towards the end of the scuffle and when she heard him call for an arrest.

43     It was the Prosecution’s case that Leong’s explanation in Question 6 and Answer 6 in _Exhibit P13_ was against the weight of the objective evidence in _Exhibit P7_. It could clearly be seen from _Exhibit P7_ at 4:10:00 am to 4:10:11 am that the victim was speaking to Lim and his body was facing the accused persons’ group. At 4:10:11 am, when Lim threw the first punch at the victim’s face, Leong could be seen stepping towards the victim’s direction from his right and going towards him. There was no moment in the CCTV footage that showed Leong stepping towards the victim a second time. In fact, the evidence showed that Leong had forcefully grabbed the victim’s neck with her arm the moment she had stepped towards him and after Lim had thrown the first punch. She did not let go of the victim’s neck until PW4 and one of the club’s bouncers came to separate her.

44     It was submitted that Leong was also trying to give a contrived explanation and distance herself from _Exhibit P13_. It was highlighted that Leong did not raise any issues of inaccuracy during the recording process of _Exhibit P13_. It was further submitted that Leong did know that the victim was a police officer the moment she first approached and stepped next to him after Lim had thrown the first punch. This is because she had seen his police lanyard which the objective evidence showed was conspicuously hung around his neck.

#### Victim’s identity was made known to the accused persons before and during the assault

45     It was the Prosecution’s case that the victim had made his identity known to the accused persons before and during the assault on him. The victim’s evidence that he had identified himself as a police officer to the accused persons’ group before and during the assault was credible and corroborated by the extrinsic evidence. Second, PW4 had identified himself to Leong that he was a police officer and had informed her that the victim was a fellow police officer as corroborated by PW3’s evidence.

#### PW3 identified himself and the victim as police officers to Leong

46     It was also the Prosecution’s case that Leong knew the victim was a police officer as PW3 had identified himself and the victim as police officers. This was when he saw Leong had her left arm around the victim’s neck area and was facing him. He then ordered her to let go of the victim. Leong responded to PW3 “_this guy…wants to arrest my friend”_. He then told her that they were police officers and to go out of the club to settle the issue.

47     It was submitted that this aspect of evidence on Leong’s response was unchallenged by the Defence. If she truly did not know that the victim was a police officer until after the end of the incident and when the police and bouncers had arrived, this piece of evidence would be damning to her case and she had every opportunity to challenge this issue when PW3 was on the stand. It was further submitted that Leong failed to do so and therefore her denial that she did not know rang hollow. Although she tried to clarify during her re-examination that she said no such thing to PW3 on this issue, her lengthy clarification did not shed any light on why this was not brought up earlier and PW3 did not have the opportunity to respond to her version of events. It was the Prosecution’s case that this was an afterthought.

### B.   Each of the accused persons participated in a criminal act

#### Lim punched the victim at least three times on his face and head

48     It was the Prosecution’s case that there was overwhelming evidence with respect to Lim punching the victim at least three times on his face, particularly, his left temporal region. Lim did not dispute this either and the punches were consistent with the injuries sustained by the victim, and which the victim had testified to the same as well.

49     It was highlighted that the Defence has argued at length that the first punch at 4:10:09 am was actually a gesture from Lim and that the first punch came afterwards. While the Prosecution maintained its stance that the first punch was thrown by Lim at or about that timing, it was contended that even if that were a gesture, it does not detract from the Prosecution’s submission that Lim already knew the victim was a police officer and had punched him at least three times during the incident.

50     The Defence has also urged that an adverse inference be drawn against the victim’s testimony with respect to the exact moment when he was punched by Lim. It was highlighted that there was a discrepancy between the victim’s account before the assault occurred and what is written in the Summary of Facts for the Case for the Prosecution at paragraph 7. It was submitted that this was a minor discrepancy that does not detract from the rest of the victim’s cogent and logical testimony. More importantly, Lim did not deny punching the victim at least three times. The Court was urged to be slow to draw any adverse inference against the victim’s evidence.

#### Goh punched the victim at least once on his face

51     It was the Prosecution’s case that Goh’s act of punching the victim’s face at least once was substantiated by the testimonies of the victim, PW3 and PW5. The victim had testified that after Lim had punched him, he initially saw Goh trying to stop the fight and pull Lim away from hitting him. However, he saw Goh then joined in and punched him on the left side of his head one time and he felt pain after the punch. It was submitted that their evidence ought to be preferred over that of Goh’s uncorroborated bare denial.

52     It was submitted that the victim’s testimony was not only coherent and logical, it was also candid as he testified that Goh was initially trying to stop Lim from attacking him. This showed that the victim was not a biased witness who was all out to falsely implicate the accused persons. He had given his evidence in a measured and disinterested manner, and to the best of his knowledge and memory.

53     The Defence has alleged that the victim could have mistaken Goh’s act of pushing Lim and the victim away with that of punching. The reason for this mistaken observation was because Lim had punched away the victim’s spectacles before Goh and Leong came into the picture. It was elicited during cross-examination that the victim had a degree of 350 for both eyes and therefore there was a possibility that his identification of Goh punching him was impaired. Despite this, the victim maintained his evidence that he positively identified Goh as one of his assailants because he had seen him after he felt something hit his head and when he turned to Goh’s position, he could clearly see his face and his act of throwing the punch as he was very near to him. It was the Prosecution’s case that the victim’s identification evidence of Goh punching him remains unshaken.

54     It was submitted that Goh’s assault on the victim was witnessed by PW5 who saw overhead punches from both Goh and Lim being targeted at the victim’s head as he approached the scuffle. PW5 had also observed that both Lim and Goh were very aggressive. Furthermore, immediately after the assault when the accused persons were arrested and PW5 had requested a report from the victim as to what had happened, the victim had informed him that both Lim and Goh had punched him.

55     Finally, the victim had informed Dr Piyaratne Hathurusinghage Samudaya Bandara that two persons had assaulted him during the arrest of these people at about 5.00am on 12 November 2017 at St James Power Station and that he was assaulted multiple times by their fists to the left side of his face and left temporal area (_Exhibit PS1_). This was reduced in writing by Dr Savan K. de Silva in _Exhibit P15_.

56     It was the Prosecution’s case that the victim’s testimony of being assaulted by Goh was not only internally consistent, but also corroborated by extrinsic evidence. In contrast, Goh’ denial that he had punched the victim was uncorroborated. Neither the accused persons, nor his friends, DW4 and DW5 could testify to the fact that Goh did not punch the victim because no one paid any attention to Goh.

57     It was highlighted that while the Defence may contend that it was odd for Goh to suddenly attack the victim when he was initially trying to stop Lim from attacking him, this was not for the Prosecution to prove. It was the Prosecution’s case that their burden has been discharged in showing that the victim was indeed punched by Goh and this was corroborated by two other eyewitnesses who witnessed the attack from different angles. In any event, this sudden change of heart by Goh to apparently switch from stopping the fight to assaulting the victim did not affect the operation of the element of common intention, as common intention can be formed on the spot. It was submitted that the Prosecution’s evidence ought to be preferred over Goh’s evidence in finding that he did indeed punch the victim at least once.

#### Leong grabbed the victim’s neck forcefully with either one or both her arms and pulled it

58     It was the Prosecution’s case that Leong’s act of grabbing the victim’s neck forcefully with either one of her arms and pulling it as if placing him in a neck lock was vividly described by not only the victim but also by two other witnesses, namely PW3 and PW4. The victim had testified that when he was holding onto the shirts of Lim and Goh, he felt Leong grab his neck by wrapping the length of her right arm over the front of his neck while she was standing to his right and facing the back of his head. She had exerted a strong force that caused him to feel “_suffocating_”. While doing this act, Leong told the accused persons’ group to run and said so while facing the group’s direction.

59     When PW4 came to his aid, Leong still had her arm around his neck, and he told PW4 to get her off him. He also testified that at this point PW4 had identified that both the victim and PW4 were from the police to Leong and told her to let go but she did not comply. PW4 then tried to pull Leong’s hand off the victim’s neck but he was unsuccessful. PW4 once again identified himself as a police officer but Leong still did not release her grip on him. Leong only let go of him when other officers and bouncers came to pull her away. It was submitted that once again, the victim’s evidence was internally consistent and credible. In addition, his account was made more credible because Leong’s criminal act of essentially putting the victim in a neck lock was witnessed by PW3 and PW4.

60     PW3 had testified that he saw Leong holding onto the victim’s neck in a neck lock with and this caused the victim to not being able to move and resist her in order to get to Lim. PW3 elaborated that one of her arms was around the victim’s neck while the other was grabbing onto his body. He then tried to force Leong to release her grip on the victim but could not and thus he called PW4 for help. It was submitted that PW3’s testimony was on all fours with how the victim had described Leong’s neck lock on him.

61     PW4 had testified that he saw Leong wrapped her whole arm around the back of the victim’s shoulder but _was unable to see the front of Sgt Tan’s body_ as it was covered by the latter’s body and PW4 was standing behind the victim. PW4 further testified that he identified himself to Leong as a police officer and tried to pull her arm away from the victim’s neck but was unsuccessful. It was submitted that his testimony substantially corroborates the victim’s and PW3’s testimony.

62     It was highlighted that Leong denied the above and had asserted the following: she lightly tapped on the victim’s shoulder to ask him to stop fighting with Lim and to calm him down. However, as the victim charged forward towards Lim, her first reaction was to pull him backwards and she therefore grabbed harder on his shoulder area so that he will not move forward. Subsequently, with all the pushing, she lost her balance and fell down on the floor. Leong also alleged that after she got up, she was still holding onto the victim. The victim then elbowed her, causing her to fall to the floor a second time and that he had stepped on her hair and could not get up until DW5 helped her up. That was when she heard the victim call for an arrest and that she knew at that point that the victim was a police officer.

63     It was the Prosecution’s case that Leong had lied about her criminal act for the following three reasons:

> (a)     Leong’s alleged act of putting her hand on the victim’s shoulder to calm him down was not witnesses by any one of the accused persons or defence witnesses. Again, this was uncorroborated evidence;

> (b)     Even if what Leong had testified were true, it would not have made sense for her to continue holding on to the victim’s shoulder with her hand if he were to surge forward and make her lose her balance, and still holding onto his shoulder even after she had fallen. Leong had conceded under cross-examination that she lost her balance because she was “dragged along” by the victim’s force as he surged forward, ostensibly towards Lim. If she had merely placed her hand on the victim’s shoulder, it would have been easier to hold her balance and/or let go so as not to fall. It was submitted that the only reasonable explanation why Leong had been dragged along by the victim’s force, which caused her to lose her balance, and thereafter to still hold onto the victim after she had fallen was because she was desperately clinging onto his neck with at least one of her arms grabbing his neck forcefully from the front. The laws of physics apply very simply to this issue, but her version attempts to obfuscate this.

> (c)     Leong’s version at trial was also inconsistent with her version in her s 22 CPC statement in Exhibit P13. Leong had merely mentioned in Question 2 Answer 2 that she had put her hand on the victim’s shoulders to ask him to stop and then tightened her grip and it might have caused him to be over his neck. While Leong had tried to proffer an explanation to this, it was submitted that it was a feeble attempt to explain this discrepancy by alluding to it being a messy brawl and that she was trying to give the benefit of doubt that her hand might have come into contact with the victim’s neck. It was further submitted that she was clearly trying to distance herself from her statement by maintaining her version on the stand that she did not come into contact with the victim’s neck at all.

64     The Prosecution urged the Court to find that the totality of the evidence points to Leong having forcefully grabbed and pulled the victim’s neck with one of her arms.

### C.   The common intention of the accused persons to voluntarily cause hurt to the victim in order to prevent him from arresting Lim can be inferred from the surrounding circumstances

65     It was submitted that the next element would be whether there was a common intention of the accused persons to voluntarily cause hurt to the victim in order to prevent him from arresting Lim. It was the Prosecution’s case that the surrounding circumstances ought to enable this Court to infer that there was such a common intention between the accused persons.

66     In relation to Lim, it was submitted that while facing the victim and having an unblocked view of his police lanyard, Lim had started the assault by throwing the first punch at the victim. Lim had continued to assault the victim even after he had identified himself as a police officer and had held onto his shirt collar as he tried to effect an arrest. Lim had stated in his examination-in-chief that he punched the victim because the latter had grabbed onto him and he wanted to break free. It was submitted that the irresistible inference of this was that Lim punched the victim in order for the latter to release his grip on him and prevent the accused from arresting him.

67     In relation to Goh, PW3 had testified that Goh was seen trying to stop the victim from arresting Lim by pushing the victim away. PW4 had testified that Goh and Lim were throwing overhead punches at the victim’s head. It was undisputed that Goh knew the victim was a police officer and that he was standing just next to or around Lim at all material times during the scuffle and he therefore was aware of what Lim was doing when he was assaulting the victim. It was the Prosecution’s case that it was unbelievable that Goh did not know the victim would have been trying to arrest Lim at that point since he knew that the victim was a police officer and had seen Lim punch the victim. Putting these strands of evidence together, it was submitted that Goh formed the same common intention with Lim on the spot to cause hurt to the victim in order to prevent him from arresting Lim. This was after he tried and failed to pull Lim away from the victim who was arresting him.

68     In relation to Leong, it was submitted that the victim, PW3 and PW4 had testified that she had one of her arms around the victim’s neck and had forcefully grabbed and pulled it. In particular, this came only after the victim was punched by Lim and he had grabbed onto both Lim and Goh’ shirt collars. It was further submitted that Leong knew that the victim was a police officer when she stepped next to him and saw his police lanyard. This was before she placed him in a neck lock. While placing the victim’s neck in a neck lock, he had heard her call out to her friends to run. They had all testified that Leong did not let go of the victim’s neck even after their identity as police officers was brought to her attention. PW4’s testimony that Leong had told him that the victim was trying to arrest her friend, i.e. Lim, in response to his demand to let go of the victim was unchallenged.

69     It was the Prosecution’s case that pulling the strands of evidence together for Leong, she knew after Lim had thrown the first punch at the victim that Lim was in trouble with the law as he had punched a police officer. Hence, forming the same common intention on the spot, she forcefully grabbed the victim’s neck and pulled it to overpower and restrain him and prevent him from arresting Lim while Lim and Goh rained punches on the victim.

#### The victim never displayed any belligerence or unprofessionalism in the discharge of his duty as a police officer

70     It was highlighted that the thrust of the accused persons’ defence to the common intention element was that the victim did not identify himself as a police officer and this was compounded by the fact that he had behaved like a hooligan towards Lim. Thus, Lim had tried to protect himself against the victim’s alleged pugnaciousness by pre-emptively striking him, while Goh and Leong were trying to stop the fight between Lim and the victim. None thought that the accused was effecting an arrest. It was the Prosecution’s case that their defence was spurious and unfairly casted aspersions on the victim. Consequently, the only explanation that this Court should find why the victim was so senselessly attacked that day was because all three accused persons shared the common intention to cause hurt to the victim in order to prevent him from arresting Lim.

71     It was the Prosecution’s case that the Defence’s claims were baseless and unfairly cast aspersions on the victim. It was submitted that the allegation that the victim had intentionally or otherwise, bumped into Lim was a lie as this was not supported by a viewing of the CCTV footage and Lim had conceded as much in his cross-examination. No one in the accused persons’ group saw the bump even though they were standing near Lim as no one testified to the contrary. Lim’s ridiculous and incoherent explanation about whether he knew it was the victim who had bumped into him and whether it was an intentional bump betrayed his bogus attempt to concoct an excuse for his belligerent behaviour towards the victim.

72     It was submitted that the allegation that the victim had uttered any vulgarity was also a lie. No one, save for DW4 heard the victim utter vulgarities at Lim. It was further submitted that DW4’s testimony must be treated with caution and he was an interested witness, since he is the accused persons’ friend. Furthermore, it was curious that when the victim was cross-examined, it was put to him that during the first interaction between himself and the accused persons’ group, he allegedly said “_if you are not involved \[in the fight\], fuck off”_. However, when both Leong and Goh were questioned as to whether they actually heard the victim say that in order for Counsel for both accused persons to put to the victim this point, they both denied having heard this. It was the Prosecution’s case that it appears this put question by the accused persons to assist Lim’s lie. It was submitted that there was simply no basis for this put question, and it was precisely so because the victim never uttered any vulgarity to Lim.

73     It was submitted that if Lim had claimed that such appalling behaviour from a police officer had left a deep impression on him such as uttering vulgarities, charging belligerently towards him and making him fearful that he was about to be attacked, it was odd that Lim had failed to mention these important and significant facts in his police statements, _Exhibit P8_ and _Exhibit P9_. These statements were taken just within a day after the incident, and there was no challenge to its accuracy. Neither Lim nor any of the accused persons also lodged any official complaint against the victim.

74     It was the Prosecution’s case that there was simply no basis put forth by the accused persons to show that the victim was acting unprofessionally and aggressively. Even if his method of arrest were questionable, s 99(1) of the Penal Code applies to all the accused persons and especially to Lim—the mere fact that the victim’s method of arrest is not justifiable by law was irrelevant. Lim, and for that matter the other accused persons, have no right to private defence against the victim’s actions. He had demonstrated good faith under the colour of his office (he did not intentionally pick on the accused persons’ group and only focussed his attention on them when was of the view that a s 6(3) POHA offence was committed by Lim); and he did not do an act which reasonably causes the apprehension of death or grievous hurt towards Lim. Therefore, it was submitted that the foundation for which the accused persons hang their defence against the common intention element, which is to allege improper conduct by the victim and thereby justify their respective actions against him, has fallen miserably. What the evidence in fact showed was this was an unprovoked attack by the accused persons on a public servant who was merely carrying out his duty in a professional manner.

### D   Lim had used abusive words towards the victim in relation to the execution of his duty as a public servant

75     It was the Prosecution’s case that Lim did not deny uttering the abusive words “fuck you, chee bye” to the victim at about 4.10am on 12 November 2017. This was also heard by PW3 and even the accused’s friend DW4. The issue in dispute was whether he had uttered those words to the victim in relation to the execution of his duty as a public servant, i.e. a police officer. Based on the foregoing, it was submitted that Lim knew that the victim was a police officer the moment they first engaged each other 4:09:44 to 4:09:49 am. At that point, Lim was tipsy and he lashed out at the victim in response to his request to leave the club. The Prosecution could only surmise that Lim was unhappy that the revelry had ended abruptly as a result of the fight on the dance floor and his unhappiness was exacerbated by the influence of alcohol.

76     It was submitted that the Prosecution had proven its case against the three accused persons beyond a reasonable doubt. During the course of the trial, Prosecution had provided clear evidence of the _actus reus_ and _mens rea_ of the various offences committed by the accused persons. Their Defence was without merit and ought to be rejected. In the circumstances, the Prosecution had urged the Court to find the accused persons guilty as charged.

## The Defence’s Case

77     Five witnesses including the three accused persons had given evidence as part of the Defence’s case. The two additional defence witnesses were Mervyn Lee Wei Lun (“DW4”) and Yiap Chun Kang (“DW5”).

### Lim’s Defence

78     As part of his defence, Lim did not dispute the fact that he had assaulted the victim. However, it was the Defence’s case that Lim did not have the requisite _mens rea_ to constitute the offence in question, namely, Lim did not know that the victim was a public servant going about his duties.

79     According to Lim, he felt someone bumping into him as he and his group of friends were approaching the table situated near the exit of Club Envy. Eager for an explanation, Lim had called out to the victim who was believed to be responsible for the bump and eventually hurled vulgarities at the latter. In reply, the victim had simply told Lim to _“fuck off”_. Frustrated and offended, Lim had responded by throwing a wild gesture and hurling vulgarities at the victim. According to Lim, the victim then charged or lunged at Lim and told him to _“shut the fuck up”_. Lim had perceived the victim’s approach as a threat to his safety, and pre-emptively attacked the victim.

80     It was Lim’s defence’s case that he had no knowledge of the victim’s identity as a police officer as he did not, at the material time, identify himself as a police officer nor would an ordinary person have knowledge of his identity in the circumstances. It was the Defence’s case that the victim’s behaviour was aggressive and wholly inconsistent with that which was to be expected of a police officer. The victim’s behaviour led Lim to think that he was a patron looking for trouble. B3 did not have any reason to think that PW6 was a public servant going about his duties.

### Applicable Law under s 332 Penal Code

81     The elements for an offence of voluntarily causing hurt to a public servant in the discharge of his duty under s 332 of the Penal Code are:

> (a)     Voluntarily causing hurt to public servant in discharge of duty;

> (b)     Intention to prevent a public servant from discharging his duty.

It was submitted that the knowledge required to constitute a charge under s 332 of the Penal Code would depend on how the charge is framed. It is based on an objective standard and not a subjective one.

82     Citing _Khor Ah Kah_ v _PP_ <span class="citation">\[1964\] MLJ 309</span> and _R_ v _Inwood_ <span class="citation">\[1973\] 1 WLR 647</span>, it was the Defence’s case that two clear propositions emerge from these cases namely:

> (a)     depending on how the charge is framed, the Prosecution will need to prove the existence of an intention to prevent the public servant from discharging his duty; and

> (b)     there is no offence under s 332 of the Penal Code if a person causes hurt to a police officer who exceeds his authority or otherwise resists an illegal or unjustifiable arrest.

### Elements of a common intention offence

83     It was the Defence’s case that the elements of a common intention offence are set out in _Daniel Vijay s/o Katherasan_ v _PP_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 4 SLR 1119</span>. Three elements must be present before constructive liability can be imposed pursuant to Section 34 of the Penal Code, namely:

> (a)     the criminal act element;

> (b)     the common intention element and

> (c)     the participation element.

#### Criminal Act

84     It was submitted that “_A criminal act”_ refers to the aggregate of all the diverse acts done by the actual doer and secondary offenders which collectively gives rise to the offence that they have been charged with. The acts committed by the different parties in the criminal action may be different, but all must in one way or another participate or engage in the criminal enterprise. The criminal act done by the actual doer must give rise to the offence which the secondary offenders are charged with.

#### Common Intention of All

85     It was further submitted that the criminal act done by the actual doer which results in the offence charged would be considered to be done in furtherance of the common intention of all the offenders only if that common intention includes an intention to commit the very criminal act done by the actual doer. There must be a common intention to do something or achieve a purpose. The crucial question in every case is to first identify the common intention. The existence (or otherwise) of such a common intention must frequently be inferred from the offenders’ conduct and all the relevant circumstances of the case.

#### Participation

86     It was highlighted that in _Lee Chez Kee_ v _PP_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 3 SLR(R) 447</span>, the Court of Appeal clarified that participation, not presence, is they key ingredient in imposing liability under s 34 of the Penal Code and that this is a question of fact to be decided in each case. An offender will satisfy the requirement of participation if he participates in the specific criminal act which gives rise to the offence charged or if he participates in some other criminal act that is done in furtherance of the common intention of all offenders (_ie_, if the offender participates in any of the diverse acts which together form the unity of criminal behaviour resulting in the offence charged, that unity of criminal behaviour being commonly intended by all the offenders).

87     It was also crucial to note that the mere presence of an accused person does not constitute participation. As stated above, it should be a question of fact whether the offender had participated to a sufficient degree to be deemed as blameworthy as the principal offender.

### Issues to be determined

88     It was the Defence’s case that the three main issues to be determined by the Court were:

> (a)     whether Lim knew at the material time that the victim was a public servant (or police officer);

> (b)     whether Lim had the intention to prevent the victim from discharging his duties; and

> (c)     whether there was a common intention between Leong, Goh and Lim to cause hurt to the victim.

#### The victim’s evidence

89     It was the Defence’s case that under cross-examination, the victim proved to be an evasive witness. He would take long pauses to answer the simplest of questions. He would also refuse to answer questions directly when he knew that his answers would reveal the impropriety in his conduct at the time. When confronted with questions regarding the objective evidence in _Exhibit P7_, he resorted to prevarication. Essentially, he did everything he could to cast himself as an upstanding police officer who was the innocent victim of a senseless attack, even though _Exhibit P7_ painted a wholly different picture.

90     It was submitted that the victim came across as a little too self-important, an officer who did not behave properly (who allowed his ego to get in the way of his public duty), and who has now implausibly embellished his version of events to deflect attention from his shortcomings. It was further submitted that the victim had made up his evidence for approaching the group. On one hand, he had claimed that he suspected the group was involved in the reported fight because they were coming from the direction of the dance floor. On the other hand, he saw fit to tell the group to leave the club without taking any steps to confirm his suspicion. When asked if it was appropriate for him to allow the group to leave in the circumstances, the victim had replied nonchalantly that that was how he responded _“there and then”_ and that he _“didn’t think too much about it”_.

91     It was highlighted that according to the victim, the reason why he directed the group to leave was because he did not want the group to turn around and return to the dance floor to _“sandwich”_ his fellow officers or to cause _“complications or possible injuries”_ to them. It was submitted that if the victim truly did suspect the group, he would not have simply allowed them to leave the club without questioning them. From his answers, it seems that the victim’s attention was on the incident and not on the group’s involvement therein. It was clear that the victim evidence was embellished for the purpose of suppressing the actual reasons that led to the scuffle.

92     It was submitted that at trial, the victim attempted to pull a rabbit out of the hat by alleging that Lim had used the words _“fuck you chee bye police”_. It was pointed out that this version was not in any way corroborated by PW3 or PW2, who were both present at the time. Secondly and most importantly, the said words are not reflected anywhere in the second charge that Lim faces under s 6(1)(a) of the POHA. It was the Defence’s case that the inexorable inference in the circumstances was that the victim had embellished his evidence in this regard to give the impression that Lim was aware of his identity as a police officer all along.

93     It was the Defence’s case that the movement on Lim’s part at timestamp 04:10:09 am in _Exhibit P7_ was a gesture and not a punch. There was no impact on the victim namely, no visible backward movement or jerk of his head after the alleged punch by Lim. It was submitted that the victim’s only reaction thereupon was his _“abrupt”_ movement towards Lim; there was no reaction from him consistent with his allegation that he was punched then.

94     It was highlighted that there was a material inconsistency in the victim’s evidence relating to the sequence of events that took place at the material time. It was submitted that the sequence of events in the Prosecution’s Summary of Facts differed vastly from the version that the Prosecution put forth at trial. It was further submitted that in light discrepancy that it was appropriate draw an adverse inference pursuant to s 169(1)(c) CPC against the victim’s evidence that Lim had punched him at 04:10:09 am, before he tried to restrain Lim.

95     It was submitted that the victim’s evidence on the manner of his purported arrest was just as incredible. When first questioned, the victim came out in typical blunderbuss fashion, alleging that he tried to _“pull_ \[Lim\] _down”_. When he realised that he had actually done the opposite, he proceeded to change his evidence by saying _“rather push him to restrain him”_. It was highlighted that between timestamps 04:10:09 am and 04:10:11 am in _Exhibit P7_, none of these pulling or pushing actions can be seen. It was the Defence’s case that instead, what was seen was the victim lunging or charging towards Lim in a one quick and decisive movement with his chest coming into contact with Lim first, a fact which the victim strenuously had denied before finally saying that he _“can’t recall”_.

#### PW3’s evidence

96     It was the Defence’s case that as PW3 was the only other witness for the Prosecution that might have been privy to the exchange(s) between the victim and the group prior to the scuffle, his role was material. It was submitted that his evidence was far from reliable. His version of the facts was littered with embellishments that were unnecessary and themselves inconsistent with the Prosecution’s case, deliberately designed to paint the accused persons (namely, Leong) in the worst possible light.

97     For instance, PW3 claimed that he broke away from the scuffle to procure PW4’s assistance because he was not able to remove Leong’s grip on the victim. When confronted with the truth in _Exhibit P7_, however, he was unable to identify the point at which he had done so, giving only a poor excuse that his actions was not captured in the CCTV footage. In light of the above, the Court was urged to give limited weight to PW3’s evidence.

#### Evidence PW4 and PW5

98     It was highlighted the evidence of PW4 and PW5 were not material vis-à-vis the Prosecution’s case against Lim. It was not disputed that Lim punched the victim at least three times. It was submitted that the evidence of these witnesses was flawed and somewhat embellished. PW5 was unable to recognize mugshots of Leong, Goh and Lim as the incident occurred _“some time back”_. In his evidence, he testified that he heard PW6 shouting _inter alia_ the word _“mata”_ when PW6 himself made no such averment. It was further submitted that PW5 did agree that the punches he saw as he was approaching the group was before he allegedly heard PW6 shouting _“mata”_.

99     It was the Defence’s case that PW4’s evidence was no better. When _Exhibit P7_ was played back to him, PW4 had claimed that the movement at timestamp 04:10:43 am was Lim _“stealing punches”_ towards the victim’s head. He went on to say that he recalled seeing only one punch but that he believes that there was more than one punch. During cross-examination, PW4 explained that he recalls Lim punch landing _“on top of_ \[PW6’s\] _head”_. It was submitted that when he took a second look at the CCTV, he had no choice but to agree that the movement that he earlier identified as the punch was unlikely to have been the punch that landed on the head of the victim.

100    It was further submitted that in stark contrast with his colleagues, PW2 testified honestly. To the best of his recollection, he saw the victim having a _“consensual conversation”_ with the group but did not hear the conversation that they were having. He did not think much about it and his attention was on the fight that was taking place in the main arena of the club. He confirmed, however, that he did not hear the victim identifying himself as a police officer to the group when he was at the table.

### A   Lim did not at the material time know that the victim was a public servant (or a police officer)

101    It was submitted that on the terms of the charge, the Prosecution would need to show that Lim had knowledge of the victim’s identity **before the point** at which he had caused hurt to the victim. Accordingly, any knowledge of the victim’s identity formed **during** the hurt is insufficient for the purposes of this inquiry. It was further submitted that knowledge cannot be imputed on Lim in the circumstances:

> (a)     The victim’s evidence on the point of his identification was entirely uncorroborated, and in fact disputed by the majority of the witnesses for the Defence;

> (b)     The Defence’s version of the events for the reasons contained under the victim’s evidence and

> (c)     An ordinary person would not otherwise have had knowledge of the victim’s identity in the circumstances of the case.

102    It was further submitted that it was the Prosecution’s case that the victim had orally identified himself as a police officer between timestamps 04:09:45 am and 04:09:49 am in _Exhibit P7_, when he allegedly approached the group and asked them to leave the club. Notably, the other witnesses for the Prosecution have provided no corroboration on this point. It was highlighted that when asked if he made any effort to direct the group’s attention to the warrant card that he was wearing (an act which he could have easily done), the victim remained evasive, claiming ultimately that he could not recall.

103    It was the Defence’s case that with the exception of Goh, the Defence’s witnesses have all testified that they were, for their own reasons, unaware of the victim’s identity before the scuffle. The evidence of Leong, Lim and DW4 was consistent in that the victim did not identify himself as a police officer to the group at the material time. DW5, however, was not focused on the interaction between the victim and the group.

104    It was submitted that the only witness who had knowledge of the victim’s identity was Goh. As he explained, this was because he took notice of the victim’s presence during his prior interaction with a police officer at Club Viva. It was the Defence’s case that Goh’s knowledge could not be imputed onto Lim. In any event, Goh had testified that he did not hear anything in the conversation between the victim and Lim at the material time.

105    It was further submitted that an ordinary person would not have had knowledge of the victim’s identity in the circumstances of the case. Firstly, it was undisputed that the victim was dressed in plain clothes. Secondly, in the victim’s own words, the situation in the club was _“very noisy and very chaotic”_, with _“pockets of fights”_ taking place at the same time. While the Defence accepted that the victim was wearing his police lanyard with his warrant card, that by itself cannot automatically mean that an ordinary person would have the knowledge that the victim was a police officer.

106    It was submitted that lanyards are an accessory that is commonly worn by patrons and brand promoters in nightlife venues for a myriad of purposes – to carry their mobile phones, to identify themselves as brand promoters. Without more, such as an overt act of identification, one can and should not be treated as having knowledge of the contents of the lanyard. This is especially so in the context of a nightspot venue, where lighting conditions are invariably poor. For these reasons, it was further submitted that the wearing of a police lanyard could not without more, be sufficient to impute knowledge on Lim in the circumstances.

107    It was the Defence’s case that besides allegedly identifying himself when he first approached the group (which is denied), the victim did not perform any overt action to direct the group’s attention to the warrant card that he was wearing around his neck. When asked to confirm this, the victim proffered that it was visible to the group until eventually falling back on his safety net, that he _“can’t recall”_.

108    It was submitted that the victim had testified shouting that he was from the police during the scuffle, yet none of the witnesses were able to corroborate this point. While PW3 did say that after PW4 came into the picture, he _“kept shouting, “Let go of my officers…”_ it was highlighted that PW4 himself testified that he had only entered the club after the scuffle. It was not disputed that the situation was noisy and chaotic, especially for those who were directly involved in the scuffle. Assuming that the victim had identified himself as police officer during the scuffle (which was denied), it would not be unreasonable to suggest that Lim did not hear him. Lim did come to know of the victim’s identity as a police officer. However, this knowledge came too late in the day after the hurt had already been caused.

### B   Lim had no intention to prevent the victim from discharging his duties

109    It was the Defence’s case that in addition to knowledge, the Prosecution must prove that the hurt was caused by Lim to the victim with an intention of preventing him from discharging his duty. If this intention does not exist, it followed that the charge in DAC-940613-2017 must necessarily fail. It was submitted that the available evidence did not point to the conclusion that the victim was executing his duties as a public servant at the material time. His Counsel questioned the victim’s behaviour towards a suspect that did not seem like he was about to bolt and run or resist arrest. It was submitted that this was clearly not a situation where Lim had caused hurt to the victim as the latter was engaged in conducting his operations at Club Envy. It was further submitted that the assault only started after the victim had charged at Lim.

110    It was argued that the victim’s actions at the material time could not be characterised as an execution of duty. It was highlighted that all the Defence’s witnesses have agreed that the victim’s behaviour or body language was aggressive at the material time – the victim had his chest stuck out towards Lim during their interactions at the table, after Lim called out to him. It was submitted that DW5’s evidence, although not directly corroborative of the foregoing, suggests that the victim’s behaviour was akin to that of a troublemaker because of the obstruction that he was causing to the group as they were about to leave the club.

111    It was the Defence’s case that the victim’s body language was best described by DW4 that he appeared very _“agitated”_ and _“aggressive”_ and had even pointed at Lim in the face asking him to _“shut the fuck up”_. It was submitted that on the evidence, it was clear that the victim had lunged or charged towards Lim between timestamps 04:10:09 am and 04:10:11 am in _Exhibit P7_.

112    It was further submitted that on a proper construction of s 75 of the CPC, police officers are required to _“touch or confine”_ the body of the person to be arrested unless he submits to arrest by word or action. It is only if a person forcibly resists or tries to evade arrest that a police officer may use other reasonable means to make the arrest.

113    In this regard, the Defence’s case was that the actions of the victim between timestamps 04:10:09 am and 04:10:11 am did not amount to an arrest in the mind of Lim but was in fact the victim’s attempt to challenge or taunt Lim in response to his dissatisfaction with Lim’s earlier gestures and comments. It was highlighted that in his evidence, the victim had claimed that he informed Lim that he was going to arrest him but was not able to recall if this was done at timestamp.

114    It was submitted that in the circumstances, there was no shred of evidence to suggest that Lim understood that he was being arrested at the material time. It was further submitted that there was no way that Lim could have reasonably understood as such. Lim had merely responded naturally to his aggressor, whom he did not know was a public servant or for that matter, one who was discharging public duties. In his mind, as well as the mind of the other members of his group (save for Goh), the accused seemed like a regular patron who was out to look for trouble.

115    Most importantly, the victim for reasons best known to him, chose to carry out his purported arrest in a manner that falls below the standard that is required of him. Instead of using words (which he could have), he chose to charge at Lim’s chest first in an aggressive manner. There was no attempt by the victim to touch or confine Lim’s body and there was no attempt to communicate to Lim the fact that he was being arrested. If the victim was not in fact effecting a lawful arrest, his own actions may well constitute an assault on Lim.

116    For these reasons, it was the Defence’s case that Lim did not have the intention to prevent the victim from discharging his duties and was not in fact discharging his duties at the material time. Thus, Lim’s assault on the victim was not one that was carried out against a public servant in discharge of duty but rather, his natural response (albeit an admittedly poor one) to an aggressor whom he suspected was about to cause him hurt.

### C   There was no common intention amongst Leong, Goh and Lim to cause hurt to the victim

117    It was submitted that the Prosecution’s case was that the three accused persons had shared a common intention to cause hurt to the victim. At trial, the Prosecution’s case was that Leong and Goh had intended to help Lim evade arrest or prevent the victim arresting Lim. As against Goh, it was put to him that he assaulted the victim to help Lim avoid being arrested by the victim. As against Leong, it was put to her that she had done what she did because she wanted to prevent the victim from arresting Lim. It was the Defence’s case that this was not borne out on the evidence. Leong and Goh had both testified as to their own intentions at the material time. It was submitted that the actions of Leong and Goh were guided by motivations that were vastly different from Lim.

118    It was submitted that this intention (even if formed, which was denied) was not by itself sufficient to sustain the charges, as it was not an intention to commit the very criminal act done by Lim. The common intention that was required in the circumstances was one that was to cause hurt to the victim to prevent him from discharging his duties, as opposed to **simply allowing Lim** to cause hurt to the victim to prevent him from discharging his duties.

119    It was the Defence’s case that s 332 of the Penal Code does not criminalise attacks against police officers; s 332 of the Penal Code criminalises attacks against police officers **in the execution of their duties**. It was submitted that it does not criminalise attacks against police officers who go beyond their line of duty or take the law into their own hands.

120    It was submitted that while Lim should be punished for causing hurt to the victim, the Prosecution had failed to prove the requisite _mens rea_ to constitute the current s 332 offence. For these reasons, it was unsafe to convict Lim on DAC-940613-2017 and the Court should acquit Lim.

### Goh and Leong’s Defence

#### Goh’s account

121    On the night of 11 November 2017, Goh had met some friends for drinks at Club Viva in St James Power Station. This group of friends included Lim, Leong, DW4 and DW5 who was Lim’s friend. Lim, Goh and DW4 were secondary school friends while Leong is Goh’s colleague.

122    Goh testified that there was a raid at Club Viva and that he and DW4 spoke to two police officers, one of whom was Lim, to let them leave the club so that they could meet their other friends in Club Envy. They were subsequently allowed to leave Club Viva and went to Club Envy.

123    After they were at Club Envy for about an hour, a fight broke out near to their table. Goh and DW4 decided to ask their group to leave the club. Goh recalled seeing the fight just as he came out of the toilet. Their group moved towards the exit in a single file, with DW4 leading the way and Goh and Lim following behind him. Goh gave evidence that their group then started to gather at a table near the exit to wait for the others who were lagging behind.

124    While they were waiting at the table, Goh testified that he noticed that Lim was talking to the victim. Goh did not hear any verbal exchange between Lim and the victim. The first thing he saw was Lim throwing a punch at the victim and the latter’s spectacles flying off. Goh further testified that after being punched by Lim, the victim charged back at Lim and looked like he wanted to hit him.

125    According to Goh, Lim and the victim then started fighting. Goh testified that he initially tried to stop the fight by trying to block Lim’s punches from behind him. However as this was ineffective, Goh got between them to stop the fight by separating them. He further testified that he was initially behind Lim but then moved himself to Lim’s left (which was the police officer’s right) and started blocking Lim’s punches by reaching his right hand across Lim’s body. He was facing the victim when he got between the victim and Lim.

126    Goh testified that the victim then grabbed him by the collar. He further testified that there was a lot of shouting, but he could not make out any words because it was very noisy. He further testified that he himself had shouted “_stop_”. Goh gave evidence that the commotion started to die down after the bouncers and Lim’s colleagues came in. Goh then heard Lim saying that he wanted to “_arrest these 2 guys_” and that the victim pointed at Lim and Goh. Goh testified that did not recall where Leong was during the entire scuffle. Goh was then brought back to the station to assist in investigations.

#### Leong’s account

127    Leong testified that she had met Goh and Lim through DW4 and at the time of the incident, she had only known them for less than a year. Leong further testified that on the night of 11 November 2017, she had some celebratory drinks with some friends, including Lim, Goh, DW4 and DW5 at Club Viva at St James Power Station. At or around 2:00 am, she and DW5 went outside the club to catch up. Leong and DW5 initially intended to go home because they were tired but upon hearing that her friend, Fermelle was at Club Envy, they decided to join them for a while. The group went to Club Envy at or around 2.30 am.

128    She testified that at Club Envy, she had stopped drinking and was catching up with her ex-colleague. During their conversation, a group of people suddenly rushed past her table and she noticed that a fight was about to break out. She further testified that their group mutually agreed to leave the club and walked towards the exit in a single file. She was one of the last few in the line. She and DW5 were left behind for a short while and when they rejoined the group near the exit, she realised that their group had come to a stop at a table.

129    Leong testified that she first noticed the dispute when she saw the victim charging towards Lim. She observed that he looked aggressive and he was charging chest-first towards Lim. According to her, the victim’s body was perpendicular to Leong and so she could only see his profile and side-view. She further testified that she saw that Goh and DW4 were standing close to Lim and so, went over to the victim’s side to stop him from charging forward.

130    She gave evidence that she told the victim who appeared to be aggressive, to calm down and that they were already intending to leave the club so they did not want any trouble. At this point, as Leong was standing on the victim’s right, she put her left hand lightly on his right shoulder. According to Leong, the victim then suddenly lurched forwards and she had intuitively held on to his shoulder.

131    She testified that she lost her balance and fell down twice in the scuffle. The first fall occurred at or around 04:10:19 am when the victim had elbowed her. The second fall occurred at 04:10:24 am. According to her, on the second fall she was lying flat on her back and could not get up because the victim was standing on her hair. She further testified that DW5 helped her up. As she was standing up, she heard the victim call for an arrest and that was when she found out the victim was a police officer.

132    Leong testified that that in her statement in _Exhibit P13_ that she may have touched the victim’s neck in the region near the shoulder although she could not recall exactly. She also testified that when she said in her statement that she noticed the victim was an officer when she “_stepped beside him_”, she was referring to the time at which she stood up from her second fall and the victim was calling for arrest.

#### DW4’s account

133    DW4 testified that on the night of 11 November 2017, he had gone to Club Viva at St James Power Station to celebrate Singles’ Day with Leong, Goh, Lim, Fermelle and their friends. DW4, Lim and Goh were secondary school friends. He further testified that there was a police raid at Club Viva and two police officers had approached DW4. DW4 spoke to the Indian police officer and was very cooperative with the police officer’s instructions. They then proceeded to Club Envy.

134    DW4 gave evidence that at Club Envy, their group were situated near the dance floor. DW4 then went to the toilet with Goh and when they came out, DW4 saw a person holding a small knife in his right arm and looking very agitated. DW4 testified that he then gathered their group and led them towards the exit of the club. Their group then gathered at a table near the exit because someone was missing. They waited for everyone to be present before they exited the club. He further testified that Fermelle, Goh, Lim and Leong had been at their table.

135    DW4 gave evidence that he then noticed Lim talking to the victim. When the victim was walking back to the dance floor after the conversation, DW4 heard Lim shouting some vulgarities at the victim. DW4 testified that the victim had never identified himself as a police officer and that he only found out during the scuffle when he read the fine prints on the victim’s lanyard. DW4 further testified that he then saw the victim get agitated, turned back and charged towards Lim and ask him to “_shut the fuck up_” in his face.

136    DW4 gave evidence that Lim then threw the first punch at the victim and the latter’s spectacles flew off. He further gave evidence that the victim then got even more agitated and wanted to attack Lim back. DW4 testified that he and Goh then tried to hold Lim back. Goh had stood behind Lim and tried to grab around Lim’s upper body from behind while DW4 tried to hold Lim’s arms. DW4 further testified that thereafter, the victim’s colleague who was a petite Malay officer came and joined the group to stop the fight together. DW4 gave evidence that he had asked the Malay officer: “Why is your colleague so agitated?” to which the officer nodded but did not say anything.

137    DW4 testified that he had not noticed Leong during the scuffle but remembered seeing her crying outside the club after the scuffle was over. He also testified that Leong had said that she was mistreated and became very emotional after being handcuffed. He gave evidence that Leong had explained that she had fallen onto the ground, got hit by somebody and hence was mistreated as a lady.

#### DW5’s account

138    DW5 testified that on the night of 11 November 2017, he received a message from Lim asking him to join him and his friends for drinks at St James Power Station. DW5 then met them at Club Viva. DW5 further testified that he is Lim’s university friend and he got to know Goh and Leong through Lim.

139    DW5 gave evidence that he went to Club Envy. He further gave evidence that as a fight had broken out while Lim, Goh, Leong, DW4, DW5 and another lady were in Club Envy, they decided to leave the club as soon as possible. He testified that as their group moved towards the exit, they stopped at a table near the exit to wait for the people to clear out before they could leave. DW5 testified that it was very noisy in the club then. He did not remember exactly how the scuffle happened nor any words that were exchanged but he did remember that everyone suddenly started “_to pull back each other_”.

140    DW5 gave evidence that people started to lose their balance and he was there just trying to help to break up the scuffle by pulling people back together with the members of the group. After the scuffle, DW5 then turned around and noticed Leong on the ground. He went over and helped her up when he extended his hand to grab her hand. According to him, Leong was frightened and was sobbing.

141    DW5 testified that he then went back to the table the group was initially at to get his belongings and he realised their group were not in the club anymore, and when he went out he saw Lim in a police vehicle

### Applicable Law under s 332 Penal Code

142    It was the Defence’s case that the elements of an offence under s 332 of the Penal Code are settled. In _Public Prosecutor v. Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey & anor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1080</span>, the High Court held that (at \[34\]):

> (a)     the _actus reus_ is the causing of hurt; and

> (b)     the _mens rea_ is that the hurt was caused voluntarily with the knowledge that the victim is a public servant going about his duties.

143    In respect of the _mens rea_ element, the Court held that (at \[35\]):

> “Although knowledge that the victim is a public servant going about his duties is not stated explicitly in s 332, it cannot be right that someone who hit another person without even knowing that that person was a public servant going about his duties would be guilty of an offence under s 332. However, the knowledge required is objective and not subjective knowledge. Therefore, if an ordinary person would have such knowledge in the circumstances of the case, it is not open to the accused person to claim that he did not know.”

144    In addition, the intent to prevent or deter a public servant from discharging his duties as such public servant is an essential ingredient of the charge. It was submitted that the Prosecution must also prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused persons intended to prevent the victim was from carrying out his public duty.

145    It was further submitted that the accused persons must also have intended to cause the hurt. In _Public Prosecutor v. Goh Chun Kiat_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGDC 486</span>, the accused person was acquitted of a charge under s 332 of the PC for allegedly twisting the left arm of the officer with his right hand. The Court’s decision turned on the testimonies of the accused person’s parents, who were found to be reliable and forthright. Both testified that the accused person did not voluntarily cause hurt to the officer but that had lost his balance and grabbed hold of the officer’s arm. The Court held that the Prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

### Common Intention

146    It was highlighted that under s 34 of the Penal Code:

> “When a criminal act is done by several persons, in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone.”

147    It was submitted that the law relating to common intention is also trite and set out in _Daniel Vijay s/o Katherasan v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 4 SLR 1119</span>. In order to prove that the accused persons acted with common intention, the Prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that:

> (a)     There was a criminal act;

> (b)     All accused persons shared an intention to carry out the criminal act; and

> (c)     the individual accused person participated in an act which gives rise to the charge.

148    It was further submitted that the Court of Appeal in _Daniel Vijay_ held (at \[65\]) that what must be in the intention of the secondary offender is the very criminal act committed by the principal.

### A   Leong did not cause hurt voluntarily with the knowledge that the victim was a public servant going about his duties.

149    It was the Defence’s case that the Prosecution had failed to prove the charge against Leong beyond a reasonable doubt. Although it is largely undisputed that her hand came into contact with the victim’s shoulder, there was objective and corroborative evidence that suggests that Leong did not know that the victim was a police officer until the scuffle was over and, in any event, had no intention to prevent him from discharging his public duty.

150    It was submitted that Lim, Goh, Leong, DW4 and DW5 had unanimously said that the reason they wanted to leave Club Envy was that they had witnessed a fight at the dance floor and did not want to be involved. From the CCTV footage, their group walked towards the exit in a single file. Leong was one of the last in their group to arrive near the exit. This was borne out by the CCTV footage and DW5’s evidence that he was the last person in the group and right behind Leong. It was the Defence’s case that against this backdrop, Leong was not aware of how the scuffle first started.

### B   Leong did not know that the victim was a police officer.

151    It was submitted that the Court should accept Leong’s evidence that she first noticed the victim only when she saw him charging aggressively towards Lim and therefore did not know that he was an officer. It was further submitted that when their group stopped at a table near the exit, Leong testified that she had been talking to DW5 and was not aware why their group had stopped.

152    It was the Defence’s case that DW5 similarly testified that he, too, did not know why their group had stopped near the exit. Even before the scuffle broke out, DW4 and DW5’s evidence was that the club was still “_very noisy_” and people were still talking and shouting.

153    It was submitted that Leong gave evidence that when she first turned her head to face their group, “my first glimpse at the group was that there was a guy who identified as Sergeant Tan, he looked very aggressive and his chest is outwards, looking like he wants to charge towards Yang Horng”. According to the CCTV footage, Lim gestured at the victim at 04:10:10 am and the victim charged forward. Leong had only noticed the scuffle and moved towards the scuffle at 04:10:12 am.

154    It was further submitted that given that the club was noisy and Leong was talking to DW5 prior to the fight breaking out, it was patently obvious that Leong was not paying attention to Lim and the victim at this juncture. Even if the victim had identified himself as an officer (which is disputed), there was reasonable doubt whether Leong had heard him. It was further submitted that there was doubt that Leong knew that the victim was a police officer allegedly effecting arrest.

155    It was submitted that the victim, PW3 and PW4 had claimed that they identified themselves as officers during the scuffle. It bears reminder that the situation was so chaotic that it was conceivable even if they did (which was disputed), Leong may not have noticed or heard them do so. It was further submitted that this should raise reasonable doubt as to whether Leong knew during the scuffle that the victim was an officer or was effecting arrest.

### C   Leong was trying to stop the fight between Lim and the victim

156    It was the Defence’s case that the evidence showed that Leong was trying to break up a fight. She therefore could not have formed any intention to prevent the victim from effecting arrest. It was submitted that Leong’s evidence was that she told the victim that they were leaving the club and “_did not want any trouble_”.

157    It was further submitted that her evidence was remarkably similar to DW5’s, who was standing closest to Leong. It was the Defence’s case that DW5 was also under the mistaken impression that some other patrons were finding trouble with his group of friends. DW5 testified that, at the time, he thought that the same group who started the fight on the dance floor was blocking their exit.

158    It was the Defence’s case that Goh, Leong, DW4 and DW5 were unanimous in their oral testimonies that they simply wanted to stop the fight. It was submitted that Leong’s interactions with the victim must hence be viewed in this context. It was further submitted that the Court should therefore accept Leong’s evidence that she had perceived that the victim was just another patron of the club was acting aggressively and she was trying to calm him down.

### D.   Leong tightened her grip on the victim because she fell down twice.

159    It was submitted that Leong had admitted that she had put her left hand lightly on the victim’s right shoulder. It was further submitted that the Court should accept her evidence that her grip only tightened when the victim surged forward or when she lost her balance on two occasions. It was the Defence’s case that she did not do so to cause hurt to the victim or prevent him from effecting arrest. This was consistent with the actions of someone trying to stop a fight.

160    It was submitted that the Prosecution’s narrative that Leong was clinging on to the victim did not hold water. PW4 had testified that Leong only released the victim when a bouncer assisted him. However, his evidence was contradicted by DW5’s corroborative evidence and the CCTV footage. The video footage shows that at 4:10:18 am and 04:10:24 am, there were sudden downward movements of the group. Leong gave evidence that these occurred because she had lost her balance. Leong’s evidence was that she let go of the victim because she fell down (on the second occasion) and not because a bouncer had to peel her off the victim. It was the Defence’s case that this was also consistent with DW5’s evidence that “_people were starting to lose their balance_”.

161    It was the Defence’s case that if the Court accepts Leong’s evidence that she only held on to the victim because she lost her balance, the case of _Goh Chun Kiat_ was factually analogous to the present case. In _Goh Chun Kiat_, the accused person merely held on to the officer when he lost his balance and thus, the Court found that the charge against the accused person was not made out. It was submitted that the victim’s account of what Leong was doing during the scuffle should not be given any weight because, by his own evidence, she was standing behind him.

162    It was further submitted that the victim’s evidence did not shed any light on Leong’s intention or state of knowledge. The victim had testified that he heard Leong tell her friends to “_You all hurry up. Run away_”. Indeed, if this was true (which is not admitted), this was evidence that Leong did not know that the victim was an officer. If she had known, it would have been apparent to her that the group would not be able to escape because the group was surrounded by the victim’s colleagues.

### E   Leong’s reaction outside Club Envy.

163    It was the Defence’s case that Leong’s reaction in the immediate aftermath of the scuffle was also relevant in determining her mental state during the fight. Outside the club, DW4 had seen Leong crying and saying that she had been “_mistreated_” and had been “_hit by somebody_” and fallen onto the floor. It was submitted that Leong’s contemporaneous conduct demonstrates that she was frightened and startled by the scuffle. This evidence was irreconcilable with the Prosecution’s narrative of a person who was attacking a police officer. It was further submitted that there was doubt that Leong had the intention to cause hurt to the victim or prevent him from discharging his duties.

### F   Goh did not have knowledge that the victim was a public servant going about his duties

164    It was the Defence’s case that the Prosecution has failed to prove the charge against Goh beyond a reasonable doubt. It was submitted that the charge against Goh was not made out because:

> (a)     Goh did not punch the victim; and

> (b)     Goh did not intend to prevent the victim from discharging his duty as a public servant because he did not know that the victim was discharging such duty.

### G   Goh did not punch the victim

165    It was submitted that the victim’s evidence that Goh had punched him was inherently inconsistent and implausible. According to him, Goh had an inexplicable _volte face_ and decided to punch the victim even though he was initially trying to break up the fight. It was highlighted that the victim had further claimed that Goh had actually punched him several times. In this regard, on the victim’s own evidence, he could be sure of only one alleged punch which he saw directly – the rest were purportedly observed in his periphery.

166    It was further submitted that insofar as the victim’s evidence was based on what he claimed to have _seen_, there was reasonable doubt as to the accuracy of his observations. It was the Defence’s case that not only was the situation highly chaotic, the victim’s evidence was that he saw Goh punch him _after_ his spectacles had fallen off. It was submitted that because the victim suffers from myopia of approximately 350 degrees in both eyes, he would not have been able to see clearly during the scuffle and could therefore not have positively confirmed that it was Goh who had punched him.

167    It was highlighted that PW5 was the only other witness who claimed to have seen Goh punch the victim. It was submitted that PW5’s evidence was not only similarly implausible, but also contradicted the victim’s evidence on Goh’s alleged punches. PW5 claimed he saw the punches from approximately 10 meters away and with about 20 people between the victim and himself. PW5’s explanation for this was that he could still see Lim and Goh punching the victim because the punches that they were throwing came from overhead and estimated that about five overhead punches were delivered collectively. By contrast, the victim’s evidence was that Goh had “_hit \[him\] on the side of the head_ **_from the side_**”. It was the Defence’s case that the evidence of the only two witnesses who allegedly saw Goh punch the victim were inconsistent.

168    It was highlighted that the only objective evidence that Goh had allegedly punched the victim is the medical report at _Exhibit P15_, which states that the victim had “_minute swelling over the left temporal region with minimal tenderness_” and “_soft tissue trauma following head injury_”. It was submitted that given the victim’s evidence that Goh had allegedly punched him on the same part of his head as Lim, there was reasonable doubt whether the victim’s injuries as reflected in the medial report were caused by Goh’s alleged punches or by Lim’s punches.

169    Finally, it was submitted that the victim’s belief that Goh had punched him was explicable by the fact that:

> (a)     the scuffle was extremely chaotic;

> (b)     the victim’s spectacles had fallen off and he could not see clearly; and

> (c)     Goh was actively trying to break up the fight by blocking Lim’s punches and pushing the victim away from Lim at the same time,

so the victim may have mistaken one of Lim’s punches as coming from Goh instead. It was further submitted that there was simply no reason for Goh to change his mind and punch the victim after having tried to stop the fight.

### H   Goh was trying to stop the fight.

170    It was submitted that there was reasonable doubt that Goh had intended to prevent the victim from discharging his public duties. There was overwhelming evidence that Goh was simply trying to stop the fight. It was the Defence’s case that Goh had given a detailed and credible account of how he tried to stop the fight. He had initially tried to hold Lim back and subsequently positioned himself between both Lim and the victim to physically separate them. He had reached his right hand across Lim’s body to block Lim’s blows on the victim.

171    It was further submitted that his testimony was corroborated by DW4, who testified that he personally witnessed Goh trying to stop the fight. In addition, the victim’s own evidence corroborated Goh’s evidence. It was the Defence’s case that the victim admitted that Goh was trying to prevent Lim from further assaulting him. It was submitted that this negated the possibility that Goh was participating in the assault on the victim.

### I   There was no intention to prevent the victim from executing his duty as a public servant or discharging his official duty.

172    It was the Defence’s case that Goh and Leong did not have any intention to prevent the victim from discharging his duties. It was submitted that Leong was not aware that the victim was an officer and could not have known that the victim was effecting the arrest of Lim. In any event, given the victim’s aggressive posturing, the victim appeared to both Goh and Leong to be having a heated argument with Lim. It was further submitted that there were no apparent grounds for any alleged arrest and the victim was not, in fact, arresting Lim. It was the Defence’s case that there was reasonable doubt that Goh and Leong had knowledge or reason to believe that the victim was discharging his duties as a public servant and effecting Lim’s arrest.

### J   The victim did not appear to be effecting arrest of Lim

173    It was submitted that for context, Lim, Goh, Leong, DW4 and DW5 all gave evidence that they were avoiding the fight that broke out on the dance floor and fully intended to leave the chaotic situation inside Club Envy. It was evident that the group had wanted to leave the club peacefully. Prior to the fight breaking out, Goh saw Lim talking to the victim and “_\[he\] thought they were just talking so \[he\] didn’t mind them_”. The evidence PW2 and DW4 similarly establish that this conversation between Lim and the victim appeared to be an ordinary one.

174    It was further submitted that against this backdrop, there was no apparent reason for a police officer to arrest a member of the group. Leong was engaged in conversation with DW5 and was not paying attention to the group. By the time she turned her head towards the group, she saw the victim suddenly charging towards Lim. It was the Defence’s case that Leong had no reason to believe that the victim was – allegedly – trying to arrest Lim.

175    On the contrary, because of his aggressive mannerisms, the victim appeared to Leong to be a patron picking a fight with Lim. Goh had also testified that the victim appeared aggressive and his instinct was to stop the fight, as opposed stopping an arrest. It was submitted that the CCTV footage corroborates Goh’s, Leong’s and DW4’s testimony that the victim had charged towards Lim chest-first. It was the Defence’s case that it was inconsistent with an officer’s conduct of effecting arrest. If Lim had indeed been effecting arrest (which was disputed), it would have been more logical for the victim to reach his hands out towards Lim but this was evidently not the case.

176    It was further submitted that the victim’s characterisation of his conduct as effecting arrest was not only a self-serving afterthought, but also wholly illogical. It was the Defence’s case that any person in Goh’s and Leong’s positions would have believed that the victim was the aggressor and had initiated a fight. It was submitted that the victim’s actions were not consistent with his alleged effecting of arrest.

### K   Goh’s and Leong’s intentions were to stop the fight between Lim and the victim

177    It was the Defence’s case that the entire group, including Goh and Leong had tried to break up the fight. In his statement at _Exhibit P11_, when Goh was asked whether his intention was to hurt the Police Officer, his answer was “_No, it was not. I just wanted to stop Yang Horng from hitting the officer and to stop the scuffle._” It was submitted that Goh had perceived the incident to be a “_scuffle_”, and there was no hint nor suggestion of the victim’s actions being that of attempted arrest.

178    Likewise, Leong had only witnessed the victim acting aggressively and charging towards Lim. According to her she had lightly held the victim’s shoulder to ask him to calm down and only tightened her grip because she almost fell on two occasions. In the circumstances, it was further submitted at the Prosecution had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Goh and Leong knew or had reason to believe that the victim was allegedly effecting arrest.

### L   There was no common intention to cause hurt to the victim to prevent him from discharging any public duties.

179    The Defence had emphasized that the entire group, including Goh and Leong had tried to break up the fight. Goh’s evidence that he was trying to stop the fight was corroborated by Lim, DW4 and even the victim himself. Leong’s evidence that she was not aware of the victim’s identity and how the fight started was corroborated by DW5. She therefore could not have formed any common intention to cause hurt to a public servant.

180    It was submitted that the Prosecution had failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Goh and Leong shared a common intention to cause hurt to the victim to deter him from discharging his public duties. In light of the foregoing, it was the Defence’s case that Goh and Leong should be acquitted of the charges against them.

## Analysis of the Evidence and Court’s Findings

181    There were three issues for this Court’s determination in respect of the s 332 read with s 34 Penal Code charge against the accused persons. The issues are:

> (a)     Did the accused persons know that the victim was a public servant in the discharge of his duty as such public servant at the material time?

> (b)     Did the accused persons participate in a criminal act?

> (c)     If they each participated in a criminal act, did the accused persons do so in furtherance of a common intention to voluntarily cause hurt to the victim with the intent to prevent him from arresting Lim.

### A   Did the accused persons know that the victim was a public servant in the discharge of his duty as such public servant at the material time?

182    In the present case, it was undisputed that although the victim was in plainclothes, he was wearing a police lanyard with his police warrant card attached to it. I was of the view that this was obvious from the club’s CCTV footage from Timestamp 4:09:28 am onwards. It was clear from Timestamp 4:09:28 am to 4:09:44 am, the victim was using his mobile phone and appeared to be making a call. I further noted from Timestamp 4:09:28 am to 4:09:44 am, the accused persons’ group could be seen coming from the dance floor towards the victim’s direction and gathering around a table very close to the victim.

183    The victim had testified on the sequence of events prior and during the assault on him by the accused persons. The victim had seen the accused persons’ group coming from the dance floor area and stopped near the entrance of Club Envy. It was evident that the victim had first engaged the accused persons’ group at their table from Timestamp 4:09:28 am. According to his evidence, the victim had questioned them if they were involved in the fight. However, as no reply was forthcoming from them, he had told them to leave the club immediately if they were not involved.

184    According to the victim, he had used a firm tone to question them and Lim had responded in a challenging manner, “_Why should I leave the club?”_ In response to Lim’s challenge, the victim had identified himself that he was from the police. I noted that from the footage the victim was seen engaging the accused persons’ group from Timestamp 4:10 am to 4:10:07 am. I further noted at Timestamp 4:10:08 am, the victim had walked away from the group but had turned back almost immediately towards the group.

185    In my view based on the clear and consistent testimony of the victim who had identified himself as a police officer, worn his police lanyard with his police warrant card, the evidence of his interaction with the accused persons’ group and the objective corroboration of the victim’s evidence from the club’s CCTV footage, I found on the facts that the accused persons knew that the victim was a public servant _ie_, a police officer who was discharging his duty as such public servant at the material time.

186    Furthermore, as it was undisputed that Goh was aware that he was a police officer from his earlier encounter with the police (including the victim) at Club Viva, he was aware that the victim was a public servant who was discharging his duties at the material time. I agreed with the Prosecution that Lim and Leong had objective knowledge that the victim was a police officer discharging his duties based on the surrounding circumstances as set out above. Accordingly, I rejected Lim and Leong’s defence that they were both unaware that the victim was a police officer discharging his duties and that they had thought he was just a patron looking for trouble.

187    It was clear that both Lim and Leong had sought to distance themselves from this knowledge by feigning ignorance and casting unsubstantiated aspersions on the victim’s behaviour towards them. I rejected Lim’s unsupported claim that the entire instance had started when the victim had bumped into Lim as this was not supported by the CCTV footage and Lim had conceded this in his cross-examination. I agreed with the Prosecution that it was more likely and it can be inferred from the facts that Lim was probably annoyed that the fun and good mood which he and his friends were having had ended abruptly because of the fight at the dance floor. I further rejected Leong assertion that she was not aware of how the scuffle first started as she was not paying attention to Lim and the victim. In my view, due to the very close proximity between the victim and the accused persons’ group, she would have been privy to what the victim had said when he first engaged their group.

188    In my view, the Defence’s assertion that the victim was aggressive as he had allegedly charged towards Lim chest-first was a gross exaggeration of the actual situation to support their claim that he had acted in excess of his authority. This was clearly unsupported by the objective evidence from the CCTV footage. Accordingly, I did not accept Lim’s defence that he had perceived the victim’s approach as a threat to his safety and had pre-emptively attacked the victim.

189    I also found that the Defence’s characterisation of the victim as being a little too self-important, an officer who did not behave properly (who allowed his ego to get in the way of his public duty) and who has now implausibly embellished his version of events to deflect attention from his shortcomings was unmeritorious and without any factual basis. Hence, I was unable to accept and rejected this unwarranted characterisation of the victim.

### B   Did the accused persons participate in a criminal act?

190    The victim gave evidence that after he had turned around to move away from the group, he heard a male voice from the group say “_fuck you, police”_. He then turned back and asked the group, “What did you say?” Lim responded by gesturing and uttering the words “_fuck you, chee bye police”_. According to the victim, he felt it was very degrading and offensive towards the police. He wanted to make a check on Lim and potentially place him under arrest by trying to pin him against the wall to effect an arrest. While doing so, the victim was punched by Lim on the left side of his face. Lim then threw a second punch while the victim was holding on to him causing his spectacles to fall. Lim continued to rain punches on the victim and at that moment, there was a scuffle between him and the three accused persons.

191    It was the Prosecution’s case that Lim had punched the victim at least three times on his face, Goh had punched him at least once on his face while Leong had grabbed the victim’s neck forcefully either with one or both arms. This assault on the victim firstly by Lim and very soon after followed by Goh and Leong were witnessed by both PW3 and PW5 and further corroborated by the CCTV footage. In addition, I noted that it was undisputed that Lim had punched the victim’s face at least three times. I declined to draw an adverse inference against the victim’s testimony in respect of the discrepancy between the victim’s account of when the assault occurred and the Summary of Facts in the Case for the Prosecution as in my view it was not a material discrepancy.

192    On the facts, I accepted the victim’s cogent version of the close-quarters attack on him and found that there was objective corroboration from the CCTV footage. It was clear that the attack on the victim by the accused persons began shortly at Timestamp 4:10:08 am to 4:10:11 am when Lim threw his first punch and it was clear from the footage that both Goh and Leong had joined in the assault lasting over one minute on the victim very soon after.

193    On the facts, although it was undisputed that Goh had initially tried to stop Lim’s assault on the victim, I accepted the testimonies of the victim, PW3 and PW5 that Goh had punched the victim on the left side of the face soon after and rejected Goh’s uncorroborated bare denial. I further rejected Goh’s assertion that the victim could have mistaken Goh’s act of pushing Lim and the victim away with that of punching. I agreed with the Prosecution that victim’s identification evidence of Goh punching him remained unshaken particularly since there was corroboration by PW3 and PW5.

194    It was the Prosecution’s case that Leong had grabbed the victim’s neck forcefully with one or both of her arms. She had exerted a strong force that caused the victim to feel suffocated. Her actions had been witnessed by PW3 and PW4 who had corroborated the victim’s account of Leong’s assault on the victim. I found his evidence internally consistent and credible as it was objectively corroborated by the CCTV footage.

195    I rejected Leong’s defence that she had merely lightly tapped his shoulder to ask him to stop fighting with Lim and to calm him down but as he had charged forward, she had grabbed harder on his shoulder area so that he would not move forward as this was clearly not borne out in the CCTV footage. I noted that her account in Court was also inconsistent with her version in her s 22 CPC statement where she stated that she had put her hand on the victim’s shoulders to ask him to stop and but he refused. She had then tightened her grip and it might have caused it to be over his neck.

196    From the above, it was clear that all three had participated in the criminal act against the victim. Accordingly, on the facts I found that this element had been made out.

### C   Did the accused persons participate in a criminal act in furtherance of a common intention to voluntarily cause hurt to the victim with the intent to prevent him from arresting Lim

197    It was the Prosecution’s case that the surrounding circumstances ought to enable this Court to infer that there was such a common intention between the accused persons to cause hurt to the victim in order to prevent Lim’s arrest. In the present case, Lim had started the assault by throwing the first punch at the victim. He continued to assault the victim even after the latter had identified himself as a police officer and had held onto his shirt collar as he tried to effect an arrest. Lim had stated in his examination-in-chief that he punched the victim because he wanted to break free. I agreed with the Prosecution that the irresistible inference that can be drawn from this was that Lim punched the victim in order for the latter to release his grip on him and prevent the accused from arresting him.

198    As for Goh, PW3 had testified that Goh was seen trying to stop the victim from arresting Lim by pushing the victim away. PW4 had testified that Goh and Lim were throwing overhead punches at the victim’s head. As Goh knew the victim was a police officer and as he was standing just next to Lim at all material times during the scuffle, he would have been aware of what Lim was trying to prevent his own arrest when he was assaulting the victim.

199    I agreed with the Prosecution’s case that Goh’s claim that he was unaware that the victim would have been trying to arrest Lim was unbelievable since he had seen Lim punch the victim. I further agreed with the Prosecution that putting these strands of evidence together, it was clear that Goh formed the same common intention with Lim on the spot to cause hurt to the victim in order to prevent him from arresting Lim. This was after he tried and failed to pull Lim away from the victim who was arresting him.

200    In relation to Leong, I was mindful that the victim, PW3 and PW4 had testified that she had one of her arms around the victim’s neck and had forcefully grabbed and pulled it. While placing the victim’s neck in a neck lock, she had also called out to her friends to run. This came only after the victim was punched by Lim and he had grabbed onto both Lim and Goh’ shirt collars. In addition, they had also testified that Leong did not let go of the victim’s neck even after they identified themselves as police officers. PW4’s testimony that Leong had told him that the victim was trying to arrest her friend, i.e. Lim, in response to his demand to let go of the victim was also unchallenged.

201    I agreed with the Prosecution’s case that pulling the strands of evidence together for Leong, it was clear she knew that after Lim had thrown the first punch at the victim that Lim was in trouble with the law as he had punched a police officer. Hence, forming the same common intention on the spot, she forcefully grabbed the victim’s neck and pulled it to overpower and restrain him and prevent him from arresting Lim while Lim and Goh rained punches on the victim.

202    In my view based on the above, I found on the facts that the accused persons had each participated in a criminal act in furtherance of a common intention to voluntarily cause hurt to the victim with the intent to prevent him from arresting Lim. I was also of the view that this was clearly evident from the footage itself when all the accused persons had almost simultaneously converged on the victim, overwhelmed him with their numbers and caused hurt to the victim as reflected in the medical report _Exhibit P15_. In my view, on the facts it was it clear in doing so they had all shared the common intention that was formed on the spot to cause hurt to the victim in order to prevent the victim from arresting Lim.

203    I next turn to the remaining charge against Lim.

### D   Did Lim use abusive words on the victim in relation to the execution of his duty as a public servant?

204    It was the Prosecution’s case that Lim did not deny uttering the abusive words “_fuck you, chee bye”_ to the victim at about 4.10am on 12 November 2017. This use of the abusive words was heard by the victim, by PW3 and also his friend DW4. The issue in was whether Lim had uttered those words to the victim in relation to the execution of his duty as a public servant, i.e. a police officer.

205    I noted that the main thrust of Lim’s defence in respect of both charges was that he did not have the requisite _mens rea_ to constitute the offence in question, namely, Lim did not know that the victim was a public servant going about his duties.

206    Based on the clear, consistent and cogent testimony of the victim who had identified himself as a police officer, worn his police lanyard with his police warrant card, his interaction with the accused persons’ group and the objective corroboration of the victim’s evidence from the club’s CCTV footage, I found that Lim had the requisite knowledge that the victim was a police officer in the present case. Accordingly, on the fact, I found that all the elements of the offence of using abusive words towards a police officer in relation to the execution of his duty had been made out.

## Conviction

207    Having carefully scrutinised the totality of the evidence and the submissions made before me, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case on the proceeded charges against each of the three accused persons beyond a reasonable doubt. As such, I found the three accused persons guilty and convicted them of their respective charges.

## Sentence

### Prescribed Penalties

208    The prescribed punishment for an offence under s 332 of the Penal Code is a term of imprisonment with may extend to 7 years, or with fine, or with caning or with any combination of such punishments.

209    In addition, the prescribed punishment for an offence under s 6(1)(a) of the Protection from Harassment Act is a fine not exceeding $5,000, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months of to both.

### Antecedents

210    All the accused persons were untraced.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

211    It was the Prosecution’s case that this was a case of youthful impetuousness which degenerated into unprovoked violence against a police officer who was merely doing his duty. This was exacerbated by disdain towards authority and blind loyalty to help friends avoid an arrest. It was submitted that such behaviour ought not to be condoned and the Court should mete out an appropriate sentence to deter such acts of senseless group violence towards police officers who are in the line of duty.

212    Essentially, the Prosecution had sought a sentence of at least 13 months’ imprisonment for each accused person on the s 332 read with s 34 Penal Code charges. As for Lim’s s 6(3) POHA charge, the Prosecution had indicated that it had no objection to the imposition of a fine and left the quantum to the Court’s discretion.

213    The Prosecution had relied on the sentencing framework set out by the High Court in _PP v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey and anor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1080</span> (“Jeffrey Yeo”) to support its position on sentence. It was submitted that in that case, the High Court had emphasized at \[48\] to \[50\] that police officers are often exposed to violence and aggression in their frontline duties daily, and the law must protect them from such violence so that they can effectively discharge their duties. To achieve this, it was therefore clear that the principles of general and specific deterrence ought to apply when sentencing offenders who exact violence, especially of the physical kind, on police officers. At \[59\] of _Jeffrey Yeo_, the High Court set out the sentencing framework for offenders who had pleaded guilty and who do not have relevant criminal antecedents. It was further submitted that appropriate adjustments may be made when the offender claims trial and makes unwarranted allegations against the victim. The framework is set out as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="24.3%"> <col width="42.98%"> <col width="32.72%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Category</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Circumstances</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentencing Band</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Lesser harm and lower culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Fine or up to one year’s imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Greater harm and lower culpability or</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Lesser harm and higher culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">One to three years’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Greater harm and higher culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Three to seven years’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

214    It was further submitted that the High Court had also set out a non-exhaustive list of factors at \[60\] of the case relating the harm and culpability of the offence so as to assist the sentencing court to determine which Category the offender would fall into. In sentencing two or more offenders for participation in the same offence, their sentences should be the same, unless there is a relevant difference in their responsibility for the offence or their personal circumstances: _PP v Ramlee_ \[1998\] 3 SLR 539 at \[7\]. In other words, the severity of the sentence imposed should reflect the role played by the offender in committing the offence.

215    It was the Prosecution’s case that it was also trite in group offences involving violence, such as rioting or the present case involving the s 332 read with s 34 of the Penal Code charges, the offender is also not sentenced for his individual acts considered in isolation but on the totality of the consequences which the offence causes.

216    With these principles in mind, it was submitted that the accused persons fall under Category 2 of the sentencing framework in _Jeffrey Yeo_, and that the indicative starting point for all three accused persons would be at the lower end of the range of one to three years’ imprisonment. Although lesser harm was caused to the victim (he sustained minute swelling over the left temporal region with minimal tenderness and was given two days’ MC), their culpability is nevertheless high because of the following aggravating factors:

##### (1)    _Number of offenders involved_

217    It was the Prosecution’s case that this was a group attack comprising three accused persons who had overwhelmed a single police officer.

##### (2)    _The offence involved an unprovoked and sustained attack on a vulnerable part_ of the body

218    It was submitted that Lim had launched an unprovoked and sustained attack on the victim by punching him at least three times to his face and head, which is a vulnerable part of his body. All the victim had done was merely to tell Lim’s group of friends, including the other accused persons, to leave the club if they were not involved in the fight at the dance floor. Even if the victim had behaved in an unprofessional or unreasonable manner, it did not warrant such a disproportionate and senselessly violently response.

219    It was further submitted while Goh and Leong did not exact the same degree of violence on the victim as Lim, their actions were also similarly aggravating. Goh had punched the victim at least once on his face, while Leong held the victim in a neck-lock which in the victim’s words, had “_suffocated_” him. It was the Prosecution’s case that Leong had held onto the victim in this manner for an extended period. She did not let go even when PW4 identified himself when ordered her to release her grip on the victim. It was only when other police officers and bouncers came to pull her away did she then release the neck-lock.

220    It was submitted that while the entire assault lasted less than a minute, it only ended because of the intervention of other police officers such as PW4 and PW5.

##### (3)    _The location and timing of the offence potentially posed a detrimental impact to public order_

221    It was submitted that it was clear from the CCTV footage that the offence took place in a crowded club and in full public glare. In addition, there was a fight happening at the dance floor which police officers had been scrambled to deal with. The potential for a public order disaster would have been great at the material time when the victim, a police officer who was responding to the said fight was assaulted. It was fortuitous that this did not materialize.

##### (4)    _The offenders’ motivations for causing hurt to the victim showed contempt to the victim’s authority as a police officer_

222    It was submitted that Lim’s actions clearly demonstrate contempt towards the victim’s authority as a police officer. He had verbally abused the victim despite being informed firmly and politely to leave the club if he and his friends were not involved in the fight at the dance floor. Lim then escalated this by launching an attack on the victim.

223    It was further submitted that although Goh and Leong did not initiate the violence against the victim, their actions should not be seen as less culpable than Lim because they had helped their friend, Lim to avoid being arrested by attacking the victim. Their blind loyalty towards their friend ought to be regarded as an aggravating factor.

224    It was the Prosecution’s case that Goh may have initially tried to stop the fight but this was not excusable as the victim was trying to initiate an arrest. Furthermore, Goh has no excuse to punch the victim if he wanted to stop the fight. The necessary inference to be drawn here was that Goh had also no regard for the victim’s authority as a police officer when he decided to punch him.

225    It was submitted that Leong’s motive to grab on to the victim’s neck forcefully was to prevent him from arresting Lim and for the other two accused persons to assault him and deter the arrest. This could be seen in Leong telling the other accused persons to run, and that she did not let go of the victim’s neck even when PW4 had identified himself as a police officer and ordered her to let go.

226    It was further submitted that Leong had utter disdain towards the authority of the police officers at the scene. Further, while Leong’s neck-lock did not appear to cause any physical injuries on the victim, it was the Prosecution’s case that her act cannot be viewed in isolation. Her act had essentially immobilized the victim from defending himself and discharging his duty as a police officer. Her act had facilitated the other two accused persons to punch the victim without restraint. Her culpability should therefore be as high as the other two accused persons.

227    The Prosecution recognised that all three accused persons are untraced, and that there was no premeditation to assault the victim. These would be mitigating factors to adjust the sentence downwards.

228    Finally, it was submitted that adjustments was to be made for the fact that the accused persons had claimed trial and therefore should not be accorded a sentencing discount. Furthermore, the Defence had claimed that the victim had behaved in an unprofessional, pugnacious and gangster-like manner towards Lim. This was a baseless accusation and was a futile attempt to excuse their actions for attacking a police officer.

### Conclusion

229    It was the Prosecution’s case that taking all these factors into account, a sentence of at least 13 months’ imprisonment would be a fair and appropriate sentence. It would take into account the accused persons’ culpability in the commission of the offence, as well as achieve the aim of general and specific deterrence.

### Mitigation & Defence’s Submissions on Sentence

230    The accused persons, Goh Jun Fong and Leong Yin Teng Coretta had been on 1 April 2020 – each for a charge of voluntarily causing hurt to a police officer in furtherance of a common intention between them and the victim. The charges were pursuant to s 332 read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). It was highlighted that both of them did not face any other charges that were to be taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. Given that both were relatively young first offenders, the Defence had submitted that the Court should call for probation suitability reports to be prepared for the accused persons.

### Goh and Leong’s mitigation

231    Counsel for both Goh and Leong had highlighted that they were only 23 years old at the time of the offence, and are 25 and 26 years old at the time of sentencing respectively. It was the Defence’s case that even though they were adult offenders both at the time of offence and sentencing, the Court may still impose probation on the basis that they “_\[demonstrate\] an extremely strong propensity for reform, such that rehabilitation comes to the fore_” (_Public Prosecutor v Siow Kai Yuan Terence_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 82</span> (“_Terence Siow_”) at \[40\]). It was submitted that while the significance of this rehabilitation “_could be eclipsed by an emphasis on the need for deterrence_”, the Learned Chief Justice highlighted that these are only in circumstances “_where, for example, the offence was a serious one, or the harm caused was severe_” (_Terence Siow_ at \[40\]).

232    The High Court in _Terence Siow_ prescribed the following three-limbed framework (at \[55\]) to evaluate whether a particular offender has demonstrated an extremely strong propensity for reform:

> (a)     First, the court should consider whether the offender has demonstrated a positive desire to change since the commission of the offence (the “First Limb”).

> (b)     Second, the court should consider whether there are conditions in the offender’s life that are conducive to helping him turn over a new leaf (the “Second Limb”).

> (c)     If, after considering the first two limbs, the court comes to a provisional view that the offender has demonstrated an extremely strong propensity for reform, the court should then consider, in light of the risk factors presented, whether there are reasons to revisit the finding of such a high capacity for reform (the “Third Limb”).

### Goh

233    It was the Defence’s case that under the First Limb, Goh had demonstrated a positive desire to change. Immediately after the incident, he resolved not to set foot in any club, and he has successfully upheld such resolve to date. He had also quit heavy drinking since then and had not re-offended since the incident. He had continued to work hard in his job and focused on improving his life since the incident. His manager, Mr. Kenji Lee from Prudential Assurance Company (Singapore) Pte Ltd (”**PACS**”) had attested in his testimonial that he “_witnessed Marcus_ going through immense stress due to this lawsuit over the past two years, but this has never impeded his work performance. His resilience and commitment towards his work made him an extremely valued FC in _the agency and advisor to his clients._”

234    He had also been enrolled in Murdoch University since May 2017 at Kaplan Higher Education and commencing his Bachelor of Science degree. Notably, his offence was also highly out of character. He was untraced, first time offender. His Counsel had enclosed testimonials by his partner, friends, and family as evidence in support of his good character.

235    Under the Second Limb, it was submitted that he has strong familial support in his journey towards reform. He lives with his mother, his grandmother, his elder sister, and a domestic helper for his grandmother in a four-room flat in Bukit Panjang. His sister is pursuing her tertiary education at Ngee Ann Polytechnic pursuant to a bond with the Singapore Civil Defence Force and is mostly at home to keep an eye on him throughout the day.

236    He is also extremely close to his older brother, who visits the family with the latter’s fiancée every weekend for dinner and keeps in close contact with him. His mother, who works for his aunt, had also made arrangements to allow her to spend more time at home to take care of his grandmother. This will also allow her to spend more time with him and oversee his activities.

237    He is also the person in the family who is closest to, and keeps in contact with, his divorced father. His father is dependent on him for many things, including reading letters, assistance at his workplace, and he also helps pay some of his father’s bills at times.

238    He also has the support of his fiancée, who has been his close friend for five years and romantic partner for two. He spends almost all his free time apart from his family with her who has been a major motivation for him to stay out of trouble. She stays over at his house often, and the couple has plans to obtain a Build-to-Order HDB flat and get married in the near future.

239    It was submitted that he is a gainfully employed insurance agent with PACS. He had been described by his manager as a resilient and committed worker who is valued by both his company and his clients, and he has continued to work diligently through these two tough years notwithstanding the ongoing charge against him. Even though his income is insubstantial, he contributes to the family financially by paying for his father’s and sister’s insurance premiums, and gives a token allowance to both of his parents every month. He had been working hard to ensure that his family members who are partly financially dependent on him do not suffer for his errors as well.

240    It was the Defence’s case that his financial contributions to his families is an especially significant indicator of his sense of responsibility given his youth. Additionally, he had also taken concrete steps to further his education by enrolling in Murdoch University in May 2017 at Kaplan Higher Education and commencing his Bachelor of Science degree. The High Court in _Terence Siow_ (at \[57(d)\]) pointed out – as did the DPP in that case accept – that “_enrolment in school is frequently accepted as a protective factor – because it minimizes the opportunities for a young offender to associate with negative peers, and keeps him within a structured environment where he can learn discipline and receive positive guidance from teachers._”

(%3)       It was submitted that he was about to begin his final year project, which is a major milestone for his double major in computer science and business information systems.

241    It was submitted that all the factors point towards him demonstrating an extremely high propensity for reform. He was studying part time while he works as an insurance agent with PACS; lives with his family, which he has an extremely close relationship with; and is in a stable relationship with a loving fiancée with which he has plans to get married and move in together. He spends very little of his free time away from his family and/or his fiancée, and therefore has little to no opportunity to get himself in any sort of trouble at all.

242    It was further submitted that there were no identifiable risk factors under the Third Limb in the present case for Goh. The offence was also not so serious nor the harm so severe that the significance of this rehabilitation “_could be eclipsed by an emphasis on the need for deterrence_” (_Terence Siow_ at \[40\]). His involvement in the offence was peripheral and secondary to the primary perpetrator’s – Lim. Lim was the main person involved in the scuffle with the police officer, and several witnesses at trial even confirmed that Goh was attempting to break the fight up. This notably included _Prosecution_ witnesses as well.

### Leong

243    It was the Defence’s case that under the First Limb, Leong had demonstrated a positive desire to change. Immediately after the incident, she had resolved not to set foot in any club, and she has successfully upheld such resolve to date. She had also quit heavy drinking since then and had not re-offended since the incident. She had continued to work hard in her jobs and focused on improving her life since the incident. According to her manager Mr Lucas Tai Shin Fatt from PACS he had noted that Leong had “_worked harder and make ends meet_” since the proceedings begun, especially since she contributes to half of the mortgage payments for the home in which she lives with her father and pays for her legal fees herself.

244    It was submitted that Leong’s offence was also highly out of character. She was an untraced, first time offender who had never had any prior brushes with the law, let alone any related antecedents. Her Counsel enclosed testimonials from her manager, teachers, and representatives of the charitable organisations that she had worked with as evidence in support of her good character.

245    It was submitted that under the Second Limb, Leong has strong familial support in her journey towards reform: She lives with her father in a 3-room HDB flat in Clementi – she has been doing so ever since her parents were separated. Her father is both emotionally and financially reliant on her. He is 65 years old, and he suffers from glaucoma and other illnesses that forced him to retire from his main job as a maritime worker about 5 to 6 years ago. He then became a driver.

246    It was further submitted that since then, Leong has been working to help pay for half of the mortgage payments for the flat as well as the utility bills for the home to alleviate the financial pressure on her father. However, her father’s condition had continued to worsen, and he would likely have to retire from his job as a driver in the near future as well. She also has a close relationship with her mother, even though they live apart. Her mother is her bailor for the current proceedings.

247    It was submitted that Leong also has the support of her boyfriend of 2 years. The couple have plans to get married and buy a home together in the next 1 or 2 years to start a life together. She treasures the relationship deeply, and would not do anything to jeopardise it if probation were imposed on her for her regrettable actions.

248    She is a gainfully employed insurance agent with PACS. Her manager at PACS had noticed that that she had “_worked harder and make ends meet_” since the proceedings begun. She had taken it upon herself to ensure that any financial strains caused by these proceedings would not negatively impact her family members who are financially dependent on her. Despite the difficulty of having to deal with these ongoing proceedings, she had persisted and worked even harder so that she could pay for her own legal fees while continuing to pay for half of her father’s housing mortgage and utility bills, even though her salary is insubstantial. It was the Defence’s case that her financial contributions to her family is an especially significant indicator of her sense of responsibility given her youth.

249    It was submitted that all the factors pointed towards her demonstrating an extremely high propensity for reform as well. She remained extremely driven in her work due to her strong sense of responsibility and filial piety in wanting to ensure that her parents do not suffer the financial strain of her actions. She lives with her father with whom she has an extremely close relationship, and who is also both emotionally and financially dependent on her. Given her father’s impending retirement, he would be able to stay at home and oversee Leong during the period of her probation. In his absence, she would also have the care and guidance of her boyfriend, whom she plans to marry and buy a home with.

250    It was further submitted that there were no identifiable risk factors under the Third Limb in the present case for Leong. The offence in the present case was also not so serious nor the harm so severe that the significance of this rehabilitation “_could be eclipsed by an emphasis on the need for deterrence_” (_Terence Siow_ at \[40\]). It was the Defence’s case that her involvement in the offence was peripheral and secondary to the primary perpetrator’s – Lim. Lim was the main person involved in the scuffle with the police officer. It was submitted that her grip on the police officer’s neck was also not severe enough to cause any lasting bruising or injury on the victim, such that it did not turn up in the medical notes of the doctor who saw the police officer after the incident.

251    In light of the foregoing, the Defence had urged the Court to call for probation suitability reports for both Goh and Leong due to their relative youth, as well as the fact that they have demonstrated extremely strong propensities to reform.

### Lim’s Mitigation

252    Counsel for Lim had highlighted that he faced the following two charges:

> (a)     DAC-940613-2017: one count of voluntarily causing hurt to a public servant in discharge of duty under s 332 read with s 34 of the Penal Code;

> (b)     MAC-912583-2017: one count of using s 6(3) of the Protection from Harassment Act.

253    It was submitted that Lim’s level of culpability was not altogether high. The assault took place on the spur of the moment; it was neither premeditated nor planned. The offences lasted for no more than one minute. It was also submitted that the level of harm caused was minimal. The victim did not suffer any serious or permanent injuries.

254    It was submitted that this was Lim’s absolute first brush with the law. He was hot-blooded and relatively young at the time of the offence, _ie_, 23 years old. Lim has stopped drinking since the offence. It was further submitted that he had not committed any other offences since the ones that are the subject of the present prosecution. It was the Defence’s case that there was a low prospect of recidivism.

255    It was submitted that Lim’s mother was diagnosed with stroke on 1 June 2016 and has not recovered since. She is certified disabled by the doctor. Lim’s father is a retiree living off his CPF monies. He is unable to secure any gainful employment as he needs to care for Lim’s mother. Lim is the eldest child in the family. It was further submitted that he graduated with a business development degree from the Singapore Institute of Management in 2018 but was unable to commit to a full-time job due to this matter. He hoped to quickly close this unpleasant chapter of his life and to pursue a career in business development on his release.

#### Submissions on sentence

256    Counsel for Lim had proposed a custodial sentence of less than six months on the s 332 Penal Code charge and a small fine on the s 6(1)(a) POHA charge. The Defence had similarly referred to the sentencing framework in _PP v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey and anor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1080</span> for offences under s 332 of the Penal Code.

257    It was submitted that the Prosecution had contended that the offence fell within Category 2. Having regard to the Court’s illustrations of decided cases (at \[62\] – \[74\]), the Defence was unable to agree, as the Category 2 illustrations reflect a much higher degree of culpability and/or harm. Instead, it was the Defence’s case that the offence fell within Category 1.

258    It was submitted that on these facts, there were, at best, only two aggravating factors that enhanced the culpability of Lim, namely, that there was more than one offender involved and the offence took place within the public’s view and hearing.

259    It was further submitted that the offence was not sustained or repeated. In _Ho Mei Xia Hannah_ v PP and anor <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 978</span> (“_Hannah Ho_”), the Prosecution argued (at \[31\]) _inter alia_ that an assault on three separate police officers that took place within approximately ten minutes was sustained. The High Court, however, was of the view that the assault _“cannot be said to have been sustained or traumatic”_ whether collectively or individually. Even though it is true that Lim had thrown more than one punch at the victim, the assault in question lasted no more than one minute. Furthermore, it was not disputed that there were others caught in the scuffle who tried to separate Lim from the victim at the material time. If anything, this would have weakened the force of Lim’s second and third punches. For these reasons, the offence should not be characterised as sustained or repeated.

260    It was highlighted that in _Hannah Ho_, a post-_Jeffrey Yeo_ case, the offender was convicted of various charges involving disorderly behaviour, using abusive words towards a public servant and three count of voluntarily causing hurt to a public servant. On appeal, the High Court held that the offender’s culpability was in the middle of the Category 1 range in _Jeffrey Yeo_. The factors that the Court had considered were as follows:

> (a)     Having been told that the officer was placing her under arrest, the offender became violent and physically assaulted three police officers. The offender had even bit one of the police officers, which, in the Court’s view (at \[89\]) was more serious than using bare hands. After her arrest, the offender continued to hurl verbal abuse that was targeted the police officer’s role.

> (b)     Actual harm was relatively minor, with the most severe being a 2cm by 2cm hematoma caused by the offender’s bite.

> (c)     The offence took place in the public’s view and hearing. Police officers who were tasked to disperse crowds of people exiting the night clubs at Saint James Power Station spotted the offender engaged in a quarrel with another group due to a dispute that occurred within the club.

> (d)     The offender was no first-time offender; she went on to re-offend quickly after her previous conviction.

It was highlighted that balancing the above factors, the offender’s sentence of 20 weeks (5 months) on the proceeded s 332 Penal Code charge in _Hannah Ho_ was upheld on appeal.

261    It was submitted that the Defence accepted that general and specific deterrence ought to take the centre stage. However, it was further submitted that taking into account the offence-specific and offender-specific factors as stated above, a sentence of six months’ imprisonment, a one month uplift due to the fact that Lim chose to claim trial was sufficient to meet the ends of justice. It was the Defence’s submission that, all things considered, Lim was not significantly more culpable than the offender in _Ho Mei Xia_. Even though there was the presence of a group element, this does not _ipso facto_ increase the culpability of Lim as drastically as contended for by the Prosecution. Indeed, as observed by the High Court in _Arumugam Selvaraj v PP_ \[2019\] 5 SLR 8813, an assault may well _“be on the boundaries of the meaning of the word “group””_ and for that very reason, sentencing should be undertaken with the understanding that _“the situation is perhaps different from an assault by a larger number, as it would be as regards a solo assault”_.

## Prosecution’s Reply

262    In response to Lim’s mitigation, it was the Prosecution’s case that a distinction had to be drawn between being assaulted by multiple punches and a chokehold of one person that took place within a span of less than a minute and assaulting three different police officers once within a span of 10 minutes. It was submitted that the High Court in _Hannah Ho_ was correct in not characterising the attack as sustained in because it happened to three different officers within a span of 10 minutes.

263    In the present case, this was a sustained attack on one victim because one single victim was overwhelmed by three accused persons and he was hit repeatedly on his face. The difference was the intensity of the attack was different in the present case compared to the _Hannah Ho_’s case. It was further submitted that the case of _Hannah Ho_’s case involved a single accused person as opposed to the present case that involved three accused persons. On that count, the facts were different. It was the Prosecution’s case that the assertion by the Defence that the force of punches was weakened by Goh and Leong separating the victim was unsubstantiated as there was no evidence led on this.

264    It was further submitted the case of _Arumugam Selvaraj_ on the definition of the word ‘group’ cited by the Defence involved two accused persons who had assaulted the victim. In the present case, there are three accused persons and the facts in the present case were different from that of _Arumugam Selvaraj_.

265    It was the Prosecution’s case that in _Jeffrey Yeo_’s case one of the aggravating factors that would inform culpability would be the number of offenders. The higher number, the more aggravating it is because a police officer who is in the line of duty when faced with more than one accused person who are exhibiting violence on him would be overwhelmed. The risk of injury and the risk to public order would be exponentially increased.

266    It was the Prosecution’s case that Lim’s mitigation plea had conveniently left out the other aggravating factors namely the unprovoked attack as well as the respective motivations of the attackers. The totality of the offenders’ conduct must be looked at rather than the acts in isolation and hence a sentence of six months was a wholly inadequate sentence.

267    In respect of Goh and Leong’s mitigation, that they would both qualify under both limbs of the _Terence Siow_’s case, it was submitted that all three accused persons are above 21 years of age. The presumptive sentencing consideration is that rehabilitation does not come to play. Deterrence was the dominant sentencing consideration of adult offenders and in the present case particularly so because it involves a serious offence under s 332 of the Penal Code where the maximum sentence is 7 years’ imprisonment. Generally, custodial sentences are imposed except for exceptional cases where they are very young offenders, the hurt caused is a very minor one and there are many mitigating factors. Only then, a fine would be imposed and this is the exception rather than the rule.

268    It was the Prosecution’s case that they would fail under the first limb as they had claimed trial and there was therefore insufficient evidence of remorse. In addition, the Defence has casted aspersions on the victim in the course of the trial by asserting without basis that he had uttered vulgarities at the accused persons group and behaved in an aggressive and hooligan-like manner. It was submitted while it can be seen based on the character references in the testimonials that their behaviour was out of character, it did not excuse them from what they did which was to protect their friend from being arrested. It was further submitted that such behaviour ought to be deterred especially when law enforcement had to come in and that they had not acted in a brutal manner.

269    It was the Prosecution’s case that both Goh and Leong appeared to have familial support. It was highlighted that Leong’s assertion on how supportive her family and boyfriend were of her was not supported by testimonials. It was submitted that even if the Court found that they have shown some strong propensity for reform, deterrence still overrides in the present case because of the nature of the offence and the circumstances of how the offence was committed was serious.

270    On the issue of their respective culpabilities, it was the Prosecution’s case that while Leong did not cause any visible objective injury in the victim’s neck and Goh had punched the victim at least once, their culpability should not be any lower than Lim and that was why it fell under Category 2. This was a common intention charge and the totality of their actions and the consequences of which the offence causes rather than their individual acts are considered. It was the Prosecution’s case that the injuries and all their combined acts showed the total effect on the victim. It was submitted that Leong had grabbed the victim’s neck which is a vulnerable part of the body in a chokehold. This was a dangerous act and it is also an immobilising act and what she did facilitated the other two accused persons to punch the victim.

271    Although Goh had initially tried to stop the fight, it was further submitted that he had just wanted to help his friend to prevent from being arrested. There was no excuse for what he did and this motivation to help his friend avoid an arrest was an aggravating factor. He should be on the same level of culpability as Lim who not only had acted with contempt towards the police officer but had punched the police officer because he did not want to be arrested. It was the Prosecution’s case that although the level of harm was low, the level of culpability was high based on all the aggravating factors and thus the case fell within Category 2.

272    Finally, the Prosecution had objected to the calling of a pre-sentence probation suitability report because it was not an appropriate case. Deterrence was at the end of the day the overriding sentencing consideration as opposed to rehabilitation for adult offenders after taking into account the nature of the offence that was committed.

## Decision on Sentence

#### Whether a probation is an appropriate order

273    In considering whether to call for a probation report suitability report for both Goh and Leong, I was mindful that as a general rule, a probation order is inappropriate for serious offences or where violence has been committed. In the present case, the offences committed by the accused persons were not only serious but one involving violence as reflected in the lengthy maximum sentence of 7 years prescribed for the charges under s 332 read with s 34 of the Penal Code.

274    In the present case, it was undisputed that at the time of the offence, both the accused persons were not young offenders below the age of 21 years. Both of them were 23 years old at the time of the offence and were colleagues at Prudential Assurance Company (Singapore) Pte Ltd.

275    It is trite that rehabilitation can be an operative concern of an offender above the age of 21, only if he or she demonstrates an extremely strong propensity for reform and/or there are exceptional circumstances warranting the grant of probation as set out by the High Court in _Goh Lee Yin_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 1 SLR(R) 530</span> at \[28\]. From their plea in mitigation presented before me, I was unable to discern any evidence that showed that the accused persons had extremely strong propensity for reform and/or there were any exceptional circumstances. Furthermore, there were aggravating factors in the present case that weighed clearly in favour of deterrence.

276    Hence, in the present case, I was not persuaded by Counsel's submission for a pre-sentence suitability report to be called for both Leong and Goh in view of the nature of the offence and the factual matrix of the present case. In my view, deterrence was a predominant sentencing consideration in the present case in light of the serious nature of the offence.

277    I next turn to the appropriate sentences to be imposed on each of the accused persons. In my consideration of the sentences to be imposed in respect of the charge under s 332 read with s 34 of the Penal Code, I had applied the sentencing framework set out by the High Court in _Jeffrey Yeo_. In examining the considerations of both the harm and level of culpability, I considered this case to fall within the higher range of Category 1 and not Category 2 as submitted by the Prosecution.

278    I was of the view that the harm which the victim, a police officer had sustained was low as it was a minute swelling over the left temporal region with minimal tenderness. In essence, he had sustained soft tissue trauma to his head and was given two days of medical leave. Nevertheless, I was of the view that the level of culpability was at the higher end of Category 1 as this was a group attack comprising three accused persons who had overwhelmed a single police officer.

279    I agreed with the Prosecution that was also an unprovoked and sustained attack by the accused persons on the victim. I was mindful that it was undisputed that the attack which ended after over a minute after the intervention of the other police officers and the club bouncers. I also agreed with the Prosecution that as the offence had taken place in a crowded club and in full public glare, the potential for a public order disaster would have been great at the material time when the victim, a police officer who was responding to the said fight at the said club was assaulted.

280    I further agreed with the Prosecution that the accused persons' motivations for causing hurt to the victim showed contempt to the victim's authority as a police officer. I noted that Lim had verbally abused the victim despite being informed firmly and politely to leave the club if he and his friends were not involved in the fight at the dance floor. He then escalated the situation by launching an attack on the victim.

281    In addition, I agreed with the Prosecution that the actions of the other two accused persons could not be seen as being any less culpable than Lim as they had joined in to help Lim to avoid being arrested out of blind loyalty. Goh had no excuse to punch the victim if he really wanted to stop the fight. Leong had grabbed on to the victim's neck forcefully to prevent him from arresting Lim and Lim and Goh to assault the victim and deter the arrest. She had even told Lim and Goh to run, and that she did not let go of the victim's neck even when the other police officers ordered her to let go of her hold on the victim.

282    Apart from the aggravating factors as stated above, I took into account their mitigating factors such as the age of all three accused persons, the fact that they were untraced and that there was no premeditation to assault the victim. I agreed with the Prosecution that it was more an instance of youthful impetuousness and the common intention to cause hurt to deter the victim from carrying out his duties was formed on the spot. Nevertheless, adjustments had to be made for the fact that all three accused persons had claimed trial and thus were not entitled to a sentencing discount. All considered, I imposed a sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment in respect of each of the accused persons for the offence under s 332 read with s 34 of the Penal Code. I agreed with the Prosecution as this was a common intention charge, it was the totality of their actions and the consequences of which the offence causes that determined the sentence imposed. Hence, the parity principle applied in the sentencing of the accused persons and as such they received the same sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment for their respective charges.

283    As for the remaining charge against Lim, I note that fines were usually imposed for an offence under s 6(1)(a) of the Protection from Harassment Act. Both the Prosecution and the Defence were in agreement that a fine should be imposed. Accordingly, after a careful consideration of the fact of the case, in respect of Lim’s second charge in _MAC 912583 - 2017_, I imposed a fine of $2,500 in default 10 days’ imprisonment. In my view a fine falling within the mid-range of the maximum prescribed fine was just and appropriate having regard to the factual matrix of the present case.
