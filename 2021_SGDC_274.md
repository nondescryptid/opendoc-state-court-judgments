### Deputy Registrar Liu Zeming:

1       Applications for the renewal of a writ of summons for the purposes of service are commonplace in civil litigation. Such applications are necessarily made _ex parte_, and disposed of as such. The somewhat routine nature of the application and it being heard _ex parte_ at first instance may have led some litigants to think that such applications would be granted as a matter of course, with little scrutiny. That is not true.

2       The present _ex parte_ application for renewal of writ was heard and dismissed by me. I have decided to issue the grounds of my decision as a reminder to litigants that the discretion to extend the validity of the writ is one which courts exercise _with caution_, and there can be no expectation that such applications would be granted as a matter of course _even if it is made ex parte_. In every case, the party applying for renewal must satisfy the court that there are good reasons to excuse the delay in service, and the consequential need to renew the writ. Further, since an application for renewal of the writ is an _ex parte_ application, the requirement of full and frank disclosure applies, even if it may not be applied with the same stringency as it is, for example, in an application for a search order.

3       Ultimately, it is in the interest of the claimant to ensure that the application to renew the writ is properly made, and the necessary disclosures given at the _ex parte_ stage. If the claimant has no “_good reason_” to renew the writ, he or she may be better off issuing a fresh writ. A claimant who chooses to renew the writ on inadequate grounds, or without making the appropriate disclosures, runs the risk of having the renewal (and any subsequent service) set aside. By that time, it may no longer be feasible for the claimant to pursue a new action for the claim as the limitation period may have lapsed.

4       As usual, I start with a brief background to the application.

## Procedural Background

5       The present proceedings was commenced by the Plaintiff on 24 November 2020. The Plaintiff’s claim was one for personal injuries arising out of an accident with the Defendant’s motor vehicle which allegedly occurred on 13 August 2019.

6       On 25 July 2021, the Plaintiff filed the present application for a renewal of the writ of summons issued on 24 November 2020 (“**Renewal Application**”). The writ of summons would have expired for service by late May 2021. This Renewal Application was made some two months after the expiry of the writ.

7       When the Renewal Application was first filed, the affidavit filed in support of the application merely stated:

> (a)     The writ of summons was filed on 24 November 2020.[^1]

> (b)     The Plaintiff’s solicitors had attempted to effect personal service of the writ on the Defendant on 24 November 2020 and 5 December 2020, but both attempts were unsuccessful.[^2]

> (c)     The Plaintiff’s solicitors “_also made attempts to reach the Defendant via Registered mail but to no avail_”.[^3]

> (d)     The Plaintiff’s solicitors “_intend to make an application to Court for substituted service_” but needed the writ to be renewed before such application could be made.[^4]

8        The Renewal Application first came before me for a documents-only hearing on 29 July 2021. After reviewing the documents filed, I was of the view that the 1st Affidavit was lacking in detail. In particular, apart from stating the matters outlined at \[7\] above, there was no explanation provided as to _what_ attempts were made between 5 December 2020 and 25 July 2021 (i.e. the date of the Renewal Application) to effect service of the writ on the Defendant, _why_ personal service could not be effected, _why_ an application for substituted service could not have been made and _why_ the Renewal Application could not have been made before the writ expired.

9       Accordingly, I directed the Plaintiff to file a further supplementary affidavit to address these issues, as well as any other issue which the Plaintiff wished to address. The supplementary affidavit (“**2nd Affidavit**”) was filed on 15 August 2021.

10     The 2nd Affidavit, however, raised more questions than it answered. It stated, amongst others:

> (a)     A Memorandum of Service was filed by the Plaintiff on 4 December 2020.[^5]

> (b)     Between 5 December 2020 to 23 March 2021, the Plaintiff and his solicitors “_were engaged by the Defendant’s Supervisor, Dylan Eng, to have the matter settled_”.[^6]

> (c)     A request to enter judgment in default of appearance was made by the Plaintiff on 24 March 2021. However, the request was rejected.[^7]

> (d)     Thereafter, “_an Affidavit to request for substituted service_”[^8] was filed.

> (e)     “_Before_ \[the Plaintiff\] _file_ \[sic\] _the summons for substituted service_”, further attempts were made to effect service of the writ “_by AR Post and personal service_” on 26 April and 27 April 2021.[^9]

> (f)     In May 2021, the Plaintiff attempted to locate the Defendant at “_the Defendant’s office_”, but to no avail.[^10]

## My Decision

11     Having carefully reviewed the matters stated in the 1st and 2nd Affidavits, I dismissed the application on 18 August 2021. I was of the view that the Plaintiff had failed to establish any good reason for renewal of the writ.

### The law

12     The principles applicable to an application to extend the validity of a writ are well settled. Such applications generally involve a two-stage enquiry. At stage one, the court must be satisfied that there is a good reason to extend time, and also that the plaintiff had given a satisfactory explanation for his failure to apply before the validity expired. If the court was so satisfied then it should proceed to stage two and decide whether or not to exercise its discretion in favour of renewal by considering all the circumstances of the case including the balance of prejudice or hardship: see _The “Nur Allya”_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHCR 12</span> at \[36(b)\]. Although “_exceptional circumstances_” are not required, there must nevertheless be “_good reason_” to justify the exercise of a discretion to extend the validity of a writ beyond the appropriate period allowed for its service: see _Singapore Civil Procedure (2021)_, Vol 1, Sweet & Maxwell, at \[6/4/3\].

13     It is also important to be reminded that the discretion to extend the validity of the writ is one which the courts exercise _with caution_. There can be no expectation that renewals will be granted as a matter of course even if applied for _ex parte_. In every case, the court must be satisfied that the renewal will not prejudice any right of defence then existing and good reasons appear to excuse the delay in service. In _Battersby v Anglo-American Oil Co Ltd_ \[1945\] KB 23, Lord Goddard, delivering the judgment of the court, said at 32:

> We conclude by saying that, even when an application for renewal of a writ is made within twelve months of the date of issue, the **jurisdiction given by the rule ought to be exercised with caution**. It is the duty of a plaintiff who issues a writ to serve it promptly, and **renewal is certainly not to be granted as of course on an application which is necessarily made** **_ex parte_**. In every case care should be taken to see that the renewal will not prejudice any right of defence then existing, and in any case **it should only be granted where the court is satisfied that good reasons appear to excuse the delay in service**, as, indeed, is laid down in the order. The best reason, of course, would be that the defendant has been avoiding service, or that his address is unknown, and there may well be others, but ordinarily it is not a good reason that the plaintiff desires to hold up the proceedings while some other case is tried or to await some future development. It is for the court and not for one of the litigants to decide whether there should be a stay, and **it is not right that people should be left in ignorance that proceedings have been taken against them if they are here to be served**.

(emphasis added)

14     In this case, as mentioned, I was not convinced that there was any “_good reason_” to extend the validity of the writ.

### November – December 2020

15     It appeared from the events outlined in the 1st and 2nd Affidavits that the Plaintiff made two initial attempts to serve the writ on the Defendant personally in November and December 2020, but both were unsuccessful. There was also an attempt to serve the writ and SOC on the Defendant by registered post on 5 December 2020, but the address was entered wrongly.[^11] In any event, service by way of registered post would not have constituted personal service on the Defendant pursuant to O 62 r 3 of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed).

### December 2020 – March 2021

16     The Plaintiff then explained that from December 2020 to late March 2021, the Plaintiff (and his solicitors) were engaged in settlement discussions with the “_Defendant’s Supervisor_”[^12] and these settlement discussions “_distracted_” the Plaintiff and the Plaintiff’s solicitors from “_proceeding with the application for substituted service because_ \[they\] _believed that the Defendant was willing to settle the matter_”.[^13]

17     It was not clear to me why the Plaintiff believed that the Defendant’s “_Supervisor_” was authorised to negotiate a settlement on behalf of the Defendant. Neither did the Plaintiff attempt to explain. But even assuming there was such authority, negotiations for a settlement generally do not afford any excuse for failing to serve a writ in time or to renew it before expiry. Even if the Plaintiff was hopeful of an amicable settlement, he must have been aware that there was _no certainty_ of a settlement and the Plaintiff took the risk if the validity of the writ ran out in the meantime.

18     In _Easy v Universal Anchorage Co Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1974\] 1 WLR 899</span>, the plaintiff similarly relied on negotiations for a settlement as a reason for renewal of the writ. This was rejected by the English Court of Appeal. Lord Denning in his judgment stated unequivocally that negotiations for a settlement do not afford any excuse for failing to serve a writ in time or to renew it (at 902):

> **The plaintiff's solicitors are under a duty to their client to serve the writ in time, even though negotiations are in progress.** … **The only principle is that a writ is not to be renewed except for good reason.** That appears from the cases starting with the judgment of Megaw J. in _Heaven v. Road and Rail Wagons Ltd_. <span class="citation">\[1965\] 2 Q.B. 355</span> and followed in this court in _Baker v. Bowketts Cakes Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1966\] 1 W.L.R. 861</span> and _Jones v. Jones_ <span class="citation">\[1970\] 2 Q.B. 576</span>, where Salmon L.J. helpfully summarised all the authorities at p. 582, Karminski L.J. went out of his way to say, at p. 588:

>> "We were told in the course of argument that sometimes writs are not served because, rightly or wrongly, it is thought that it might prejudice the possibilities of a settlement of a claim with the insurance company or underwriters concerned. I find this most difficult to accept as a valid reason. Negotiations for a settlement remain a matter of commercial judgment, and I find it very difficult to accept that the susceptibilities of those who undertake this kind of insurance would be upset by the mere service of a writ on their assured."

> **That is right. Negotiations for a settlement do not afford any excuse for failing to serve a writ in time or to renew it.**

> I am afraid that the solicitors for the plaintiff made a mistake: they knew perfectly well that they ought to have served the writ by August 17, 1973. They did not do it. It was an unfortunate oversight by the Bolton solicitors…. They overlooked the necessity of serving the writ by August 17, 1973. **It is true that negotiations were in progress for a settlement: but that is not a sufficient reason for not serving the writ.**

> I would add that this does not mean that the plaintiff will suffer. He has a remedy against the solicitors. I think the judge was right not to renew the writ. I would dismiss the appeal.

(emphasis added)

19     Accordingly, to the extent that any delay in the service of the writ was attributable to settlement discussions between the Plaintiff and the “_Defendant’s Supervisor_” [^14] between December 2020 to late March 2021, this did not, in my view, constitute good reason to renew the writ particularly when there were still two months remaining on the validity of the writ when the negotiations allegedly broke down.

### Late March 2021 – May 2021

20     When the alleged settlement discussions proved not fruitful, the Plaintiff attempted to enter default judgment against the Defendant on 24 March 2021. That request for default judgment to be entered was rejected by the court because personal service of the writ was not effected on the Defendant.[^15]

21     Thereafter, it _appeared_ that the Plaintiff _intended_ to make an application for substituted service. I say that “_appeared_” to be the case, because the Court records showed that on 8 April 2021, the Plaintiff’s solicitor filed an affidavit seeking leave to “_allow the Plaintiff’s request to serve the Writ of Summons and the Statement of Claim by substituted service_”.[^16] However, no _application_ for substituted service was filed and the proposed mode of “_substituted service_” was also not specified in the April Affidavit. 

22     After the April Affidavit was filed, and perhaps operating under a misguided impression that leave for substituted service had already been obtained, the Plaintiff attempted to effect “_service_” of the writ on the Defendant by registered post and also by posting a copy of the writ of summons and statement of claim on the Defendant’s “_unit door_” on 26 and 27 April 2021 respectively. Thereafter, on 29 April 2021, the Plaintiff filed a Memorandum of Service, stating that service of the writ of summons was effected on the Defendant on 27 April 2021 through “\[s\]_ubstituted service by pasting on the Defendant’s unit door and by AR Registered post_”.[^17] The truth was that the Plaintiff never made any application for substituted service. Neither was any such order made. How the Plaintiff could have been so misconceived was difficult to comprehend, particularly since the Plaintiff was at all times legally represented and the procedure for applying for substituted service was neither complex nor novel.

23     Despite the opportunities given, the Plaintiff did not attempt to explain why the application for substituted service or the Renewal Application could not have been made earlier. In this case, I found the lack of explanation particularly of concern because the Plaintiff’s own evidence was that in May 2021, the Plaintiff took _further_ steps to locate the Defendant at the Defendant’s “_office_”, but these attempts were unsuccessful.[^18] This renewed attempt to locate the Defendant in May 2021 suggested to me that by then, the Plaintiff _must have realised that the earlier “substituted service” of the writ was not valid_. Yet, despite this and knowing that the validity of the writ was soon expiring, the Plaintiff did not take any step to renew the validity of the writ until the present Renewal Application was filed some _two months later_ in July 2021. The Plaintiff gave no explanations for the delay.

24     Accordingly, I was not convinced that there were good reasons for the delay in effecting service of the writ after the alleged settlement negotiations ended. To the extent that such delay was caused by any misguided belief that the Plaintiff had already obtained leave to effect substituted service, I did not think this could have constituted good reason, because it was simply unreasonable to hold such belief. Further, the Plaintiff must have realised by May 2021 that the writ had not yet been validly served on the Defendant, and instead of acting promptly to renew the validity of the writ, the Plaintiff chose to let the writ expire through inaction. I was unable to discern any good reason to renew the writ.

## Conclusion

25     On the totality of the evidence before me, I accept that the Plaintiff had attempted to effect service of the writ on the Defendant on a number of occasions. That alone, however, was not a “_good reason_” to extend the validity of the writ. The law is clear that where there has been delay, it is incumbent on solicitors to act with all expedition. If the solicitors allow a writ to remain unserved right up to the end of the time limit, and they overlook the date of the writ’s expiry, the validity of the writ will not be extended: see _Singapore Civil Procedure (2021)_, Vol 1, Sweet & Maxwell, at \[6/4/4\], citing _Doble v Haymills (Contractors) Ltd._ (1988) 132 SJ 1063.

26     Lastly, I would add that it was of some concern to me that the Plaintiff did not disclose, in the 1st Affidavit, his unsuccessful attempt at entering default judgment against the Defendant, as well as the existence of the April Affidavit. These events were only disclosed in the 2nd Affidavit, in response to directions from the Court to elaborate on the previous attempts at service. Even then, they were not properly explained or accounted for. It should be remembered that an application for renewal of a writ of summons is ultimately an _ex parte_ application and the requirement of full and frank disclosure applies, even if it may not be applied with the same stringency as it is for some other applications: see _The “Lircay”_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 1 SLR(R) 699</span> at \[24\]. Even so, I would have expected these earlier procedural steps to have been clearly outlined in the 1st Affidavit, with a full explanation as to why the writ could not have been served earlier. That having been said, since these matters were eventually disclosed in the 2nd Affidavit and I had in any event dismissed the Renewal Application, there was no need for me to consider any issue of non-disclosure on this occasion.

27     For the reasons above, the Renewal Application was dismissed. Since this was an _ex-parte_ application and I did not require the attendance of the Defendant, no order was made as to costs for this application.
