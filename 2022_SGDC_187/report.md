Criminal law – Offence – Rash act – Section 304A(a) Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008)

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9034/2022/01-02.\]

22 August 2022

### District Judge Kaur Jasvender:

1       The accused was the Vehicle Commander of the Land Rover MID 33299 (‘Land Rover’) of which full-time national serviceman Corporal First Class Liu Kai (‘deceased’) was its driver. The gravamen of the allegation in the charge under s 304A(a) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008) is that the accused is responsible for the death as his decision to order the deceased to overtake the Bionix Infantry Fighting Vehicle (‘Bionix’) MID 63618 with call sign 13 (‘BX13’) was rash because it was unsafe not to keep to the safety distance of 30 meters without first having established communications due to the real risk that BX13 would be engaged in a ‘fire fight’ and consequently execute an extrication drill, and that the risk eventuated when BX13 reversed as a consequence of the extrication drill and mounted the deceased’s side of the Land Rover which resulted in his death.

2       I was satisfied that the charge was established beyond a reasonable doubt, and the accused was accordingly found guilty and convicted. He was sentenced to five months’ imprisonment. The accused has appealed against that conviction and sentence. The Public Prosecutor sought a sentence of nine months’ imprisonment and has cross-appealed against the sentence.

## Established factual background

3       The incident occurred on 3 November 2018, in the middle of a three-day military exercise (‘the Exercise’) at the Tracked Vehicle Maneuver Area (‘the training area’) near Sungei Gedong Camp. The Exercise involved the Kaffir Company and a platoon from the Jaguar Company from the 42nd Battalion, Singapore Armoured Regiment.

4       The mission of the Kaffir Company was to advance from the North of the training area and secure an objective known as the Murai Urban Training Facility (‘MUTF’) in the South of the training area. A platoon from Jaguar Company led by Platoon Commander Second Lieutenant Nathaniel Ho Chang Han (‘2LT Ho’) acted as the ‘opposition force’ (“the OPFOR”). The OPFOR was tasked to delay the advance of Kaffir Company towards the MUTF and to defend the MUTF. The Kaffir Company deployed 11 Bionix vehicles and the OPFOR deployed three Bionix vehicles in the Exercise.

5       The OPFOR’s plan was to defend by positioning one Bionix vehicle each at the Western, Central and Eastern sectors near strategic junctions along axes, which were called ‘delay lines’. There were four delay lines planned to coordinate between the vehicles. At the delay points, the OPFOR would await possible Kaffir Company forces and engage them in ‘fire fights’.

6       The first delay line was along the Winter Axis, with BX13B positioned near E25, BX13 near to F22 and BX13A near F19. BX13A was ‘destroyed’ at this first delay line during its engagement in a ‘fire fight’ with the Kaffir Company. Thereafter, the remaining two OPFOR Bionix vehicles continued to delay the Kaffir Company. The second delay line was planned near to F87 along the Jaguar axis for BX13B and F28 along Malcom 1 axis for BX13. The third delay line for BX13B was along the Jaguar axis and along Wira axis near to F40 for BX13. The last delay line, which was named ‘Line Odysseus’ by 2LT Ho, was at F65 before F64B for BX13B and along the Honda axis from F63 leading to F64B for BX13.

7       The only junction which led to MUTF was F64B and the axes which provided access to F64B were Sunny 1, Ferrari, Nissan, Lada and Honda.

### The accused’s role in the exercise

8       The accused held the rank of Captain and the appointment of a Platoon Trainer with the Armour Unit Training Centre (“AUTC”), Armour Training Institute. He was tasked to be the trainer for OPFOR for the Exercise. He was briefed on OPFOR’s plans before the exercise by 2LT Ho.

9       His role required him to move around the training area in a Land Rover to observe and provide feedback on the performance of the Vehicle Commanders of the OPFOR’s three Bionix vehicles, to ensure safety procedures were adhered to and to act as arbiter in determining the outcome of any ‘fire fight’ that he observed. The accused was able to communicate with the OPFOR Bionix vehicles through his in-vehicle radio signal set.

10     The accused was the Vehicle Commander of the Land Rover in which he and the deceased were. As the Commander of the vehicle, he was responsible to ensure the safety of the deceased who was the driver.

### Events at the first and second delay lines

11     The accused testified that he advised 2LT Ho at F28 to point BX13’s turret towards the Eastern sector instead of North-West to cover the gap left by the ‘destruction’ of BX13A. 2LT Ho agreed that the accused had approached him at one point during the Exercise but he was no longer able to remember at which delay point it was and the conversation due to the passage of more than two years.

12     It was also the accused’s evidence that he saw BX13B in close proximity to F28 at that stage when he spoke to 2LT Ho. He said he advised 2LT Ho that the two Bionix vehicles should not be positioned closely. There was a conflict in evidence on whether BX13B was in fact in close proximity to F28, as the accused claimed. According to Third Sergeant Koh Chong Min (‘3SG Koh’), who was the Vehicle Commander of BX13B, he started off at his first assigned delay point near to E25, and moved down the Jaguar axis to the second delay point near F87.

13     The accused claimed that BX13B was still in the ‘vicinity of F28’ after he spoke to 2LT Ho. I found it hard to accept that BX13B would have remained in the ‘vicinity of F28’ if the accused had indeed pointed out that their distance was too close. More significantly, 3SG Koh and 2LT Ho were certain that they were defending at their planned delay points in the Western and Central sectors respectively. It did not make sense for 3SG Koh to leave the Western sector unguarded and to move down to F28. Further, if BX13B had moved down to F28, it would have had to move up North again to return to the Western sector in order to proceed down along the Jaguar axis. This too is illogical. Moreover, the audio transcript supports that 3SG Koh was moving according to the plan along the Jaguar axis. At 09:42:37, 2LT Ho said “_If necessary you might need to move to the second position that I told you as well, the (unclear)_”. 2LT Ho explained that the ‘second position’ referred to the third delay position around F42 and F43 near the Jaguar axis. At 09:51:39, 3SG Koh replied that he had already stopped there. Accordingly, I rejected the evidence of the accused that he saw BX13B at the vicinity of F28. I accepted the evidence of 2LT Ho that he did not see BX13B in the vicinity of F28 and 3SG Koh’s evidence that he travelled according to the planned route from delay points E25 to F87.

### Events at the third delay line

14     Turning now to the third delay line. There is no dispute that BX13 was positioned along the Wira axis near F40 and facing North. The accused was adjacent to F40. He was along the Toyota axis between F40 and F41 (at what appears to be a marking ‘11’ on the map P7) and facing East. The accused’s evidence is that he believed BX13B was at around F43 in the West at this juncture, according to its planned delay point.

15     After about 15 minutes, at 09:48:44, 2LT Ho instructed BX13B to pull back to line Odysseus because he gauged the enemy vehicles were very close based on the Bionix engine noises that he heard. He informed 3SG Koh that BX13 was also pulling back.

16     2LT Ho was familiar with the route to the last delay line at F64B. BX13 made a U-turn in order to travel down South. It took the Nissan axis at F53 to travel to F54. It slowed down before F54 upon seeing a Bionix ahead at the F63 junction. It came to a stop at about 09:51:40. About six seconds later (about 09:51:46), the Land Rover stopped at a distance of about 30 to 31 meters behind BX13. At 09:52:07, the accused instructed the deceased to drive the Land Rover forward and to overtake BX13. As the deceased was moving forward, at 09:52:11, gunshots were fired. Upon hearing the gunshots, the deceased stopped the Land Rover. This final position was about 16 to 18 metres from BX13. At 09:52:19, BX13 began to reverse as part of an extrication drill. At 09:52:27, BX13 reversed into the Land Rover and partially mounted it before coming to a stop.

## Evidence of prosecution’s witnesses

17     I summarise below the salient aspects of the evidence of the 13 witnesses for the prosecution.

### Evidence of PW1 – Captain Wan Hong Wee (‘CPT Wan’)

18     CPT Wan is a SAF regular since 2011. In November 2018, he was attached to the Armour Training Institute. He was the conducting officer for the Exercise.

19     He testified that the Kaffir Company and the OPFOR obtained approval for their respective plans on how to achieve their objectives before the start of the Exercise. He said the accused would have been aware of the broad plans of both sides. He stated the trainers conducted a table-top exercise of Kaffir’s plan during which the locations where the firefights were expected to occur, the different scenarios and training objectives were discussed. He said a trainer must have situational awareness in order to position himself at critical junctions to perform his role. He agreed under cross-examination that the Vehicle Commanders had the flexibility to decide on how to advance Southwards.

20     CPT Wan briefed the participants on certain safety aspects. He stated a safety distance of 30 meters is required to be maintained with an armoured vehicle and the onus is on the rear vehicle to adhere to the safety distance. The rationale for the safety distance is to prevent collisions as the distance provides for reaction time.

21     As a junction connects various axes, he said it poses a potential danger to the Bionix, as it may encounter an enemy vehicle or obstacle and there may also be blind spots. He was asked[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1):

> Q    So, following on from what you’ve told us, in a combat movement, what does it mean when a BX, a Bionix vehicle that is moving stops completely before a junction and points its turret towards that junction? What does that mean?

> A    Mmm, there might be a possibility of that Bionix expecting enemy vehicles approaching or he stopped to observe what’s in front of them or possibly he spotted some other things at the junction.

22     As regards overtaking, he stated the specific rule provides that there must be a two metre space between the overtaking vehicle and the static stationary armoured vehicle. As regards what the overtaking vehicle must do, he gave the following evidence in examination-in-chief[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2):

> 
| 

Q

 | 

So, if a vehicle is behind an armoured vehicle and that vehicle wants to overtake the armoured vehicle in front, what are the steps that the overtaking vehicle should do to safely carry out the overtake?

 |
| 

A

 | 

In my opinion, I will try to make contact with the vehicle or the vehicle commander that is in front of me before overtaking. If the area is big enough, I will make my vehicle---I will command my vehicle to ensure that, um, there is sufficient space by the side before I overtake.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Okay.

 |
| 

A

 | 

And some oth---some of the ways that can make---you can make contact with the vehicle commander in front of you is possibly horn, wave or comms them.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Sorry, horn, wave or?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Um, communicate via the vehicle comms set.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Includes radio?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Radio set, correct.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And why would you do that?

 |
| 

A

 | 

To---

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Why would you establish contact first?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Um, the purpose is to inform him of your intention of overtaking.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And why is it important to inform the vehicle in front of your intent to overtake?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, I think it is similar to driving your civilian car on the road. When you, um, want to overtake someone, you make sure that the vehicle in front of you isn’t turning out, just in case.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, what would---what sort of scenarios would communicating the intent to overtake prevent?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, prevent the vehicle from turning out and---and colliding into you or possibly, the vehicle might---might reverse.

 |

  
  

23     Under cross-examination, he agreed that the Training Safety Regulations do not require communication to be established before overtaking. He agreed the accused could have overtaken the Bionix without communicating his intention to do so if it was safe. In re-examination, he elaborated that safety is the paramount consideration in any decision to overtake and the Vehicle Commander must act with caution and assess whether the stationary Bionix may reverse, or other vehicles may come from the opposite direction. He gave the following evidence[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3):

> Q    A related area is about establishing communications, right, with the vehicle ahead. You said that there is no provision in the TSR stating this but earlier on when I questioned you, you said that this is something you would do, you would establish contact whether through signalling, horning, or communications, correct?

> A    That’s right.

> Q    Okay. Why would you do that? Why is that something you would do?

> A    To---I’ll do that to make my intention clear. And also, if I’m overtaking a static vehicle, I’m not sure what is ahead of me, there might be a vehicle that is coming in the opposite direction. That is why I would prefer to horn, um, when overtaking.

> …

> Q    My follow-up question for you is, if the situation on the ground is actually unsafe, right, if there is actually a risk that the static armoured vehicle may move, then should the overtaking vehicle establish contact like you said you would do?

> A    I will do that if I can ascertain---ascertain and assess that there is possibility of, uh, any dangers.

> Q    And why would you do that even though it’s not stated---explicitly stated in the TRS that this is something you must do?

> A    I would do that for the safety of myself and also, um, whichever passengers or people that is on board of the vehicle that I’m in.

24     Asked what steps a Bionix vehicle was expected to take on seeing an enemy vehicle approaching, he said the Vehicle Commander will command the driver to stop, reverse, direct the gunner to return fire and reverse out of the danger area. He said due to the urgency, the steps of this drill must be carried out immediately. However, he said the reversing and firing can occur simultaneously. He was asked by the DPP[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4):

> Q    And what about a situation where the BX, who has spotted an enemy ahead, first fires at the enemy vehicle. What would that vehicle need to do afterwards?

> A    After firing, you have to reverse.

> Q    And similarly, are the---is this expected to be carried out quickly---immediately?

> A    Yes, Your Honour.

Under cross-examination, he stated that he was not in a position to answer if the Bionix can fire first before reversing as he is not from the training institute.

25     He stated the Bionix crew wear a CVC helmet which allows for internal communications amongst the crew and outward communications over the same radio frequency within their own Company. He agreed it was normal to have intermittent messages. He stated the accused’s in-vehicle radio set would have been tuned to the OPFOR frequency and he would have been able to hear the messages exchanged between the OPFOR Bionix vehicles. In addition, the accused had a TRS device, which operated like a walkie-talkie between the conducting officers and the trainers. He said all trainers were expected to monitor their in-vehicle radio set and the TRS to have situational awareness of the progress of the Exercise. He stated the trainees will seldom contact the trainer, but the trainer may contact the trainees to give his observations or prompters, to check on what they are going to do next, et cetera. However, he said the trainer would tend to minimise communication.

26     He agreed that Clause 32 of the TSR states that when reversing an Armoured Fighting Vehicle (‘AFV’), a rear guide is required. The rear guide is supposed to guide the driver while reversing because the driver is unable to see what is behind the vehicle. He disagreed that the driver had to check with the rear guide before he can start to reverse. He said that in 2018, the drill and command was driver stop, driver reverse, section commander guide, gunner return fire. He stated that the driver can reverse upon the command to reverse.

### Evidence of PW2 – Vincent Chua Zheng An (‘3SG Chua’)

27     3SG Chua was serving his full-time national service and participated in the Exercise as part of the OPFOR team. He was the Vehicle Commander of BX13A which was tasked to defend the Eastern sector. BX13’s first delay point was at F19.

28     He testified that on spotting an enemy Bionix, his vehicle was required to fire immediately and reverse as fast as possible to get out of the line of sight of the enemy to avoid being destroyed. He said that if the Bionix cannot get a good position to fire at the enemy, it can reverse first and then fire. Whilst 3SG Chua was at F19, he saw two enemy vehicles coming down from the North. He stated that his Bionix fired, but it was ambushed by infantry troopers from Kaffir Company. He informed 2LT Ho that his Bionix has been destroyed. The accused instructed him to proceed to the ‘revive’ point.

29     He communicated with his Platoon Commander, 2LT Ho, via the CVC helmet. He explained the CVC helmet has two functions; one is to radio out to communicate with 2LT Ho, the Vehicle Commander of BX13B and the trainers, and the other is to communicate internally with the crew of the Bionix via the intercom system. As regards the quality of the communication via the CVC helmet, he stated that there is static noise but the communication can be heard clearly.

30     With respect to overtaking, he said that he would radio the Vehicle Commander of the vehicle in front to inform him that he intends to overtake regardless of whether the vehicle is moving or static. He said it was a good practice to communicate to ensure that the vehicle does not suddenly stop, move or swerve. He said he was taught about the need to establish communication before overtaking in Armour Training School.

31     Asked how he approached a junction, he said the Bionix would slow down and point its weapon system either from left to right or from right to left and ensure that there is no enemy before speeding up. He stated it is ‘too dangerous’ to stop at a junction and he would only do so if he encountered an enemy, obstacle or he had reached a designated delay point. As regards how he stopped at a designated delay point, he said that he tried to conceal the Bionix and pointed the weapon system to the North.

### Evidence of PW3 – Koh Chong Min (‘3SG Koh’)

32     3SG Koh was serving his national service and was in the OPFOR team for the Exercise. He was the Vehicle Commander of BX13B. He testified that the delay points of BX13B were in the western sector, of BX13 in the Central sector and of BX13A in the eastern sector.

33     BX13B’s first delay point was at E25. He did not encounter any enemy vehicle there. He next moved to the second delay point at F87 on 2LT Ho’s instruction. He then moved onto the third delay line which was at the intersection of the Jaguar and Fuji axis. He did not spot any enemy at the second and third delay line. Thereafter, he moved down to the fourth delay point. He was unable to recall where precisely he stopped. He said that he moved down the Jaguar axis towards the Honda axis. He was finally instructed by 2LT Ho to proceed to F64B.

34     Whilst he was making his way down to F64B, 2LT Ho asked him through the CVC if his Bionix (BX13B) was in front of him (2LT Ho). 3SG Koh replied that he could not see him. BX13B continued to make its way down and reached F64B in less than five minutes. BX13B parked south of F64B and pointed the turret North to defend the junction into which vehicles would enter to proceed to MUTF. Shortly, he saw two or three enemy vehicles along the Honda axis from the direction of F63 and F64. He stated that BX13B fired as soon as he saw an incoming Bionix. Soon thereafter, there were instructions to stop the Exercise.

35     Asked how his Bionix approached a junction, he said that it would slow down to check if there were any oncoming vehicles. Asked if the Bionix would stop at a junction, he said that it would only do so to allow an oncoming vehicle to pass, if there was an obstacle, or if he encountered an enemy. In cross-examination, he agreed there may sometimes be a need to stop the Bionix to assess the surroundings.

36     As regards overtaking, he stated that if he were in a non-armoured vehicle and intended to overtake a Bionix, he would establish communication with the Vehicle Commander to inform him that he will be passing through. He said he would do this for his safety to avoid a crash because vehicles can move rapidly during an Exercise. He stated that the TSR provides for a two metre safety distance to overtake a static vehicle but he would not do so if it was unsafe despite there being such a distance.

37     In cross-examination, he disagreed that BX13B was near to F28. He disagreed that BX13B was within sight of BX13 near F28.

### Evidence of PW4 – Gibson Tay (‘LT Gibson’)

38     LT Gibson was serving his national service in 2018. He held the appointment of Platoon Commander. He was in the Kaffir Company for the Exercise. He was the Vehicle Commander of BX22. The two other Bionix vehicles under his command were BX22A and BX22B.

39     LT Gibson identified the junctions at E24, F19 and F64B to be of strategic importance to advance to MUTF. He said his Bionix would slow down upon approaching a junction in order to have a better look around and turn its turret to make the check. He said he would only give a command to stop at a junction if he were to see a vehicle, object or enemy. If an enemy was sighted, he would direct the driver to stop, reverse, and the gunner would then fire. He explained that reversing is done immediately and the firing is done concurrently. He stated that it is in order to fire first before reversing.

40     With respect to overtaking an armoured vehicle, he said the overtaking of a moving armoured vehicle is prohibited. As regards a static armoured vehicle, he said there must be a two metre clearance between the vehicles and it is also necessary to communicate via the CVC to inform the vehicle. He explained the communication is necessary for safety so that the vehicle will remain stationary. He was taught to establish communication in the Armour Officer Cadet School.

41     As regards the Exercise, he said that BX22, BX22A and BX22B started from F13. LT Gibson dismounted and walked with his troopers down to F25. He then walked up North as he spotted an enemy vehicle at F19. He asked his troopers to fire at the enemy vehicle. After the enemy vehicle was destroyed, BX22, BX22A and BX22B travelled down from F13 along the Hyundai axis to F14, F17 and to F19 where LT Gibson boarded BX22. He stated that his Bionix was ahead and it travelled along the Nissan axis to F25 and then to F29. Thereafter, it travelled along the Rado axis to F38 and proceeded down to F39. Next, it proceeded down the Ferrari axis to F50 and turned left to Daewoo axis. At F49, it travelled down Sunny 1 to F62. At F62, BX22 turned right and proceeded along Honda axis towards F64B. He said there was a plan for Kaffir Company to link up at F64B. Along the way, LT Gibson heard gunshots to his right (on the side of Sharon-Jasmine in P7). BX22 continued to travel to F64B and spotted an enemy vehicle at F64B. LT Gibson directed his gunner to fire at the enemy vehicle. After the gunner stopped, LT Gibson received a radio message that the Exercise was cut.

42     Under cross-examination, LT Gibson said he was unaware if any of the OPFOR’s Bionix vehicle travelled along the Ferrari axis to proceed to F63. He agreed that he was unable to see junctions F54 and F53 from F63. He said this was due to the curvature in the axis and vegetation which blocked the view.

43     Asked how it is ensured that it is safe for a Bionix to reverse, he said that the rear guide will take charge and ensure that it is safe to do so. Asked if he would stop the Bionix at a junction to assess the surroundings, he said that he would not. He said that in an Exercise, the Bionix would not stop at a junction unless there is an obstacle or there is presence of the enemy.

### Evidence of PW5 – Chua Jin Yuan (‘CPT Chua’)

44     CPT Chua is a regular in the SAF and was the Officer Commanding of Kaffir Company for the Exercise.

45     He confirmed that there was a briefing prior to the start of the Exercise on some safety pointers. He said the safety distance of 30 meters to be maintained between vehicles was mentioned. He said the safety distance applies to vehicles when they are travelling along the same axis, regardless of whether they are travelling in a straight line or in a staggered manner. He said the intent of the rule is to allow the front vehicle to have sufficient space to manoeuvre and to reverse.

46     As regards how a Bionix approaches a junction, he stated that it will deliberately slow down to check if there is any vehicle on the other axes. He stated that a Bionix will come to a complete stop at a junction only if it spots an enemy vehicle or if it was lost.

47     For the Exercise, he had 11 Bionix vehicles under his charge. He deployed BX23, 23A and 23B in the Western sector. He stated the plan for the Bionix vehicles in the West was to travel down from E02 along the Volvo axis towards E24 and E25 and to split at F21, with two Bionix vehicles travelling down Jaguar to F64B, and one along the Malcolm axis to F28, and the other to Nissan, Fuji to reach F64B. CPT Chua did not know what was the actual movement of the Bionix vehicles in the West during the Exercise.

48     He said that BX22, 22A and 22B were deployed in the Eastern sector. CPT Chua was in Bionix 29 and he kept to the rear of the three Bionix vehicles in the East. He was aware that one enemy Bionix was destroyed at F19. He said the three Bionix vehicles in front of him travelled from F19 to F25 along Nissan to F29 and thereafter along Rado and split at F38. CPT Chua’s Bionix proceeded to F36 and travelled down Onion and turned into Daewoo to F49. It then proceeded down Sunny 1 to F62. He stated that shortly after it took a turn at F62 into the Honda axis and was near to F63, he saw an OPFOR Bionix at the area between F64B and F64. CPT Chua stopped his Bionix and communicated with BX22, 22A and 22B to proceed to his location. About two to three minutes later, the three Bionix vehicles reached his location and overtook to proceed to destroy the OPFOR Bionix. He did not hear if there was any firing. Shortly, he received communication via his CVC that the Exercise has ceased.

49     With respect to overtaking an armoured vehicle, he stated the first step is always to establish communication with the vehicle that one intends to overtake in order that the vehicle will remain stationary when it is being overtaken, and the overtaking vehicle should keep to the two metre clearance when bypassing. He stated that establishing communication is a safety practice which he has been exposed to during his training in 2013 to 2014. He was asked under cross-examination[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5):

> Q    So, you would agree that if it is safe to overtake and---and you can overtake by a margin of at least 2 metres, you can proceed to overtake without communicating your intention to the front vehicle?

> A    So, that was not what I was, uh, briefed and taught in the unit.

> …

> Q    The question is, if it s---if it is safe to overtake and you are able to overtake by keeping a margin or distance of at least 2 metres, then you can proceed to overtake without communicating with the front vehicle.

> A    I---I think the pre-requisite to this question is that how do you think that it’s safe if there is no communications, yah. So, to me as my personal opinion is that communication is, uh---uh, is a vital thing to establish before overtaking take place.

50     On seeing an enemy vehicle, a standard extrication drill is executed whereby the Vehicle Commander would give the command of driver stop, driver reverse and gunner fire. The section commander or side machine gunner guide would then start to guide the vehicle reverse. He agreed that a change was made to the extrication drill after November 2018 with the key difference being that the rear guide (section commander or the side MG commander) must give a confirmation that he has received the order and he is guiding before the driver can reverse.

### Evidence of PW 6 – Nathaniel Ho Chong Han (‘2LT Ho’)

51     2LT Ho was serving his national service in 2018. He was the Platoon Commander of the OPFOR for the Exercise. He was also the Vehicle Commander of BX13. The two vehicles under his command had the call signs 13A and 13B.

52     He assigned BX13B to guard the Western sector, BX13A to be at the Eastern sector and his own BX13 was at the Central sector. He briefed his platoon and the accused on the plan to delay the Kaffir Company forces. He said the accused’s role as a trainer was to move around in a Land Rover to observe the OPFOR and provide feedback to the Vehicle Commanders via the CVC helmet. He showed the accused the map of the Exercise area and briefed him on how the OPFOR intended to conduct the Exercise. The three key strategic locations identified where the Bionix vehicles will take positions to defend at were E25, F19 and F64B.

53     BX13 was driven by CPL Lim Hao Hun (‘CPL Lim’). BX13’s first delay line was at F22, the second delay line was at F28, the third delay line was at F40, and the final position was to be at F64B along the fourth delay line named line Odysseus. The side machine gunner on BX13 was 3SG Tay Cheng Jun (‘3SG Tay’) who had two roles. The first was to man the side machine gun. The second was to aid in reversal manoeuvres.

54     The OPFOR’s plan was to defend by engaging in fire fights at the junctions at which they were stationary. If they were to encounter the Kaffir Company whilst on the move, the plan was to fire and conduct an extrication drill to get out of the enemy’s line of sight and to give a SITREP to the commander. 2LT Ho explained that SITREP is a report to update the commander on the situation. He stated the orders in an extrication drill are given in one go because speed is essential. He said the driver can start reversing immediately once the order is given. The side MG would then immediately take over the reverse guiding and the driver would stop upon hearing the stop command from the side MG gunner if there was an obstacle.

55     As regards the CVC helmet, he said it has an intercom and radio function. 2LT Ho explained that when the radio function is used, he is unable to hear what is said via the intercom between the crew. He said it is normal for the radio and intercom functions to encounter static noises and at times the communication may be cut off a little or there is a gap. He said that if the intercom were to fail to function, the Bionix will not move until the communications is working.

56     He said an equipment check was done on the night before the Exercise and everything was in order. On the day of the incident, another check was done prior to the start of the Exercise on the vehicle’s functionality and communication. He said the intercoms was checked first by all crew members wearing their CVC helmets and speaking to ensure that everyone is able to hear each other. For radio, 2LT Ho checked that he is able to communicate with 13B, 13A, 19, and 13T. He said there was no issue with the communications.

57     As regards the safe distance between vehicles, he said the safety distance of 30 metres applies to armoured vehicles and armoured and non-armoured vehicles. Asked what he would do if he intends to overtake during an Exercise, he said that he would inform the Vehicle Commander of the front vehicle of his intention to overtake because he would not know if the vehicle would remain stationary or move. He said he learnt of the need to communicate the intention to overtake when he was undergoing training at the Armour Training Institute.

58     Asked what action is taken when approaching a junction, he said the Bionix will slow down before the junction and he will turn the turret to ensure that the junction is clear of obstacles or vehicles before crossing and picking up speed.

59     As regards the Exercise proper, 2LT Ho was informed by BX13A that it has been destroyed at F19. 2LT Ho then moved to the second delay line at F28. He also requested BX13B to move to its second delay line at F87. He said the OPFOR was no longer able to defend the Eastern sector with the destruction of BX13A. In cross-examination, he disagreed that BX13B was somewhere at F28. Asked if he recalled that the accused approached him at F28 to tell him that the Bionix vehicles should not be so close, he said he was unable to remember such a conversation. He said that BX13B’s second delay point was at F87.

60     After some time, 2LT Ho moved down to the third delay line at F40. He instructed BX13B to do likewise. He said that BX13B moved down to the Jaguar and Fuji junction. 2LT Ho was referred to the transcript (exh P4) of his communication with BX13B. He said he heard vehicle noises whilst he was at F40 and he informed BX13B to get ready to pull back to the next delay line, and if necessary, he might have to move to F43. About four minutes later, 2LT Ho informed BX13B that he heard an enemy vehicle that is most likely approaching its direction. 2LT Ho said that he could ‘roughly hear some Bionix engine noises’ and it seemed to him that the noise was in the West. BX13B replied it was at the point it was asked to move to. About two minutes later, 2LT Ho heard the engine of a Bionix which he gauged was quite close. He believed that BX13B was around F43 at that point. He immediately told BX13B to pull back to the last delay line, line Odysseus. 2LT Ho then travelled down Wira axis, and at F53, he took the Nissan axis and proceeded towards F54. Whilst he was in the vicinity of F54, he asked BX13B where it was. BX13B’s reply was received only in part as ‘(unclear) line Odysseus’. 2LT Ho then asked BX13B if it was being chased, and the reply was ‘Negative. Negative’. 2LT Ho then asked BX13B if it had stopped at the secondary point of the third delay line. BX13B replied that it had and it was retrograding all the way back to line Odysseus.

61     2LT Ho was shown the footage of BX13 before the junction of 54. He said at the time stamp of 00:11:36, the vehicle was still moving but slowing down to a halt. He said BX13 eventually stopped because he was surprised to see a Bionix travelling at the junction ahead from left to right. 2LT Ho then messaged BX13B to ask if it was the Bionix he had seen. BX13B replied that he did not see BX13. Soon thereafter, 2LT Ho saw more Bionix vehicles crossing ahead. He then concluded that they were from Kaffir Company.

62     2LT Ho immediately executed the extrication drill. He ordered the gunner to fire at the Bionix vehicles and gave the command to reverse. He thereafter started giving a situational report to BX19.

63     After he had reported over the radio to BX19, he heard 3SG Tay shouting “Stop” repeatedly and frantically over the intercom. 2LT Ho instinctively shouted “Stop” into the intercom as well. One to two seconds later, BX13 mounted something and stopped. 2LT Ho then propped himself out of the Vehicle Commander’s hatch and saw the Bionix was on top of the Land Rover.

64     As to how the intercommunications was working, he said it was working well. He said he was communicating with the driver. He was asked[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6):

> Q    Okay. And finally, at---at F54 just before F54 here when you were executing the extrication drill, how was your intercoms?

> A    I would say that it was fine as well because I---because I gave the command to Zhao Yong to fire and he did. And then when I gave the command to reverse Jun Hao did as well.

65     Under cross-examination, 2LT Ho said he is sure that he heard the rear guide shouting stop through the intercom. Asked if there was any other way to tell the driver to stop if he could not be reached via the CVC, he said it was via the ehorn which is located at the bottom of the Vehicle Commander’s hatch or via a button to cut off the engine power. However, he said communication via the CVC helmet was the most effective method.

66     As regards the discretion given to the driver, he said the default driving direction is straight without any command when driving forward or reversing. He said it is not unusual for a Bionix to have a drift. If there is a minor drift, the driver will correct it, but if it were to adversely affect the performance or make the vehicle hard to drive, the driver will report it and stop the vehicle.

67     Asked if the driver had to ensure the reverse was clear before reversing, he said the driver can reverse immediately upon command and the side MG will immediately help to check if the rear is clear of obstacles for the vehicle to continue moving and guide the reversal.

### Evidence of PW7 – Corporal Chan Zhao Yong (‘CPL Chan’)

68     CPL Chan was performing his national service when he was involved in the training exercise as part of the OPFOR team. He was under the command of 2LT Ho and was the gunner for BX13. His role was to man the turret to scan for enemy forces. Upon spotting any enemy forces, he was required to inform 2LT Ho. He would fire at the enemy only if he was instructed to do so by 2LT Ho.

69     CPL Chan communicated with the crew of BX13 through intercom via the CVC helmet. He stated the crew were required to perform a check to ascertain if the CVC intercom function was working at the start of each day of the Exercise. In order to make the check, each crew member was required to wear their CVC helmet and speak to test if they could hear each other via the intercom function. This check was done on the day of the incident and it was determined that all the CVC helmets were functioning. Thereafter, the Bionix vehicles moved off to begin the Exercise. He stated the intercom was functioning throughout prior to the accident.

70     CPL Chan testified that as he was approaching a junction, he spotted a Bionix vehicle ahead through the scope of the turret which was moving from his left to right. He informed 2LT Ho about what he saw. 2LT Ho told him that he would check with BX13B if it was their vehicle. CPL Chan heard BX13B replying that it was not their vehicle. Shortly, CPL Chan saw more Bionix vehicles moving from left to right. His estimate was that there were more than three vehicles. He informed 2LT Ho that he spotted more vehicles in front. He was then immediately instructed by 2LT Ho to fire one burst of three rounds. Thereafter, 2LT Ho asked CPL Lim to reverse the Bionix.

71     After CPL Chan had fired, he started to fix the ‘rainbow chute’. In the process of doing so, he heard several ‘stop’ commands through his CVC helmet. He heard 3SG Tay, 2LT Ho and the accused saying ‘stop’ through his CVC. He felt the Bionix had mounted onto something which he presumed was the side hump of the axis. The Bionix then came to stop. He did not know at that stage that an accident had happened.

72     In cross-examination, he said that he was not able to communicate via radio. Asked how he was able to allegedly hear the accused saying stop through radio, he explained it was because his communication was set to radio and he could therefore hear the communication of the allied vehicles and of the accused.

### Evidence of PW8 – Corporal Lim Hao Jun (‘CPL Lim’)

73     CPL Lim was performing his national service when he took part in the Exercise. He was the driver of BX13. He had operated a Bionix for about one year prior to the incident.

74     His role was to manoeuvre the Bionix upon the command of 2LT Ho. CPL Lim only had a frontal field of vision through three periscopes and the range was between 10 o’clock to 2 o’clock. He was unable to see what was behind the vehicle. Only 3SG Tay, the rear guide, was able to see what was behind. Accordingly, he was responsible for giving him directions when he was directed to reverse.

75     CPL Lim’s CVC helmet setting was set to intercom to communicate with his fellow crew members. He said the functioning of the CVC helmets was checked on the day of the incident prior to the start of the Exercise. In order to test the functioning, each crew member took turns to speak and every crew member was required to confirm if he was able to hear the other person speaking. He testified the only issue with the transmission was that the gunner (CPL Chan) and the rear guide’s (3SG Tay) voices were soft. CPL Lim asked them to repeat and he said the communication was then relatively clear.

76     He stated the safety speed limit in operating the Bionix is 30 kilometres per hour. He said it is the responsibility of the rear vehicle to maintain the 30 metre safety distance because only the rear vehicle can gauge and react in time.

77     Prior to the incident, he was travelling towards a junction when he saw through the periscope a Bionix which was quite far away. He informed 2LT Ho about it. However, he did not receive a response from 2LT Ho. CPL Lim slowed down as a result. Thereafter, he spotted three Bionix vehicles travelling in the same direction as the first Bionix. 2LT Ho then commanded him to stop. He also directed the gunner to fire. After the gunner had fired, he was directed to reverse by 2LT Ho. Under cross-examination, he said he is unable to recall if the command to fire and to reverse were given one after another or together.

78     CPL Lim testified that he was not expecting any instructions from the rear guide when he started to reverse. He said he would reverse straight unless he was instructed otherwise. Whilst reversing, he heard engine and ambient noise and one to two seconds later he heard ‘muffled radio disruption’ noise which he described to be like a static buzz through the CVC. He stated the static buzz had occurred intermittently when they were moving to delay points. In the process of reversing, he felt the left rear of the Bionix was lifted. He was surprised that the vehicle had hit something and instinctively thought he had hit the side kerb. He tried to counter-steer in order to get off the kerb. He was unable to remember in which direction he steered. However, after one to two seconds, the lift became higher. CPL Lim then felt that something was wrong. He stopped on his own accord. He then heard shouts of ‘stop’ from 2LT Ho and the rear guide through his CVC. He said he had stopped by then.

79     He said it is frequent for a Bionix to have a drift. He noticed BX13 had a slight drift when it was moving forward prior to the incident. He informed someone of the drift but was unable to remember who he informed. In cross-examination he said he would have probably informed 2LT Ho. According to him, he was nevertheless able to effectively control the Bionix. He made adjustments on his own by using the side of the road or the kerb as a reference to ensure the path of travel was straight. As for reversing prior to the incident, he said he had reversed over a short distance at delay points and he did not notice any drift.

80     As regards an extrication drill, he said that he could start reversing once the order ‘Driver reverse’ was given by 2LT Ho. He will reverse straight until the rear guide gave a command to change the reverse direction or to stop. In cross-examination, he said the sequence of commands for an extrication drill is driver stop, gunner fire, driver reverse. He stated the most effective method to alert a driver to stop is via a command through the CVC.

81     He was shown the animation produced by the Health Sciences Authority (‘HSA’), and he agreed that he initially steered intentionally to the left. He explained the Bionix was a bit slanted to the front left at the start. As such, when he was reversing, he was trying to stay in the middle of the axis and to reverse straight by being parallel to the right kerb. He felt a slight drift to the left thereafter. When it was pointed to him that the Inspection Report (P9) stated that BX13’s drift was to the right, CPL Lim said that he felt the vehicle’s slight drift was to the right when he was moving forward and to the left whilst reversing. He agreed that based on the footage in P2, the Bionix was quite a distance away from the left kerb which he thought he had hit. He said he was not sure if he was able to see the left kerb whilst reversing and he was also unable to recollect what exactly he saw whilst reversing.

82     He agreed the rear guide plays an important role during reversing as he is the ‘eyes’ for the rear. He agreed the rear guide has a duty to ensure that it is safe to reverse. He disagreed that he was not supposed to reverse without any guidance from the rear guide. He said that as a driver it was his responsibility to reverse straight by making adjustments. He was asked if it was safe to make adjustments without instructions from the rear guide, and he gave the following evidence[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7):

> 
| 

Q

 | 

Now, my question now is this, without hearing from the rear guide, do you think it was safe to do that?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Why?

 |
| 

A

 | 

So I can adjust myself to stay in the middle of the path because I know that if I were to continue reversing further it will hit---it---it will eventually hit the right side of the kerb.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

What if there are obstacles behind your vehicle

 |
| 

A

 | 

As in when---before the turn or after the turn?

 |
| 

Q

 | 

After the turn.

 |
| 

A

 | 

I mean, I wouldn’t expect there will be an obstacle there because before that I did travel that particular path or that road, so, I wouldn’t expect there will be anything or obstacle that will be obstructing there.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

You may not expect,---

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

but there is always a possibility, isn’t it?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I mean, I wouldn’t expect it because I eliminate the fact that there will be something there after I’ve just passed it.

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

So, perhaps, you can tell us, Mr. Lim, to your understanding, in what situations would the rear guide assist you?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

When---when I needed to adjust even more or to a certain direction.

### Evidence of PW9 – Third Sergeant Tay Cheng Jun (‘3SG Tay’)

83     3SG Tay was performing his national service when he took part in the Exercise. He was in the OPFOR team under the command of 2LT Ho. He was assigned to be the side machine gunner and rear guide for BX13. His role was to man the side machine gun and to give directions to the driver during a reverse manoeuvre.

84     He used the CVC helmet to communicate with the other crew members during the Exercise. He said they conducted a check to ensure they could hear each other by speaking into the CVC helmets before they moved off for the Exercise. The test was done first at the Vehicle Commander area and by speaking into the CVC to ascertain if CPL Lim (the driver) and CPL Chan (the gunner) were able to hear him. Thereafter, he went to the rear of the vehicle to test if they could still hear him. Asked if his CVC helmet was working during the Exercise prior to the incident, he said that he did not encounter any issue.

85     He stated there was a safety brief before the start of the Exercise. He said the safety distance of 30 metres was mentioned during the briefing, and it applied to all types of vehicles on the field. He said the onus is on the rear vehicle to maintain the safety distance as it is able to gauge the distance and its rationale is to prevent collisions as it gives allowances for mistakes so that drivers have enough time to react.

86     As regards overtaking in a combat situation like the Exercise, he said that if the vehicle in front is stationary and if it was safe to overtake, a two metre side distance must be maintained between the vehicles. In addition, communications will usually be established with the vehicle in front to inform that it was being overtaken to avoid any sudden manoeuvre on its part. In a situation where the vehicle might not remain stationary, he said he will not overtake unless the vehicle in front has been informed that it will be overtaken. He explained this was because he would not know what movement the vehicle would do. In cross-examination, he gave the following evidence on the need to establish communication[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8):

> Q    Would it be possible to overtake safely without establishing communications?

> A    If a vehicle is stationary and the engine is cut off.

> Q    Stationary vehicle, but no information as to whether engine is cut off or not. You’re approaching from behind and you want to overtake.

> A    You will never know whether the stationary vehicle will move or not.

87     During the Exercise, BX13 did not encounter any enemy forces until the junction where the accident happened. He stated that if they were to encounter Kaffir forces whilst on the move, the Bionix will stop and 2LT Ho will give a command to fire at the enemy, and upon firing, the order to reverse the vehicle will be given immediately thereafter. He said the driver can thereafter start to reverse without any further command.

88     As regards the incident, he said that as BX13 was approaching a junction, he heard through his CVC either the gunner or the driver reporting that a Bionix vehicle was seen passing through. He then peeked forward and saw more Bionix vehicles passing through. He said BX13 had stopped at that stage. He took a look to the rear and he saw the Land Rover approaching from a distance. Thereafter, 2LT Ho gave the command to fire and for the driver to reverse. 3SG Tay then looked to the back again and noticed the Land Rover’s stationary position was too close. He waived the Land Rover away. As it did not move, he asked the driver to stop through the CVC. He noticed the Bionix vehicle was not stopping. He then pushed the CVC set closer to his mouth and raised his voice to ask the driver to stop. However, the driver still did not stop and the Bionix collided into the Land Rover.

89     He said there were other instances when BX13 had reversed prior to the accident at delay points to get better cover. As regards his duty to guide the reversal, he gave the following evidence in response to the DPP’s questions[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9):

> Q    Can we just ask, you have said that you would guide the reverse, but during this reverse are you required to maintain constant communications with the driver?

> A    Uh, no.

> Q    And are you able to tell us why you do not need to maintain constant communications?

> A    Uh, it’s either when I’m giving directions is either left or right but if I’m not saying anything then my driver will usually reverse until he hear me say stop, then he will stop.

> Q    And maybe if you could just be a bit more specific, you said that directions, the directions you give are either left or right and if doesn’t hear anything from you, he will just reverse until he hears you say “Stop”. He will just reverse in what direction?

> A    In the gene---general direction that we are reversing in.

> Q    Are you able to tell us if it’s left, straight, right or any other direction that you are referring to without commands from you?

> A    Uh, straight.

90     In cross-examination, 3SG Tay said that he saw the accused’s Land Rover once prior to the incident at a delay point. He said the accused’s vehicle was parked opposite and he gave his opinion on how BX13 should be positioned.

91     With respect to the events prior to the accident, 3SG Tay said that he did not know that the driver had steered to the left whilst reversing. On what a driver can do whilst reversing without any instructions from the rear guide, he gave the following evidence[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10):

> 
| 

Q

 | 

Can the driver turn without any instructions from you whilst reversing?

 |
| 

A

 | 

No.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

He can only reverse straight, correct?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And the reason is because the driver cannot see where he is going and he needs you to guide him, correct?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yah, correct.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

So, what’s your understanding of---when asked, can driver turn, what’s your understanding?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Driver turn, if it’s left or right, it’s almost at least turn 45 degree or more in my understanding if I ask him to turn.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Sorry, can ---can you repeat that, please?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

So, if I ask him to turn left or right, I will expect like a mi---major turn of at least more than, like, 45 degree or something.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, if he were to make a turn of less than 45 degrees, he may do so without your command?

 |
| 

A

 | 

To me, that is, uh, a minor change because in our BX, we know that there is always a bit of s---uh, drifting going on. And then when there’s this type of minor change, I won’t go and micro-manage and tell him to turn how many degrees or what. So, he will just do it on his own.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Okay. Let’s leave aside drifting for the time being.

 |
| 

A

 | 

Okay.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Am I right to say that a driver may turn less than 45 degrees without any instruction from you?

 |
| 

A

 | 

It depends on the context. If he’s just doing minor changes which I cannot even notice on the vehicle, I will not say anything.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And what will be minor changes, can you elaborate on this?

 |
| 

A

 | 

If I’m on the vehicle and I can’t sense that the vehicle is turning a lot, then, to me, that’s minor changes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, if just minor deviation from a straight line, it will not be considered---it’ll be considered minor changes?

 |
| 

A

 | 

If I can’t sense it when I’m on the BX, to me, it’s considered minor changes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, it depends on whether you can sense it?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Is it able---are you able to quantify this?

 |
| 

A

 | 

No.

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

Q

 | 

In terms of positioning the vehicle to be straight, whose concern would that be, would it be your concern or his concern?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Your Honour, I’m not sure we have a fixed res---responsibility for that. Whoever feel that it is not straight, we will just voice it---voice---voice it out.

92     He was shown Appendix 2 of the technical report by ST Engineering (Electronics) (exh P15), photo exhibit number 4, of his CVC helmet. The report states that the bailout cable attached to the CVC helmet was defective in that it will not be able to function or communicate with other users within the intercom system. 3SG Tay maintained that his CVC helmet was working at all times.

### Evidence of PW10 – Lieutenant-Colonel Mike Ng Zhichao (‘LTC Mike Ng’)

93     LTC Mike is the Head of Doctrine and Training Development Branch in the Armoured Headquarters. He was referred to Chapter 11 of the Army Training Safety Regulation (‘TSR’) on Armour Operations by HQ Armour which was last reviewed on 1 June 2018 (P4). He said the TSR contains prescriptive rules to conduct training in a safe and effective manner.

94     He was referred to para 38 which states, “_During movement, the AFV \[Armoured Fighting Vehicle\] Commander must: c. Maintain safety distance of at least 30 meters between vehicles.”_ The rule is taught to all armoured vocationalists. He said the 30 metres refers to the radius and it includes the front, back and sides of the armoured vehicle. He stated the responsibility lies with the rear vehicle as it is in a better position to assess the safety distance. Its purpose is to ensure that there is space to perform whatever action that is required safely and effectively during armoured operations. Asked if the accused who was an armoured vocationalist in the Land Rover was required to observe the 30-metre rule vis-à-vis an armoured vehicle, he said the rule also applied to him.

95     He was next referred to para 29 of the TSR which relates to overtaking. It states: “_AFV commanders are to maintain safety distance of at least 2 metres between other vehicles when overtaking/ bypassing them. In the event where the minimum safety distance could not be maintained, a ground guide must be deployed to guide the vehicle across safely.”_ He stated the pre-condition for overtaking is that it must be performed in a safe manner. Only if the overtaking can be done safely, it must be ensured that there is a two-metre distance. He stated to be safe, it is ‘cardinal’ that the vehicle which intends to overtake must communicate with the front vehicle to inform the front vehicle of the intention to overtake. He said communication can be done via radio or physically by sounding the horn, waiving the hand or a flag. He stated the need to communicate intention is not explicitly stated in the TSR. Asked if he had come across the teaching of the need to communicate before overtaking, he said that it would have been taught through the training system.

96     In cross-examination, when asked if he could not be sure that the need to establish communication with the front vehicle when overtaking was taught to all armoured personnel, he gave the following evidence[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11):

> Q    But you cannot be sure whether it has been taught?

> A    From my personal experience, when I went through the training, um, they are---I have learned that these are some of the ways to communicate. Yah.

> Q    But it is something that you cannot be certain, correct, that all other armoured personnel would have learned of this requirement?

> A    I say this because just now the Prosecution asked me to clarify. It is not explicitly stated. Therefore, from the governance point of view, I cannot s---attest that this have been taught because these are not explicitly stated. But I will say from my own personal experience as I go through the training, they would have covered at some point, yah. Because if it’s natural---it is natural for you to establish the intention to communicate because we all want to do it safely.

97     As regards whether it can be safe to overtake if there is a distance of two meters without establishing communication, his evidence was as follows[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12):

> Q    Can you imagine a scenario where it is also safe to overtake if you can overtake by more than 2 metres from the front vehicle but without first having to communicate with the front vehicle?

> A    I agree but not in the---in the situation where it is mission-based exercise or---yah.

> …

> A    Yes. I---what I mean---what I’m trying to say is in combat situations, everybody know that the area is expected to have combat fight. And then therefore, a person that is commanding or in a vehicle will not---cannot haphazardly make that decision to overtake without understanding the---the situation that is---that---that is evolving, lah. Yah.

> …

> Q    So, would you agree, you’re saying that the only way to overtake safely would then be to establish communications with the front vehicle?

> A    Yes.

> Q    And even if the rear vehicle do not expect any fire fight ahead of him, he should still establish communications with the front vehicle.

> A    Yes.

> Q    And the difference between in a combat situation and non-combat situation is that in a combat situation, the front vehicle may do what that may compromise safety for the vehicle that is going to overtake it?

> A    I would say that in the combat situations, things are very fluid, you don’t know when you will be spotted by the opposition force or when the opposition force will spot you. And in these dynamic situations, it’s important without certainty, doing any actions, I think will any---will not be safe to do so.

98     As regards an extrication drill, he said the correct sequence is stop, reverse and fire. However, on the ground the reverse and fire actions are carried out by two different individuals. He agreed that a new extrication drill was introduced after November 2018. He said the key difference is that in the old drill, the Commander will give the command “Driver, stop”, “Driver, reverse” and “SC guide”. The revised command is “Driver, stop. SC guide reverse”. He said an emergency horn was also installed at the trunk compartment which the rear guide can access to sound in order to bring the vehicle to a stop in an emergency.

99     He said the purpose of the extrication drill is to enhance the survivability of the crew. He said the driver has the authority to reverse once the order to reverse is given in an extrication drill and he does not have to wait for the rear guide to guide him. He stated the driver is expected to reverse straight. He was asked in cross-examination[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13):

> 
| 

Q

 | 

And if he feels that he’s not moving in a straight manner, can he make adjustments by steering perhaps a bit to the left or to the right without consulting the rear guide?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Okay. The overarching intention is for the driver to drive independently especially in the combat situations where the commanders would be pre-occupied with engaging the enemy.

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

A

 | 

If there is no orders from the rear guide, this driver can do fine tune---fine adjustment. Because the principle behind the drill was for the driver to try to drive independently. Yah. Until specific orders given, then he will---then he will have to listen to the orders. And not demand that he can still continue to drive independently. So, yap.

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Yes. And to what extent can he steer the vehicle? Because you said fine tune, but it’s really a question of extent.

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Yah. Yah, I think he---he does have---as long as he can---he---uh, he’s---okay. I don’t want---I would say that in the extreme case, where you expect the driver to suddenly do a hard turn is very impossible. But when you say that he’s trying to because he has travelled that path along, he trying to align a vehicle to the track, so that it doesn’t reverse into the vegetation, there is this possibility that the driver can---can adjust the steering in order to get back on the track. Yap.

100    He was referred to para 5 of the TSR issued by HQ Transport (P13) which lists the various roles and responsibilities of Vehicle Commanders. Para 5a states that the Vehicle Commanders are “_To be responsible for the discipline and safety of all passengers/ crew in the assigned transport detail_.” He confirmed that the accused was responsible for the safety of the crew of the Land Rover as its Vehicle Commander. He also confirmed that the accused was responsible “to assist to look out for obstruction, hazard or danger.” (para 5b).

### Evidence of PW11 – Tan Chin Kiong (‘Tan CK’)

101    Tan CK is the Deputy Department Manager in ST Engineering (Electronics). He testified that on 12 November 2018, ST Engineering was requested by the Criminal Investigation Department (‘CID’) and the Special Investigation Branch (‘SIB’) of the SAF to provide an assessment report on _inter alia_ the functionality of the communication system used in Bionix vehicle MID 63618 (‘BX13’) and the rear guide’s helmet. He prepared a report (exh P15) that details his assessment.

102    He received the rear guide’s helmet with bailout cable in a sealed bag from SIB. He did a visual examination upon receipt and noticed two defects in the bailout cable. He placed musking tape on the cable and drew two arrows to indicate the two locations with defects. Six photographs were taken.

103    He found the Intercom system of BX13 (the Master Control Station and Full Function Crew Stations) to be in working condition. The rear guide’s helmet when attached with the faulty bailout cable was not able to communicate with other users within the intercom system. He said it was not able to transmit or receive messages.

104    He explained there are seven Pins in the bailout cable and they each have a specific function for the CVC helmet. Four Pins were found to be working. Two Pins were ‘Intermittent short to ground’ which meant that they sometimes functioned and one Pin was ‘Open’ which meant that it did not work. He found the ‘Mic Signal’ pin was open which meant that it was not able to transmit messages. He found the ‘Audio signal’ to be ‘OK’, which meant the CVC helmet was able to hear messages. However, on the day of the test, he found that no messages could be received or transmitted.

105    He said the defects in the bailout cable were not as a result of normal wear and tear but were due to the force of a very heavy weight object or it was wedged between something. He was unable to comment on how recent the defects were.

### Evidence of PW11 – Colonel Tang Chong Kiat (‘COL Tang’)

106    COL Tang is the commanding officer of the 42nd Battalion Singapore Armoured Regiment. He was the Exercise supervising officer.

107    He said the accused had completed the appointment of platoon commander prior to assuming the role of trainer. He said the accused was expected to guide 2LT Ho in his decision making. He was required to have situational awareness of the developments in the Exercise by listening to the communication of 2LT Ho with his crew and other platoon mates and to the updates which trainers were given on the developments and the tempo of the Exercise. In addition, the accused as the Vehicle Commander of the Land Rover had the responsibility to place the overall safety of himself, his crew and others around him at utmost priority.

108    As regards the 30 metre safety distance to be kept between vehicles, he said it also applied to the accused’s Land Rover. He said it applied even if the rear vehicle was not directly behind but was in a staggered position. He said the responsibility to keep the safety distance lay with the rear vehicle as it had a natural emphasis on what was in front.

109    As regards overtaking another vehicle, he said that in order to do so safely, the vehicle at the rear should communicate its intent before undertaking the action to overtake in order that the vehicle that will be bypassed knows of it. He said this to ensure that there would be no action from the vehicle that will be overtaken. As regards how the communication is to be established with the Vehicle Commander of the vehicle in front, he said there are generally two methods. One is through visual means by a flag signal. The other way is through radio communication. As the requirement of establishing communication is not stated in the TSR, he was asked by the learned DPP:[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14)

> Yes. Colonel Tang, this need to make your intent known before you overtake a vehicle, and the need to establish communications is not explicitly stated in the Training Safety Regulations, okay. So, why do you nevertheless say that it---it---it’s a requirement, it should be done?

He answered:

> Um, I would say it is important to do so, um, and, Your Honour, there are many important things, uh, some things are written in the Training Safety Regulation, some are written in our doctrine and operating manuals. In this case, uh, when we are taught, this was taught during the---the movement techniques in a tactical environment where we expect overtaking and bypassing of vehicles to be very likely. And one of the key principles of these movement techniques is good command and control, and communications. And here, communications, is really about ensuring that we know of each other’s intent or intended actions, and we are aware when one executes it, uh, so that the techniques are properly executed between vehicles. And in---in a tactical scenario we expect vehicles to move and bypass one another in tandem with the idea of the operational plan.

110    He said the importance of communication is found in the teachings and doctrine of movement techniques and battle formations. He stated the principles of good command and control, of which communications is a part, is taught to commanders who go through leadership and tactical training (battle formations and movement techniques). He said that communications is a broad principle that applies not only to overtaking but it involves creating a collective sense of situational awareness between vehicles. In cross-examination, asked if overtaking can be done safely without communication, he gave the following answer[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15):

> Q    My question wasn’t about correctness, it was about whether was this---can it be done safely which appears to be the foremost consideration, can an overtaking exercise be performed safely without having to establish communication with the front vehicle?

> A    Your Honour, in my opinion, it will be unsafe to do so, even if the space constraint and the terrain capacity allows, um, and this is because of the important perspective where if the vehicle that you wish to overtake is unaware of your intended action, the vehicle might move and that might cause even greater, uh, safety issues to the vehicle that is attempting to overtake it.

111    With respect to the extrication drill, he said the idea behind the drill is to bring the vehicle from a potentially dangerous position where it could be under enemy fire to one that is safe to ensure survivability. He stated that the driver is supposed to reverse after the command to reverse is given.

112    He was shown the footage P6 at time stamp 9.42.17 which shows junction F40 and was asked to look at the junction ahead (Nissan-Ferrari axis). COL Tang estimated the distance of the junction to be about 200 to 300 meters from the accused’s Land Rover. COL Tang observed a vehicle which looked like a Bionix vehicle at the junction. He was next asked to focus on timestamp 09:49:45 of the radio communication between BX13 informing BX13B of the likelihood of a vehicle coming towards it and later asking it to pull back to line Odysseus. COL Tang said that he saw two Bionix vehicles that passed across the same junction and another Kaffir Company Bionix vehicle BX23A at 9.50.10 in the course of the travel of the Land Rover. In cross-examination, he was asked if he agreed that BX13B did not did state where its exact location was. COL Tang replied that his understanding from what BX13B had said was that it was at or very near to line Odysseus.

113    Next, he was referred to the footage which shows BX13 stopping before junction F54 at 09:51:42. He was asked what the accused’s assessment of the situation ought to have been at that point. He said that taking into account the exchanges between BX13 and BX13B where BX13B stated it was already at the terminal point of line Odysseus, there were two possibilities: 1) that having seen three Kaffir vehicles, there was a high likelihood that they have reached line Odysseus first and cut-off BX13, or 2) that 2LT Ho was uncertain of his situation in relation to where BX13B could be and where the Kaffir forces could be and was making sense of the situation to make a decision. He said that as the trainer, the accused could have taken a passive approach and allowed the situation to develop, or he could have communicated with 2LT Ho and asked him if he knew what the situation is and his intended course of action.

114    He stated that if 2LT Ho spotted Kaffir Bionix vehicles in front, then it was very likely he would have had to fire at them and thereafter immediately move towards a safe location by doing an extrication drill.

115    In cross-examination, he said the accused will not know the details of Kaffir’s plan for the Exercise. Asked if it was fair for the accused to assume that 2LT Ho had seen BX13B when he messaged at 09:51:48. “_I see your vehicle, your vehicle is in front of me correct_?”, he replied[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16):

> Um, well, these exchanges suggested that Nathaniel sees a vehicle and he’s trying to clarify with Chong Min whether that vehicle is his and that Chong Min when he looks around based on his reply, he did not see Nathaniel in kind or in response and therefore, Your Honour, to the question of whether it’s fair to say that, uh, Nathaniel had seen Chong Min, I thought on the contrary, uh, one would get a sense that Nathaniel would have thought that he---he---he got the wrong vehicle and that vehicle is not Chong Min.

116    In response to the question if it was objectionable to overtake if the accused believed there were no Kafir forces in front of BX13, COL Tan gave the following evidence[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17):

> Q    No, ambiguity suggest uncertainty. Can I pose this to you, if Captain Ong was under the or---or rather that Captain Ong believed that the blue forces were coming from the northerly direction from the north which means behind---coming from behind him and he had no reason to believe there were any enemy forces in front of Nathaniel, is there anything objectionable in Captain Ong trying to overtake Nathaniel?

> A    Your Honour, this is an important question. I---I think, um, whether the vehicle commander had assessed if there were enemies in front or there were no enemies in front, it remains an area of ambiguity and uncertainty and one cannot be sure of either and I---Your Honour, my perspective is one where we ask ourselves whether we would do anything to a certain ambiguity and whether we would have ensured that it was safe to do so before doing anything, uh, I---I---I thought to me, if you ask me from a mili---military commander perspective, uh, that comes out more strongly I supposed to taking a perspective on whether there’s enemy there or not, uh, it is more about given the current situation of ambiguity whether one would actually bring itself into an area of greater ambiguity.

117    He was shown the composite video P6 of BX13 reversing. He was asked if the vehicle shifted to the left about two to three seconds after it started to reverse. COL Tang said that the steering was not significantly altered, and it was a slight shift in its rearward direction. He added that there was nothing wrong in the shift in direction given the width of the axis. He said it was a permissible adjustment for the driver to make.

118    He agreed the Bionix should not be in motion if there is any malfunction of its communication equipment.

### Evidence of PW13 – Ahmad Bin Abul Hassan (‘DSP Ahmad’)

119    Deputy Superintendent of Police (‘DSP’) Ahmad is the investigation officer of the case.

120    He stated that the timestamp of the in-vehicle footage of the Land Rover is six minutes slower than Singapore standard time.

121    He confirmed that he seized the CVC helmets of the crew of BX13 on 3 November 2018. He said the helmets were in BX13 and a SAF personnel assisted to retrieve them individually from the hatches and informed him to whom they belonged. The helmets were marked and sealed in a polymer bag. DSP Ahmad did not examine the helmets. The helmets were brought to Sungei Gedong camp on the same day and handed to SAF, SIB to submit to ST Engineering for testing.

122    On 9 November 2018, DSP Ahmad with a party of police officers from Special Investigation Section, CID went to inspect BX13. They put on the CVC helmets and discovered that the rear guide’s helmet was not working.

## Prima facie case

123    There was no submission of no case made at the close of the prosecution’s case. I was of the view that there is some evidence which is not inherently incredible and which satisfied each and every element of the charge as framed, and the accused was called upon to give his defence. The standard allocution was administered and he elected to give evidence. He called four witnesses in his defence.

## Defence case

### Evidence of DW1 – Accused

124    The accused’s military career begun in 2011 when he was enlisted and signed on as a SAF regular. He has been holding the rank of Captain since June 2017. In December 2017, he was posted to Armour Unit Training Centre as a trainer.

125    As regards the Exercise, he said his role as platoon trainer was to follow 2LT Ho. He said he had to maintain a safety distance of 30 meters unless he was overtaking. He said the TSR only mandates that he keep a two meter side distance when overtaking. However, he had to assess if the situation was safe in order to overtake. If it was safe, he was not required to communicate his intention to overtake to the front vehicle. He claimed he was not taught that he must communicate the intention to overtake and he had also not witnessed it being done. He said there are safety practices like the vehicle in front must be stationary and staggering of the vehicle to have a direct view of what is in front before overtaking.

126    On 3 November 2018 at about 8am, the accused started near F19 where BX13A was positioned. He said that after BX13A was ‘exercise killed’, he moved to the area near junctions E24 and E25 but he did not see any of the OPFOR Bionix vehicles. He then moved to F28. He claimed that he saw BX13B and BX13 in close proximity with their turrets pointed to the North-West. He dismounted and approached 2LT Ho. He advised him on how to position his vehicle and told him that he would have to alter his plan to accommodate the gap in the Eastern sector caused by the destruction of BX13A. 2LT Ho then shifted the Bionix to face towards the East but BX13B was still in the vicinity of F28.

127    After about 10 minutes, 2LT Ho moved to the third delay point at F40 and stopped along the Wira axis. The Bionix was positioned to face North. The accused instructed the deceased to position the Land Rover along the Toyota axis between junctions F41 and F40 and facing East.

128    He waited along the Toyota axis for about 10 to 15 minutes until 2LT Ho gave the command to proceed to the final delay line. Asked if he knew where the position of BX13B was during the 10 to 15 minutes, he said its rough location should be somewhere to the West of F43 along the Jaguar axis. As for the Kaffir forces, he believed they were nearby but still in the North. He said he recalled that 2LT Ho had said over the radio that he heard a vehicle and was preparing to contact it, which gave him the impression that a fight was imminent. However, within less than five minutes, 2LT Ho ordered to move to the last delay point and he noticed BX13 had shifted to travel to the South.

129    The accused then decided to follow BX13 towards its final delay point. He knew the route that BX13 would take as 2LT Ho had shared the exercise plan with him on the day before. Asked if he saw any other Kaffir Bionix before the Land Rover moved off, he answered that he did not. He said that when the Land Rover made a U-turn to travel West towards F42, he saw a Kaffir Bionix to the North of F40. From F42, the Land Rover travelled down to F44, to F53 and finally to F54 where the accident happened.

130    Asked if he knew why BX13 came to a stop before F54, he said that he believed 2LT Ho was trying to link-up with the vehicle in front of him which he had identified to be BX13B in order to go to the final delay point. He made that assessment because 2LT Ho had said ‘I see your vehicle, your vehicle is in front of me correct?’ as stated in the transcript P4. However, he was unable to see what 2LT Ho had seen due to the vegetation which blocked his view. He also assessed the Kaffir forces were still in the North and may come from the rear via the same axis F54. As he had assessed the risk of the enemy forces coming from the North via the axis was higher, and as BX13 was stationary and there was a two-metre wide gap at the side, he was of the view that it was safe to overtake and instructed the deceased to overtake BX13.

131    Shortly after he had given the command to overtake and the Land Rover moved forward, he heard three shots were fired by BX13 towards the South. The accused said he was surprised that BX13 fired as he thought it was BX13B that was in front. He then saw two helmets bobbing and passing from left to right at the junction ahead. He assessed BX13 had been cut-off and ‘exercise killed’.

132    He said he did not expect BX13 to come towards the direction of the Land Rover as it was in a staggered position in relation to BX13. He said BX13 should have reversed straight and it would not then have collided into the Land Rover. He heard the rear guide shouting ‘stop’ into his CVC helmet and he had also shouted ‘stop’ several times but the driver failed to stop.

133    The section 22 CPC statement which he made on 8 February 2019 (D1) and 11 April 2019 (D2) and his s 23 CPC statement (D3) which he handwrote were admitted by the defence. On 8 February 2019, the accused was shown a snippet of the video before he gave his statement. He said he was surprised he gave the command to overtake. He claimed there was a gap in his memory and was accordingly unable to recall why he gave the command. Subsequently, he contacted the investigating officer to allow him to view the complete video footage to jog his memory on why he directed the overtaking manoeuvre. On 11 April 2019, he was allowed to view the video for quite some time but he was still unable to recollect when statement D2 was recorded. On the same day, in the late afternoon or evening, he asked a colleague for the training area map and spoke to colleagues who were present at the scene with regard to the incident. He said that one of them said something ‘along the line of north or coming from the north’ and it suddenly jogged his memory and he was then able to remember clearly the considerations which operated on his mind when he directed the overtaking manoeuvre.

### Evidence of DW2 – Lim Wei Xian, Joel (‘CPT Joel’)

134    CPT Joel is an Armour Officer with the SAF and holds the rank of Captain. He was commissioned as an infantry officer in 2011. He was involved in the Exercise as a trainer for one of the platoons of Kaffir Company.

135    He agreed the purpose of an extrication drill is to reverse to safety to avoid counter fire from the enemy that has been fired at. He stated the driver would reverse on command of the Vehicle Commander and must reverse straight. The driver must rely on the command of the rear guide to make any adjustment to the direction when reversing as the driver is unable to see behind. In cross-examination, he said when driving in a forward movement, the driver can make adjustments based on his judgment. Asked if when reversing, the driver can roughly determine whether he is reversing in alignment by looking at the sides of the path or axis, he answered, “In a reversing manoeuvre, generally, yes.” Asked if it would be safer to reverse to be parallel to the path or axis compared to reversing off the path or axis without any direction from the rear guide, he answered that it would be safer to stop. He said the driver can communicate with the rear guide and/or the Vehicle Commander to seek guidance.

136    With respect to overtaking, he said the vehicle must be stationary and there must be a two metre side clearance with the stationary vehicle. He said there is no requirement to establish any communication with the vehicle that is being overtaken and neither has it been taught during training that communication must be established.

137    In cross-examination, asked if he would agree that there should be no overtaking if there is a risk that the Bionix may move, he replied, “_You will have to assess the risk but I agree with that, yah._” He agreed that if a Bionix has made an unscheduled stop, there would be a risk as to whether it will remain stationary or move off. He was then cross-examined as follows on the issue of establishing communications when overtaking such a Bionix[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18):

> Q    There is a risk---

> A    Yah.

> Q    correct? Because that Bionix might move, correct?

> A    Yes.

> Q    And if you don’t establish communications with it, you cannot be sure whether it will move or whether it will stay there, correct?

> A    (pause – 00:00:07) If I don’t establish communications with it, I cannot be sure whether it will move or i---

> Q    Or whether it will stay there.

> A    Yes.

> Q    So, wouldn’t you agree with me that if you have a ready mode of communication with that Bionix, to err on the side of caution, to be safe, you should establish communications with that Bionix you want to overtake.

> A    For communications, uh, like I mentioned, because it’s---it’s not a teaching but there are some form of practices, uh, there are various ways to communicate. Some trainers in tight terrain, if they assess, yes, it’s safe to go, maybe a bit tight, they will---they will use the horn of the Bionix---uh, of the---of the Land Rover or the OUV. Others, like I mentioned earlier, they might dismount, catch the attention, mount back, then they will go. Some, they might catch the attention of the vehicle commander or the rear guide through line of sight. Uh, there’s---there’s---these are the various forms of communications, uh, could possibly do. Um, your question on whether it will move while---while the overtaking manoeuvre is taking place, it’s---it is a risk, yes, I agree, but any movement should have been a forward movement. Uh, and if the Land Rover is overtaking a BX in a---and the BX moves forward, the Land Rover is controlled to come to a stop.

> …

> Q    Even if that Bionix is going to move ahead, it’s still a moving Bionix, you are not supposed to overtake it. Yes or no?

> A    Yes.

> Q    So, the point remains it is still unsafe, if that Bionix is going to move, to overtake it. Correct or no?

> A    Yes.

> Q    I’m just going to suggest to you---as you have mentioned, there are modes of communication---

> A    Mmm hmm.

> Q    I’m going to suggest to you, in a situation where you are unsure whether the Bionix is going to move or whether it’s going to stay safe, you should establish communications with that Bionix to ensure that it knows you are going to overtake before you overtake it.

> A    In good practice, yes.

> Q    So, you agree with me that it’s good practice to do so?

> A    Yah.

> Q    And it’s good practice because it’s safe to do so, correct?

> A    Yes.

> Q    And as you said earlier, it’s unsafe to overtake a moving Bionix, correct?

> A    Yes.

> Q    I’m just going to put it to you that in a situation where a Bionix not re---might not remain stationary, it is unsafe to order an overtake if you do not first establish communications with that Bionix. Agree or disagree?

> A    (pause – 00:00:06) If you have assessed that it will move, it will be unsafe.

> Q    Without establishing communications?

> A    Yes.

> Q    And I’m just going to put it to you to be clear, if there is even a risk---

> A    Mmm hmm.

> Q    that that Bionix that you want to overtake will move, then you must establish communications first, so that it is safe for you to overtake. Agree or disagree?

> A    If you have assessed that it will definitely move---

> Q    I said “risk”. My question is clear and simple.

> A    Okay.

> Q    If there is a risk that that Bionix will overtake \[sic\], you must establish communications with it if you want to overtake safely. Agree or disagree?

> A    Agree.

### Evidence of DW3 – Sylvester Wong Wei Liang (‘CPT Wong’)

138    CPT Wong is the officer commanding in Braves Company, 40 SAR. He was enlisted into the Army in 2014. He was a platoon trainer in 2018.

139    He stated that after the command to reverse is given by the Vehicle Commander in an extrication drill, the driver can reverse immediately. He said the driver will reverse straight and the rear guide would guide the reversing. The driver would then follow the commands given by the rear guide. He said the driver cannot make any adjustment to the path of travel on his own as he is unable to see the rear. He said if the driver is in doubt, he should stop and ask. In cross-examination, he said that if the Bionix has a drift, the driver can then counter steer to correct the drift.

140    With respect to overtaking a stationary Bionix, he said it will only be done if the assessment is that it is safe to do so. He said the factors to be taken into account include the gap between the vehicles, visibility of the frontage, and consideration of the front vehicle’s intent. He said he would not establish communication if he had deemed it safe to overtake. He said if there is a bend in front, or if the space is tight even though there is a two metre gap, he had seen others sounding the horn, or getting the attention of the rear guide, or using radio communication.

### Evidence of DW4 – Yeo Jin Xu (‘Yeo’)

141    Yeo was a fulltime national serviceman between 2014 to 2016 with the rank of third sergeant. He served as a qualified vehicle commander for six months. Thereafter, he was appointed as a section commander and performed the duties of a vehicle commander when needed.

142    Yeo has driven a Bionix. He agreed the 30 meters safety distance between vehicles applies if the rear vehicle is in a staggered position and not directly behind the front vehicle. He confirmed a Bionix driver can reverse immediately upon receiving the command to reverse. He said the driver must reverse straight and cannot make adjustments to the path of travel without a command. He said the driver also cannot adjust the reversal direction to be parallel with the axis without any command because he is unable to see the rear. In cross-examination, he agreed that a driver would be able to see if his vehicle is reversing straight in relation to the axis as he is able to see the sides of the axis. He disagreed the driver can make slight adjustments to ensure the vehicle is parallel to the axis. He said this is because the driver has no visibility behind the vehicle.

143    With respect to the overtaking of a stationary Bionix, he said it is allowed if the vision forward is clear and there is a two-meter side clearance distance. He said he was not taught that communications must be established prior to overtaking. He also had not observed any of his colleagues doing that. In cross-examination, he gave the following evidence on when it is safe to overtake[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19):

> Q    So, you must be able to have a clear view of what is ahead of the vehicle you intend to overtake?

> A    Yes.

> Q    Am I right to say you also must have a understanding of what is in front of that Bionix that you want to overtake? So, if it’s a unknown situation in front, you don’t know what’s going to happen, it’s not safe to overtake that Bionix, right?

> A    Yes.

> …

> Q    So, am I right to say that it’s only safe to move and overtake a Bionix if you are certain that the Bionix in front is not going to move when you do the overtake?

> A    Yes.

> Q    And if there is a chance that the Bionix in front, the---the one you intend to overtake, is going to move in any direction, it is not safe to overtake?

> A    Yes.

> …

> Q    Okay. Would you then dismount from your vehicle to walk forward and check whether the frontage is clear before you overtake?

> A    Yes, I will do that.

### Evidence of DW5 – Lai Wen Pang (‘Lai’)

144    Lai served his fulltime national service between 2015 and 2017 as an armoured infantry platoon commander combatant. He holds the rank of Lieutenant.

145    He stated the driver is required to reverse immediately when he is instructed to do so in an extrication drill by the Vehicle Commander. The driver must reverse straight and listen for further commands. The driver cannot make adjustments if he feels that the vehicle is not parallel to the axis because the driver is unable to see what is at the rear of the vehicle. The side vision of the driver is also limited. He said the driver should stop the Bionix and wait for instructions if he thinks it will reverse into the side kerb by going straight. However, when moving forward the driver can make minor adjustments to ensure he is travelling straight.

146    As regards overtaking, he said the vision in front must be clear to assess the situation, there must be sufficient side clearance, and the front vehicle must be stationary. He agreed that if there is a chance the vehicle may move, there should be no overtaking.

147    He said it is not necessary to establish communication with the front vehicle before overtaking. He said he was not taught that there must be communication and he had not seen others doing so. However, he said that he would communicate with the vehicle if he did not have a frontal view and if he did not know what the vehicle will do next as he will not be able to assess if it was safe to overtake. His evidence is set out below[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20):

Court:

 | 

Okay, Mr. Lai, let me ask you this. Say, you know, you do want to overtake, okay, your intention is to overtake but you can’t see in front, okay, and you do not know what the next move of the BX is. Okay, can’t see in front, you do not know why the BX is there waiting, do not know what it is going to do. In that sort of scenario, would you just stay put, don’t overtake, or because you want to overtake, you would ask the BX, you know, “Are you---why are you there?” So, what is the action that you would take?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I will ask the BX.

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Mr. Lai, my question is a follow-up to what Her Honour has asked you, alright? You cannot see what’s ahead of the Bionix.

 |
| 

A

 | 

Mmm.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So given that condition, you do not know what the Bionix is going to do, and you agree that you will ask the Bionix.

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

If you can see what’s ahead of Bionix, would that change your answer?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes, I would change my answer.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

How would you answer---how would you---what would you do then?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Because if I can see what’s ahead of the Bionix, I can assess the situation myself already.

## Findings

148    Three observations are apposite at the outset. First, whilst the untimely death of the deceased during the military training exercise was tragic, I bore in mind that his death per se must not influence my decision. Second, I had endeavoured to bear in mind that I must avoid too critical an armchair analysis of the events. Third, I have referred only to the timings in the video-footage, which is six minutes behind the actual time, and have not made reference to the actual timings reflected in the Agreed Statement of Facts and the charge.

### Elements of the charge

##### (i) _Actus reus_

149    The _actus reus_ that must be proven is that it was unsafe to order the overtaking without first have established communications with BX13 which resulted in the failure to keep a safety distance of 30 meters between the vehicles.

150    The requirement to maintain a 30 meter safety distance between vehicles is uncontroversial. It is stipulated in regulation 38c of Chapter 11 of the TSR (see P14). It is not in dispute that the onus is on the vehicle which is behind to adhere to this distance. The rationale for the safety distance is obviously to avoid collisions. There is also a requirement to maintain a separation safety distance of at least two meters at the side between other vehicles when overtaking/bypassing (Regulation 29).

151    COL Tang, the Commanding Officer of the 42nd Battalion, Singapore Armoured Regiment, who was the Exercise supervising officer, and LTC Mike Ng, who is the Head of Doctrine and Training Development Branch, Armoured Headquarters testified that the 30 meter safety distance must be abided by even if the vehicle behind is in a staggered formation. It is not in dispute that the Land Rover had initially stopped 30 to 31 meters behind BX13 in compliance with the safety distance requirement. After the Land Rover moved forward, upon the accused’s instructions to overtake, it stopped upon hearing the three rounds fired by BX13. This resulted in a distance of between 16 to 18 meters behind BX13.

152    It is undisputed that the accused did not communicate his intent to overtake to 2LT Ho. His explanation for not having established communications with BX13 before instructing the deceased to overtake was that he “_he had already spent some time to assess the situation to determine if it was safe enough to perform \[the\] overtaking manoeuvre._”

153    The accused’s evidence was that it is “_not a hard requirement that I have to establish communications in order to overtake safely. I can overtake safely if I had assessed the situation and judged it to be safe without the need to establish communication as well_”. This position was not supported by COL Tang. He said that even if the space and terrain allows for overtaking, it is unsafe to do so without letting the vehicle know it would be overtaken as the vehicle might move.

154    As the _actus reus_ is one of rashness, the prosecution in its submissions stated “that its case is that the accused’s rashness did not lie in his failure to establish communications _per se_; rather, it lay in his failure to do so despite the obviously dangerous circumstances.”

#### (ii)   Mens rea

155    The _mens rea_ is that the accused had rashly ordered the overtake. As to what constitutes rashness, I shall refer to the recent case of _PP v Chong Chee Boon Kenneth and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 182</span> (‘_Chong Chee Boon Kenneth’)_, where the offenders were Singapore Civil Defence Force (‘SCDF’) officers, and the Commander and Deputy Commander respectively at a fire station. On appeal by the Public Prosecutor, they were both convicted by the High Court on charges of abetment by intentionally aiding the servicemen from the Fire Station to commit an offence of causing grievous hurt to a full-time national serviceman by doing a rash act which endangered human life. In essence, the offenders had illegally omitted to prevent the servicemen from making the deceased, a full-time national serviceman, to enter a 12-metre deep pump well at the fire station. It was held at \[87\]:

> “Rashness connotes heedlessness or indifference towards risk, … (see Jali at \[21\]). The test for culpable rashness encompasses situations where there is in fact subjective appreciation of risk by the accused and situations of obvious risk where the accused _ought as a reasonable person_ to have been conscious of the risk (see Jali at \[32\]).” (emphasis added)

##### (iii)    _Causation_

156    The test is that it must be established that the accused’s rash act was the substantial cause of the death even if there are other contributing causes.

## Was it rash to order the overtaking?

157    There were two planks to the accused’s defence as to why he ordered the overtaking. First, he did not want to be in the way of a ‘fire fight’ as his assessment was that the Kaffir Company forces were still in the North and there was a ‘high possibility’ that they might come through axis F54 and engage BX13 from its rear. Second, his assessment was that 2LT Ho had spotted BX13B to be at the junction ahead of F54 based on the radio communication of 2LT Ho “_I see your vehicle, your vehicle is in front of me correct?_”

158    I shall now examine the two assessments which the accused claimed operated on his mind which made the overtaking manoeuvre safe without the need to establish communication. It would be appropriate to begin by considering what the accused said when he was first asked to give his account of the incident. In the course of investigations, he was questioned over a period of more than five months, starting from the very day of the incident. A total of eight investigation statements were recorded before the cautioned statement. These were two statements which were recorded on 3 November 2018 (P17 and P18), followed by 5 November 2018 (P19), 13 November 2018 (P20), 4 December 2018 (P21), 8 February 2019 (D1), 15 February 2019 (P22) and 11 April 2019 (D2).

159    For the first two statements P17 and P18 which were recorded on the day of the incident, although the statements provide a fairly detailed account, the accused stated in his third statement that his mind was “in a blank” and he was “still unstable” when he made those statements. As the statements were recorded on the same day after what must have been a traumatic incident, I did not hold the contents of the first two statements against the accused.

160    The third statement on 5 November 2018 (P19), however, stood on a different footing. This is because the accused had contacted the investigation officer to provide a further statement. He stated that in the last two days, he had ‘revisited the events’ and he would like to make some additions to his statements so that he can be “very clear” to assist investigations. The accused provided a number of details relating to the collision in the further statement but he did not disclose that he ordered an overtake of the Bionix.

161    In the next statement of 13 November 2018 (P20), the accused was asked specifically to explain why he instructed the deceased to move forward after the Land Rover had stopped. His version then was that he gave instructions “_to move forward slightly so that he could shift his vehicle to the left to ensure that the Land Rover will not be directly behind the Bionix._” He intentionally suppressed or withheld the material fact that the Land Rover had driven forward because he ordered an overtaking and instead gave a false explanation. The only conclusion that can be drawn from this lie is that the accused was unable to explain how he had properly considered the situation before he ordered the overtaking.

162    In his statement of 8 February 2019 (D1), the accused was confronted with the investigation findings which established that he ordered the overtaking of BX13. He was shown an extract of the in camera footage of the Land Rover together with the radio communication. He was asked at Q3: “_What was your purpose of overtaking BX13?_” He answered: “_I can’t recall._” At Q4, he was asked if the overtaking was safe and if it was allowed. The accused answered: “_I can’t recall how come I gave the instruction to Liu Kai to overtake so I will not be able recall and explain if it would be safe for the Land Rover to overtake._” Asked by learned counsel why he was unable to provide a reason for overtaking in D1 and D2, the accused’s evidence (with reference to D1) for stating that he was unable to recall was “_I was surprised that I made the command to overtake_”. He went on to say that he was unable to recall because he was “in shock and in trauma”. He added that there was “this gap” in his memory.

163    There was an incoherence in the accused’s explanation. His evidence that he was ‘surprised’ that he gave the command squarely contradicted his assertion that he had assessed it to be safe before he gave the instruction to overtake. With respect to his claim of the ‘gap’ in his memory, statement D1 provided details of the events which preceded and followed the overtaking. He coincidentally lost recollection only of the overtaking. This is inherently implausible and I found his selective amnesia was deliberate.

164    In the statement recorded on 15 February 2019 (P22) at \[16\], the accused’s position was as follows: “_I cannot recall the rationale for ordering Liu Kai to bypass the Bionix. But I recall it may be due to something that I heard over the radio set. If possible, I would like to request to listen to the footage before I can explain the reason for ordering him to bypass the Bionix._”

165    On 11 April 2019, the accused contacted the investigation officer to allow him to watch the footage to jog his memory. The request was acceded to and he was shown both the in and out camera footage of the Land Rover between 09:49:55 to 09:52:10 with the radio communications. The accused’s evidence was that he viewed the footage “for quite a while”. Thereafter, he was asked in statement D2 to explain why he instructed the overtaking. The accused answered: “_I can’t recall, sorry. Some of the audio was muffled so I couldn’t make out some of the words spoken._”

166    The upshot of the statements is that for a period of slightly more than five months after the incident, the accused did not voluntarily disclose that he ordered the overtaking; when questioned specifically on why the Land Rover moved forward, he suppressed the fact that he had ordered the overtaking; and when confronted with incontrovertible evidence, he had selective amnesia. The irresistible conclusion must be that the accused was unable to explain how he had properly considered the situation before directing the overtaking.

167    On 16 May 2019, the accused provided his cautioned statement (D3). He knew prior to giving the statement that he will be charged because he had been informed by his superior. Based on the contents of statement D3, the accused spoke to two colleagues about the incident before he gave the statement. In a nutshell, his evidence was that his colleagues mentioned “along the line of North or coming from the North”, and he claimed his memory was trigged as a result. He asserted he was then able to remember this was the consideration when he performed the overtaking manoeuvre.

168    At \[8(5)\] of D3, he stated “_My vehicle was positioned on the North of BIONIX 13, which would compromise his location since the enemy was advancing from the North to the South._” At \[11\] of D3, he said as follows: “_I had wanted to move my vehicle to the opposite side of the junction to conceal myself from Kaffir Company Forces and observe from the opposite side of the junction._” In his evidence, he clarified he wanted to be at the Y Junction near F56. The accused had to be pressed several times on his equivocal answers on what he wanted to observe from that position. He finally stated he wanted to observe BX13’s ‘next action’. He was then pressed on what ‘next action’ he had anticipated or was considering. The accused said _“it was to observe what he was trying to do with BX13B at that point of time … and see what were his subsequent actions to try to link up with BX13B”_.

169    Asked about \[12(2)\] of D3 where he stated that BX13 was “defending at the wrong point of the junction”, he said he meant that he perceived the enemy was coming from the North and therefore BX13’s gun should have been pointing North. The accused was then cross-examined as follows[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21):

> Q    Right. So, we also heard yesterday that you said F fif---Lieutenant Ho was linking up with BX13B.

> A    Yes.

> Q    Right?

> A    Yes, that’s correct.

> Q    So, he cannot be defending and linking up with F13B---

> A    Yes---

> Q    right?

> A    that is correct.

> Q    Right. So, if that’s the case, then why are you saying that his---his gun was pointing in the wrong direction?

> A    Okay. So, what---

> Q    If he was trying to establish co---contact, shouldn’t he be looking forward?

> A    Yes, that is cor---that is correct. However, this was a result of his actions that his vehicle U-turned and went all the way towards---from one delay point to the other that led---allowed him to saw where, uh, his 13B was.

> …

> Q    The---the question is this.

> A    Mmm.

> Q    If you are trying to link up with somebody in front, shouldn’t you be looking in front rather than looking behind?

> A    Yes, that’s correct.

> …

> Q    So---so, what is this preoccupation with saying that BX13 was defending, he should be pointing behind? I just don’t understand this point.

> A    Okay. So, what I mean was that---you see, the thing with the actions of BX13 that was moving towards the South instead of reversing towards the South had let him see the vehicle in front of F63, which he perceived to be his B vehicle. Had he reversed all the way, yes, he might not have seen it, but his rear guide would have seen it.

> Q    You’re saying his rear guide occupying a lower position in the tank in height would have seen ahead of him?

> A    (pause – 00:00:08) Yes and no. It would depend in this situation, if the BX---the rear compart---as in the rear guide can spot from that position or---or not, I wouldn’t know. Because now, what you are presenting to me is a hypothetical situation.

> Q    Now, let me just put it in another way. Yesterday, you testified at length that there was a linking up.

> A    Yes.

> Q    In your Cautioned Statement---

> A    Yes.

> Q    was there any mention of a linking up?

> A    No.

> Q    Yes. So, why is that so?

> A    When I wrote this statement, it was based on my obser---observations on what he did---what he was observed as not practising the movement of reversing. So, my, um---and the thing is that, yes, uh, he might not reverse but because he s---saw this vehicle in front and I wanted to know what his next action would be, to link up or whether to just---perhaps, just to comms to further clarify, um, where the vehicle---where the vehicle could see him in relative to the oppos---of---of the vehicle’s position. I mean, I wanted to observe the next course of action that BX13 would do. In this statement, it was---I had written down this observation that, yah, he should be pointing towards the North.

170    The accused’s rambling response did not directly answer the question and does not show that he genuinely believed that there was going to be a ‘linking up’. First, if the accused had genuinely believed that there was going to be a ‘linking up’ between BX13 and BX13B which he intended to observe, then it would be reasonable to expect him to have included it in his six-page handwritten response to the charge. I found that the only logical explanation why he did not state it in D3 is because it was not a genuine reason. Second, the accused asserted he would have faced North at the Y Junction as he perceived the Kaffir Company forces were still up North. If that was indeed his assessment, he would have been facing in the opposite direction as the alleged ‘linking up’ was to take place in the South. In essence, the accused’s evidence was again incoherent and he took two inconsistent positions.

171    As regards the other reason that he perceived the enemy to come from the North and his memory was triggered in that regard, he gave the following answers under cross-examination[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22):

> Q    Right. Now, I am coming to the explanation that you were triggered to remember, right? I’m coming to this part. Now, I---I---I am putting it to you that this claim that you were triggered by the word “North” or “from the North” really makes no sense. I mean, it’s---it’s my---my put to you that it---it is---it’s an incredible claim by you.

> A    (pause – 00:00:10) You mean that it makes no sense in triggering my memory or it makes no sense from the wording itself?

> Q    It makes no sense in triggering---triggering your memory.

> A    I disagree.

> Q    Right. And why I said that is because---because the whole exercise was already premised on Kaffir forces moving from the North to the South. This---this is the whole event. Do you agree?

> A    I agree it was the whole event.

> Q    Yes.

> A    From the Kaffir Company moving from the North to the South.

> Q    Yes. So, if that’s the case, so, why would a word like, from your---from your colleagues, “North to the South”, then suddenly trigger your memory?

> A    (pause – 00:00:21) As for the reason why the words suddenly trigger my memory, I cannot explain why. However, I just wish to put on this case that it was a traumatic experience and I was in the vehicle all along until the Bionix stopped.

It is unsurprising the accused was unable to explain how the mention of the word ‘North’ could have triggered his memory. The direction in which the Kaffir Company forces were advancing was patently obvious. The accused was able to describe from the outset in his statement P18, which was recorded on the day of the incident, that the OPFOR forces were facing North and were defending against the Kafir Company Forces which were moving South (see \[8\]). Accordingly, I found the accused’s explanation that his memory was triggered by the word ‘North’ to be unbelievable.

172    Further, if the accused’s belief at the material time had been that the Kaffir Company forces were still in the North and he was contemplating the Kaffir Company forces to come down via the axis at F53, it was odd that he followed BX13 into F54. In response to my questions to elicit an explanation, he gave the following answers[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23):

> 
| 

Court:

 | 

Okay. So, if that is the case, then can you explain why you positioned yourself behind BX13 if you expected it to come from F53.

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Oh, so, um, sorry, Your Honour, the question was why did I position myself behind BX13?

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Okay. So, BX13 had already moved down.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

So, what I did was to just to, um, do a U-turn to follow his, um, retreat route.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

I understand that.

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Mmm.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

But you see, you are expecting a fight to come from the direction of F53. Then wouldn’t you be in the way?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Yes, that’s correct.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Yes. So, now, my question is why---why did you then position yourself there?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

(pause – 00:01:11) I---okay, so from what I can recall, how come I was positioned over here, um, behind BX13, was that I was expecting BX13 to go back all the way to F64B, before he---when, um, that was my, uh, I was expecting myself to follow BX13 all the way to F64B. However, when I reached this point over here, um, I saw that his vehicle had stopped. So, subsequently, I also stopped my vehicle to observe what BX13 was doing.

 |

  
  

The answer revealed that the accused was not contemplating any attack from the rear at F54. Instead, it is clear that his emphasis was towards the South where BX13 was headed.

173    Moreover, the accused knew that BX13 made an unexpected stop before the junction F54. It is clear from the radio communication between 09:51:10 to 09:51:37 that BX13 was trying to ascertain the location of BX13B and if it had encountered any Kaffir Company forces. At 09:51:39, 3SG Koh said he was retrograding all the way back to line Odysseus. This would have placed 3SG Koh at or near to the last delay line in the Western sector. After about five seconds, 2LT Ho asked, “_I see your vehicle, your vehicle is in front of me correct?_” In response, 3SG Koh said, “_I never see you.”_ The accused claimed that based on what 2LT Ho said, he believed that 2LT Ho had spotted BX13B. The accused was given a chance to listen to the radio communication at his request when he gave his statement D2. If this communication was significant as to inform his assessment that the vehicle in front was not an enemy vehicle, then he ought reasonably to have remembered it and mentioned it in his statement D2. His mind was also surprisingly not triggered when he gave his cautioned statement D3. I found that the accused had latched onto the communication as an afterthought to justify his decision to overtake.

174    I found that what 2LT Ho said cannot reasonably be interpreted to mean that he must have seen BX13B. The accused conceded under cross-examination that he could not be certain if it was in fact BX13B. The reasonable interpretation must be that 2LT Ho was uncertain and he was asking 3SG Koh if he was correct. If the accused had taken it literally as he claimed he did (which I do not believe because I find that he would have known that BX13B could not have been in that location) then it would have been a rash conclusion. A moment’s thought would have indicated that BX13B could not possibly be at F63 because 3SG Koh had about five seconds earlier stated that he was retrograding to line Odysseus. This clearly meant that he was near to the final delay point or had reached it at the Western sector. The communication by 3SG Koh of his location confirmed that he was proceeding according to the plan. Accordingly, it would have been apparent to the accused that BX13B could not have ended up in the Eastern sector and travelled down the axis at F63.

175    I turn now to consider the other objective circumstances which show what the accused ought to have known or knew. The accused conceded he was aware that the Kaffir Company Forces were likely to exploit the gap in the Eastern sector by the ‘destruction’ of BX13A. In this regard, it was his evidence that he advised 2LT Ho to cover the Eastern sector so that the Kafir Company forces would not be able to passage to the South easily. This was because there were multiple axes which could be exploited from Malcom 1 down to either Nissan, Ferrari, Rado or Onion to the junctions at F41, F40, F39, F38 and F36 to advance to the South.

176    At 09:42:12 and 09:42:26, whilst at Wira, 2LT Ho said, “currently I hear vehicle”. There is no dispute that this meant that 2LT Ho only heard the engine of a Bionix which was in the vicinity but he did not see any Bionix. The accused was asked if he too heard the sound of the engine, but he claimed that he was unable to recall. Asked where the Bionix which 2LT Ho heard was, the accused said he believed 2LT Ho was referring to the axis leading to F32 because he said “I’m going to contact”. The accused conceded that he did not know if 2LT Ho was able to see the F32 axis due to the curvature and vegetation.

177    About four minutes and 27 seconds thereafter, 2LT Ho warned BX13B that a vehicle was most likely coming towards it. It must have been clear at this stage to the accused that 2LT Ho was not referring to F32. At 9:48:44, 2LT Ho radioed sounding anxious, “1,3 Bravo pull back pull back pull back. 1, 3 Bravo pull back to Odysseus now”. He repeated the command to BX13B to pull back to Odysseus at 09:49:02 and said he was also pulling back too. At 09:49:41, 2LT Ho repeated the same command to BX13B.

178    At first, the accused said that 2LT Ho ordered the retreat to the last delay line because he had ‘spent a good 15 minutes’ at F40. However, when it was pointed out to him that 2LT Ho had specifically stated that an enemy vehicle was most likely coming towards BX13B, he then said that 2LT Ho may have spotted a vehicle or he knew that a vehicle was nearby. I agreed with the prosecution’s submissions that the accused must have been aware at this stage that the Kaffir Company forces were close-by which prompted 2LT Ho’s retreat to the last delay line.

179    In this regard, the subsequent events at about 09:49:44 are critical. Ahead from where the accused was between F41 and F40, a Bionix can be seen crossing at the Toyota-Ferrari axis. This axis was within the accused’s line of sight. From the footage, the accused was looking straight ahead and he told the deceased in the next second at 09:49:45, “_Ah come, we (unclear) need to go already._” Before the Land Rover moved off, another Bionix can be seen crossing at the same axis and the accused was still looking ahead in its direction.

180    The accused gave two reasons for allegedly not observing the Bionix vehicles. First, he said that he did not focus on the junction beyond F40. Second, he said “I mean the size and colour of the BX, I just did not notice”. From the footage, it is clear the accused is looking up at the junction ahead at the material time. The accused accepted that he was looking up. In fact, the footage shows that he had a constant gaze in the direction of the second Bionix. From the footage, the visibility is clear and the accused’s view of the axis ahead was unobstructed. Further, the distance of the axis was between 200 to 300 meters away, as testified to by COL Tang. I rejected the evidence of the accused that he only focussed on the immediate junction. There is no convincing reason provided for this emphasis. I found that he took this position simply to assert that the risk of enemy vehicles in the South which could be crossing at F63 was low. I found that the irresistible inference is that the accused saw at least two Kaffir Company Bionix vehicles which were headed South along the Toyota-Ferrari axis. This was a fairly straight and direct route down to the South leading to F63 and eventually to F64 which the accused had appreciation of.

181    The accused knew that BX13 had stopped unexpectedly before F54. It had slowed down before coming to a stop. A moment’s thinking would have made it apparent that there was uncertainty ahead and 2LT Ho was assessing the situation. There was thus a real risk that BX13 would not remain stationary. The accused knew that BX13B was in the Western sector and 3SG Koh had reported his location less than two minutes earlier. The accused knew that there was no linking up planned at F63. It was thus highly unlikely for BX13B to be at F63. The accused had seen the two Bionix vehicles crossing at the Toyota-Ferrari axis and it would have been reasonable to consider that the vehicles had reached F63 before 2LT Ho. It is not in dispute that the accused was unable to see what was in front of BX13 and the axis. It is undisputed that the curvature in the axis and the thick vegetation blocked his view ahead.

182    The general ambiguity and uncertainty of the situation which made the decision to overtake unsafe was highlighted by COL Tang. He elaborated as follows[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24):

> Q    Okay. Are you able to give more specific elaboration on---on why exactly it would be not safe with reference to what---what we’ve seen earlier, or Captain Ong has seen earlier?

> A    Yah, I mean, we---when, uh---if we do, um---if the possibilities, Your Honour, of an imminent firefight, uh, is likely or if---I mean, if the firefight is possible, uh, that means, we anticipate a certain amount of---of drills undertaken by---by the vehicles. And therefore, given, uh, the uncertainty of what lies ahead, um, the actions cannot be---be reasonably anticipated uh, putting ourselves into the mixture of this scenario is unsafe.

> Q    I see.

> A    Bringing a vehicle into an area where drills are likely going to be undertaken by a Bionix is unsafe.

> Q    I see. And so, if overtaking is unsafe, then the Rover should be maintaining the safety distance of 30 metres instead, correct?

> A    Yes.

> Q    Okay. And just to tie things up, if the situation is such that it is unsafe to overtake, then it is irrelevant whether there is enough clearance, enough width to effect the overtaking, correct?

> A    That is correct.

183    I did not find the evidence of the four defence witnesses to assist the accused. They testified that it is unsafe to overtake if there is a risk that the front vehicle may move. All four witnesses also placed emphasis on having clear frontage visibility. Whilst the witnesses said they were not taught that is necessary to establish communication before overtaking, DW2-CPT Joel, had come across various practices of establishing communication like the sounding of the horn, dismounting, catching the attention of the rear guide or vehicle commander through line of sight. He agreed it is good practice to establish communication in a situation where it is unclear if the vehicle to be overtaken will remain stationary. DW3-CPT Wong has also seen others establishing communication in some situations, example, when there is a bend in the axis that is in front or if the space is relatively tight although there was a two meter clearance. DW5-Lai stated that he would establish communication if he did not have a fontal view and if he was unable to assess it was safe to overtake.

184    In _Muhammad Khalis bin Ramlee v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 449</span> (‘_Muhammad Khalis’_), the High Court held at \[34\] that “_Although rashness generally requires some form of subjective awareness, it is sufficient that the accused is aware of a real (as opposed to a theoretical or fanciful) risk of a particular consequence occurring, even if the accused perceives that risk to be small or ultimately unlikely to eventuate._” Generally, the precise state of mind of a person is incapable of ascertainment. The two reasons that the accused provided which he claimed influenced his decision that the overtaking would be safe were mutually inconsistent. I also found the reasons were not genuine and they could not have operated on his mind.

185    The irresistible and natural inference from all the coexistent facts is that it would have been obvious to the accused that when BX13 stopped unexpectedly before junction 54, there was uncertainty ahead and a real possibility that it had spotted Kaffir Company forces ahead. Consequently there was a real risk that BX13 may move or reverse as part of the extrication drill, and it was therefore unsafe to overtake without establishing communication. Therefore, the only conclusion is that the accused was conscious of the safety risks of overtaking without first establishing communication. He may have believed that the Land Rover would be able to overtake before BX13 moved, but in running the risk of overtaking when he had no clear frontage visibility, the indifference towards the real risk would still constitute rashness.

## Was the accused merely negligent?

186    Given that the accused was not able to see what was ahead of BX13 coupled with the real risk that BX13 had sighted an enemy vehicle, the accused’s deliberate decision to overtake notwithstanding the real risk that BX13 may not remain stationary carried clear safety risks. It cannot therefore be said to be merely negligence or a poor error of judgment. There are no extenuating factors as the accused was not required to make a rushed decision. He was in a position where he could have carefully assessed the situation to eliminate the uncertainty or established communication with 2LT Ho before taking a decision. As he chose to overtake despite the clear risk which the situation presented, the state of mind of the accused was therefore undoubtedly rash.

## Causation

187    Causation is an essential ingredient of the offence in that the rash act of the accused must have caused the death.

188    The test for causation was considered in _Ng Keng Yong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 4 SLR(R) 89</span>, where the appellants were officers who served on a Republic of Singapore Navy Ship _RSS Courageous_ (“the Navy ship”). They were charged under s 304A of the Penal Code for negligently navigating the Navy Ship where its four crewmembers lost their lives. It was found by the district judge that certain negligent actions which the appellants took in the course of navigation resulted in a collision between the Navy Ship and a merchant vessel, _ANL Indonesia_ (‘the ANL’). It was found that the _ANL_ also had been negligent in the actions that it took to alter its course in response to the Navy Ship’s negligent actions. Yong Pung How CJ concluded that while the _ANL’s_ negligent act was a contributing cause of the accident, it did not break the chain of causation. He explained his decision as follows (at \[64\] and \[66\]):

> 64    … \[T\]he question before me was whether the appellants’ negligent alteration to port in breach of r 14(a) of the Collision Regulations constituted the proximate and efficient cause of the collision, or whether the _ANL_’s undisputed contributory negligence intervened to break the chain of causation.

> …

> 66    … Proceeding on both principle and logic, it is evident that criminal liability under s 304A should attach to the person(s) whose negligence contributed substantially, and not merely peripherally, to the result. When Chua J observed that the accused’s act should be the proximate and efficient cause of the result without the intervention of another’s negligence, he was merely emphasising the point that the accused’s negligence, and not the negligence of any other person, should have contributed significantly to the result. If he meant to suggest that the chain of causation was necessarily broken by the very fact of a third party’s intervening negligence, then, with the greatest respect, I cannot agree. The particulars of the factual matrix, and the extent to which the third party’s negligence contributed to the deaths, have to be assessed as well. The court must ultimately direct its mind to whether the negligence of the accused contributed significantly or substantially to the result.

189    The inquiry in relation to causation is therefore directed at whether the offending actions of the accused had been the substantial cause of the death which resulted even if there were other contributing causes. This position was adopted in _Guay Seng Tiong Nickson v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 1079</span> (“_Nickson Guay_”) by Menon CJ who stated at \[36\]:

> _Ng Keng Yong_ demonstrates that the mere presence of multiple causes that all contribute to occasion the death may not be sufficient to relieve a negligent actor of criminal liability even if one of those other contributing causes was the negligent act of the victim or of a third party. For the purposes of a charge under s 304A, the court does not look to ascertain which of the contributing causes can be said to be the _most_ substantial cause. Instead, its concern is whether the act of the accused was a substantial cause of the death such that it can be said to be a proximate and efficient cause of the injury.

> \[emphasis in original\]

190    Hence, what I was required to determine is whether the accused’s conduct was a substantial cause of the death. In this regard, it will also be apposite to refer to \[38\] of _Nickson Guay_ where the test was elaborated as follows:

> Hence, in order to escape _liability_, it is not sufficient for the accused to point to the fact that there are other contributing causes. All the prosecution has to show is that the accused is a substantial cause of the injury even if there were other contributing causes. I should add that I use the term “substantial cause” because it was the expression used in _Ng Keng Yong_ (\[34\] supra) at \[71\]. The test for causation has been variously articulated in other parts of the Commonwealth, with expressions such as “not insignificant”, “more than de minimis”, or “significant contribution” having been used to convey the same notion that an accused’s act must be a significant cause of death in order for liability to attach (see _R v Nette_ \[2001\] 3 SCR 488 at \[4\]; _R v Smithers_ \[1978\] 1 SCR 506; _Royall v The Queen_ \[1991\] 100 ALR 669; _R v Pagett_ (1983) 76 Cr App R 279 at 288 per Robert Goff LJ; _R v Cato_ \[1976\] 1 All ER 260 at 266d per Lord Widgery CJ; _R v Cheshire_ at 852A). I also note that there are some who consider that these are not merely semantic differences (see Stanley Yeo, “Causation in Criminal and Civil Negligence”, (2007) 25 Sing L Rev 108 and see also the observations of Lord Sumner in _British Columbia Electric Railway Company, Limited v Loach_ <span class="citation">\[1916\] 1 AC 719</span> at 727–728) but as none of this is in issue before me, I say no more on this.

191    In _Chong Chee Boon Kenneth_, it was undisputed that the national serviceman was pushed into the well. The defence contended, _inter alia_, that the push broke the chain of causation as it was unexpected and not reasonably foreseeable that physical force would be resorted to. The High Court held at \[63\]:

> … the doctrine of _novus actus interveniens_ could assist the court to decide if the act of the accused was a substantial cause of the harm such that it can be said to be a sufficiently proximate and efficient cause of the harm. After all, it is trite that liability will not attach where the harm (or damage) is caused by some “overwhelming supervening act” by a third party perpetrator which no one in the accused’s shoes could have reasonably foreseen would happen (see _R v Anderson_; _R v Morris_ \[1966\] 2 All ER 644 at p 648E; _R v Jogee_; _Ruddock v The Queen_ \[2017\] AC 387 at \[97\]).

#### Left steer by BX13

192    I turn now to the issue of whether there is a sufficient nexus between the act of the accused and the death. The accused has blamed BX13 for the death by alleging that it changed course whilst reversing which brought it into the path of the Land Rover. Based on the footage of the incident and the animation done by the HSA, it is clear that when BX13 started to reverse, the Land Rover was not in its direct path. It is also apparent that in the course of reversing, the driver had made a steer to the left which brought it into the path of the Land Rover. The question is whether this is sufficient to break the chain of causation.

193    After the shots were fired at the enemy, the driver was required to reverse immediately upon command by 2LT Ho. The reversal is a necessary step of the extrication drill which required immediate and rapid action on the part of the driver. It is undisputed that the Land Rover was 16 to 18 meters behind BX13 at that stage and it took about eight seconds for BX13 to mount the Land Rover. As BX13 started to reverse, 3SG Tay, who was the Side Machine Gunner and rear guide had used his hand to signal to the Land Rover to move back due to its proximity. 3SG Tay explained that he had signalled “_Because based on my previous, uh, outfield that I never see a Bio---uh, a vehicle that is parked that distance away from us when we were doing, uh, like, combat mission._” Despite the proximity, the Land Rover remained where it was.

194    The general rule is for the driver to reverse straight without any command from the rear guide. The driver, CPL Lim, explained that this was precisely what he had tried to do by taking reference from the kerb. The steer to the left was made for that purpose and not to make any material change to its course. The evidence of the Exercise supervising officer, COL Tang, is relevant to determine if CPL Lim was permitted to do that. He was asked by learned counsel under cross-examination[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25):

> Q    Now, you agree that there is an obvious shift in direction?

> A    Um, Your Honour, I would say I observed a---a slight shift in direction. Um, Your Honour, I would also say that given the context of the width of the axis and where the Bionix was moving rearwards towards, um, this shift in direction is, uh---is fine. There is nothing wrong with this particular movement---

> Q    I didn’t ask that ques---

> A    as compared to something where the vehicle is steered very heavily towards the left or the right.

> Q    I didn’t ask that question Mr. Tang, I appreciate if you just answered the question.

> A    Yes, Counsel, what is the question?

> Q    I wanted to ask is it permissible to change direction like for the driver to steer or to cause the vehicle to change direction without any command?

> A    I would say, Your Honour, the---the video footage has shown that the vehicle was reversing, and how the vehicle was reversing seems fine to me. It is not a case where the vehicle had steered to the left or to the right.

> Q    My question is I shall repeat it. Is it permissible for the driver to shift direction without any command?

> A    The driver cannot change the direction of the vehicle steering without a command from the vehicle commander or in this case the rear guide.

> Q    Do you agree that the Bionix has changed direction?

> A    I would say given what I’ve observed, Your Honour, in the footage, it is still in the act of reversing. It was not a case where the steering was significantly altered.

> Q    Question of degree, but the question remains the same. Do you agree there was a change in direction?

> A    I agree that there was a shift in direction. But I would also say, Your Honour that the direction is generally in the rearward direction.

> Q    Would it su---would it surprise you---you the driver had change or shift direction without receiving any command?

> A    I would say that if the driver was---like what our earlier discussion was, Your Honour, making adjustments to where he was visually aligned to, uh, that is certainly within permissible ranges.

195    COL Tang has clearly testified that the adjustment was permissible. As he said, there was no “heavy” steer and “\[i\]t was not a case where the steering was significantly altered”. In fact, the rear guide did not even realise that there was a left steer during the process. I found the steer cannot therefore be said to amount to a material change of course. Accordingly, I found that there is nothing which can be described as unreasonable or unwarrantable in the reversal.

196    I found the collision was the natural consequence of the lack of safe distance for the Bionix to execute its extrication manoeuvre which was caused by the Land Rover’s failure to adhere to the 30 meter safety distance stated in the TSR and its failure to communicate its intention to overtake when it was unsafe to do so. The duty of ensuring the safety distance and to communicate was the responsibility of the accused. I did not find the action of CPL Lim to eclipse the accused’s wrongdoing and thereby break the chain of causation. I found that it was the actions of the accused which were the substantial or the proximate and efficient cause of the demise of CFC Liu.

197    The defence sought to establish the accident would nevertheless have occurred if the Land Rover had remained at its initial position of 30 meters. This hypothetical argument is a disingenuous attempt to avoid the consequences of the accused’s own failure to maintain the safety distance.

#### Breakdown in communication

198    Based on the report P15, the ‘Audio signal’ was ‘OK’, which meant the CVC helmet was able to hear messages. 3SG Tay would thus have been able to hear messages. As to whether the other crew were able to hear 3SG Tay, he testified he had tested his CVC helmet on the day of the incident by speaking into the intercom with CPL Lim and CPL Chan and they were both able to hear him. His evidence was supported by CPL Lim and CPL Chan. Moreover, there was no evidence that prior to the incident, the other crew were unable to hear 3SG Tay or CPL Lim did not follow his directions when reversing. In fact, the evidence of the crew was that there was no issue with the communications. It is significant that the accused also did not testify that there was an issue with the intercom system of BX13.

199    Specifically, the Vehicle Commander, 2LT Ho, gave the following evidence in cross-examination when asked about the findings on the rear guide’s CVC helmet[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26):

> Q    In particular, there was a finding that the rear guide’s CVC helmet was faulty in terms of the intercom capability. Were you aware of that?

> A    No, I was not. During the exercise, uh, I could communicate with everyone in the crew.

> …

> Q    … So, my question to you, Mr Ho, is that do you maintain that on that day, 3rd November 2018,you were able to communicate with the rear guide?

> A    Yes, we were. So, initially, before we moved out, we did a communication check and I was able to communicate with the side MG as well as on the various---for the various delay points where we did the reverse, he was able to communicate with both myself and the driver as well. And even up till the point of the accident, I could hear the side MG, uh, saying “stop”.

> Q    So, you---you don’t know why we had this finding here?

> A    Yes. Uh, if at any point in time during the exercise, I am not able to communicate with the side MG, or as a matter of fact any of the crew, we will stop the vehicle to address the issue before we continue.

> …

> A    So, before the incident---the prior reverses that we did, went smoothly without any issues, so the---the side MG managed to get the BX where we needed to be and the driver was able to, uh, listen to the side MG and do so.

It is therefore clear on 2LT Ho’s evidence that 3SG Tay’s ‘Mic Signal’ could not have been ‘open’ as it was working at the start and during the Exercise. In fact, when 2LT Ho got off the radio communications channel, he heard 3SG Tay’s shouts of ‘stop’ through the intercom ‘up till the point of the accident’. 2LT Ho responded by instinctively shouting ‘stop’ into the intercom although he did not know what was going on.

200    Further, CPL Lim also testified that the CVC helmets were tested on the day of the incident and the helmets were functioning well. He was able to hear 3SG Tay during the Exercise prior to the incident. His evidence on his communication with 3SG Tay prior to the incident is set out below[\[note: 27\]](#Ftn_27):

> A    Um, uh, there were several occasions that I found---I found that my gunner uh, Zhao Yong, and my rear guide, Cheng Jun, their voices were, um, quite soft. And I will let them know and ask them to repeat themselves or to speak louder. Other than that, there will often have, uh, like ambient noise, engine noise, and, yah.

> Q    Okay. Just to clarify your answer. You said that there were several occasions where you found that your gunner’s voice, Zhao Yong’s voice, as well as your rear guide’s voice, Cheng Jun’s voice was soft, so you ask them to repeat and speak louder?

> A    Yes.

> Q    But were you still able to hear them the first time around?

> A    Yes, I was still able to hear them.

> Q    And other than that, you mentioned that there was ambient noise and engine noise.

> A    Yes.

> Q    Did this affect you---whether you were able to hear your crew members?

> A    No.

> Q    So, apart from these 2 things that you have mentioned, the volume as well as the ambient noise, were there any other issues in relation to the intercoms?

> A    No.

Whilst CPL Lim found the voice of 3SG Tay to be soft, this by itself was immaterial. First, CPL Lim made the same observation with regard to CPL Chan’s voice. Second, he was able to hear 3SG Tay the first time round. He also said the communication was ‘relatively clear’ after he told 3SG Tay and CPL Chan to speak louder. Whilst CPL Lim was unable to hear the ‘stop’ commands by 3SG Tay prior to the collision and was hearing only a static buzz, what is significant is that he heard both 3SG Tay and 2LT Ho shouting ‘stop’ after his Bionix came to a stop. His evidence-in-chief was as follows[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28):

> A    So, I continued reversing for approximately 1 to 2 seconds, that’s when the lift got higher and---and I felt that something was wrong. So, I stopped on my own accord, but the---but at the same time, I heard, um, the shouting, uh---shouting of “stop, stop, stop” from my vehicle commander and my rear guide.

> Q    So, you said that at the same time, you heard the shouting, “stop, stop, stop” from vehicle commander and the rear guide?

> A    Yes.

> Q    Can I just confirm whether this was heard through the CVC or just the surrounding noise?

> A    It was through my CVC.

In cross-examination, he reiterated that he heard 3SG Tay and 2LT Ho shouting ‘stop’ via the intercom of the CVC. The questions and answers are set out below[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29):

> Q    So, you stopped. Now, at this point in time, you heard shouting from your rear guide and vehicle commander through the CVC?

> A    Yes, at the same time when I stopped.

> Q    This is the first time you are hearing, the first time you are hearing their voices from the time you started this reverse manoeuvre, is that right?

> A    Yes.

> Q    During that---those few seconds, you did not hear the voices at all, shouting at you?

> A    No, I did not.

> Q    Your vehicle commander is seated somewhere on top of you, isn’t it?

> A    Yes.

> Q    You could not hear him even if he were to shout very loudly?

> A    No.

201    CPL Chan also testified that the CVC helmets were functioning during the testing. Very significantly, he heard 3SG Tay shouting ‘stop’ through the CVC intercom. His evidence in cross-examination was as follows[\[note: 30\]](#Ftn_30):

> Q    Now, this shouting of “stop, stop” from the rear guide, it was through the intercom that you’re hearing?

> A    Yes.

> Q    And not shouting sound that you---you hear from the rear of the Bionix?

> A    No.

202    During the technical examination, the ‘Mic Signal’ Pin was found to be ‘open’ due to defects in the bailout cable. The defects were not as a result of wear and tear but were due to the ‘placement of bailout cables on locations susceptible to weight of heavy equipment or force acting on the cable pressed against some edges’. The incident happened on 3 November 2018 and the CVC helmet was tested on 9 November 2018 by officers from CID. There was no evidence adduced on how the CVC helmet was stored in the interim. Considering the totality of the evidence before me, I had no reason to doubt the reliability of the evidence of 2LT Ho and his crew that they were able to hear 3SG Tay. On CPL Lim’s evidence, there was a brief interruption of his intercom, but he was able to hear 3SG Tay after he had stopped. Accordingly, this was not a scenario where the crew of BX13 had acted unreasonably in carrying on with the Exercise knowing that there was a breakdown in communication. The weight of the evidence clearly showed that there was an intermittent failure in the intercom communication.

203    It is uncontentious that CPL Lim did not hear the ‘stop’ command and was not able to bring BX13 to an immediate stop which may have avoided the collision. In my view, this failure to stop cannot be singled out as the causation in law. It was merely a link in the events created by the accused’s attempt to overtake when it was unsafe to do so and thereby breaching the safety distance which is necessary to allow for reaction time to avoid collisions. BX13 attempted to respond to the lack of safety distance by the rear guide first waiving off the Land Rover. When the Land Rover did not move, he started to give the “stop” commands. As regards BX13’s attempts to cope with the lack of safety distance, I find the following passage cited in _Ng Keng Yong_ to be apposite:

> As Lord Pearce opined in The “Miraflores” and the “Abadesa” \[1967\] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 191 at 200 (sub nom Miraflores (Owners) v George Livanos (Owners) <span class="citation">\[1967\] 1 AC 826</span> at 847–848): It is axiomatic that a person who embarks on a deliberate act of negligence should, in general, bear a greater degree of fault than one who fails to cope adequately with the resulting crisis which is thus thrust upon him … For all humans can refrain from deliberately breaking well-known safety rules; but ’tis not in mortals to command the perfect reaction to a crisis; and many fall short at times of that degree which reasonable care demands. \[emphasis added\]

204    In my view, the accused’s pointing of the finger at the crew of BX13 was without merit. The effective or proximate cause was the lack of the safety distance which was created by the accused’s act of overtaking when it was unsafe to do so. The failure on the part of BX13 to stop in response to the situation created by the accused cannot break the chain of causation. In the upshot, I agreed with the submission of the prosecution at \[88\] of its closing submissions:

> More crucially, CPT Ong’s act of ordering the overtaking manoeuvre brought the Land Rover within the space intended for the BX13 to manoeuvre freely to perform their combat drills, including the extrication drill. As mentioned above, one of the key purposes of the 30 m safety distance rule is to allow a combat vehicle the freedom of action within the 30 m radius afforded by the rule.116 This is particularly necessary in combat scenarios, where speed and efficiency are of the essence, and where the Bionix IFV crew are expected to be able to perform their drills instinctively to enhance their survivability. In the words of then Chief Justice Yong Pung How in _Ng Keng Yong_ at \[71\], it was CPT Ong who “created the situation of danger” to begin with, and the collision that thereafter occurred was precisely an eventuation of the risk he ran in rashly ordering the overtaking manoeuvre.

205    Accordingly, I was satisfied that the charge was proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

## Address on Sentence

206    The prosecution sought a sentence of nine months’ imprisonment for the accused’s role in the tragedy. It was urged upon me that ‘this will signal the public’s strong disapprobation of SAF personnel taking unnecessary risk during peacetime training operations’.

207    It was submitted that the primary sentencing consideration is the degree of rashness exhibited by the accused (_Public Prosecutor v Tiyatun & Anor_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 SLR(R) 746</span> (‘_Tiyatun_’)). The accused as a Platoon Trainer was responsible for ensuring the safety of the deceased as well as the three OPFOR Bionix vehicles. It was averred that he undertook a high degree of risk when he ordered the overtaking, which was evident from his failure to appreciate numerous factors which made the potential risks evident. In this regard, the learned DPP relied on my findings which were summarised as follows:

> a)     At junction F40, the accused must have been aware that the Kaffir Company forces were close-by, and this prompted 2LT Ho’s retreat to the last delay line.

> b)     While moving off from F40, he saw at least two Kaffir Company Bionix vehicles which were headed South along the Toyota-Ferrari axis.

> c)     He knew that BX13 had stopped unexpectedly before junction F54 and even a “moment’s thinking” would have made it apparent that there was uncertainty South of BX13, and thus a real risk that BX13 would not remain stationary.

> d)     The accused was unable to see what was in front of BX13 and the axis.

> e)     A moment’s thought would have indicated that it could not possibly be BX13B that was at F63.

208    It was submitted that the sentencing framework for s 304A(a) Penal Code offences in the context of fatal road traffic accidents set out in _Public Prosecutor v Ganesan Sivasankar_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 681</span> (‘_Ganesan’)_ is inapplicable. The reason provided for the inapplicability was that the military training exercise which was inherently different in nature involved a greater level of risk as a result of the involvement of military vehicles within the training area.

209    The prosecution relied on the offender-specific aggravating factor of lack of remorse. It was submitted that the accused had prioritised his self-preservation during investigations by purportedly being unable to recall crucial details of his offending act until he was confronted with irrefutable evidence of the same. It was said the accused’s clean record is a neutral factor. As regards the potential professional or contractual consequences arising from the conviction, it was submitted that these were irrelevant to sentencing (_Stansilas Fabian Kester v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 755</span> at \[111\]).

## Mitigation

210    The accused’s father works at Sembwaste as a driver and his mother is a housewife. In order to support himself, the accused begun working part-time at the age of 16. His military career as a SAF regular began in 2011. His university education at Nanyang Technological University was sponsored by SAF. It was submitted that the accused has served dutifully to the best of his abilities in the SAF. He has had no disciplinary issues and was consistently ranked highly among his fellow officers.

211    Testimonials given by his superiors and peers were tendered. It was submitted that they show the accused was not a military officer who was ‘cavalier’ or ‘compromises on his work’ but ‘one who dutifully discharged his duties to the SAF’. In addition, it was submitted it can be deduced that the accused ‘was not the kind of commander who acts in disregard for the safety and needs of those placed under him’ but ‘one who sacrificially placed the needs of those under his charge above his own comfort’.

212    Learned counsel submitted for a ‘nominal’ sentence, or in the alternative a sentence of not more than three months’ imprisonment. It was contended that the accused’s culpability is low. There were three points that were made by the defence. First, it was submitted that the lack of ‘any subjective appreciation of the risks should surely suggest lower culpability’ and should be distinguished from road traffic accidents where the risks of taking certain courses of action are patently obvious.

213    Second, it was submitted that the act of overtaking did not in and of itself cause the accident but “it was the confluence of the 3 factors, which, acting together, resulted in the unfortunate accident”. In this regard, the three factors were the Land Rover was below the required safety distance of 30 metres, the left steer while reversing brought BX13 into the path of the Land Rover, and the intercom failure resulted in the rear guide’s “stop” commands not being heard. It was submitted that the ‘actions of a third party would be relevant in sentencing where it increased the likelihood of the accident happening as the accused would be deemed less culpable’.

214    Third, it was highlighted that there is no explicit rule which prohibited overtaking without first establishing communication.

215    As regards the precedents, it was submitted that the present case is distinguishable from _Public Prosecutor v Ng Chin Fong_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGDC 12</span> and _Balakrishnan S and another v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 4 SLR(R) 249</span> (‘the Commando dunking cases’) and _Chong Chee Boon Kenneth_ (‘the SCDF ragging case’), as those cases involved conduct which was expressly prohibited and done in the calm. In contrast, the accused’s decision to overtake was made in the midst of a dynamic exercise which required constant attention and re-evaluation of the situation. It was said that he had merely made a poor judgment call in the ‘heat of the battle’.

216    It was argued that the case is analogous to _Ng Keng Yong_, in which the offenders who were operating a naval ship in open sea were involved in a collision with another vessel. It was said the accused’s culpability may be said to be one that is more akin to negligence rather than rashness. Learned counsel referred to the sentencing framework for s 304A(a) in _Ganesan_ and submitted that there is no basis to disregard the framework. It was said that whilst the accident in a military exercise was not analogous to a road accident, this particular military exercise which did not involve live ammunition was not more dangerous than driving on civilian roads. Learned counsel submitted that the accused’s culpability should be considered low and a sentence of no more than three months’ imprisonment would be sufficient.

## Sentence

217    The offence carries an imprisonment term of up to five years, or with fine, or with both.

218    There is generally strong public interest in the loss of life which occurs during national service training, and for national service to retain public confidence and support, the sentencing objectives must be retribution and general deterrence.

219    The two principal parameters in evaluating the seriousness of an offence are: (a) the harm caused by the offence, and (b) the accused’s culpability. In the context of an offence under s 304A(a) of the Penal Code, the harm caused by the offence is, by definition, the death of the victim.

220    The level of culpability turns on (a) the degree of risk taken – the greater the risk, the more reprehensible the conduct and generally the more severe the sentence would be, and (b) the extent to which the accused appreciated the risk and correspondingly disregarded it. It was held in _Ganesan_, that it is not correct “to say that rashness involving a subjective consciousness of risk will invariably entail greater culpability than rashness involving an objective consciousness of risk.” (see \[26\])

221    On my findings, there was uncertainty on what lay ahead and an obvious risk that BX13 had sighted an enemy vehicle, and there was therefore a significant risk to overtake without establishing communications. As it was unsafe to overtake, the accused had by failing to keep to the safety distance breached the TSR. These facts constituted the rashness which was an essential ingredient of the offence. Unlike the Commando dunking cases and the SCDF ragging cases where the activities were done with deliberation and were prolonged, the accused’s decision was, as the defence submitted, made “in the midst of a dynamic exercise”. His motivation was obviously to re-position his vehicle to keep observation as a trainer. This does not justify the rash decision, but it provides the relevant context in which the wrongdoing occurred. In addition, there were two other factors which contributed to the causation in fact, i.e. the left steer and the failure of the intercom communication.

222    As regards the sentencing precedents, unlike the Commando dunking cases and the SCDF ragging cases where the water treatment and ragging respectively were prohibited acts, the decision to overtake was not in and of itself a prohibited act. In addition, unlike those cases where the acts were directed at others, the accused was also in the Land Rover and subjected to relatively the same risk. I noted in particular the post-2008 cases where the two offenders in the SCDF ragging case received 12 months’ (plead guilty) and 13 months’ (claim trial) imprisonment respectively. In my view, the four months’ distinction in sentence which the prosecution was seeking to make was insufficient to reflect the accused’s comparatively lower culpability.

223    As regards the fact that the accused did not admit that he gave the order to overtake in the course of investigations on his own accord, I did not accept the prosecution’s submission that I should regard it as an offender-specific aggravating factor. I instead took the position that the fact that the accused has claimed trial disentitled him from any sentencing discount which might have applied if he had pleaded guilty and if he had cooperated in the course of investigations.

224    Looking at the matter in the round, in my view a term of five months’ imprisonment was appropriate to reflect the accused’s culpability.
