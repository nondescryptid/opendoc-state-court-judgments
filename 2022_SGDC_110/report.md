Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Offence under Section 420 Penal Code – Cheating – Whether sentence of imprisonment is manifestly excessive

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9082/2022/01.\]

27 May 2022

### District Judge Kamala Ponnampalam:

1       This is an appeal against sentence by the accused person, Mr Woo Haw Ming (“the Accused”). On 18 April 2022, the Accused pleaded guilty to two charges for offences under section 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008). Two other similar charges were taken into consideration (“TIC”) for purposes of sentencing. The Accused was sentenced to _three_ months imprisonment for each of the two proceeded charges. The terms of imprisonment were ordered to run concurrently, making a total sentence of _three_ months imprisonment. The Accused’s sentence of imprisonment has been stayed pending the hearing of this appeal. He is presently released on bail pending appeal.

## Charges

2       The proceeded charges are reproduced below for ease of reference. The two TIC charges are broadly similar save for the differences in the particulars of the charges.

3       DAC 921660-2021:

> …you, are charged that you, on the 31st day of January 2019, did cheat Mvjestic Holdings Pte Ltd, UEN 201508543H (“the Landlord”), the owner of 214A Tanjong Katong Road Singapore 437007 (“the Unit”), to wit, by deceiving the Landlord into believing that you were the rightful party leasing the Unit, that one Lee Jwee Kang and one Ahmad Syukni bin Zaidi Agam would be tenants of the Unit, and that you would be observing all the covenants of the tenancy agreement dated 31 January 2019, facts which you knew to be false, and by such manner of deception, dishonestly induced the Landlord to make valuable security, to wit, by signing the tenancy agreement for the Unit, which the Landlord would not have done had the Landlord not been so deceived, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

4       DAC 910077-2021:

> …you, are charged that you, on the 4th day of December 2019, did cheat Mvjestic Holdings Pte Ltd, UEN 201508543H (“the Landlord”), the owner of 214A Tanjong Katong Road Singapore 437007 (“the Unit”), to wit, by deceiving the Landlord into believing that you were the rightful party leasing the Unit, that one Lee Jwee Kang and one Ahmad Syukni bin Zaidi Agam would be tenants of the Unit, and that you would be observing all the covenants of the tenancy agreement dated 4 December 2019, facts which you knew to be false, and by such manner of deception, dishonestly induced the Landlord to make valuable security, to wit, by signing the tenancy agreement for the Unit, which the Landlord would not have done had the Landlord not been so deceived, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

## Facts

5       The Accused is a male, Singapore citizen, aged 36 years. In October 2018, he received a phone call from one ‘Eric’ whom he had previously befriended in prison. The Accused told ‘Eric’ that he needed money, and ‘Eric’ replied that he knew a way in which the Accused could make easy money. The Accused simply had to use his name to sign tenancy agreements for KTV workers. The Accused agreed to the arrangement, and ‘Eric’ provided him with the details.

6       On 27 January 2019, acting under instructions from ‘Eric’, the Accused contacted the property agent representing the victim, Mvjestic Holdings Pte Ltd (“Mvjestic”). Mvjestic is the registered owner of a unit at 214A Tanjong Katong Road, Singapore. This property was listed as a unit for rental. It is also the subject matter of the two proceeded charges.

7       The Accused represented to the property agent that he wished to rent the unit for a year. He stated he would have two co-tenants and gave their names as Lee Jwee Kang and one Ahmad Syukni bin Zaidi Agam and provided their NRIC numbers. The Accused had obtained these details from ‘Eric’. On 28 January 2019 at about 7.30pm, the Accused viewed the unit with the property agent. He confirmed his interest in the property and offered a rental sum of SGD$3,200 a month.

8       On 31 January 2019, the Accused and Mvjestic entered into a tenancy agreement. Mvjestic agreed to lease the unit to the Accused for a period of 12 months from 31 January 2019 to 30 January 2020 for a monthly rental of SGD$3,200. The tenancy agreement was signed by the Accused, the property agent, and the director of Mvjestic, one Soh Hock Seng. The tenancy agreement included covenants at Clause 3(u) which required the named tenant to use the premises as a private dwelling house only, and not for any immoral, illegal or other purposes. At Clause 3(r) it was stipulated that the tenant was not to share, assign, sublet or part with the possession of unit without the prior written consent of Mvjestic. The Accused was at all times aware that neither he, nor the two persons whose names he had provided, would be residing in the unit. He had thus deceived Mvjestic with his representations and had induced Mvjestic into entering into a 12 month tenancy agreement with him and to part with possession of the unit, which Mvjestic would not have done had it not been so deceived.

9       After receiving the keys to the unit, the Accused, as instructed by ‘Eric’, left the keys and the documents on a table inside the unit and left the unit unlocked. He was paid $100 for his role in the signing of the tenancy agreement. Neither he nor Lee Jwee Kang or Ahmad Syukni bin Zaidi Agam resided in the unit at any point in time.

10     Sometime before 4 December 2019, ‘Eric’ instructed the Accused to renew the tenancy agreement for the unit. The Accused met with the property agent and signed a second tenancy agreement, to extend the lease for a further 12 months from 31 January 2020 to 30 January 2021 for a monthly rental of SGD$3,200. The Accused had once again perpetrated the same deception on Mvjestic to induce Mvjestic into signing the second tenancy agreement and to deliver the unit to him. The Accused was not paid by ‘Eric’ for the signing of the second tenancy agreement.

11     On 26 December 2019 at about 2.35pm, the police raided the unit and arrested three female subjects for offences under the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed). The three female subjects admitted to soliciting for clients online and providing sexual services for profit at the premises.

## Antecedents

12     The Accused was heavily traced for past offences. He admitted to the following convictions:

## Prosecution’s address on sentence

13     The Prosecution submitted for a term of four months imprisonment per charge with both terms of imprisonment to run concurrently, arriving at a global sentence of four months imprisonment. The Prosecution relied on the following arguments:

> (a)     The present case involves what is colloquially termed a “paper tenancy”, where the person who signs for the tenancy is not the actual tenant of the premises. In this case, the accused’s facilitation of a paper tenancy was part of a larger scheme to carry out vice-related activities on the premises.

> (b)     Paper tenancies, where innocent landlords are deceived into allowing their private residential properties to be used as brothels, are increasingly prevalent. The nominal tenants in these cases are often given some monies to sign a lease, assume the position of tenant, and secure the lease for the true tenant who will then use the property for vice activities.

> (c)     There were intentional efforts to frustrate government regulations which is an aggravating factor. The deception here was to circumvent law enforcement and to enable others to commit criminal offences, in this case vice activities on the premises. In so doing, they frustrate the purpose behind government regulation for having registered tenants who can then be held accountable for actions that take place within the premises. There was substantial frustration in this case of the regulation behind the registration of tenancies, and the regulation of activities that happen within the premises.

> (d)     While there may be little or no actual financial loss caused, as the rental fees are often paid on time, these offences are serious as they enable the layering of vice activities, such that the actual culprits behind the criminal or vice activities are hidden from detection. The lack of monetary loss is not a bar to the imposition of a significant custodial sentence if other factors such as public policy considerations are relevant.

> (e)     Such offences are difficult to detect. In the present case, were it not for the police raids on the residential units, the Accused’s offences would have remained undetected allowing the Accused to continue to perpetrate his deception on other landlords.

> (f)     There is strong public interest in imposing deterrent sentences to prevent criminal or vice activities from proliferating in Singapore and undermining public order and decency.

> (g)     The Accused’s culpability in the present case is significant. While the Accused was not the originator of the scam, the circumstances in which he was approached to carry out the scam, as well as his knowledge, as admitted in the SOF, that the unit would be used by KTV workers would be strong evidence that he knew the potential activities that would take place within the premises, and that his signing of the paper tenancy would help to facilitate those activities, especially given the highly suspicious way in which he was instructed to leave the keys and the documents in the unit and just walk out of the door without locking it. Even if the accused did not have specific knowledge of the exact nature of the vice activities taking place on the premises, the circumstances of the transaction would have definitely made him aware that there is some intent to circumvent the regulations, since the name on the paper tenancy clearly did not match the person living there. Where deception and cheating is used to enable others to carry out further criminal offences, these should form part of the assessment of the severity of the offence.

> (h)     The Accused signed multiple tenancy agreements relating to at least three different properties, which are the subject matter of the charges taken into consideration.

> (i)     The accused is traced for multiple offences from 2008 to 2018.

14     The Prosecution stated that there are no reported precedents on paper tenancies and instead relied on three reported decisions that concern similar factual patterns where no direct monetary loss was suffered in respect of charges under section 420 of the Penal Code.

15     In _PP v Mikhy K Ferrera Brochez__[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)_, the accused was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment in respect of one charge of cheating under section 420 of the Penal Code. He had conspired with a doctor to submit a falsified blood test result to fraudulently induce MOM to deliver an Employment Pass to him. Through the deceit, the accused obtained the right to live and work in Singapore. The Court found that the accused had entered into a “highly premeditative scheme to perpetrate a serious deception on MOM” and accordingly, the dominant sentencing consideration was general deterrence.

16     In _Dong Guitian v PP__[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2)_, the accused was convicted of two counts of cheating under section 420 of the Penal Code. He submitted false Prior Approval applications to MOM to obtain a quota for foreign construction workers. He then profited by charging the workers commission for bringing them into Singapore. The accused was sentenced to 6 months imprisonment on each charge. CJ Yong Pung How noted that “_it was true that MOM had not suffered any immediate and tangible financial loss. However, there was no denying that the appellant’s act of deception had frustrated the intention of the Singapore Government to effectively regulate and monitor the recruitment of foreign labour in Singapore_.”[^3] CJ Yong affirmed that deterrence should be the dominant sentencing consideration in that case.

17     In _PP v Tan Wen Jie__[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4)_, the accused repurposed vehicles that had been slated for deregistration and scrapping and recycled these vehicles onto the roads through falsified Bills of Lading and Cargo Clearance documents to give the false impression that the cars had been sent overseas for re-export. The recycled vehicles were ultimately used for the commission of various criminal offences. The accused faced three charges under section 420 of the Penal Code. The District Judge accepted the Prosecution’s submission that “_They (had) caused severe harm through their scheme – apart from causing significant financial losses to the LTA and circumventing LTA’s regulatory controls on the vehicle population, they had also perpetrated a subversion of public order by enabling others to commit further criminal offences_”.[^5] The accused received sentences of between 11 and 15 months’ imprisonment for each charge under section 420 of the Penal Code.

18     The Prosecution reiterated that the specific act of a paper tenancy to facilitate vice activity is becoming prevalent, and there is a strong public interest in imposing a deterrent sentence. The lack of direct monetary loss caused to the victim is not a bar to the imposition of a longer custodial sentence. The Accused not being paid for the renewal of the tenancy in respect of the same property, is not a mitigating fact but a neutral factor at best.

## Mitigation and Defence’s Submissions on Sentence

19     The Defence Counsel set out the Accused’s personal circumstances in the Mitigation plea. He pleaded for a short custodial sentence of _six_ weeks imprisonment for each charge, with the sentences to run concurrently. He stated that there were no reported decisions for similar type of offences and relied on five newspaper articles carrying reports of seemingly similar cases involving paper tenancies. The following facts were pleaded in mitigation.

20     The Accused is married and has a young child aged two years and nine months. He resides with his family in a room within an office premise. He is employed as a car valet service operator and is the sole breadwinner for his family. He has pleaded guilty at the first instance as he knows that he has committed a wrong and apologizes for his conduct. He has cooperated with the police during investigations by readily admitting to his offences when he was interviewed by the police. He gave a positive statement to the police. Although the Accused has a string of antecedents, he has no prior cheating offences.

21     The Accused is remorseful and regrets his actions. He committed the offences at a time when he was in dire financial need. They were committed shortly after his release from prison in late 2018 when his wife was pregnant with his daughter and he was concerned for his wife, who is an Indonesian national. He was looking for work and he got in touch with ‘Eric’, who told him that if he could sign these tenancy agreements, he will get some monetary reward. He was told that they were for KTV workers, whom he thought would ordinarily have some form of employment status. He did not know that the premises would be used for vice-related activities.

22     The Accused executed three tenancy agreements, all within the month of January 2019 and he renewed one tenancy agreement in December 2019. He received a total of $300/- for the three tenancy agreements that were executed in January 2019. He did not receive any monies for the renewal of the tenancy agreement in December 2019

23     The Accused has remained crime-free since January 2019 and has not committed any other offence except for the renewal of the one tenancy agreement, for which he did not receive any monies. He is working hard to remain crime free, and to be a good father to his young daughter.

24     The Defence argued that there was no loss caused to anyone as a result of these offences. In fact, the landlords may have gained from the deposit monies forfeited, pursuant to a breach in the term of the Tenancy Agreement.

25     The Defence submitted that there are no reported cases on LawNet pertaining to ‘cheating’ of landlords by making false representations. Consequently, the Defence had to rely on unreported cases for similar type of cases to obtain an indication of the sentencing norms. The Defence argued that the Courts are discouraged from relying on unreported cases only in instances when reported decisions are available. In this instance, where both the Prosecution and the Defence agree that there are no reported cases, then the unreported cases offer some guidance, and the PG papers will give some semblance of where the benchmark sentences, or the indicative sentences should reside, and that is informative and helpful to the Court. The Defence added that they have no access to the PG papers and have done their best to cite precedents within the constraints of their limited access to information.

26     The Defence tendered a table of sentencing precedents (reproduced below). It was highlighted that the sentence imposed varied depending on (a) the number of charges; (b) the amount involved; and (c) whether the accused had knowledge that the apartments would be used for vice-related activities.

27     The Defence argued that the Accused’s case is most similar to _Lin Fengchun’s_ case. In that case, the accused faced three charges for three tenancy agreements and the Prosecution proceeded on one charge. The facts are similar. _Lin Fengchun_ was in need of money when he came across an online advertisement stating that he would get paid by signing a tenancy agreement on someone else’s behalf. After executing the agreement, _Lin Fengchun_ left the document on the table and walked out of the apartment. _Lin Fengchun_ was unaware that the apartment would be used for vice-related activities. _Lin Fengchun_ was paid RMB2,000, equivalent to SGD$410. (The Accused here received only a total of $300). The Court imposed a sentence of _four_ weeks imprisonment and fine of $400/-. The Defence stated that it has submitted for a slightly higher tariff of _six_ weeks imprisonment per charge in this case, taking into account the Accused’s antecedents, the two TIC charges and the fact that he helped ‘Eric’ to renew one tenancy agreement in December 2019.

28     When it was pointed out that _Lin Fengchun_ faced a lesser charge under section 417 of the Penal Code, thus attracting a lower penalty, the Defence responded that the higher sentence of _six_ weeks imprisonment sought for in this case is proportionate and appropriate in all the circumstances of this case.

29     The Defence further submitted that the additional cases cited involved longer sentences as the accused persons in those cases knew that the premises would be used for vice activities or had syndicate associations. These are key distinguishing factors. The Accused here he did not know that his signing of a paper tenancy would help facilitate vice-related activities at the rented properties. He was not the mastermind of the scam or complicit with any syndicate.

30     The Defence distinguished the cases cited by the Prosecution arguing that they pertained to MOM employment passes and LTA regulations, which are not the same as the instant case.

## Decision on sentence

31     The prescribed punishment for offences under section 420 of the Penal Code is _mandatory_ imprisonment for up to 10 years, and be liable to a fine as well. As a term of imprisonment is mandated, the central question in this case is the length of imprisonment to be imposed, and a fine if any.

### Sentencing Approach

32     Parties submitted that there are no reported decisions for a similar factual matrix involving paper tenancies. In the absence of useful sentencing precedents, I took guidance from the High Court decision in _Logachev Vladislav v PP__[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6)_ ("_Logachev_") and approached this case on first principles. The offence-specific and offender-specific factors were first identified and itemised. The offence-specific factors are those which relate to the manner and mode in which the offence was committed as well as the harm caused to the victim. The offender-specific factors are the aggravating and mitigating factors which were personal to the offender and which relate to the offender’s particular personal circumstances.[^7]

33     The table from _Logachev’s_ case[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8) illustrating this categorisation was particularly instructive. I reproduce below a modified version of the table to demonstrate the specific factors which were considered or disregarded in this case.

### Offence-specific factors

34     The offence-specific factors were first scrutinised to determine the level of harm caused in this case. I record below the weight accorded to each of these factors.

#### Factors going towards harm

##### (a)   Frustration of government regulations

35     It was submitted by the Prosecution that the sole intent of the paper tenancy was to circumvent the regulatory framework set up to police the type of activities that go on at private residences behind closed doors. The registered tenant, who does not occupy the premises, becomes the decoy for the actual culprits who are often found running vice-related activities at the premises. The layering afforded by the paper tenancy shields the operator and his operations from discovery. There is substantial frustration of government regulations. The Defence did not counter this argument.

36     The facts of this case bore out the Prosecution’s arguments. Indeed the premises rented by the Accused person under false pretenses were used for vice-related activities. I was persuaded that such an elaborate scheme to outwit the authorities, merited a robust sentence capable of deterring others who may be similarly lured by the promise of easy money to assist in such operations.

##### (b)   Public policy considerations

37     The regulatory framework governing tenancies is integral to maintaining public order and decency in our community. The proliferation of vice-related activities is both undesirable and detrimental to our social fabric. I agreed with the Prosecution that public policy considerations demand that offences which undermine the government’s efforts to keep our neighbourhoods clean and free of vice-related activities must be met with a deterrent sentence.

##### (c)   An elaborate operation to facilitate vice-related activities

38     Three women were arrested during a police raid at the premises. Police investigations revealed that they had used the premises to provide sexual services. ‘Eric’ who had instructed the Accused to enter into the paper tenancies for a total of three properties, has not been apprehended. It is evident even from the brief facts before this Court that there was a sophisticated operation behind the Accused’s offences. Suitable properties were identified and the Accused was activated to enter into sham tenancies. The tenancies were monitored and renewed before they fell due. Women were recruited to run the vice operations. The person or persons behind this elaborate operation remain at large. Without doubt, this was a well-orchestrated operation that would have continued but for the police raid. This is yet another factor that pushes this case towards the higher end of the severity spectrum.

##### (d)   Difficulty in detection

39     The difficulty in detection here has to do not only with the detection of the offences but also with the detection of the originators or the masterminds behind the offences. The rentals were paid on time and the landlords had no cause for complaint. The Prosecution pointed out that the offences would have likely not come to light if not for the raid on the premises. The originators of the scheme remain hidden behind the sham tenancies and to date are not identified. The difficulty in detection means that the vice-related offences can proliferate with ease. I agreed with the Prosecution that a more severe sentence is needed to discourage potential offenders.

##### (e)   Prevalence of paper tenancy offences

40     The Prosecution submitted that paper tenancies are becoming increasingly prevalent although the arguments were not supported with statistics on recent crime trends. Notably, the Defence did not challenge this submission. In fact, the Defence’s sentencing table cited several recent newspaper reports which appear to lend support to the Prosecution’s submission. I accepted the Prosecution’s submission at face value and agreed that this is yet another factor to favour general deterrence.

#### Factors going towards culpability

41     I turn now to assess the Accused’s level of culpability in committing these offences.

##### (a)   The Accused was aware of the illicit nature of the paper tenancies

42     The Prosecution made firm submissions with regards to the Accused’s knowledge or awareness of the illicit purpose behind the paper tenancies. They argued that the tenancy agreements were made under highly suspicious circumstances which would have alerted him to the nature of activities planned at the premises. The Defence strenuously countered that the Accused did not know that the premises would be used for vice-related activities.

43     After considering the facts, I could not but agree with the Prosecution that the Accused must have been alerted that something illicit was planned. I relied on the following facts to arrive at this conclusion.

> ·    The tenancy agreements executed by him were highly irregular.

> ·    The Accused was asked by one ‘Eric’ whom he had met in prison to sign the tenancy agreements;

> ·    No reason was given for why ‘Eric’ could not sign the agreements himself;

> ·    The Accused was paid for signing the tenancy agreements;

> ·    The Accused did not reside in the unit but he was listed as an occupier in the tenancy agreement;

> ·    Most curiously, the Accused was told to leave the keys and the tenancy agreement in the unit and leave the unit unlocked.

44     All these facts taken together must have raised alarm bells, and even if the Accused did not know the exact nature of the illicit activity planned, the covert nature in which the tenancy agreements were secured and handed over, should have alerted him to the fact that the unit would likely be used for an illegal activity. If the Accused had chosen not to enquire further, then he had willfully turned a blind eye, and it lies ill in his mouth to assert that he was unaware of the nature of the activities that were to take place at the rented unit. I found that he had some awareness that the unit would be used for illegal activities and to that extent, he was complicit in the vice-related activities that went on in the unit. This fact alone elevated his level of culpability significantly.

##### (b)   Multiple properties involved

45     There was a total of three properties involved owned by three different victims, and the renewal of one tenancy lease. This was not a one-off participation in a sham tenancy.

##### (c)   The duration of offending

46     The three tenancy agreements were executed in January 2019 and the renewal of one tenancy agreement was made in December 2019. I accepted that the initial period of offending was brief, but I also note that the offending behaviour persisted when the opportunity presented itself some eleven months later.

##### (d)   The offender’s role

47     The Accused acted on the instructions of ‘Eric’ and was an integral part of the larger plan to use the premises for vice-related activities. His cheating offences were an important catalyst for the vice-related offences, and while the vice-related offences are not before this Court, they cannot be ignored as they are indicative of the overall harm flowing from the Accused’s offences. In this regard, the Accused’s level of culpability was not insignificant.

### Offender-specific factors

48     In the next step of the analysis, I examined the aggravating and mitigating factors which would determine if the presumptive sentence arrived at after considering the offence-specific factors ought to be calibrated further.

#### Aggravating factors

49     There were no aggravating factors of significance save for the two general factors discussed below.

##### (a)   Offences taken into consideration (“TIC”) for sentencing purposes

50     There were two TIC charges which the Accused admitted to and consented to be taken into consideration for sentencing purposes. The two TIC charges involved two more sham tenancy agreements for two separate properties owned by different owners. In general, the effect of the inclusion of TIC charges would be that the sentence which the court would have otherwise imposed for the proceeded charge, would be increased. In this case, the TIC charges were for offences of a similar nature, and I saw no reason to depart from this general rule.

##### (b)   Relevant antecedents

51     The Defence argued that the Accused has no antecedents for cheating, and this is the first instance that he has been charged for such an offence. I accepted this argument. I noted however that this was not his first brush with the law, and that he has been committing offences on numerous occasions in the past. The fact that he is now charged with a different species of offences is a neutral factor at best.

#### Mitigating factors

52     The mitigating factors which were considered in sentencing are as follows.

##### (a)   A guilty plea

53     I accepted that the Accused has entered a guilty plea at the first opportunity and _saved the criminal justice system resources that would have been expended with a full trial_.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9) I also accept that _it was motivated by genuine remorse (and) contrition_ which was demonstrated by his positive statements to the police.

##### (b)   Co-operation with the authorities

54     It was submitted by the Defence, and not disputed by the Prosecution, that the Accused had co-operated with the authorities during investigations. The extent of his co-operation beyond his confessions was not highlighted, but nonetheless I gave this factor its due mitigating weight.

### Calibrating the appropriate sentence

55     At the end of the preceding exercise, where I examined the offence-specific and the offender-specific factors, I arrived at the following conclusions. The level of harm caused was at the higher end of the low band, and the Accused’s level of culpability, which was not insignificant, was similarly at the higher end of the low band. This low-harm-low-culpability whilst still residing in the low band, was pegged at the higher end of the band.

### Case precedents cited

56     I turn now to examine the case precedents cited to assess their relevance to the current facts.

57     The Prosecution cited three cases involving cheating offences under section 420 of the Penal Code. It was submitted that their relevance lay in the fact that they involved deceptions aimed at circumventing government regulations. It was further argued that while there was no financial loss caused to the victims, there was significant harm occasioned by subverting the proper operation of the government’s regulations, and this form of harm warranted a deterrent sentence. The cases were also cited for their precedent value for indications on sentence. The following is a brief recap of the sentences imposed.

> ·    In _PP v Mikhy K Ferrera Brochez_, the accused pleaded guilty to one charge under section 420 of the Penal Code and five other dissimilar charges and admitted and consented to 17 TIC charges, none of which were for cheating offences. He was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment for the cheating charge. The appeal against sentence was dismissed.

> ·    In _Dong Guitian v PP_, the accused claimed trial to two charges of cheating under section 420 of the Penal Code. There were no TIC charges. He was sentenced to six months imprisonment for each charge with both sentences to run concurrently. The conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal.

> ·    In _PP v Tan Wen Jie_, the accused pleaded guilty to three charges under section 420 of the Penal Code and three other dissimilar charges and admitted and consented to nine TIC charges of which five were for cheating offences. He was sentenced to 11, 12 and 15 months imprisonment for the three proceeded cheating charges. The appeal against sentence was dismissed.

58     I found that two of the three cases cited by the Prosecution were relevant and helpful in calibrating sentences. These are _PP v Mikhy K Ferrera Brochez_ and _Dong Guitian v PP_. Typically, in offences under section 420 of the Penal Code, the predominant factor in assessing the harm caused is the amount of financial loss suffered by the victim. The particular conundrum with the facts in the present case is that the harm caused is patently evident but not easily quantifiable in the conventional sense. The two cases cited are useful guides for fixing a value to the intangible offence-specific factor which is the frustration of government policy and regulations. The sentences meted out in those cases provide important indicators for arriving at a starting sentence in this case.

59     I found that the case of _PP v Tan Wen Jie_ involved a different factual matrix and is of limited relevance to the present case. There was financial loss caused to two government agencies, LTA and Customs, amounting to $131,089. The sentencing considerations there were slightly different from those in the present case.

60     I turn now to consider the sentencing precedents cited by the Defence.

61     The Defence relied on five cases which had been reported in the press and tendered the newspaper articles in support of their submissions. They argued that the facts were similar to the present case, and in the absence of reported decisions, the newspaper reports provided a good indication of the sentencing norm for such cases. I found this reliance on newspaper reports to be unsatisfactory on several levels.

62     The Courts now eschew reliance on unreported cases _as they carry little if any precedential value because they are unreasoned_.[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10) In some instances, when there is a dearth of relevant sentencing precedents such as the present case, the Courts do use unreported decisions as useful reference points in the sentencing analysis. But they always approach such cases with caution, since the unreported cases offer little insight into the reasoning behind the sentences imposed.

63     This problem is compounded when the source of the unreported decision is a newspaper article. Newspaper reports are often brief and may omit important details such as the offence provision, the total number of charges involved and the number proceeded with, the individual sentence for each charge, and specifics like the offender’s antecedents and the mitigation pleaded. These gaps in the information can lead to erroneous conclusions as was seen in the instant case.

64     The Defence relied on the case for the offender _Lin Fengchun_ (s/n 1 in the Defence’s list of Sentencing Precedents) but it was discovered in the course of submissions that the accused in that case faced a lesser charge under section 417 of the Penal Code. The punishment under section 417 of the Penal Code is for a term imprisonment which may extend to _three_ years, or a fine, or both. Imprisonment is not mandated and there is the option of sentencing with a fine only. Section 420 of the Penal Code on the other hand, mandates imprisonment for up to 10 years, more than three times the term prescribed for the lesser charge. The sentencing considerations for the two offences are wholly different. I was of the view that it would be inappropriate to rely on the sentence imposed for a lesser charge as it could lead to incongruous outcomes.

65     For the same reasons, I dismissed the report on the offender _Beh Dien_ (s/n 5 in the Defence’s list of Sentencing Precedents) for living on the earnings of prostitutes and renting out her property knowing it would be used as a brothel. These appeared to be offences under the Women’s Charter.

66     The remaining three newspaper reports appear to be for charges under section 420 of the Penal Code but I found them unhelpful as the facts and circumstances were not reported in sufficient detail to enable meaningful comparisons to be made.

67     The offender _Jiang Hualei_ (s/n 4 in the Defence’s list of Sentencing Precedents) was sentenced to 12 weeks imprisonment for one count of cheating under what appears to be from the article, an offence under s 420 of the Penal Code. The report was brief and stated that the offender had entered into the lease agreement on behalf of a vice syndicate. It did not elaborate if the offender was aware of this fact. The lack of pertinent details made it unsafe to rely on this report.

68     The offender _Bernard Que Doh Bing_ (s/n 3 in the Defence’s list of Sentencing Precedents) pleaded guilty to five charges for cheating and was sentenced to 45 weeks imprisonment and fined $10,750. Seven other charges were TIC. The proceeded charges appear to be under section 420 of the Penal Code. The offender was initially told that the properties were for foreign students or workers, but later discovered that they were used for prostitution. He continued to enter into the lease agreements even after he became aware. The newspaper report gave details of the ruse perpetrated by the offender but no further details which would assist in sentencing; details such as the individual sentence imposed for each charge, criminal antecedents and particulars of the TIC charges. The absence of such details rendered this report unhelpful in sentencing.

69     The offender _Sheng Qing_ (s/n 2 in the Defence’s list of Sentencing Precedents) pleaded guilty to 16 charges of cheating under what appears to be offences under section 420 of the Penal Code, and five counts of allowing the properties to be used as a brothel which seem to be offences under the Women’s Charter. He was sentenced to a total of 20 months imprisonment and fined $15,000. A further 17 similar charged were TIC. The offender here was told that the properties would be used to house prostitutes who would provide sexual services at the premises. The offender was initially arrested for the first set of charges but committed the same offences when he was released on bail. The brief report did not specify the individual sentences and did not distinguish between the sentence imposed for the cheating offences and the Women’s Charter offences. The mere reporting of the total sentence was unhelpful in deriving the sentencing range in the present case.

70     The Defence strenuously argued that the Prosecution ought to produce the PG documents for the cases cited by them as the Prosecution had access to ICMS, the e-filing system for criminal cases. The Defence’s position was that the PG papers would provide useful guidance to the Court. I disagreed and declined to direct the Prosecution to tender such documents. It is my firm belief that in the absence of written grounds setting out the reasons for the sentence imposed the _unreported cases have limited precedential value_.

### The sentence imposed

71     At this juncture, the earlier harm-culpability assessment was reviewed and bearing in mind that the Court ought to utilise the full range of the penalty prescribed, I determined that in a case of low-harm-low-culpability, a sentence of up to _six_ months imprisonment would be appropriate. This indicative sentence is also in line with the two precedents cited by the Prosecution. The next step was to examine the aggravating and mitigating factors to determine if the presumptive sentence of up to _six_ months imprisonment ought to be calibrated further.

72     As I have noted in past cases,[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11) an important factor to consider is the Accused’s prior offending history. It reveals whether he was generally law-abiding or one who required a firm reprimand to forestall further offending. The Accused in this case has several antecedents for serious offences albeit none for an offence of cheating. He is not charged for any further offences after the present set of offences were uncovered in December 2019. In my assessment, these facts placed him well away from the lower end of the sentencing range but not beyond the mid-point in the range, at about three to four months imprisonment.

73     I next examined the effect of the TIC charges. The Accused faces two TIC charges in addition to the two proceeded charges. The TIC charges are similar to the proceeded charges and in a sense, a continuum of the proceeded charges. The instructions for these two offences came from the same originator, ‘Eric’, and were committed in the same fashion at about the same time. I concluded that the TIC charges warranted an uplift in the sentence that would have otherwise been imposed. This determination edged the sentence further along the range to about four to five months imprisonment.

74     In the Accused’s favour, I noted that he had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and co-operated with the police during investigations. He received a meagre sum of $300 for his role in these offences and the period of offending was not long. There was no further egregious behaviour involved beyond the commission of the offences _per se_. I concluded that these mitigating factors were significant and must be accorded their full weight.

75     In the final assessment, after making the appropriate adjustments to give due weight to the aggravating and mitigating factors, I determined that a sentence of three months imprisonment per charge would be just and appropriate. The two proceeded charges arose from the same set of facts and I did not find it necessary to order the sentences to run consecutively. They were allowed to run concurrently making a total sentence of _three_ months imprisonment.

## Conclusion

76     The total sentence of three months imprisonment on the facts of this case is not manifestly excessive.
