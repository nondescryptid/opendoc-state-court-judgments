### District Judge Adam Nakhoda:

## Introduction

1       The Accused having been afforded the opportunity to rehabilitate and reintegrate into society under the aegis of the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme (MAS), squandered that opportunity when he failed to present himself for mandatory urine tests and then when he committed a committed serious breach of the mandatory aftercare conditions (MAC) that he was subject to under the MAS.

2       The Accused pleaded guilty an offence under Regulation 15(3)(f) read with Reg 15(6)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions, Medical Observation and Treatment and Rehabilitation Regulations) (the Regulations) (the FPUT offence) and an offence under s 50Y(1)(a) of the Prisons Act (the PA). As the commission of the FPUT offence was committed whilst the Accused was still subject to a remission order and this amounted to a breach of the basic condition of the remission order the Accused was liable to be punished with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment under s 50T(1)(a) of the PA.

3       For the FPUT offence, I sentenced the Accused to an enhanced sentence of imprisonment of 285 days’ and nine months’ imprisonment, and for the s 50Y(1)(a) offence I sentenced the Accused to 22 days’ imprisonment. I ordered that all the sentences were to run consecutively. The Accused being dissatisfied with the sentence has appealed. He is currently serving sentence.

## Charges

4       The charges are as:

> **1st charge**

> You, Abdul Mutalib bin Aziman, are charged that you, on 10 February 2020, in Singapore, being a person subject to a Supervision Order for a period of 24 months with effect from 14 September 2019, issued under Reg 15(2) of Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (Rg 3, 1999 Rev Ed), did fail to present yourself for urine test to the Duty Officer at Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters as required under the said Order, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Regulation 15(3)(_f_) read with Regulation 15(6)(_a_) of the said Regulations.

> And further, that you, from 14 September 2019 to 11 July 2021, were subject to a remission order made by the Commissioner of Prisons under Division 2 or 3 of Part VB of the Prisons Act (Chapter 247, Rev. Ed. 2014) which remission order is subject to the basic condition under Section 50S(1) of the Prisons Act and while the remission order is in effect you, on 10 February 2020, committed the aforesaid offence and upon conviction and the imposition of a sentence reflected under Section 50S(1)(b) of the Prisons Act, shall be deemed to have breached the basic condition of your remission order, and you are thereby liable to be punished under Section 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of **518 days** from 10 February 2020 to 11 July 2021 for that offence.

> **2nd charge**

> You, Abdul Mutalib bin Aziman, are charged that you, on **30 Mar 2020**, in Singapore, while being subjected to a remission order from **14 Sep 2019** to **11 Jul 2021** (both dates inclusive), made by the Commissioner of Prisons under Division 2 of Part VB of the Prisons Act (Cap. 247, 2000 Rev. Ed.), which remission order is subject to mandatory aftercare conditions under section 50V(3) of the said Act, did commit a serious breach of a mandatory aftercare condition of your remission order under regulation 151H(1)(a) of the Prisons Regulations (Cap. 247, Rg. 2), to wit, by failing to remain indoors at your place of residence at such time as specified in your remission order in accordance with section 50V(3)(c) of the said Act, for a cumulative period of 24 hours, whereby you have breached curfew between **28 Mar 2020** and **30 Mar 2020** for a total of **32 hours 41 minutes**, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 50Y(1)(a) of the said Act.

> You shall therefore be liable to be punished with a sentence of imprisonment not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of **469** days from **30 Mar 2020** to **11 Jul 2021** for that offence.

## Facts

5       The Accused is Abdul Mutalib Bin Aziman, a 27-year-old male Singaporean. On 5 April 2016, a District Court sentenced the Accused to five and a half years imprisonment with three strokes of the cane for an offence of consumption of methamphetamine (LT1) and three FPUT offences. On 14 September 2019, the Accused was released from prison and was subjected to a remission order under s 50I of the PA from 14 September 2019 to 11 July 2021. The remission order was subject to the basic condition under s 50S(1).

6       Upon his release, the Accused was also placed on compulsory supervision under Reg 15 of the Regulations. The supervision order required the Accused to present himself for urine tests at Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters every Monday and Thursday from 14 September 2019 to 13 September 2021. The Accused failed to present himself for a urine test on 10 February 2020. In fact, the Accused failed to present himself for urine tests, without valid reasons, on nine occasions between 13 January 2020 and 10 February 2020.

7       The Accused’s failure to present himself for a urine test on 10 February was an offence under Reg 15(3)(f) read with Reg 15(6)(a) of the Regulations and it amounted, under s 50S(1)(a) of the PA, to a breach of the basic condition of the remission order. Therefore, the Accused was liable to an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for the remaining duration of the remission order, which was 518 days.

8       Concurrently, the Accused was placed on the MAS from 14 September 2019 to 13 March 2021 and was required to comply with the MAC which included, _inter alia_, the following conditions:

> A.1    You must, unless admitted to hospital, reside in a halfway house at 1825 Upper Changi Road North, Singapore 506780, for the period as required by the Commissioner of Prisons.

> …

> B.1    You must remain indoors between 2200 hours and 0600 hours every day of the week at the halfway house or specified place or your place of residence the day of the week and timing of which may be adjusted from time to time by your supervision officer(s) or by the Manager of the halfway house as the case may be.

9       Paragraph 12(a) of the remission order stated that a failure to remain indoors for a cumulative period of 24 hours would amount to a serious breach of an MAC and paragraph 13 stated that the commission of a serious breach of an MAC was an offence. A serious breach was punishable with an imprisonment term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order at the date when the Accused committed the serious breach.

10     The Accused had been granted approved time-off that expired on 28 March 2020 at 10.00 p.m. However, the Accused failed to return to the halfway house after the expiry of his approved time-off. At 11.38 p.m., the duty officer called the Accused to remind him that his time-off had expired. The Accused answered the call and said that he had informed his programme executive (PE) that he was requesting an extension to his time-off. The Accused claimed that he needed to attend to an urgent family matter.

11     On 29 March at 12.16 p.m., the Accused forwarded a screenshot of his conversation with the PE to the duty officer, but it was clear that the PE had not approved the Accused’s request as the Accused had not provided any verification of the family matter that he had to attend to. On 29 March at 11.08 p.m. the Accused’s request for extended time-off was rejected as he had failed to provide sufficient justification. At 11.18 p.m., the duty officer attempted to call the Accused to inform him of the rejection. The Accused did not answer the call. The duty officer then sent text messages to the Accused informing him that he did not have any more approved time-off and that he had to update his location and return to the halfway house immediately. On 30 March 2020 at 12.30 a.m., the Accused sent a text message stating that he was attending to family matters.

12     The Accused returned to the halfway house on 30 March 2011 at 11.11 p.m.. The Accused had failed to remain indoors between 10.00 p.m. on 28 March and 11.11 p.m. on 30 March, and excluding periods when the Accused had approved time off, the Accused had failed to remain indoors for a cumulative period of 32 hours and 41 minutes. Subsequently, the Accused was arrested for committing a serious breach of an MAC. The Accused did not have a valid reason for not returning to the halfway house and he was aware that he had breached an MAC. The remaining duration of his remission order as at 30 March 2020 was 469 days.

## Charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing

13     The Accused admitted to and consented for another two charges under Reg 15(3)(f) read with Reg 15(6)(a) being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.

## Issues to be determined

14     The issues to be determined were:

> (a)     Whether the principle of escalation of the sentence for the FPUT offence was appropriate in view of the Accused’s antecedents;

> (b)     The principles applicable when sentencing an Accused to an enhanced sentence of imprisonment under s 50T(1)(a) of the PA; and

> (c)     The principles applicable when sentencing an Accused for an offence under s 50Y(1)(a) of the PA.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed Penalties

15     The FPUT offence is punishable with a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding four years or to both.

16     The maximum enhanced sentence of imprisonment that the Accused could be sentenced to under section 50T(1)(a) was the remaining duration of the remission order at the date of the commission of the Reg 15(3)(f) read with Reg 15(6)(a) offence, which was 518 days imprisonment.

17     The maximum sentence of imprisonment that the Accused could be sentenced for the section 50Y(1)(a) offence was the remaining duration of the remission order at the time the Accused committed the serious breach of an MAC, which was 469 days.

19     In addition, the Accused was placed on 24 months’ drug supervision on 8 November 2013 and 22 May 2015; and was admitted to the Drug Rehabilitation Centre on 10 February 2014.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

20     With regard to the FPUT offence, in light of the Accused’s antecedents, the Prosecution sought a sentence of ten months’ imprisonment.

21     For the s 50T(1)(a) of the PA component of the sentence, the Prosecution sought an enhanced sentence of imprisonment of 302 days. In support of the submission, the Prosecution, briefly, referred to the factors listed in s 50T(3)(a) to (d). With regard to the gravity of the offence[^1], the Prosecution submitted that an offence of failing to present for a urine test was of “moderate severity”. The Prosecution submitted that the current offence was “highly similar” to the offences that the Accused was under the remission order for[^2].

22     With regard to the factor under s 50T(3)(d), the Prosecution submitted that the Accused had committed the FPUT offence within four months of being released on the remission order. The Prosecution submitted that the length of time that the Accused had not committed any offence after his release was relatively short.

23     With regard to the factor under s 50T(3)(d), the Prosecution submitted that credit should be given to the Accused as he had pleaded guilty and as he had been gainfully employed after his release. The Prosecution submitted that having considered the factors the Accused’s breach was on the high side of moderately severe.

24     For the offence under s 50Y(1)(a) of the PA, the Prosecution sought a sentence of 22 days’ imprisonment. The Prosecution tendered written submissions applying the facts of the Accused’s breach to the factors at s 50Y(2)(a) to (d). With regard to the factor under s 50Y(2)(a), the Prosecution submitted that the Accused’s culpability was low as he had breached his curfew for only 32 hours and 41 minutes.

25     With regard to the factor under s 50Y(2)(b), the Prosecution submitted that the Accused’s culpability was low as he had committed the breach more than four months after he was placed on the MAS. For the factor under s 50Y(2)(c), the Prosecution submitted that the Accused’s culpability was similarly low as he had reported back to the halfway house himself, i.e. he was not arrested, and during his time on the MAS he was gainfully employed. Finally, with regard to the factor under s 50Y(2)(d), there were no aggravating factors and it was a mitigating factor that the Accused had pleaded guilty. The Prosecution submitted that the Accused’s overall culpability was low.

### Mitigation

26     The Accused expressed remorse for the offences and asked for leniency. He said that he had younger siblings and he needed to work to support his family.

### Precedents

27     Neither the Prosecution nor the Accused relied on any sentencing precedents.

### Decision on Sentence

#### Relevant legislative provisions

28     The relevant legislative provisions are as follows:

> (a)     Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions, Medical Observation and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations:

>> **15.** —(3)    A person in respect of whom a supervision order has been made under paragraph (2) or section 34(2)(a) of the Act shall, during the period he is subject to supervision, observe the following requirements:

>>> (f)    present himself at such times and places to provide a specimen of his urine for urine test, or speciments of his hair for a hair test, or both, as may be required by the supervision officer;

>> …

>> (6)    Without prejudice to the continuance of any supervision order in force against him, any person subject to such an order who contravenes or fails to comply with –

>>> (a)    Paragraph 3(a) or (f) or a requirement imposed on him under paragraph 5(a), (b), (c), (d) or (g) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 4 years or to both,

>>> (b)    Prisons Act:

>> **50S.** – (1)    It is the basic condition of every remission order made under Division 2 or 3 that the person released under the remission order –

>>> (a)    shall not commit any offence (not including an offence under section 50Y(1)) while the remission order is in effect; and

>>> (b)    shall not be convicted of that offence and sentence to any of the following:

>>>> (i)    a sentence of imprisonment (not including a default sentence);

>>>> (ii)   corrective training;

>>>> (iii)   reformative training;

>>>> (iv)   preventive detention.

>> (2)    Where a person commits an offence in breach of the basic condition of his remission order, he shall be deemed to have breached the basic condition on the date of the commission of the offence.

>> **50T.** – (1)    When a person commits an offence in breach of the basic condition of his remission order made under Division 2 or 3, the court may, in addition to imposing any sentence on the person for that offence, impose an enhanced sentence for that offence as follows:

>>> (a)    imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order, as determined based on the date of the commission of the offence;

>>> …

>> (3)    In deciding whether to impose any enhanced sentence under subsection (1) or (2) with respect to any offence, and if so the length of the enhanced sentence, the court shall consider –

>>> (a)    the gravity of the offence;

>>> (b)    whether the offence is of a similar nature to the offence for which the person under a remission order was originally sentenced;

>>> (c)    the length of time for which the person did not commit any offence after being released under that remission order; and

>>> (d)    all other relevant circumstances.

>> …

>> (5)    Notwithstanding any provision in any written law, a term of imprisonment imposed on any person as an enhanced sentence under this section shall run consecutively to all other terms of imprisonment imposed on him.

>> **50Y.** – (1)    A person who commits a serious breach of a mandatory aftercare condition of his remission order shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to –

>>> (a)    imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order, as determined based on the date of the offence; …

>> (2)    In deciding the punishment to be imposed for an offence under subsection (1), the court shall consider –

>>> (a)    the gravity of the serious breach;

>>> (b)    the length of time for which the person did not commit any breach of a mandatory aftercare condition after being released under the remission order;

>>> (c)    whether the serious breach evidences a lack of commitment by the person to his rehabilitation and reintegration into society;

>>> (d)    all other relevant circumstances.

>> …

>> (5)    Notwithstanding any provision in any written law, a term of imprisonment imposed on any person as an enhanced sentence under this section shall run consecutively to all other terms of imprisonment imposed on him.

#### Sentence for the FPUT offence

29     In deciding on the appropriate sentence for the FPUT offence I found that specific deterrence was the primary sentencing consideration. I took into account that the Accused had a previous conviction in April 2016 for the same offence. On that occasion, the District Court sentenced the Accused to six months’ imprisonment. The Accused had a history of convictions for drug related offences. Most pertinently, he had been convicted in September 2011 and April 2016 for offences of consumption of morphine and methamphetamine respectively. For the offence committed in April 2016, the Accused was sentenced to five years imprisonment and three strokes of the cane.

30     On 13 January 2020, barely four months after his release from Prison on 14 September 2019, the Accused failed to present himself for his urine test. This was not a one-off aberration by the Accused as he continued to avoid attending urine tests on a further eight occasions until the last test that he was required to present himself for on 10 February 2020. On 13 February, the requirement for supervisees to present themselves for testing was suspended in line with the safe distancing measures implemented to deal with the Covid-19 outbreak.

31     I found that the principle of escalation of the sentence was applicable in this case. The principle of escalation was a reformulation of the longstanding principal that specific deterrence may justify a longer term of imprisonment being imposed on a persistent offender in light of his antecedents, if these reflected a tendency for repeat offending or a marked proclivity toward criminal offending: _PP v Low Ji Qing_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 769</span> at \[56\].

32     The principle of escalation is invoked to cumulatively increase sentences to reflect the fact that prior sentences have failed to stop an Accused from committing similar offences: _Low Ji Qing_ at \[58\] and \[59\].

33     The Court should consider the Accused’s antecedent record to determine whether a cycle of offending exists, and if so, what has been the trend of the offending behaviour. An escalation of sentences may be warranted where the Accused’s behaviour discloses a “cavalier disregard for the law”: _Tan Kay Beng_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 10</span> at \[16\] or that the current offence is not a passing lapse but rather evidences a real unwillingness to comply with the law: _Low Ji Qing_ at \[62\].

34     In view of the fact that the Accused had committed the FPUT offence within four months of being released from Prison for, _inter alia_, the **same** offence demonstrated that he had a cavalier disregard for the law. This was emphasised by the fact that the Accused had failed to present himself on not just the three occasions that he was charged with but over nine occasions. I found that the principle of escalation applied and that a sentence greater than the Accused’s previous sentence was warranted.

35     Having taken into account the fact that the Accused had pleaded guilty at the earliest possible opportunity, I imposed a sentence of nine months’ imprisonment.

#### The enhanced sentence of imprisonment under s 50T(1)(a)

36     The commission of the FPUT offence during the remission period resulted in a breach of the basic condition of the remission order and, as such, the Accused was liable to an additional sentence, beyond the sentence for the FRUT offence, up to a maximum of 518 days (the remaining duration of the remission order). The determination of the length of that sentence was with reference to the factors stipulated in s 50T(3)(a) to (d).

##### (1)   Gravity of the offence

37     The reference at s 50T(3)(a) to gravity of the offence refers to the gravity of the offence that gave rise to the breach of the remission order, in the present case the FPUT offence. Whilst an FPUT offence is not the most grave offence in the pantheon of drug-related offences it is nonetheless a serious offence as it carries a maximum sentence of four years’ imprisonment.

38     It was also vital to consider the reason why an Accused person, especially one who has antecedents for consumption of controlled drugs, is placed on a supervision order was to provide a means of monitoring whether he lapses back into consuming drugs. The supervision order has a salutary effect on a person undergoing supervision, as it is acts as a deterrent to that person as he knows that if he consumes drugs this would be easily detected. Therefore, a failure to present himself for a urine test is, in my opinion, a serious offence as it affords the Accused the opportunity to fall back into consuming drugs.

39     As such, I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that on this factor the Accused’s breach was moderately severe.

##### (2)   Similarity of the offence

40     This factor[^3] required a consideration of the nature of the offence for which the Accused was placed on the remission order and the of offence that he committed that breached the remission order. In the present case the Accused had been serving a sentence for an LT1 consumption and a FPUT offence.

41     Therefore, the current FPUT offence was identical to one of the offences that gave rise to the remission order. I also found that the current FPUT offence was also very similar to the LT1 consumption offence. This was because the necessity for the Accused to present himself for urine tests was to deter him from committing further consumption of drug offences. By committing the FPUT offence, the Accused has afforded himself the opportunity to commit consumption offences.

42     I noted that the FPUT component of the Accused’s overall sentence in 2016 (of five years and six months) was a relatively small proportion of that sentence (six months). Nonetheless, I considered that as there was a strong similarity between the current FPUT offence and both the earlier FPUT ofences and the LT1 consumption offence it was appropriate to consider the whole of the outstanding remission period, and not just the component that may apply to the previous FPUT offence, in determining the appropriate enhanced sentence under section 50T(1)(a).

43     I found that on this factor the breach was of high severity.

##### (3)   Length of time after release

44     The third factor[^4] that the court had to consider was the length of time after the Accused was released that he remained crime free. Intuitively, the less time that the Accused remained crime free after release the more serious the breach of the remission order.

45     In the present case, the Accused re-offended within four months of being released. The full duration of the Accused’s remission period was 22 months. As such, I found that with regard to this factor the breach was of high severity as the Accused had only managed to remain crime free for a relatively short period of time.

##### (4)   All other relevant circumstances

46     This factor[^5] is a catch-all provision. The Prosecution submitted that the Court should take into account other aggravating or mitigating factors. In the present case, there are no aggravating factors and I would accept the Prosecution’s submission that there are mitigating factors, i.e. that the Accused had pleaded guilty and that during the period when he was released he was gainfully employed. As such, I found that on this factor the breach was of low severity.

##### (5)   Sentence

47     Having established the severity of the breach with respect to each of the factors in s 50T(3), I placed the Accused’s breach at the high side of moderate severity. The sentencing ranges based on a three sentencing bands approach of (low, moderate and high severity) would be, for moderate severity, between 173 days (1/3 of 518 days) to 345 days (2/3 of 518 days).

48     Having found that the Accused’s breach was at the higher side of moderate severity I found that a sentence of approximately 55% of the remaining duration of the remission period was appropriate. As such, I imposed an enhanced sentence of imprisonment of 285 days.

#### Sentence for the s 50Y(1)(a) offence

49     The factors to be considered when deciding on the sentence for this offence are found in s 50Y(2)(a) to (d) of the PA. The Prosecution set out a proposed sentencing framework in their skeletal submissions. I agreed with the proposed framework and the analysis of how to calibrate the sentence.

50     With regard to the gravity of the breach[^6] the considerations are the duration of the breach and the motivations for the breach. The duration of the breach was relatively short, in fact it was only eight hours longer than the minimum period of 24 hours that is required to constitute a serious breach. There was no evidence that the breach was motivated by any other nefarious reason. The Accused did not commit other offences during the period that he had breached his curfew. The Statement of Facts indicated that the Accused’s reason for breaching curfew was to attend to a family matter. In view of these factors, I agreed that the Accused’s culpability for this factor was at the lower end of low culpability.

51     For the factor on the length of time that the Accused had not committed a breach of the MACs[^7], the Prosecution had submitted that if the breach was committed more than four months after the accused was released under the remission order his culpability should be assessed as low. The Accused committed the breach more than six months after he had been released under the remission order. I concurred that the Accused’s culpability for this factor should be assessed as very low.

52     As to whether the breach evidenced a lack of commitment by the Accused to his rehabilitation and reintegration[^8], I concurred that there was little evidence that the breach was motivated because the Accused was not committed to his rehabilitation. As the Accused was gainfully employed at the time that he committed the breach, as he had not committed any other crimes and as he had surrendered himself at the halfway house, I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that the Accused’s culpability for this factor was very low.

53     Finally for the factor under s 50Y(2)(d), I noted that there were no other aggravating factors and there was the mitigating factor that the Accused had pleaded guilty at the first possible instance. I concurred with the Prosecution that his culpability for this factor was low. I agreed that the Accused’s overall culpability for the section 50Y(1)(a) offence was very low and, as such, the sentence should be at the lowest end of Band 1[^9]. I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that a sentence of 22 days imprisonment was appropriate.

## Conclusion

54     As required under s 50T(5) and s 50Y(5) of the PA, I ran all the sentences of imprisonment consecutively. The global sentence was 9 months’ and 307 days’ imprisonment.
