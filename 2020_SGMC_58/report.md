Damages – Measure of damages – Personal injuries cases

1 December 2020 - Judgment reserved.

### Deputy Registrar Lim Wen Juin:

1       This is an assessment of damages in a motor accident case. The plaintiff sustained personal injuries in a collision on 9 March 2014 between the car in which she was a passenger and a car driven by the defendant. Pursuant to a consent interlocutory judgment dated 28 June 2017 the defendant is to pay 100% of the damages assessed to be due to the plaintiff.

2       In terms of physical injury – as opposed to psychiatric or psychological injury – there is no dispute that the plaintiff sustained various lacerations, abrasions and contusions, and that one of the lacerations left a scar. The complete catalogue of the plaintiff’s physical injuries is as follows:

> (a)     four facial lacerations comprising (i) one on the forehead measuring 6 cm in length, (ii) one over the right side of the nose measuring 3 cm in length, (iii) one below the left eyebrow measuring 1 cm in length, and (iv) a “minor” one on the lower lip;

> (b)     abrasions on the left knee and a superficial laceration on the right leg measuring 2 cm in length;

> (c)     an oblique scar on the forehead measuring between 6 and 8 cm in length; and

> (d)     upper chest and right shoulder contusion with shortness of breath.

3       As for psychiatric injury, although the plaintiff initially alleged post-traumatic stress disorder she has in her written closing submissions premised her claim on a diagnosis of acute stress disorder instead. Notwithstanding this the defendant’s primary position remains that the plaintiff did not suffer any psychiatric injury at all and thus should not be awarded any damages under this head of claim.

4       The plaintiff claims general damages for pain and suffering for the undisputed physical injuries and the disputed psychiatric injury set out above. In respect of the scar on her forehead the plaintiff also claims damages for the cost of future medical treatment. Finally, the plaintiff claims special damages under the following heads:

> (a)     medical expenses;

> (b)     transport expenses;

> (c)     repair of watch, replacement of spectacles, and hair wash; and

> (d)     pre-trial loss of earnings.

## General damages for pain and suffering

### Lacerations, abrasions and scar

5       The plaintiff submits that a total award of $7,000 is warranted as general damages for the facial lacerations, the left knee abrasions and the laceration on the right leg, and that $3,000 is appropriate as general damages for the scar on the forehead. The defendant submits that a global award of $2,500 for all these physical injuries would be adequate.

6       Considering first the facial lacerations, I accept that the _Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases_ (Academy Publishing, 2010) (“_Guidelines_”) and the precedents cited by the plaintiff in her written submissions suggest that an award in the region of $2,500 to $3,000 would be apt for a single facial laceration that is about 3 cm in length – or multiple lacerations of similar size confined within a small region of the face –calling for some degree of non-major medical treatment such as wound dressing or suturing. The precedents cited by the plaintiff were:

> (a)      _Iven Ong v Sim Meng Chiew_ (MC Suit No 30427 of 2009), summarised in _Practitioners’ Library – Assessment of Damages: Personal Injuries and Fatal Accidents_ (LexisNexis, 3rd ed, 2017) (“_Practitioners’ Library_”) at p 903, in which $2,500 was awarded for “lacerations on left side of forehead” that required wound dressing.

> (b)      _Louais a/l Lawrence v Soon Thuan Chong_ (DC Suit No 4208 of 2010), summarised in _Practitioners’ Library_ at p 918, in which $2,500 was awarded for a “2 cm laceration of left nasal ala” that required toilet and suturing.

> (c)      _Chua Yew Huat v Lim Peh Lee_ (DC Suit No 1611 of 2009), summarised in _Practitioners’ Library_ at p 864, in which $3,000 was awarded for “3 cm lower lip and upper lip lacerations” that required the prescription of antibiotics and chlorohexidine rinse.

7       In this case the plaintiff sustained four distinct lacerations and the medical report of Dr Kolhe Lokesh Krishnaji dated 2 September 2016 records that “suturing was performed”. The report does not specify which particular lacerations required suturing but I think I can adopt the natural and reasonable assumption that it was carried out for the 6-cm forehead laceration at least, this being the plaintiff’s longest laceration, given also that she testified that this laceration required 18 stitches. The defendant challenges the precise number of stitches because it was not stated in the medical reports but I think it unnecessary to make a firm finding on this dispute. The material point is that some form of non-major medical treatment was necessitated.

8       The defendant is correct to say that I ought not simply to ascribe a sum to each laceration individually and then award the aggregate of all those sums because such an approach is liable to lead to overcompensation, and I understand the plaintiff not to dispute this. However, in view of the _Guidelines_ and the precedents set out above it seems to me that the forehead laceration alone might warrant an award in the region of $3,000 to $3,500. That being so it seems to me that the defendant’s submission is unduly low. On the other hand I derive little guidance from a precedent cited by the plaintiff – _Rehana binte Abdul Hamid v Ng Hak Tong @ John Ng_ (DC Suit No 4040 of 2008), summarised in _Practitioners’ Library_ at p 859 – in which $15,000 was awarded because that award was for multiple permanent scars in addition to multiple lacerations and one of the lacerations was significantly more serious in that there were glass fragments in the wound. Steering a middle course I think that $5,000 is appropriate for the facial lacerations.

9       As for the left knee abrasions and the laceration on the right leg, these appear to be relatively minor superficial injuries leading to pain and suffering of a temporary nature for which a total of $1,000 would be reasonable compensation. Hence I assess general damages for all the plaintiff’s lacerations and abrasions at $6,000.

10     Turning to the scar on the plaintiff’s forehead, although it appears that the scar is not keloidal in nature and does not otherwise possess features that would give it exceptional prominence visually such as hyperpigmentation, I accept on the basis of the medical report of Dr Gale Lim dated 2 December 2016 that even as at 17 October 2016, more than two years after the accident, the plaintiff’s scar remained “very visible and disfiguring due to the contour deformity in the skin” even though it had by then become “mature and soft”. The range provided in the _Guidelines_ for a single scar is $1,500 to $3,000, and it is an accepted principle in the _Guidelines_ that the age and gender of the injured party matters: it is said that one of the factors that would make the “higher range of the award” appropriate is the fact that “the injured person is a young female”. Given that the forehead is a highly conspicuous part of the body, and given the gender and age of the plaintiff – she was 35 years old at the time of the accident – I think that a sum near the highest end of the range is warranted and so assess general damages for the scar at $2,800.

### Upper chest and right shoulder contusion with shortness of breath

11     For the upper chest and right shoulder contusion with shortness of breath the plaintiff submits $3,000 as general damages while the defendant submits $800. It is not disputed that the plaintiff saw an orthopaedic specialist, Dr Li Yung Hua, on 17 March 2014, which was about a week after the accident. It is apparent from the medical evidence that on Dr Li’s instructions X-rays were taken of the plaintiff’s chest and right shoulder and a CT brain scan was done in response to her complaints of headache. On this basis I accept that the chest and shoulder contusion caused the plaintiff pain and suffering that more than a week later remained substantial enough to prompt a medical consultation and consequent diagnostic tests. For that reason I accept that there is cause for the award in the plaintiff’s case to go beyond the sums provided in the _Guidelines_ for contusions, that is $1,000 for a contusion to the chest and $500 for a contusion to other parts of the body.

12     I take guidance from the two precedents cited by the plaintiff: in _Louais a/l Lawrence v Soon Thuan Chong_, previously mentioned above, $2,000 was awarded for a right shoulder contusion, and in _Choo Lee Peng Geraldine v Dennis Ralph Cambel Celestial and Anor_ (DC Suit No 1710 of 2011), summarised in _Practitioners’ Library_ at p 519, $2,000 was awarded for a contusion of the right chest wall. I add a slight uplift to take into account the plaintiff’s complaint of shortness of breath as well as the relatively prolonged duration of the pain and suffering and assess general damages for her chest and shoulder contusion at $2,200. This yields an aggregate award of $11,000 for her physical injuries which I consider on a global basis to be adequate compensation given that these injuries largely resolved within a month or two of the accident and have ultimately not had any lasting non-cosmetic effects.

### Acute stress disorder

13     The plaintiff submits that an award of $3,000 is warranted as general damages for her acute stress disorder. The defendant’s primary position is that the plaintiff suffered no psychiatric injury or mental disorder that would merit an award of general damages, but his fall-back position is that an award of $300 would suffice. Given that a specialist in psychological medicine, Dr Tian Cheong Sing, felt able to opine in his medical report dated 22 March 2017 that the plaintiff “suffered from an Acute Stress Disorder in the immediate aftermath of the road traffic accident” and did not recant this view in any way under examination in court, I am compelled to reject the defendant’s primary position and hold that the plaintiff did suffer psychiatric injury in the form of acute stress disorder for which general damages ought in principle to be awarded.

14     Having said that I find that the plaintiff’s acute stress disorder was far from severe. As Dr Tian observed, her symptoms were confined to feelings of anxiety and did not involve “flashbacks and intrusive thoughts and imagery related to the accident”. According to Dr Tian’s medical report, by the time he saw the plaintiff on 24 April 2014, about six weeks after the accident, “her anxiety symptoms had abated”. Although Dr Tian recorded that the plaintiff was “preoccupied and self-conscious with the scar on her forehead”, I do not understand this self-consciousness to form any part of the acute stress disorder with which she was diagnosed. In the circumstances I consider that the plaintiff’s acute stress disorder properly falls within the “Minor” category under the heading “General Psychiatric Disorders” in the _Guidelines_ for which the suggested range of awards is $1,000 to $3,000. I see no reason why the lowest sum in that range would not be sufficient compensation and so assess general damages for the plaintiff’s psychiatric injury at $1,000.

## Cost of future medical treatment

15     The plaintiff seeks damages in the sum of $10,500 for the cost of future medical treatment for the scar on her forehead on the strength of Dr Gale Lim’s recommendation in her medical report dated 2 December 2016 that the plaintiff undergo “fractional carbon dioxide laser to improve the contour and texture of the scar”, with “at least 20 sessions” needed just “to see some minimum effect”. Dr Lim estimated that this laser treatment would cost $500 per session and would entail the application of topical creams before and after treatment that would in turn cost about $500.

16     The defendant submits that the plaintiff should not be awarded any damages at all in this regard. The defendant contends, citing the _Practitioner’s Library_ at paras 4-50 to 4-52, that the plaintiff must show that the anticipated medical treatment is “necessary” in order to be awarded damages for it, and that in this instance the laser treatment is not necessary because Dr Lim did not say it was necessary and also did not say that the scar would be permanent, and there is no evidence that the scar is causing the plaintiff pain. I am unable to accept these arguments. Although Dr Lim did not state expressly that the plaintiff’s scar was permanent and that laser treatment was necessary, the fact is that Dr Lim recommended the treatment. I infer from this fact that Dr Lim’s expert opinion was that the scar would not disappear naturally and any cosmetic improvement would have to be made by way of human intervention. To the extent the defendant is saying that laser treatment is unnecessary because the effects of the scar are merely cosmetic in nature, I think that this erroneously takes too narrow a view of the notion of necessity. Given that the purpose of damages is to restore the plaintiff as far as possible to the state she was in before the accident, if the accident has had undoubted effects on her appearance I think that any step required to undo those effects ought to be considered “necessary” for the purpose of assessing damages. Therefore it seems to me that the plaintiff is entitled in principle to claim the cost of medical treatment that she is likely in future to undergo to reverse or reduce any change to her appearance occasioned by the scar.

17     The defendant’s alternative argument is that the plaintiff should be awarded no damages for future medical treatment because she started laser treatment around October 2018 and went for several sessions thereafter but has apparently not gone for further sessions since 4 October 2019, leading to the inference that the treatment is no longer necessary. Although it is somewhat unsatisfactory that the plaintiff appears not to have explained anywhere in her evidence why she has not continued to undergo treatment since October 2019, given Dr Lim’s unchallenged opinion that at least 20 sessions are needed to see “some minimum effect” I am driven to conclude that there is a substantial likelihood that the plaintiff will resume laser treatment in the future to correct the cosmetic effect of the scar. That being the case, following the guidance of the Court of Appeal in _Lua Bee Kiang (administrator of the estate of Chew Kong Seng, deceased) v Yeo Chee Siong_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 SLR 145</span> at \[72\], the plaintiff should in principle be awarded damages in respect of the “appreciable risk” that she will incur the cost of such treatment, albeit with a suitable reduction to take into account the possibility that she will choose after all not to undergo the treatment.

18     Although Dr Lim estimated that each laser treatment session would cost $500, it appears undisputed that for the sessions the plaintiff has attended she paid approximately $220 per session on average, Dr Lim explaining that certain pre- and post-treatment “consumables” were omitted in view of the plaintiff’s budgetary constraints. This suggests to me that these “consumables” may not be strictly necessary and that $500 per session may thus be an overestimate. Adopting a broad-brush basis, I take as a starting point a cost of $300 per laser treatment session. Given that the plaintiff has gone for five or six sessions already she should be entitled to go for at least 15 more sessions. The estimated cost of these 15 sessions is $4,500, and to this I add $500 being the estimated cost of topical creams. I then apply a discount to the aggregate of $5,000 to account for the possibility that the plaintiff might for whatever reason decide not to continue the treatment. Again using a broad brush I apply a 15% discount and assess damages for cost of future medical treatment at $4,250.

## Special damages

### Medical expenses

19     There is no dispute between parties as to $1,760.35 in medical expenses. This aside the defendant objects in principle to compensating the plaintiff for the cost of her medical consultations with Dr Tian as well as the cost of the five or six laser treatment sessions she underwent for her scar. But these objections rest on premises that I have already rejected: I have found on the basis of Dr Tian’s opinion that the plaintiff did sustain some psychiatric injury, albeit of a minor nature, in the form of acute stress disorder, hence I cannot accept the defendant’s submission that the consultations with Dr Tian were unconnected to any injury arising from the accident, and I have concluded that treatment to address the cosmetic effect of the plaintiff’s scar is necessary to restore her to her pre-accident state such that she is entitled to claim from the defendant the cost of such treatment. To my understanding the defendant does not challenge the reasonableness of the cost of each consultation with Dr Tian or of each laser treatment session. Accordingly the plaintiff is entitled to recover from the defendant the cost of three consultations with Dr Tian amounting to $1,288.28 and the cost of the laser treatment sessions being $1,369.76.

20     The rest of the defendant’s objections I agree with. The plaintiff seeks to recover the cost of a consultation at the Eastern Hougang Eye Specialist on 26 May 2014, about seven weeks after the accident, in the sum of $144, but in the absence of any diagnosed injury to the eyes or any medical report from that eye specialist I do not see any basis for saying that the consultation was causally connected to the accident. Similarly there is no evidence that the consultation at The Lasik Surgery Clinic on 22 April 2015, more than a year after the accident, for which the plaintiff claims $26.75 was in any way linked to the accident especially given the length of time between the accident and the consultation. The final disputed item of medical expense is the cost of a consultation at the National University Hospital on 16 March 2017 in the sum of $134.80. It appears from Dr Tian’s medical report dated 22 March 2017 that this was a consultation with him, and that it provided an occasion for the plaintiff to request that he provide a medical report in support of her claim in these court proceedings. But given that the plaintiff’s psychiatric symptoms had long since “abated and resolved”, in Dr Tian’s words, and that she could have requested a medical report in writing without seeing him, I cannot consider that the cost of this consultation represented necessary expense. Adding the sums of $1,288.28 and $1,369.76 to the undisputed amount of $1,760.35, I assess damages for incurred medical expenses at $4,418.39.

### Transport expenses

21     The plaintiff claims a total of $696 in damages for transport expenses incurred in going for medical treatment and consultations. She makes this claim on the basis of 17 trips to and from various locations including Khoo Teck Puat Hospital and Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre, and depending on the location her estimated cost of each round-trip ranges from $10 to $60. But there are no taxi receipts or other supporting documents to back these numbers up, and in the absence of such evidence I do not see any ground for allowing in full the plaintiff’s claim in this regard. The defendant is prepared to accept that the plaintiff may recover the cost of 15 round-trips at $30 per round-trip. I find this reasonable and so assess damages for transport expenses at $450.

### Repair of watch, replacement of spectacles and hair wash

22     The defendant does not dispute the plaintiff’s claim for the cost of two hair washes totalling $24 on the strength of her evidence that following treatment of her forehead laceration she had to keep water away from the wound and she could not achieve this without seeking professional help in washing her hair. But the defendant disputes the plaintiff’s claims for the cost of repairing her watch and replacing her spectacles. Those claims are advanced on the basis that her watch and spectacles were damaged in the accident.

23     As to the watch there is no question that the plaintiff paid $119 on 28 May 2014 to get it repaired. Besides the payment receipt the only document tendered in support of this claim is a “Service Chit” dated 25 April 2014. This evidence shows only that the watch needed repair around that time but it does not seem to me sufficient to show that it needed repair because of the accident. Given the physical injuries that the plaintiff sustained in the accident it is not clear that there was any impact to her wrists or arms, which is where she would reasonably be expected to be wearing her watch, hence it is not evident how the mechanism of the accident could have led to damage to the watch. Furthermore, it appears from the “Service Chit” that the plaintiff sent the watch in for repair around six or seven weeks after the accident. While that is not a very great lapse of time it is not insubstantial either, and so it seems in my view a reasonable possibility that the watch might have been damaged by some other means during the intervening period. There is also the possibility that the watch might already have been in need of repair at the time of the accident due to ordinary wear and tear. Hence I do not think I can say that it is more likely than not that the accident damaged the plaintiff’s watch and caused it to require repair.

24     As for the spectacles, the plaintiff has put forward a receipt dated 25 July 2014 showing that she paid $560 for a pair of spectacles. While there is no dispute that the plaintiff purchased a pair of spectacles I agree with the defendant’s point that without more it seems unlikely that this had anything to do with the accident given that the purchase occurred more than four months after the accident. In cross-examination the plaintiff testified that the spectacles were broken in the accident and that she was able to go without spectacles for more than four months because she used contact lenses and she was at home and did not need to wear spectacles for work. But I think the plausibility of this explanation is undermined by the fact that her medical leave ended on 29 March 2014, suggesting that she returned to work well before July 2014. So far as she testified that she did not bother asking for additional medical leave because she was self-employed, I am not quite convinced by this because her self-employed status did not prevent her from being given further medical leave after the initial period of medical leave had ended on 15 March 2014, and according to her income tax statements the amount of income she earned as a part-time beautician in 2014 was identical to the amount earned in 2015, which I would not expect to see had she missed more than four months of work in 2014.

25     Moreover, given that the purchase of spectacles was closer in time to the consultation at Eastern Hougang Eye Specialist on 26 May 2014 than to the accident, it strikes me as a reasonable possibility that the plaintiff purchased a new pair of spectacles simply because she had learnt at that consultation that her vision required a degree of correction different from what her existing spectacles provided. Although the plaintiff is right to say that it is not inherently unlikely that the accident damaged her spectacles given that the mechanism of the accident was such that there was unquestionably impact to her face, on the whole I do not think I can find that it is more likely than not that this was so. Therefore I cannot conclude that the plaintiff is entitled to damages for the cost of repairing her watch and purchasing a new pair of spectacles. She is entitled only to damages for the cost of the hair washes assessed at $24.

### Pre-trial loss of earnings

26     At the time of the accident the plaintiff was an insurance agent and also working part-time as a beautician. On the basis of her income tax statements I do not think it can be disputed that in the years 2013, 2014 and 2015 she earned $25,746, $20,568 and $16,800 respectively from her work as an insurance agent. She claims that the accident caused the reduction in her income in 2014 and 2015 compared to 2013 and thus seeks to recover from the defendant the shortfalls of $5,178 and $8,946 in those years. She does not allege that there was any diminution in the income she earned as a beautician.

27     The plaintiff testified that her income as an insurance agent was purely commissions-based, meaning it depended entirely on the sales revenue that she could bring about. In her affidavit of evidence-in-chief she said that she “could not concentrate on working as an insurance agent in 2014 and 2015 due to \[her\] facial scar and fear of meeting people”, and in cross-examination she explained that the accident and the scar on her forehead left her “emotionally traumatised” and she refrained from meeting potential clients because of how “distressful” she found it to do so.

28     I can accept that the plaintiff’s scar caused her some measure of emotional distress and made her self-conscious. But to succeed in her claim for loss of earnings the plaintiff must establish on a balance of probabilities that this distress and self-consciousness caused her to be unable to earn commissions that she would otherwise have earned. It seems to me that the evidence she has put forward consists of nothing more than the fact that she earned less income as an insurance agent in 2014 and 2015 than she had in 2013 coupled with her own assertions that she was unable to concentrate on her work and could not meet potential clients. I think that this is far from adequate.

29     To begin with, the mere fact that the plaintiff’s income in 2014 and 2015 fell below her 2013 income level appears to me to be neither here nor there. Given that the plaintiff’s income as an insurance agent was purely commissions-based I would expect it to fluctuate from month to month or year to year even in the normal course of things because the amount of sales revenue generated by an insurance agent can be affected by a wide range of factors including general economic conditions and sheer happenstance. Hence the variation in the plaintiff’s income from 2013 to 2015 does not strike me as something so extraordinary or untoward that the accident is the only probable explanation for it. Next, as the defendant points out, the evidence suggests that the plaintiff did not have difficulty earning income as a part-time beautician in 2014 and 2015. She earned $10,200 from that work in each of those two years. I think I can reasonably assume that her work as a beautician would have involved meeting customers face-to-face. If her scar did not prevent her from doing that, it is not clear why I should think that it held her back from meeting potential clients in her insurance-related line of work.

30     There is then the fact that the plaintiff’s income from her work as an insurance agent climbed to $36,800 in 2016. The plaintiff explained in her affidavit of evidence-in-chief that this was because she decided in 2016 “not to look back on the accident and to start working hard again” out of a need to support her family financially. But what this suggests is that any emotional distress and self-consciousness resulting from the scar was not insurmountable and that it was well within the plaintiff’s ability to decide to overcome it. The fact that the plaintiff saw Dr Gale Lim on 17 October 2016 demonstrates that the scar continued to weigh on her mind for most of 2016 at least. If that posed no impediment to her increasing her commissions-derived income substantially in that year, I have difficulty seeing why it should have had any real effect on her ability to work as an insurance agent in the preceding years. I could go further along these lines: given that the plaintiff thought it fit to start laser treatment for her scar in October 2018 and to continue undergoing it in 2019 it is likely that the emotional effect of the scar persisted throughout 2017 and 2018. Yet it is apparent from her income tax statements that she was able to earn $34,500 in 2017, a substantially higher sum than the $25,746 she had earned in 2013 before the accident. This suggests strongly to me that the emotional distress and self-consciousness brought about by the scar was not an inherent and necessary hindrance to her ability to earn income as an insurance agent. Put another way, so far as the plaintiff’s evidence is that her income dropped in 2014 and 2015 because she was unable to work effectively due to the scar but her income increased in 2016 because she decided definitively “not to look back on the accident” even though the scar continued to affect her appearance, I find this evidence rather too convenient to be credible.

31     For these reasons I am unable to conclude that the accident caused the drop in the plaintiff’s income from her work as an insurance agent in 2014 and 2015 compared to 2013. That said, I accept, as the defendant appears also to do, that the plaintiff lost income by virtue of her inability to work during the 19 days she was on medical leave in the weeks following the accident. To assess this loss I have first to ascertain the plaintiff’s income as at the time of the accident, and I agree with the defendant’s submission that the best method of approximating this is to start with the income that the plaintiff earned as an insurance agent in 2013, which was $25,746. I divide this by 365 to get a rough daily income figure of $70.54, and then I multiply that by 19 and assess damages for loss of earnings at the sum of $1,340.26 that this yields.

## Concluding summary

32     I assess damages at $22,482.65, broken down in the following way:

> (a)     $12,000 as general damages for pain and suffering, comprising the following components –

>> (i)       $6,000 for the facial lacerations, left knee abrasions and the laceration on the right leg,

>> (ii)       $2,800 for the scar on the forehead,

>> (iii)       $2,200 for the upper chest and right shoulder contusion, and

>> (iv)       $1,000 for the acute stress disorder;

> (b)     $4,250 for the cost of future medical treatment;

> (c)     $4,418.39 for incurred medical expenses;

> (d)     $450 for incurred transport expenses;

> (e)     $24 for hair washes; and

> (f)     $1,340.26 for pre-trial loss of earnings.

33     I wish to express my appreciation to counsel on both sides for their careful and comprehensive submissions that assisted me greatly in reaching my decision in this assessment.
