Criminal Procedure And Sentencing – Sentencing – Mandatory minimum sentence – Employment of Foreign Manpower Act Cap 91A, 2009 Rev Ed

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9075/2021/01.\]

25 March 2021

### District Judge Adam Nakhoda:

## Introduction

1       The Accused, the proprietor of a food stall, had employed a foreigner without a valid work pass to assist at his food stall. The Accused pleaded guilty to a single charge under s 5(1) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Cap 91A, 2009 Rev Ed) (“EFMA”). As this was the Accused’s second conviction for an offence under s 5(1) of the EFMA he was liable to be punished with the mandatory minimum fine and mandatory minimum imprisonment under s 5(6)(b)(i) of the EFMA. I sentenced the Accused to the mandatory minimum sentence of one months’ imprisonment and a fine of $10,000. The Accused being dissatisfied with the sentence has appealed.

2       The Accused had paid the fine of $10,000. After the Accused indicated that he intended to appeal the sentence I granted his application for bail pending appeal and fixed the bail quantum at $20,000. As at the date of this decision the Accused has not been bailed out and is currently serving his sentence.

## Charges

3       The details of the charge are as follows:

> **MAC 900578 of 2021**

> You, Ahmed Khan, are charged that you, from on or about January 2020 to 24 March 2020, in Singapore, did employ one Dewan Karim (FIN: xxx) as a Stall Assistant without a valid work pass at “Biryani Point”, a food stall located at 18 Raffles Quay #01-20 Singapore 048582, and you have thereby committed and offence under Section 5(1) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Cap 91A, 200 Rev Ed).

> **AND FURTHER**, that you, prior to the commission of the abovementioned offence, were convicted on 30 July 2013 in Court 23 of the then Subordinate Courts for 1 count under Section 5(1) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Chapter 91A, 2009 Rev Ed), which conviction has not been set aside, and you are therefore liable for enhanced punishment under Section 5(6)(b)(i) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Chapter 91A, 2009 Rev Ed).

## Facts

4       The Accused is Ahmed Khan, a 54-year old male Singaporean Permanent Resident. The Accused was the operator of a food stall, “Biryani Point” (“the food stall”), located at 18 Raffles Quay #01-20.

5       Sometime in January 2020, the Accused was approached by one his regular customers, Mr Dewan Karim (“B1”), who asked the Accused if he needed help at the food stall. The Accused replied in the affirmative and engaged B1 to help at the food stall. B1 would work at the food stall from 2.00 p.m. to 5.00 p.m. and from 7.30 p.m. to 9.00 p.m. on weekdays. B1 was tasked with cutting vegetables and was paid $25 for each day’s work.

6       B1, who was studying in Singapore, under a student’s pass was prohibited from taking up any form employment without obtaining the necessary work pass. The Accused despite being aware that B1 did not posses a valid work pass to be employed at the food stall nonetheless employed B1 to work at the food stall from January 2020 till 24 March 2020.

## Issues to be determined

7       The only issue to be determined is whether the sentence imposed was appropriate.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed Penalties

8       An offence under s 5(1) punishable under s 5(6)(b)(i) of the EFMA is punishable with a fine of not less than $10,000 and not more than $30,000 and with imprisonment for a term not less than one month and not more than 12 months. There is a mandatory minimum sentence of a fine of $10,000 and one months’ imprisonment.

### Antecedents

9       The Accused had one prior antecedent, on 20 July 2013, the Accused had been sentenced to pay a fine of $5,000 for an offence under s 5(1) read with s 5(6)(a) of the EFMA.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

10     The Prosecution sought the mandatory minimum sentence of a fine of $10,000 and one months’ imprisonment.

### Mitigation

11     In mitigation, the Accused said that he was sorry for committing the offence and promised not to repeat the offence again.

### Sentencing precedents

12     The Prosecution tendered a table of sentencing precedents. The Prosecution referred to two precedent cases. In _Public Prosecutor v Sheikh Abdullah bin Sheikh Mohamed_ (MAC 910692 of 2019 and another) the offender had been sentenced to pay a fine of $10,000 (in default one months’ imprisonment) and to one months’ imprisonment for an offence under s 5(1) punishable under s 5(6)(b)(i) EFMA. In that case the offender had employed the illegal employee for approximately two months.

13     In _Public Prosecutor v S Vijaya Rai_ (MAC 391 of 2015 and others) the offender had been sentenced to pay a fine of $10,000 (in default one months’ imprisonment) and to one months’ imprisonment for an offence under s 5(1) punishable under s 5(6)(b)(i) EFMA. In that case the offender had employed the illegal employee for approximately three months.

### Decision on Sentence

#### Relevant legislative provisions

14     The relevant legislative provision of the EFMA are as follows:

> **5.**–(1)    No person shall employ a foreign employee unless the foreign employee has a valid work pass.

> …

> (6)    Any person who contravenes subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence and shall –

>> (_a_)    …

>> (b)    on a second or subsequent conviction –

>>> (i)    in the case of an individual, be punished with a fine of not less than $10,000 and not more than $30,000 and with imprisonment for a term of not less than one month and not more than 12 months; or …

15     It is abundantly clear that the sentence for a repeat offender of an offence under s 5(1) of the EMFA is a mandatory minimum sentence of a fine of not less than $10,000 and a term of imprisonment of not less than one month.

16     The Accused had been convicted on 20 July 2013 for an offence under s 5(1) of the EMFA and, therefore, the current conviction was a second conviction for this offence. As such, the Accused was liable for the mandatory minimum sentence under s 5(6)(b)(i) of the EFMA.

#### Aggravating and mitigating factors

17     I found that there were no aggravating factors that would warrant the imposition of a sentence greater than the mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by s 5(6)(b)(i) of the EFMA. The only aggravating factor would be that the Accused had a relevant previous conviction. However, this factor had already been accounted for by the fact that there was mandatory minimum sentence for repeat offenders. Thus, I did not give further weight to his aggravating factor as to do so may have resulted in double counting.

18     In comparison to the precedent cases I found that the present case was, in fact, more egregious than the _Sheikh Abdullah_ as the period of illegal employment of B1 was between three and four months compared to the two months in _Sheikh Abdullah_. However, I did not think that this merited an uplift in the sentence to be imposed on the Accused.

19     With regard to the mitigating factors, I accepted that the Accused had pleaded guilty at the earliest possible opportunity and that this was indicative of his remorse. Apart from this the Accused’s mitigation was unremarkable.

#### The sentence

20     Having considered the facts of the case and the lack of aggravating factors I imposed the mandatory minimum sentence of a fine of $10,000 and one months’ imprisonment. In addition, I imposed a default sentence of one months’ imprisonment if the fine was not paid. The sentence imposed, being the mandatory minimum sentence, was appropriate and cannot be said to be manifestly excessive.

#### The plead guilty mention

21     Having sentenced the Accused, I was informed that he intended to appeal against sentence. The case was fixed for a further mention on the same day for the Accused to make an application for bail pending appeal. In view of the fact that the mandatory minimum sentence had been imposed, I clarified with the Accused on what aspects of the decision he was appealing against.

22     It would be useful to provide some background to this case. The Accused was charged in Court 4B on 26 January 2021. At that time, the proceeded charge had been read and explained to the Accused in English. The Accused did not inform either the State Court’s interpreter or me that he did not understand English. When asked to state his plea, the Accused informed me that he intended to plead guilty. The case was then fixed for a plead guilty mention (“PG mention”) on 9 March 2021.

23     At the PG mention on 9 March 2021, the Accused informed me that he wished to have his plea taken in Hindi and, as a Hindi interpreter was not available on 9 March 2021, the PG mention was adjourned to 23 March 2021. At the PG mention on 23 March 2021, the charge was read and explained, by the Hindi interpreter, to the Accused and he confirmed that he understood it. The Accused was informed about the prescribed punishment for the offence and the Accused indicated that he understood. Thereafter, the Accused pleaded guilty to the charge and having heard the Prosecution’s submission and the Accused’s mitigation I sentenced the Accused to the mandatory minimum sentence.

24     At the post-sentencing hearing on the issue of bail pending appeal, I took the opportunity to confirm with the Accused if he was only appealing against sentence. He confirmed that his appeal was against sentence. I reminded the Accused that the sentence imposed was the mandatory minimum sentence. At this point the Accused informed me that he was not feeling well, that he had matters to settle and that he did not want to go to jail. I then re-confirmed with the Hindi interpreter that when she read the charge to the Accused prior to him pleading guilty she had read the prescribed punishment to the Accused. The Hindi interpreter confirmed that she had read the prescribed punishment to him.

25     I am satisfied that the Accused was not seeking to retract his guilty plea and that his appeal was brought about primarily because he was unprepared to commence his sentence.

## Conclusion

26     I imposed the mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by s 5(6)(b)(i) of the EFMA. In view of the facts of this case the mandatory minimum sentence was the appropriate sentence and that there are no merits in the appeal.
