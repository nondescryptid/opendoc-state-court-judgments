Damages – Assessment

Damages – Measure of Damages – Personal Injuries Cases

Damages – Special Damages

10 February 2021 - Judgment reserved.

### Deputy Registrar Kevin Kwek:

## Background

1       The plaintiff’s claim is for damages arising from a road traffic accident that occurred on 20 December 2015 between the taxi driven by the plaintiff and the car driven by the defendant. The plaintiff claims that he sustained a neck and lower back injury from the accident.

2       Interlocutory judgment was entered on 4 April 2018 at 100% against the defendant. The matter came before this court for assessment.

3       There were two issues before the court:

> (a)     Did the accident on 20 December 2015 cause the plaintiff to sustain any injuries?

> (b)     If the answer to the first question is “no”, the enquiry ends and no damages will be awarded. If the answer to the first question is “yes”, then what is the appropriate amount of damages to be awarded to the plaintiff?

4       Having considered the evidence and submissions of parties, I find that the plaintiff sustained a minor back and neck sprain from the accident. My award is set out in Table A at the end of this document. These are my reasons for the decision.

## The accident on 20 December 2015 caused the plaintiff to suffer injuries

5       The plaintiff has proven on the balance that the accident on 20 December 2015 had caused him to suffer injuries.

6       Parties had agreed that Dr. Ho Li Chin be called as the single joint expert (“SJE”) in this matter under Order 108 of the Rules of Court. Given that Dr. Ho was the SJE and an independent witness, both counsel _cross-examined_ Dr. Ho during the assessment.

7       In general, I found the SJE’s testimony to be measured and credible. In finding that the accident had caused the plaintiff to suffer injuries, I was persuaded by the following.

> (a)     Dr Ho recognised that there was always a _possibility_ of the plaintiff being untruthful of his complaints.[^1] However, based on the objective and subjective medical tests conducted on the plaintiff, the SJE was satisfied that plaintiff was unlikely to be untruthful and that the accident did cause the plaintiff to suffer “minor sprain injuries to his spine and back”.[^2]

> (b)     Dr. Ho’s clinic had a policy of noting down in the clinical notes if a doctor was of the view that a patient was being untruthful. In the plaintiff’s case, Dr. Ho noted that there was no evidence of the plaintiff being untruthful.[^3]

> (c)     Dr. Ho confirmed on the stand that he could “safely say”[^4] that the diagnosis of whiplash injury and lower back sprain stood.

8       The defendant's position was that the accident on 20 December 2015 did not cause any injuries to the plaintiff. I will address these arguments.

9       Perhaps the most persuasive evidence in favour of the defendant’s case were the photographs taken post-accident showing minimal damage to both the plaintiff’s taxi and defendant’s car. That alone, however, is not enough (refer to _Daniel Terry v Lee Susan Sauming_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGMC 31</span> at \[17\]). It should be highlighted that the _defendant’s_ surveyor had inspected the plaintiff’s car one day after the accident and noted that the “vehicle sustained damages (_sic_) at the rear portion”[^5]. The defendant’s surveyor even recommended “panel beating and body work inclusive of the repair of rear bumper”[^6]. Faced with this contemporaneous document as well as the SJE’s evidence that the accident caused the plaintiff to suffer some minor injuries, the defendant could perhaps have called an accident reconstructionist to give evidence to support his case theory that the impact between the cars was minimal and could not have caused the plaintiff to sustain any injuries. This was not done. The defendant’s case, in the circumstances, was unsupported by evidence.

10     Second, the defendant submitted that the plaintiff was inconsistent in his police report and Singapore Accident Statement (“SAS”) as to whether the plaintiff sustained any injuries from the accident. The timeline based on the contemporaneous documents is as follows.

> (a)     The accident occurred on 20 December 2015 at 6.30 p.m. According to the plaintiff, he felt pain immediately after the accident and the day after when he woke up.[^7]

> (b)     On 21 December 2015 - a day after the accident - the plaintiff visited the SJE’s clinic at 11.19 a.m.[^8] The plaintiff was prescribed muscle relaxants and issued five days of outpatient medical leave.

> (c)     A few hours after visiting the clinic, the plaintiff submitted a police report at 1.43 p.m.[^9] In this police report, the plaintiff stated under “brief details” that “none of us was injured during the incident”. It should be noted however that in the _same_ report, the plaintiff stated that he went to the clinic to seek treatment as he “felt pain on my neck” and that his “degree of injury” was “slight”.[^10]

> (d)     At about 4.13 p.m., the plaintiff submitted his SAS.[^11] In the question “was any body (_sic_) injured in the Accident?”, the plaintiff answered “no”.

> (e)     At about 6.30 p.m., the plaintiff submitted an amendment to his police report stating “… I felt pain on neck and on my back then I went to seeks (_sic_) treatment”.

11     The defendant submits that the amendment to the police report in \[e\] above was an afterthought and that the plaintiff did not sustain any neck or back pain at all. I disagree.

> (a)     I found nothing untoward in the chronology of events above and the fact that plaintiff amended his police report to include that he felt pain on his back (in addition to the pain on his neck as stated in his earlier report).

> (b)     The plaintiff’s complaints of neck and back pain are corroborated by the independent SJE’s evidence.

> (c)     I was satisfied with the plaintiff’s explanation on why he had stated in the police report and SAS that no one was injured in the accident. He had explained on the stand that his definition of sustaining an injury meant the victim having suffered from _visible_ injuries i.e. with “blood” and requiring the need to “call an ambulance”.[^12] In other words, according to the plaintiff’s definition, given that the plaintiff did not suffer any _visible_ injuries requiring ambulance services to be activated, this therefore did not constitute an “injury” in the plaintiff’s mind.

> (d)     In any event, I found no contradiction in his reports given that he had stated in his initial police report that the degree of injury was “slight”.[^13] The last point to note was that the police report, the amendment and the SAS were all filed on the same day, one day immediately after the accident. These contemporaneous documents suggest that the injuries were more likely than not sustained from the accident rather than a belated afterthought on the part of the plaintiff.

## Quantification of Damages

12     Having found that the accident had caused the plaintiff to sustain some injuries, I proceed with the quantification of damages. As mentioned above, I found no reason to doubt the SJE’s evidence that the plaintiff had suffered a neck and lower back sprain.

### Neck Sprain

13     The plaintiff submitted that $5,000 should be awarded, whereas the defendant submitted that $100 be awarded. The plaintiff argued that $5,000 would be a reasonable award given that the SJE had indicated that the plaintiff had suffered a Grade 1 whiplash injury. According to the _Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases_ (2010) Edition (“_Guidelines_”), the court was faced with two categories of injury which the plaintiff’s neck sprain could fall within:

![]([2021] SGMC 0006_Image/[2021] SGMC 0006_image1.png)

14     At first glance, it _appears_ that the plaintiff’s injury falls into Category (ii) above given the “Grade 1 whiplash injury” diagnosis by the SJE. However, as it was highlighted in _Yap Pow Kin v Muhammad bin Johari_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGMC 40</span> (“_Yap Pow Kin_”), the focus should be less on the technicalities and semantics of the diagnosis and more on the degree of the pain and suffering that resulted from the injury. In this regard, a closer analysis of both categories in the _Guidelines and_ actual injuries suffered by the plaintiff – as diagnosed by the SJE – would indicate that the plaintiff’s neck injury fell more accurately in Category (iii). I elaborate below.

15     In order for a neck injury to fall within Category (ii), the symptoms of neck pain, tenderness and stiffness is likely to resolve completely between a few weeks and two years. The SJE did not suggest that the plaintiff’s injury was serious enough to fall within Category (ii). On the contrary, in finding that the plaintiff’s injury would more accurately fall within Category (iii), I gave significant weight to the following:

> (a)     The SJE gave evidence that the plaintiff’s neck injury was the “…_mildest_ with just a complaint of pain but with _no significant physical findings_” (_emphasis added_).[^14]

> (b)     The SJE testified that the plaintiff’s neck injury could resolve within a week and even within a day provided the plaintiff took the muscle relaxants to supress the symptoms.[^15]

> (c)     The SJE was of the view that there would be no future physical disabilities or complications.[^16]

> (d)     The plaintiff was treated conservatively and given only five days of medical leave.

16     For the above reasons, I find that a reasonable sum to award is $2,500.

### Lower Back Sprain

17     The plaintiff submitted that $10,000 should be awarded for this head of claim whereas the defendant submitted $100.

18     The court was faced with two categories of injury under the _Guidelines_ which the plaintiff’s lower back sprain could fall within:

![]([2021] SGMC 0006_Image/[2021] SGMC 0006_image2.png)

19     The plaintiff’s submission of $10,000 is unsupported by the evidence. An award in Category (ii) above would be more appropriate given the following.

> (a)     The SJE was of the view that the back sprain sustained by the plaintiff was “minor”[^17] and “unlikely to persist \[for\] more than a few weeks”[^18].

> (b)     The SJE stated that an examination of the plaintiff’s lumbosacral spine one day after the accident showed “slight restriction in \[the plaintiff’s\] spinal movements”.[^19] During cross-examination, the SJE clarified that any restriction felt by the plaintiff would have been “very slight only” and even suggested that it was “likely” that there was actually no restrictions in the plaintiff’s spinal movements.[^20]

> (c)     The SJE confirmed during cross-examination that he stood by his initial diagnosis of the plaintiff[^21] i.e. that the plaintiff suffered a minor back sprain and that there would be no future physical disabilities or complications.

> (d)     The plaintiff was treated conservatively and given only five days of medical leave.

20     The plaintiff invited the court to award a higher sum in light of an alleged aggravation of a “pre-existing condition” at the plaintiff’s L5 vertebrae. This condition was identified when the plaintiff underwent an X-ray at Clementi Polyclinic on 22 February 2016 i.e. _more than 2 months after the accident_. Even though the X-ray indicated a “minor osteophytic lipping” at the L5 vertebrae, the X-ray findings were described as “unremarkable”[^22] by the resident physician at Clementi Polyclinic. While the SJE was of the view that the accident could _possibly_ aggravate a pre-existing condition, the SJE candidly admitted that there was no evidence _at the time of accident_ that the plaintiff had such a condition.[^23]

21     At this juncture, I should highlight that while this may be a simplified matter under Order 108 of the Rules of Court and the claim of relatively low value, the plaintiff nonetheless still bears the burden of proving every material facet of his case on a balance of probabilities: _Yap Pow Kin_ at \[21\]. The plaintiff’s submission that “the degenerative changes were clearly asymptomatic and were aggravated only because of the road traffic accident”[^24] was _not_ a finding made by the SJE and remains a bare assertion by the plaintiff.

22     It should be reiterated that the minor osteophytic lipping was only identified more than two months after the accident. What is most crucial is that the plaintiff has not proven that he had a pre-existing condition _at the time of accident and that the accident had aggravated the condition_. The SJE’s oral evidence is telling in this regard:

>   
| 

DC:

 | 

_Given that there are no other factors or incidents between the accident and the time he came to see Dr. Ng, can you safely say that the diagnosis of whiplash injury and lower back sprain is correct?_

 |
| 

A:

 | 

_Yes._

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

And there is an aggravation of his pre-existing condition at L5?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

_At that point of time at Mount Alvernia, we had no evidence of his pre-existing condition, he did not mention it._

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

Did the Plaintiff ever mention that he had any neck or back injury?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

No, he did not mention to the triage nurse or Dr. Ng.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

_Based on the evidence before you, you can safely say the diagnosis stands?_

 |
| 

A:

 | 

_Yes._

 |
| 

_(emphasis added)_

 |

  
  

23     Even if I am wrong and that there was a pre-existing injury on the date of the accident, this would not assist the plaintiff’s case in seeking an award under Category (i) of the _Guidelines._ In order for this injury to fall within Category (i) i.e. range of $2,000 to $10,000, the plaintiff must prove that the injury would only be resolved in the medium term i.e. within five years. It is pertinent to note that during the cross-examination by both counsel, the SJE’s steadfast position despite being shown the damage pattern of the vehicles and two months post-accident X-ray of the plaintiff was that he would maintain his earlier diagnosis i.e. that the plaintiff sustained a minor back injury and that there would be no future physical disabilities or complications.

24     In light of the above, an award in Category (ii) is more appropriate and I quantify this head of claim at $1,800.

### Special Damages

25     The general rule is that special damages have to be strictly proven otherwise they are not recoverable: _Wee Sia Tian v Long Thik Boon_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 2 SLR(R) 420</span> at \[15\]. In addition, medical expenses are claimable if they relate to the injuries suffered by the plaintiff: Carrie Chan et el, _Practitioners’ Library – Assessment of Damages: Personal Injuries and Fatal Accidents_, LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, at \[2-6\].

26     I will allow the plaintiff’s claim for medical expenses for his consultation at the SJE’s clinic one day after the accident i.e. $78.30. With regards to his other medical expenses incurred from 22 February 2016 onwards at the other clinics for medical consultation and physiotherapy, I find that the plaintiff is not entitled to a reimbursement of these expenses.

27     As I had explained earlier, while the SJE was of the view that a front-to-rear collision could possibly aggravate a pre-existing condition, there was no evidence at the time of accident that the plaintiff had such a condition. Further, after given the opportunity to review the medical documents in relation to the subsequent consultations on and from 22 February 2016 onwards, the SJE maintained his initial diagnosis made on 21 December 2015 that the plaintiff merely suffered “minor sprain injuries to his spine and back”.

28      _Most crucially_, the SJE was of the view that plaintiff did not require physiotherapy treatment – the SJE’s report stated: “\[n\]o physiotherapy appointment was given”.[^25] The fact that the plaintiff may have gone for several physiotherapy sessions months after the accident does not automatically entitle him to make a claim for such expenses – the plaintiff still has to specifically prove that the expenses were incurred because of the injuries suffered from the accident and reasonable in the circumstances. The plaintiff has failed to do so. As a final point, I should add that the SJE appeared to cast some doubts during the cross-examination on the seriousness of the plaintiff’s back injury given the plaintiff’s delay in seeking physiotherapy treatment.[^26]

29     For the reasons above, I find that the plaintiff is only entitled to his transport expenses incurred in relation to his trip to and from the SJE’s clinic one day after the accident. In the absence of receipts of such expenses being incurred, I accept defendant counsel’s submission of $26.80 to be reasonable: refer to _Tan Hun Boon v Rui Feng Travel Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 244</span> at \[146\].

30     The plaintiff is not entitled to his claim for loss of income. I agree with the defendant that the plaintiff has failed to prove this head of claim. The plaintiff has not adduced any evidence of his income and whether he had worked or not during the five days on which he was on medical leave. The plaintiff could simply have adduced a copy of his taxi log book to prove that he was not working on 21 to 25 December 2016. He failed to do and has not specifically proven this head of claim.

## Conclusion

31     For the reasons above, final judgment is entered whereby the defendant shall pay the plaintiff the sum of $4,300 in general damages and $105.10 in special damages.

32     I will hear parties on any consequential orders and costs.
