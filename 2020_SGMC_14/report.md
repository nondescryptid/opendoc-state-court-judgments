### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## A.   Background

#### The Charges

1       The accused, Ms Bibianna Lim Poh Suan, a 47 year-old female Singapore citizen had claimed trial to four charges involving three victims, namely _two charges_ of voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.) in **MAC 907035 - 2018** and **MAC 907036 - 2018**, _one charge_ of mischief under s 426 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.) in **MAC 907037 - 2018** and _one charge_ of causing hurt by doing an act so rashly as to endanger human life in **MAC 907038 - 2018** under s 337(a) of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.). The proceeded charges against her are as follow:

1ST CHARGE (Amended)

2ND CHARGE (Amended)

2       On 5 December 2019, at the conclusion of the trial and after a careful consideration of the totality of the evidence as well as the written submissions before me, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt on all four of the proceeded charges in **MAC 907035 - 2018** to **MAC 907038 - 2018**. I did not accept her defence that was essentially a bare denial of the first amended charge, the third amended charge as well as the fourth amended charge and her defence that she had acted in self-defence in respect of the second amended charge. Accordingly, I convicted the accused on all of the four charges. This matter was then adjourned for mitigation and sentencing to 16 December 2019 to enable the Prosecution to address the Court on the appropriate sentences to be imposed as well as to enable her Defence Counsel Mr Tan Hee Joek to prepare her written plea in mitigation.

3       On 16 December 2019, after a careful consideration of the Prosecution’s address on sentence, the written plea in mitigation as well as the factual matrix of the charges before me, I imposed the following sentences:

I ordered the sentences for **MAC 907035 - 2018** and **MAC 907036 - 2018** to run consecutively with the remaining charge in **MAC 907038 - 2018** to run concurrently. The global sentence imposed on the accused is twelve weeks’ imprisonment with effect from 16 December 2019, a fine of $800, in default eight days' imprisonment and an order that the accused be disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of twelve months with effect from her date of release from prison.

4       Dissatisfied with my decision, the accused had filed a Notice of Appeal against her conviction and sentences in respect of **MAC 907035 - 2018** to **MAC 907038 – 2018** on 16 December 2019. She is presently on bail pending the hearing of her appeal.

5       I now provide the reasons for my decision.

#### The Trial

## D.   The Prosecution’s Case

#### (i)   MAC 907035 - 2018 – s 323 Penal Code charge

### PW5’s evidence

10     It was the Prosecution’s case that the evidence against the accused take the form of testimony from PW5 that was corroborated by the various medical documents reflecting the injuries she suffered from the attack by the accused. Initially PW5 had testified that on 28 February 2018, she was in the kitchen of the unit at Block 17 Eunos Crescent when the accused rushed into the unit, approached her and slapped her many times on the face. She was slapped on the left side of her face very forcefully at least twice. After being slapped, PW5 attempted to escape. In the midst of doing so, she bumped her knee onto the pink tiled wall separating the kitchen from the dining area due to the confined space. As a result, her knee was injured and bleeding, which she realised after she had gone to the police station subsequently. PW5 gave evidence that she felt “very pain” from the slaps and had to take Panadol to curb the pain. She also felt “the stars” on “the left side of her ear as well as heard a ‘ting’ sometimes. She had visited various doctors for her ear problem and underwent hearing tests.

11     When the Defence Counsel made much of the point that there were differences between PW5’s testimony and her investigative statements, PW5 was recalled as a witness and confronted with the differences by the Defence. It was highlighted that she had testified that she was only slapped on the left side of her face while in her statements in _Exhibit D4_ she had stated that she was slapped at least three times on each cheek and in _Exhibit D6_, she had stated that she was slapped a few times on both sides of her face. It was also highlighted that while she testified that her knee injury was sustained in the course of _escaping_ from the accused, in her statements in _Exhibit D5_ and in _Exhibit D6_ she had stated that the accused had _pushed_ her towards the kitchen doorway, causing her to hit her knee on the doorway.

12     It was submitted by the Prosecution that after being recalled, PW5 was initially visibly confused at the fact that her court testimony differed from her statements. It was further submitted that after some time, she had clarified that the accused had pushed her, causing her knee injury and she had slapped PW5 on both sides of her face. It was the Prosecution’s case that PW5 had given cogent, commonsensical and believable reasons for her failure to recount the correct version of events when she first testified.

13     According to PW5, one would “almost forgot everything” when one was testifying in court and when she was in court, she had “mental block already”. In addition, she had testified that she just focused only on the left side as she suffered more pain on that side and it had been “quite long already”. It was the Prosecution’s case that PW5 might have been factually erroneous on certain details when she first testified but was not _dishonestly_ so. It was submitted that it was obvious that, with the passage of time, her recollection of the incident was no longer perfect. She had confirmed that she had never seen her police statements since giving them in February 2018 and March 2018 until she testified in Court on 10 September 2019, a duration of 1½ years.

14     It was also submitted that in fact both areas of differences in her evidence _operated to the benefit of the accused._ PW5 had initially testified to the accused slapping her over _one less part of the face_, and had not incriminated the accused for pushing her. _If anything_, the differences in her testimony underscores the point that she was not one to embellish. It was further submitted that the discrepancy in PW5’s initial and subsequent court testimony pertained only to the _penumbra_ of her evidence, and did not undermine her evidence on the _key_ issues.

15     According to the Prosecution, PW5 had remained steadfast and did not waver in her _core_ evidence on the critical factual issues, _viz_. who slapped her, the circumstances under which she was slapped, the general body part where she was slapped (face), where her knee hit against. It was the Prosecution’s case that PW5 was a truthful witness who was ultimately sure that whatever she had told the police was true. It was submitted that the court should give full weight to PW5’s refreshed testimony that the accused had slapped _both sides_ of her face and pushed her against the kitchen doorway, causing the knee injury.

### PW5’s evidence was corroborated by other evidence

16     It was the Prosecution’s case that PW5’s refreshed testimony was corroborated by various other pieces of evidence namely:

> (a)     The accused’s mother, PW2’s testimony that she personally saw the accused slapping PW5’s face more than one time;

> (b)     The accused’s father, PW4’s testimony that he came out of the bedroom in the unit after hearing commotion, and saw PW5 “holding onto the ear”. This led him to think that the accused had slapped PW5 or something like that;

> (c)      _Exhibit P11_, a photograph taken by PW10 on the night of 28 February 2018 that showed an abrasion injury on PW5’s knee.

> (d)     The NP306 medical complaint form (_Exhibit P15_) dated 28 February 2018 (the day of the incident) reflected that PW5 had complained of being _slapped and pushed_. The document also showed that PW5 had complained of ringing sensation and hearing loss from the left ear, and that there was tenderness under the left temporamandibular junction. Further, there was contusion on her left upper neck and a 1cm x 1cm abrasion on her right knee;

> (e)     The CGH referral dated 1 March 2018 (_Exhibit P14_) detailing the same examination on the night of 28 February 2018, and the CGH medical report dated 7 March 2018 (_Exhibit P2_). _Exhibit P2_ had concluded that PW5 sustained ‘multiple contusions’. _Exhibit P14_ also reflected similar injuries as _Exhibit P15_. It was significant that _Exhibit P14_ reflects that PW5 reported being slapped “over both cheeks multiple times”, “was pushed to the wall”, and “sustained an abrasion over the L tibal tuberosity”. Further, _Exhibit P14_ reflected that a Weber hearing test was carried out which showed localization to the right ear. PW8 Dr Kimberley Kiong explained that this suggests a hearing loss in the left ear;

> (f)     the Marine Parade Polyclinic Medical Report dated 2 May 2019 (Exhibit P16), read together with the clinical notes of PW11 (_Exhibit P17_) showed that as at 7 March 2018, PW5 was still experiencing persistent left ear pain associated with hearing loss. PW11 saw the need to refer PW5 to a specialist on a ‘fast track’ basis.

> (g)     The SGH Hearing Evaluation Report (_Exhibit P5_), medical report dated 8 May 2018 (_Exhibit P6_), clinical notes by PW8 (_Exhibit P8_) and ENT correspondence note (_Exhibit P7_). PW8 had noted in _Exhibit P8_ that PW5 had complained of being slapped “multiple times” and reported initial tinnitus of the left ear, as well as left ear pain. PW7 noted in _Exhibit P7_ that the hearing loss had “improved since the episode”.

> (h)     PW7’s testimony that _Exhibit P5_ reflected a mild frequency (at 250 Hertz) hearing loss in PW5’s left ear – her right ear was able down to 15 decibels, while her left ear could not detect sounds softer than 30 decibels. This difference of 15 decibels was greater than the normal acceptable variation of about 5 to 10 decibels.

17     It was submitted that PW5 had consistently relayed to _different_ doctors, on _different_ days, of having been slapped multiple times by the accused. She had also complained on 28 February 2018 of having been _pushed_. The medical documents _overwhelmingly_ support PW5’s refreshed testimony that she was slapped on both sides of the face, sustaining hearing loss as a result, and was pushed against the kitchen doorway sustain a knee abrasion.

18     It was further submitted that there was no medical evidence of PW5’s hearing abilities prior to being slapped. However, it could be inferred that the slaps were the cause of her hearing loss:

> (a)     PW5 had complained of a _decrease_ in hearing in her left ear, following the incident. _Exhibit P7_ reflects that the alleged hearing loss had _improved_ from 28 February 2018 to 19 March 2018, in line with the medical evidence that sensorineural hearing loss can self-resolve in about one month;

> (b)     PW8 gave evidence that the hearing loss is “consistent with inner ear concussion from the described trauma” (which was PW5’s account of being slapped multiple times “on both sides of her head). Under cross-examination, PW8 clarified that this “included the head and the ear”. PW8 further explained that even if the slaps had landed on the cheeks and not the ear (which, to begin with, are in close proximity), it was still possible to suffer hearing loss “if the force is hard enough”. This is because the force used can potentially be transmitted to the inner ear. The ear canal is “just behind the cheek”, being “very very close”.

### The accused has no tenable defence

19     It was highlighted that the accused claimed that she “never touched” PW5. According to the accused, she was standing in the dining area and could not have physically reached PW5, who was in the kitchen. It was the Prosecution’s case that the accused’s defence was illogical and unbelievable as according to her, as at 18 February 2018, PW5 was someone who was polite, cordial and pleasant to her. Yet, by the day of the offence on 28 February 2018, she had morphed into someone who hurled false allegations at her.

20     It was submitted that this dramatic change was ostensibly due to two disagreements (the ‘MOM incident’ and the ‘Jumbo Incident’) during which the accused alleged PW5 of lying and of manipulating her parents. The accused had alleged that PW5 was _so_ vindictive that she gave false evidence to the police and in court – some 1½ years after the incident – to “get \[her\] into trouble…with the law”. It was further submitted that even more incredulously, the accused postulated that PW5 “could have already plotted” to malign her _on the day of the offence, in the unit itself_. It was highlighted that somewhat inconsistently, the accused had earlier speculated that PW5’s false incrimination was probably instigated by PW1.

21     It was submitted that when confronted with the fact that _both_ her parents had incriminated her for the offence, the accused had insisted that her mother, PW2 was lying, despite having a good relationship with her. The accused had further insisted that her father, PW4 “could have” lied to falsely implicate her. She then said that her mother lied because PW5 threatened her, and her father lied because PW5 was manipulating him. It was the Prosecution’s case that the accused wanted the Court to believe that PW5 was the directing mastermind behind this charge and would go to such great lengths to exact revenge over two disagreements. It was submitted that the accused was clearly offering these absurd theories because she had no defence to the charge.

### DW3’s report should be given no weight

22     It was highlighted that the accused had called DW3 who issued a report dated 14 May 2019 (_Exhibit D9_) and sought to cast doubt on whether PW5 really suffered mild frequency hearing loss caused by the alleged trauma. It was the Prosecution’s case that at the outset, it was obvious from _Exhibit D9_ that DW3 has overstepped his remit. Instead of confining himself to only commenting on the medical evidence at hand in a fair and neutral manner, the tenor of his report suggested that he was actively looking to pick out weaknesses in the medical evidence. It was submitted that he had concluded at \[10\] that there is “_doubt on the Alleged Victim’s claim of hearing loss from trauma to the left ear_”. It was further submitted that this was a conclusion that only the Court could draw and this was not the expert witness’ role. According to the Prosecution, DW3 was not supposed to advocate for the accused.

23     In essence, it was the Prosecution’s case that _Exhibit D9_ was unreliable as it was not prepared with caution, DW3 had made a few observations from a biased standpoint and there were inaccuracies in his report as well as his testimony in Court. It was submitted that under cross-examination, DW3 had ultimately agreed to the following:

> (a)     In a normal person, there _should not_ be a difference in hearing thresholds between the right and left ears at 250 hertz;

> (b)     It was possible that PW5’s hearing loss had improved over the 19 days from 28 February 2018 to when she was seen at SGH on 19 March 2018;

> (c)     If PW5 was being truthful in her reporting, then the two Weber tests and the SGH Hearing Evaluation Report _supports the conclusion_ that she sustained a left sensorineural hearing loss.

It was further submitted that ultimately, DW3’s evidence did not manage to shake PW5’s evidence, which was corroborated by witnesses and supported by various medical examinations.

#### (ii)   MAC 907036 - 2018 – s 323 Penal Code charge

### PW4’s evidence

24     It was the Prosecution’s case that PW4’s evidence was corroborated by the evidence from PW2 and PW5. PW4 had testified that while trying to stop the “struggling” between the accused and PW5, the accused had bit him on the arm, kicked him on the stomach and pushed him.

25     It was submitted that his evidence was corroborated by PW2 and PW5:

> (a)     PW2 had testified that PW4 came out from the bedroom into the hall to stop the accused from slapping PW5 and that “they pushed each other”;

> (b)     PW5 had testified that the accused pushed PW4 causing PW4’s head to knock onto the bedroom door, following which the accused kicked PW4 on the chest area.

### PW4’s evidence was corroborated by objective evidence

26     It was the Prosecution’s case that PW4’s injuries were evinced by the CGH medical report dated 12 March 2018 (_Exhibit P9_) and by PW9’s clinical notes (_Exhibit P10_). PW4 had sustained a 4 cm circular erythema over the left forearm and mild tenderness over the right side upper abdomen that were clearly caused by the accused. It was submitted that the bite mark was also clearly seen on photograph _Exhibit P12_, taken some hours after the incident by PW10.

### The accused has no tenable defence to the charge

27     It was highlighted that the accused did not deny biting and kicking her father, but said that she had absolutely no intention to harm him and that she acted out of “reflex”. It was submitted that this was unbelievable as the manner of the attack and the sequence of events showed that the accused’s actions were _deliberate_ and motivated by rage. Indeed, the accused admitted that she was “very angry that he’s taking side with the maid again”.

28     It was further submitted that the accused had later switched tact and insinuated that she had hurt PW4 due to concern for PW2’s safety, as they were “directly behind” her. It was highlighted that PW2 herself did not testify that the scuffle was near her, or had posed any danger to her. This claim was also not put to her in cross-examination. It was the Prosecution’s case that importantly, the scuffle posed no danger to the _accused_ herself. The accused had testified that PW4 had attempted to throw a chair and interlocked her arms, but later acknowledged the size disparity between herself and PW4 and agreed that he would _not_ have caused her to fear for her life in an altercation.

29     It was further submitted that in a lame attempt to undermine PW4’s injuries, the accused had claimed that they were not due to the force she exerted, but attributable to PW4’s “sensitive skin”. According to the Prosecution, this was a clear example of how belligerent of a witness the accused was. In summary, it was submitted that the accused has no valid defence to the s 323 charge involving PW4.

#### (iii)   MAC 907037 - 2018 – s 426 Penal Code charge

30     t was the Prosecution’s case that PW2 had testified that after attacking PW5 and PW4, the accused “went into the kitchen to throw \[PW5’s\] phone”. PW2 had personally seen PW5’s handphone in the washing machine, and had asked PW5 to pick it up subsequently.

31     It was submitted that PW2’s evidence coheres with PW5’s evidence. PW5 had testified that when she subsequently returned to the unit, PW2 had informed her that she had retrieved her phone from the washing machine, because “Bibianna put your phone inside the washing machine”. PW5 then took a look at the phone and realised that it was wet. She then put her phone into rice for “1 whole night”, having been advised by PW1’s children to do so.

32     It was further submitted that while there was an apparent discrepancy in the evidence in that PW2 said it was PW5 who retrieved the phone while PW5 had said that it was PW2 who had done so, this discrepancy does not materially affect the core question of whether it was _the accused_ who put PW5’s phone inside the washing machine. On this material aspect, it was the Prosecution’s case that PW5’s evidence was consistent with that of PW2, in that the accused had placed her phone into the washing machine. PW5 had testified that as a result, the screen of her phone is blurry sometimes, although the phone was still functional.

33     It was submitted that more importantly, despite the seeming discrepancy, there was other evidence supporting the charge:

> (a)      _Exhibit P18_ is a photograph which showed a phone with screen damage. PW5 had testified that that was the very phone which the accused placed into the washing machine. It was not put to PW5 that this was false;

> (b)     PW10 had testified that on the night of 28 February 2018, PW5 had told her that the handphone was spoilt, having been thrown into the washing machine by the accused. PW10 also gave evidence that she had been told on the same day “about the phone being put inside rice”.

### The accused has no tenable defence to the charge

34     It was highlighted that the accused’s position was that PW5 was again lying when recounting how PW2 said the accused had damaged PW5’s phone. To the accused, on top of having falsely implicated the accused for “the whole entire incident”, PW5 saw fit to _also_ implicate the accused for having damaged her handphone as she was “very opportunistic”. It was submitted that this claim was ludicrous. When confronted with the fact that there was _physical evidence_ of the screen damage to PW5’s handphone as shown in Court, the accused’s position was that PW5 _falsely claimed_ the phone to be the one damaged by the accused on the material day. Incredulously, the accused went further to postulate that PW5 “probably” already plotted to incriminate her for damaging the phone as early as on the night of 28 February 2018 itself.

35     It was further submitted that more importantly the accused’s response when being questioned about the phone in her investigative statement (_Exhibit P19_) was inconsistent with innocence and stood in stark contradiction with her evidence in court. She was asked a simple yes-no question of whether she threw PW5’s phone into the washing machine. She answered that she did not remember. When confronted with her answer, the accused went to lengths to explain how PW5 did not in fact have a phone and that she answered the way she did because she was “very confused”.

36     It was submitted that this explanation was untenable. From a plain reading of the question, there was nothing to be ‘confused’ about. It was hard to fathom a less ‘confusing’ way to ask the question. It was highlighted that in fact, when asked the _same_ question under cross-examination, the accused answered a straight “No.” If the accused truly did not damage PW5’s handphone, she would have similarly answered “No.” in _Exhibit P19_. According to the Prosecution, the fact that she did not was pregnant with meaning. In sum, it was the Prosecution’s case that there was sufficient evidence to show that the accused had deliberately damaged PW5’s handphone.

#### (iv)   MAC 907038 - 2018 – s 337(a) Penal Code charge

37     It was the Prosecution’s case that after committing the three offences above, the accused had gone downstairs of Blk 17 Eunos Crescent where she made to leave the scene in her car. By then, PW1 had arrived and wanted to stop the accused from leaving. However, the accused managed to get to her car and locked herself inside. PW1 then testified that after failing to open the car door, he hit the car screen once, and then went to the front of the car. He stood “pretty near” the car. The accused then accelerated her car forward.

38     It was submitted that to avoid impact, PW1 had jumped on the car bonnet and rolled off the side. He suspected that he was hit in the leg when he felt pain on his knee subsequently when driving to CGH. According to PW1, after hitting him, the accused turned right, opened the window and laughed sarcastically, as if to say “you can’t get me.”

According to the Prosecution, the Defence Counsel did not manage to shake PW1’s testimony in cross-examination, during which PW1 clarified that he was standing about 30 cm from the car.

### PW1’s evidence is consistent with what PW5 witnessed

39     It was submitted that PW5 had similarly testified that after failing to open the accused’s car door, PW1 knocked in the screen of the car once. PW1 then went in front of the car with his body being “very near to the car”. PW5 testified that she then heard “the gear of the car…very loud”, then “ran very fast”. She saw PW1 “turning”. According to the Prosecution, this was consistent with PW1’s earlier description that he ‘rolled’ off the car. PW5 had also testified that the accused drove off, turned right, “opened the window and laugh very loud” as if insulting PW1.

### PW1’s evidence was corroborated by the medical examination

40     It was submitted that the CGH medical report on PW1 (_Exhibit P3_) reflected that PW1’s account to the examining doctor was consistent. PW1 had complained of a painful knee after “jumping onto the bonnet of a car, and rolled off”. Tenderness was noted over his right knee and he was prescribed oral analgesia. It was further submitted that PW1’s testimony was materially corroborated and hence credible.

### The accused has no tenable defence to the charge

41     It was highlighted that the accused claimed that PW1 was lying and that he was in fact _not_ in front of her car. She denied there being any contact between PW1 and her car when she drove off, attributing PW1’s knee injury to his weight. She also claimed that PW5 was lying when she said that PW1 was in front of her car. The accused had claimed that she feared for her life when she saw PW1 charging towards her. According to her, she thought PW1 was going to kill her and break her skull. She wanted to call for the police and felt that she needed immediate help.

42     It was submitted that the accused’s defence is untenable because:

> (a)     There was no basis to genuinely apprehend any danger to her life. The accused had conceded under cross-examination that PW1 had not said that he wanted to kill her and had _stepped aside_ after knocking the car window;

> (b)     She did not in fact seek police help even though she _drove right past police vehicles immediately after_ driving off;

> (c)     She had opened her window and laughed.

43     It was the Prosecution’s case that when confronted with the incredulity of her defence, the accused had changed tact and claimed that she did not seek help from the police officers as she reasoned she could always make a police report at the police post at her block. However, she did not actually do so because she thought that sisters should not make police reports against their brothers – even though she had called the police on PW1 on a separate occasion in November 2017.

44     It was submitted that the above showed that the accused _did not_ fear for her life as she claimed. It was further submitted that the court should believe the evidence of PW1 and PW5 – that the accused drove off when PW1 was standing very near to the car which was an undeniably rash act. There was also no reason to doubt PW1’s evidence that the knee pain was sustained as a result of the incident.

45     It was the Prosecution’s case that there was no reason to believe the accused’s bare denials over the consistent and corroborated accounts of the various witnesses. It was submitted that it had proven the four charges against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. It was further submitted that the accused had been incriminated by multiple witnesses whose testimonies are supported by objective evidence. According to the Prosecution, the testimonies of their witnesses were logical, coherent, and corroborated at material junctures.

46     It was submitted that it was blindingly clear that the accused was a belligerent witness. Often times, she would get agitated and ramble about family history and hidden agendas in response to simple questions. At other times, she became either confrontational, speculative, or accusatory. It was further submitted that the accused’s defence to all four charges lacked credibility, consistency and logic and no weight should be given to her testimony.

## E.   The Defence’s Case

47     It was the case for the Defence that the Prosecution’s case was riddled with material inconsistencies based on a comparison with the Prosecution’s witnesses’ accounts. According to the Defence, it was unclear which witness account was preferred as this was unclear from the Prosecution’s conduct of the trial and there was no attempt by the Prosecution to reconcile their accounts.

48     It was submitted that the discrepancies between the various accounts were highly material and not just minor. By the presence of material consistencies, reasonable doubt would be sufficiently cast on the Prosecution’s case as held by the High Court in _Tay Kok Poh Ronnie v PP_ \[1995\] 3 SLR(R) 5451 at \[39\]:

> “39    The learned DPP urged that the discrepancy could have been due to the fact that different people may have different recollections of what happened. That might well have been the case. However, it could also be that one of them was lying. **_All I can say is that, if that happened on a highly material issue, to the extent that it was capable of throwing doubt on the Prosecution’s case, then that was just too bad for the Prosecution_**.” \[Emphasis added.\]”

### First Charge –Pushing and Slapping Incident

49     It was the case for the Defence that the Prosecution had relied mainly on the testimonies of PW5 and PW2 for the incident. It was submitted that there were several material inconsistencies in the evidence led by the Prosecution that cast serious reasonable doubt on this charge.

#### Allegation of Pushing

50     It was highlighted that in the first tranche of the hearing, PW5 had stated during her examination-in-chief that she injured her knee as she was escaping from the accused. Despite several questions by the Prosecution to PW5 on how her knee was injured, she had stuck by her version that she bumped her knee into the wall as she was escaping. During her cross-examination at the first tranche of hearing, she had maintained that her knee was injured due to her escaping and she injured herself and it was not due to the accused pushing her. It was submitted that in terms of her physical injuries, PW5 had alleged that the accused had slapped her only on the left side of her face and nothing else. During her re-examination, the Prosecution had focused the questions on PW5’s injury to her knee again but she again maintained she injured it when she escaped. She again did not complain that the accused had pushed her and it was clear her knee injury had nothing to do with the accused pushing her.

51     It was the the case for the Defence that at the first tranche of the hearing, the Prosecution was fully aware that PW5 had not testified that the accused had pushed her as alleged in the First Charge and PW5 flatly contradicted what she had claimed in her police statements. Yet the Prosecution did not make any application to refer to PW5’s police statements as part of the Prosecution’s case and only provided copies of such statements to the Defence after the Defence highlighted the _Kadar_ principles. It was submitted that not only did PW5 not say that her knee was injured due to the accused pushing her, she gave conflicting evidence on whether her left or right knee was injured.

#### Medical Evidence

52     It was further submitted that the medical evidence on which side of PW5’s knee was also contradictory and most unsatisfactory. In page 2 of _Exhibit P14_, the CGH doctor Dr Watarakapeli Adikaram recorded an abrasion over the left knee but in page 3 of _Exhibit P15_, the abrasion was documented by the same doctor to be at the right knee i.e. right tibial tuberosity. As this doctor was not called to Court to testify, these conflicting records cannot resolve the conflicting accounts of PW5. It was the case for the Defence that in any case, the medical evidence did not lend any support that it was the accused who had pushed PW5 as it was entirely plausible that PW5 hurt her knee herself as she was running away as she insisted at the first tranche of hearing.

#### Allegation of Slapping

53     It was the case for the Defence that in the first tranche of the hearing, PW5 and PW2 had claimed that the accused slapped PW5 on only one side of her face. Inconsistently, PW5 had alleged she was slapped only the left side of her face while PW2 claimed that PW5 was slapped only the right side of her face. It was submitted that the Prosecution did not take any efforts to resolve the inconsistencies during the examination-in-chief of these witnesses such as referring to their previous statements. According to the Defence, one can only surmise that PW2 had also stated in her police statement that PW5 was only slapped on the right side of her face by the accused since the Prosecution did not seek to substitute PW2’s court testimony evidence with her police statement. It was highlighted that according to PW2, the alleged slap was “not hard”.

54     It was highlighted that during the first tranche of the hearing, PW5 had uniformly insisted that she was only slapped on the left side of her face despite several questions by both the Prosecution and Defence if she was slapped on both sides of her face When PW5 was reminded by the Defence that she told the doctor at CGH that she was slapped on both sides of her face, she had disputed it. She had insisted that she was slapped only on the left side and that she remembers telling the doctor that she was slapped only on her left side and she felt pain over her left cheek.

#### Medical Records

55     It was submitted that the medical records for PW5 showed that she gave inconsistent accounts on the alleged slapping incident:

> (a)     At CGH on 28 February 2018, she stated that she “was slapped over both cheeks multiple times”, “has pain over both cheeks” and has left ear pain too;

> (b) At Marine Polyclinic on 7 March 2018, she only said she was slapped over the left side of her face and did not mention she was slapped on the right side;

> (c) At SGH on 19 March 2018, she yet said she was slapped on both sides of her face and she felt pain in both her left and right ears, although her left ear was more painful.

It was submitted that PW5 had provided material inconsistent accounts to the doctors on the alleged slapping.

56     It was the case for the Defence that the CGH medical report was made by PW3 who did not examine PW5. He was only able to rely only on another doctor’s (Dr Watarakapeli Pradeep) unsatisfactory records which was shown to contain conflicting records namely:

> (a)     PW3 accepted that while Dr Pradeep recorded it as “right tibial tuberosity” in _Exhibit P15_, he recorded it inconsistently as “left tibial tuberosity” in _Exhibit P14;_

> (b)     PW3 agreed that it was strange for Dr Pradeep to use the term “Likely contusion” in _Exhibit P14_ as the bruise should be either there or not there. It was not a terms that PW3 himself would use;

> (c)     PW3 could not explain why Dr Pradeep had indicated in _Exhibit P15_ that an injury was self inflicted and later made the correction;

> (d) PW3 was unable to say if Dr Pradeep used an otoscope to examine PW5’s ear drum and was yet unable to see them. He has also not experienced not being able to see the ear drum of any patient ever in the A&E department;

> (e)     PW3 agreed that it was unsatisfactory that Dr Pradeep was not present in Court to explain his records;

> (f)     PW3 agreed that there was a distinction as to whether a patient complained that she was slapped on the cheeks or on the ears.

#### PW4’s evidence

57     It was submitted that the Prosecution appeared to rely on the tenuous statement of PW4 that he saw PW5 “holding onto the ear” as evidence that she must have been slapped. The fact remains that he did not witness any slap and could have been affected by him hearing claims by the others that PW5 was slapped. It was further submitted that PW5 did not testify she held her ear and there may be a variety of reasons why she held her ear other than because it felt painful. Given this shaky state of testimony, it was submitted that little weight should be given to his testimony.

58     According to the Defence, PW4’s account of the events appeared to be also affected by what he heard from others than what he actually witnessed. For example, he had testified that he thought PW1 had tried to stop the accused’s car although he did not witness it but based on what he was told by PW1.

59     It was submitted that it was also not explained why PW5 did not attend to the ENT specialist referral to CGH as testified by PW3. It was the case for the Defence that this calls into question the veracity of her claim that she had sustained loss of hearing by not attending the follow-up referral to CGH.

#### Further Cross-examination of PW5

60     It was highlighted at the start of the second tranche of hearing, PW5 was given a chance to correct any of the testimony she had provided at the first tranche of hearing. She clarified an insignificant fact which did not involve where she was slapped on her face or whether the accused had pushed her. She maintained that the accused did not push her and that she was slapped only on the left side of her face by the accused.

61     It was the case for the Defence that when she was confronted with her inconsistent police statements, she was obviously shaken at the witness box and gave answers that showed she was not a credible and truthful witness:

> (a) Her immediate answer was that she denied that her police statement stated that the accused pushed her and injured her knee;

> (b) When PW5 was then shown her police statement marked _Exhibit D5_, she evasively claimed that she could not remember if she signed on the statement and that she is in “trauma already”;

> (c)     When PW5 read _Exhibit D5_ as recording that she told the police that the accused pushed her and caused her to injure her knee, she immediately claimed that this fact was correct;

> (d)     However, when she was asked which of her account to the police or to the Court was true, she then evaded the question by claiming she “can’t remember”;

> (e)     A few questions further, PW5 then changed her position and said the police statement was correct in that the accused pushed her. She sought to explain that she was confused due to how the Defence had questioned her at the first tranche of hearing;

> (f)     After further cross-examination, PW5 changed her testimony again and said she cannot remember if the accused pushed her;

> (g)     After PW5 was next shown a second police statement recorded from her where it stated that the accused had pushed her, she took a long time to consider before saying that she remembered already and that the accused really pushed her and that was her final answer;

> (h)     When asked why she had not said the accused pushed her in the first tranche of hearing, she incredibly explained that “Because when you are inside the Court, you almost forgot everything.”

62     It was submitted that PW5 had said she remembered telling the doctors at Marine Parade Polyclinic and SGH on which side of her face she was slapped. She tried to explain that she did not tell the doctor at Marine Parade Polyclinic that she was slapped on the right side as she only felt pain in the left ear. It was the case for the Defence that this was materially inconsistent with what she told the doctor at SGH whereby she said she felt pain in both ears and she was slapped on both sides. It was highlighted that she even remembered telling the doctor at SGH that the pain at the right side was not as painful as the left side. She went on to inconsistently said she did not mention the slapping of the right side as it was like “nothing”. It was submitted that PW5’s clear recollection of what she told the doctors at Marine Parade Polyclinic and SGH (more than one year ago in 2018) showed that she is certainly not a forgetful person as she claimed herself to be.

63     It was the case for the Defence that this was a textbook example of an untruthful and unreliable witness who can twist and turn when she was caught giving materially inconsistent allegations. It was submitted that there was no sign that PW5 appeared to be forgetful or traumatised at the first tranche of hearing and she appeared to be composed in her testimony. There was no reason for her to be in a trauma. She was the alleged victim and not the one facing a serious criminal charge. According to the Defence, her claim that she was at trauma was unbelievable. On such a significant multiple slapping incident in which she no less claimed to be experienced for the first time in her life, it begs belief that she would remember wrongly that she was not slapped on both sides of her face if that was true.

64     Further, she had resolutely insisted that she was not pushed or slapped on the right side despite being reminded that she was recorded to have told the CGH doctor so. It was the case for the Defence that it was not open for the Prosecution to submit that the inconsistencies in PW5’s evidence are not material or insignificant. It was submitted that the Prosecution had fully accepted that the inconsistent police statements would tend to undermine the Prosecution’s case and strengthen the Defence’s case before agreeing to release the police statements to the Defence.

65     It was highlighted that in re-examination, the Prosecution had curiously asked PW5 between the Court version and the police statement version, “which one should we prefer? Which one is true?” and PW5 answered:

> A:    Uh, in the police because in police, if you are reporting, uh, false report is, uh, against the law.”

It was submitted that it was clear that PW5 chose the police statement version because she was fearful she would be breaking the law if she said the report to the police was false. According to the Defence, this was a person who did not care about the truth but more concerned if she may get into trouble for giving a false police statement.

66     It was further submitted that PW5 was also caught shifting her accounts as to why her court testimony and police statements on whether both sides of her face were slapped. She first claimed she could not remember before saying her police statements were correct before claiming again she could not remember and then finally settling her answer that the police statements were correct. These shifts and turns showed PW5 was not telling the truth and was merely rationalizing which position was more defensible. She rationalized that keeping to the police statements be more defensible since they were made closer in time to the date of the alleged slapping incident. This was not a witness of truth but a witness who is trying to concoct her evidence based on what she believes the Court will accept. Otherwise, she would not be vacillating in her evidence.

67     It was the case for the Defence that it was regretful that the Prosecution had downplayed the material inconsistencies as “a bit inaccurate”. Whether the accused had pushed PW5 or slapped her on her right side of her face are crucial actus reas elements of the First Charge. These acts could not be simply dismissed as forgettable actions of an alleged victim. They cast very severe doubts on the credibility of PW5 as the Prosecution’s main witness.

68     According to the Defence, it was not open for the Prosecution to submit that PW5’s police statements are more reliable than her court testimony and excuse her for the material inconsistencies. Taking such a position would make the court trial pointless and an accused person can simply be convicted on the complainant’s police statement even though the complainant’s court testimonies are materially incongruent. The Prosecution had stated firmly that they are not applying to substitute PW5’s police statement with what she had testified in Court. This meant the Prosecution was still relying on PW5’s court testimony and yet expect this Court to find that there was no reasonable doubt despite the obvious material inconsistencies in her evidence.

#### Medical Evidence on the Slapping Incident

69     It was submitted the maker of the CGH reports at _Exhibit P14_ and _Exhibit P15_ i.e. Dr Watarakapeli Adikaram, a doctor who was assigned to the A&E Department of CGH for about 2 months before 28 February 2018 was not available. According to the Defence, this casted doubts if the slapping occurred. In page 3 of _Exhibit P14_, the said doctor stated “_likely contusion of the L cheek and L TMJ area and neck after assault_”. This was agreed by PW3 that it was a strange term to use because a contusion is either there or it is not there. It was the case for the Defence that there was no objective evidence that the slap occurred.

70     It was highlighted that there was also no objective medical evidence that the tympanic membrane of PW5’s left ear was damaged. Dr Watarakapeli Adikaram could not see the said tympanic membrane and the doctors at the Marine Parade Polyclinic, PW11 and PW8 confirmed that the said tympanic membrane was intact. It was submitted that while the audiometry tests at SGH showed that there was a mild low frequency hearing loss in PW5’s left ear, it did not mean that this was caused by the alleged slapping by the accused. If there was any hearing loss, it could be a pre-existing condition or faked by PW5 to have suffered it due to the alleged slapping by the accused.

71     It was highlighted that according to the Prosecution’s ENT specialist PW3, PW5’s hearing loss was a sensorineural hearing loss. PW3 became an ENT specialist since August 2017, which was 8 months before she examined PW5. The Defence called a highly experienced ENT specialist DW3 to provide an independent opinion. DW3 had been an ENT specialist for 17 years and had opined that there were doubts on PW5’s claim of hearing loss from trauma to her left ear if she was slapped at her left cheek or her left ear.

72     It was submitted that the Prosecution seemed to suggest that PW5 had suffered damage to the tympanic membrane but it was not seen due to the inexperience of the CGH doctor. It was the case for the Defence that such a suggestion is completely speculative and the Prosecution was inviting this Court to decide a doubt in favour of the Prosecution when it was at more reasonably likely that there was no such damage to the tympanic membrane although the CGH doctor did not manage to see PW5’s tympanic membrane. According to the reports from the Marine Parade Polyclinic and SGH, the ear canals were normal with no blood or discharge. It was submitted that there was simply no evidence that there was any damage caused to the tympanic membrane.

73     It was highlighted that the Prosecution had sought to show that if PW5 was truthful in reporting that she had decreased hearing acuity, the hearing evaluation test supports that PW5 suffered a left sensorineural hearing loss. It was the case for the Defence that this missed the point since even if PW5 did suffer a left sensorineural hearing loss, it did not prove that any such loss was due to the alleged slapping by the accused since DW3 had opined it was highly unlikely due to be so from the records. Although the Prosecution considered calling rebuttal evidence against DW3’s opinion, they decided not to do so and thus accepted his opinion. This was after Prosecution suggesting in vain to DW3 that multiple hard slaps may have caused left sensorineural hearing loss for PW5’s case.

74     It was the case for the Defence that given the serious allegation in a criminal charge, it was regretful that an objective test of Otoacoustic Emission (costing $80 in a Government hospital like SGH and taking place in 20 to 30 seconds) was not conducted. It is also regretful that PW5 declined to be interviewed or examined by DW3 as explained by him. It was submitted that the SGH medical report by PW8 was also just a provisional diagnosis of inner ear concussion and she had wanted to repeat the hearing test in 3 months’ time. This was similar to DW3’s opinion that the test should be repeated. However, PW5 did not turn up for a repeat test and there was reasonable doubt if her attending to a repeat test would reveal a different diagnosis by PW8 since it was never carried out.

### Second Charge – Kicking and Biting Incident

75     It was the case for the Defence that the accused does not deny kicking and biting her own father (PW4). However, it was submitted that the hurt caused to PW4 was on grave and sudden provocation under section 334 of the Penal Code.

76     It was further submitted that PW4 was an unsatisfactory witness given his state of dementia. According to him, he did not see the accused slapping PW5. It was highlighted that initially, he claimed he was trying to prevent the accused from hitting PW5. Later, he said he cannot remember what happened and that he did not know actually what happened. He then claimed that while the accused and PW5 were involved in a commotion or fighting, he was trying to stop it by pushing them apart. He said he could not remember how the accused responded and then later said the accused bit his arm in response when the Prosecution asked when the accused had bit him. It was submitted that PW4’s evidence had vacillated several times during examination-in-chief and showed that his evidence was wholly unreliable.

77     It was the case for the Defence that during his examination-in-chief, PW4 did not mention that he had tried to hit the accused before she kicked him. When cross-examined, he said he did not remember that. It was submitted that during examination-in-chief, PW4 also did not mention that he picked up a chair and wanted to throw it at the accused. When cross-examined though, PW4 had conceded that happened although he tried to claim he could not remember it.

78     It was the case for the Defence that the accused’s consistent version of events was preferred. She had explained that PW4 had quarreled with the accused after he was woken up due to the accused’s scolding of PW5. It was submitted that in the course of the quarrel, PW4 had raised his hand and wanted to hit the accused. In reaction, she kicked him out of impulse. According to the Defence, PW4 did not completely fall on his backside as the accused held him. After PW4 stood up, he lifted a chair and wanted to throw it at the accused. She then held the chair to prevent PW4 from throwing it in fear that a thrown chair will injure PW2 and he then interlocked the accused’s left hand.

79     It was submitted that despite his age, PW4 is a strong man and according to the medical report of PW9 who opined that PW4’s “upper and lower limbs revealed power of 5”. It was further submitted that the accused had asked him to let her go and she warned him she would bite him if he did not stop. As he did not stop, she placed her teeth onto his arm and the shock caused PW4 to release her.

80     It was the case for the Defence that the medical report for PW4 was completely at odds with the exaggerated version related by PW5 and this embellished account further affected the credibility of PW5 as a witness. It was submitted that in Court testimony, she had claimed that the accused had pushed PW4 causing him to fall and bump his head against the door. When PW4 was on the floor, the accused then kicked him hard at his upper chest and stomach once as he was in a bent position.

81     It was highlighted that PW5’s police statement was different. She had told the police on 28 February 2018 that the accused had kicked PW4 on his stomach causing him to fall and hitting his head on the door. However, in a further police statement recorded on 13 March 2018, PW5 gave the version that was similar to her court testimony that the accused had pushed PW4 causing his head to “bang to the bedroom door”. It was submitted that according to PW1, PW5 told him PW4 “got whacked by a chair”. While this was not repeated by PW5 in Court, it showed that she is a person prone to embellishment. It was highlighted that notably, the Prosecution did not rely on PW5’s version in putting their case to the accused during cross-examination so it would appear that the Prosecution disagreed with PW5’s claim that the accused had pushed PW4 causing him to hit his head as he fell down.

82     It was the case for the Defence that the medical report for PW4 was consistent with the accused’s account:

> (a)    “Examination of the head and face revealed no injuries”. This put paid to PW5’s unsubstantiated claim that PW4’s head knocked the door as he fell. PW9 had confirmed that there was no head injury;

> (b)    “Abdomen was soft and mild tenderness was noted over the right side upper abdomen.” This showed that the kick was not heavy and any injury suffered by PW4 was minor;

> (c)    “There was 4 cm diameter circular erythema noted over the left forearm, possible bite mark, with bluish discoloration surrounding it.” This showed that the accused did not bite hard but just placed her teeth on PW4’s arm to shock him into releasing her from his interlock. PW9 had testified that it would be easier for bruises to manifest in an elderly person.

83     It was the case for the Defence that the accused had exercised her right of private defence under section 96 of the Penal Code when she kicked PW4 to fend off his attempt to hit her and when she bit PW4 to free herself from him interlocking her. Alternatively, it was submitted that the accused should at worst be held guilty for an offence under section 334 of the Penal Code for causing hurt on grave and sudden provocation by PW4.

84     It was submitted that the two distinct elements of the test for determining whether an accused acted under grave and sudden provocation at the material time are, first, the subjective requirement that the accused was at that time deprived of his self-control by provocation and second, the objective requirement that the provocation was grave and sudden. (see _Mohammed Ali bin Johari v PP_ \[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 105870 at \[90\]–\[102\] and _PP v Kwan Cin Cheng_ \[1998\] 1 SLR(R) 43471 at \[44\]).

85     It was submitted that in the present case, the two distinct elements of the test were satisfied. When PW4 raised his hand to strike the accused, she had lost self-control and her reflex action was to kick PW4 to defend herself. It was further submitted that objectively, the threatening gesture by PW4 was also grave and sudden. It instinctively led to the accused’s light kick to fend his attack. It was the case for the Defence that subsequently, PW4’s act of attempting to throw a chair and interlocking the accused’s left arm also constituted grave and sudden provocation that led to her placing her teeth on PW4’s arm to stop his aggressive acts which may injure both her and PW2. In the heat of the moment of a fight between PW4 and the accused, her response was not disproportionate as reflected in the minor injuries sustained by PW4. If the accused had deliberate intent to cause hurt to PW4, his injuries would not be as minor.

## Third Charge –Throwing Handphone into Washing Machine

86     It was the case for the Defence that the only witness who claimed to have seen the accused throw PW5’s handphone into the washing machine was PW2 who suffered from dementia as affirmed by their children, PW1 and the accused, who mentioned it at several times during their testimony.

87     It was submitted that DW2 was an unsatisfactory witness whose testimony was fraught with inconsistencies:

> (a)     Initially, she had stated that the accused stayed for a “Very little, short while” and did nothing else and touched nothing before leaving. After several prompting by the Prosecution through questions if the accused had touched anything, referring PW2 to the fact she had given a police statement, if PW5 had a handphone and if the accused “go into the kitchen”, PW2 then stated that the accused had thrown PW5’s handphone into the washing machine which was dry then;

> (b)     PW2 claimed that the accused took PW5’s handphone which was on her table in the hall before throwing it into the washing machine. According to PW5, her handphone was left on a steel kitchen cabinet instead;

> (c)     PW2 had claimed that she asked PW5 to pick up the handphone from the washing machine when she returned to the flat. It was submitted that she did not see the handphone inside the washing machine with her own eyes. This was different from PW5’s testimony who said she did not pick her handphone from the washing machine as it was no longer in the washing machine when she returned to the flat. According to her, it was on top of the washing machine as PW2 claimed she had picked it from the washing machine.

88     It was the case for the Defence that PW2 also remembered significant facts which were clearly wrong or inaccurate. For example, she stated that PW4 did not leave the flat that night. It was also curious that the IO stated that PW2 was not willing to speak to the IO regarding PW5’s phone on the day of the incident. It was submitted that such reluctance cast suspicion on the veracity of her claim that the accused had placed PW5’s phone in the washing machine. It was further submitted that given her dementia state, a police statement was only recorded at a much later time on 13 March 2018 when PW1, PW2, PW4 and PW5 were all called down to be interviewed. This cast doubts on the accuracy of PW2’s account especially when she was unwilling on 28 February 2018.

89     It was submitted that in any event, there was no objective evidence that the handphone was damaged on that night. No repair was done to the handphone and no photo was taken of the handphone that night or soon after to prove the condition of the handphone. When the IO saw PW5’s handphone on 13 March 2018, she observed that there was nothing wrong with the handphone and “the phone was okay already”. It was further submitted that it was based entirely on what PW5 had claimed to be lesser condition of her handphone. Even taking the Prosecution’s case at the highest, no real quantifiable damage was established for the said handphone.

### Fourth Charge – Driving into PW1

90     It was the case for the Defence that the Prosecution relied on the testimonies of PW1 and PW5 for the fourth charge. It was submitted that it was important to note that the Prosecution did not craft this charge on the basis that the accused’s car hit PW1’s right knee so the Prosecution takes a highly ambiguous position if they stuck by the PW1’s version in Court that his right knee was hit by the accused’s car. According to the Defence, the Prosecution had to make up their mind and cannot leave such a material element vague as to how PW1’s right knee was injured.

91     It was submitted that according to PW1, he had chased after the accused when he saw her at the block of the flats. Before he could reach the accused’s car, she had locked herself in her car. He then knocked her car window once before he stood in front of her car. The accused accelerated the car and although he stood very close (about 30 centimetres) to the car, he reacted soon enough when the car moved by jumping onto the bonnet. He then rolled off the car and stood on his own feet after rolling off. He did not realise his right knee was hit by the car until he himself drove later to Changi Hospital and he felt slight pain.

92     It was further submitted that PW1 had described the incident as it was “in the movies” but PW1 was not a stuntman but a 100kg heavy person. It was the case for the Defence that PW1’s complaint was incredible and unsupported by the objective evidence:

> (a)     It was unbelievable that PW1 could humanly react in lightning speed when he was standing at such close proximity from the accused’s car to jump onto the car bonnet when the car was accelerating at high speed towards him;

> (b)     It is equally unbelievable that PW1 could simply roll over the bonnet and land on his feet when he fell off a speeding car;

> (c)     PW1 had claimed that despite the car hitting him at such high acceleration, he did not notice that his right leg was hit and that he realized he was hit at a later time when he drove to CGH. Given such a dramatic collision of the car onto PW1, it was unbelievable that there was no trace of any bruise or scratch on PW1. There was also no scratch or bruise on the part of his body that landed on the car. Although PW1 conceded that there was no visible bruise or scratch, he claimed without any medical basis that his knee could still have a bruise as “It was hit, there could be internal, I can’t know.”

> (d)     the medical report for PW1 did not state that he was hit by a car. It said instead that “He presented with a painful knee after jumping onto the bonnet of a car, and rolled off”. It was submitted that curiously, the Prosecution did not adduce the detailed A&E records unlike what was done so for the CGH medical records for PW5 and PW1 to show what was the detailed complaint made by PW1 to Changi Hospital;

> (e)     the police could have but failed to inspect the car in question despite the request by the accused to do so. It was submitted that the IO gave a strange reason that the car was not inspected as there was no allegation to the damage of the car. Therefore, the IO was wholly unaware of the even the make and model of the car in question. If the 100kg frame of PW1 landed and rolled onto the bonnet, it would have caused at least a dent on the car. The police was remiss in failing to inspect the car as that objective evidence would go a long way in proving that the incident could not have taken place since the bonnet of the accused’s car was smooth and spotless after the incident. Through the unchallenged testimony of the accused, the photograph of the car showed that that it was exactly the same state at the time the photo was taken and 28 February 2018.

93     It was submitted that PW1 claimed he had only knocked once on the accused’s car window and this was supported by PW5 initially. However, when confronted with her police statement, PW5 finally changed her testimony and reluctantly conceded that through her own knocking action before attempting to give spurious reasons why she initially said it was once. It was further submitted that the accused’s defence that it was PW1 who punched her window violently many times that caused her to drive away. She was certain that PW1 was not in front of her when she drove away. It was the case for the Defence that her account was consistent and unshaken during cross-examination.

### Complex Interlinked Relationships in the Present Case

94     It was the case for the Defence that a proper appreciation of the four charges cannot be devoid of the long history of relations between the accused and the Prosecution’s witnesses PW1, PW2, PW4 and PW5. Despite being siblings, it was submitted that PW1 clearly had an axe to grind against the accused.

95     According to the defence, PW1 was unhappy with the accused over an ang pao incident during their father’s 80th birthday, he was unhappy with the accused not allowing her Myanmese maid Myint Myint Htay (“Myint”) to be at her parents’ place when PW1 was there. It was submitted that PW1 went to the extent of bringing Myint to the Ministry of Manpower twice without her consent to file complaints against the accused for ill-treatment. He also made a police report that the accused had threatened PW5.

96     It was further submitted that there was also other unhappiness including PW1’s accusation that the accused was mismanaging PW2’s pension and her refusal to hand up PW2’s NRIC to him. It was highlighted that this was not the first police case involving PW1 and the accused. As recent as November 2017, the accused had called the police as they had a quarrel over whether Myint should remain in their parents’ flat or return to the accused’s flat. It was submitted that regretfully, the Defence was unable to locate Myint (who was in Singapore during the trial but a reluctant witness) and call her as a witness for the trial.

97     It was the case for the Defence that within a short span that PW5 re-started work on 15 February 2018 to the charges on 28 February 2018, she had developed a fraught relationship with the accused to the extent that she filed a police report against the accused for threatening to slap her. It was submitted that whatever the merits of each of their position, it was clear that PW5 was unhappy with how the accused had scolded her for the way she treated her parents, including manipulating them, the way PW5 held PW2, the amount of rice that PW5 gave PW1, whether PW5 had lied in going to MOM for her thumbprints etc. It was further submitted that PW5 had admitted that after the Jumbo incident (which was about 1 week before 28 February 2018), she did not want to accompany the accused’s parents whenever the accused wanted to bring them. According to the Defence, this showed she bore grudges towards the accused since the Jumbo incident.

98     It was submitted that given the close relationship between PW1 and PW5 (which is closer than one between PW1 and Myint), it was not difficult to imagine that they would concoct false allegations against the accused to get her into trouble. As for PW2 and PW4, it was further submitted that they are elderly witnesses suffering with dementia. Their accounts are unsteady and unreliable to serve as evidence for conviction for the four charges. As they now rely solely on the care of PW1 and PW5, the accused had explained that PW2 may feel threatened and PW4 may have been manipulated to give evidence in favour of PW1 and PW5’s wishes to see the accused convicted. As PW2 was no longer able to walk unaided by her court testimony, she was wholly dependent on PW5. Being vulnerable, it was the case for the Defence that she was highly susceptible to manipulation by PW5.

99     According to the Defence, it was shown that an elderly person like PW2 and PW4 was susceptible to be manipulated by their primary caregiver PW5. As shown by the accused’s proposed lunch with her parents on 28 February 2018, PW1 was excited to attend but he immediately changed his mind after PW5 influenced him not to do so. It was submitted that similar manipulation was also exercised over PW2 according to the uncontroverted testimony of the accused.

### Low Weight on One Answer by the Defendant in Exhibit P19

100    It was submitted that the Prosecution had placed great reliance on the accused’s statement at _Exhibit P19_ for answering that she “do not remember” in response to a question if she placed PW5’s handphone in the washing machine. It was the case for the Defence that it was highly ironic that the Prosecution gave heavy reliance on just one apparent weakness in the accused’s statement in comparison with the numerous discrepancies in PW5’s police statements which the Prosecution appears to be downplaying as minor inaccuracies.

101    It was submitted that the accused had explained that her answer was in the context of explaining that she could not remember if PW5 had a handphone. The Prosecution argued that it was a Yes and No question and this conceded that the answer by the accused was a non-answer. It was further submitted that the IO could have clarified why the accused had given that answer and failed to do so. It is submitted that it should therefore be not in order for the Prosecution to rely on such a non-answer to convict the accused. Even if the Court finds that there was a slight discrepancy or flaw in the accused’s evidence, it was submitted that it does not make up for the deficiencies in the Prosecution’s case as the onus is not on the accused to prove her innocence.

## F.   Prosecution’s Reply

## I.   The VCH charge against PW5

102    In response to the submissions by the Defence, it was highlighted that the three main grounds to argue that there was reasonable doubt were:

> (a)     There was contradictory evidence on which knee was injured (**“first ground**”);

> (b)     PW5 had testified at the first tranche that her knee injury was sustained in the course of escaping, and that the accused only slapped her on one side of the face. Her response when confronted with her police statements showed that she is not honest. Having disclosed PW5’s statements, it was not open to the Prosecution to argue that the inconsistencies in PW5’s court testimony and the statements are not material or insignificant. PW5’s ultimate position that the accounts in her police statement should be preferred was not credible. It is not open for the Prosecution to submit that PW5’s police statements are more reliable than her court testimony (**“second ground**”);

> (c)     There is no evidence of PW5 sustaining tympanic membrane damage. DW3’s testimony – that it is highly unlikely to suffer sensorineural hearing loss without such injury – should be accepted. (“**third ground**”).

## A.   Response to First Ground

103    It was submitted that photograph _Exhibit P11_ showed, without doubt, a knee injury on PW5. Judging from the curvature and placement of both legs (the injured leg being front facing with another leg behind), it is clear that the injured knee was the _right_ knee. It was the Prosecution’s case that this was a clear inference that can be drawn from the exhibit, without need for external corroboration, and independent of:

> (a)     Whether PW5 _remembered_ it as being the right or left knee; and

> (b)     The fact that Dr Watarakapeli Adikaram erroneously recorded injury to different knees in _Exhibit P14_ and _Exhibit P15_.

## B.   Response to Second Ground

104    It was the Prosecution’s case that the second ground had been addressed in the Prosecution’s Closing Submissions at \[6\]-\[12\]. To add on, it was submitted that the Prosecution accepts that there are discrepancies between PW5 _initial_ court testimony and her police statements which _could_ undermine the Prosecution’s case or strengthen the accused’s case.

105    The key question is whether there were innocent explanations for the discrepancies, or whether the discrepancies necessarily mean that PW5 is a dishonest and untrustworthy witness out to embellish and frame the accused. It was submitted that PW5 gave perfectly reasonable and commonsensical explanations as to why the account in her police statements should be preferred, such as the passage of time, and that she was more focused on the injury to her left ear to the neglect of the right (which explanations Counsel conveniently ignores in the Defence’s Closing Submission at \[28\]-\[29\]). It was further submitted that PW5’s honest (at times naïve) demeanor in court was testament to her credibility.

106    It was submitted that ultimately, PW5’s court testimony in the first tranche and her police statements _both incriminate the accused_, only to different degrees. If PW5 was a dishonest witness out to embellish her evidence to frame the accused, it makes no sense that she would recount in court a version that _incriminates the accused to a lesser extent_.

107    It was further submitted that the only reasonable explanations for PW5’s change in evidence were innocent ones as per PW5’s clarifications. Given this, the discrepancies between PW5’s initial court testimony and police statements do not _in fact_ undermine the Prosecution’s case or strengthen the Defence’s case. Accordingly, there is no reason why this Court cannot accept (or that the Prosecution was barred from urging the court to accept) PW5’s account in her police statements.

## C.   Response to Third Ground

108    It was the Prosecution’s case that the Defence’s Closing Submissions contained no arguments that PW5 did not in fact suffer from a mild low frequency hearing loss that is sensorineural in nature. It was submitted that the arguments pertained solely to the issue of causation and highlights the absence of evidence showing tympanic membrane damage.

109    It was further submitted that the Prosecution had highlighted at \[24(d)\] of the Prosecution’s Closing Submissions how it was inaccurate to conclude factually that there _was no injury_ to PW5’s tympanic membrane. The Defence therefore had no basis to submit that “there was no such damage.” at \[39\] of its Closing Submissions.

110    It was the Prosecution’s case that the Defence had also mischaracterised DW3’s evidence at \[40\] of its Closing Submissions. DW3 did not testify _categorically_ that it was highly unlikely to suffer sensorineural hearing loss from multiple hard slaps – his evidence was that this was unlikely in the specific context when one “_…present that way with the injuries and the reported injuries at the Emergency Department at the following---polyclinic_”. It was submitted that clearly, DW3 was again alluding to the (seeming) absence of tympanic membrane damage. The evidence was silent on whether PW5 did suffer any tympanic membrane damage. Thus, DW3’s testimony on this point was simply **neutral**.

111    It was submitted that in the circumstances, the Court has to turn to the other evidence to determine whether PW5’s sensorineural hearing loss was caused by the accused’s slaps. In this regard, it bears highlighting that:

> (a)     There is no reason to doubt PW5’s account that she sustained hearing loss _after being slapped;_

> (b)      _Exhibit P7_ reflected that the hearing loss had _improved_ from 28 February 2018 to 19 March 2018, in line with the medical evidence that sensorineural hearing loss can self-resolve in about one month. This supports the inference that the loss was _caused_ on 28 February 2018.

## II. The VCH Charge Against PW4

112    The Defence’s Closing Submissions claimed that the accused was acting in private defence under s 96 of the Penal Code or, alternatively, under grave and sudden provocation such that a conviction under s 334 would be more appropriate. It was the Prosecution’s case that this is untenable:

> (a)     Private defence under s 96 of the Penal Code was not made out on the facts as the restriction under s 99(3) apply. There was clearly time to have recourse to the protection of the public authorities. In any event, at its highest, the Defence’s case is that PW4 _attempted_ to throw a chair and interlocked her arms. The accused’s acts of biting him clearly inflicted more harm than necessary for the purpose of defence, within the meaning of s 99(4) of the Penal Code, such that the right of private defence no longer applies. The defence has no basis to submit at \[50(c)\] that PW4’s 4 cm erythema showed that the accused did not bite hard but just placed her teeth on PW4’s arm to shock him into releasing her from his interlock.”

> (b)     There was no grave and sudden provocation on the facts. Apart from the accused’s self-serving and dubious claim that her actions were out of “reflex”, there was no evidence to suggest that she had lost self-control. It is also unfathomable how an _attempt_ to throw a chair or having ‘interlocked’ one’s arms constitute grave and sudden provocation, by any standards.

113    It was submitted that neither defence has been proven on a balance of probabilities. The Defence had also highlighted that the absence of head injury put paid to PW5’s unsubstantiated claim that PW4’s head knocked the door as he fell” at \[50(a)\] of its Closing Submission. It was submitted that the Defence was assuming without basis that any impact _must_ result in a discernable injury.

## III.   The Mischief Charge

114    It was submitted that the Defence had highlighted some inconsistencies in PW2’s evidence and PW5’s evidence. The Prosecution accepted that PW2’s evidence does not gel perfectly with PW5’s. However, as explained in the Prosecution’s Closing Submissions, they cohere on the material points.

115    It was the Prosecution’s case that for the accused to be innocent of this charge, _both_ PW5’s and PW2’s evidence must be false. If PW5 was a dishonest witness as regards the mischief charge, it was not reasonably possible that PW2 would just so happen to give corroborating evidence. It is also not reasonably possible that PW5 and PW2 were both _deliberately_ falsely implicating the accused.

## IV.   The Rash Act Charge

116    It was the Prosecution’s case that the Defence made several speculative submissions at \[63\] on why, as a matter of physics, PW1’s account was not believable. It was submitted that these are entirely without basis and do not undermine PW1’s evidence in any way.

117    As regarding how many times PW1 knocked the accused’s car - _even if_ PW1 had knocked on the accused’s car window more than once, it does not change the fact that the accused was not fearing for her life as she claimed. This was clear from her subsequent omission to seek help from passing police officers, and her opening the car window to laugh.

## V.   Concluding Remarks

118    It was submitted that the Defence had focused on ostensible deficiencies and inconsistencies in the witnesses’ evidence. However, on a careful scrutiny of the evidence in the proper context, it was clear that the witnesses’ testimonies (especially PW5’s) remained credible and remain incriminatory. Moreover, the presence of some discrepancies across various witnesses’ testimonies points _against_ collusion – which was what the accused had suggested.

## G.   Defence’s Reply

119    In response to the Prosecution’s Closing Submissions, it was submitted that the Prosecution made sweeping submissions to attack the accused although there was bereft of evidence. It was the case for the Defence that the accused had testified earnestly and honestly. No inconsistency was discerned from her testimony by the Prosecution unlike the numerous inconsistencies from the Prosecution’s witnesses.

120    It was submitted that this was an unusual case that cannot be simply rationalised with pure logic given the complex interpersonal and familial relationships between the witnesses and their background. The bad blood that festered before 28 February 2018 was clear from the series of unhappy incidents between PW1, PW5 and the accused. This included police reports that were made by PW5 against the accused prior to 28 February 2018 that the accused was threatening her. Given the close relationship between PW1 and PW5 including the fact that he was her employment sponsor and she shared all her unhappiness about the accused with PW1, it was likely that PW5 would tailor her evidence to suit PW1’s wish to get the accused in trouble.

121    It was further submitted that it was unlike Myint who was not employed by PW1 and who did not agree to PW1’s baseless suggestion that the accused had beaten her. It was the case for the Defence that PW1’s hatred ran deep to the extent that even when he conceded that the accused had not beaten up Myint, he twisted his accusation to another baseless accusation that the accused had definitely abused Myint mentally.

122    It was the case for the Defence that on the other hand, the Prosecution’s stark approach towards the Prosecution’s witnesses was to ignore, downplay or gloss over the several material inconsistencies in the evidence of the Prosecution’s witnesses. To that extent, the Prosecution would even artificially misconstrue some the inconsistencies of the Prosecution’s witness as evidence that buttress the credibility of the witnesses.

## First Charge –Pushing and Slapping Incident

123    It was submitted that the Prosecution had attempted to salvage the completely discredited evidence of PW5 by supporting feeble excuses for her. The excuse that PW5 had forgotten almost everything when she testified in Court or she was in mental block was remarkably unbelievable. It was further submitted that if one accepts such an excuse, what little weight could anyone even afford to all the other aspects of her evidence including evidence that supports the Prosecution’s case? Was the other court evidence uttered by PW5 all untrue and inaccurate given her claim she almost forgot everything in Court and when she was in mental block? The issue of whether the accused had slapped on both sides of PW5’s face and whether she pushed her are not immaterial forms of evidence that a victim (especially one who claimed to have never been slapped before) would forget when she testified in Court. These aspects were the main elements of the First Charge which the Prosecution was duty bound to prove beyond reasonable doubt.

124    It was the case for the Defence that there was no inkling that PW5 appeared to be forgetful or in mental block at the first tranche of the hearing. She answered with a firm manner and did not require time to gather her memories before answering. In contrast, PW5 was obviously shaken when her material inconsistencies were exposed at the second tranche of hearing as she was caught lying and being dishonest.

125    It was submitted that the Prosecution had tried to salvage PW5’s shaken testimony by claiming she was “initially confused” at the second tranche of the hearing. An examination of the transcripts would show how she wavered between excuses of not remembering the true facts and sticking to her police statements before she finally settled on sticking with her police statements as she was worried of the adverse consequences of being found to give false information to the police.

126    It was the case for the Defence that essentially, the Prosecution was curiously submitting that the Court should takes a pick and mix approach towards PW5’s court evidence i.e. accept only those evidence that is in favour of the Prosecution and detrimental to the Defence while rejecting those that is detrimental to the Prosecution and favourable to the Defence. Given the high standard of proving beyond reasonable doubt, the Prosecution’s submissions could easily be rejected outright.

127    It was submitted that the other weak excuse the Prosecution seeks to persuade the Court to accept was that PW5 was focusing only to the left side of her face and she ignored the right side. This was contradictory with the first excuse that she forgot almost everything or was in mental block because if she did not answer that she was slapped on the right side as she was consciously focusing on the left side and ignoring the right side, she could not claim to be forgetful. It was the case for the Defence that the Prosecution had advanced alternative positions without reconciling the strong inconsistencies between the two excuses.

128    It was submitted that the third excuse of the incident been “quite long already” seems to be suggested by the Prosecution that PW5 had forgotten she was slapped on the right side and pushed by the accused due to the long effluxion of time. It was the case for the Defence that this was unbelievable as the time period between the alleged incident on 28 February 2018 and the first tranche of hearing on 22 May 2019 was less than 15 months. It was submitted that it was not open to PW5 to claim she had forgotten because she was reminded during the first tranche of hearing of her allegations to CGH that she was slapped too on the right and pushed by. Despite being pointedly reminded during cross-examination, she insisted on giving inconsistent evidence instead of answering she had forgotten or could not remember

129    It was further submitted that PW5’s excuses cannot be accounted for her poor recollection. During the first tranche of the hearing, she testified that she realised that her knee was bleeding only after she had reached the police station. Given that she was unaware when her knee was injured and only realised at a later time at the police station, she could not now be illogically accusing the accused for pushing her and causing her knee to be injured.

130    According to the Defence if PW5 was telling the truth that the accused had slapped her on both her sides of her face and pushed her, such material facts would not be forgotten by her. What she had likely forgotten was what she had falsely alleged against the accused in her police statements that she was slapped on both sides of her face and that she was pushed. These were highly material reasonable doubts in the Prosecution’s case and cannot be explained away in favour of the Prosecution.

131    With respect to \[13\] of the Prosecution’s Submissions, it was the case for the Defence that it was untrue that PW5’s testimony was corroborated:

> (a)     PW2 inconsistently testified that PW5 was slapped only on the right side of her face. PW2 had also stated inconsistently by claiming that the accused had slapped PW5 in the hall whereas PW5 claimed it happened in the kitchen. PW2 had also stated inconsistently that PW4 had witnessed the accused slapping PW5 when PW5 and PW4 had stated otherwise. Similarly, the Prosecution should not be permitted to take a pick and mix approach towards PW2’s evidence by choosing those that favour the Prosecution’s case while ignoring or downplaying the inconsistencies in her evidence;

> (b)     PW4 did not witness any slapping of PW5 and his impression was likely to be affected by what he was told by PW5 and PW1;

> (c)     While PW10 had taken a photo of PW5’s injured knee, this does not mean that the injury was caused by the accused’s push but more likely due to PW5’s own running as stated by PW5 in the first tranche of the hearing;

> (d)     PW5 had insisted she was slapped only on her left side of her face despite being reminded that she told CGH she was slapped on both sides;

> (e)     PW5’s accounts to different doctors were also materially different. While she told CGH and SGH she was slapped on both sides, she only told Marine Parade Polyclinic she was slapped on the left side.

132    It was submitted that there was no evidence that showed PW5 was not suffering from any loss of hearing at her left ear prior to 28 February 2018. Given the inconsistent nature of her evidence, any mild hearing loss at her left ear may well be pre-existing before 28 February 2018.

133    It was submitted that the Prosecution’s criticism of DW3 was also unwarranted. The main thrust of DW3’s opinion which was unchallenged by the Prosecution during cross-examination or the calling of any rebuttal evidence was that any left sensorineural hearing loss of PW5 was unlikely to be caused by slaps on PW5’s face especially where there was no evidence of injury to PW5’s left ear drum. It was highlighted that the Prosecution conceded this at \[24(d)\] of the Prosecution’s Submissions that “it is not known whether there was any ear injury”. It was further submitted that it would be a quantum leap from such a concession to now argue that it is proven beyond reasonable doubt that there was ear injury in the absence of evidence its existence. If there is no such evidence of injury, it cannot be proven beyond reasonable doubt that it was caused by the accused.

## Second Charge–Kicking and Biting Incident

134    It was submitted that with respect to \[27(b)\] of the Prosecution’s Submissions, PW5’s evidence that the accused had caused PW4’s head to knock onto the bedroom door was unsupported by PW4’s evidence and the objective medical evidence that no injury was sustained by PW4’s head. In another PW5’s and PW4’s embellished accounts, it was falsely alleged that the accused had used a chair to attack PW4. The Defence maintained that the accused had acted out of self-defence and under grave and sudden provocation by PW4.

## Third Charge –Throwing Handphone into Washing Machine

135    With respect to \[36\] of the Prosecution’s Submissions, it was submitted that it cannot be said that PW5’s evidence was consistent with PW2 as only PW2 claimed that she witnessed the accused placing PW5’s phone into the washing machine. PW5 saw no such deed.

136    It was submitted that there was reasonable doubt in PW2’s account as she claimed that it was PW5 who retrieved her handphone from the washing machine whereas PW5 said it was PW2 who did so. Given that PW2 could be mistaken as to the person who retrieved the handphone from the washing machine, it is entirely plausible that she was also mistaken who placed a handphone into the washing machine, if it even did happen at all.

137    It was further submitted that PW2 and PW5 also gave conflicting accounts of the location of PW5’s handphone before it was allegedly placed into the washing machine. PW2 had stated it was on her table while PW5 said it was on her shelves. This cast further reasonable doubt on PW2’s claim. Given her old age and dementia, it cannot be discounted that PW2’s account was mistaken.

138    It was the case for the Defence that PW2’s unchallenged testimony was also that the washing machine was definitely dry then as it was not used for washing. It was accepted by the Prosecution and the Defence that the washing machine was dry at the material time and there was no challenge to PW2’s evidence on this aspect. Therefore, there was no good evidence or reason that PW5’s handphone was damaged even if it was placed into the washing machine in its dry state. It cast reasonable doubt if the handphone was damaged because it was placed into a dry washing machine.

139    It was submitted that with respect to \[40\] of the Prosecution’s Submissions, there does not appear to be any portion of the transcript that supports the Prosecution’s arguments on the accused position. The Defence was simply that the accused had not placed PW5 ’s handphone into the washing machine as she did not even know that PW5 had a handphone. It was further submitted that in any event, there was conflicting account if there was any damage to PW5’s phone since PW10 testified it was fine when she saw it.

## Fourth Charge – Driving into PW1

140    It was highlighted that the Prosecution had claimed that PW1 “suspected that he was hit in the leg”. It was submitted that the word “suspected” was not a word used by PW1 in his testimony. If his knee was indeed hit by the accused’s car, it was unbelievable that such an impact (if true) could not be known to him until some time later when he drove to CGH.

141    It was further submitted that with respect to \[55\] of the Prosecution’s Submissions, it was a red herring on the accused’s non- seeking of help from the police that night. It was a different occasion where she called the police in November 2017 over the issue of whether Myint should go to her flat or remain at her parents’ flat. The accused’s purpose of calling the police then was not to get PW1 in trouble with the law. It was the case for the Defence that the objective evidence showed that the accused had not driven rashly towards PW1 while he was standing in front of her car and the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt was not discharged by the Prosecution.

## Conclusion

142    The accused maintained that the four charges had not been proven beyond reasonable doubt and prayed that the Court acquit her of them.

## H.   Assessment of Evidence

143    The accused had claimed trial to four amended charges involving three victims, namely:

> (i)     two charges of voluntarily causing hurt to PW5 and PW4 respectively under s 323 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.) in **MAC 907035 - 2018** and **MAC 907036 - 2018**;

> (ii)     one charge of mischief involving a handphone belonging to PW5 under s 426 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.) in **MAC 907037 - 2018** and

> (iii)     one charge of causing hurt by doing an act so rashly as to endanger human life involving PW1 in **MAC 907038 - 2018** under s 337(a) of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.).

144    It was clear from the facts before me that the series of events on 28 February 2018 from about 8.30 p.m. onwards at Block 17 Eunos Crescent arose from a background of a strained familial relationship between the accused and her older brother (PW1) as well as the accused’s unhappiness with PW5 over the manner of care of her elderly parents, PW2 and PW4. I was also mindful that the accused’s elderly parents, PW2 and PW4 had dementia but were otherwise present, fairly coherent and alert when giving evidence.

145    In the present case, the main issues before me are as follows:

> (a)     Whether the accused had intentionally caused hurt to PW5, a foreign domestic worker by slapping her face multiple times and pushing her;

> (b)     Whether the accused had intentionally caused hurt to PW4, her own father by kicking his stomach and biting his left forearm;

> (c)     Whether the accused had committed mischief by throwing PW5’s handphone into the washing machine causing damage to the said handphone and

> (d)     Whether the accused had caused hurt by committing a rash act that endangered human life by driving her car forward at PW1, her own brother when he was standing in front of her car and caused him to roll over the bonnet of her car.

146    In my assessment of the evidence, I was mindful that the four charges involving three victims arose soon after the accused came over to her parents’ home on 28 February 2018 at or about 8.30 p.m. to confront and to scold PW5 for keeping PW1 updated on matters relating to the accused’s interaction with her own parents.

147    I noted that according to the Prosecution, this confrontation of PW5 by the accused soon escalated into the commission of three offences that were committed within the confines of a 3-room HDB flat as shown in _Exhibit P13_ and which culminated with the fourth charge at the carpark of Block 17 Eunos Crescent. The accused’s defence to these charges was a bare denial of the first amended charge, the third amended charge as well as the fourth amended charge and her defence that she had acted in self-defence in respect of the second amended charge.

#### (i)   MAC 907035 - 2018 – s 323 Penal Code charge

148    In respect of the first amended charge, it was the Prosecution’s case that the evidence against the accused came from the direct evidence of PW5 that were corroborated by the evidence of PW1, PW2 and the various medical documents reflecting the injuries she suffered from the attack by the accused.

149    It was essentially the Prosecution’s case that the accused had intentionally caused hurt to PW5, a foreign domestic worker by slapping her face multiple times and pushing her. According to the Prosecution, this caused the victim to suffer low frequency hearing loss and multiple contusions. In contrast, the accused claimed that she “never touched” PW5 as she was standing in the dining area and could not have physically reached PW5, who was in the kitchen.

150    In my assessment of the evidence, I was mindful of the discrepancies in PW5’s evidence in relation to whether she was slapped on one or both sides of her face as well as the cause and the location of the injury on her knee. Based on the established jurisprudence, it is clear that a Court should first examine if the discrepancies are actually material. Even if they are, it does not automatically mean that the witness’s evidence should be disregarded in its entirety. Hence, in the present case, I would have to determine whether the discrepancies were material and to weigh these discrepancies against the totality of the evidence before determining whether to accept PW5’s evidence on the key facts in issue.

151    I noted that initially PW5 had testified that on 28 February 2018, she was in the kitchen of the unit at Block 17 Eunos Crescent when the accused rushed into the unit, approached her and slapped her many times on the face. According to her, the accused had slapped her on the left side of her face very forcefully at least twice. After being slapped, PW5 attempted to escape and in the course of doing so, she had bumped her knee onto the wall separating the kitchen from the dining area due to the confined space. Subsequently, after PW5 was recalled and her police statements (disclosed by the Prosecution pursuant to the _Kadar_ disclosure principles) were shown to her by Defence Counsel, PW5 had clarified that the accused had pushed her, causing her knee injury and she had slapped PW5 on both sides of her face. According to PW5, she was sure that whatever she had told the police in her statements were true.

152    It was the Prosecution’s case that PW5 had given cogent, commonsensical and believable reasons for her failure to recount the correct version of events when she first testified. It was submitted that PW5 had consistently relayed to different doctors, on different days, of having been slapped multiple times by the accused. She had also complained on 28 February 2018 of having been pushed. It was also submitted that the medical documents overwhelmingly supported PW5’s refreshed testimony that she was slapped on both sides of the face, sustaining hearing loss as a result, and was pushed against the kitchen doorway sustain a knee abrasion.

153    To explain the discrepancy, the Prosecution had highlighted PW5’s evidence that one would “almost forgot everything” when one was testifying in court and when she was in court, she had “mental block already”. In addition, she had further testified that she just focused only on the left side as she suffered more pain on that side and it had been “quite long already”. According to the Prosecution, PW5 might have been factually erroneous on certain details when she first testified but was not _dishonestly_ so. It was the Prosecution’s case that with the passage of time, her recollection of the incident was no longer perfect. She had confirmed that she had never seen her police statements since giving them in February 2018 and March 2018 until she testified in Court on 10 September 2019, a duration of 1½ years.

154    In contrast, it was the case for the Defence that the discrepancies between the various accounts were highly material and not just minor. It was submitted that the medical records for PW5 showed that she gave inconsistent accounts on the alleged slapping incident. In particular, it was highlighted that at the Marine Parade Polyclinic on 7 March 2018, she had only said she was slapped over the left side of her face and did not mention she was slapped on the right side.

155    I noted that PW11 had testified that the main reason for PW5’s attendance at the Marine Parade Polyclinic was pursuant to the ENT referral for the complaint of pain in her left ear. Hence, the focus of the medical examination would have been to address her complaint of the pain in her left ear. On the facts, I disagreed with the Defence’s position that PW5’s accounts to the different doctors on the slapping incident were _materially_ different. The key issue for the present charge was whether PW5 had been slapped multiple times and pushed by the accused that resulted in a mild low frequency hearing loss and multiple contusions.

156    On the key facts in issue, I was of the view that PW5’s evidence that she had been slapped on both sides of her face had been objectively corroborated by the medical evidence as well as her own police statements namely, _Exhibit D4_ that was recorded on the day of the incident and _Exhibit D6_ that was recorded almost two weeks after the incident. I agreed with the Prosecution that DW3’s evidence did not manage to shake PW5’s evidence. With respect to the pushing incident, while there may have been a discrepancy between _Exhibit P14_ and _Exhibit P15_ as to whether her left or right knee was injured, it was clear from the photograph taken by PW10 of the injury on her knee (_Exhibit P11_) that showed a knee injury on PW5. I agreed with the Prosecution that from the curvature and placement of both legs (the injured leg being front facing with another leg behind), it was clear that the injured knee was the _right_ knee.

157    After considering the totality of the evidence, I was of the view that PW5 was a credible witness on the facts in issue and gave full weight to her refreshed testimony that the accused had slapped _both sides_ of her face and pushed her against the kitchen doorway, causing the knee injury. Consequently, I found on the facts that the accused had intentionally caused hurt to PW5, a foreign domestic worker by slapping her face multiple times and pushing her causing her to suffer low frequency hearing loss and multiple contusions.

#### (ii)   MAC 907036 - 2018 – s 323 Penal Code charge

158    In respect of the second amended charge, it was the Prosecution’s case that the evidence against the accused came from the direct evidence of PW4 that was corroborated by the evidence from PW2, PW5, the various medical documents reflecting the injuries he suffered as well as photograph of the bite mark in _Exhibit P12_ taken by PW10 on the same night.

159    PW4 had testified that while trying to stop the “struggling” between the accused and PW5, the accused had bit him on the arm, kicked him on the stomach and pushed him. PW2 had testified that PW4 came out from the bedroom into the hall to stop the accused from slapping PW5 and that “they pushed each other. PW5 had testified that the accused had pushed PW4 causing PW4’s head to knock onto the bedroom door, following which the accused kicked PW4 on the chest area.

160    It was essentially the Prosecution’s case that the accused had intentionally caused hurt to her own father, PW4 by kicking his stomach and biting his left forearm. According to the Prosecution, the manner of the attack by the accused and the sequence of events showed that the accused’s actions were deliberate and motivated by rage. It was highlighted that the accused herself had admitted that she was “very angry that he’s taking side with the maid again”.

161    In the present case, although the accused does not deny that she had kicked him in his stomach and bit her own father’s left forearm, it was the case for the Defence that the hurt caused to PW4 was on grave and sudden provocation under section 334 of the Penal Code. According to the accused, she had absolutely no intention to harm him and that she had acted out of “reflex”. The accused had testified that PW4 had attempted to throw a chair at her and interlocked her arms.

162    It was also argued by the Defence that PW4 is a strong man despite advanced age and according to his medical report PW4’s “upper and lower limbs revealed power of 5”. It was submitted that the accused had asked him to let her go after he had interlocked her arms and she warned him she would bite him if he did not stop. According to the accused as he did not stop, she had placed her teeth onto his arm and the shock caused PW4 to release her. It was argued that PW4’s injuries on his left forearms were not due to the force she exerted but attributable to PW4’s “sensitive skin” in view of his age. The accused had also argued that she had reacted in that manner due to concern for PW2’s safety, as they were “directly behind” her.

163    Based on the totality of the evidence before me, I was not convinced that the accused had acted out of a reflex action when she kicked PW4 in his stomach and bit his left forearm. I agreed with the Prosecution that the manner of the attack by the accused and the sequence of events showed that the accused’s actions were deliberate and motivated by rage as she was angry that PW4 had taken PW5’s side. I further disagreed with the Defence’s assertion that the PW4 is a strong man despite his age by equating his muscle power to his muscle strength. Based on my personal observation of PW4 and the accused, I was unconvinced that the accused could be overpowered by her elderly father and did not think that PW4 was as strong as the accused had made him out or suggested him to be.

164    I further agreed with the Prosecution that the right to private defence under s 96 of the Penal Code (the version prior to the current version pursuant to Act 15 of 2019) was not made out on the facts as the restriction under s 99(3) of the Penal Code applied. There was clearly time in the present case to have recourse to the protection of the public authorities. I also agreed that the accused’s act of biting him clearly inflicted more harm than necessary for the purpose of defence, within the meaning of s 99(4) of the Penal Code, such that the right of private defence no longer applies. Based on the photograph in _Exhibit P12_, I did not accept the Defence’s submissions that the accused did not bite hard but had just placed her teeth on PW4’s arm to shock him into releasing her from his interlock. Consequently, based on the totality of the evidence, I rejected the accused’s version of events in relation to this charge and found that the accused had intentionally caused hurt to PW4 by kicking his stomach and biting his left forearm.

#### (iii)   MAC 907037 - 2018 – s 426 Penal Code charge

165    It was the Prosecution’s case that based on the evidence of PW2 after assaulting PW5 and PW4, the accused had gone into the kitchen and had thrown PW5’s handphone in the washing machine. Upon PW5’s return to the flat after seeking help from PW1 and the police, PW2 had informed PW5 of what the accused had done and had asked PW5 to pick it up subsequently. According to the Prosecution, PW2’s evidence coheres with PW5’s evidence as after PW2 had informed her that she had retrieved her phone from the washing machine, PW5 had realised that it was wet. PW5 had testified that as a result, the screen of her hand phone is blurry sometimes, although the hand phone was still functional.

166    It was submitted that although there was a discrepancy as to who was the one who had retrieved the handphone, there was other evidence supporting the charge. It was the Prosecution’s case that _Exhibit P18_ is a photograph which showed a hand phone with screen damage. PW5 had testified that that was the very phone that the accused placed into the washing machine. It was highlighted that it was not put to PW5 that this was assertion was false. In addition, PW10 had testified that on the same night, PW5 had told her that the handphone was spoilt having been thrown into the washing machine by the accused and that the hand phone had been left in rice to absorb the moisture.

167    It was further submitted that the accused’s response when being questioned about the handphone in her investigative statement (_Exhibit P19_) was inconsistent with innocence and stood in stark contradiction with her evidence in court. When asked a simple yes-no question of whether she threw PW5’s phone into the washing machine, she had answered that she did not remember. When confronted with her answer in Court, the accused went to lengths to explain how PW5 did not in fact have a phone and that she answered the way she did because she was “very confused”.

168    It was the case for the Defence that the only witness who claimed to have seen the accused throw PW5’s handphone into the washing machine was PW2 who suffered from dementia as affirmed by PW1 and the accused during the trial. It was submitted that PW2 was an unsatisfactory witness whose testimony was fraught with inconsistencies. It was the case for the Defence that PW2 also remembered significant facts which were clearly wrong or inaccurate.

169    It was also the case for the Defence that there was no objective evidence that the handphone was damaged on that night. No repair was done to the handphone and no photograph was taken of the handphone that night or soon after to prove the condition of the handphone. When PW10 saw PW5’s handphone on 13 March 2018, she had observed that there was nothing wrong with the handphone and “the phone was okay already”.

170    In my assessment of the evidence before me, I noted that it was undisputed that the only person who witnessed or could have witnessed the accused throwing PW5’s handphone into the machine machine was PW2. By then, both PW4 and PW5 had left the flat to seek police assistance. It was only after PW5 returned to the flat and was informed by PW2 of what had happened to her handphone that PW5 had found that her handphone was wet. When PW5 was interviewed by PW10, she had informed PW10 that the handphone had been thrown into the washing machine by the accused and it was slightly wet and could have been spoiled.

171    The Defence had characterised PW2 to be an unreliable witness on account of her dementia. Nevertheless, after having observed PW2 as she gave evidence in Court I had found her to be present and fairly coherent when giving evidence in particular on the key facts in issue. In my view, there was no reason for her to give evidence that the accused had thrown PW5’s handphone into the washing machine unless that was what she had observed the accused doing from her vantage point while sitting at the dining table. There was also no reason for her to implicate her own daughter of a wrongdoing unless it was the truth. I was unconvinced that she had been manipulated by PW5 to implicate the accused as suggested by the Defence. I noted that the accused was evasive in her response when questioned about the handphone in her investigative statement (_Exhibit P19_).

172    In addition, I was mindful that PW5’s evidence that _Exhibit P18_ was the photograph of the handphone that the accused had placed into the washing machine was unchallenged by the Defence. PW10 had also testified that on the same night, PW5 had told her that the handphone was spoilt having been thrown into the washing machine by the accused and that the handphone had been left in rice to absorb the moisture.

173    Based on the totality of the evidence before me, I was satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to prove that the accused had committed mischief by deliberately damaging PW5’s handphone by throwing it into the washing machine.

#### MAC 907038 - 2018 – s 337(a) Penal Code charge

174    It was the Prosecution’s case that after committing the three offences above, the accused had gone downstairs of Blk 17 Eunos Crescent and had intended to leave the scene in her car. PW1 had tried to stop the accused from leaving but she had managed to get to her car and locked herself inside. PW1 then testified that after failing to open the car door, he hit the car screen once, and then went to the front of the car. As PW1 stood near the car, the accused then accelerated her car forward and to avoid the impact, PW1 had jumped on the car bonnet and rolled off the side. According to PW1, after hitting him, the accused had turned right, opened the window and laughed sarcastically. Subsequently, while driving to the hospital he felt pain on his knee.

175    It was the Prosecution’s case that PW1’s evidence was corroborated by PW5 as well as his CGH medical report dated 3 April 2018 where he had complained of a painful knee after jumping onto the bonnet of a car and rolled off. The examining doctor had noted that there was tenderness over his right knee and he was prescribed oral analgesia. According to PW5, after failing to open the accused’s car door, PW1 had knocked in the screen of the car once. PW1 then went in front of the car with his body being “very near to the car”. PW5 then heard “the gear of the car…very loud”, then “ran very fast” and she saw PW1 “turning”. According to the Prosecution, this was consistent with PW1’s earlier description that he ‘rolled’ off the car. PW5 had also testified that the accused drove off, turned right, “opened the window and laugh very loud” as if insulting PW1.

176    It was the case for the Defence that PW1’s complaint was incredible and unsupported by the objective evidence. It was submitted that it was unbelievable that PW1 could humanly react in lightning speed when he was standing at such close proximity from the accused’s car to jump onto the car bonnet when the car was accelerating at high speed towards him. It was equally unbelievable that PW1 could simply roll over the bonnet and land on his feet when he fell off a speeding car. According to the Defence, despite the car hitting him at such high acceleration it was unbelievable that there was no trace of any bruise or scratch on PW1. There was also no scratch or bruise on the part of his body that landed on the car.

177    It was argued by the Defence that PW1’s medical report did not state that he was hit by a car and instead stated that “He presented with a painful knee after jumping onto the bonnet of a car, and rolled off. It was highlighted that the police had failed to inspect the car in question despite the request by the accused to do so. It was submitted that the accused’s defence that it was PW1 who had punched her window violently many times that caused her to drive away. According to her, she thought PW1 was going to kill her and break her skull. She wanted to call for the police and felt that she needed immediate help. She was certain that PW1 was not in front of her when she drove away.

178    Based on the totality of the evidence before me, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven that the accused had caused hurt by committing a rash act that endangered human life when she drove her car forward at PW1, causing him to roll over the bonnet of her car and to suffer tenderness over his right knee. I did not accept her defence that the accused had driven off because she had feared for her life. This was evident from the fact that she had not sought for assistance from the police either at the ground floor of Block 9 Eunos Crescent where she resided or from the passing police patrol car that had entered the said carpark.

179    Accordingly, after a careful consideration of the totality of the evidence as well as the written submissions before me, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt on all four of the proceeded charges in **MAC 907035 - 2018** to **MAC 907038 – 2018** and convicted her. I did not accept her defence that was essentially a bare denial of the first amended charge, the third amended charge as well as the fourth amended charge and her defence that she had acted in self-defence in respect of the second amended charge.

## I.   Antecedents

180    The accused was untraced.

## J.   Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

181    In its oral address on sentence, the Prosecution had urged the Court to impose the following sentences:

> (i)     six weeks’ imprisonment for each of the two charges under s 323 of the Penal Code;

> (ii)     the imposition of a fine for the charge under s 426 of the Penal Code and

> (iii)     a sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment and an order that the accused be disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of twelve months for the charge under s 337(a) of the Penal Code.

182    In relation to the first amended charge and the second amended charge under s 323 of the Penal Code, it was submitted that the guideline case in point is _Low Song Chye v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 140</span>, a recent High Court judgment that gave guidance on the sentencing approach for s 323 Penal Code offences. According to two-step framework, the indicative sentencing range based on actual harm caused should be identified, and then the indicative sentence could be adjusted based on relevant factors.

## MAC 907035 - 2018

183    It was submitted that according to the sentencing bands at \[77\] of _Low Song Chye_, the harm caused in the first amended charge to PW5, which is mild low frequency hearing loss and multiple contusions would fall within Band 2, which is “Moderate harm”, because it constitutes a temporary or mild loss of a sensory function. For Band 2 cases, the indicative sentencing range for step 1 is between four weeks’ to six months’ imprisonment.

184    It was further submitted that in determining as to where exactly the facts of this case fall within this range, some guidance could be obtained from the facts of _Low Song Chye_ itself. In that case, the accused had slapped the victim once causing mild hearing loss to the victim. There was evidence that the victim’s hearing impairment was persistent to some extent and she also suffered from persistent tinnitus. There was also evidence that this had affected her sleep at least at one point. Thus, having regard to this actual harm caused alone, Justice See Kee Oon had placed the starting point to be between 2 to 3 months’ imprisonment within Band 2 in _Low Song Chye_.

185    It was further submitted that the actual harm caused to PW5 in this case is, somewhat less serious than what the victim sustained in _Low Song Chye_. However, PW5 also reported tinnitus, pain and she also reported that her hearing only improved over the course of one month. It was the Prosecution’s case that while the actual harm was not as serious as the victim in _Low Song Chye_, there was still some degree of persistence. As the Prosecution was of the view that the indicative starting range should only be slightly lower than the two to three months point in _Low Song Chye_, an indicative starting range of about five weeks’ imprisonment was proposed.

186    Moving on to step 2, the adjustment for culpability, it was submitted that the accused’s culpability was high. She had inflicted multiple hard slaps on PW5 as opposed to a single slap in the case of _Low Song Chye_. PW5 being a foreign domestic worker was also a vulnerable victim. It was further submitted that the violence was completely unprovoked and the accused showed utter lack of remorse. Based on this, there should be an upward adjustment to the indicative starting point, and it was submitted that a sentence of at least six weeks’ imprisonment to be imposed for this charge.

## MAC 907036 - 2018

187    In respect of the second amended charge under s 323 of the Penal Code of causing hurt against PW4, it was submitted that the harm caused was a 4 cm circular erythema and mild tenderness over the right-side upper abdomen. These injuries would be considered as minor and Band 1 would be applicable. Within Band 1, it was further submitted that the indicative sentencing range should be close to the upper end of four weeks’ imprisonment. This was because there were two different types of harm caused to two different parts of the body namely the 4 cm circular erythema was over the left forearm and the mild tenderness was over the right-side upper abdomen.

188    Moving to step 2, the adjustment for culpability, it was submitted that similarly the accused’s culpability was high in respect of this charge. She had first bitten PW1 and even after PW1 had fallen down, she had kicked him on the abdomen. The attack was once again, completely unprovoked and moreover, the victim is elderly man. In addition, there was a similar lack of remorse. Thus, this would justify an upward adjustment to six weeks’ imprisonment.

## MAC 907037 - 2018

189    As for the third amended charge concerning mischief to PW5’s handphone, it was submitted that the usual sentence for such of offences is a fine. The Prosecution would not object to a fine with the exact quantum left to the Court’s discretion. It was highlighted that, there are cases where even though the damage to the item involved is not much, for example, a few hundred dollars, the eventual fine imposed could be higher.

## MAC 907037 - 2018

190    In respect of the fourth charge of causing hurt by committing a rash act endangering human life, the Prosecution had submitted sentencing precedents involving factual scenarios of slightly more analogous facts of offenders driving vehicles rashly and it was the Prosecution’s case that the benchmark sentence is a short custodial term. In _PP v Xu Feng Jia_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGMC 42</span>, involving a lesser charge under s 336(a) and the limb was endangering personal safety, the offender had revved his car forward when the victim who is a police officer still had his left hand on the driver’s door. The offender was sentenced to 6 weeks’ imprisonment with a 12 months’ disqualification for all classes of vehicles. In the present case, although, the victim was not a police officer, the charge was more serious one as it was under s 337(a) for endangering human life.

191    It was submitted that the next two cases equally support the submission that a custodial term must be imposed where such facts are involved. In _PP v Suratman Bin Daud_ (SC-906343-2016), the offender did not comply with the directions of a uniformed police officer and drove his car off when the officer was still standing close to the vehicle with the hands still on the driver’s door handle. The charge in _MAC-911304-2017_ was a lesser charge under s 336(a), and the offender was sentenced to six weeks’ imprisonment with a 12 months’ disqualification for all classes of vehicles.

192    The third case was _PP v Kesavan Pillai Govindan_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 44</span> involved an offender who drove his car forward when a Certis CISCO auxiliary police officer was standing right in front of the car. The car hit the victim’s shin twice causing hurt. The offender was sentenced to nine weeks’ imprisonment with 15 months’ disqualification for all classes of vehicles. It was submitted that adjusting for the fact that the victim in the present case was not an enforcement officer, the car was only driven forward once and the accused person was untraced, the imprisonment term in order should be less than nine weeks’ imprisonment. It was suggested that a sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment and 12 months’ disqualification for all classes of vehicles be imposed.

193    In _PP v Lai Zhi Heng_ (SC-912644-2015), a case involving a facts scenario committed not on a law enforcement officer, the victim had tried to prevent the accused person from leaving the scene and it involved the victim who had placed his body on the front bonnet of the accused’s car. The rash act involved under s 337(a) was the offender suddenly accelerating. As a result of the rash act, the victim suffered some form of injuries was given seven days of medical leave. It was submitted that adjusting for the fact that the injuries in the present case was more minor and that less charges were involved, a shorter imprisonment term than the one imposed of six months would be appropriate.

## Global Sentence

194    In respect of the global sentence, the Prosecution had asked for the imprisonment terms in the first, second and the fourth charges to run consecutively. It was submitted that although the offences took place in a single day, they involved different victims, different manners of attack for different reasons. The accused person had essentially gone on a violence spree committing so many violence related offences with-within a short span of time. She obviously has no regard for the harm that she inflicted and remains absolutely unremorseful. It was the Prosecution’s case that the total sentence must reflect her high culpability.

## K.   Mitigation

### Submission on sentence for the s 323 Penal Code charges

195    In her written plea in mitigation, it was submitted that the leading case precedent is the recent High Court decision of _Low Song Chye v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 140</span>. It was further submitted that reference should also be made to _PP v Wang Jiaxin_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGDC 23</span>.

196    It was further submitted that a fine should be imposed given that:

> (a)     there was no charge of premeditation;

> (b)     the injuries are minor although there was marginal loss of hearing for PW5. There was no hospitalization nor medical leave issued for PW4 and PW5;

> (c)     there is no evidence of damage to the ear drum;

> (d)     there is no evidence of bruises or abrasions on PW5’s face;

> (e)     other than the bite and mild tenderness over PW4’s abdomen, there were no serious injuries;

> (f)     there was no use of weapon;

> (g)     it does not involve a group attack;

> (h)     the altercation lasted for only a short time;

> (i)     the accused had a clean criminal record;

> (j)     the accused had been the sole care giver and sole provider for her parents from 2005 to September 2017.

197    According to her Counsel, the Defence had a different understanding of how the injuries were inflicted. The accused took the position that it was, firstly, a kick followed by a bite and and these acts done by the accused in self-defence when she was having her responsive acts towards PW4’s actions towards her. It was submitted that the Defence disagreed that it was unprovoked attack on PW4.

### Submission on Sentence for s 426 Penal Code charge

198    It was highlighted that the commentary in the Practitioner’s Library – Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts, 3rd Edition, LexisNexis 2013 at \[947\] to \[949\] states:

> “The variety of ways in which the offence may be committed can be seen in the provisions of ss 425, 426 to 440, which range from simple mischief to mischief involving the use of fire or any explosive substance. The most common prosecutions in this category of offences are those under ss 426 and 427.

> As the offences under ss 426 and 427 can be committed in a wide range of situations, the sentencing disposition would inevitably turn on the unique circumstances of each case and of the offender. ….

> Where there are no aggravating or mitigating factors, the usual sentence imposed is a fine. Such a sentence will usually be imposed where the damage caused to the property is not extensive and is easily reversible. This may also be the case where the loss suffered in monetary

> terms is small. Significant considerations affecting the sentencing disposition would include the loss in monetary terms suffered by the complainant as a result of the offence, whether the offender acted impulsively or with premeditation, the likelihood or risk of personal injury arising from the offence, circumstances of the mischief, age of the offender, prevalence of the offence, the extensiveness and irreversibility of the damage and the offender’s criminal record (especially concerning property offences).

> Where some aspect of public interest is engaged, more severe sentences (including custody) have also been imposed. For example, where the offence was committed in the ‘road rage’ context, the courts have imposed a sentence of imprisonment as a general deterrent; …….”

199    It was submitted that a fine should be imposed given that:

> (a)     there was no charge of premeditation;

> (b)     it was a one-off incident;

> (c)     there was no evidence of the amount of damage caused;

> (d)     the accused had a clean criminal record.

### Submission on Sentence for s 337(a) Penal Code charge

200    It was submitted that a fine should be imposed given that:

> (a)     there was no charge of premeditation;

> (b)     it was a one-off incident;

> (c)     the injury was minor i.e. pain over the right knee;

> (d)     the Defendant has a clean criminal record.

201    It was further submitted that the accused had stopped visiting her parents since 28 February 2018 and there is no risk of any future contact between the parties. It was highlighted that the first three sentencing precedents involved law enforcement officer and for the fourth precedent more serious injuries were involved.

## Global Sentence

202    It was submitted that if the Court was not with the Defence on the imposition of fines and would impose three jail sentences, no more than two consecutive sentences should run together as these charges involves incidents that occur on single day.

203    It was further submitted if the Court was minded to impose jail sentences for three charges, either the first or the second charge should run consecutively with the fourth charge instead of having three consecutive sentences.

## L.   Prosecution’s Reply

204    In response to the accused’s written plea in mitigation, it was highlighted by the Prosecution that the Defence Counsel had understated the harm caused to PW5 in the first amended charge. It was submitted that although the hearing loss was characterised as mild, it had clearly affected her for a period of time. Although there were no bruises per se seen on her face, there was tenderness on various parts of her face namely, the left anterior lateral side of her neck, left temporomandibular joint region and over the left ear. There was also a knee abrasion. It was the Prosecution’s case that it was incorrect to say that the harm caused was minor.

205    It was further submitted that for the second amended charge, the Court had found against what the Defence was saying which is that the acts were committed out of self-defence or due to provocation. It was the Prosecution’s case that based in what the Court had found, the Prosecution’s submissions were justified. It was emphasised that PW4 was 71 years old at the time of the attack.

206    As for the fourth charge, it was submitted that it was entirely fortuitous that the actual harm caused was just a knee contusion. The potential harm which could have resulted could have been much, much more serious. It was the Prosecution’s case that the lack of premeditation, use of weapon or the absence of a group attack are simply the lack of aggravating factors which were not in and out themselves mitigating.

## M.   The Sentences

#### Prescribed punishment for voluntarily causing hurt

207    The prescribed punishment for an offence of voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 of the Penal Code is a term of imprisonment which may extend to two years or with a fine which may extend to $5,000 or with both.

208    I agreed with both the Prosecution and the Defence that in relation to the first amended charge and the second amended charge under s 323 of the Penal Code, the guideline case on point is _Low Song Chye v PP_ the recent High Court judgment that gave guidance on sentencing approach for s of 323 Penal Code offences. According to the two-step framework at \[78\] of the case, the Court should:

> (a)     First, identify the sentencing band and where the particular case falls within the indicative sentencing range by considering the hurt caused by the offence.

> (b)     Next, the court should make the necessary adjustments to the indicative starting point based on its assessment of the offender’s culpability as well as other relevant factors.

#### MAC 907035 - 2018 – first amended charge

209    In respect of the first amended charge I agreed with the Prosecution that based on the harm caused, the offence would fall within Band 2, which is “Moderate harm”, because it constitutes a temporary or mild loss of a sensory function.

#### First step

210    In determining as to where exactly the facts of the present case fell within the prescribed range for Band 2, I was guided by the facts in _Low Song Chye_. As highlighted by the Prosecution the victim was slapped once and had suffered a mild hearing loss. The victim’s hearing impairment was persistent to some extent as she suffered from persistent tinnitus and this had affected her sleep at least at one point. I agreed with the Prosecution that the actual harm caused to PW5 was less serious than what the victim sustained in _Low Song Chye_ and there was some degree of persistence and also agreed with the indicative starting range of about five weeks’ imprisonment.

#### Second step

211    In making the necessary adjustments to the indicative starting point based on its assessment of the offender’s culpability as well as other relevant factors, I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused’s culpability was high. She had not only inflicted multiple hard slaps on PW5’s face but had also pushed her. I also agreed that being a foreign domestic worker, PW5 was also a vulnerable victim. I further agreed that the violence was completely unprovoked and the accused was clearly unremorseful for her actions.

212    I was mindful that the whole series of events began when the accused came over to her parents’ home to confront and scold the accused for keeping PW1 updated. As the accused was not even PW5’s employee, she had no locus to confront PW5 even if she was dissatisfied with her action. Based on this, I agreed with the Prosecution that there should be an upward adjustment to the indicative starting point. After a careful consideration of the Prosecution’s address on sentence, the written plea in mitigation as well as the factual matrix of the charge I imposed a sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment on the accused.

#### MAC 907036 - 2018 – second amended charge

213    In respect of the second amended charge under s 323 of the Penal Code of causing hurt against PW4, I agreed with the Prosecution that the injuries suffered by PW1 were minor and should fall within Band 1 and the indicative sentencing range should be close to the upper end of four weeks’ imprisonment. I was mindful that there were two different types of harm caused to two different parts of the body, namely the 4 cm circular erythema was over the left forearm and the mild tenderness over the right-side upper abdomen.

214    For step 2, the adjustment for culpability, I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused’s culpability was high in respect of this charge. She had first bitten PW1, her own father who was advance in age and had a host of medical issues and even after PW1 had fallen down, she had kicked him on the abdomen. I was of the view the attack was completely unprovoked and disagree with the Defence that these acts were done by the accused in self-defence when she was having her responsive acts towards PW4’s actions towards her. It was clear the accused was unremorseful for her actions. Accordingly, after a careful consideration of the Prosecution’s address on sentence, the written plea in mitigation as well as the factual matrix of the charge, I agreed with the Prosecution that this would justify an uplift of the sentence and imposed a sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment.

#### MAC 907037 - 2018 – third amended charge

#### Prescribed punishment for voluntarily causing hurt

215    The prescribed punishment for an offence of mischief under s 426 of the Penal Code is a term of imprisonment which may extend to one year or with a fine or with both. I agreed with the Prosecution that the the usual sentence for such offences is a fine.

216    I noted that PW5 had testified that after the accused had thrown her handphone into the washing machine, the screen of her phone is sometimes blurry, although the phone was still functional. It was unchallenged that she had purchased it in January 2018 and had paid the equivalent of S$450 for it. I was mindful that in the present case there was no quantification of the damage caused to the handphone. Nevertheless, the handphone is an item of value especially to a foreign domestic worker as it is a means of communication with her family and her friends. After a careful consideration of the Prosecution’s address on sentence, the written plea in mitigation as well as the factual matrix of the charge, totality of the evidence, I was of the view that a fine of $800 was just and appropriate in the circumstances.

#### MAC 907038 - 2018 – fourth amended charge

#### Prescribed punishment for causing hurt by doing a rash act which endangers human life

217    The prescribed punishment for an offence of causing hurt by doing a rash act which endangers human life under s 377(a) of the Penal Code is a term of imprisonment which may extend to one year or with a fine which may extend to $5,000 or with both. The Prosecution had urged the Court to impose a sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment and 12 months’ disqualification for all classes of vehicles while the Defence had urged the Court to impose a fine.

218    I agreed with the Prosecution that the custodial sentence threshold had been crossed and a term of imprisonment should be imposed. I further agreed with the Prosecution that a downward adjustment should be made for the fact that the victim in the present case was not an enforcement officer who was in the course of his duties, the car was only driven forward once, the victim suffered tenderness over the right knee and the accused person was untraced, the imprisonment term in order should be less than nine weeks’ imprisonment. After a careful consideration of the Prosecution’s address on sentence, the written plea in mitigation as well as the factual matrix of the charge, I agreed with the Prosecution that a sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment and 12 months’ disqualification for all classes of vehicles.

#### Global sentence

219    After having decided on the individual sentences, I had to decide which of the sentences should run consecutively. This was because by virtue of section 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68 Rev Ed 2012), I must order at least two sentences of imprisonment to run consecutively.

220    In respect of the global sentence, I was of the view that the imprisonment terms of the first amended charge and the second amended ought to be ordered to run consecutively. I was mindful as highlighted by the Prosecution that although the offences took place in a single day, they involved different victims, different manners of attack and for different reasons. I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused person had gone on a violence spree committing so many violence related offences with-within a short span of time. She clearly had no regard for the harm that she had inflicted and remained unremorseful. Accordingly, the total sentence must reflect the overall criminality of the accused’s conduct. Hence, I ordered the sentences for **MAC 907035 - 2018** and **MAC 907036 - 2018** to run consecutively with the remaining charge in **MAC 907038 - 2018** to run concurrently.

221    Dissatisfied with my decision, the accused had filed a Notice of Appeal against her conviction and sentences in respect of **MAC 907035 - 2018** to **MAC 907038 - 2018** on 16 December 2019.
