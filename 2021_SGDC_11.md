Tort – Negligence – Duty of care

Tort – Negligence – Contributory negligence

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in DCA 38/2020.\]

25 February 2021

### District Judge Dorothy F M Ling:

## Introduction[^1]

1       This was the Plaintiff’s claim for injuries that he sustained on 23 May 2016 while at work. He alleged negligence on his employer’s part. The defendant, who was his employer, denied liability for the plaintiff’s injuries and argued that the plaintiff was solely responsible for his own injury. Further and in the alternative, the defendant averred that the plaintiff was himself contributorily negligent. The trial was only on the issue of liability.

2       The Court found in the plaintiff’s favour to the extent of two-thirds of the damages to be assessed. Dissatisfied with the finding, the plaintiff has appealed against the whole of the decision.

## Facts

### The parties

3       The plaintiff was a Chinese national who was employed by the defendant as a carpenter since 18 June 2015. At the time of the accident on 23 May 2016, the plaintiff was 25 years old.

4       The defendant was in the business of “manufacturing of prefabricated wooden building structures”.[^2] It was also the occupier of a factory at 6 Marsiling Industrial Estate Road 1, #01-20 Marsiling Industrial Estate, Singapore 739275 (“**the premises**”).

### The accident

5       The accident happened on 23 May 2016 on the premises at about 9.05am. This was about one hour after the plaintiff started work at 8am.

6       According to the plaintiff, the accident happened when he was “carrying out his usual duties of fabricating wooden door frames”.[^3] To do that, the plaintiff was required to “saw timbers to the requisite dimensions and in connection with this requirement, he had to make use of a cross cutting saw”[^4] (“**cutting saw**”) on the premises.

7       While he was sawing a timber with a cutting saw on that day, his legs slipped “and the movement caused his right hand that was pulling out the cutting saw to jerk”.[^5] As a result of that, his left hand which was holding the piece of timber made contact with the cutting saw. Consequently, his left index finger was amputated by the exposed cutting saw at the distal interphalangeal joint.

8       The plaintiff therefore alleged “breach of the statutory duties, occupier’s and/or common law duty of care of the Defendant\[ \] and/or \[its\] employees, servants and/or agents for whom the Defendant\[ \] \[is\] vicariously liable for.”[^6] In his Statement of Claim,[^7] the plaintiff laid out 33 particulars of the defendant’s breach and/or negligence.[^8]

## The parties’ cases

### The plaintiff’s case

9       The above recount was largely the plaintiff’s version of how the accident happened.

10     It was therefore the plaintiff’s pleaded case that[^9] –

> (a)     he was merely performing his usual duties that day and fabricating wooden door frames which necessitated the use of the cutting saw;

> (b)     the cutting saw was exposed;

> (c)     as he was using the cutting saw, operating it by pulling it forward with his right hand, and his left hand holding the timber that was being sawn, his legs slipped, which movement caused his right hand to jerk and his left hand to come into contact with the exposed blade of the cutting saw; and

> (d)     he thereby suffered injuries sustained therefrom.

11     The plaintiff also relied on the Workplace Safety and Health Act (Cap 354A, 2009 Rev Ed) (“**WSHA**”) and its pieces of subsidiary legislation,[^10] and raised arguments that the defendant had breached certain provisions therein.

### The defendant’s case

12     According to the defendant, however, 23 May 2016 was a day when the plaintiff was scheduled to do installation works at another worksite with a co-worker. There was therefore no need to operate any machinery that day at the premises; there was no need to operate the cutting saw.[^11]

13     The defendant further averred that while its workers were “packing the materials and equipment in preparation to leave… for the… worksite \[where they were to do installation works\], the \[p\]laintiff suddenly disappeared from his co-worker’s sight”.[^12] They later heard him shouting and found him “at a woodworking machine with an injured left finger from being cut by the cutting saw.

14     The defendant considered that the plaintiff could not have cut his finger the way that he allegedly did, in view of “the mechanics of the woodworking machine and how it \[was\] used to cut wood”.[^13] It was therefore the defendant’s case that “\[t\]he Plaintiff’s injury was self-inflicted and the result of a deliberate act”.[^14]

15     It was also the defendant’s alternative case that if the accident had taken place the way the plaintiff described it to have happened, the defendant provided reasons[^15] why it was solely the plaintiff’s own conduct or negligence that had caused the injuries, or that he contributed to it by his own negligence[^16].

## Issues to be determined

16     The broad issue in the present case was whether the defendant was liable for the plaintiff’s injuries. If so, whether the plaintiff was himself contributorily negligent for his own injuries.

17     At the heart of the above stated issues was the factual issue of how the accident happened, particularly since the defendant argued that the accident was not _bona fide_. This must first be determined.

## The Court’s decision

18     It is trite to state that the burden was on the plaintiff to prove his case as pleaded and on a balance of probabilities. The plaintiff’s case was that he slipped, and in that happening, his left hand came into contact with the cutting saw and his left index finger got amputated.

### Issue 1: How the accident occurred; was it bona fide?

#### Plaintiff’s version

19     The plaintiff deposed in his affidavit that the accident happened when he was preparing the materials that he would need for installation works that would take place later that morning. These materials included some wooden support pieces that the plaintiff claimed he “was required”[^17] to saw from timbers.

20     As he did so, his legs slipped, which movement caused his right hand – which was operating the cutting saw – to jerk. The jerk caused his left hand – which was holding the timber which was to be sawn – to make contact with the cutting saw. It was the plaintiff’s case that as the blade of the cutting saw was exposed, it amputated his left index finger when his left hand touched the exposed blade.[^18]

21     In his affidavit, besides his grievance about the exposed cutting saw, the plaintiff also complained that they were not provided with any vice or clamp to secure the timber for cutting. Notably, the latter was not pleaded. However, it was not seriously argued by the plaintiff either.

22     As for his legs slipping which he pleaded in his Statement of Claim,[^19] the plaintiff explained in his affidavit that it was “as a result of the smooth surface of the plywood that had been placed on the ground.”[^20] He then continued to explain the presence of the plywood on the ground: “… because our boss did not want paint stains on the ground while spray painting works was (_sic_) carried out.”[^21] The plaintiff also made reference to the “plenty of small strips of timber lying around” and “sawdust that had accumulated on the surface over time.”[^22]

23     In his closing submissions, defendant’s counsel drew attention to the fact that the plaintiff had not pleaded in his Statement of Claim as to what caused his foot to slip.[^23] Defendant’s counsel argued that as this was a material fact and it was not pleaded, the plaintiff was not entitled to give evidence of this at the trial.

#### Defendant’s version

24     With regard to the accident, the defendant argued that as the plaintiff and his co-worker were scheduled to move to another worksite to do installation works, the plaintiff was not supposed to be operating any machine that day, let alone the cutting saw. It was even averred by the defendant that the plaintiff “suddenly disappeared from his co-worker’s sight”[^24] and they only found him when he shouted from having injured himself. He was then by the cutting saw.

25     The defendant argued that given the mechanics of the cutting saw and “how it is used to cut wood”,[^25] “the Plaintiff could not have cut his finger in the manner as described in the Statement of Claim”.[^26] The defendant urged upon this Court that the plaintiff’s injury was “self-inflicted and the result of a deliberate act”.[^27]

26     The defendant went as far as to break down the movements of the plaintiff’s body to show the implausibility of the accident[^28] as if the audience was watching a slow motion of an accident:

> (1)     The Plaintiff _tilted his head_;

> (2)     This resulted in the Plaintiff having to move his leg;

> (3)     The Plaintiff’s _leg moved_. He slipped;

> (4)     The right hand (that was holding on to the saw) pulled _back_;

> (5)     The Plaintiff’s _body moved to the left;_

> (6)     The Plaintiff’s _left hand_ (that was holding the block) surged _forward_;

> (7)     The Plaintiff _leaned backwards_ but did not fall as his _left hand was on the table_.

(Italics in original.)

27     It was then submitted, “It is curious how these various movements could have occurred concurrently so as to result in the accident.”[^29] Reference was then made to “opposing body movements” occurring “concurrently”[^30] such as the right hand moving back whilst the left hand moved forward, the plaintiff leaning backwards but his hand was on the table in front.

#### The Court’s determination

28     With all due respect to the learned defendant’s counsel, this Court was unable to appreciate the suggestion of that implausibility. This was a situation where the plaintiff had slipped and in the process, injured himself at a cutting saw. He was the one who slipped, and so, could not be in a position to have observed _how_ he slipped. Any description that the plaintiff gave of how his limbs moved and other bodily movements, would, at best, also be a conjecture on his part. There is no standard pattern of bodily movements when a person slips. In fact, considering the description of how the different parts of the plaintiff’s body and limbs might have splayed as a reflex action since he was losing his balance, I was in fact inclined to consider that an accident was very plausible. It appeared amiss to me that the defendant should place weight on the plaintiff’s description of how he fell to determine if the accident was self-inflicted.

29     On the defendant’s argument that the accident was not _bona fide_, Plaintiff’s counsel countered this by highlighting to the Court contemporaneous documents which were filled in by the defendant itself, which documents were unequivocal in declaring that the accident was _bona fide_. There was no suggestion that the plaintiff had self-inflicted his injuries. These documents included –

> (a)     the Incident Report lodged by the defendant to the Ministry of Manpower just three days after the accident; and

> (b)     the document submitted for workmen’s compensation claim to the defendant’s insurers giving notice of the accident.

30     In _Goldrich Venture Pte Ltd and another v Halcyon Offshore Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 103</span> at \[78\], Steven Chong J stated:

>     …\[T\]he difficulties in the defendant’s narrative, however numerous, do not assist the plaintiffs with the proof of its affirmative case. I am not faced with a binary choice between accepting either the plaintiff’s account of events or that of the defendant’s. In other words, rejection of the defendant’s case theory does not invariably entail acceptance of the plaintiff’s.

(See also: _Wee Yue Chew v Su Sh-Hsyu_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGHC 50</span> at \[8\].)

So, this Court was mindful that although it considered that there are difficulties in the defendant’s case, the burden of proof continues to remain with the plaintiff.

31     As mentioned, the plaintiff’s case was that he slipped and so, cut himself on the cutting saw. Considering that the premises was what appeared to be a place for wood works, it was evident – from the video footages that the court had the benefit of viewing during the course of the proceedings – that the place was expectedly strewn with sawdust. It was also the court’s observation that there were pieces of wood piled up in various areas of the premises.

32     The defendant’s counsel had argued that the plaintiff did not plead how he slipped, and since those were material facts which should have been pleaded, but the plaintiff did not, consequently the plaintiff was prohibited from adducing evidence of the same.

33     Even if the court were to accept that proposition – including the point that how the plaintiff slipped was a material fact – there was enough for this court to find, on a balance of probabilities, that there were conditions ‘conducive’ to occasion a slip which resulted in the accident in issue. This court was therefore of the view that the plaintiff had discharged his burden of proving on a balance of probabilities, that the accident happened when he slipped and badly cut himself.

34     Contrarily, there was little for the court to agree with the defendant’s proposition that the accident was self-inflicted. Mr Lim Kim Ping, the director of the defendant-company (DW1) had deposed in his affidavit that “a few days before the alleged accident, the Plaintiff had informed his colleagues\[ \] of his intention to resign as he wanted to return to his home country to attend to some family matters”.[^31] Besides the fact that this was hearsay, the court had found this neither here nor there and did not lend weight to the defendant’s case that the alleged accident was in fact not an accident but was self-inflicted.

### Issue 2: Whether the defendant was liable for the plaintiff’s injuries

35     The law on this is clear and is set out in the oft-quoted case of _Miah Rasel v 5 Ways Engineering Services Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 235</span> at \[26\] which cites the case of _Chen Qiangshi v Hong Fei CDY Construction Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 177</span>:

>     … the four-fold test for negligence is trite: (a) the defendant must have owed the claimant a duty of care; (b) the defendant’s conduct must have breached the duty of care by falling below the requisite standard of care; (c) the claimant must have suffered loss; and (d) the defendant’s breach of duty must have been a cause of the claimant’s loss.

36     It was not disputed that the defendant, being the plaintiff’s employer, owed the plaintiff a duty of care. It was also not disputed that the claimant “suffered loss” in that he suffered injuries. The issues in the present case were whether the defendant’s conduct breached the requisite standard of duty of care, and this breach was the cause of the claimant’s “loss”.

37     Before I examine the above, I should state that although the plaintiff relied much on the WSHA and its subsidiary and related legislation, section 60(1) of the WSHA is unequivocal when it states –

>     Nothing in this Act shall be construed… as conferring a right of action in any civil proceedings in respect of any contravention, whether by act or omission, of any provision of this Act…

Nevertheless, the WSHA and its subsidiary legislation are useful in providing guidance for the scope of the standard of care that the defendant should adopt, in their position _vis-à-vis_ the plaintiff.

38     The defendant questioned the weight that should be accorded to “regulations, codes and guidelines”.[^32] The cases of _Jurong Primewide Pte Ltd v Crescendas Bionics Pte Ltd and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGCA 63</span> and its referred cases of _Tesa Tape Asia Pacific Pte Ltd v Wing Seng Logistics Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 3 SLR(R) 116</span> and _The “Emma Maersk”_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] SGHC 180</span> were cited by defendant’s counsel. Defendant’s counsel argued that the Codes of Practice or Circulars referred to in the various cases could be relied on in those cases only because both counsel accepted the Code or Circular or if not, they had expert witnesses testify on the requisite standard. The defendant thus sought to distinguish the present case from these cases.

39     It might have been so in the case authorities cited, that both counsel accepted the standard in the Code or they called expert witnesses. However, this Court was of the view that it did not mean that if both counsel were not in agreement on whatever Code or Circular, that the Court should not refer to them for guidance on the requisite standard of care. Furthermore, in the present case, we were not referring to just mere Codes or Circulars. We were also referring to pieces of subsidiary legislation which irrefutably constitute the law of the land – e.g., the Workplace Safety and Health (General Provisions) Regulations (Cap 254A, Rg 1, 2007 Rev Ed) and the Workplace Safety and Health (Risk Management) Regulations (Cap 254A, Rg 8, 2007 Rev Ed). Reference was also made in paragraphs 84 to 87 of plaintiff’s counsel’s closing submissions to the work of the Workplace Safety and Health Council (“**the Council**”). The Council is a body constituted under section 39 of the WSHA and its functions enumerated in section 40A of the same. With such a mandate given to the Council, surely its Codes of Practice and Guidelines should not be slighted. I would consider them as putting into effect and practical ways the acceptable standards for “safety, health and welfare of persons at work in workplaces” – to quote from the long title of the WSHA.

40     I was therefore of the view that I may take reference from the Guidelines or Codes that the Council had issued, which were enumerated in plaintiff’s counsel’s submissions:

> (a)     the “Workplace Safety & Health Guidelines – Safe Use of Machinery”;

> (b)     “The Code of Practice on Workplace Safety and Health Risk Management”;

> (c)     “A Guide to the Workplace Safety and Health (Risk Management) Regulations”; and

> (d)     “Workplace Safety and Health Guidelines – Investigating Workplace Incidents for SMEs”.

41     Plaintiff’s counsel also directed the court’s attention to the Council’s recommendations in “Singapore Standards SS 537: Part 1: 2008: Code of Practice for Safe Use of Machinery” which, in brief, includes the use of guards, which may be adjustable or self-adjusting.

42     I would have to agree with the plaintiff to some extent that if either the adjustable guard or the self-adjusting guard had been in place on the cutting saw, the risks to injury would be better managed, controlled or even eliminated. Like plaintiff’s counsel submitted, “Even if the Plaintiff had slipped and fallen… his finger would not have been severed as a result of contact with the moving saw blade”[^33] because there would have been the guard to prevent the contact. The fact remained, that there was no guard and the accident happened.

43     The defendant had argued that “the lack of a guard was not a proximate cause of his legs suddenly slipping”.[^34] I agreed with that. But, it was the proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injuries.

44     That the defendant had not ensured the safety of its machinery or ensured that its machinery met the standard recommended by the Council, the defendant had fallen short of the requisite standard of safety, which, by his duty of care which he owed to the plaintiff, his employee, he ought to have provided. I therefore considered the defendant to have breached its duty of care.

45     It went without saying that this breach had caused the injuries that the plaintiff suffered.

### Issue 3: Whether the plaintiff was contributorily negligent for his own injuries.

46     In having found the defendant liable for the plaintiff’s injuries, section 3(1) of the Contributory Negligence and Personal Injuries Act (Cap 54, 2002 Rev Ed) was invoked and the issue arose as to whether “the damages recoverable in respect thereof \[should\] be reduced to such extent as the court \[thought\] just and equitable having regard to the claimant’s share in the responsibility for the damage”.[^35]

#### The plaintiff’s skills level

47     Relevant to this issue was the expertise of the plaintiff. It is the defendant’s case that the plaintiff was employed as a “supervisor-cum-carpenter”. It was the plaintiff’s position that he was a mere employee. References were made to his credentials. The extent of the defendant’s duty of care is reduced if the plaintiff was expected to have acquired a certain level of competency. Hence, the relevance.

48     For the present case, there are documents to evidence the plaintiff’s having gone through a Supervisor’s Safety Course through V-Safe Training Consultant Pte Ltd. The plaintiff was therefore expected to have acquired a certain level of competency regarding safety.

49     However, the plaintiff’s testimony was that the course was a sham in that it was conducted in English which he didn't understand,[^36] they were fed the answers to the examination questions,[^37] and what was supposed to be a six day course only ran for one day.[^38] There was also the accusation that the defendant was in cahoots with the trainer, with the common objective of just letting the plaintiff go through the motion of being present at the course, then get the requisite certification. However, I would have to agree with defendant’s counsel that the plaintiff had little or nothing very much to show for that.

#### The plaintiff’s position in the company

50     Perhaps the more crucial point was the plaintiff’s designation – whether he was a mere carpenter or a supervisor. If he were the latter, a higher standard of safety would be imputed on the plaintiff as he would be taken to have known and be expected to observe safety standards.

51     On this point, it was the court’s finding that there was nothing in evidence to show that the plaintiff was employed as supervisor cum carpenter. He was even taking instructions from Mr Liew Kok Lai who was undoubtedly _the_ supervisor in the defendant-company. This was not disputed by the defendant. On the day of the accident, the plaintiff was in fact taking instructions from Mr Liew.

#### The plaintiff’s work experience and familiarity with the cutting saw

52     However, even if the plaintiff was not a supervisor in the company, the fact was that he had been in the employment of the defendant-company for about a year before the accident happened. The plaintiff in fact deposed that he had been using the cutting saw since he started working at the defendant’s.[^39] If there still lingered any doubt that the plaintiff could be working there for a year and still not be familiar with operating the cutting saw, this must be put to rest:[^40]

> Q    Maybe as an estimate, how many times have you use \[(_sic_)\] this machine prior to the accident?

> A    I use \[(_sic_)\] this every day.

53     The cutting saw was therefore a machine that was not strange to the plaintiff. It was also noteworthy that despite having used this machine since the beginning of his employment, the plaintiff had – thankfully – not had any mishaps with it.

#### The plaintiff’s personal problem

54     During cross-examination, the plaintiff volunteered information that for a period before the day of the accident, he had “a fight with \[his\] wife”.[^41] He therefore “wasn’t very focused working”.[^42]

#### The plank on the floor

55     There was also the issue of a plank or plywood on the floor. According to the plaintiff, the dimensions of this piece of wood was 70 to 80cm by 40 to 50cm.[^43] Given the size of this piece of plywood on the floor, surely it could not have been missed _but for_ the plaintiff’s being absorbed in his personal domestic issue. The plaintiff testified that he only saw the plank on the floor after the accident.[^44] The plaintiff in fact admitted that he did not check the area on 23 May 2016:[^45]

> Q    And before you start using this machine, don’t you need to check the surrounding area, including the floor right in front of the machine?

> A    Well, in theory, yes. But at the time of the accident, I had a fight with my wife, so for a couple of days, I wasn’t very focused working.

> Q    And---but of course, if you are walking to the machine before you used and you noticed that the plywood was there, would you have removed it?

> A    I did not see it.

> Q    No, but if you had seen it, would you have removed it? Would it have affected your work?

> A    If I see it, I will remove it.

> Q    Okay. Because it will affect your work.

> A    Yes.

> Q    Okay. In what way will it affect your work?

> A    Because if I step on it, I might just slip.

> Q    Okay. And on that day of the accident, you say that you didn’t notice this plywood on the floor?

> A    Yes.

56     Mr Lim Kim Ping, the director of the defendant company, also deposed in his affidavit that clearing the work area was the plaintiff’s daily task before they close for the night.[^46] The plaintiff did not challenge this. Noting that the accident took place on the morning of 23 May 2016, at about 9.05am, which was shortly after work started at 8am, quite obviously, the area was not sufficiently cleared or cleaned up the evening before. When he was cross-examined, the plaintiff explained why the plank was there and even suggested that he might have been careless in not clearing it the evening before:[^47]

> Q    And do you know why was this plywood there?

> A    Well, this is just what I am guessing because we would spray paint these door panels and sometimes we will use these big pieces of plywood to place them on the floor first before placing the door panels on top of it and start spray painting. So, sometimes, we also use the smaller pieces of plywood to put underneath this door frame---door frames or door panels before we spray paint them. _And when we keep them away, sometimes we do not do a very good job in keeping them away._ And when we do our housekeeping, we only blow or vacuum these places only and that could be one of the reason\[s\] why this plywood piece was in there. (Italics added.)

57     It was also significant that the plaintiff confirmed that the plank being where it was could not have just happened on the morning of 23 May 2016. In response to defendant’s counsel’s question of whether anyone was doing spray painting work that morning, the plaintiff had responded, “No, there wasn’t anyone doing spray painting works on that day.”[^48]

58     Given that it was the plaintiff’s own testimony that he had stepped on a plywood, which plywood should have been cleared off the evening before, and slipped, thereby resulting in the accident, the plaintiff could not be absolutely absolved from any blameworthiness for his own injuries.

#### A combination of factors

59     The plaintiff’s unfinished task of the evening before with littered flooring which could cause trips or slips, his being distracted by his domestic issue with his wife, his choosing to operate a cutting saw, all made for a perfect setting for disaster.

60     As earlier mentioned, the plaintiff must be apportioned some liability for his contributing to his own injuries. What then would be an equitable apportionment?

#### The apportionment of liabilities

61     The plaintiff’s co-worker testified that there was no problem working with the plaintiff, and that he had initiative.[^49] It was easy to surmise that that was what might have prompted the plaintiff to go to the cutting saw to saw a wedge for his use later during the installation. The plaintiff testified that Mr Liew (supervisor) himself was at another machine and the plaintiff would therefore rather not be seen with nothing to do as he would otherwise “definitely be scolded”.[^50] The plaintiff therefore exercised his initiative to do what he might have considered at that time, something useful. Of course when the accident happened, the defendant had turned around and intimated that it gave no such directions or instructions and the plaintiff should have just waited to move off to the installation site, since loading was already done.

62     In _Parno v SC Marine Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] SGCA 69</span>[^51] (“_Parno_’s case”) (at \[45\]-\[46\]),[^52] Justice Chao Hick Tin stated:

>     … The employer must devise a suitable system and instruct his men in what they must do: see _Pape v Cumbria County Council_ \[1992\] 3 All ER 211. In devising a safe system, the employer should be aware that workmen are often careless for their own safety, and his system must, _as far as possible_, reduce the effects of an employee’s own carelessness: see _General Cleaning Contractors Ltd v Christmas_ <span class="citation">\[1953\] AC 180</span> at pp1890190 per Lord Reid.

While it was acknowledged that the plaintiff could have taken more care or given due attention when operating a dangerous machine, as earlier held, in not meeting the requisite standard of care, the defendant must be apportioned the greater liability. How much greater a liability? Conversely, this court considered what was the liability to be apportioned to the plaintiff.

63     In _Parno_’s case where the accident happened on a dumb barge, the plaintiff was apportioned one-third liability and his employer two-thirds. In apportioning thus, the Court of Appeal there considered that the defendant had failed in their duty of care to the plaintiff in not providing, _inter alia_, a proper system of work and effective supervision of its employee.

64     However, it appears that there might also have been some sympathy toward the plaintiff in that case. The Court of Appeal pointed out that the accident happened at 5pm when the worker had been working since 6am; referred to his careless act as “a momentary lapse” (at \[66\][^53]); and took into account his inexperience since he had never worked on a piling barge prior to the accident and had only been at the job one and a half weeks at the time of the accident (at \[68\][^54]). Even the act which resulted in the accident – to replace a pin in the hammer of the pile-driving operation – was mentioned in the context of “as \[the plaintiff\] was concerned for the safety of the entire piling operation” (at \[68\][^55]). The Court of Appeal in that case was also cognisant that “it might not have been part of the appellant’s duty to replace a loose pin number 16” (at \[67\][^56]). Taking all these into consideration, the Court of Appeal nevertheless imputed one-third contributory negligence on the plaintiff for his own injuries.

65     Taking reference from _Parno_’s case, and considering the circumstances of the present case, it was only equitable that the plaintiff in our present case likewise bear one-third liability for his injuries. The plaintiff here also did an act which might not have been required of him, but from his sense of wanting to be useful and exercising his initiative, but unfortunately an accident happened. Unlike the plaintiff in _Parno_’s case, the plaintiff here had greater experience in what he was doing when the accident happened. He was doing a familiar work and, at a machine that he was familiar with. This must be contrasted with the plaintiff in _Parno_’s case. There is also no evidence and it could not reasonably be conjectured that our plaintiff might have been weary, since the work day had just started half an hour ago before the accident took place. Again the facts are distinguishable from _Parno_’s case in this aspect. Further, the plaintiff had admitted himself that he was distracted or could not focus due to his personal troubles.

66     The condition of the premises which contributed to the accident was also attributable to the plaintiff’s not having performed his chore well the day before.

67     All things considered, it was equitable that the plaintiff be ordered to bear one-third liability for his own injuries, and nothing lesser than what the plaintiff in _Parno_’s case was ordered to bear. Hence, it was this court’s determination that the damages recoverable from the defendant be reduced by one-third.

## CONCLUSION AND COST ORDERS

68     Given the above findings, interlocutory judgment was made in the plaintiff’s favour to the extent of two-thirds of the damages to be assessed, with costs of this trial and disbursements to be agreed between the parties. The Court further ordered that if the parties were unable to agree on costs and disbursements, the plaintiff was to make application for costs of this trial to be fixed by me after the assessment of damages hearing.

69     The plaintiff has appealed against this whole decision.
