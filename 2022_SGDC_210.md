\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9040/2022/01.\]

31 October 2022

### District Judge Ronald Gwee:

1       The Accused, Alan Tan Boon Kiat (“Tan”), was first charged in Court on 23 November 2019, having committed three drug-related offences. These three offences were committed on or around 21 November 2019. After initial periods of remand (separately) for purposes of investigations and for psychiatric evaluation, Tan was released on Bail.

2       Whilst Tan was on Bail, he went on to commit further, and more serious drug-related offences. These fresh offences formed the basis of nine further Charges faced by Tan, and were committed on or around 9 September 2020. The time lapse between the commission of both sets of offences was a period of less than 10 months. The offences committed in November 2019 will hereafter be referred to as the “First Set of Offences”, and the offences committed in September 2020 will hereafter be referred to as the “Second Set of Offences”.

3       Tan faced a total of 12 Charges. Tan pleaded guilty before me to four proceeded Charges. The other nine Charges were to be taken into consideration (“TIC”) for purposes of sentencing. Tan admitted to these Charges and consented to their being taken into consideration as aforesaid. Of the four proceeded Charges Tan pleaded guilty to, two were offences from the First Set of Offences, and two were offences from the Second Set of Offences. Tan admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification.

4       As Tan had committed all these offences whilst he was on remission for his previous sentences, he was also liable to be additionally punished under s 50T of the Prisons Act. The maximum (cumulative) enhanced sentence Tan faced was imprisonment for a total of 459 days.

5       Tan was represented by Counsel. Counsel’s submission on sentence at the outset was not too different from that of the Prosecution’s, in terms of the totality of the sentence to be meted out. During further oral submissions on sentence, the Defence’s stance was modified to reach a total sentence which was lower compared to the initial position taken by the Defence. This will be illustrated later.

6       After Tan was sentenced, Defence filed an appeal against sentence. Tan is currently serving sentence.

7       The Table below gives a quick overview of the four proceeded Charges, and the salient points relating to these Charges. The term “Enhanced Possession” refers to the offences Tan committed where he had in his possession, Class A controlled drugs without authorisation. As Tan had previously committed a similar offence of unauthorised possession of a controlled drug, he was facing a mandatory minimum imprisonment sentence of two years for each such Charge. The term “LT1” refers to the offence of the consumption of a specified drug without authorisation, where there had been two relevant antecedents. Such an offence is punishable by a mandatory minimum sentence of five years’ imprisonment and a mandatory minimum 3 strokes of the cane. We come to the offence denoted as “Enhanced Trafficking”. The discussion for this Charge will be the most detailed. “Enhanced Trafficking” refers to Tan having trafficked in a Class A controlled drug by having in his possession for the purpose of trafficking that said drug, without authorisation; and in a situation where Tan had previously committed a similar offence. For the “Enhanced Trafficking” Charge, Tan would be punished with a mandatory minimum imprisonment sentence of 10 years and a mandatory minimum 10 strokes of the cane. The Table also shows the Prosecution’s submission on the enhanced sentences to be imposed pursuant to s 50T of the Prisons Act. (The Defence did not make any submission on the issue of the enhanced sentences to be meted out and left these to the Court to decide.)

8       The Table in \[7\] also indicates the sentences the Prosecution and the Defence (initially) had submitted, should run consecutively (in bold). We will return to the issue of the enhanced sentences later (bearing in mind that the Defence had made no submission on this, and had left this area of sentencing to the Court to decide). Tan was heavily traced with drug-related antecedents, and this led to the need to impose the mandatory minimum sentences as indicated in the Table in \[7\].

9       From the Table in \[7\], it can be seen that the Prosecution was seeking a total sentence (before counting the enhanced sentences) of **20 to 23 years’ imprisonment and 15 to 17 strokes of the cane**. The initial stand of the Defence was to submit for a total sentence (not counting the enhanced sentences) of **20 years’ imprisonment and 14 strokes of the cane**. At this initial stage, the respective positions on sentence were not too far apart.

10     I found the Prosecution’s submission to run the sentences for the Enhanced Trafficking Charge and the (First) Enhanced Possession Charge to be reasonable and fair (bearing in mind that the indicative sentence for the (First) Enhanced Possession Charge was the lowest of the four sentences to be meted out, and was pegged at the mandatory minimum sentence of two years’ imprisonment). When the Defence realised that the Prosecution was not seeking to run the sentence for the LT1 Charge consecutively, the stance of the Defence changed. The Defence similarly sought for the sentence for the (First) Enhanced Possession (and not the LT1 sentence) to run consecutively. Therefore the revised Defence stand was for a total sentence of **17 years’ imprisonment** (15 years plus two years) **and 14 strokes of the cane**. The Defence’s stand was further modified; we shall return to this later.

11     During oral submissions on sentence, the learned DPP pointed out that \[13\] of the Mitigation Plea was not consonant with the SOF. The Defence had claimed in the Mitigation Plea that some of the drugs relating to the Enhanced Trafficking Charge were meant for Tan’s “personal consumption”. It was clear from the SOF that all the drugs seized (and relating to the Enhanced Trafficking Charge) from Tan were meant to be trafficked. The Defence finally agreed with the scenario painted by the SOF and sought to withdraw that part of the Mitigation that pleaded that some of the said drugs were for “personal consumption”.

12     Therefore, in terms of the total sentence to be imposed (other than the consideration for the enhanced sentences), the difference between the Prosecution and the Defence revolved around the appropriate sentence to be imposed for the Enhanced Trafficking Charge.

13     To arrive at its submission of **18 to 21 years’ imprisonment and 12 to 14 strokes of the cane**, the Prosecution relied on _PP v Lai Teck Guan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 852</span> (“_Lai Teck Guan_”), and _Loo Pei Xiang Alan v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 500</span> (“_Loo Pei Xiang Alan_”).

14     In the case of _Lai Teck Guan_ the Honourable Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon set out the indicative uplift sentences for repeat trafficking offences (at \[42\], for trafficking of diamorphine).

15     As indicated in _Loo Pei Xiang Alan_ (per Chao Hick Tin JA) at \[17\], the “culpability of an offender who traffics one gram of diamorphine is equivalent to the culpability of an identically-situated offender who traffics 16.7g of methamphetamine”.

16     In respect of the Enhanced Trafficking Charge, Tan had been found in (unauthorised) possession for the purpose of trafficking, a total of 166.9g of methamphetamine. Applying the diamorphine/methamphetamine calculation set out in _Loo Pei Xiang Alan_, this weight would have placed Tan in the same sentencing consideration band as “9 – 9.99g of diamorphine” from \[42\] of _Lai Teck Guan_. Adopting and modifying the Table from _Lai Teck Guan_ for the amount trafficked by Tan would place him thus:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="35.94%"><col width="31.86%"><col width="32.2%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Weight of methamphetamine</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Starting sentence (first-time offender)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Indicative uplift</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(Approximately)</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">150.3 – 166.83g</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(equivalent to “9-9.99g diamorphine”)</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">13-15 years</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">10-11 strokes</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3-6 years</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2-3 strokes</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

17     Although the weight of methamphetamine that Tan trafficked was 166.9g and appears at first blush to be outside this range, it must be noted that the next weight range for diamorphine as per _Lai Teck Guan_ would start at “10g” of diamorphine (equivalent of 167g of methamphetamine, and this would take us into further consideration of other matters which would not be relevant here, where we are considering a quantity just below this threshold weight). It would thus be fair to consider Tan to have trafficked in an amount just short of 167g and have regard to the range set out in \[16\] above.

18     With regard to the sentence for the Enhanced Trafficking Charge, the Prosecution stated that the starting point was 13 to 15 years’ imprisonment and 10 to 11 strokes of the cane (as per _Lai Teck Guan_ and _Loo Pei Xiang Alan_). Then the Prosecution pointed to the fact that 166.9g of methamphetamine was at the “uppermost end of this range” and hence submitted that the “appropriate” staring point would be 14 to 15 years’ imprisonment and 10 to 11 strokes of the cane. Next, the Prosecution (pointing to the “indicative uplift for … a repeat offender” being 3 to 6 years’ imprisonment and 2 to 3 strokes of the cane) submitted that as Tan had re-offended whilst on Bail “by again committing drug offences”, that “the appropriate uplift is 4 to 6 years’ imprisonment with 2 to 3 strokes of the cane”. Hence, the Prosecution’s submission for the Enhanced Trafficking Charge was for a sentence of **18 to 21 years’ imprisonment and 12 to 14 strokes of the cane**. At the outset, it would appear that the Prosecution’s approach was very fair and reasonable in the circumstances.

19     The Defence’s initial sentence submission for the Enhanced Trafficking Charge was **15 years’ imprisonment and 11 strokes of the cane**. During oral submissions on sentence, the learned Defence Counsel agreed (bearing in mind the weight of the drugs) with the Prosecution that the “starting point” would be 14 to 15 years. The Defence submitted that in Tan’s case, the starting point should be calibrated at 14 years. The Defence then submitted that the uplift should be 2.5 to 3 years. Therefore, the final submission by the Defence for the Enhanced Trafficking Charge would be **16.5 to 17 years’ imprisonment and 11 strokes of the cane**.

20     I could not agree with the position put forth by the Defence. I considered the Mitigating factors, and found nothing exceptional or substantively sufficient to depart from the carefully calibrated position put forth by the Prosecution. The Defence submission of an uplift of only 2.5 to 3 years was inadequate in the circumstances. The uplift indicated in _Lai Teck Guan_ was 3 to 6 years. I had to bear in mind that the weight of methamphetamine trafficked by Tan was at the higher end of that particular scale.

21     It was also clear that committing the Enhanced Trafficking offence whilst on Bail was highly aggravating in the circumstances. It also had to be borne in mind that there were three other trafficking Charges (all committed at the stage of the Second Set of Offences) each carrying mandatory minimum sentences of 10 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane, to be TIC. These three TIC Charges were for trafficking different types of drugs: amphetamine, ketamine and cannabis mixture. This, again, was particularly aggravating.

22     There were two other possession Charges (offences also from the second Set of Offences) to be TIC, and each carried mandatory minimum sentences of two years’ imprisonment. Tan also committed another LT1 offence as part of the Second Set of Offences, and this was also to be TIC. The two remaining Charges that were to be TIC were for possession of drug utensils (once during the First Set of Offences and another during the Second Set of Offences).

23     For the enhanced sentences pursuant to s 50T of the Prisons Act, the Defence did not make any submissions. I agreed with the stand taken by the Prosecution, citing _Abdul Mutalib Bin Aziman v PP and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 4 SLR 1220</span>. As the maximum length of the enhanced sentences (in total) for the present case was 459 days, the Prosecution had submitted for enhanced sentences in the ranges as set out in the Table at \[7\] above, and pegged the total enhanced sentence at the maximum of 459 days. Tan had been on remission for drug-related offences.

24     All considered, I was of the view that the mandatory minimum sentences ought to be meted out for the LT1 Offence (5 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane) and the First Enhanced Possession Offence (2 years’ imprisonment). An uplift for the Second Enhanced Possession Offence was appropriate, as this was a “repeated” offence, and was committed whilst Tan was on Bail. Hence, an imprisonment term of 2 years and 6 months would be appropriate.

25     As for the Enhanced Trafficking Charge, taking into account all the relevant circumstances, and with an eye on the very aggravating factors present, as discussed above, I was of the view that the starting points of 14 years and an uplift starting point of 4 years (for a repeat offender) as proposed by the Prosecution was very fair and reasonable. Taking into account especially the aggravating factors present, I was of the view that a provisional landing point of 18 years and 7 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate. This is lenient when compared to the range of 18 to 21 years’ imprisonment sought by the Prosecution, and for which I found was reasonable and justifiable. From this provisional 18 years and 7 months, I would further deduct one month (to arrive at a final 18 years and 6 months) to account for an earlier period Tan was held in remand (after his first arrest).

26     As a further measure of leniency accorded to Tan, I pegged the caning sentence for the Enhanced Trafficking Charge at only 11 strokes (thereby “discounting” the indicative uplift of the caning sentence of 2 to 3 strokes). The sentences for only the Enhanced Trafficking Charge and the First Enhanced Possession Charge were ordered to run consecutively, and were “backdated” to the date of his second arrest on 9 September 2020. The imprisonment sentences for the LT1 offence (5 years) and the Second Enhanced Possession Charge (2 years and 6 months) were ordered to run concurrently. The enhanced sentences (pursuant to the Prisons Act), by Law, run consecutively.

27     Thus, Tan was sentenced as follows:

28     The total sentence was therefore imprisonment for a total term of 20 years and 6 months, 14 strokes of the cane, and a total enhanced sentence (pursuant to the Prisons Act) of 450 days’ imprisonment. Sentence was backdated to 9 September 2020. Tan appealed against the sentence imposed and is currently serving sentence.

29     As the total sentence would be long, I took extra care in my exercise of having the “Last Look” before the sentences were meted out. As demonstrated above, although the Prosecution’s submission of the upper limits of sentence for the Enhanced Trafficking Charge (21 years’ imprisonment and 14 strokes of the cane) was justifiable in the circumstances, I calibrated the sentence for this offence at 18 years and 6 months’ imprisonment and 11 strokes of the cane. It had to be borne in mind that the amount trafficked was substantial and that Tan had committed this offence (and several other serious drug-related offences) whilst he was on Bail. I carefully considered the Totality of the sentence to be meted out to Tan. I was of the view that the final sentence was justified (and as shown above, was on the lenient side). It could not be said that the sentences meted out (and the final, total sentence) were crushing or excessive.
