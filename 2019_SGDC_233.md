\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in DCA 31 of 2019.\]

1 November 2019

### District Judge Lim Wee Ming:

The Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendants is for injuries suffered by the Plaintiff arising from an accident at a construction site at Sembawang Crescent, where the 1st Defendant was the Plaintiff’s employer and the 2nd Defendant was the occupier of the construction site. I dismissed the Plaintiff’s claim. The Plaintiff has appealed against my decision.

## Facts

2       The Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendants is in negligence and breach of statutory duty, for injuries suffered by the Plaintiff arising from an accident on 24 February 2016, wherein the Plaintiff fell while he was walking at a construction site at Sembawang Crescent (“the Premises”). The 2nd Defendant was the occupier of the Premises and the main contractor for a project (“the Project”) to construct a condominium at the Premises. The 1st Defendant was engaged by the 2nd Defendant to carry out structural works for the Project. The Plaintiff was employed by the 1st Defendant.

3       According to the Plaintiff, at about 11:35 am, he was walking along an access route on the Premises, when his sleeve became entangled with a formwork screw protruding out from a scaffold located along the access route, which caused him to fall and injure himself. The Plaintiff claims that formwork screws were used to secure the scaffolding on either side of the access route.

4       The Defendant’s version of the accident was that the Plaintiff had departed from the access route and had stepped over a safety net in order to take a short cut. In the process, he tripped over the net and fell.

5       It is not disputed that the accident occurred at a path leading straight through the falsework area to reach a store. What is disputed is whether this path was accessible and allowed to be used by workers or was screened by a safety net, which the Plaintiff had stepped over (see paragraph 25 of the Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions).

6       A key witness who gave evidence for the 1st Defendant was Zhao Dan, a co-worker of the Plaintiff. The evidence of Zhao Dan was that he saw the Plaintiff step over the safety netting and fell when his leg was caught on the safety netting (see affidavit of evidence-in-chief \[“AEIC”\] of Zhao Dan at \[13\]). As Zhao Dan was leaving Singapore, his evidence was given before a Deputy Registrar on 29 December 2017, prior to the trial. All the other witnesses gave evidence at the trial.

## Decision

7       The case essentially turns on whether I believe the Plaintiff’s evidence that his sleeve became entangled on a formwork screw protruding into the access route or Zhao Dan’s evidence that he saw the Plaintiff step over the safety netting.

##### Plaintiff’s statement and 1st Defendant’s reports

8       The 1st Defendant’s site manager, Sun Dang Shun, had taken a statement from the Plaintiff after the accident (see paragraph 14 of Sun Dang Shun’s AEIC). The Plaintiff wrote the statement and thereafter, Sun Dang Shun took a photograph of the statement \[Bundle of Affidavits of Evidence-in-Chief (“BAEIC”) at pages 268-269\]. In his statement, the Plaintiff merely stated that he “_tripped and fell down_”. There was no mention that his fall was caused by his sleeve getting entangled with a formwork screw. The Plaintiff claimed that he wrote and signed the statement even though the contents were inaccurate, as he was told that he would not be able to claim compensation unless he signed the statement (Plaintiff’s AEIC at \[19\]).

9       On the part of the 1st Defendant, it had:

> a.     lodged an Incident Report of the accident with the Ministry of Manpower \[Volume 2 of the Agreed Bundle (“AB”) at pages 39-42\],

> b.     prepared an Incident/Accident Investigation Report to its Managing Director (2AB43-45), and

> c.     completed a Corrective Action Report (2AB46).

10     None of the aforesaid reports of the 1st Defendant, mentioned that the Plaintiff’s fall was caused by the Plaintiff taking a shortcut.

11     As neither the Plaintiff’s statement, nor the 1st Defendant’s reports, supported either party’s account of the accident, I am of the view that the Plaintiff’s statement and the 1st Defendant’s reports were not particularly helpful in assisting the Court to decide whose version of the accident was more credible.

##### Photographs of the access route

12     In support of the Plaintiff’s case, the Plaintiff relied on photographs adduced by the 1st Defendant of the access route. The photographs of the access route do not show the safety netting alleged by the Defendants. However, the 1st Defendant’s position is that the safety netting was removed after the accident.

13     The 1st Defendant’s site manager, Sun Dang Shun, took the photographs and explained that:

> “_by the time I took the photograph, the safety netting had been removed from one side of the access route because, as I recall, the 1_st_Defendant was preparing to dismantle the formworks and falseworks at the Falsework Area. In this regard, dismantling of the slab formworks and falseworks would usually commence after the minimum 7-day period from the casting of the concrete. … the slab over these areas was cast on 18 February 2016. The date that the photographs were taken (i.e. 25 or 26 February 2016) is around the period when the dismantling would have commenced_” (Sun Dang Sun’s AEIC at \[27\]).

14     The 1st Defendant’s safety supervisor, Ghosh Chandan Kumer (“Kumer”), also gave evidence that “_the formworks and falseworks at \[the relevant area\] were dismantled shortly after the accident, and that the safety netting would have been taken down in preparation for the dismantling_” (Kumer’s AEIC at \[27\]). Kumer made no mention in his AEIC on the time to dismantle the formwork and falsework after casting.

15     In cross-examination, Kumer claimed that the time for dismantling the formwork and falsework would be 15 days after casting \[see Notes of Evidence (“NE”) of 8 May at pages 75-76\], contrary to Sun Dang Sun’s AEIC that it would only take 7 days (see paragraph 13 above). The Plaintiff has submitted that the 1st Defendant could not have been preparing to dismantle the formwork and falsework, because the casting would not have been dry at that time, based on Kumer’s evidence of 15 days (paragraphs 33 and 34 of the Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions).

16     However, Sun Dang Shun was not cross-examined on his evidence that the dismantling of formwork and falsework would be 7 days after casting, even though he specifically addressed this point in his AEIC. This was despite counsel for the Plaintiff having had ample opportunity to do so, as Sun Dang Shun was first cross-examined on 21 March, followed by further cross-examination on 8 May 2019. In the premises, I am more inclined to accept the evidence of Sun Dang Shun, rather than Kumer’s evidence in this regard.

##### Exchange of WeChat messages

17     In an exchange of WeChat messages between Zhao Dan and the Plaintiff, Zhao Dan referred to the Plaintiff crossing the mesh wire screen. The Plaintiff in his WeChat reply, did not dispute this, but merely maintained that he did not tear down the screen (2AB136-138).

18     In cross-examination, the Plaintiff claimed that he “_was slow in texting_”, as his excuse for not disputing this in his WeChat reply (19 March NE25). I am not inclined to believe that, as the Plaintiff did take the trouble to repeatedly deal with whether the screen was torn (2AB137-138). If there was no screen at all, as the Plaintiff now alleges, it would be easier for him to have said so in his WeChat reply, rather than stating “_I didn’t tear down the screen_” (2AB137) and “_I’m just worried that Sun might find someone who says that I tear down the screen_” (2AB138).

19     In the premises, I find on the balance of the probabilities that the Plaintiff fell when he tripped while stepping over the safety netting.

##### Other workers taking the shortcut

20     The Plaintiff has referred to Zhao Dan’s evidence that he had taken the shortcut himself on multiple occasions when workers in front of him had unfastened the safety netting (paragraph 52 of the Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions). Sun Liyong and Zhao Subiao, who were other co-workers of the Plaintiff, also gave evidence that they had taken the shortcut before.

21     However, the Plaintiff’s pleaded case is that the Defendants failed to take reasonable care to ensure that all means of access was safe \[see paragraphs 10.6 and 10.10 of the Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1)\]. It is not pleaded that the Defendants failed to take reasonable care to prevent workers from unfastening and climbing over the netting.

22     In _Parno v SC Marine_ \[1999\] 3 SLR (R) 377, the Court of Appeal held that:

> “_In devising a safe system, the employer should be aware that workmen are often careless for their own safety, and his system must, as far as possible, reduce the effects of an employee’s own carelessness … The employer must also take reasonable care to ensure that his system is complied with, but he is not obliged … to stand over workmen of age and experience at every moment they are working … to see that they do what they are supposed to do_” \[46\].

23     In the present case, the 1st Defendant had put up safety netting along the access route. The Plaintiff fell when he deliberately circumvented the 1st Defendant’s safety system, by stepping over the safety netting. It was the Plaintiff’s act of stepping over the safety netting that caused his fall, rather than any failure by the 1st Defendant to ensure that the means of access was safe.

24     In the premises, the Plaintiff’s claim is dismissed with costs.
