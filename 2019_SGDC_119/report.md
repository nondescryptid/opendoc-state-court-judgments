### District Judge John Ng:

## The Undisputed Facts

1       On 25 August 2017, as reflected in the Statement of Agreed Facts, the mother of the 16-year-old victim discovered messages in her daughter’s mobile phone which revealed that she had provided sexual services to men. The victim’s parents immediately brought her to a police station and a report was lodged. Investigations by the police revealed that the victim had been advertising her sexual services from end July to early August 2017 on Locanto, a Web-based classifieds network. She had downloaded the Locanto App onto her mobile phone and set up her Locanto account. She created posts with this account on Locanto, advertising her sexual services such as “handjob” (masturbation) and “blowjob” (fellatio) but not sexual intercourse.

2       The Accused, aged 40 years old at that time, had sent messages to the victim’s Locanto account on 1 August 2017 stating that he was keen on her services and that he was willing to be her “sugar daddy”. In the course of their communications between 1st and 13th August 2017, the Accused found out that the victim was 16 years old. She had also sent to the Accused her photos, including a picture of her in the nude specifically upon his request. The Accused had also asked the victim if she was willing to have sexual intercourse with him for $500. The victim was not agreeable.

3       The Accused asked several times to meet the victim, as seen from the retrieved Locanto chat messages. She finally agreed to meet him. They arranged for the Accused to pick her up near her home and send her to Alexandra Road, near where she was scheduled to have her tuition. As arranged, on a day in August 2017, in the afternoon between 4.30pm and 5.30pm, the Accused picked her up at Jurong West and drove to Alexandra Road in his car. Upon reaching the IKEA Building at Alexandra Road, instead of letting her down at the drop-off point of the building, the Accused drove the victim to the basement carpark. At the basement carpark, the Accused “French kissed” (kissing involving the tongue) the victim. While doing so, he unbuttoned the victim’s shorts and sexually penetrated her vagina with his finger. The victim told him that she was late for her tuition. The Accused asked the victim if she had money to eat. The victim said she had. Nevertheless, the Accused gave her $50.

4       Subsequently, arising from investigations by the police into the report lodged as mentioned above, the Accused was arrested on 27 September 2017 for an offence of commercial sex with a minor and initially charged as follows:

> “Sometime in early August 2017, between 4.30pm and 5.00pm, at No. 317 Alexandra Road, IKEA Alexandra basement carpark, Singapore, did obtain for consideration the sexual services of \[**_name of victim redacted_**\] (female / 03/08/2001), who was under the age of 18 years, _to wit_, by sexually penetrating her vagina with your finger and giving her a sum of S$50 thereafter, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 376B(1) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Rev. Ed.)”

## The Prosecution’s case

5       Just before the start of the trial, the Prosecution tendered an amended charge for an offence of attempting to obtain for consideration the sexual services of a person under 18 years of age (DAC 944069/2017) as follows:

> “Sometime in August 2017, in Singapore, did attempt to obtain for consideration the sexual services of \[**_name of victim redacted_**\] (female / 03/08/2001), a person under 18 years of age, _to wit_, by:

>> (a)    sending messages to her on Locanto and WeChat in August 2017 to obtain for consideration her sexual services; and

>> (b)    meeting her in August 2017 at Jurong West and driving her to Alexandra Road, Singapore, to discuss the sexual services that she was willing to provide for consideration;

> and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 376B(1) read with Section 511(1) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Rev. Ed.)”

6       This amendment to the offence of attempt was necessitated by the undisputed fact that the digital penetration of the victim by the Accused at the basement carpark was not a sexual service provided by the victim for consideration of the $50 given by the Accused to her after the act. Therefore, the Prosecution proceeded on a charge of Attempt particularised by the sending of messages to obtain sexual services and meeting up and discussing in the car the sexual services she was willing to provide for consideration.

7       The Accused was convicted of the amended charge of Attempt after a trial. He was sentenced on 10 April 2019 to an imprisonment term of 3 months and decided to start his sentence from that date. His Counsel had filed an appeal against Conviction on 22 April 2019 but made no application for bail pending appeal. The Accused has completed his sentence and was released from prison on 10 June 2019.

8       This Court is acutely aware that the discretion is vested fully in the Prosecution to decide which offence to charge an accused person. In this case, the Prosecution decided to proceed on a charge of Attempt and this Court was given to understand that this was the first time such a prosecution for an attempt under Section 376B(1) read with Section 511(1) of the Penal Code (“PC”) is being conducted. Nevertheless, it could not escape the attention of this Court that there is provided under Section 376B(2) PC, an offence of “communicating with another person for the purpose of obtaining for consideration, the sexual services of a person who is under 18 years of age”. In my view, based on the undisputed facts in this case, the Accused could have been convicted of the offence under Section 376B(2) PC, had he been charged with it. Since, the Prosecution had exercised its unfettered discretion to proceed on the offence of Attempt, I need say no more on this at this stage.

9       The only witness called by the Prosecution was the victim.

## The Defence’s case

10     The challenge mounted by the Defence against the amended charge of Attempt is that the Accused had not gone far enough to warrant a conviction of the charge of attempting to obtain for consideration sexual services from the victim.

11     The Accused had only intended to be a ‘sugar daddy’ to the victim which meant paying her in return for her companionship. Such companionship would only involve having coffee, meals and watching movies together.

12     The Defence Counsel submitted that the offence of attempt in this case would only have been committed if the Accused and the victim had mutually come to an agreement on the sum for sexual services and the Accused had completed transferring in whole or in part the agreed sum to the victim.

13     The Defence Counsel stated at Paragraph 104 of the Defence Closing Submissions: “…that the said person had neither embarked on the crime proper nor had progressed a substantial way towards the completion of the offence since (i) they had not established a mutual agreement; and (ii) he had not transferred in whole or in part of any agreed consideration to her.” Therefore, the Defence Counsel put forth the argument that since these conditions have not been met, there was insufficient _actus reus_ for constituting a criminal attempt of the offence.

## Evaluation of the case

14     Whether an attempt had been made to commit an offence depends on the type of offence in question. In the present case, the Prosecution had particularised the elements of the Attempt as:

> (a)     sending messages to her on Locanto and WeChat in August 2017 to obtain for consideration her sexual services; and

> (b)     meeting her in August 2017 at Jurong West and driving her to Alexandra Road, Singapore, to discuss the sexual services that she was willing to provide for consideration.

15     The particulars under (a) are not in dispute. The particulars under (b) are disputed in so far as the Accused denied discussing the sexual services that the victim was willing to provide for consideration while they were in the car.

16     Before we can proceed to consider whether the particularisation of the amended charge would be sufficient to constitute the offence of attempting to obtain for consideration the sexual services of the victim, a person under 18 years of age, the question of whether the particulars under (b) have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt has to be answered.

### The Victim’s testimony

17     The victim testified that she first got to know the Accused through communicating with him through the Locanto platform. Subsequently, they messaged each other through Locanto and WeChat. She agreed to provide sexual services such as “blowjob” and “handjob” for the Accused for between $150 and $250. He offered to pay $500 for sex but she did not accept. She said that the Accused persisted in asking to meet her and she finally relented and agreed to meet him. The Accused offered to pick her up from Jurong West and send her to Alexandra Road, near her tuition centre.

18     In the course of the journey in the car, the Accused spoke to her about his experiences with his “sugar babies” in the past. In the course of doing so, he asked her if she was willing to take up his offer of sex for $500. She did not reply as she did not know what to say or how to respond.

19     In the cross-examination of the victim by the Defence Counsel, she agreed that initially she did not advertise that she was providing sexual services but she was looking for a sugar daddy and that she would provide companionship for $5,000. Subsequently, she ventured into providing sexual services after receiving many messages asking for these services. When the Accused contacted her, he asked her what kind of services she would provide, whether she provided “handjob” and “blowjob”. He also offered her $500 for sex and these messages were reflected in the Locanto messages exchanged with her.

20     As for what had transpired in the car journey, the victim maintained that the Accused had asked if she was willing to have sex with him for $500. She did not agree to the offer but she did not give a reply. It was put to her that she did not respond because he did not ask such a question. She disagreed.

21     I found the victim clear and coherent in her responses to the questions posed by the DPP and DC during the trial. She answered directly and was able to state clearly what had happened in her communications over Locanto and her interaction with the Accused in the car. She did not seek to embellish her evidence and her answers were devoid of apparent bias. She gave her evidence plainly regardless of whether the evidence was incriminating or exculpatory to the Accused.

22     I agreed with the DPP that the victim had no reason to lie or fabricate any aspect of her evidence. It was not put to her by the Defence that she had any reason to incriminate the Accused in her evidence. Some credit could be given to the Defence Counsel for not levelling at the victim any unsubstantiated allegations of fabrication or malice on her part towards the Accused.

### The Accused’s testimony

23     The Accused elected to give evidence. The Accused testified that he responded to the victim’s post in Locanto looking for a “sugar daddy”. Although he already had a girlfriend at that time, he wanted to find a female friend to chit-chat and he also responded to the Locanto messages out of curiosity. The Accused wanted to meet the victim after telecommunicating with her as he had been “scammed” before and did not want to be “scammed” again. The Accused denied offering the victim $500 for sex while they were travelling in the car from Jurong West to Alexandra Road. The Accused said that they had only spoke about him being her “sugar daddy” and they did not discuss sex. He was driving and wanted to stay focussed on the road. They talked about going out for coffee, movies and meals and nothing really sexual. When the counsel asked him to clarify what he meant by nothing really sexual, he said that he mentioned “sugar baby things” and he did ask her if she was comfortable with just kissing and cuddling.

24     It was clear to me, even at the Examination-in-chief stage of his evidence, that the Accused was prevaricating and hesitant in his answers. It was not surprising, bearing in mind that his Locanto messages to the victim were at odds with his reticent responses explaining his behaviour. The weak aspects of his evidence became stark when he was cross-examined by the DPP.

25     The DPP was able to show that the evidence proffered by the Accused was rather telling of his true motives and ill intentions. There is no need to repeat most of what the DPP managed to do in destroying the Accused’s feeble explanations. I agree with the DPP’s cogent Closing Submissions (replete with excerpts of the Accused’s testimony) and characterisation of the Accused therein and need only highlight the following pertinent aspects to show why the Court rejected his version:

> (a)     I agree with the salient point made by the DPP that “The Locanto messages unequivocally show that the accused intended to have sexual intercourse with the victim for $500 despite knowing that she was just 16”.

> (b)     It was preposterous for the Accused to have said that he was prepared to pay the victim $500 per occasion to secure her companionship purely for coffee, movies and meals.

> (c)     The sudden detour to the basement carpark (which caught the victim by surprise) and the sexual acts that the Accused performed on the victim at the basement carpark betrayed his intentions all along to engage in sexual activity.

## Offence of Attempt Sufficiently Established

26     A plank of the Defence put forth by the Accused is that the actions taken by him were not sufficient to establish the offence of Attempt. The Defence Counsel submitted that the offence of Attempt in this case would only have been committed when the Accused and the victim had mutually come to an agreement on the sum for sexual services and the Accused had completed transferring in whole or in part the agreed sum to the victim.

27     The offence in the present case is one of attempting “to obtain” and therefore the offence is established by the Prosecution once it is proved that steps were taken, together with the intention to receive the sexual services, by the Accused to procure an agreement. There is no requirement for there to be an acceptance of the offer made by the Accused. I have accepted the evidence of PW1, which is highly consistent with the Statement of Agreed Facts and the telecommunication messages admitted and adduced at trial, that the Accused had offered to pay for sexual services, both through his messages and during the discussion in the car journey. The victim communicated to him that she was prepared to give “handjob” and “blowjob” to him for $150 to $250 and he offered to give $500 for penile-vaginal sexual intercourse. The Accused’s version of seeking only her companionship devoid of sexual acts is a mere afterthought. It is my finding that the victim’s version of what transpired in the car during the journey bore the truth of what happened and what was discussed. It is also my view, regardless of what was discussed during the car journey, that the Accused had already attempted to obtain for consideration the sexual services of the victim during the telecommunications with her on Locanto.

28     In the event that this Court is erroneous in its finding that the Prosecution had proved its case against the Accused on the amended charge and the particulars as set out by the Prosecution in the amended charge is insufficient to constitute the offence of attempting to obtain for consideration the sexual services of the 16-year-old victim, this Court would have no hesitation and would have exercised the discretion in Section 141 of the Criminal Procedure Code, Chapter 68, to convict the Accused under Section 376B(2) PC for the offence of communicating with the victim for the purpose of obtaining for consideration her sexual services. The undisputed facts disclosed in the Statement of Agreed Facts would have amply satisfied all the physical and mental elements for that offence.

## Conclusion

29     For the above reasons, I was satisfied that the single charge was proven beyond reasonable doubt and I convicted and sentenced the Accused accordingly. The sentence imposed was 3 months’ imprisonment. The Accused had decided to serve his sentence and did not apply for Bail Pending Appeal. The Accused completed serving his sentence and was released on 10 June 2019.

30     The factual matrix of this case demonstrated beyond a shadow of a doubt the need to protect the young from being exploited by the corrupt influence and behaviour of adult predators such as the Accused – over the Internet and in person. The Accused “spammed” or harassed the victim via Locanto until she agreed to meet him. Then, when there was no agreement during the meet-up on the consideration for sexual services to be provided by the victim, the Accused took advantage of her. The young victim found herself in the Accused’s car and being driven unexpectedly to the basement carpark. The Accused, who was well aware of the reluctance of the victim to engage in paid sex, nevertheless exploited her youthfulness and inexperience to safeguard herself. It is hardly surprising for the victim to be overtaken by the situation and being uncertain on how to react to the strong sexual advances of a 40-year-old man French-kissing her and digitally penetrating her while doing so.

## The Sentence

31     I had given the following Brief Remarks on Sentence in imposing an imprisonment term of 3 months:

> “I am grateful to the DPP and the DC for their assistance in this case. Having heard the submissions of the Prosecution and the Defence, I found that the custodial threshold for the sentence in this case has been crossed. It is clear that the dominant sentencing principle in this case is Deterrence.

> The High Court has touched upon the relevant sentencing factors and considerations for an offence under Section 376B(1) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224, Revised Edition 2008 (“PC”) in _Tan Chye Hin v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 3 SLR(R) 873</span>. Justice Lee Seiu Kin agreed in this case with Justice Choo Han Teck’s observation in _PP v Wang Minjiang_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 1 SLR(R) 867</span>, that “a fine alone should not be imposed for such offences, except in the most exceptional circumstances. A custodial sentence should be the norm to deter such behaviour and to reflect the seriousness of such offences.” As stated in the High Court cases, the dominant consideration in enacting s 376B was to protect the young and vulnerable from commercial exploitation.

> The maximum term of imprisonment for an offence under s376B(1) PC is 7 years. The maximum imprisonment term for a conviction of an attempt of this offence, read with s 511(2)(b) PC, would be half of that _i.e._ 3 years and 6 months. The Prosecution had asked for a sentence of at least 6 months’ imprisonment, based on a reduced calibration from the sentences of completed offences under s376B(1) PC. The DPP had submitted a table of sentencing precedents showing sentences of between 10 to 12 months of imprisonment for s376B(1) PC offences.

> In my view, the suggestion of an imprisonment of at least 6 months is too high in this case. I say this because using the sentences passed for cases where the sexual exploitation had occurred as starting or reference points would be inappropriate. The fact of actual exploitation is patently a significant sentencing factor. This is because the very reason for the law _i.e_. the protection of the young from being exploited has been compromised and the offender ought to be severely punished. The adverse physical and psychological effects of the sexual exploitation on the young victim are irreversible.

> In the present case before me, the Accused had been convicted of an Attempt, which means that in so far as the act of exploitation is concerned, it had not materialized. Therefore, the sentencing of the Offender in such a case cannot be on the same plane as that of one who had exploited the victim and carried out the sexual act.

> The DPP has pointed out in his sentencing submissions that the Accused eventually achieved what he had set out to do by engaging in a sexual act with the victim. If this fact is taken into account in the sentencing of the offender in this case, it would be tantamount to convicting him on a charge which he had not been convicted of. In fact, the Accused was originally charged with a completed offence under s376B(1) PC but that was amended by the Prosecution a few days before the beginning of the trial to an Attempted Offence as the sexual act engaged by the Accused and the girl was not carried out for consideration or money. It would be unfair to take the sex act into account in calibrating the sentence to be imposed for the conviction of an Attempted Offence.

> That said, the sentence to be passed on the Accused cannot be a slap on the wrist but has to be of sufficient punishment as to send out a deterrent message to discourage people from trying to gain the trust of immature girls for the purpose of commercial sex with them. Regardless of whether these girls had actively attracted the attention of the men, the law is there to prohibit without exceptions such attempts and propositions.

> All considered, a sentence of 3 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate in this case. In calibrating this sentence, I had taken into account, as rightly pointed out by the DPP, that the Accused was persistent in his conduct. The DPP is also right to point out that the Accused had claimed trial and should not be given a sentencing discount ordinarily given to offenders who plead guilty at the earliest opportunity. I had also taken into consideration that the Accused was a first offender for an offence of a sexual nature as he did not have any relevant antecedents. I also understand from the DPP that this is the first case of a person being prosecuted for an attempt to commit the offence under Section 376B(1) of the Penal Code.”
