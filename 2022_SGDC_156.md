### District Judge Luke Tan:

## Introduction

1       Irene Koh Limbert (“the accused”) was a Senior Property Executive of Newman & Goh Property Consultants Pte Ltd (“Newman & Goh”) from 6 August 2010 to 7 September 2012. Newman & Goh, in turn, was a management company which provided property and facilities management services to the Management Corporation Strata Titles (MCSTs) of various estates.

2       It was alleged that the accused had accepted a total sum of S$12,723 from one Ling Chun Teck Donald (“Ling”) over 11 occasions between March 2011 and November 2012, in connection with her employment at Newman & Goh. Ling ran the companies TAC Contracts Pte Ltd (“TAC”), Proseal Waterproofing Specialist and TAC Waterproofing Specialist (collectively “TAC and its related companies”), which provided waterproofing, general repairs and building maintenance services to the MCSTs that engaged Newman & Goh’s services.

3       The MCSTs mentioned in the charges, and the names of the relevant estates, are set out below

> (a)     Kew Gate (MCST No. 2246);

> (b)     Loyang Gardens (MCST No. 2086);

> (c)     Jade Mansion (MCST No. 0636);

> (d)     Treasure Place (MCST No. 3145);

> (e)     Peirce View (MCST No. 2085);

> (f)     Spring@Katong (MCST No. 3206):

> (g)     Jasmine Court (MCST No. 1102);

> (h)     Casa Jervois (MCST No. 1645);

> (i)     Lip Hing Industrial Building (MCST No. 1188); and

> (j)     Ching Shine Industrial Building (MCST No. 0725).

4       The Prosecution initially proceeded against the accused on 11 charges under section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241 (“PCA”). The contents of the charges were essentially the same, save for the amount of gratification involved, the dates of the alleged acceptance of the gratification, and the identity of the MCSTs that the accused was the agent for. As such, for easy reference, I have simply reproduced the text of the first charge, and also set out the differentiating details for the other charges in a table below.

5       The first charge (DAC-900246-2019 reads:

> You…are charged that you, on or about the 08th day of March 2011, being an agent, to wit, a Senior Property Executive in the employ of Newman & Goh Property Consultants Pte Ltd, did corruptly accept gratification of a sum of $500 from one Ling Chun Teck Donald, a Director of TAC Contracts Pte Ltd, as a reward for showing favour to TAC Contracts Pte Ltd in relation to your principal’s affairs, to wit, for advancing business interests of TAC Contracts Pte Ltd with Newman & Goh Property Consultants Pte Ltd, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

6       The essential differentiating details of the 11 charges, originally proceeded with, are set out in the table below.

7       Subsequently, the 11th charge was amended at the end of the Prosecution’s case to one under Section 5(a)(i) of the PCA. The amended 11th charge reads:

> You…are charged that you, on or about 27 November 2012, in Singapore, did corruptly receive gratification of S$607 in cash from one Ling Chun Teck Donald, a Director of TAC Contracts Pte Ltd, as a reward for advancing the business interests of TAC Contracts Pte Ltd and its related companies with Management Corporation Strata Title Nos. 2086, 1645 and 1102, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 5(a)(i) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

8       At the end of the trial, I convicted the accused of the following charges, some of which have been amended.

9       As for the other four charges, I was of the view that the Prosecution had failed to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt and I acquitted the accused of the charges.

10     For the seven charges that I convicted the accused of, I sentenced the accused as follows.

11     The Prosecution has since filed an appeal against the orders of acquittal in respect of DAC 900246/2019, DAC 900252/2019, DAC 900255/2019 and DAC 900256/2019, and my decision to amend three of the seven remaining charges (DAC 900247/2019, DAC900253/2019 and DAC 900254/2019). No appeal has been filed by the Defence.

12     For completeness, for the purposes of these Grounds of Decision, I set out below the reasons for my decisions on the amendment, conviction, acquittal, and/or sentence for the respective charges.

## Summary of Evidence

### Prosecution’s evidence in brief

13     I summarise the Prosecution’s charges below.

> (a)     For the 1st – 10th charges under s6(a) PCA: The allegation for each charge was essentially that the accused had corruptly accepted gratification as a reward for showing favour to TAC and its related companies in relation to the affairs of her respective principals, which were the MCSTs that had engaged TAC and its related companies for jobs at their respective estates, by advancing the business interests of TAC and its related companies with the respective MCSTs.

> (b)     For the 11th charge under s5(a)(i) PCA: The allegation was that the accused had corruptly received gratification as a reward for advancing the business interests of TAC and its related companies with the relevant MCSTs which had engaged TAC and its related companies for jobs at their respective estates.

14     The Prosecution called a total of five witnesses. They were as follows:

> (a)     Ling Chun Teck Donald (“Ling”) – He was the director of TAC Contracts Pte Ltd (“TAC”) and the boss of the other related companies concerned in these charges. Ling was the giver of sums of money to the accused. He was called to testify in court, and the statements recorded from him by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (“CPIB”), as well as the papers that were adduced when he pleaded guilty to corresponding charges of corruption, were admitted into evidence.

> (b)     SSI Yap Liying Michelle (“IO Michelle”) – She was the former investigation officer (IO) for this case, and has been with CPIB for 8 years. She was in charge of the investigations against both the accused and Ling, and recorded a statement from the accused (P27) as well as statements from Ling (P26-1 to P26-7).

> (c)     Cheng Wee Hong @ Dennis (“Dennis Cheng”) – He is the executive director of the property and facilities management department at Newman & Goh, and the accused’s superior.

> (d)     Low Poh Choo (“Linda”) - She is the senior office manager overseeing the accounts department at Newman & Goh.

> (e)     Alvin Tan Kuan Hwee (“Alvin”) - He is an officer with the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB). He assisted the former IO in serving the charges to the accused, and who recorded her cautioned statements after investigations had been completed. He is also the current IO.

15     In essence, the Prosecution’s case[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) was that from 2011 to 2012, TAC and its related companies were awarded contracts by the MCSTs of the estates under the accused’s charge. Ling, who was the boss of these companies, would give to the managing agents that he dealt with “referral fees”, or “tokens of appreciation”, or “commission” for the jobs awarded to his companies.

16     The main evidence led by the Prosecution to prove its case was: (1) Ling’s testimony, his record books and invoices, his statements, and his previous admissions in court when he was charged and convicted for his role in the corruption offences; and (2) evidence from the accused herself. Reference was also made to documents from Newman & Goh which related to the accused’s employment and deployment to the various estates, where she represented the MCSTs in dealing with contractors like Ling.

### Defence’s evidence in brief

17     The accused was the only witness for the Defence.

18     Her evidence was that at Newman & Goh, she was employed as a senior property executive managing multiple projects from the head office at Sin Ming, where she was sited, and she also visited the estates under her charge. For her job, the accused had to prepare documents, collect invoices or mails, issue and collect the maintenance fees, oversee the cleaners on the cleanliness of the estates, deal with maintenance and repair works for their common areas, address concerns from the subsidiary proprietors or the council members, and also handle legal cases or concerns with breaches of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act (“BMSMA”). She said that the MCSTs of the estates contracted with Newman & Goh and typically, the contract would include having Newman & Goh manage their accounts, advise them on the BMSMA, and manage the common property.

19     The accused said that for the routine work at the estates, the decision on renewal or replacement of the contractor would be made by the MCST. For remedial work to be done in respect of internal units, the managing agents would advise the subsidiary proprietor (SP) to get their own contractors, but the latter would also seek their advice, although any agreement reached would be between the SP and the contractor, and the SP would pay the contractor directly.

20     For works involving the common areas, the managing agents would get the contractor to quote for the rectification work, and the managing agents would source for a few quotes depending on the extent of the damage, and then tabulate all these quotations to submit to the MCST for review and approval. The MCST would then instruct the managing agent on whom to award the contract to according to its decision. The managing agent would then monitor the work done by the contractor, and if the work was in order, the managing agent would recommend to the MCST to make payment to the contractor. For works related to the urgent rectification of common property, for example, involving pipes bursting or leakage into the internal unit such as dripping into the living room, the procedure adopted differed from estate to estate.

21     The accused said that Newman & Goh maintained a list of different types of contractors, who would be the first responder if needed. She confirmed that Ling was on the list of contractors for Newman & Goh. Ling’s companies were Total Access Construction, TAC Private Limited and TAC waterproofing specialist, and they were involved in general works.

22     The accused said that in the course of her dealings with Ling, there was no agreement between her and Ling or his company for the payment of commission, and neither did Ling offer any commission to her for the award of contracts to him or his company. Further, the accused said that she did not ask or solicit for any commission from Ling or his companies for awarding jobs to him or his company.

23     The accused also said that after she resigned from Newman & Goh, she relocated to Macau in 2013. Up till that time, she did not receive any information that CPIB had started investigations into Ling and the people who had dealings with him. Only when she returned to Singapore for her grandmother’s wake on 25th March 2015, did a CPIB officer go to her mother’s house to serve her a notice to attend an interview. She subsequently met the investigation officer, IO Michelle, on 27th March 2015. In December 2018, she received an email about a change of investigation officer, as well as a request for her to report to CPIB on 4th January 2018. On this date, she was served with the charges, and she provided her cautioned statements to the CPIB (D2).

24     I will elaborate further on the accused’s evidence when discussing the elements of the various charges at a later stage.

## Submissions of Parties

### The main undisputed evidence and related issues

25     I set out below the main undisputed facts and related issues for this case:[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2)

> (a)     The accused did represent the various MCSTs stated in the charges at some point during her employment with Newman & Goh;

> (b)     Ling did give the accused white envelopes containing money, but it was disputed the number of times that this occurred.

> (c)     The monies in the white envelopes were tokens of appreciation. However, while the Prosecution took the view that the accused had recommended and referred the jobs to TAC and its related companies in connection with the monies, the accused says that she had invited TAC to quote for the jobs.

> (d)     The accused had accepted and received the monies in the white envelopes given to her, but the number of times that this occurred is disputed.

### Outline of Prosecution’s Submissions

26     The Prosecution submitted that the following evidence proved the accused’s guilt:

> (a)     The contemporaneous records of payments kept by Ling of payments that he had made to the managing agents including the accused. There records were admitted in evidence as P5A and P5B, and they largely evidenced the _actus reus_ of the offences.

> (b)     Ling’s statements given to the CPIB (P26-1 – P26-6), and the court records of Ling’s own plea of guilt (P1-P4), which corroborated and explained the payments of moneys set out in P5A and P5B. These, together with Ling’s statement P26-7, were evidence showing that Ling had incriminated both himself and the accused. Ling’s evidence was that it was his practice to give managing agents, “_referral fees_”, or “_tokens of appreciation_” or “_commission_” for the jobs awarded to his companies, and he kept detailed records of the cash that he had given to the accused (as well as to others). Ling gave a detailed account of these records to the CPIB in his statements recorded in 2014 and 2015, and these accounts incriminated the accused. The Prosecution argued that the incriminating account in these statements should be admitted and should substitute the inconsistent version that Ling gave in court.

> (c)     The accused’s statement P27 which was recorded on 27 March 2015, where the accused herself informed the recorder, IO Michelle at \[9\] of P27, that:

>> Although I am unable to recall how many times I had received this money from Donald Ling, I think I would have received a total sum that is should be less than $10,000. I am unable to be sure because he gave me the money in an ad-hoc manner. Each time the envelopes contained notes ranging from around $50 to $2000. I am unsure if there could have been around $3000 in the envelope but I do not think that I had received money consisting more than $5000 at one go...”

> (d)     The Prosecution stressed that the accused had incriminated herself in her statement P27, where she had admitted that she had received from Ling money, the total sum of which “_should be less than $10,000_”, and that she “_understood that the money was an appreciation for recommending and referring jobs to TAC_” (see \[9\] of statement P27).

> (e)     The Prosecution submitted that the accused’s account was largely congruent with Ling’s account in that the sum of $10,000 is close to the sum of $12,723, which was the total amount Ling said he gave to the accused, and the range of $50 to $2,000, also mentioned by the accused, was consistent with the amounts stated in nine out of the 11 charges against the accused

### Outline of Defence’s Submissions

27     The Defence tendered lengthy written submissions setting out its analysis of the law and evidence, and argued that the Prosecution had failed to establish its case. The Defence also submitted a reply in response to submissions from the Prosecution, and to questions posed by the court. I have set out the essence of their submissions, based on the concluding paragraphs of their written submissions. In brief, the Defence argued that the Prosecution has failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt each ingredient of the 11 charges, in respect of both the section 6(a) PCA and the Section 5(a)(i) PCA offences[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3).

> (a)     As regards the first element (_actus reus_) of the offences, there was clear evidence that Ling himself pocketed the monies set aside to be given to the managing agents for his own benefit instead. Further, the Defence argued that Ling had also given evidence that for the various charges, it would be impossible/improbable that he would have given the monies to the accused.

> (b)     As regards the second element of the offences, the accused was never informed by Ling that she was to be rewarded for the jobs that were granted to him. Further, the accused’s evidence was that after the first white envelope of cash was given to her by Ling, she had told him that it was not needed, and that when Ling gave her a second white envelope, she had told him not to give it to her because she was uncomfortable. While she had also received red packets and hampers from him, this was something that was practised industry wide. There was also no causal or consequential link between the gratification and the calling and granting of quotations.

> (c)     As regards the third element of the offence, the accused was not always in a position where she called for quotations. There were times that she was not managing the alleged estate, such as when she was on maternity leave. Further, she always followed the protocol on how to call for quotations. The gratification never acted on her mind because she was not aware of them, and she did not show any favour to Ling.

> (d)     As regards the fourth element of the offence, the gratification never acted on the accused’s mind, and hence she did not and could not have guilty knowledge about her actions when calling for quotations.

28     The Defence further argued that where the elements of the Section 6(a) PCA charge were not made out, the Prosecution could not rely on Section 9(1) PCA to save the charge, since section 9(1) PCA was only operative after the elements of the Section 6(a) PCA offence have been _prima facie_ satisfied.

29     Further, while the Prosecution was relying on the diary entries and the statements of Ling and the accused, and had taken the position that these documents were sufficient in proving the charges beyond a reasonable doubt, the Defence argued that it was unsafe to rely on these documents to convict the accused. Since it was the Prosecution’s burden to prove the charges against the accused, the Prosecution had to prove every relevant ingredient of the alleged offences beyond a reasonable doubt, and the Defence argued that Prosecution had failed to do so. Thus, the accused should be acquitted of all 11 charges.

## Amendment of charges to reflect alleged dates of acceptance/receipt

30     Before considering the main issue of whether the charges have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, I deal first with an ancillary issue that arose towards the end of the trial This related to the dates of alleged acceptance/receipt of each gratification. In this regard, at the end of the hearing, and following the filing of closing submissions and replies by parties, I had asked them to address me on the date of the alleged acceptance/receipt of each gratification.

31     In this respect, while it was clear that the Prosecution’s case was that Ling had given the sums of money to the accused as per his records set out in his notebook in P5A and P5B, and as he had explained in his statements P26-1 to P26-6, it was also clear that by Ling’s account, the gratifications were given to the managing agents after he himself had received payments (from the MCSTs) for the jobs that his companies had performed for them. Thus, since the records in P5A and P5B were of the dates that payments were received by his companies, it follows that the gratifications that he made to the managing agents, including to the accused, if at all, must have occurred after the dates stated in P5A and P5B.

32     This was an issue that I queried parties about. The Prosecution agreed with this analysis and invited the court to exercise its power under 128(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed (CPC) to amend the charges. This provision reads:

> 128**.**—(1) A court may alter a charge or frame a new charge, whether in substitution for or in addition to the existing charge, at any time before judgment is given.

\[emphasis added\]

33     In considering whether the court should exercise its discretion to amend the charge, I was guided by the High Court decision in _Goh Chin Soon v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 162</span> (“_Goh Chin Soon”_). There, the High Court had set out the following requirements that had to be met before a trial court could exercise its discretion to amend an existing charge on its own motion:[^4]

> (a)     The existing charge must be legally or evidentially deficient.

> (b)     The offence reflected in the intended amended charge must be readily apparent from the evidence already adduced before the trial court.

> (c)     The Prosecution must have discharged its evidential burden of proof on the intended amended charge given:

>> (i)       the state of the evidence before the trial court; and

>> (ii)       the stage of the trial.

> (d)     The amendment must not prejudice the accused person.

34     In the present case, in so far as the dates of the alleged offences were concerned, since it has always been Ling’s position in his statements P27-1 to P27-6, that he had given monies to the accused after the dates that he had recorded in P5A and P5B (i.e. when his own companies had been paid by the MCSTs) the dates of the supposed gratification on the charges should always be indicated as occurring “sometime after” the dates reflected in P5A and P5B. I was of the view that making a limited amendment in this manner for each charge would not prejudice the accused as her defence has always been that she did not receive any of the 11 sums of money alleged in the charges, and/or that she did not have the requisite _mens rea._ Thus, the accused was not exposed to the risk of meeting a radically different case against her due to such an amendment which consisted of adding the words “sometime after” to the date of each charge.

35     Accordingly, I made such an amendment by changing the dates of acceptance of the gratification for the 1st -10th charges, and the date of receipt of the gratification for the 11th charge, by replacing the words “on or about \[date\]” with the words “sometime after \[date\]”. I thereafter applied the procedural safeguards set out in section 129-131 of the CPC.

36     Both the Prosecution and Defence had no objections to the amendment made to each charge along the lines set out above.

## The law pertaining to the corruption offences

37     I next set out the relevant law pertaining to corruption offences, before determining whether the individual charges have been proven.

#### Section 6(a) of the PCA

38     Section 6(a) of PCA reads:

> If -(_a_) any agent corruptly accepts or obtains, or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain, from any person, for himself or for any other person, any gratification as an inducement or reward for doing or forbearing to do, or for having done or forborne to do, any act in relation to his principal's affairs or business, or for showing or forbearing to show favour or disfavour to any person in relation to his principal's affairs or business;

> ...

> he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.

39     The law on section 6(a) of the PCA was comprehensively reviewed by the Court of Appeal (CA) in _PP v Leng Kah Poh_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGCA 51</span> _(“Leng Kah Poh_”). In _Leng Kah Poh_, the CA explained at \[35\] that “(t)he broad scope of s 6(a) is meant to protect the fidelity of the agent/principal relationship which through the gift (or a promise of it) the third party intends to subvert...”.

40     As regards the specific elements of a section 6(a) PCA offence, the CA at \[20\] accepted the proposition in _Kwang Boon Keong Peter v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 2 SLR(R) 211</span> _(“Peter Kwang”)_ at \[32\], that the following elements need to be proven:

> (i)     Acceptance of gratification.

> (ii)     As an inducement or reward (for any act, favour or disfavour to any person in relation to the recipient's principal's affairs or business)

> (iii)     There was an objectively corrupt element in the transaction.

> (iv)     The recipient accepted the gratification with guilty knowledge.

41     The CA in _Leng Kah Poh_ further emphasised at \[20\] that the first element is the _actus reus_ of the offence. The other three elements pertain to the _mens rea_ of the recipient.

42     As regards the second element of corruption under s 6(_a_) PCA, in the context of the present charges, this concerns “_the causal, or consequential, link_” between the gratifications and the acts the gratifications were intended to reward: _Leng Kah Poh_ \[at \[22\]; _Tjong Mark Edward v PP and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 375</span> (“_Mark Tjong_”) at \[16\] citing _Tey Tsun Hang v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 1189</span> (“_Tey Tsun Hang_”) at \[17\]. In the latter case, Woo J had stated:

> 17 Although the second and third elements are conceptually different, they are part of the same factual enquiry. The question is whether the recipient received the gratification believing that it was given to him as a quid pro quo for conferring a dishonest gain or advantage on the giver in relation to his principal's affairs. The court has treated these two elements together in its assessment of whether an offence is made out. Thus, the causal, or consequential, link between the gratification and the act of favour alleged to be procured was examined … under the rubric of an objective corrupt element.

#### Section 5(a)(i) of the PCA

43     As for the amended 11th charge, which was for an offence under section 5(a)(i) of the PCA, this provision reads:

> Any person who shall by himself or by or in conjunction with any other person…corruptly solicit or receive, or agree to receive for himself, or for any other person…any gratification as an inducement to or reward for, or otherwise on account of (i) any person doing or forbearing to do anything in respect of any matter or transaction whatsoever, actual or proposed… shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.

44     In the recent case of _Abdul Aziz bin Mohamed Hanib v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGHC 101</span>, Vincent Hoong J confirmed at \[107\] the four legal elements of an offence under s 5 of the PCA to be as follows:

> (a)     Element 1: The giving or receipt of gratification.

> (b)     Element 2: As an inducement (or reward) for any person doing (or forbearing to do) anything in respect of any matter.

> (c)     Element 3: There was an objective corrupt element in the transaction.

> (d)     Element 4: The gratification was given or received with guilty knowledge.

45     Thus, the elements that need to be proven for the 11th charge under s 5(a)(i) of the PCA ,are largely similar to the elements that have to be proven for the 1st to 10th charges under s 6(a), with the first element of both sets of charges constituting the _actus reus_, and the second to fourth elements constituting the _mens rea_. The essential difference between the sets of charges is that for the first set of ten charges, it must be shown that the accused was the agent for the principal (i.e. the respective MCSTs named in the charges) at the relevant time, while for the 11th charge, there is no reference to any agent/principal at all.

46     The difference between the offences under s 5 and s 6 of the PCA was explained by the learned Sundaresh Menon CJ in _PP v Wong Chee Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 5 SLR 807</span> (“_Wong Chee Meng_”) at \[59\]. His Honour stated:

> First, **_s 5 of the PCA is of a much wider remit than s 6_**. This court in _Song Meng Choon Andrew v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1090</span> at \[31\] observed that there was a degree of overlap between the two provisions, with **_s 5 likely being broad enough to encompass most if not all cases under s 6. But the converse is not necessarily true_**_._ **_The gravamen of the offence under s 6 of the PCA is rooted in the notion of agents who have allowed their loyalty to their principal to become suborned through the corrupt receipt of gratification_**. This stands slightly apart from **_s 5 of the PCA, which targets corrupt transactions more generally_**. Given this, there is the distinct possibility of different sentencing considerations being relevant for offences under s 5 of the PCA.

\[emphasis added\]

47     It is relevant to note that s 9(1) PCA does not make reference to, nor directly apply to an offence under s 5(a)(i) PCA. S 9(1) PCA will be discussed more fully at a later part of these Grounds of Decision.

## Assessing the _actus reus_ and _mens rea_ requirements and related issues

48     To establish its case, the Prosecution has to prove the elements of each of the 11 charges framed under section 6(a) or 5(a)(i) of the PCA respectively. These are essentially the respective _mens rea_ and _actus reus_ of the offences.

49     I will first examine these requirements for the various offences, and consider how they apply in general for the 11 charges. I will then consider whether each of the 11 charges have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

### Actus Reus - acceptance/receipt of gratification

50     As stated above, the main evidence pertaining to the _actus reus_ requirement emanated from Ling and the accused.

#### Incriminating evidence from Ling

51     Ling admitted in court to having given money to the accused, and explained that this was “market practice” or “culture practice” for businessman like himself to do so as a token of appreciation. More substantive evidence that money was given to the accused, and that such gratification was accepted/received by her, emerged from other documentary evidence that was adduced in the course of the trial.

##### (1)   Records of Payments made by Ling – P5A and P5B

52     First, the payments made by Ling to the various managing agents, including to the accused, were documented by him in two record books P5A and P5B. To illustrate, in respect of his giving of the gratification as reflected in the accused’s 1st charge, Ling had personally made hand-written records, _inter alia_, of the date that he received payment for the job that he performed at the estate (8/3/2011), the recipient of the corrupt monies (“Irene” i.e. the accused), the estate involved (Spring@Katong), the value of the contract ($5,000) and the amount of gratification given to her ($500 i.e. 10% of the contract sum.

53     A perusal of P5A and P5B showed that Ling had dutifully made explicit records of the gratification that he had given to the managing agents, including the payments made to the accused that were the subject matter of the charges against her. Ling had explained that “…the referral fees **_are given_** to those managing agents after the date in which payment was received”. (P26-1 at \[51\]).

54     Similar to the record for the 1st charge set out above, the other entries made by Ling in P5A and P5B showed the amounts of gratification, the contract amount sum involved, the recipient of the gratification, the dates that Ling received payment for the job (following which gratifications were made to the accused), and the estate involved to the accused, and to other managing agents. I agreed with the Prosecution that the evidence showed that even though Ling did, on occasion, consolidate several amounts of referral fees before giving them to managing agents, Ling was quite clear in his statements that he had always ultimately give the referral fees (as recorded in P5A and P5B) to the agents.[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5)

##### (2)   Impeachment under the Evidence Act

55     In the course of the detailed statements (P26-1-P26-7) that were recorded from Ling on seven occasions between 13th March 2014 to 9 July 2015, Ling had consistently maintained that he made payments to the managing agents, including to the accused. The confirmation that he made in his statements were based on the earlier (contemporaneous) entries that he had recorded in P5A and P5B.

56     The contents of Ling’s statements, including the admissions that he made about the of gratifications to the accused, were subsequently reflected in the proceeded and TIC charges tendered against Ling. These were also the charges which Ling had admitted and accepted in court, before he was himself was sentenced on 22 December 2016. Ling’s sentences for his corruption offences, were subsequently affirmed in the High Court on 30 June 2017.

57     However, while testifying as a witness in the trial of the accused before me, a trial which took place from 2020, Ling surprisingly resiled from the position he had previously taken when giving evidence to the CPIB in 2014 and 2015, which was also the same position he took before both the trial court (in 2016) and the appellate court (in 2017), that he had indeed given the money to the accused on these occasions. Instead, at the accused’s trial, Ling took a different position - that the entries that he had earlier made in P5A and P5B were only of monies that _he had set aside but not necessarily given_ to the various managing agents, including the accused.

58     Ling even claimed in the accused’s trial that he could not remember how many times he had actually handed out white envelopes with money to the accused, but that it was at least once or twice. He also claimed that he did not remember how much was in the envelopes.[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) Specifically, of the $12,273 that he had earlier admitted to being for the accused (as reflected in his record books P5A and P5B), Ling now said that he could not remember how much of this actually was given to the accused. Further, Ling now even claimed that while he only gave the accused white envelopes once or twice, he could not remember if she had returned any of the white envelopes to him.[^7]In addition, Ling alleged that he had given red packets to the accused for Chinese New Year and during her child’s birthday or baby shower, all of which do not appear to be what he had informed the CPIB in his statements in 2014 and 2015.

59     As his testimony before me was materially different from the accounts that he had made in his CPIB statements, specifically on whether he had in fact given the gratification to the accused on the 11 occasions set out in the charges, the Prosecution applied to impeach his credit.

60     In the course of the impeachment proceedings, it became obvious that in contrast to the distinct, explicit and unmistakable accounts that he had previous given in his various CPIB statements – specifically that the records that he made in P5A and P5B documented the times and sums of money that he had given to the various managing agents (including to the accused) - Ling’s rather belated claim that the records merely showed that he had set aside but not always given the money, were feeble, inexplicable and unsupported.

61     When called upon to explain the inconsistencies between his testimony in Court and in his statements given to the CPIB, Ling was not able to do so, largely claiming, rather unconvincingly, that he did not know what he was thinking when he gave the statements to the CPIB, and that he was also in deep depression and only wanted to give his statements and to go home. Yet at the same time, Ling admitted that he had “no arguments” with his statements.[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8)

62     In short, Ling could not explain away the material inconsistencies, or account for why they arose only so much later, in particular, so many years after the event, and so many years after he himself had confessed in his various statements recorded in 2014 and 2015 to having performed the corrupt acts. In fact, in my view, that Ling had subsequently repeated and admitted to the same corrupt acts (stated in his CPIB statements) in court during his own plea of guilty in 2016, clearly showed those admissions (to having given money to the managing agents) to be what he himself accepted as having actually taken place.

63     Further, while Ling now also claimed that he only gave the accused money in envelopes on no more than two occasions, he was unable to remember the dates and details of these two occasions, as opposed to the numerous occasions of gifting that he had faithfully recorded in P5A and P5B (which were the subject matter of the charges). Yet in line with what I had earlier observed, Ling essentially agreed to the account in \[18\] of his Statement of Facts (P4) that he had previously admitted to in court during his own plead guilty mention, and confirmed the contents to be accurate.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9)

64     When confronted with the differences in account, Ling was not able to explain why his version in court for the accused’s trial, differed in such material ways from the otherwise consistent account he had given earlier to the CPIB, where he had quite consistently maintained that he had given the money to the accused (and the other managing agents) as he himself had recorded in P5A and P5B.

65     It appeared that Ling’s motivation for changing his evidence in court in 2020, from one that was damaging to the accused, to one that essentially absolved her of the charges that she was currently facing, was not because Ling had suddenly and belatedly realised that he had given the inaccurate accounts in his statements in 2014 and 2015, and had also repeated the same inaccurate version when he pleaded guilty and was sentenced in 2016 (as affirmed on appeal in 2017). Instead, it appeared that Ling’s change of mind, and his switch in stance at the accused’s trial, may have been connected with the fact that he “_felt very bad and sympathetic to all \[his\] recipients_” (such as the accused).

66     All in all, arising from the impeachment exercise when Ling had been given a chance, and had failed to explain the material discrepancies, I was of the view that Ling’s credit had indeed been impeached and I found him not to be a witness of credit.

##### (3)   Ling’s statements – substitution and weight of evidence

67     This was, however, not the end of the matter. The Prosecution also applied to admit the parts of Ling’s statements, that were inconsistent and used to impeach him, as substantive evidence of the facts stated therein to substitute Ling’s testimony in court. In this regard, section 147(3) and section 147(6) of the Evidence Act, Cap 97 (EA) provides as follows:

> (3)    Where in any proceedings a previous inconsistent or contradictory statement made by a person called as a witness in those proceedings is proved by virtue of this section, that statement shall by virtue of this subsection be admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein of which direct oral evidence by him would be admissible.

> ….

> (6)    In estimating the weight, if any, to be attached to a statement admissible in evidence by virtue of this section regard shall be had to all the circumstances from which any inference can reasonably be drawn as to the accuracy or otherwise of the statement and, in particular, to the question whether or not the statement was made contemporaneously with the occurrence or existence of the facts stated, and to the question whether or not the maker of the statement had any incentive to conceal or misrepresent the facts.

68     In the present case, I agreed with the Prosecution[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10) that generally, and subject to my comments below for the 11th charge, reliance should be placed on the account given by Ling in his six statements P26-1 to P26-6 that were recorded from him by the CPIB. My reasons for coming to this assessment are set out below.

69     First, considering the factors that may affect accuracy and Ling’s recollection of events:

> (a)     Ling’s statements that he gave to the CPIB were made in 2014 and 2015, which was within 2 or 3 years of his giving the sums of monies gratification to the accused in 2011 and 2012. It would thus be expected that the events surrounding his giving of the monies to the accused would be relatively fresh in his mind at the time the CPIB recorded the statements from him. This was contrasted to the contrary testimony that Ling gave in court for the accused’s trial in 2020, which was a different version thus appeared only about 8 to 9 years after the offences were committed. Even though Ling had apparently given another statement to the CPIB closer to trial that was more aligned with his evidence in court in 2020 (this statement was not admitted into evidence), the fact remains that the later statement was also given much later than P26-1 to P26-6, when Ling’s recollection of the facts would likely have been more precise and accurate. In short, Ling’s accounts in P26-1 to P26-6, were more reliable in that being made “contemporaneously with the occurrence or existence of the facts stated” (as per s 147(6) EA).

> (b)     In addition, there was essentially no dispute that the payments in P5A and P5B were recorded by Ling even closer to the purported dates that payments were said by him (in P26-1 to P26-6) to have been made to the accused. These records in P5A and P5B set out many details of the payments to the accused, including the details of the jobs, the date that he was paid for those jobs, as well as the gratification he would have made to the accused thereafter. Thus, the reliance that Ling made to these contemporaneous records in P5A and P5B, when giving his accounts in P26-1 to P26-6, fortified the truth and accuracy of the accounts given by Ling in his statements P26-1 to P26-6.

> (c)     In contrast, Ling’s account in court, that he merely set aside the money and that he had made no more than two payments, which were NOT the payments recorded in P5A and P5B, were in contrast, NOT supported by any documents. As highlighted by the Prosecution, despite claiming that his account in court (rather than his account in his statements) was the truth, Ling admitted that he did not keep any other separate record of moneys he claimed to have actually _given_ to the managing agents. Thus, there were no documents to contradict the payment records in P5A and P5B.

70     As for the factor set out in 147(6) EA concerning whether Ling had any motive to lie when he was giving the version set out in his statements P26-1 to P26-6, I note that:

> (a)     The accounts that Ling gave in his statements about giving monies to the accused, were self-incriminating accounts where Ling also implicated himself. In this regard, as noted by See Kee Oon J in _Pigg, Derek Gordon at \[78\], “…_as a matter of logic, a statement that is made against the interests of its maker is inherently more reliable” (citing _Lee Chez Kee v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 3 SLR(R) 447</span> at \[102\]). Thus, arising from his account in P26-1 to P26-6, Ling had faced corresponding charges for giving the 11 sums of cash to the accused.

> (b)     Indeed, I also note that when Ling was in court in 2016 and 2017 to deal with his own case, rather than disavow or recant the accounts in P26-1 to P26-6 which were clearly against his own interest (as much as they implicated the accused), Ling had instead admitted to those charges and agreed to those facts in court, for which he was ultimately punished and had to undergo incarceration.

> (c)     This fact of acting against his own self-interest by admitting to both the CPIB and to the court (in his own criminal case) that he had bribed the accused on the occasions set out in the charges, provide a strong basis for accepting that Ling’s self-incriminating accounts in P26-1 to P26-6 should be believed.

> (d)     Further, as correctly pointed out by the Prosecution, in court, Ling had admitted that he had no reason to admit to more money being given to the accused than what he in fact given to her.

71     In addition, again on the weight to be ascribed to the inconsistent portions of Ling’s statements, I took into account the guidance set out in _Tan Kim Seng Construction_ that the whole of the statement(s) should be examined, and also considered Ling’s statements in this manner. In this regard, I note that:

> (a)     Ling had signed on each and every one of his statements. In court, he admitted that he was given the opportunity to read and amend his statements before he signed them. Yet, he did not make any amendment to the portions of his statements that were inculpatory, and which also implicated the accused.

> (b)     Ling admitted that he had clarified with the CPIB at \[353\] of P26-4 and \[697\] of P26-6 that he had not given an amount of $21,250 to the accused despite his record on page 3 at S/N 69 of P5B that indicated otherwise. Yet he had made no such clarification for the payments to the accused that are the subject matter of the charges, including the sum of $3,000 for Kansai Paint (P7). I agreed with the Prosecution that this episode, subject to evidence proving otherwise, supported the inference that payments to the accused as reflected in P5A and P5B had likely been made, subject to evidence that contradicted these records.

> (c)     Ling had also specifically indicated that certain managing agents, such as Edmund, Desmond, Simon, Feroz, and Earl, had rejected monies that he had offered to them. Indeed, Ling admitted that he had informed the CPIB at \[182\] of P26-3, and at \[295\], \[300\], \[303\]-\[309\], \[139\]-\[140\] and \[354\] of P26-4, when the managing agents had rejected his payment despite his records in P5A and P5B. In contrast, Ling made no such clarification for the accused’s case, in that Ling had never said that the accused had rejected the money offered by Ling to her.

> (d)     Thus, the distinction he made between the monies that were not accepted/received when offered to some agents, as compared to the monies that were paid to, and accepted/received by the accused, clearly indicated that Ling was very precise and careful when he discussed the contents of P5A and P5B when he gave his statements to CPIB. Specifically, Ling had intentionally highlighted the differences between those who accepted the money that he offered, and those who did not. The accused was one of those who accepted what he offered to her. In short, Ling’s evidence was that the accused had accepted the monies that he had offered to her.

> (e)     Next, moving on to Ling’s claim in court that at the time of statement giving, he did not know what he was thinking, that he was in depression, and that he just wanted to finish giving his statements and to go home, I rejected these allegations.

>> (i)       First, it was clear that Ling’s statements were not given in single setting, or even over a short period. Instead, his numerous statements over given over the course of 2014 and 2015, and he was given ample opportunities, each time he was asked to give a fresh statement, to recant or amend the account that he had given in his earlier one. This he never once did, in the course of recording no less than 7 statements in all.

>> (ii)       Instead, Ling continued to give detailed accounts each time he was questioned, and essentially reaffirmed that he was the giver of the monies to the various managing agents, including the accused, who accepted the monies. Ling also gave a clear reason that each sum of money was given as a token of appreciation to the managing agents for what they did for his companies. In addition, as correctly highlighted by the Prosecution, Ling also conceded when giving evidence in the accused’s trial, that he had no argument with his previous statements.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11) Moreover, for the estates managed by the accused of the MCSTs identified in the charges, Ling did indeed provide services to them, and continued to do so during the material period. All these objective facts put paid to Ling’s bare and unsubstantiated claims that his statements were inaccurate due to his state of depression when giving his statements, or he was in a hurry to finish doing so. Indeed, quite aside from the fact that I found unbelievable Ling’s claim that the earlier account he gave in his statements to be false, his alleged reasons for doing so also did not pass muster.

>> (iii)       Instead, I would add that the objective facts, including the comprehensive entries in P5A and P5B which set out details of the sums of money that Ling gave to the accused, and the evidence of the continuing engagement of Ling’s company to carry out works for those estates manged by the accused on behalf of the relevant MCSTs,, added further weight to the truth of the contents of P26-1 to P26-6. In essence, they substantiated the Prosecution’s argument that money was indeed given by Ling to the accused, in connection with the accused’s influence in referring jobs to TAC and its related companies for these estates.

>> (iv)       All in all, the evidence showed that contrary to Ling’s claim that he was not thinking, or that he was depressed and overwhelmed (and hence less circumspect and careful) when he made his confessions in P26-1 to P26-6, which accounts also implicated the accused, Ling had exercised care and deliberation when he gave his accounts to the CPIB, and these accounts were clearly reliable. In this regard, I generally agreed with the Prosecution that Ling’s account in P26-1 to P26-7 to the CPIB of the gratification he made to the accused “… was _not_ a mindless exercise of him simply regurgitating to the CPIB what was he had recorded in P5A and P5B”. [\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12)

72     For completeness, I would deal with the claim made by the Defence that Ling had given red packets/hampers to the accused, rather than the 11 sums of money in the white envelopes mentioned in the 11 charges. Amongst other things, the Defence had claimed that Ling had mentioned about “_alternative forms of gifting_”. However, I agreed with the Prosecution that this issue was a bit of a red herring, as they did not detract from evidence that he did, in fact, give the gratifications set out in the 11 charges. I elaborate below.

> (a)     First, I agreed with the Prosecution’s argument set out at \[10\] of its reply that while Ling had mentioned about the “_alternative forms of gifting_” this was in respect of gifting to _other clients._ The undisputed fact was that Ling had never indicated, in his many statements to the CPIB, that he made any other form of gifting to the accused, other than giving her money in white envelopes, which was the subject matter of the charges against her. Specifically, there is _no_ evidence in Ling’s statements that Ling did give hampers etc to the accused.

> (b)     Further, the accused herself did not mention, in her detailed statement P27, about any red packets or hampers having been given to her by Ling, in connection with her interactions with TAC. This despite the fact that P27 was recorded much closer to the date of the offences i.e. on 27 March 2015. Instead, I note that the sums of gratification given to the accused by Ling, which were the subject matter of the current charges, and which are explicitly highlighted by the accused as having been given to her in white envelopes (see \[9\] of P27), were instead specifically stated by her to have been for her recommending and referring jobs to TAC, and not due to any festive season. Indeed, the accused had stated at \[9\] of P27 that the money in the envelopes were:

>> “…an appreciation for recommending and referring jobs to TAC. **_There was no other reason why he would pass me money because it was not a festive seaso_**n and I did not borrow any money from him. He also did not borrow any money from me.”

\[emphasis added\]

> (c)     While the Defence argued that it would not be reasonable to expect the accused to be so thorough when giving information during the interview[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13), I beg to differ. Indeed, when one considered that the focus of P27 was clearly about sums of money given to her by Ling, the failure by the accused to make any kind of mention of the red packets allegedly given to her by Ling on more than one occasion, spoke volumes by its absence.

> (d)     While the accused did ultimately make the claim that she had been given red packets by Ling during festive season or her children’s birthdates (although there was still no mention of hampers being given to her), these reference was only done very belatedly many years later when her cautioned statement (D2) was recorded on 4 January 2019. This was also well after Ling had himself been dealt with in open court, when the accused could have known that Ling had _inter alia_, admitted to giving the corrupt monies to managing agents. Hitherto, and as correctly pointed out by the Prosecution,[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14) despite having given 7 statements to the CPIB over the course of 2 years, Ling had never said that he had given red packets to the accused despite being repeatedly and specifically questioned about his acts of corruption involving managing agents such as the accused.

> (e)     However, even if red packets, hampers or other gifts (aside from the money in white envelopes) had been made by Ling to the accused, and whether the accused may or may not also have accepted them, the fact remains that none of these items were not the subject matter of any of the charges against the accused. Thus, they do not detract from the gratification – given in cash in white envelopes – that were the focus of the trial. In short, quite aside from the fact that these belated claims were highly doubtful, they were also not of significance in proving (or disproving) the specific charges relating to the 11 sums corruptly given to the accused in cash.

73     All in all, for the reasons set out above, I was generally satisfied that weight should be placed on P5A and P5B, and on P26-1 to P26-6, in proving the actus reus of the offences. That said, I did, however, have particular concern over the gratification allegedly received by the accused sometime after 27 November 2012, as reflected in the 11th charge, since there was no dispute that the accused had left the employ of Newman & Goh by then, and she would clearly not be dealing with Ling for any of the estates. I will consider this issue further, at a later part of my judgment (see\[273\] to \[278\] below).

74     However, while my concern was over the sums that were the subject matter of the 11th charge, the parts of his statements P26-1 to P26-6 that have been shown to be dependable and accurate, particularly with respect to his accounts concerning the giving of the gratification for the 1st to 10th charges when the accused was clearly still employed by Newman & Goh, should be relied on, especially in light of the reasons set out above. As noted in _Tang Keng Boon v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 1 SLR(R) 104</span>; <span class="citation">\[2000\] SGHC 9</span>, even where a witness is impeached, and parts of his previous inconsistent statements are used to substitute his evidence, the court will still have to assess the individual inconsistent statement(s) to determine if they support the different charges.

75     At this stage, for ease of reference, I reproduce the material parts of Ling’s statements, where he discussed the gratification given to the accused that related to each of the charges.[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15)

76     As stated earlier, in general, the incriminating contents of Ling’s statements, where he had admitted to making these payments to the accused, were subsequently also reflected in the proceeded and TIC charges against Ling, that he had admitted in court for the corresponding corruption charges that were proceeded with against him. Ling’s sentences for his corruption offences, were subsequently affirmed in the High Court on 30 June 2017.

77     In addition, much of what was contained in Ling’s statements, where he had admitted giving the monies to the accused, was also corroborated by the accused’s own statement. It is to this crucial piece of evidence that I turn to next.

#### Admissions by the accused contained in P27

78     The Prosecution’s case is that in the accused’s own statement P27, she had made admissions that supported the Prosecution’s case.

##### (1)   The major incriminating parts of the accused’s statement P27

79     I set out the relevant parts of \[9\] below, with some parts highlighted in bold italics for emphasis.

> \[9\]    I am now asked by the recording officer if I had ever received money from anyone from TAC. **_I wish to say that I had received money in the form of cash in a white envelope from Donald Ling_**. I did not receive money from any other staff of TAC other than Donald Ling. Donald Ling would usually pass me the money at the carpark near my house in Serangoon. **_I remember that the first time Donald Ling passed me an envelope with money, he told me that the envelope was for me and he went off_**. **_When I opened it, I realized it was money._** I felt awkward because I did not know what to do with the money which he suddenly gave me money and he had just gone off like that. Prior to him passing the money to me we were chatting about work and family. He told me he had to go off and just passed me the envelope. There was no explicit conversation on what the money was for. However, **_I understood that the money was an appreciation for recommending and referring jobs to TAC._** There was no other reason why he would pass me money because it was not a festive season and I did not borrow any money from him. He also did not borrow any money from me…**_Although I am unable to recall how many times I had received this money from Donald Ling, I think I would have received a total sum that is should be less than $10,000. I am unable to be sure because he gave me the money in an ad-hoc manner. Each time the envelopes contained notes ranging from around $50 to $2000_**. I **_am unsure if there could have been around $3000 in the envelope_** but **_I do not think that I had received money consisting more than $5000 at one go_**… **_I just kept the money and spent it_** on the site staff and on my family expenses, since I would put the money into my wallet and mix it with my own money.

80     In essence, based on the highlighted parts of P27:

> (a)     The accused admitted that Ling had passed her cash in white envelopes on numerous occasions;

> (b)     She understood that the sums of money were given to her by Ling in “…appreciation for recommending and referring jobs to TAC”;

> (c)     While she was not sure of the number of times she received the money from Ling, she believes that the total sum she received was less than $10,000;

> (d)     Further, while the accused claimed that the sums she received each time consisted of notes “ranging from around $50 to $2000”, she apparently alluded to the possibility that the sums received each time could be more than $2,000 (but less than $5,000) when she also said that “I **am unsure** if there could have been around $3000 in the envelope but I do not think that I had received money consisting more than $5000 at one go”.

> (e)     Finally, the accused admitted that she “kept the money and spent it”. In other words, the accused accepted/received, retained and made use of the sums given to her as gratification by Ling.

81     It was thus clear that the admissions of the accused, corroborated Ling’s accounts in his statements to the CPIB that:

> (a)     He had given her sums of money on various occasions. In his statements, he had stated that a total of 11 sums of money, as recorded in P5A and P5B, and in his statements P26-1 to P26-6, were given to the accused. In P27, the accused admitted that she received the money from him although she could not remember exactly how many occasions she had received money from him.

> (b)     The money was given to her in cash in white envelopes.

> (c)     The sums of money that Ling gave to the accused on each occasion were (mainly) below $5,000 in that they ranged from $60 (5th charge) to $2,981 (2nd charge) \[with only one occasion where the sum of money given was more than $5,000 i.e. $5,305 for the 3rd charge\].

> (d)     The accused accepted/received and kept the monies offered to her by Ling. The accused, in her statement, P27 even admitted to having spent the money given to her by Ling.

> (e)     The money was given by Ling to managing agents, including the accused, as “referral fees” for jobs given to him, and he would only give them the money after he himself was paid for those jobs. In P27 at \[9\] (and \[32\]), the accused admitted that she “understood that the money was an appreciation for recommending and referring jobs to TAC.”

##### (2)   Why I accepted the admissions made by accused in P27

82     When it came to the accused’s turn to testify, while not denying that she was the maker of P27, and that P27 was a voluntary statement, the accused attempted to dispute the accuracy of the contents of P27. Essentially, while claiming that _everything_ contained in P27 was information given by her to the recorder, IO Michelle, the accused insisted that the parts of P27 w_hich were not in her favour_, namely the ranges of money which she received from Ling as recorded at \[9\] of P27, were not information provided by her, but emanated from the recorder, IO Michelle, instead. In line with such a claim, the accused added that she had told IO Michelle that:

> (a)     She was unsure of the amount given to her, although it was probably in the hundreds, something that she claimed that she repeatedly told IO Michelle;

> (b)     That it was IO Michelle who asked her whether they should put the range as $50 to $2,000, and she (the accused) just agreed;

> (c)     It was also IO Michelle who had asked her if the amount that the accused had taken from Ling could be around $3,000, and the accused said that she had informed IO Michelle that she could not remember any of the amounts given to her;

> (d)     The $10,000 that was mentioned at \[9\] of P27 was a claim that emanated from IO Michelle and not from the accused, and that the latter had simply accepted the inclusion of the words “_less than $10,000_” in her statement P27, because it was a range and a “few-hundreds” fell within this range. In this regard, the accused further claimed that she did not think that by saying “_less than $10,000_” meant that the total amount she received was near to $10,000.

83     Notwithstanding the accused’s attempt to distant herself from the admissions she had made in P27, I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused’s claims – that the inculpatory portions of P27 were inaccurate and unreliable - could not be believed. I explain below.

84     First, I note that when IO Michelle the recorder of the accused’s statement P27 was on the stand, there was no allegation made by the Defence to IO Michelle that the accused’s statement P27 was inaccurate, let alone that the various incriminating claims contained within the accused’s statement had actually been initiated, unilaterally included, or even suggested by IO Michelle.

> (a)     In my view, a failure to do so had a serious adverse effect on the later claims made by the accused in light of the rule in _Browne v Dunn_. As explained by Chan Seng Onn J (as he then was) in _Parti Liyani v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 187</span>:

>> The rule operates on the proposition that an individual should be confronted with any contradictory evidence that is being relied upon (and intended to be adduced) by the cross-examiner” (at \[41\])….

>> The rationale underpinning the _Browne v Dunn_ rule is so that a witness is granted the opportunity to explain and clarify his or her position or version of facts before any contradictory version is put forth to the court as one of fact.

> (b)     Further, in _Ong Pang Siew v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 1 SLR 606</span>, the Court of Appeal, in making clear the ambit and the effect of a failure to comply with the rule in _Browne v Dunn_, stated at \[81\]:

>> There is an established rule of evidence that if what a witness says is not challenged, the evidence is deemed to have been admitted: the rule in _Browne v Dunn_ (1893) 6 R 67. The purpose of the rule is to secure procedural fairness in litigation (see _Yeo Kwan Wee Kenneth v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 2 SLR(R) 45</span> (at \[3\])). The rule requires that matters that are challenged be put to the witness during cross-examination to give the witness an opportunity to respond. **_Unchallenged testimony may be considered by the court to be undisputed by the opposing party and therefore accepted_**.

\[emphasis added\]

> (c)     The failure by the Defence to challenge IO Michelle, who had made clear that the contents of P27 were provided by the accused, was highly damning. Indeed, the accused’s claim that the incriminating contents in her statement P27 were all suggested by IO Michelle (the recorder) rather than the words of the accused herself, was something that was not obvious on the evidence, nor suggested to IO Michelle beforehand. Thus, its belated and dubious nature, and the fact that it was also unsubstantiated, made it incredible and completely unbelievable.

85     Second, when the accused was confronted with her failure to put forward her inconsistent version to IO Michelle, and in general for giving different accounts in court from what she had earlier stated in P27, the accused vacillated, and gave incoherent and again unbelievable responses. I set out below some areas pointed out by the Prosecution,[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16) where the accused clearly was unable to account for the inconsistencies, and gave incredible answers instead.

> (a)     For one, on why she did not put forward and challenge IO Michelle’s account that P27 had been accurately recorded from the accused, the latter claimed that she “_I don’t know I can challenge ..._ **_or probably_** _can’t remember that until ... my lawyer asked me the question on this part, then I realised and I explained to him..._”

> (b)     Her answer was clearly contrived and unconvincing. In this regard, I note that the accused had sat in court throughout the evidence given by IO Michelle, and had in fact been given a copy of her own statement P27 beforehand. If that statement had really been inaccurately recorded, and such inaccuracy was the result of IO Michelle’s actions, it was inconceivable that the accused would not have known this before the trial and had not informed her counsel of this. Further, even if she had somehow not have been aware before the trial commenced, it was incredible that she would still be as ignorant and had not informed her counsel to challenge IO Michelle when the latter was on the stand. I thus disbelieved her feeble attempt at explaining her inaction in challenging IO Michelle’s evidence on such a material matter.

> (c)     Next, in respect of the accused’s account of how the phrase “_less than $10,000_” came to be recorded at \[9\] of P27, which the accused claimed was a figure that originated from IO Michelle, the accused was asked why she had not amended the words “less than $10,000” to read as “less than $2,000” at the time of statement recording, if this was really what she meant. To this, she said: “... it didn’t struck me at that moment in time to challenge ... my statement content. I thought only when I will be queried and explained while I’m on the stand”.

> (d)     However, I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused’s attempted explanation was illogical, as there could not have been any contemplation that she would be “on the stand” **_at that very early stage_** in when P27 was being recorded from her. Further, as pointed out by the Prosecution, the accused’s claim - that it had not struck her at the time of statement recording to challenge (change) that part of her statement - was obviously untrue, since she did make substantial amendments at other parts of P27. In addition, in her _Case for the Defence_, a document filed in December 2019, the accused had reiterated that “_\[t\]he total amount she received did not add up to more than_ _$10,000_”. This statement made, presumably with her agreement and specifically for purposes of her trial, was in fact entirely consistent with \[9\] of the accused’s earlier statement at P27. The consistency of this figure of $10,000, in both the accused’s statement in P27, and in her own Case for Defence filed so much later (specifically for the purpose of the trial) made it clear that the figure of $10,000 had always originated from the accused, and was not “an invention” of the recorder IO Michelle. This especially as IO Michelle would certainly have nothing to do with the Case for the Defence.

> (e)     Further, when the accused was asked why she had not amended the part of P27 which had mentioned the ranges “_$50 to $2000_” and “_around $3000_” to “_hundreds_” (which she claimed in court to be the correct position), the accused admitted that she could not provide an answer to this. In addition, even as the accused claimed in court to have actually told IO Michelle she had received “_hundreds_” from Ling, this could not explain why IO Michelle would then allegedly state the range of “_around $50 to $2000_” that appears at \[9\] of P27. To this, the accused even started to embellish her evidence by saying “_..._ **_maybe_** _\[IO Michelle\] asked would it be more than 50 ... I can’t remember why the 50 was there_”

> (f)     The accused also tried to make the excuse that she had not made amendments to the alleged errors in P27, as she “_wasn’t really into great detail_” in amending P27 because her “_mental state wasn’t 100% at that time_”. This was allegedly because she had rushed back to Singapore to see her hospitalised grandmother who passed away on 24 March 2015. However, her claim rings hollow, when it could be seen that it was the accused herself who had chosen to give her statement (P27) on 27 March 2015, instead of doing so at a later or different date. Further, the accused admitted that she had not told IO Michelle that her mental state was (allegedly) not 100% at that time. Moreover, it was undisputed that at \[1\] of P27, it was indicated that the accused was “_feeling well and comfortable to give \[her\] statement_”. In court, the accused also admitted that \`health-wise’, she was able to attend the interview.

86     I also considered the circumstances surrounding the recording of P27, and the safeguards adopted in its recording. Specifically, I took into account the following admissions of the accused about the recording process, which clearly fortified the accuracy and reliability of P27.

> (a)     P27 was recorded in the accused’s choice of language, which was the English language, and she was able to express herself clearly in that language. In fact, I note that the accused subsequently also freely and voluntarily chose to give her account in her cautioned statement (D2) also in English. This was particularly significant since D2 was an exhibit which the accused relied on in arguing that the monies received by her from Ling were for festive reasons.

> (b)     In addition, it was not disputed that what was recorded in P27 were largely her own words. The accused also confirmed that she told the truth in P27.

> (c)     Further, the accused was allowed breaks during the recording process for P27. In addition, she was also given sufficient time to read over P27, and to freely amend P27 before she signed on it.

> (d)     Finally, as stated above, that the accused was lucid, clear and careful when giving her account in P27, this was demonstrated by the fact that she had in fact made detailed amendments, such as the 5 lines of handwritten text at \[13\], and the extensive cancellations and additions made at \[23\] of P27. In addition, she had made other amendments at \[8\] and \[19\] of P27. These were essentially all important amendments on matters of substance, as opposed to minor amendments or amendments made merely to correct editorial or grammatical errors. Clearly, in coming up with her statement P27, the accused knew what she wanted to say and how to say it, as well as what she wanted to amend or to remove.

87     Separately, I also accepted the Prosecution’s argument that the accused was not in any position to challenge the Prosecution’s evidence on the issue of the number of occasions that she had received money from Ling.

> (a)     This was because the accused had admitted in court that even at the time that P27 was recorded from her (on 27 March 2015), she already could not recall how many times she had received money from Ling. Hence, as the accused had also agreed that it was “_human nature_” that human memory can only deteriorate with time, there was no basis to suggest that her memory when she testified in 2021, would have been better than it was in 2015 when P27 was recorded.

> (b)     It thus follows that the accused’s claim, only made in court in 2021 when she testified, that she did not receive money on more than two occasions from Ling, was belated, unsubstantiated, and clearly could be believed. This was especially so since the accused admitted that she did not keep any record of the monies Ling had given her. Indeed, even as late as 4 January 2019, when she gave her cautioned statement D2 to the CPIB, she had voluntarily stated that she “can’t recall how many times he \[Ling\] had passed any token to \[her\]”. Thus, it follows that if the accused could not remember, even in 2019 when giving her cautioned statement , about how many times Ling had given her money, how could she do so in 2021 ? This was so especially when one remembers that the accused was given full liberty to says in D2 whatever she wanted to say, in response to the charges, and yet did not say how many times Ling had passed money to her. In such a case, it was ridiculous for her to claim - in court in 2021 – so much later after Ling had given her the gratifications, that she was sure that she did not receive money on more than two occasions.

> (c)     Furthermore, in her Case for the Defence filed on 12 December 2019, the accused had maintained at \[20\] that she was unable to recall the exact number of times she received money from Ling.[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17) This was similar to the position she took when she gave her statements in P27, and in D2. Further, her Case for the Defence, she also reiterated that “_\[t\]he total amount she received did not add up to more than $10,000_”. This was again similar to the account that she had made in P27. Nowhere, however, did she say that she only receive money from Ling that were in the “hundreds”.

> (d)     Thus, that the accused only shifted her evidence and gave wholly favourable, but belated and unsubstantiated account when it was her turn to testify, strongly suggested that accounts given in court at the eleventh hour were almost certainly recent afterthoughts. Indeed, if the accused had not received the gratifications on numerous occasions as alleged by the Prosecution, but had merely received the monies on no more than two occasions, I fail to see why the accused would not have mentioned this essential fact in any of the documents – whether the long statement P27 recorded from her in the course of investigations on 27 March 2015, or the cautioned statement D2 recorded from her on 4 January 2019 in response to specific allegations set out in the 11 charges, or in the Case for the Defence that was specifically prepared, and filed in December 2019 for the purposes of the present trial. I thus rejected the accused’s belated and uncorroborated claim, made only in court, that she received gratifications on no more than two occasions.

88     Aside from the reasons above why I rejected the accused’s attempt to cast doubt on the accuracy and reliability of her statement P27, there were other reasons why I accepted the incriminating portions of P27 to be broadly reflecting the truth of the matter.

89     First, P27 was a mixed statement from the accused.

> (a)     In this regard, there were various admissions made by the accused in P27, such as her acknowledgement of having accepted and kept the money received from Ling on various occasions, her disclosure that she “**understood**” that the sums of money were given to her by Ling in “…appreciation for recommending and referring jobs to TAC” ((see \[9\] and \[32\] of P27); her recognition that there was a conflict of interest in accepting the money from a contractor like Ling (see \[9\] of P27), and her admission that she had asked for and received support quotations from TAC without knowing whether those quotations were from real companies (see \[10\] of P27, and also \[31\] of P27).

> (b)     Nevertheless, the accused also denied other specific aspects and allegations against her, and apparently sought to downplay the significance or seriousness of her acts, showed that she was consciously trying to protect her own interests. For example, she claimed to have believed that the total amount that she accepted was less than $10,000, and that each time Ling gave her money, the sum was around $50 to $2,000 and did not exceed $5,000. She also denied and/or cast doubt on her role in the calling of quotations for specific jobs, and/or in the award of contracts to TAC and its related companies.

90     However, as has been made clear by the Court of Appeal decision in _Chan Kin Choi v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1991\] 1 SLR(R) 111</span>, in respect of a mixed statement (such as P27), both the incriminating and the exculpatory parts of a mixed statement should be considered by the trial judge in determining where the truth lay, although it would usually be the case that the incriminating parts were likely to be true whereas excuses would not carry the same weight: (see \[34\] and \[35\]).

91     In line with the above factors, and the guidance of the Court of Appeal, I found it completely unreasonable to accept the accused’s bare claim in court that _everything_ that she had stated in P27 was information which she had given to IO Michelle, _save for the portions which are not in her favour_. The latter included the range of the amount of gratification which she had received from Ling that are recorded at \[9\] of P27.

92     I found it particularly difficult to accept the accused’s denials when the incriminating accounts of the accused in P27 were largely corroborated by the incriminating statements P26-1 to P26-6 that the Ling had consistently maintained when he gave evidence to the CPIB in 2014 and 2015, and when he pleaded guilty and was sentenced in 2016. In contrast, the accused’s denials and self-serving aspects of her evidence in court, as I have set out above, were completely uncorroborated and unbelievable.

93     All in all, the overwhelming evidence emanating from the accused’s statements and her testimony in court, was consistent with Ling’s evidence from his statements and records, concerning the accused’s acceptance of monies from Ling. Clearly, she had taken such sums of gratification on significantly more times than the two occasions that she belatedly claimed in court.

### Mens Rea requirements and related issues

94     As set out by the CA at \[20\] of _Leng Keng Poh_, the _mens rea_ for a s 6(a) PCA offence consists of three elements:

> (a)     Gratification as an inducement or reward (for any act, favour or disfavour to any person in relation to the recipient's principal's affairs or business);

> (b)     There was an objective corrupt element in the transaction; and

> (c)     The recipient accepted the gratification with guilty knowledge

95     The CA had further said at \[43\] that, “... the correct approach is to ask the question: was there a gratification by inducement or reward to the agent that led to a dishonest or improper gain or advantage being conferred by the agent on the third party?”

96     Further, as noted by Tay J (as he then was) in _Mark Tjong_ at \[29\]: “To prove corruption in cases where gratification was received after the allegedly corrupt conduct had happened, the evidence must at least allow the court to infer that the idea of gratification was already operating in the accused's mind.”

#### Corrupt element in the transaction

97     In the present case, it was clear that the accused did receive and accept monies given by Ling in the form of white envelopes. The accused also admitted that it was wrong to have accepted the monies from Ling. [\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18) The main areas of dispute were really how many such envelopes of money did she receive from him, how much the envelopes contained, and whether the alleged charges - setting out specific occasions when she received monies, the sums she received, and the nature of the monies received as rewards in connection with specific MCSTs – were made out.

98     As regards ascertaining whether there was a corrupt element in the transaction, this should be approached in line with the two-part framework endorsed by Tay Yong Kwang J (as he then was) in _Mark Tjong_. His Honour had made clear that there was a need to ascertain the intention of the giver or receiver (as the case may be) behind the transaction at the material time, and to determine whether such an intention tainted the transaction with an objectively-corrupt element, given the factual matrix. Further, the Court in _Leng Kah Poh_ had stated at \[24\] that where the intent is to cause an agent to act against the principal's interests, or to act in favour of the giver's interests, this would inform the presence of an objectively corrupt element.

99     In the present case, the evidence of the accused ,as regards her intention, vis-à-vis her acceptance of the monies given by Ling, coupled with the other factual circumstances of the case, left little doubt that there was a corrupt element in the transaction, since the actions of the accused would be against the principal’s interest, in referring/recommending jobs to Ling’s companies when there were other potential contractors from the list of potential contractors kept by Newman & Goh that she could refer or recommend the jobs to, or in favour of Ling’s interests, in that the jobs from the MCSTs would be referred and recommended to his companies.

100    I summarise the evidence below.

> (a)     First, the accused admitted that she knew that there was a conflict of interest in accepting the money from a contractor like Ling (see \[9\] of P27). She also specifically accepted that she should not have accepted money from him because of this conflict of interest. (at \[33\] of P27). Further, she acknowledged that Newman & Goh would not have allowed her to receive the monies from Ling in respect of jobs which were paid for by the MCST (at \[34QA8 and 34QA10\]), precisely because of this conflict of interest (at \[34QA9\]). Indeed, this undisputed conflict of interest that the accused was keenly aware of, which she promptly disregarded by repeatedly accepting money from Ling, demonstrated the corrupt element in the transaction. As noted by the CA in _Leng Kah Poh_ at \[35\] that “(t)he broad scope of s 6(a) is meant to protect the fidelity of the agent/principal relationship which through the gift (or a promise of it) the third party intends to subvert...”. It was this fidelity that Ling subverted with the full co-operation and connivance of the accused.

> (b)     Next, it has to be noted that the accused was clearly in a position to be able to influence whether or not TAC and its related companies would be awarded jobs by the MCSTs. In this regard, from a list of possible contractors maintained by Newman & Goh, she chose to select Ling’s companies (TAC and its related companies) and ask them to quote for the jobs to them. She could also recommend and refer the jobs to Ling’s companies, and possibly even influence the selection when she summarised the quotes from the various contractors when putting them up to the MCSTs for selection, since the recommendation of the managing agent (i.e. the accused) would be provided to the MCSTs in deciding on the choice of contractor (see the accused’s admissions at \[3\] of P27).

> (c)     In addition, the accused also admitted that she had asked for and received support quotations from Ling’s company, TAC (which were requested by the MCST), without even knowing whether the quotations were from real companies (see \[10\] of P27). As this was another crucial aspect of the process by which the appropriate contractor was to be selected to carry out the job, the actions of the accused could also further advance the interests of TAC and its related companies, which was the favour that the accused that was performed, that would clearly be against her principal’s interest and/or be in Ling’s interest. It would appear that the accused’s lack of actual scrutiny over these quotations provided by TAC, which was part of the process by which TAC would be identified and selected to carry out the job, was accompanied by gratification from Ling to her. This further cemented the character of the money accepted by the accused from Ling as corrupt rewards.

101    In addition, I considered that there was other evidence pointing to the corrupt nature of the transaction. For one, consistent with the accused’s own awareness of the fact that she should not accept such monies from contractors, the evidence of her superior Cheng Wee Hong@ Dennis, who was the executive director at Newman & Goh, also confirmed the illicit nature of such gratifications.

> (a)     For one, Dennis confirmed that managing agents, such as the accused, were not allowed to receive money from contractors who perform works at the estates under their charge. This was because the managing agents have to be transparent and to act in the best interest of the MCST in getting quotations for the works to be carried out, and any savings obtained should go to the client. As such, the managing agent was not supposed to take additional money from a contractor in order to influence the MCST to get the contractor for the job.

> (b)     Dennis further said that the accused knew that she was not allowed to receive money, as Newman & Goh constantly updated during their meetings that such acts were illegal and should not be carried out.

> (c)     Dennis also said that even if the accused did receive money, she was supposed to declare this to the company. He confirmed that during her employment with Newman & Goh, the accused had never declared to Newman & Goh that she received money from contractors.

102    In addition, it was also clear from Ling’s evidence that the gratifications that he had given to the accused were not _bona fide_ gifts, but were instead provided to her as rewards in connection with jobs that he was granted with the estates that the accused was managing. In this regard,

> (a)     The gratifications were in the form of sums of cash, and the cash would also be placed in white envelopes, rather than paid through other modes that would have left a paper trail.

> (b)     The sums were of relatively significant sums when compared to, and proportionate to the value of the jobs.

> (c)     Ling also personally handed the monies to the accused himself, rather than have this done by his employees who would then be aware of such payments being made to the accused.

> (d)     The gratifications were made in this manner even though there was no evidence that the accused was someone with whom Ling enjoyed any particularly close or special relationship with. Indeed, the accused admitted in her statement P27 at \[9\] that at the time when she was first given money by Ling, their relationship was such that they “…only meet up for work reasons and not personally”.

103     _Prima facie_, it would thus appear that these transactions whereby cash was given by Ling, a contractor, to the accused who was managing the estates that Ling wanted to (and did in fact) provide services for, were objectively corrupt, and that there was thus a corrupt element in the transactions.

#### Gratification as a reward for favour shown

104    As regards the 1st to 10th charges framed under s 6(a) of the PCA, the Prosecution’s case was that the each gratification was given to the accused as a reward for favour shown to TAC and its related companies in relation to her principal’s or principals’ affairs, the principal(s) being the specific MCST or MCSTs named in each charge. The particulars of the favour shown by the accused was that the business interests of TAC and its related companies were advanced with the principal(s).

105    Based on the evidence adduced from Ling and the accused as set out earlier, including admissions that they made in court, there was a clear nexus between the gratifications accepted by the accused from Ling, and her role as the managing agent for the estates. I summarise this evidence below.

> (a)     From Ling’s statements in P26-1 to P26, as corroborated by the entries he made in P5A and P5B, Ling had made gratifications of the sums of money to the accused in connection with the estates whose MCSTs she was representing. There was also a formula that Ling had used to calculate the amount of the gratifications that he gave which was essentially based on the contract value of the jobs that TAC and its related companies performed for these MCSTs.

> (b)     In his statements, Ling also admitted that he had given these commissions to the managing agents (including the accused) as referral fees to thank them for their role in the award of the jobs, and also as he hoped for further awards in the future (see \[66\] of P26-2). Ling also explained the entries that he recorded of the specific payments that he made to the accused were in connection with her role as managing agent of those estates where his companies had been appointed for the jobs.

> (c)     In court, Ling testified that the purpose of giving money to the accused (and to the other managing agents) was as tokens of appreciation for helping his business. This was also stated at \[18\] of P4, the Statement of Facts which Ling admitted to in court when he pleaded guilty in 2016. In the present trial for the accused, Ling confirmed that P4 was accurate.

> (d)     In the accused’s statement P27, she had explained that when there were problems in the estates that they managed, the managing agents would contact contractors to assess the problems, and to submit quotes for the job. As a managing agent, **_she could choose the contractors_** for this purpose from a list maintained by Newman & Goh. Her job as a managing agent was also to summarise the quotes and **_provide recommendations_** to the MCSTs which would then decide on the award of the job (see \[3\] and \[4\] of P27). It was thus clear that the accused was in a position of influence and power, in that she could determine which contractors (from the list) would be selected/referred to provide a quote/for a job, and she could also influence the final award of the job through the recommendations she made to the MCSTs.

> (e)     The accused had admitted the corrupt nature of the gratifications she received from Ling, and the connection of such gratifications to the work that she performed in representing the MCSTs which had engaged Ling to perform work for them. Specifically, the accused had admitted that the money that she accepted from him was “_an appreciation for recommending and referring jobs to TAC_” (at \[9\] of P27), and that the monies were given as “_token(s) of appreciation for inviting TAC and referring jobs to TAC_” (at \[32\] of P27)/ “_token of appreciation for referring jobs to TAC_” (at \[34Q2A2\] of P27).

> (f)     In court, the accused admitted that the phrase “_appreciation for recommending and referring jobs to TAC_” at \[9\] of P27, as well as the phrases “_token of appreciation for inviting TAC and referring jobs to TAC_” at \[32\] of P27, and “_token of appreciation for referring jobs to TAC_” at \[34QA2\] of P27, were her own words. She further clarified that “_referring jobs_” refers to “_inviting them to quote for projects_”.

> (g)     In addition, at her trial, while disputing the number of times she received money from Ling, and the quantum of the money that she was given, she nonetheless acknowledged the connection of the gratifications from Ling, to the work that she performed as a managing agent, where she had to represent the MCSTs when interacting with TAC and its related companies. In this regard, the accused testified that the money was “_probably just a thank you”_ / “_just to thank you for the support_” / “_for appreciation of job awarded_” / “_an appreciation for supporting him or inviting him to quote for any project_”. Indeed, she also admitted to recommending TAC and its related companies to the MCSTs when there were jobs to be done.

106    Even for the 11th charge, which was amended to a charge under s 5(a)(i) PCA, while reference was not specifically made to the MCSTs named in the charge as being principals of the accused. or to the accused as acting as their agent, the alleged acts of corruption were still the same i.e. that the accused had in the course of representing the MCSTs, showed favour to TAC and its related companies for which Ling had rewarded her.

107    In any event, I agreed with the Prosecution that it does not have to show that the accused had actually done anything to advance the business interest of TAC and its related companies with the relevant MCSTs. This was because of the operation of s 9(1) PCA in respect of the 1st to 10th charges, and the requirements set out in s 5(1) PCA. It is to s 9(1) PCA I now turn to discuss.

##### (1)   Sections 6(a) and s 9(1) PCA: No need for favour to be shown

108    In submitting on whether the charges under s 6(a) PCA were made out, parties had put forward positions concerning the scope and operation of s 9(1) of the PCA. I reproduce section 9(1) PCA in its entirely below:

> 9.—(1)    Where in any proceedings against any agent for any offence under section 6(a), it is proved that he corruptly accepted, obtained or agreed to accept or attempted to obtain any gratification, having reason to believe or suspect that the gratification was offered as an inducement or reward for his doing of forbearing to do any act or for showing or forbearing to show any favour or disfavour to any person in relation to his principal’s affairs or business, he shall be guilty of an offence under that section notwithstanding that he did not have the power, right or opportunity to do so, show or forbear or that he accepted the gratification without intending to do so, show or forbear or that he did not in fact do so, show or forbear or that the act, favour or disfavour was not in relation to his principal’s affairs or business.

109    In _Pandiyan Thanaraju Rogers v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 2 SLR(R) 217</span> (“_Pandiyan Thanaraju Rogers_”), Yung Pung How CJ (as he then was) explained the scope and effect of s 9 PCA as follows:

> Mr Damodara also submitted that the appellant had merely rendered general advice and that there was no evidence that the appellant actually used his position as a police officer to render assistance to Manjit. This submission was misconceived. **_It is plain from the operation of s 9 of the PCA that it is not necessary for the appellant to have actually rendered any assistance_**. In _Fong Ser Joo William v PP_ (\[34\] supra at \[26\]) which also involved a charge under s 6(a) of the PCA, I had expressly recognised that **_it is not necessary to prove the actual act of showing favour. Rather, it is the receipt of the gratification, together with the intention of the giver and the recipient that is crucial._**

\[emphasis added\]

110    Indeed in earlier case of _Fong Ser Joo William v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 3 SLR(R) 12</span> (“_Fong Ser Joo William_”), Yong Pung How CJ had similarly stated at \[26\]:

> **_It should also be noted that in finding corruption under s 6(a) of the Act, it is not even necessary to prove the actual act of showing favour_**. The principle that one can be guilty of taking a bribe, even if it is not proved that he has shown favour, was recognised in R v Carr <span class="citation">\[1957\] 1 WLR 165</span>, Krishna Jayaram v PP <span class="citation">\[1989\] 2 SLR(R) 21</span> at \[13\] and R v Mills (1978) 68 Cr App R 154 at 158–159. **_It is the receipt of the gratification, together with the intention of the giver and the recipient, that is material._** Indeed, s 9(1) of the Act states as follows…

\[emphasis added\]

111    In the more recent case of _Public Prosecutor v Victorine Noella Wijeysingha_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 2 SLR 1001</span> (“_Victorine Noella Wijeysingha”_), Choo Han Teck J, in discussing the relationship between s 6(a) and s 9(1) PCA, similarly stressed the importance of considering the intention of the offender, and the need to look at whether there was knowledge or belief of the offender that the gratification was for a corrupt purpose, elements which have to be proven before s 9(1) PCA would operate. At \[4\], Choo J stated:

> **_Section 6(a) is concerned with corrupt bargains – there must be an objectively corrupt element in the transaction and guilty knowledge on the part of the recipient in accepting the gratification_**: _Kwang Boon Keong Peter v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 2 SLR(R) 211</span> at \[32\]. I agree with the submissions of the DPP that the focus of s 6(a) is on whether the accused accepted the gratification as an inducement knowing or believing it to be for a corrupt purpose, but the onus in every case is on the Prosecution to prove this mens rea element beyond reasonable doubt. The relevant intention of the accused may be inferred from all the surrounding circumstances, including the facts relating to whether the person offering the gratification could and would have subjectively intended to offer an inducement, whether both parties believed that the object of the inducement could be carried out, and whether the object was in fact carried out. The subjective intention of the accused in accepting or obtaining the gratification need not, and in many cases, cannot, be assessed in isolation. **_Section 9(1) does not qualify the requisite elements in s 6(a) and the requirement that guilty knowledge must be proven by the Prosecution; this section provides that the guilty knowledge is directed towards the acceptance of the corrupt bargain and that_** **_an offence under s 6(a) does not require the actual or intended performance of the purpose of the corrupt bargain._** **_Section 9(1) therefore applies after the elements of the s 6(a) offence have been prima facie satisfied_**_, and does not limit the scope of the court’s inquiry in s 6(a) in relation to the inferences that may be drawn from all the relevant facts._

\[emphasis added\]

112    Thus, as with Yong CJ in the aforementioned cases of _Pandiyan Thanaraju Rogers_ and _Fong Ser Joo William_, Choo J made it clear at \[4\] of _Victorine Noella Wijeysingha_ that “…an offence under s 6(a) does not require the actual or intended performance of the purpose of the corrupt bargain_.”_

113    In summary, putting in place the guidance of the courts in the above cases, and bearing in mind the wording of the relevant provisions, it was clear that in the context of s 6(a) PCA and s 9(1) PCA:

> (a)     Where an offender corruptly accepts a gratification, in that there was an objectively corrupt element in the transaction and guilty knowledge on the part of the offender in accepting the gratification (see _Victorine Noella Wijeysingha_ applying _Kwang Boon Keong Peter);_ and

> (b)     The offender **_had reason to believe or suspect_** that the gratification was **_offered as a reward_** for his doing of forbearing to do any act or **_for showing_** or forbearing to show **_any favour_** or disfavour to any person in relation to his principal’s affairs or business, **_that offender shall be guilty_** of the s 6 PCA offence **_notwithstanding that_**:

>> (i)       He did not have the power, right or opportunity to do so, show or forbear (to do the act or favour or disfavour);

>> (ii)       He accepted the gratification without intending to do so, show or forbear (the act or favour or disfavour);

>> (iii)        **_He did not in fact_** do so, **_show_** or forbear (the act or **_favour_** or disfavour); or

>> (iv)       The act, favour or disfavour was not in relation to his principal’s affairs or business.

>> (applying the wording of s 9(1) PCA)

114    I would add that in _Mark Tjong’s_ case where, on the facts, there was no need for section 9(1) PCA to apply (since the act in relation to his principal’s affairs was actually shown to have been performed), the Court made it clear at \[21\] and \[22\], that if Tjong \[the receiver of money\] had showed favour when recommending Mujibur \[the giver\] and accepted gratification for it, whether Mujibur was appointed on the merits is irrelevant for the purposes of guilt. Instead, the court noted that “…since Tjong has to exercise his judgment in recommending Mujibur to STE, it is enough if Tjong was coloured by the contemplation of a reward”.

##### (2)   S 5(a)(i) PCA: No need for favour to be carried out

115    As for the 11th charge which was under a s5(a)(i) PCA, the Prosecution argued that one can be convicted of giving/receiving corrupt gratification for a proposed transaction that is objectively corrupt, as long as the transaction was formulated in one’s mind, and the offence is made out whether or not the favour sought was in fact carried out. In other words, it is an offence to corruptly receive or give gratification if it is _intended_ for a favour that is objectively corrupt, whether or not the favour sought had been carried out.

116    The Prosecution further argued that in the present case, as the accused had received the gratification as a reward to advance the business interests of TAC and its related companies with the named MCSTs, it need not matter whether she actually advanced their business interest. I agree.

> (a)     First, as noted by the Prosecution, s 5(a)(i) PCA makes it an offence where a person corruptly receives any gratification as a reward for doing “…anything in respect of any matter or transaction whatsoever, actual or **_proposed_**”. This means that it is sufficient if the act sought to be done by the receiver was proposed to be done, it does not actually have to be carried out. Such an interpretation, arising from the word “proposed”, was supported by the authorities cited by the Prosecution, including the Hong Kong decision of _Wong Hon-Kwong v The Queen_ \[1966\] HKLR 327 (“_Wong Hon-Kwong_”), a case which was cited and applied locally in _Ding Si Yang_. In _Wong Hon-Kwong_, the Hong Kong Full Court, in considering the meaning of the word “proposed” in s3(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Ordinance of Hong Kong30, a provision which is _in para materia_ with s5(a)(i) PCA, had held that “once a proposal has been made it is irrelevant that it may never be likely to materialise_.”_

> (b)     Further, such an interpretation - that the proposed act need never be carried out for the offence to be made out - was also consistent with the result in the local case of _Kannan s/o Kunjiraman v PP_ \[1995\] 3 SLR (R) 294. For that case, the giver, Rajendran, had offered to the two offenders, Kannan and Ong, money to bribe David Lee, a goalkeeper to assist in reducing the winning margin in a match. However, the favour was not actually carried out since the offer was never even made to David Lee, who thus did not know about it, nor did he act according to Rajendran’s purported wishes. Nevertheless, both Kannan and Ong were convicted of corruptly receiving the respective sums of money from Rajendran as a reward. The High Court there explained at \[19\] that “(a)s for the fact that the agreement was never carried into effect, I am of the view that it should not make a difference. The $5,000 was given as a reward for arranging a bribe to David Lee. When it was received it, \[Kannan\] knew that it was given on this basis.”

> (c)     Similarly in two other local cases, _Ding Si Yang_, and _Tang Keng Boon_, convictions under s5 of the PCA were recorded even though the favour in each case, was not actually carried out.

> (d)     Finally, in respect of the decisions of the High Court in two cases, namely in _PP v Tan Kok Ming Michael and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 926</span> at \[54\] to \[55\], and in _Song Meng Choon Andrew v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1090</span> at \[34\], it was emphasised that s5 PCA was introduced sometime after s6 PCA, and that the introduction of s5 PCA was done as a means of providing “_wider powers to fight bribery and corruption”._ It could thus even be argued that s6 offences are subsumed under s5, such that “\[a\] _court should not be overly concerned with whether a charge is brought under s5 or 6_”, and that s5 is wide enough to capture an agent’s corruption as well.[^19]

117    To sum up, for the 1st to 11th charges, it was sufficient for the Prosecution to show that when the accused corruptly accepted the gratification from Ling, the gratification was given to her as a reward for her showing favour to TAC and its related companies for advancing their business interests in relation to the affairs of the accused’s named principal(s), and that there was no need to further prove that she did in fact show favour to TAC and its related companies or that she did in fact advance the business interest of TAC and its related companies.

##### (3)   Setting out the specific favour to be performed

118    As regards the issue of whether the favour was sufficiently specified in each of the s 6(a) PCA charge by the Prosecution’s words “to advance the business interest of TAC Contracts Pte Ltd and its related companies”, I agreed with the Prosecution that this was indeed the case here.

> (a)     For one, as correctly pointed out by the Prosecution, charges with similar wording have been upheld by the High Court in corruption cases such as _PP v Kong Swee Eng_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGHC 6</span> (where the favour indicated was “to advance your business interests with JSPL”) involving s 6(b) PCA charges, and in _PP v Wong Chee Meng and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 144</span> (where the favour indicated was “advancing the business interests of \[the Companies\] with AMKTC”).

> (b)     Further, the accused here had acknowledged that she had various interactions with Ling’s companies, whom she admittedly referred to, and recommended for the jobs that the MCSTs required a contractor to perform. The accused also confessed that she understood the gratifications from him were “_for recommending and referring jobs to TAC_” (see \[9\] and \[32\] of P27). The evidence thus showed that her actions amounted to favours carried out by her to advance the business interest of TAC and its related companies. Similarly, Ling’s evidence what that the money given to managing agents like the accused, was for their helping his business.

> (c)     While Ling and the accused had apparently never discussed exactly how the accused had advanced the business interest of TAC and its related companies, the common nexus between the giver (Ling) and the receiver (the accused), was that the gratification was given to the accused for the help she had rendered to TAC and its related companies in relation to securing jobs, thus advancing their business interests.

119    All in all, I saw no issue or ambiguity with respect to the drafting of the s 6(a) PCA charges.

##### (4)   The accused can be an agent of the MCSTs even while employed by Newman & Goh

120    The Prosecution submitted that as regards the 1st – 10th charges under s6 PCA, in light of the definition of “agent” in s2 of the PCA, it was correct to indicate the accused to be an agent of the various MCSTs named in the charges, even though the accused was an employee of Newman & Goh at the time she represented the MCST(s). I agree with the Prosecution.

121    In this regard, I note the very broad definition of “agent” in s 2 PCA as “_any person employed by_ **_or_** _acting for another ..._”. In the context of the charges under s6 PCA, while the accused was, strictly speaking, employed by Newman & Goh and not the MCSTs when she purportedly dealt with the accused, she was clearly “acting for” the latter (within the meaning of section 2), and taking instructions from them, something which was not disputed. In this regard, as noted at \[2\] and \[3\] of the accused’s statement P27, the accused admitted that she handled the day-to-day running of the estates that she was deployed at, and that she did all these for and on behalf of the MCSTs, and also dealt with the contractors as the representative of the MCSTs for their estates.

122    I also note that the facts of the present case were similar to those in _PP v Tai Ai Poh_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGDC 474</span> (Magistrate’s Appeal No 9046 of 2014). There, the offender was an employee of ExcelTec, which was a company in the business of providing property management services, including for the MCST of the Enterprise Centre and The Spire (‘the Buildings”). As an employee of ExcelTec, the offender was appointed as the building manager of the Buildings, and in that capacity, he reported to and took instructions from the MCST. The offender was subsequently charged with and convicted of corruption charges under s 6(a) PCA, for corruptly obtaining gratification of $300/- on each of 25 occasions from one Yusof, the sole proprietor of M/s Call and Care Services (“the Firm”). The gratification was given to the offender as an inducement for his forbearing to show disfavour to Yusof by refraining from providing negative feedback to the MCST about the cleaning services provided by the Firm. In essence, this was similar to the allegation brought against the current accused who, when employed by another property management firm, Newman & Goh, was similarly appointed to represent and take instructions from the various MCSTs of the various estates that Newman & Goh provided property management services for.

123    Thus, I was satisfied that in the context of the s 6(a) PCA charges, the accused could act as an agent on behalf of the MCSTs when dealing with Ling, and that any money that she took from him for favours she showed to TAC and its related companies, could be regarded as rewards given to her in relation to her principal’s or principals’ affairs (depending on how many MCSTs are named in the particular charge).

##### (5)   No need for accused to know the exact MCST or job involved

124    For each charge against the accused, the gratification was allegedly given to her for advancing the business interest of TAC and its related companies. While the charges specified the MCSTs whom Ling had rewarded the accused for advancing his companies’ business interests with, there was no evidence that when Ling passed her each gratification, he had explicitly informed the accused about the specific job or the exact estate/MCST that he was rewarding her for.

125    On the issue of whether the accused has to be aware, or whether she has to be specifically informed by Ling about which of the MCSTs, jobs or estates that she was being rewarded for, the Prosecution argued that there was no such requirement in law, and that the accused’s lack of awareness of such details does not preclude a finding of guilt. I agree.

126    I turn first to _Mark Tjong’s_ case where at \[26\], Tay J had made it clear that a finding of corruption can be made even if there was no prior agreement or prior discussion by the parties. His Honour explained that:

> Corruption is often subtle and hard to detect. It would be undesirable if the mere lack of a discussion or agreement is fatal to a finding of corruption, since many instances of corruption could then be disguised as rewards after the event.

127    In the present case, the accused was clearly aware that she was being rewarded for showing favour to the accused in respect of his dealings with the MCSTs that she was representing (when she referred and recommended jobs to Ling’s companies). While she did not know the specific MCST, estate or job that Ling subsequently rewarded her for, this was only because Ling had not explicitly sat down and discussed or explained to her such details, a situation not unlike that in _Mark Tjong_.

128    Ling’s practice of not giving the accused details of the contract, and of not sitting down to discuss the details of the gratification, was not entirely surprising since such transactions were clearly not above board. In fact, as noted from Dennis Cheng’s evidence, the practice of contractors giving money to managing agents was specifically prohibited, something that the accused was aware of, and had acknowledged.

129    In fact, the accused also admitted to knowing that it was a conflict of interest to accepting money from contractors which performed jobs for the MCSTs that the accused herself represented. It was thus, no wonder that the accused herself did not ask Ling for details of the gratification, or discuss with him particulars of the monies that Ling gave to her in cash. The furtive nature of these transactions was such that each time upon receiving the cash from Ling in the white envelopes that he passed to her, the accused did not declare them, but simply accepted and pocketed the cash, and later spent it.

130    In short, given the subtle and secretive nature of corruption offences as a whole, the resulting lack of discussion or any specific agreement between givers and receivers, such as Ling and the accused, in corrupt transactions was unsurprisingly. I thus agreed that there should not be any need to prove that the accused, as a receiver of the monies, knew about the specific job, MCST(s) or estate that each gratification was connected with, before the offence could be made out.

131    Such a requirement, if imposed, would be impractical and unduly onerous, as it would mean that the recipient of corrupt monies could simply get off by deliberately closing his eyes, and refraining from asking questions when receiving the corrupt sums. He would then be able to take bribes from corrupt givers with impunity (even if he had the requisite guilty knowledge of the corrupt nature of the money received) merely by insisting that the giver not give him specific details concerning each sum of gratification. This cannot be the state of the law.

132    I would add that my conclusion was also fortified by the decision in _Mark Tjong_, a case that I had previously referred to, where the High Court, in reversing a finding of acquittal on a charge of corruption and upholding the conviction on another corruption charge, found the offender, Tjong, a recipient of monies, to be guilty of corruptly obtaining two sums of gratification as an agent under s 6(a) of the PCA.

133    The facts of the case was that Tjong, who dealt with the giver, Mujibur in Bangladesh, was his principal’s only presence in that country. It was held that Mujibur must have known of the level of influence that Tjong enjoyed in respect of his principal’s affairs (see \[33\] of _Mark Tjong_). Tjong helped Mujibur to win the tender for the project, and the court held that Tjong must have known about the business practice of sharing profits in Bangladesh given that he had been in Bangladesh for about 2½ years. When Mujibur wanted to share profits with Tjong, there was no suggestion that Tjong was taken aback, refused or asked him why. Instead, he went along and said that both of them would benefit.

134    There were clear similarities between Tjong in _Mark Tjong’s_ case, and the accused in the present case:

> (a)     First, the accused did deal with Ling, and was the representative of the MCST in doing so.

> (b)     Second, given her knowledge of her duties as a senior property executive of Newman & Goh, who was deployed at the various estates, (see in \[3\] – \[6\] of her statement P27), she would have known of her ability to advance the business interests of TAC and its related companies through referring jobs to them, or specifically inviting them to quote for jobs at the estates under her care, and of recommending TAC and its related company to her MCSTs. This was something admitted by her in P27 when explaining the reasons why she believed that Ling had given her the gratification.

> (c)     Finally, similar to Mujibur in _Mark Tjong_, Ling had testified that it was “_market practice_” or “culture practice” “_commonly \[practised\] among \[his\] peers or competitors_” to give the referral fees that he did. In this regard, as highlighted by the Prosecution, the accused in the present case, had been in the property management industry since 2004 and she had also dealt with Ling for work since 2006 /2007 (see P27 at \[7\]). As such, the market practice of contractors giving referral fees to agents that was alluded to by Ling, would also have been known to her.

> (d)     Indeed, this was confirmed by the accused’s admissions in P27 that when Ling passed her the referral fees for the first time, she immediately understood that the money was an appreciation for “recommending and referring jobs to TAC”, even though there was no explicit conversation between them about what the money was for (see P27 at \[9\] and \[32\]). As a result of such an understanding, the accused did not reject or return the monies given by Ling. Instead, she accepted each gratification, kept it and used it instead.

> (e)     Thus, it was clearly sufficient for the accused to have known of the corrupt nature of the gratification given to her, and that it was related to her dealings with him as an agent of the MCSTs that engaged his services, without needing to explicitly link each gratification to a specific job, estate or MCST.

135    Finally, I would add that my conclusion was consistent with the decision of Yong CJ in _Fong Ser Joo William_. At \[25\], Yong CJ made it clear that “… it was not necessary for the Prosecution to prove that the appellant’s receipt of money from Chua was an inducement for a specific corrupt act or favour.”

##### (6)   Requirement that accused has to be an agent of the named MCSTs when purporting to show favour

136    However, while there was no need to prove specific knowledge by the accused of the particular job, MCST, or estate for which she was being rewarded by Ling for, I was of the view that the Prosecution would still need to show that the accused was in fact acting as an agent for the particular MCST(s) referred to in the charge, at the point that she was supposed to be showing favour to Ling’s companies, since this was what Ling subsequently rewarded her for. This issue was quite separate from there being no need to prove that she had actually shown favour to Ling’s companies because of the operation of s9(1) PCA.

137    In this regard, I noted the following:

> (a)     The evidence pointed to Ling rewarding the accused for her role essentially in being involved in procuring jobs from the MCSTs for his companies. As stated before, the accused herself admitted that the money that she accepted from Ling was “_an appreciation for recommending and referring jobs to TAC_” (at \[9\] of P27), and given as “_token of appreciation for inviting TAC and referring jobs to TAC_” (at \[32\] of P27)/ “_token of appreciation for referring jobs to TAC_” (at \[34QA2\] of P27).

> (b)     Thus, the crucial time to consider the question whether the accused was, in fact, acting for the particular MCST, was at the point when the selection of the contractor for the specific job was being carried out. It was also at that time that the accused could have performed the favour, and could recommend and/or refer jobs to TAC and its related companies, _whether she did or did not in fact do so_. In other words, it has to be shown that a particular MCST was in fact, the accused’s principal at this material point in time.

> (c)     I was of the view that this was a critical consideration since, if the accused was not even the Newman & Goh representative handling the estate for the MCST, or if she was not representing the MCST at that time, it could hardly be said that she was acting in relation to affairs of that MCST, who was her purported principal at that time. Nor could it be said that vis-à-vis that particular MCST or estate., “…the idea of gratification was already operating in the accused's mind.” (see _Mark Tjong_ at \[29\]).

> (d)     In the same way, without proof that the accused was acting as an agent for the particular principal at the time when Ling’s companies were being referred and/or recommended for the job, it could not be said that the gratification was a reward to the accused for the “…dishonest or improper gain or advantage being conferred by \[her\] on the third party” (see \[43\] of _Leng Keng Poh)._

> (e)     To that extent, I agreed with the position put forward by the Defence that the relevant time to consider, should be when the accused had the opportunity to influence the transaction. Practically speaking, this would be at or around the time that the contractor for the job was being selected, and/or quotations were being sought for the job that the MCST wanted performed for the estate.[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20)

138    This requirement of proof that the accused was in fact representing the particular MCST(s) identified in the charge, _at the point when she was referring and recommending jobs to TAC and its related companies_, would also satisfy the second element of a corruption offence under 6(a) PCA, namely that the gratification was a reward for any act, favour or disfavour to any person in relation to the recipient's principal's affairs or business.

#### Guilty Knowledge

139    I move on the final element that has to be proven for a s 6(a) and 5(a)(i) PCA offence, that of proof of guilty knowledge on the part of the offender.

140    In the present case, as alluded to earlier, the accused admitted that she knew that she should not have accepted money from PW1 because it was a conflict of interest for her to do so (P27 at \[33\]). She also knew that Newman & Goh would not have allowed her to accept the money given to her by Ling, when awarding jobs for the common areas of the estate, that was being paid for by the MCST (at \[34Q8A8 and 34Q10A10\]) because there was a conflict of interest for her to do so (at \[34Q9A9\]).

141    In short, the issue of guilty knowledge on her part, was perhaps the most obvious of the elements that was proven by the evidence.

## Whether each charge has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt

142    Having dealt with the _actus reus_ and _mens re_a requirements in general, I now move on to consider whether as regards each and every charge, the Prosecution has proven the offence beyond a reasonable doubt.

143    In this regard, the Defence had alleged that the 11 charges were improbable or unlikely for various reasons, including the fact that there was insufficient proof that the accused was deployed at the relevant estates when she received the gratification from Ling.

144    In response, the Prosecution argued that while P32 – P38 do not assist in showing when the accused was in charge of the properties which she was deployed in the course of her employment at Newman & Goh, a purposive interpretation of s6(a) PCA allows the 1st – 10th charges against the accused to be made out, since section 6 PCA does not require that an offender has to be an agent _at the point of time he / she accepted the gratification_, and that it is sufficient to make out a s 6(a) PCA offence if it could be shown that the offender had accepted gratification by virtue of her position as an agent. Further, in the current case, this approach would resonate with Ling’s assertion at \[759\] of P26-7 that he had given the referral fee to the accused as she was in charge of the sites, and with the accused’s belief that she was given the money because she had referred jobs to Ling’s companies when acting for the MCSTs.

145    Alternatively, if this argument was not accepted, the Prosecution argued that the 1st to 10th charges could be amended to s5(a)((i) PCA, and a fresh consent would not be needed as the amended charges are based on the same set of material facts. Neither would s 5(a)(i) PCA charges be more serious than the s6(a) PCA charges (citing _Mark Tjong_ at \[12\]).

146    Before delving into whether each charge has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, I would first refer to a recent publication on corruption in Singapore, where the author, Tan Boon Gin,[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21) had described the paradigm of corruption as a situation involving three parties: A, the briber; B, the recipient of the bribe; and C, the person to whom B owes a duty. He had explained that the purpose of A bribing B is to cause B to act in A’s interest, and against the interest of C, in breach of B’s duty. In the context of s 6 PCA, B is referred to as the agent, C as the principal, and the bribe as a gratification.

147    In line with the above understanding, and based on a purposive reading of s6(a) PCA, I agreed with the Prosecution that the critical time to assess the relationship between the agent (B) and the principal (C) is the time when he can act in the giver’s interest (i.e. A’s interest) and against the interest of his principal (C). In the context of gratification that was given as a reward, this would be the time that the offender was acting as an agent for the principal, and not the time that the reward was actually accepted. This would thus mean that it was not critical to show that the accused was still an agent of the particular MCST as at the date that she received the gratification.

148    However, this was not the end of the matter. As stated above, the Prosecution still has to show that the accused was in fact representing the MCST(s) at the time when she was in a position to act in Ling’s (i.e. the giver’s) interest, and against the interest of the MCST(s) (the principal). Otherwise, the money given to the accused by Ling, could hardly be said to constitute “reward for showing favour to TAC and its related companies in relation to your principal’s affairs” (see also discussion at \[136\]-\[138\] above).

149    With this issue made clear, I now move on to consider whether the Prosecution has successfully proven the elements of each charge beyond a reasonable doubt.

### 1st charge (invoice unknown)

150    The 1st Charge relates to the estate Spring@Katong (MCST No. 3206). Ling’s record was that he had received payment on 8 March 2011 for the job he performed, and hence would have given the gratification of S$500 to the accused sometime after this date.

151    The Defence argued that it would not have been possible for the transaction in the 1st charge to be corrupt, since Ling did not identify the projects that he had given commissions for. Hence, the accused would not have known anything, and there was no possibility of favour being shown, or of the transaction being tainted, nor would she have any guilty knowledge that there was a corrupt bargain.[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22)

152    I have already explained why I am of the view that there was no need to identify the specific job and/or estate/MCST for which the gratifications were given, especially in such a case where the gratification was given as a reward. Amongst other things, I came to this conclusion based on what was set out by the High Court in _Mark Tjong_, and in _Fong Ser Joo William_. However, this was not the end of the matter.

153    Instead, having carefully considered the evidence, and in line with my view that the accused must still be shown to be an agent of the MCST identified in the charge, I was of the view that there was insufficient evidence adduced to show that the accused was in fact, the agent representing this particular MCST (at Spring@Katong) at the point when TAC was being considered and/or referred the job. As discussed above, this was a critical requirement that has to be satisfied to make out the offence (see \[136\] –\[138\] above).

154    In this regard, I note the difficulties with the Prosecution’s evidence for this charge:

> (a)     First, for this particular job, there was no invoice recovered. There were only particulars of the work found in Ling’s diary (P5A), which indicated the invoice payment date to be 8 March 2011.

> (b)     While based on P31, it was indicated that the accused was in charge of this property sometime before a date in March 2011,[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23) there was, however, nothing to show:

>> (i)       That the accused was indeed the agent representing the MCST at the point when Ling’s company was referred to, and/or being considered for this particular job, especially as there was no evidence as to when the accused actually took over as managing agent of this estate, or when she started to represent this particular MCST (which would be when the MCST became her principal). Further, there was nothing to show that this date occurred before or at the time Ling’s company was being considered for this job.

>> (ii)       In this regard, I also note that the accused was not questioned about this particular job by the CPIB, nor, realistically, could she be, since no invoice was recovered for CPIB to ask her useful questions about. This was in contrast with other jobs in Spring@Katong, where the accused was specifically questioned about the jobs, using invoices that were recovered and which pertained to those jobs (see P27 at \[14\], \[15\] and \[24\]). It was only for the latter invoices/jobs that the accused was able to talk about whether she was involved with them, and/or whether that MCST was her principal at the time of the quote, or when the job came up for Ling’s companies to be referred/recommended.

>> (iii)       In fact, there was also no evidence as to when TAC or Ling was referred or recommended to the MCST for this job, or any evidence to show that the accused was even involved in this process. Hence, there was no causal or consequential link between the gratification to the accused with the purported favour in relation to her principal’s affairs.

> (c)     Without proof of this crucial element of s 6(a) being established on a _prima facie_ basis, s 9(1) of the PCA could not be invoked (see \[111) above). In short, the 1st charge under s 6(a) PCA was not made out.

155    I would also add that for many of the same reasons mentioned in \[152\] above, even if I was to amend the charge to one under s 5(a)(i) PCA, the offence would still not be made out because there remained insufficient evidence that the accused was in any way involved with this job for MCST 3206 (Spring@Katong), nor that she did (or was in a position) to favour and advance the business interest of TAC and its related companies, in relation to this job.

156    In any event, I was of the view that it would also not be appropriate at this stage to amend this 1st charge from one under s 6(a) PCA to one under s 5(a)(i) PCA, as suggested as an alternative approach by the Prosecution. I arrived at this conclusion as the requirements for making such an amendment were not satisfied (see \[32\] –\[33\]) for a discussion of these requirements). In this regard:

> (a)     The intended amended charge one under s 6(a) to s 5(a)(i) PCA was not readily apparent from the evidence already adduced before me.

> (b)     Further, for any amendment to an existing charge being considered at the end of the Defence’s case, a trial court should only do so on its own motion, if it is satisfied that were the Defence to adduce no further evidence, the accused person ought to be convicted on the intended amended charge.[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24)

> (c)     In addition, it would appear that there was a real risk that the accused would be prejudiced by the amendment since s 5 PCA “…is of a much wider remit than s 6” (see Sundaresh Menon CJ in _Wong Chee Meng_ at \[59\]). Thus, an amendment from one under s 6 PCA to s 5 PCA meant that there was a real risk that the accused would lack a sufficient opportunity to rebut the amended charge against him, especially as it could not be assumed that the defence the accused person has run in relation to the existing charge was likely to be substantially similar to the defence that the accused person may run in relation to the intended amended charge.[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25)

157    In summary, I was of the view that there was insufficient evidence adduced to prove the 1st charge beyond a reasonable doubt, and also no basis to consider amending it. I thus acquitted the accused of this charge.

### 2nd charge

158    The 2nd Charge states that the accused, being an agent, to wit, a senior property executive acting for Kew Gate (MCST No. 2246) and Peirce View (MCST No. 2085), had sometime after 18 March 2011 corruptly accepted gratification of S$2981 in cash from Donald Ling as a reward for showing favour to TAC and its related companies in relation to her principal’s affairs to advance the business interests of TAC and its related companies with Kew Gate (MCST No. 2246) and Peirce View (MCST No. 2085).

159    Based on Ling’s record in P5A, and his statements at P26-2 at \[124\] and P26-5 at \[580\] (for Kew Gate), and P26-2 at \[125\] and P26-5 at \[580\] (for Pierce View), Ling had given a total of $2,981 as a referral fee to the accused because she was a property executive at these estates. This gratification was made after 18 March 2011 (which was when he himself was paid for these jobs). In addition, Ling had explained that the amount that he had given to the accused for the project at Pierce View was “less than 10% of the contract value as the project profit margin for this job was quite low hence I can only afford to give her 5% of the contract value as a referral fee” (P26-2 at \[125\]).

160    Further, based on P31 to P38:[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26)

> (a)     The accused would have been in charge of Kew Gate when the quotations were called on 17 January 2011, when the invoice was sent on 26 January 2011, and when the invoice was paid on 18 March 2011.

> (b)     The accused would also have been in charge of Pierce View when the quotations were called on 17 January 2011, when the invoice was sent on 26 January 2011, and when the invoice was paid on 18 March 2011.

#### Kew Gardens (invoice P6)

161    Specifically, as regards Kew Gardens,

> (a)     The accused had admitted in her statement P27 at \[11\] that _she was the one who called for the quotes and invited TAC, Ling’s company, for this job_.

> (b)     While the Defence argued that there was a very active chairperson for Kew Gardens who would have personally liaised with the contractors, this did not detract from the fact that the accused had nonetheless advanced the interest of TAC and its related companies by referring the job and/or inviting Ling’s company for the tender. It was for this reason that she was rewarded.

> (c)     In this regard, I would add that the facts of his case were somewhat similar to those in _Mark Tjong’s_ case. It would be recalled that in that case, where section 9(1) PCA did not even need to be invoked, the Court had made it clear at \[21\] and \[22\], that if Tjong \[the receiver of money\] had showed favour when recommending Mujibur \[the giver\] and accepted gratification for it, whether Mujibur was appointed on the merits was irrelevant for the purposes of guilt. The court there further noted that “since Tjong has to exercise his judgment in recommending Mujibur to STE, it is enough if Tjong was coloured by the contemplation of a reward”.

> (d)     In the present case, this was the second occasion that the accused was being given money by Ling, having accepted money on an earlier occasion (which was the subject matter of the 1st charge). The money was also given to her for what she “understood” was for referring and recommending the jobs of the MCST to TAC.

> (e)     Rather than declare to Newman & Goh the money given to her by Ling, the accused had accepted, kept and used the gratification, despite knowing that it was wrong to do so. In short, after the first time she accepted money from Ling (which she should not have kept and used), the accused would have been coloured by the contemplation of a reward in her further dealings with him. Hence, her action in accepting the money on this second occasion was clearly corrupt.

162    Thus, so far as gratification, job and MCST were concerned, there was sufficient evidence adduced to make out this component of the charge.

#### Pierce View (likely related to invoice P15)

163    As regards Pierce View, the Defence essentially argued that:

> (a)     This invoice was likely related to invoice number 15 which pertained to the 7th Charge, in respect of the retention monies for the contract sum of $52,020.

> (b)     Thus, the tender for this job was likely to have started a few months before the accused joined Newman & Goh on 6 August 2010. Hence, the accused would have had no involvement in the calling, opening or evaluation of the tenders. Further, the award of the contract to TAC was because the latter agreed to the MCST’s request for additional works to be carried out at no additional costs and was hence awarded the contract.

> (c)     The accused’s involvement was limited to issuing the Letter of Award to TAC after the negotiations had been completed and a decision was made by the MCST to engage TAC. In short, there was no causal or consequential link between the gratification and the act of awarding the contract to TAC.

164    Having considered the evidence as a whole, in particular the evidence that this payment (at 5% of the contract value) was in relation to the contract set out in the 7th charge (and reflected in invoice P15), and for the reasons I have set out below why the 7th charge was not made out (see \[226\] – \[231\] of these Grounds of Decision), I agree with the Defence that there was also insufficient evidence to make out this component of the 2nd charge beyond a reasonable doubt. In this regard, as with the 1st charge, I was of the view that there was insufficient evidence to show that the accused was in fact, representing this particular MCST (Pierce View) i.e. acting as an agent for that principal for this job, at the point when the contractor for the job had to be sourced.

165    Thus, in so far as a s 6(a) PCA charge was concerned, it could not be shown, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the accused was acting in relation to her principal’s affairs for this MCST, or that she purportedly showed a favour to TAC and its related companies.

166    That was, however, not the end of the matter. I still had to consider whether I can, and should exercise my discretion under s 128(1) of the CPC to amend the 2nd charge, to “excise” this “failed” component of the charge. In this regard, parties took different positions:

> (a)     The Prosecution submitted that the court always has the discretion to amend a charge to one which it finds has been made out based on the evidence before it, and to thereafter convict an offender on the amended charge. Applying this principle for the 7 charges (including the 2nd charge) which involved referral fees for multiple jobs, the Prosecution argued that should the court find that part(s) of a charge could not be made out, the court could amend the charge by removing the individual referral fee pertaining to that particular job from the total amount of referral fees handed to the accused for that occasion.[\[note: 27\]](#Ftn_27)

> (b)     The Defence, however, submitted that where one part of the charge fails, the entire charge fails. In respect of the 7 charges which involve referral fees for different jobs, these charges were not equivalent to amalgamated charges under s 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code, Cap 68 (CPC). Hence, where corruption could not be proven for one of the jobs concerned in the charge, then the whole charge must fail.

> (c)     Notwithstanding this, the Defence, quite correctly, acknowledged that the court has the discretion to amend the charge under Section 128 of the CPC.[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28)

167    I have already discussed the requirements set out by the High Court in _Goh Chin Soon_ that has to be satisfied before a trial court can exercise its discretion to amend an existing charge on its own motion. To reiterate, amongst other things, the requirement is that the offence reflected in the intended amended charge must be readily apparent from the evidence already adduced before the trial court, and the Prosecution must have discharged its evidential burden of proof on the intended amended charge, bearing in mind the higher threshold to amend a charge at the close of the Defence’s case. The amendment must also not prejudice the accused person.

168    In the present case, the Prosecution’s case has always been that the gratification of $2,981 that was corruptly accepted by the accused from Ling, was for favours that were shown in relation to the affairs of her two principals i.e. the two separate MCSTs (MCST Nos. 2246 and 2085) for separate jobs related to their individual estates. This was patently obvious to the Defence, which had hence, methodically and systematically, argued why the _actus reus_ and _mens re_a elements for each “component” job and MCST, in respect of each of the charges naming multiple MCSTs, were not made out.

169    This would also mean that where:

> (a)     It has been established by the Prosecution that the essential elements of the s 6(a) PCA charge have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt in relation to one or more of the MCSTs named in any one charge, which for the 2nd charge the Prosecution had done so in the case of Kew Garden (MCST Nos. 2246): and

> (b)     the Prosecution could also clearly identify the amount of gratification given (and accepted) in connection with this “proven” component and MCST (in this case $380),

> then the court can, and indeed, should amend the charge to reflect the offence that has been proven.

170    This would be consistent with what Hoo J in _Goh Chin Soon_ at \[69\] had stated as a requirement before a trial judge amends the original charge on his own motion i.e. that “the offence reflected in the intended amended charge must be readily apparent from the evidence already adduced before the court”. Further, Yong Pung How CJ (as he then was) had also opined in _PP v Tan Khee Wan Iris_ <span class="citation">\[1994\] 3 SLR(R) 168</span> at \[7\] that where “the evidence available point\[s\] so obviously to the offence \[reflected in the intended amended charge”, the trial court “should \[exercise\] its discretion so as to amend the charge accordingly, unless the proposed amendment prejudice\[s\] the \[accused person\]”.

171    In line with the guidance set out in above cases, I amended the 2nd charge by essentially striking out reference to MCST 2085 (for Pierce View), and making the relevant amendment to the sum accepted by the accused in relation to the remaining MCST. The amended 2nd charge reads:

> You…are charged that you, being an agent, to wit, a Senior Property Executive acting for Management Corporation Strata Title (“MCST”) Nos. 2246 ~and 2085~, did, ~on or about~ sometime after 18 March 2011, in Singapore, corruptly accept gratification of ~S$2,981~ $380 in cash from one Ling Chun Teck Donald, a Director of TAC Contracts Pte Ltd, as a reward for showing favour to TAC Contracts Pte Ltd and its related companies in relation to your principals’ affairs, to wit, to advance the business interests of TAC Contracts Pte Ltd and its related companies with MCST Nos. 2246 ~and 2085~, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

172    On the issue of possible prejudice that may arise when an amendment to a charge is carried out at a late stage of the trial, Hoo J in _Goh Chin Soon_ had also commented at \[84\] that there would be no prejudice where “…the defence that the accused person has run in relation to the original charges is likely to be substantially similar to the defence that the accused person may run in relation to the amended charges.” Moreover, as noted by Hoo J, as “..the accused person will have the opportunity to supplement \[her\] defence if necessary whenever the charges are amended by the trial judge under s 128(1) CPC, \[she\] will not be prejudiced merely by the need to adduce a limited degree of additional evidence (especially if it relates to only one element of the offence which has changed or been added or subtracted) or to clarify the existing evidence.”

173    In the present case, the Defence has had the opportunity, and did in fact attempt to argue that for each charge (and each separate job and MCST connected with in the charge including for MCST 2246 (Kew Gate)), the _actus reus_ and _mens rea_ components were not satisfied. Thus, it was obvious that for the 2nd charge in relation to Kew Garden, the defence that the accused person had run in relation to that component of the previous (pre-amended) 2nd charge, was substantially similar to the defence that the accused may run in relation to the amended 2nd charge. Thus an amendment as set out above clearly did not prejudice the accused.

174    In fact, an amendment along the above lines effectively resulted in a less serious offence being framed against the accused, as it reduced the amount of gratification that the accused was said to have accepted, and it also made reference only to single principal i.e. MCST 2246 (Kew Gate). I would add that in any event, consistent with the guidance of the High Court in _Goh Chin Soon_, the accused was also given the opportunity to supplement her defence, if necessary, which opportunity she declined to take up.

175    Having re-amended the 2nd charge in the manner set out above, and having reviewed all the evidence adduced in relation to the re-amended 2nd charge, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case on the re-amended 2nd charge beyond a reasonable doubt, and I convicted her accordingly.

### 3rd charge

176    The 3rd charge relates to the accused acting for Loyang Gardens (MCST No. 2086), Peirce View (MCST No. 2085), Jade Mansion (MCST No. 0636) and Spring@Katong (MCST No. 3206), in that she had sometime after 19 May 2011, corruptly accepted gratification of S$5305 in cash from Ling as a reward for advance the business interests of TAC and its related companies with these MCSTs. This charge relates to 5 separate jobs, involving 4 MCSTs.

177    The first major piece of evidence against the accused for this charge consisted of Ling’s evidence against the accused, namely Ling’s record in P5A, and what he had stated in his statements. The latter consisted of the following accounts that implicated the accused:

> (a)     P26-3 at \[152\] and \[157\], and P26-5 at \[595\] for Loyang Garden;

> (b)     P26-3 at \[153\] and \[157\], and P26-5 at \[595\] for and Pierce View;

> (c)     P26-3 at \[154\] and \[157\], and P26-5 at \[595\] for Jade Mansion; and

> (d)     P26-3 at \[155\], \[156\] and \[157\], and P26-5 at \[595\] for Spring@Katong.

178    Further, based on P31 to P38:[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29)

> (a)     For Loyang Gardens (P7), the accused was already employed by Newman & Goh, and would have been in charge when the tender was called up till the time the letter of award was made on 21 October 2010 (see P7), to the time the invoice was sent on 22 March 2011, and when the invoice was paid on 19 May 2011.

> (b)     For the work at Pierce View, there was no invoice produced. The Prosecution submitted that the accused was in charge of Peirce View from sometime before a date in March 2011 (P31) until sometime before 22 September 2011 (at least until 10 May 2011 (P32 page 1). As such, she would likely have been involved in the quotes for this job, since Ling was paid for this job on 19 May 2011.

> (c)     For Jade Mansion (P8), the accused would be the Newman & Goh agent representing the MCST when the quotation was called on 9 December 2010, and when the invoice was sent on 23 March 2011, although it was not clear whether she was in charge when the invoice was paid on 19 May 2011.

> (d)     For Spring@Katong (P9), the accused would be the Newman & Goh agent representing the MCST when calling the quotation on 3 January 2011. She was apparently also involved on the invoice date on 18 January 2011, and the invoice payment on 19 May 2011.

> (e)     For at Spring@Katong (P10), the accused would be the Newman & Goh agent representing the MCST when calling the quotation on 28 February 2011, and on the invoice date on 13 April 2011. She was apparently also in charge on the invoice payment on 19 May 2011.

#### Loyang Gardens (Invoice P7)

179    Specifically, as regards Loyang Gardens,

> (a)     After looking at the invoice, the accused admitted in her statement P27 at \[12\] that a tender was called for this job at Loyang Gardens, _and that she was the one who had called for the quotes_. Kansai Paint had invited TAC to join them for this tender and the job was eventually awarded to Kansai Paint, although the contract between Loyang Gardens was signed with TAC. The accused was even able to remember that TAC had suggested payments via instalments for this job.

> (b)     However, the Defence argued that the invoice P7 was a contract between Kansai Paint and TAC, and that the accused and Newman & Goh were not involved. The accused thus had no role in TAC obtaining a contract with Kansai Paint. Further, what the accused had said at \[12\] of her statement P27 was erroneous as the contract was signed between the MCST and Kansai Paint, and the MCST did not award a contract to TAC. This position was also consistent with Dennis Cheng’s evidence, and the clarification made by Ling when he testified, that the accused should not have been paid the referral fees because she had nothing to do with TAC securing the job with Kansai Paint. Ling had further clarified that he had made the error in his statement in linking the accused to this referral fee as he was only shown his diary entries and he did not have sight of invoice P7 when he gave his statement.

180    Having considered the evidence, I was of the view that based on section 9(1) PCA, in light of the proven corrupt element, the accused’s guilty knowledge, and the fact that she understood the gratification that she accepted from Ling was for her recommending and referring jobs to Ling’s companies, there was no need to show that what Ling gave to the accused in relation to her principal’s affair for this job, was due to any favour that she did in fact show to him. In addition, it also did not matter that she did not even have the power to do so. I reproduce section 9(1) PCA again in its entirely:

> 9.—(1)    Where in any proceedings against any agent for any offence under section 6(a), it is proved that he corruptly accepted, obtained or agreed to accept or attempted to obtain any gratification, **_having reason to believe or suspect that the gratification was_** offered as an inducement or **_reward_** for his doing of forbearing to do any act or **_for showing_** or forbearing to show **_any favour_** or disfavour to any person in relation to his principal’s affairs or business, **_he shall be guilty of an offence under that section_** **_notwithstanding that he did not have the power, right or opportunity to do so, show_** or forbear or that he accepted the gratification without intending to do so, show or forbear **_or that he did not in fact do so_**, **_show_** or forbear or that the act, _favour_ or disfavour was not in relation to his principal’s affairs or business.

\[emphasis added\]

181    In this case, the accused was an agent of the MCST at Spring@Katong, and did in fact represent the MCST at that material time when dealing with Ling’s company for this job. Thus, the money was given to her by Ling in relation to her principal’s affairs, regardless of which parties entered into the contract finally. The crux of the accused’s involvement was in bringing in Ling’s company, TAC, in consideration for this job, which was a crucial step in his company ultimately obtaining the contract to perform the job, and benefitting and being paid in the process. It was in fact, because Ling was paid, and he recorded the receipt of that payment in P5A, that he subsequently gave the gratification to the accused.

182    Further, it was clear that the accused had corruptly accepted money from Ling, a contractor whom she was not authorised to nor was she supposed to be receiving such money from, and this was in relation to her position as an agent of the MCST, and in connection with her role in securing TAC to perform the job. She also did so with full knowledge that it was unacceptable and a conflict of interest for her to have done so, especially as she understood the sums of gratification was for her referring and recommending jobs to Ling’s companies.

183    Thus, applying the facts to the wording of s 9(1) PCA, since the accused clearly had “….reason to believe or suspect that the gratification was offered as \[a\] reward\] for her … showing any favour to \[Ling\] in relation to \[her\] principal’s affairs or business, \[she\] shall be guilty of an offence under \[s 6(a) PCA\] notwithstanding that \[she\] did not have the power, right or opportunity to… show \[any favour\]… or that \[she\] accepted the gratification without intending to … show \[any favour\]… or that \[she\] did not in fact do so, show \[any favour\]… or that the act, favour or disfavour was not in relation to his principal’s affairs or business”.

184    I would add that this analysis is in line with the decision of Choo Han Teck J in _Victorine Noella Wijeysingha_ where at \[4\] Choo J explained that in light of s 9(1) PCA “_an offence under s 6(a) does not require the actual or intended performance of the purpose of the corrupt bargain_,” and the words of Yong Pung How CJ in _Pandiyan Thanaraju Rogers_ and _Fong Ser Joo William_ that “…_it is not necessary to prove the actual act of showing favour.”_ (see \[108\] – \[114\] above).

185    Thus, by virtue of s 9(1) PCA, it did not matter that the accused **_did not actually_** show favour by advancing the business interests of Ling’s company with MCST No. 2086 (Loyang Gardens), nor that she did not have power to do so. I was satisfied that this sum of money ($3,000) corruptly accepted by her was in contravention of section 6(a) PCA.

#### Pierce View (Invoice unknown)

186    As regards Pierce View, there was a scarcity of information about this project as there was no invoice produced and the accused could not comment on it in P27. As indicated by the Prosecution, the evidence from P31 and P32 showed that the accused was involved at least from March 2011, and Ling was paid for the work on 19 May 2011. Based on P33 page 1, another employee of Newman & Goh was in charge of this estate at least on 22 September 2011.

187    However, there was no evidence that the accused was on maternity leave, or any kind of leave of absence, nor was there any reason to indicate that she would not have been in charge of this estate at the time TAC was referred and selected for this job. Instead, the evidence was that Ling had given her, instead of any other person (including the agent who was listed on P33) the gratification for this job. I was thus of the view that there was sufficient evidence to show that the accused did in fact represent the MCST for Pierce View at the time when Ling’s company was involved in the quotation and selection for this job. As the other elements of the s 6(a) PCA were made out, and in light of s 9(1) of the PCA, it does not matter whether in fact any favour was shown to Ling by the accused.

188    In short, this sum of money ($60) given to the accused as part of the gratification for the 3rd charge ($5,305), was in connection with her dealings with Ling as an agent for MCST No. 2086 for Pierce View, and hence her acceptance of the gratification was in contravention of section 6(a) PCA.

#### Jade Mansion (Invoice P8)

189    As regards Jade Mansion,

> (a)     Ling in P26-3 at \[154\] had confirmed that he had given the accused $2000 which was less than the usual 10% as referral fee. As for the accused, in her statement P27 at \[13\], while acknowledging that the invoice was “attentioned” to her, the accused said that she was unable to confirm if she had called for quotes, she admitted that she would still take part in this project because the council preferred her to be present. Her other involvement included going through the samples and past projects before TAC’s appointment, and being involved in negotiations with TAC to reduce their price.

> (b)     The Defence argued that even though the accused was the managing agent in charge of Jade Mansion at the material time, she had no role to play in the closed quotation because it was being handled by the site staff, a person known as Sidqqi, and that the evidence of Dennis Cheng was that if a site staff was present, he would be the one to monitor the progress of the work.

190    Similarly, in line with my analysis of s 9(1) PCA above, there was again no need to show that what Ling gave to the accused in connection with the project at Jade Mansion, which she accepted, was due to any favour that she did in fact show to him. Here the accused clearly did represent the MCST, and in fact had admitted that the council preferred her to be present. She was also involved in work leading up to TAC’s appointment, and negotiations thereafter, and her own evidence showed her intimate involvement in process where Ling’s company, TAC, was ultimately chosen for this job.

191    Further, while the accused accepted the entire sum without knowing explicitly what project or MCST it related to, or apparently even how the amount was arrived at or consisted of, as discussed earlier, the corrupt nature of the transaction was shown _inter alia_ from the fact that she did so with full knowledge that it was unacceptable for her to take the money, and that it was a conflict of interest for her to have done so.

192    Thus, I was of the view that this sum of money ($2,000) accepted by her as part of the gratification for the 3rd charge ($5,305), which was in connection with her dealings with Ling for this job at Jade Mansion, was in contravention of section 6(a) PCA.

#### Spring@Katong (Invoice P9)

193    Specifically, as regards the work for Spring@Katong as set out in P9:

> (a)     Ling in his statement P26-3 at \[155\] confirmed that he had given the accused $160. As for the accused, in her statement P27 at \[14\], while acknowledging that she had seen this invoice before, and that it was “attentioned” to her, the accused said that she was unable to confirm if she had called for quotes for this job.

> (b)     The Defence highlighted that the from her testimony in court, the accused was unable to recall what job was related to this invoice, because the invoice merely described the job as miscellaneous works and that, in any event, at the material time she did not know that Proseal was related with Ling.

194    Similarly, in line with my analysis of s 9(1) PCA above, there was no need to show that what Ling gave to the accused in connection with this project P9 at Spring@Katong, was due to any favour that she did in fact perform for him for this project. Based on the evidence presented from Ling, and also from Newman & Goh’s records, the money was given to the accused as she was a representative of the MCST, and this was a project that Ling was involved in.

195    As for the claim of the Defence that the accused was not aware that Proseal was related to Ling, I note that this claim was not consistent with what the accused herself had stated at \[8\] of her statement P27. There, the accused had stated that she was aware that TAC had changed names and that to her, “they are all the same company called TAC”. Further, she knew that the boss of a person called Don, who worked with Proseal, was actually Ling. Thus, to the accused “there is no difference between Proseal and TAC”. In addition, when she was specifically questioned about this invoice (P9) from Proseal that made reference to Spring@Katong, and the accused’s name also appeared on the invoice (see \[14\] of her statement P27), the accused did not say anything about not knowing that Proseal was connected with Ling. Instead, she had only said that she did not know if the money she received from Ling was for this job performed by Proseal. Even when her cautioned statement (D2) was recorded from the accused on 4 January 2019, and she was given the statutory warning that she had to state any fact relevant for her defence (as otherwise it may be less likely to be believed if it was only mentioned at her trial), the accused did not say that she was not aware that Proseal was a company associated with Ling. In light of the cogent evidence against her, I rejected the accused’s claim which she \`only mentioned at her trial’ that she did not know that Proseal was associated with Ling.

196    As for the separate claim made by the accused that she did not know what job or MCST this related to, or apparently even how the amount was arrived at or consisted of, as discussed earlier, the corrupt nature of the transaction was shown _inter alia_ from the fact that she accepted the money fully understanding that it was unacceptable, and a conflict of interest, for her to do so. She also understood that the money was given by Ling as an appreciation for inviting, recommending and referring jobs to TAC.

197    Thus, I was of the view that this sum of money ($160), corruptly accepted by the accused as part of the gratification for the 3rd charge ($5,305), was in connection with her dealing as an agent of the MCST for Spring@Katong, and her act was in contravention of section 6(a) PCA.

#### Spring@Katong (Invoice P10)

198    Specifically, as regards the work for Spring Garden set out in P10,

> (a)     Ling in P26-3 at \[156\] had confirmed that he had given the accused $85. As for the accused, in her statement P27 at \[15\], she confirmed that she had called for quotes for this job.

> (b)     The Defence highlighted that at the material time she did not know that Proseal was related with Ling.

199    I have essentially dealt with the issue concerning the accused’s awareness of Ling’s connection with Proseal, and the separate issue that it need not be shown that the accused knew the specific job or MCST that the money given to her related to, as well as the fact that there was no need to show any favour was actually performed by the accused in relation to her principal’s affairs. Based on the evidence presented from Ling, the accused’s own admissions, and also from Newman & Goh’s records, the money was given to the accused as a representative of the MCST, and this was a project that Ling and the accused were involved.

200    As with invoice P9, the corrupt nature of the transaction was shown _inter alia_, from the fact that the accused accepted the money with full knowledge that it was unacceptable to take it, and that it was a conflict of interest for her to have done so. She also understood that the money was given by Ling as an appreciation for recommending and referring jobs to TAC.

201    Thus, I was of the view that this sum of money ($85) that was corruptly accepted by her as part of the gratification from Ling for the 3rd charge ($5,305), was money given to her in relation to her principal’s affairs, and her action in accepting it was in contravention of s 6(a) PCA.

202    To sum up for the 3rd charge, I was of the view that in respect of the total sum of $5,305 given by Ling to the accused, which the accused corruptly accepted from him, this was gratification in relation to the affairs of all the MCSTs referred to in the 3rd charge. In short, the Prosecution has proven the offence in the 3rd charge beyond a reasonable doubt.

### 4th charge

203    The 4th charge relates to the accused acting for Kew Gate (MCST No. 2246) and Peirce View (MCST No. 2085), in that she had sometime after 23 June 2011 corruptly accepted gratification of S$400 in cash from Donald Ling as a reward for showing favour to TAC and its related companies to advance the business interests of TAC and its related companies with Kew Gate (MCST No. 2246) and Peirce View (MCST No. 2085).

204    The first major piece of evidence against the accused for this charge consisted of Ling’s evidence against the accused, namely Ling’s record in P5A, and his statements. The latter consisted of the following accounts that implicated the accused as having accepted the gratification:

> (a)     P26-3 at \[191\] and \[193\], and P26-5 at \[613\] for Kew Gate; and

> (b)     P26-3 at \[192\] and \[193\], and P26-5 at \[613\] for Peirce View.

205    Further, based on P31 to P38:[\[note: 30\]](#Ftn_30)

> (a)     For Kew Gate (P11), the accused was the managing agent in charge of Kew Gate when the quotation was called on 22 March 2011 and the invoice was sent on 27 April 2011.

> (b)     For the work at Pierce View (P12), the accused was the managing agent in charge of Pierce View when the quotation was called on 31 March 2011 and the invoice was sent on 25 April 2011.

#### Kew Gate (Invoice P11)

206    Specifically, as regards Kew Gate, Ling at P26-3 at \[191\] had confirmed that he had given the accused $370. As for the accused, in her statement P27 at \[16\], while acknowledging that the invoice was “attentioned” to her, she said that she did not think she had recommended TAC for this job. Further, even if she did, once the contractors came, the chairperson would talk to them himself, and her role was just to prepare documents for the chairperson and council.

207    However, the charge, as drafted, was in respect of the accused advancing the business interest of TAC and its related companies. Ling had also made it clear that the cash was given to people who had helped him in his business. In the case of the accused, she had been quite candid that the money given to her by Ling was as a token of appreciation for referring or recommending jobs to TAC. Further, as discussed above, under section 9(1) PCA, there was no need to even show that favour was actually shown to TAC and its related companies, so long as the other conditions were satisfied.

208    Accordingly, as the accused did represent the MCST for Kew Gardens when the quotation was called on 22 March 2011, I was of the view that this sum of money ($370) given to her as part of the gratification for the 4th charge ($400), was given in relation to her principal’s affairs in connection with her dealings with Ling for this invoice for Kew Garden, and that she had corruptly accepted the money in contravention of section 6(a) PCA.

#### Pierce View (Invoice P12)

209    Specifically, as regards Pierce View (P12), Ling at P26-3 at \[192\] had confirmed that he had given the accused $30. As for the accused, in her statement P27 at \[17\], she admitted that she had seen the invoice before, and that she was the one who had called for the quotes for the job. In view of the fact that the job value was $280, she believed that she only called for one quote. She added that TAC was also doing a job at Pierce View and that the Council could have asked TAC to handle this job as well. In addition, the accused stated that the Professional Engineer (PE), who was on the council, knows the pricing for such works and so the council could have decided to get TAC if the price was something that the PE felt was reasonable.

210    On the facts, even if the accused had called only one quote and this was from TAC, one of Ling’s companies, it should be noted that Newman & Goh had a list of potential contractors that a managing agent like the accused could call. Hence her action in selecting TAC alone for the quote, would have facilitated TAC in getting the job. Further, even if the final award of the work to TAC and its related companies was influenced by other factors, this did not preclude the fact that the accused would still have advanced the business interest of TAC (see discussion at \[114\] of these Grounds of Decision).

211    Further, in light of s 9(1) PCA as discussed, there was not even a need to show that favour was actually conferred on TAC and its related companies so long as the other conditions were satisfied.

212    Thus, as the accused did represent the MCST for Pierce Garden when the quotation was called on 31 March 2011 (and remained so when the invoice was sent on 25 April 2011), I was of the view that this sum of money ($30) given to her, and accepted by her, as part of the gratification for the 4th charge ($400) was a reward to her in connection with her dealings with Ling in respect of this invoice for Pierce View as set out in the charge.

213    In short, for the 4th charge as a whole, I was of the view that the Prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty of the offence under s 6(a) PCA.

### 5th charge (Invoice P13)

214    The 5th charge relates to the accused acting for Jade Mansion (MCST No. 0636), whereby it was alleged that she had sometime after 29 August 2011 corruptly accepted gratification of S$60 in cash from Ling as a reward for showing favour to TAC and its related companies to advance their business interests with MCST No. 0636.

215    The evidence against the accused for this charge consisted of Ling’s evidence against the accused, namely Ling’s record in P5A, and his statements, namely P26-3 at \[240\] and P26-5 at \[640\]. Further, based on P31 to P38[\[note: 31\]](#Ftn_31), it would appear that the accused was the managing agent in charge of Jade Mansion when the quotation was called on 13 May 2011, when the invoice was received on 24 May 2011, and when the invoice was paid on 29 May 2011.

216    In addition, as regards Jade Mansion (P13), Ling at P26-3 at \[240\] had confirmed that he had given the accused $60. As for the accused, in her statement P27 at \[18\], she had said that based on the invoice which was \`attentioned’ to her, the quote was probably called by her site staff. In court, the accused said that the site staff stationed at Jade Mansion was Sidqqi, who was her subordinate, although she also said that Sidqqi was the one who handled all the correspondence.

217    However, I note that aside from the accused’s claim made in court, there was no evidence of any involvement of a site staff by the name of Sidqqi in this job. Instead, the invoice in this case was \`attentioned’ to the accused, and the accused was involved with this estate at all material times. Further, I observed that Ling had made it clear that the gratification was given to people who had helped in his business. This would suggest that despite the accused’s claim to the contrary, it was the accused (rather than Sidqqi) who had represented the MCST when dealing with TAC and its related companies at all material times, including at the time the quote was called, as otherwise it would have been Sidqqi who would have been offered the gratification.

218    Further, in line with my analysis of s 9(1) PCA above, there was no need to show that what Ling gave to the accused in connection with this job at Jade Mansion (P13), was due to any favour that she did in fact perform for him.

219    Accordingly, as regards this 5th charge, I was of the view that the accused’s acceptance of the gratification from Ling, while representing the MCST, was corrupt and was in contravention of s 6(a) PCA.

### 6th charge (Invoice P14)

220    The 6th charge relates to the accused acting for Lip Hing Industrial Building (MCST No. 1188), whereby it was alleged that she had sometime after 5 January 2012, corruptly accepted gratification of S$90 in cash from Donald Ling as a reward for showing favour to TAC and its related companies in relation to her principal’s affairs to advance their business interests with Lip Hing Industrial Building (MCST No. 1188).

221    The evidence against the accused for this charge consisted of Ling’s evidence against the accused, namely Ling’s record in P5B, and his statements, namely P26-4 at \[284\] and P26-5 at \[669\]. Further, based on P31 to P38, the accused was the managing agent in charge of Lip Hing Industrial Building, on the quotation date of 26 September 2011, when the invoice P14 was issued to the MCST, and when the invoice was paid.[\[note: 32\]](#Ftn_32)

222    Specifically, as regards Lip Hing Industrial Building (P14), Ling at P26-3 at \[284\] had confirmed that he had given the accused $90. As for the accused, in her statement P27 at \[19\], she confirmed that she was the one who had called for quotes for the job, and that she had called TAC for this purpose.

223    In court, the accused claimed that she had have been mistaken and mixed this work up with another work, and that she realised her mistake after the interview with the CPIB when she went home and checked her documents.

224    However, I was of the view that if the accused had really realised this “error” as she had claimed, and if she really became aware of her “error” after the recording of the statement P27, there was no reason for her not to have mentioned this error in her subsequent cautioned statement D2 , or in her Case for the Defence. This was especially so since both of these were documents where it was clearly important, and also emphasised to her and her Defence team, that she has to set out her defence. Such a glaring omission on her part, made it hard to believe her claim on this point which she made only belated at her trial.

225    All in all, having considered the evidence, I was satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to establish that the accused had corruptly accepting the $90 as alleged in the 6th charge, and that this was in contravention of s6(a) PCA.

### 7th charge (Invoice P15)

226    The 7th charge relates to the accused acting for Peirce View (MCST No. 2085), whereby it was alleged that she had sometime after 12 January 2012, corruptly accepted gratification of S$578 in cash from Donald Ling as a reward for showing favour to TAC and its related companies in relation to her principal’s affairs to advance their business interests with MCST No. 2085.

227    The evidence against the accused for this charge consisted of Ling’s evidence against the accused, namely Ling’s record in P5B, and his statement, namely P26-4 at \[285\] and P26-5 at \[670\]. Based on P31, the accused was the managing agent in charge of Pierce View sometime before March 2011, although it was not clear when she took over.

228    Further, from the invoice P15, the letter of award for this work was made on 26 August 2010, which would have been after the accused had joined Newman & Goh. However, since the accused only joined Newman and Goh on 6 August 2010, it was not clear:

> (a)     when the quotes for the job were called as we only know that the letter of award on 26 August 2010. The evidence of the accused was that the tender was likely to have been called a couple of months before August 2010, and that contractors had already been shortlisted by the time the accused attended the first council meeting on 11 August 2010;[\[note: 33\]](#Ftn_33)

> (b)     whether the accused was even involved in calling for the quotes; or

> (c)     whether the accused was even in charge of the estate at the time the quotes were called (which would be before 26 August 2010).

229    In any event, the accused’s evidence was that the calling of the tender for this job preceded her employment with Newman & Goh, and her evidence was consistent with that of Dennis Cheng. [\[note: 34\]](#Ftn_34) While not strictly relevant, I also noted that the accused was not in charge when the invoice was sent on 23 November 2011, or when the invoice was paid on 12 January 2012.[^35]

230    All in all, there was clear doubt that the accused even represented the MCST _at the time the quote was called, or that she was involved in calling for the quote_, and/or in the decision to award the job to TAC.

231    Thus, as with the 1st charge, _without clear proof that she even represented the MCST at the crucial time of the quote, when TAC or its related companies could have been referred or recommended for the job_, an essential element of the charge was not made out. For completeness, s 9(1) of the PCA would also not operate to ‘save’ the charge in such circumstances (see discussion at \[111\]). I was thus of the view that the 7th charge under s 6(a) PCA was not made out.

### 8th charge

232    The 8th charge relates to the accused acting for Ching Shine Industrial Building (MCST No. 0725) and Peirce View (MCST No. 2085), whereby it was alleged that sometime after 6 March 2012, she corruptly accepted gratification of S$1114 in cash from Donald Ling as a reward for showing favour to TAC and its related companies in relation to her principal’s affairs to advance their business interests with Ching Shine Industrial Building (MCST No. 0725) and Peirce View (MCST No. 2085).

233    The first major piece of evidence against the accused for this charge consisted of Ling’s evidence against the accused, namely Ling’s record in P5B, and his statements. The latter consisted of the following accounts that implicated the accused:

> (a)     P26-4 at \[312\] and P26-6 at \[680\] for Ching Shine Industrial Building; and

> (b)     P26-4 at \[313\] and P26-6 at \[680\] for Pierce View.

234    Further, based on P31 to P38: [\[note: 36\]](#Ftn_36)

> (a)     For Ching Shine Industrial Building (P16), the accused would have been the managing agent when the quotations were called on or about 19 October 2011, as well as when the invoice was sent on or about 13 December 2011. When the invoice was paid on 6 March 2012, the accused was on maternity leave.

> (b)     For Pierce View (P17), _there was no evidence that the accused was in charge of Pierce View when the quotations were called on 8 November 2011_. Nor was there evidence that she was in charge when the invoice was sent on 13 December 2011, or even when the invoice was processed and paid on 6 March 2012. Furthermore she was on maternity leave by the payment date.

#### Ching Shine Industrial Building (Invoice P16)

235    Specifically, as regards Ching Shine Industrial Building,

> (a)     Ling at P26-4 at \[312\] had confirmed that he had given the accused $748.

> (b)     As for the accused, in her statement P27 at \[21\], she said that she was unable to confirm if she or her colleague, Brian Ling, had called for this job, but she was only in charge of Ching Shine Industrial Building for a few months. However, in court she insisted that it was Brian who had done this, and she only handled the administrative matters.

236    In this particular case, Ling had made it clear that the gratification was given to people who had helped in their business, and that he only knew the accused as the representative for this estate. I accepted the evidence in his statement that he had indeed given the money to her, and rejected her unsubstantiated claim that she had only handled the administrative matters. If indeed, she was only involved in the latter, Ling would not have stated what he did in his statement, a version of affairs that was given much closer to the event.

237    Further, if indeed it was Brian whom Ling had dealt with in respect of this job, I fail to see why Ling would have given the money to the accused instead. As for the accused’s denials in court, since she claimed that she could not remember if she had called for the job when she gave her statement P27 on 27 March 2015, I could hardly believe that her memory would suddenly become so much better in 2021, and she could suddenly recall that it was actually Brian who had called for the job.

238    Having rejected the belated attempt by the accused to dissociate herself from this job, I would add that in line with section 9(1) PCA, as the other conditions were satisfied, there was no need to even show that any favour was actually conferred on TAC and its related companies in respect of this job. Accordingly, her acceptance of the gratification from Ling, while representing Ching Shine Industrial Building was corrupt, and this was also in contravention of section 6(a) PCA.

#### Pierce View (Invoice P17)

239    As regards Pierce View (P17), Ling at P26-4 at \[313\] had confirmed that he gave the accused $366. As for the accused, in her statement P27 at \[22\], she acknowledged that the invoice was directed to her and that she had seen it before, although she was unable to say that she was the one who had called for the quotes for the job, because the description was only for “Miscellaneous Works. After referencing P32 to P38, the accused says that she was not in charge of Peirce View at the material time for this work, and hence she would not have any role to play relating to P17.

240    In respect of this job, unlike that for Ching Shine Industrial Building which she confirmed she had dealt with, there was insufficient evidence that the accused was representing the MCST at the point of getting the quote for the job (see in particular \[234(b)\] of these Grounds of Decision). It could thus not be said that she was an agent for the MCST or that the gratification was given to her in relation to her principal’s affair in respect of this estate and for this job. As such, I was of the view that this aspect of the 8th charge under s 6(a) PCA was not made out, and neither did s 9(1) PCA operate to save it.

241    As with my analysis for the 2nd charge (see \[167\] – \[173\] above), as the Prosecution was only able to prove its case with respect to one job and in relation to one MCST (MCST Nos. 0725 for Ching Shine Industrial Building), I was of the view that I could, and should, exercise my discretion under s 128(1) of the CPC to amend the charge. This was especially so as it could also be clearly identified what amount of gratification was given (and accepted) in connection with this “proven” component of the charge (i.e. the sum of $748 in relation to the job for MCST Nos. 0725). As discussed earlier, in such a situation, the court should amend the charge to reflect the offence that has been proven. Accordingly, I amended the 8th charge by striking out reference to MCST 2085 (for Pierce View), and making the relevant amendment to the sum accepted relating to the remaining MCST:

> You…are charged that you, being an agent, to wit, a Senior Property Executive acting for Management Corporation Strata Title (“MCST”) Nos. 0725 ~and 2085~, ~on or about~ sometime after 6 March 2012, in Singapore, corruptly accept gratification of S$~1,114~ $748 in cash from one Ling Chun Teck Donald, a Director of TAC Contracts Pte Ltd, as a reward for showing favour to TAC Contracts Pte Ltd and its related companies in relation to your principals’ affairs, to wit, to advance the business interests of TAC Contracts Pte Ltd and its related companies with MCST Nos. 0725 ~and 2085~, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

242    Having re-amended the 8th charge in the manner set out above, and having reviewed all the evidence adduced in relation to the re-amended 8th charge, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case on the re-amended 8th charge beyond a reasonable doubt, and I convicted her accordingly.

### 9th charge

243    The 9th charge relates to the accused acting for Jasmine Court (MCST No. 1102) and Spring@Katong (MCST No. 3206), in that she had sometime after 27 April 2012, corruptly accepted gratification of S$700 in cash from Donald Ling as a reward for showing favour to TAC and its related companies in relation to her principal’s affairs to advance the business interests of TAC and its related companies with Jasmine Court (MCST No. 1102) and Spring@Katong (MCST No. 3206).

244    The first major piece of evidence against the accused for this charge consisted of Ling’s evidence, namely Ling’s record in P5B, and his statements. The latter consisted of the following accounts that implicated the accused:

> (a)     P26-4 at \[141\] (wrongly numbered) and P26-6 at \[689\] for Jasmine Court; and

> (b)     P26-4 at \[327\] and P26-6 at \[689\] for Spring@Katong.

245    Further, based on P31 to P38: [\[note: 37\]](#Ftn_37)

> (a)     For Jasmine Court (P18), the accused would have been in charge of Jasmine Court at the time of the calling of the quotation on 11 January 2012, although on the invoice date of 6 February 2012, and when the invoice was paid on 27 April 2012, she was on maternity leave.

> (b)     For Spring@Katong (P19), it was not clear if the accused was in charge when the quotations were called on 1 November 2011, or when the invoice was sent on 15 November 2011, as there was an involvement of another agent as of 27 October 2011 (P34 page 1). She was on maternity leave when the invoice was paid on 27 April 2012.

#### Jasmine court (Invoice P18)

246    Specifically, as regards Jasmine Court (P18), Ling at P26-4 at \[141\] (wrongly numbered) and P26-6 at \[689\] had confirmed that he had given the accused $500 in cash. The accused had also admitted in her statement P27 at \[23\] that that she was the one who had called for quotes for this job set out in the invoice P18, and that the invoice was \`attentioned’ to her. She was even able to give details of the job, including stating that it was a “urgent case”.

247    In court, the accused said that she could not remember if she was in charge of Jasmine Court when the quotation was called, and said that she thinks that the quotation may have been called after she handed over to her colleague “Lyn Wang”. She testified that she does not recall being involved in the job set out in P18. However, when questioned further, the accused explained that even though they were in the transition period and she was handing over to her colleague, the MCST would still call her out of habit, as she still regarded as part of Newman & Goh and because the accused had been overseeing the _enbloc_ process from the start.

248    In respect of this job, I accepted the account of Ling and the accused in their statements that the accused was given the gratification of $200, and that this was in relation to the work she was performing for the MCST when liaising with Ling. I also accepted that it was the accused who had called for the quote, as she could provide details of it in P27. Further, the accused ’s contrary version in court that it was actually her colleague Lyn Wang who had done so, was something she had only belatedly mentioned during her trial. In any event, even by her own account, the MCST continued to look to her and call her, even after she had allegedly handed over. This showed the obvious influence she had in the decision making process of the MCST. In such circumstances, it was not surprising that Ling regarded her as the representative for Jasmine Court, and that he had rewarded her for advancing the business interest of his companies in line with this. By virtue of s9(1) PCA, neither was it necessary to show that she did in fact favour TAC and its related companies, as the other elements of the corruption offence were made out.

#### Spring@Katong (Invoice P19)

249    Specifically, as regards Spring@Katong (P19), Ling in his statements P26-4 at \[327\] and P26-6 at \[689\] had confirmed that he had given the accused $500 in cash. As for the accused, in her statement P27 at \[24\], she acknowledged that the invoice was \`attentioned’ to her but claimed that she was unable to say if she had called for the quotes for the job because the description was only “Miscellaneous Works. The accused also said that TAC had helped out by providing complimentary service at this estate, and that was probably why TAC was invited and awarded the jobs.

250    Subsequently, after referencing P32 to P38, the accused says that she was not in charge of Spring@Katong at the material time for this work, and that it was Ronald Chan who was in charge of the estate during that period. Hence, he would have been the one who called for the quotations. Dennis Cheng also agreed that the quotation would have been called for by Ronald Chan.

251    In respect of this job, as set out above (see in particular \[245(b)\] and \[249\] of these Grounds of Decision), there was insufficient evidence that the accused was representing the MCST when dealing with Ling at the point of getting the quotation for the job. It could thus not be said, beyond a reasonable doubt, that she was an agent for the MCST at the relevant time, or that the gratification was given to her in relation to her principal’s affair in respect of this estate and for this job. As such, I was thus of the view that the aspect of the 9th charge under s 6(a) PCA was not made out.

252    As with my analysis for the 2nd charge (see \[167\] – \[173\] above), I was of the view that I could, and should exercise my discretion under s 128(1) of the CPC to amend the charge, since it has been established by the Prosecution that the s 6(a) PCA charge has been made out in relation to one of the MCSTs named in the charge, i.e. MCST Nos. 1102 for Jasmine Court. Further, it could also be clearly identified what amount of gratification was given (and accepted) in connection with this “proven” component and MCST (in this case $200 in relation to MCST Nos. 1102).

253    In such circumstances, the court could, and indeed, should amend the charge to reflect the offence that has been proven. Accordingly, I amended the 9th charge by striking out reference to MCST 3206 (for Spring@Katong), and making the relevant amendment to the sum accepted for the remaining MCST:

> You…are charged that you, being an agent, to wit, a Senior Property Executive acting for Management Corporation Strata Title (“MCST”) Nos. 1102 ~and 3206~, did ~on or about~ sometime after 27 April 2012, in Singapore, corruptly accept gratification of ~S$700~ S$200 in cash from one Ling Chun Teck Donald, a Director of TAC Contracts Pte Ltd, as a reward for showing favour to TAC Contracts Pte Ltd and its related companies in relation to your principals’ affairs, to wit, to advance the business interests of TAC Contracts Pte Ltd and its related companies with MCST Nos. 1102 ~and 3206~, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

254    Having re-amended the 9th charge in the manner set out above, and having reviewed all the evidence adduced in relation to the re-amended 9th charge, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case on the re-amended 9th charge beyond a reasonable doubt, and I convicted her accordingly

### 10th charge

255    The 10th charge relates to the accused acting for Treasure Place (MCST No. 3145), in that it was alleged that she had on or about 21 June 2012 corruptly accepted gratification of S$388 in cash from Donald Ling as a reward for showing favour to TAC and its related companies in relation to her principal’s affairs to advance the business interests of TAC and its related companies with Treasure Place (MCST No. 3145).

256    The first major piece of evidence against the accused for this charge consisted of Ling’s evidence against the accused, namely Ling’s record in P5B, and his statements. The latter consisted of the following accounts that implicated the accused:

> (a)     P26-4 at \[355\] and P26-6 at \[699\] for Treasure Place (invoice P20);

> (b)     P26-4 at \[365\] and P26-6 at \[699\] for Treasure Place (invoice P21); and

> (c)     P26-4 at \[357\] and P26-6 at \[699\] for Treasure Place (invoice P22).

257    Further, based on P31 to P38: [\[note: 38\]](#Ftn_38)

> (a)     In respect of invoice P20, the accused was managing Treasure Place when the quotation was called on 24 February 2012, and when the invoice was received on 7 March 2012.

> (b)     In respect of invoice P21, the accused was managing Treasure Place when the quotation was called on 24 February 2012, and when the invoice was received on 7 March 2012.

> (c)     In respect of invoice P21, it was not clear if she was the managing agent when the quotation was called. Instead, it appears that Ronald Chan was the managing agent in charge of the estate until he went missing around February or March 2012. The accused was not in charge of Treasure Place when the invoice was received on 3 February 2012 because she was on maternity leave.

#### Treasure Place (Invoice P20)

258    Specifically, as regards Treasure Place (P20), Ling at P26-4 at \[355\] had stated that he had given the accused $150 in cash.

259    The accused had stated in her statement P27 at \[25\] that that she does not think that she was the one who called the quotation for this job, as the date of the quotation was in February 2012 when she was on maternity leave. The accused said that she only came back in March to take over the site because Ronald, her ex-colleague had “gone MIA”. She only followed up on the invoice to settle payment and was not involved in inviting TAC for this job. The accused maintained the same position in court, namely that the date of quotation and date of invoice both fell during her maternity leave which lasted from 1 February 2012 to 12 May 2012.

260    Further, Dennis Cheng agreed that the accused was on maternity leave when the quotation was called on 24 February 2012, and the works that were carried out between the quotation date and the invoice date (7 March 2012) were all done when the accused was on maternity leave. Hence, she could not have had a role to play for this job.

261    The Defence argued that since the accused was on maternity leave from 1 February 2012 to 12 May 2012, and that while the accused was the managing agent for Treasure Place on paper since March 2012 (due to the original managing agent Ronald being missing in action), in reality, it was the accused’s mentor who had overseen the estate for the period that the accused was on maternity leave.

262    In respect of this job, while the documentary evidence P31, P34 and P35 suggested that the accused was the managing agent in charge, there was evidence from the accused and Dennis Cheng that the accused was actually on maternity leave from 1 February 2012 until 12 May 2012. Thus, as the evidence was that the quotation was called around 24 February 2012, there was a reasonable doubt that the accused was involved in the quotation for the job, and that she was representing the MCST when dealing with Ling at the point of getting the quote for the job. It was thus unclear if she was an agent for the MCST, and that the gratification was given to her in relation to her principal’s affair in respect to this job. As such, I was of the view that the benefit of the doubt should be given to the accused, and my assessment was thus that this aspect of the 10th charge under s 6(a) PCA was not made out.

#### Treasure Place (Invoice P21)

263    Specifically, as regards Treasure Place (P21), Ling in P26-4 at \[356\] had confirmed that he had given the accused $150 in cash.

264    As with invoice P20, the accused had stated in her statement P27 at \[26\] that for invoice P21, she does not think that she was the one who had called for the quotation for this job, as the date of the quotation was in February 2012 when she was on maternity leave. Thus, similar to her earlier explanation, she only came back in March to take over the site because Ronald, her ex-colleague had “gone MIA”. The accused said that she had only followed up on the invoice to settle payment and was not involved in inviting TAC for this job. She maintained the same position in court, that the date of quotation and date of invoice both fell within her maternity leave period which ran from 1 February 2012 to 12 May 2012, and that hence she was not involved in this project other than in the processing of the payment. Also, as stated earlier, Dennis Cheng agreed that the job was carried out when the accused was on maternity leave, and hence she would not have had a role to play.

265    In short, for this job set out in invoice P21, as with the job set out in invoice P20, there was insufficient evidence that the accused was representing the MCST No. 3145when dealing with Ling at the point of getting the quote for the job, since she may have been on maternity leave at the material time. It could thus not be said that she was an agent for the MCST or that the gratification was given to her in relation to her principal’s affair in respect of this job. As such, I was of the view that the benefit of the doubt should be given to the accused, and my assessment was thus that this aspect of the 10th charge under s 6(a) PCA was not made out.

#### Treasure Place (Invoice P22)

266    Specifically, as regards Treasure Place (P22), Ling in P26-4 at \[357\] had confirmed that he had given the accused $88 in cash.

267    For invoice P22, which was \`attentioned’ to Emily Lee, the accused had stated in her statement P27 at \[27\] that she was unsure if she was the one who had called the quotation for this job, as she was about to go on her maternity leave then. While the accused said that she had followed up on the invoice to settle payment, she said that Emily could have called TAC to handle this work, as they were also handling other work at Treasure Place.

268    In court, the accused insisted that she did not have any involvement in the contract, and that the quotation took place before she took over the project, and also that the invoice was issued during her maternity leave period. She said that from the invoice, it was most likely Emily Lee that awarded the project. Dennis Cheng also stated that Emily Lee could have called for the quotation because the invoice was addressed to her.

269    In respect of this job, there was insufficient evidence that the accused was representing the MCST when dealing with Ling at the time of getting the quote for the job. For this invoice particularly, it was not even \`attentioned’ to the accused but to Emily Lee instead.

270    It could thus not be said that the accused was an agent for the MCST, or that the gratification was given to her as a reward in relation to her principal’s affair in respect of this estate and for this job. As such, I was thus of the view that the aspect of the 9th charge under s 6(a) PCA was not made out.

271    Thus, all in all, for the 10th charge, as regards the gratification totalling $388, I was of the view that there was insufficient evidence to prove the 10th charge beyond a reasonable doubt, and I acquitted her of the charge.

### 11th charge

272    The offence referred to in the 11th charge was one under s 5(a) of the PCA in that it was alleged that the accused had corruptly received gratification of S$607 in cash from Donald Ling as a reward for advancing the business interests of TAC and its related companies with Loyang Gardens (MCST No. 2086), Casa Jervois (MCST No. 1645), and Jasmine Court (MCST No. 1102).

#### Proof of actus reus

273    Unlike the 1st to 10th charges, there was no dispute that the accused was no longer in the employ of Newman & Goh at the time of the alleged receipt of the gratification. This was because the alleged receipt occurred on a date after 27 November 2012, which was when the accused was no longer in the employ of Newman & Goh. In this regard, the accused’s last day of employment was more than two months before 27 November 2012 i.e. on 7 September 2012, and her evidence was that after that date, she also did not meet Ling, or any of the contractors nor did she have any dealings with the MCSTs. She also had nothing to do with Newman & Goh or any of the estates named in the charge i.e. Loyang Gardens, Casa Jervois, or Jasmine Court.[\[note: 39\]](#Ftn_39)

274    The Prosecution took the position that in light of the evidence of Ling and the accused (in particular \[9\] of her statement P27) the gratification from Ling, including the sum set out in the 11th charge, was given to the accused near to her house in Serangoon. This meant that Ling could have given her the gratification even after 27 November 2012 when she was no longer in the employment of Newman & Goh, and no longer went to the sites.[\[note: 40\]](#Ftn_40)

275    However, there was no evidence from Ling that he had met the accused other than at the sites. Indeed, there was really no reason for him to have done so. Nor was there any reason for the accused to have deliberately gone to the sites on or after 27 November 2012, when she had left the employ of Newman & Goh months before that. Indeed, consistent with Ling’s statement in P26-7 at \[759\] that so long as the accused was in charge of the site, he would have given her the “referral fees”, it would appear that by 27 November 2012, the accused was clearly NOT in charge of any of the sites anymore and hence he would not likely have gone out of his way, to meet her near her home, to give her the “referral fees”. This was unlike the situation with the 1st – 10th charges, where the _actus reus_ could have taken place, as the acceptance of the gratification occurred when the accused was still in the employ of Newman & Goh, and hence, Ling would have both the reason, and opportunity, to give her the ‘referral fees’.

276    In addition, as regards the 11th charge, it does not appear that the accused was explicitly challenged on her evidence that she had not met with Ling after 27 November 2012, nor was this put to the accused.[\[note: 41\]](#Ftn_41) It also does not appear, that it was explicitly put across to the accused that the gratification in the 11th charge was received by her even when she no longer went to the various estates.

277    Thus, as the accused had left the employment of Newman & Goh since 7 September 2012, and by her evidence, she had nothing more to do with Newman & Goh, the contractors, or the MCSTs/estates thereafter, this made it more challenging for the Prosecution to prove that Ling had reasons to, and did indeed, make a special effort to, meet up with the accused (apparently near to her house) to give her the money, on an occasion quite sometime after she had resigned her employment at Newman & Goh.

278    While it was not entirely clear when Ling actually found out that she had left the employ of Newman & Goh, I was of the view that unlike the case of the other 10 charges, where there was clearly sufficient evidence to make out at least the _actus reus_ of the offences, especially since the gratification apparently took place when the accused was undisputedly still an employee of Newman & Goh, this was certainly not the case with the 11th charge. Instead, for the reasons set out above, there was some uncertainty concerning the proof of the _actus reus_ of the offence for the 11th charge, i.e. whether in fact Ling had given the money to the accused sometime after 27 November 2012.

279    This would have created a reasonable doubt as to whether the 11th charge was made out, and it would have been sufficient for me to acquit her on this basis. Nevertheless, for completeness, I would also look at other aspects of the 11th charge, to assess whether the other ingredients were made out.

280    In this regard, I was fully cognisant that this charge was one under s 5 (a)(i) of the PCA, rather than one under s 6(a) of the PCA. The latter would have required the Prosecution to have proven that the reward was for any act, favour or disfavour to any person in relation to the recipient's principal's affairs or business, while a charge under s 5(a)(i) was broader in that there was no necessity to prove any reference or connection with his principal’s affairs.

281    That said, there was still a need to prove the corrupt element, and guilty knowledge to establish a s 5 PCA charge (see \[44\] of these Grounds of Decision). Thus, as both of these _mens rea_ elements for the s 5(a)(i) charge were invariably tied to the conflict of interest that arose from the accused’s receipt of gratification from the contractor that was performing the jobs for the MCSTs that the accused was representing, and as the accused was also, according to Newman & Goh’s rules, not supposed to be receiving monies from contractors who were performing such jobs of the MCSTs, it was still important to establish the link between the accused and the particular MCST for the s 5(a)(i) charge. Thus, I still had to consider the link between the accused and the respective MCSTs at the point that Ling’s companies were to be referred and/or recommended for these jobs.

282    Indeed, even for the s 5(a)(i) charge, it was clear from the arguments of both the Prosecution and the Defence that they did not see any significant difference between the nature of evidence needed to prove the 11th charge (under s 5(a)(i) PCA) and the 1st to 10th charge (under s 6(a) PCA). Accordingly, for the 11th charge, I analysed the evidence regarding proof of the _mens rea_ elements for this charge, in a similar manner as to my analysis of the evidence concerning proof of the _mens rea_ elements for the 1st to 10th charges.

283    In this regard, the Prosecution’s evidence consisted of Ling’s record in P5B, and the following accounts in his statements that implicated the accused:

> (a)     P26-4 at \[393\] and \[397\], and P26-6 at \[719\] for Loyang Garden;

> (b)     P26-4 at \[394\] and \[397\], and P26-6 at \[719\] for Casa Jervois (invoice P24);

> (c)     P26-4 at \[395\] and \[397\], and P26-6 at \[719\] for Casa Jervois (no invoice); and

> (d)     P26-4 at \[396\] and \[397\], and P26-6 at \[719\] for Jasmine Court;

284    Further, based on P31 to P38: [\[note: 42\]](#Ftn_42)

> (a)     For Loyang Gardens (P23), the accused was the managing agent at the time of the quotation on 14 May 2012 and as at the invoice date on 17 May 2012.

> (b)     For Casa Jervois (P24), the accused was the managing agent when the quotation was made on 10 July 2012, and the invoice date on 10 July 2012.

> (c)     For Casa Jervois (no invoice), there was a lack of information about this job, as there was no invoice, invoice date or quotation date and no job description available. The invoice payment date was 27 November 2012.

> (d)     For Jasmine Court (P25), the accused was the managing agent when the quotation was called on 13 August 2012.

#### Loyang Gardens (Invoice P23)

285    As regards Loyang Gardens (P23 – invoice \`attentioned’ to the accused), Ling had, in his statement P26-4 at \[393\] confirmed that he had given the accused $27 in cash. In court, Ling said that he would not have given the accused referral fees on or after 27 November 2012 because at that time she was no longer working with Newman & Goh, and it was not his practice to give referral fees to managing agents who had already left their company.

286    As for the accused, she had stated in her statement P27 at \[28\] that that she was the one who called for quotes for this job, which was an urgent job, and that TAC quoted $270, while other contractors quoted around $500 - $800. TAC was able to quote lower probably because they were already doing another waterproofing job at Loyang Garden. The accused said that she had checked with a resident in Loyang Garden who was also a contractor, and he had agreed that the price quoted by TAC was reasonable. She added that the Council would have taken his advice. The accused testified said that she does not remember receiving any money related to this job.

287    In so far as showing favour to Ling was concerned, I have already discussed this issue above. To summarise, the accused had made a general admission that she believed that money was given to her by Ling for referring and recommending jobs to TAC. She was aware that she was not supposed to take money from him due to a conflict of interest this could create. It was also clear that TAC was one contractor from a list of contractors that she could have chosen from when referring jobs or asking for quotes. In addition, the accused had, aside from asking TAC for quotes, also on occasions called TAC to provide ‘additional quotes’ purportedly from other contractors. In addition, the accused was in a position to recommend to the MCST the choice of the contractor to perform the job, even though she was not in the actual position to award the job.

288    As s 5(a)(i) is worded more broadly than s 6(a), there does not appear to be any need to show that the accused was acting in relation to her principal’s affairs at the time of the quote. Thus, while s 9(1) PCA does not operate for a charge drafted under s 5(a)(i) PCA, for the reasons set out in \[115\]-\[118\] above, I was of the view that there was no need to show that the accused actually did advance the business interest of Ling’s company. in short, the other elements of s 5(a)(i) PCA would have been made out for this aspect of the charge, had the actus reus been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

#### Casa Jervois ((Invoice P24)

289    Specifically, as regards Casa Jervois (P24 – invoice \`attentioned’ to the accused), Ling in his statement P26-4 at \[394\] had confirmed that he had given the accused $50 in cash. In court, Ling said that he would not have given the accused referral fees on or after 27 November 2012 because at that time she was no longer working with Newman & Goh, and it was not his practice to give referral fees to managing agents who had already left their company.

290    The accused had stated in her statement P27 at \[29\] that that she was the one who had called for quotes for this job. Since TAC had charged a nominal fee for it, and they had helped in assessing the problem, the Council had agreed to award the job of repairing the roof vent pipes to TAC. In court, the accused disagreed that she had called for the quotes for this job, and said that the rectification works were done on a goodwill basis and no quotation was called.

291    The accused also said that the MCST had requested TAC to propose a nominal amount for the job, and TAC had then quoted $500 which the council agreed. Thereafter TAC submitted the quotation and the invoice for the job.

292    Dennis Cheng of Newman & Goh was of the view that the job would be considered an urgent job, and it would be fair to call the contractors in the List of Accredited Contractors to quickly resolve the issue.

293    Similar to the job involving Loyang Gardens, I was of the view that the elements of the s 5(a)(i) PCA would have been made out for this aspect of the charge, had the _actus reus_ been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

#### Casa Jervois (No invoice)

294    Specifically, as regards this job at Casa Jervois (with no corresponding invoice), Ling in P26-4 at \[395\] had confirmed that he had given the accused $200 in cash. In court, Ling said that he would not have given referral fees to managing agents who had already left the employ of their company, and thus would not have passed her this sum of $200.

295    As for the accused, there was no discussion of this job in her statement P27. In court, the accused said that she does not know what this job was as there is no invoice or quotation as a point of reference. In light of the dearth of evidence, there was insufficient basis to decide if the _mens rea_ element has been satisfied. This was on top of the doubt I had expressed about the _actus reus_ having been sufficiently proven.

#### Jasmine court ((Invoice P25)

296    Specifically, as regards Jasmine Court (P25 – invoice \`attentioned’ to the accused), Ling in P26-4 at \[396\] confirmed that he had given the accused $330 in cash. In court, Ling said that he would not have given the accused the referral fees on or after 27 November 2012 because at that time she was no longer working with Newman & Goh, and it was not his practice to give referral fees to managing agents who had already left the employ of their company.

297    The accused stated in her statement P27 at \[30\] that that she was the one who had called for quotes for this job, although it was likely that subsequently the rest of the job was handled by her colleague who took over from her in light of her notice period of one month. She said that she had tendered her resignation on 8 August 2012, and as such, she would have been handing over her projects. By the 3rd week from the date that she tendered her resignation, she would no longer be handling the jobs. The accused further said that a few contractors were called to quote for the job, and that it was because of proactive action from TAC that caused the council to decide to award the job to TAC, which submitted the most competitive quotation.

298    Dennis Cheng informed that where a staff member was resigning, it was the company’s policy that the replacement staff would tag along with the outgoing staff member who was managing the estate, and that both of them would be responsible for the job. Based on invoices P25 and P38, it was possible that the accused was no longer in charge of Jasmine Court during the period of August 2012 to September 2012, and that it was Peter Lim who was in charge of the estate.

299    In light of the fact that the calling of the quote, and the accused’s resignation took place about the same time, and in light of the practice of Newman & Goh vis-à-vis employees who had tendered their resignations, the extent of involvement of the accused in this job was not clear. Coupled with the uncertainly over the _actus reus_ of the offence, I was of the view that there was insufficient evidence to prove this component of the charge.

300    In short, for the 11th charge which comprised of 4 separate jobs, involving three estates, there was insufficient evidence to prove all the elements of this charge beyond a reasonable doubt. I thus acquitted the accused accordingly.

## Summary of the charges that were made out

301    I summarise below the charges which I was of the view had been established beyond a reasonable doubt, based on the available evidence.

302    In short, where there was a reasonable doubt for any of the proceeded charges, the accused was given the benefit of the doubt, and she was acquitted of the charge, or the charge was amended essentially to a lesser charge, based on available evidence that supported the lesser charge. The latter was done by striking out the details of the MCST(s) that was not proven, and a corresponding amendment was made to the total gratification accepted by the accused.

303    I am of the view that the remaining seven charges (as amended in some cases) have been proven against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt, and I convicted her accordingly.

## Sentencing Considerations

304    I now deal with sentencing for the seven charges that I have convicted the accused of.

### Prescribed punishment and antecedents

305    The prescribed punishment for an offence of corruptly accepting any gratification as a reward for doing an act in relation to his principal’s affairs under section 6(a) PCA is a fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both_._

306    The accused is a first offender.

### Prosecution‘s submissions on sentence

307    The prosecutor, Ms. Magdalene Huang (“DPP Huang”) tendered a written submission on sentence, where she sought a global custodial sentence of **at least 10 weeks**, **as well as a penalty of S$7,183 under s13 of the PCA**.

308    DPP Huang’s arguments for her position are essentially as follows:

> (a)     Deterrence is always a relevant sentencing consideration for corruption cases, and the preservation of a corruption-free environment has always been a cornerstone of governance in Singapore (citing _PP v Ang Seng Thor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 217</span> (“**_Ang Seng Thor_**”) at \[33\]).

> (b)     The custodial threshold has been crossed in view of the numerous aggravating facts in the accused’s case. In this regard, the Prosecution highlighted that in _PP v Syed Mostofa Romel_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 1166</span> (“**_Romel_**”) at \[23\] it was held that “(w)here private sector corruption involves gratification which is received over a lengthy period of time, or a compromise of one’s duty or a serious betrayal of trust, the starting point is likely to be a custodial sentence”

> (c)     In line with _Romel_, DPP Huang further argued that there was:

>> (i)       Sustained and persistent offending by the accused who corruptly accepted gratification on 7 occasions between sometime after 18 March 2011 and sometime after 27 April 2012; and

>> (ii)       The accused had also compromised her duty to her principals as it was found that she had asked for and received support quotations from Ling’s company, TAC, without even knowing whether the quotations were from real companies (see \[10\] of the accused’s statement P27). Her conduct fell within category 2 of _Romel_, where the receiving party is paid to forbear from performing what he is duty bound to do, thereby conferring a benefit on the paying party: _Romel_ at \[26\]. In this case, it was the accused’s duty to secure legitimate competitive quotations, and hence the appropriate starting point for sentencing was a custodial sentence.

309    DPP Huang highlighted cases where other managing agents who corruptly accepted gratification from Ling or his staff, and had similarly breached their duties to their principals, had received custodial sentences. I reproduce, with some modifications, the table put up by the DPP Huang.

310    Further, as the accused was convicted after trial, the Prosecution argued that she should not be afforded any sentencing discount which would have been given to the other offenders who had elected to plead guilty, and hence the sentence imposed on her should therefore be slightly higher.

### Mitigation Plea

311    In its mitigation plea, the Defence submitted that

> (a)     The custodial threshold has not been crossed and that a high fine would commensurate with the harm and culpability of the accused in the present case. The quantum of fine could be calculated from the total amount of gratification received.

> (b)     However, the Defence submitted that in the event that the court determines that the custodial threshold has been crossed, the indicative global sentence should not be more than 3 months plus fine up to $100,000.

312    Based on the categorization of offences as set out in _Romel_, the Defence argued that for the current case, based on the charges that were made out, the charges essentially fell within the Romel 1 category. In particular, as regards the gratification of $3,000 for the jobs for Loyang Gardens in respect of the 3rd Charge (DAC-900248-2019), the accused did not have the power or influence to cause Kansai Paint to contract with TAC. Accordingly, for the purposes of sentencing, the accused’s culpability for this project must be lowered as the transaction was out of her control even though she received gratification for it.

313    It was also highlighted that the accused has no antecedents, and that she has done her due diligence and had not compromised in her duty to ensure that proper rectification works were carried out. Further, no complaints were received regarding the rectification works done by any of Donald Ling’s companies. In addition, the accused was candid and acknowledged that she had received money from Ling, the amounts received by the accused was not high, and neither Newman & Goh nor the MCSTs suffered any real losses. In light of the above considerations, the Defence argued that applying the two-stage, five-step sentencing framework set out by Justice Chan Seng Onn in _Takaaki Masui v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 4 SLR 160</span> (“**_Masui_**”), the present case falls within the slight harm and lower-end medium culpability range, and a high fine would be appropriate. In addition, the accused should not be punished for claiming trial to the charges, especially as not all the charges against her had been proven.

314    Further, citing the _Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts_ on Section 6(a) PCA, the Defence highlighted that it is stated that “for agents in the private sector, offences in the lower register of culpability are dealt with by the imposition of fines. Offences falling in the lower register are generally those where the amount of the gratification is below $30,000 and where there was no real detriment to the interests of the principle.” The custodial threshold is crossed where “gratification involved is significant, or where gratification was received over a lengthy period of time, … or where there has been compromise in duty, or where there is a serious betrayal of trust”.

315    Alternatively, the Defence submitted that if a custodial sentence should be imposed, the global sentence should not be more than 3 months plus fine up to $100,000. In this regard, the Defence cited the case of _Mohd Yusoff Bin Alias_, a co-accused in the same series of events with Donald Ling, whose charges involved a total gratification amount of $25,920. The offender there had pleaded guilty to 11 charges, and 22 charges were taken into consideration. He was sentenced to 20 weeks’ imprisonment plus $25,920 penalty.

316    The Defence argued that based on _Mohd Yusoff_ alone, it would be manifestly excessive if the accused’s term of imprisonment were to cross 20 weeks’ imprisonment (even after accounting for there being no sentencing discount because the accused claimed trial).

## The Court’s decision on Sentence

### Sentencing for Private Sector Corruption

317    Two seminal cases from the High Court set out comprehensive guidelines for the courts to adopt in sentencing offenders involved in private sector corruption. I discuss these cases more fully below.

318    In _Romel_, the learned Sundaresh Menon CJ had stated that “…Singapore has taken private sector corruption very seriously” \[19\], and that there is no “…presumption in favour of non-custodial sentences whenever private sector corruption is concerned”. \[20\]. Further, at \[23\] Honour noted that “…where private sector corruption involves (a) a significant amount of gratification; (b) gratification which is received over a lengthy period of time; or (c) a compromise of one’s duty or a serious betrayal of trust, the starting point is likely to be a custodial sentence…”

319    Menon CJ further explained that there were “three broad and non-exhaustive categories” where private sector corruption cases could be classified \[26\]:

> (a)    First, where the receiving party is paid to confer on the paying party a benefit that is within the receiving party’s power to confer, without regard to whether the paying party ought properly to have received that benefit. This is typically done at the payer’s behest.

> (b)    Second, where the receiving party is paid to forbear from performing what he is duty bound to do, thereby conferring a benefit on the paying party. Such benefit typically takes the form of avoiding prejudice which would be occasioned to the paying party if the receiving party discharged his duty as he ought to have. This also is typically done at the payer’s behest.

> (c)    Third, where a receiving party is paid so that he will forbear from inflicting harm on the paying party, even though there may be no lawful basis for the infliction of such harm. This is typically done at the receiving party’s behest.

320    The following examples are cases that fell into the first and second categories of private sector corruption cases[\[note: 43\]](#Ftn_43):

> \[27\]  A case falling within the first category occurs, for example, where the receiving party purchases or favourably recommends the goods or services offered by the paying party. This was what happened in Ang Seng Thor. In this category, whether the custodial threshold is crossed will depend on the facts.

> \[28\]  A case falling within the second category occurs, for example, where the receiving party, who is under a duty to inspect the paying party’s goods or work, slackens in his inspection or turns a blind eye to any deficiencies in the paying party’s goods or work. This was what happened in _Lim Teck Chye._ These cases, as I have noted above at \[23\] above, will frequently attract custodial sentences.

321    Importantly, Menon CJ stressed at \[31\] that:

> …these three categories are meant only as analytical tools for the very many factual scenarios in which corruption may manifest itself. These categories are not watertight; they shade into one another. They are also not intended to be determinative of any case. Instead, they serve as a reminder that sentencing, especially in the context of corruption, is an intensely factual exercise.

322    On the facts of _Romel_, the total amount of gratification accepted by the offender was USD7,200, and the money was given in return for falsely certifying inspections for vessels that were allowed to enter an oil terminal. The offender had pleaded guilty to two charges proceeded with (where the bribes totalled USD6,000) and a third charge was taken into consideration for sentencing. The learned Chief Justice was of the view that the facts for the first charge fell within the third category of private sector corruption cases, while the facts for the second charge fell within the second and third categories. Based on the facts, the offender was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment.[\[note: 44\]](#Ftn_44)

323    In the earlier case of _Ang Seng Thor_, which was also referred to in _Romel_, the learned V K Rajah JA (as he then was) set out the following considerations for private sector corruption cases:

> (a)     **_…the main sentencing considerations in corruption cases are deterrence and punishment…_** _It would not be wrong to say that in Singapore deterrence is always a relevant sentencing consideration in corruption cases.”_ (at \[33\]\])

> (b)    “_Although triggering the public service rationale is one way in which a private sector offender may be subject to a custodial sentence, it is not the only way: the custody threshold may be breached in other circumstances, depending on the applicable policy considerations and the gravity of the offence as measured by the mischief or likely consequence of the corruption (see Lim Teck Chye at \[65\] and Zhao Zhipeng at \[32\])”_ (at \[33(d)\]).

> (c)    “**_In addition, factors such as the size of the bribes, the number of people drawn into the web of corruption and whether such conduct was endemic will all be relevant to the consideration of whether a custodial sentence is justified_**.” (at \[33(d)\]).

> (d)    “_It should be absolutely clear that_ **_there is no presumption in favour of a non-custodial sentence for private sector corruption cases_**”. (at \[39\]).

> (e)    “…_there is clearly a_ **_public interest in the private sector_** _maintaining a_ **_reputation for being corruption free_**_, with_ **_business being conducted in a fair and transparent manner so as to ensure that the public’s legitimate expectations of bona fides, commercial even-handedness and economic welfare are not prejudiced, and the efficient operation of the market is not disrupted_**” (at \[41\]).

> (f)     _“…._ **_where cases of private sector corruption involve managers (especially senior managers) or concern corrupt influence over large or otherwise important business transactions, this would add greatly to the seriousness of the offence_** _. Courts should then seriously consider imposing custodial sentences to deter the establishment of a corrupt business culture in Singapore”. (_at \[42\]).

> (g)    “_Aggravating factors that tend to trigger the same deterrent reasoning include the fact that offences were systematic (as with a company or even industry-wide scheme of corruption) or that they occurred over a long period of time, as opposed to one-off incidents. There may or may not be many such cases, and all the facts must be taken into account, but_ **_there must be no suggestion that the courts are more indulgent with private sector offenders in serious corruption cases merely because the public service rationale is not directly relevant_**.” (at \[42\]).

> (h)     _“…_ **_the size of the bribes in a corrupt gratification offence is not only linked to the culpability of the offender. Rather, it is also related to the harm caused by the offence_** _(see the discussion of harm and culpability as basic sentencing factors in PP v Loqmanul Hakim bin Buang_ _<span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR(R) 753</span> at \[46\]–\[50\]_” (at \[46\])).

\[emphasis added\]

324    For _Ang Seng Thor_, the respondent had pleaded guilty to two charges of corruptly giving gratification totaling $147,158.00, to induce the receiver to order goods from the company in which the offender occupied a senior position. On appeal, his sentence was enhanced to a global sentence of 12 weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $50,000.

325    I would add that while the Defence also cited the decision of Chan Seng Oon J in _Masui_, it appears unclear if the sentencing framework set out by the High Court should be directly applied in the present case, in light of the subsequent remarks of the Court of Appeal in _Public Prosecutor v Takaaki Masui and another and other matters_ _<span class="citation">\[2021\] SGCA 119</span>._ There, the Court of Appeal, _when_ dealing with a criminal reference and criminal motions that were brought up in relation to that case involving Katsutoshi Ishibe (“Ishibe”) and Takaaki Masui (“Masui”) had expressed certain concerns about the above sentencing framework. At \[15\], the Court of Appeal stated:

> Although the sentencing framework devised by the Judge was not an issue before us, we caution that excessively complex or technical sentencing frameworks are prone to cause confusion and uncertainty, which are the very antithesis of a sound sentencing framework. As we previously observed in _Mohd Akebal s/o Ghulam Jilani v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 266</span> at \[20(b)\], sentencing benchmarks are never intended to achieve mathematically precise sentences. **_We therefore do not endorse the Judge’s sentencing framework, which is as complex as it is likely to be of little assistance to sentencing courts_**. In laying down a sentencing framework, the court should introduce only “as much complexity as \[is\] necessary to make \[the framework\] theoretically just without making it either incomprehensible or too intricate for practical application” (see John Bernard Corr, “Supreme Court Doctrine in the Trenches: The Case of Collateral Estoppel” (1985) 27 Wm & Mary L Rev 35 at 85).

\[emphasis added\]

326    The DPP also took the position that the framework advocated by Justice Chan should not be applied to the present case. Further, DPP Huang informed that the Court of Appeal has reserved judgment on a sentencing framework for private sector corruption offences under s6(a) and (b) PCA in _Goh Ngak Eng v PP_ (MA 9173/2021).

327    In light of the remarks made by the Court of Appeal in _Public Prosecutor v Takaaki Masui and another and other matters_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGCA 119</span> above, and the submission of the DPP, I was inclined to adopt the position advocated by the Prosecution.

### Individual and global sentences

328    The Prosecution also argued that the current case fell into the second category of private sector corruption identified by the learned Chief Justice in _Romel_. This classification was presumably important since the the learned Chief Justice had suggested that while a case that fell within the first category may result in a custodial sentence, cases that fell within the second category will “_frequently attract custodial sentences_”.

329    It appears that the factor deciding whether a case falls within the first or second categories is whether the benefit “is within the receiving party’s power to confer” (first category), or whether “the receiving party is paid to forbear from performing what he is duty bound to do, thereby conferring a benefit on the paying party” (second category). That said, the learned Chief Justice also made clear the “categories are not watertight” but “shade into one another,” and they are also not intended to be determinative of any case.

330    In the present case, the accused had stated that as regards the gratification she accepted from Ling, “…she understood that the money _for recommending and referring jobs to TAC”._ In the course of her dealings with Ling, she had asked for and received support quotations from TAC. She explained that she did not know if support quotations are from real companies, and she was also unable to recall the name of the company which TAC had used to provide a support quote (see, \[9\] \[10\], and \[31\] of P27).

331    It was arguable that the accused’s actions could fit either category 1 or 2 of the _Romel_ categories. That said, I was of the view that insisting on a clear cut and distinct categorisation was unnecessary in the present case, especially since Menon CJ had made it clear in _Romel_ itself that “(t)hese categories are not watertight; they shade into one another. They are also not intended to be determinative of any case…”

332    Instead, it appears that what was more important in determining sentence in the present case was to consider the various sentencing factors, many of which stemmed from the decisions in _Romel_ and _Ang Seng Thor_, which were also discussed in _Masui_ in some cases. Also, of importance, was to consider the sentences imposed in similar cases where managing agents were bribed for conferring similar benefits, including situations where the giver of the bribes was Ling himself. I would highlight below the main factors and cases which directly influenced the sentences that I imposed.

333    First, the gratification period, based on the charges that were made out, spanned a relatively long duration, and seven separate occasions. Also, for the seven charges that the accused was found guilty of, it would appear that the accused accepted bribes from Ling from between sometime after 18 March 2011 (2nd charge) to sometime after 27 April 2012 (9th charge). While the exact period could not be precisely determined, it would appear that the accused took money over the course estimated at about 12 – 13 months or so.

334    Second, the amounts ranged from less than $100, to $5,305, with significant sums in the hundreds and thousands for 5 out of the 7 charges made out. As noted by VK Rajah JA in _Ang Seng Thor_, the size of the bribes was linked not only to the culpability of the offender, but also the harm caused by the offences.

335    Third, Ling corrupted many managing agents, the accused amongst them. It would appear that such a bribe giving culture was endemic between contractors and managing agents, and this clearly worked against the interest of the MCSTs and condominium owners. Even going by the defence put up by the accused, while she denied accepting any of the 11 specific instances of gratification set out in the original charges, she nonetheless admitted to having accepted gratification, albeit on only one or two occasions from Ling. She also admitted to taking the money with the “understanding” that it was for referring and recommending jobs to Ling, something she clearly knew was a conflict of interest. That the accused took the money, kept it and spent it, and accepted some more, without even needing to ask him for the purpose of the money or for specific details of the gratification, sadly demonstrated the prevalent and apparently accepted nature of such bribery in the industry.

336    However, this apparently widespread practice of contractors giving bribes to managing agents who did, or could, potentially act against the interest of their principals, is clearly a blight on the entire real estate management industry. A custodial sentence was therefore necessary to deter and stem out such a practice.

337    Fourth, it should be noted that custodial sentences had been imposed in the five cases cited, four by the Prosecution and one by the Defence. These cases involved similar facts where the managing agents had accepted bribes from Ling or his staff as rewards for showing favour to them. As reflected in the table provided by the Prosecution, as well as the information contained in Annex B of the mitigation plea, for these offenders who had all pleaded guilty to the charges proceeded with, the imprisonment sentences imposed consisted of:

> (a)     one to two weeks have been imposed for sums ranging from $300 up to $896;

> (b)     three to four weeks have been imposed for sums ranging from $1,094 up to $2,200; and

> (c)     seven to ten weeks have been imposed for sums ranging from $3,623 up to $6,800.

338    Of course, sentences should not be determined in a strictly linear manner based solely on the amount accepted for the proceeded charges, nor should they always strictly be directly proportional to the gratification, since other sentencing factors would still have to be considered. Such factors include the total number of charges involved, both charges proceeded with and charges taken into consideration, and the total gratification accepted including for the TIC charges.

339    In addition, I considered that while the accused did not plead guilty and hence should not receive any sentencing discount normally granted for an early plea of guilt demonstrating remorse, the position she had always taken was that she did accept gratification from Ling on at least one or two occasions, and that based on the evidence available, not all the original charges against the accused had been made out.

340    Finally, as far as I could see, it would appear that Ling’s companies did in fact, carry out the jobs for which they were paid and which, as the Defence had pointed out, no complaints had been received regarding them. That said, in light of the bribe money given to the accused as a reward for showing favour to Ling’s companies, it was not entirely clear if the MCSTs, as principals of the accused, did get the best value for money when they engaged Ling’s companies to perform the jobs.

341    Taking everything into account, I imposed the following sentences:

342    I am of the view that the global sentence imposed is fair and proportionate, and in line with the relevant sentencing principles and sentencing precedents. I also imposed a penalty of S$7,183 in line with s 13 of the PCA. The default sentence is 2 weeks imprisonment.

343    At the request of the Defence, I agreed to defer the commencement of the accused’s imprisonment sentence to 13 July 2022. The accused has since surrendered and started serving her imprisonment term.

344    Finally, it leaves me to thank both the Prosecutor, and Counsel, for their thorough, well-researched, and comprehensive written submissions. These have certainly proven to be very helpful to this court in arriving at its verdict and final sentence on the charges.
