PROFESSIONS – medical profession and practice – liability

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in HC/DCA/53/2021 .\]

11 February 2022

### District Judge Wong Peck:

## Introduction

1       The plaintiff is a self-represented elderly gentleman who was unhappy with the left total knee replacement surgery that the second and third defendants had performed for him under a welfare scheme known as “Life Renewed”. The second and third defendants are the orthopaedic surgeons of the first defendant which is a medical partnership clinic. It was undisputed that the plaintiff did not pay for the surgery.

2       At the end of the trial, I found that the plaintiff had not proven his case and dismissed his claim. Being dissatisfied, the plaintiff has since appealed against my decision and these are the full grounds of my decision.

## Facts

### The parties

3       The plaintiff underwent a left total knee replacement surgery under the Life Renewed welfare scheme which is a Corporate Social Responsibility programme run by Mount Elizabeth Hospital Novena which provides full sponsorship of medical treatment for needy patients at the Mount Elizabeth Hospital Novena. The selection of patients to be placed in the programme is by Lion Befrienders Service Association, a voluntary welfare organisation registered with the National Council of Social Services and a partner of Mount Elizabeth Hospital Novena for this programme. The plaintiff was selected by Lion Befrienders Service Association for this programme for which he received fully sponsored medical treatment for the surgery.

4       It was undisputed that the plaintiff received a medical consultation with the second defendant on 10 December 2013 at the premises of the first defendant which is located at the Mount Elizabeth Novena Specialist Centre. He then underwent the left total knee replacement surgery on 19 December 2013. It was undisputed that he was discharged on 24 December 2013. Post-surgery, the plaintiff was first examined by the second defendant on 27 December 2013 and followed by the third defendant on 6 January 2014. There were subsequent review sessions.

5       On 13 July 2015, as there was a dislodgement of the polyethylene insert in his left knee as shown in MRI scans, revision surgery was discussed between the defendants and the plaintiff. However, the plaintiff did not agree to undergo the revision surgery as he claimed to be fearful of a recurrence of a similar displacement. According to the plaintiff, he continued to suffer pain in his left knee and reduced mobility. The present suit was then instituted by the plaintiff for breach of contract and medical negligence.

## The parties’ cases

### The plaintiff’s version

6       The plaintiff claimed that after the surgery, he continued to experience pain in his left knee despite assurances from the second and third defendants that the surgery was successful. The post-operation X-ray showed no adverse effects from the surgery. He claimed that he informed both doctors at the subsequent review consultations between December 2013 to December 2014 that he experienced severe pain in his left knee and was unable to walk properly as a result. However, further X-ray scans were reviewed by the third defendant who assured him that recovery was good.

7       On or around 25 May 2015, the plaintiff consulted Dr Anthony Gardner who reviewed MRI tests and further X-ray scans. Dr Gardner informed him that the plastic component of his tibial knee replacement baseplate did not appear to be in the correct position and wrote a memo to the second and third defendants to state that the polyethylene liner was displaced. On 11 June 2015, the second defendant confirmed such displacement and ordered further X-ray scans. On 13 June 2015, the third defendant offered revision surgery.

8       On 14 September 2015, the plaintiff consulted another doctor, Dr Lim Lian Arn, who rendered the same opinion that the polyethylene insert was displaced. A similar opinion was also rendered by Dr Brian Lee on 2 November 2015. On 24 March 2017, he obtained yet another report from Dr Godfrey James Charnley, an Orthopaedic consultant practising in the UK, who also made a similar report.

9       As he continued to experience pain in his left knee and reduced mobility, he was now claiming against the defendants for compensation and damages for his continuous pain and suffering.

10     In paragraphs 22 to 24 of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2), the alleged breach of contract and medical negligence on the part of the defendants had been particularised as follows:

> a.     the defendants failed to warn, sufficiently or at all, that there was a possible risk of a disengagement or dislodgement of the polyethylene liner from the tibial knee replacement baseplate arising from the surgery;

> b.     the defendants failed to take the required steps to prevent disengagement or dislodgment of the polyethylene liner from the tibial knee replacement baseplate during the surgery;

> c.     the defendants failed to firstly diagnose and detect that the polyethylene liner had dislodged from the plaintiff’s tibial knee replacement baseplate; secondly, take reasonable steps to investigate the plaintiff’s pain experienced in his left knee and thirdly, to carry out all or any investigations, examination and tests to ascertain the correct diagnosis; and

> d.     therefore, the defendants beached the standard of care and skill required of them in diagnosing, advising and treating the plaintiff under contract and tort.

### The defendants’ version

11     The defence as pleaded was straightforward. The defendants’ position was that there was no breach of contract as there was no contract existing between the parties. They also denied any wrongdoing and were thus not liable for negligence.

12     At the post surgery review on 27 December 2013, the second defendant noted that the wound was clean and the range of motion was 10 to 90 degrees. At the 6 January 2014 review conducted by the third defendant, the third defendant also noted that the wound was clean. The plaintiff did not complain of severe pain in his left knee nor difficulty in walking. Similar observations were made at the 5 February 2014 review. On 19 March 2014, the third defendant who conducted the review noted that the plaintiff was well and X-rays showed good alignment. At the 16 June 2014 review, the plaintiff was noted to be walking better in that he could walk 2 km daily.

13     It was at the 13 July 2015 review when the MRI scans showed the polyethylene liner displacement. The second defendant then discussed revision surgery and explained to the plaintiff that there was a low possibility of recurrence of displacement. At this same review, it was noted that the plaintiff was able to travel to Batam, Indonesia in June 2015 for a conference.

## Issues to be determined

14     The issues before the court were as follows:

> Issue 1- were the defendants liable for breach of contract?

> Issue 2- were the defendants liable for tort of negligence; in particular, failure to warn the plaintiff of the possible risk of displacement of the polyethylene liner arising from the surgery, failure to take steps to prevent displacement of the polyethylene liner and failure to diagnose, investigate and take reasonable steps to ascertain the cause of the plaintiff’s pain in his knee?

## Decision of the court

## Issue 1- were the defendants liable for breach of contract?

15     The defendants had pleaded in their Joint Defence (Amendment No 2) at paragraph 47 that there was no contract, express or implied between the parties. According to the defendants, there was no consideration. It is trite that for a contract to exist, there must be consideration.

16     According to Mr Sheng’s oral evidence in court, he was selected for surgery under a charitable organisation “Khazanah.” In addition, he agreed that he was not charged any fee by the defendants. Instead, Mr Sheng’s evidence is that the Mount Elizabeth hospital bill was settled by IHH Khazanah[^1]. Here, I agreed with the defendants that there was no consideration. Medical expense if any were either paid by Khazanah or through Life Renewed welfare scheme. Therefore, I found that there was no contract between the parties. I now move to the second issue pertaining to the claim in tort for alleged negligence.

## Issue 2- were the defendants liable for the tort of negligence?

## Was there any failure to warn, sufficiently or at all, that there was a possible risk of a disengagement or dislodgement of the polyethylene liner from the tibial knee replacement baseplate arising from the surgery?

17     Important and relevant medical advice rendered by doctors at consultations with their patients would include informing patients considering knee replacement surgery of the possibility of displacement of polyethylene liner from the tibial knee replacement baseplate arising from the surgery. The question would be whether such information was made available to the plaintiff at the consultation on 10 December 2013 prior to the surgery performed on 19 December 2013.

18     I found that the second defendant, who saw the plaintiff during the medical consultation on 10 December 2013, had warned the plaintiff of the complications of the surgery including a possible risk of a disengagement or dislodgement of the polyethylene liner from the tibial knee replacement baseplate arising from the surgery. I made my finding based on 2 contemporaneous documents. Firstly, the clinical notes made by the second defendant[^2] clearly stated that “surgery and complications discussed.” Further, the plaintiff had signed a consent form dated 10 December 2013 found at ABD 14. At \[1\] of the form[^3], the plaintiff made the declaration that he had understood the nature, purpose, risks and alternatives which were explained by the second defendant and consented to undergo the surgery.

## Did the defendants fail to take the required steps to prevent disengagement or dislodgment of the polyethylene liner from the tibial knee replacement baseplate during the surgery?

19     I found that the plaintiff has not proven that the defendants failed in this aspect. In this regard, I made the following observations of the medical witnesses’ evidence. Dr Ho Yew Min a senior consultant at the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Ng Teng Fong Hospital, who was called by the plaintiff to testify, made it clear on the witness stand that he was not the plaintiff’s expert witness. He insisted that he was in court to provide his evidence as a professional witness on his own report.

20     Dr Ho’s evidence was that he did not provide an opinion as to whether the defendants had fallen below the standard of care as physicians. He also refused to give an opinion as to whether the surgery went well. In Dr Ho’s report dated 15 Jul 2019[^4] at \[5\] under “History”, Dr Ho stated that “the text, based on notes from Mount Elizabeth Hospital at Novena, describes a well-established approach to performance of total knee replacement surgery with no untoward events documented.”

21     As for Dr Lim Lian Arn, who provided a medical report as the plaintiff’s witness, is an Orthopaedic Surgeon in private practice. In his report dated 9 March 2020, he merely diagnosed a dislodgment of the polyethylene liner and advised revision surgery. He did not comment on the issues before the Court.

22     In summary, both doctors’ evidence did not support the plaintiff’ claim that the defendants had failed to take the required steps to prevent the dislodgement of the polyethylene liner. I found that spontaneous dislodgment had occurred in the present case. I shall elaborate more.

## Did the defendants fail to firstly diagnose and detect that the polyethylene liner had dislodged from the plaintiff’s tibial knee replacement baseplate; secondly, take reasonable steps to investigate the plaintiff’s pain experienced in his left knee and thirdly, to carry out all or any investigations, examination and tests to ascertain the correct diagnosis?

23     The legal test to be applied is the Bolam test as endorsed by the Court of Appeal in _Khoo James and another v Gunapathy d/o Muniandy_ \[2002\] 1 SLR (R) 1024 at \[3\] and \[63\]. In essence, the defendants would not be negligent if they could establish that the diagnosis and treatment provided to the plaintiff was supported by the practices and opinion of a responsible body of medical practitioners. I found that the plaintiff had failed to prove that there was negligence on the part of the defendants such that it failed the Bolam test.

24     Firstly, I found that such dislodgements are rare. My finding was based on Dr Ho’s evidence that this was the first case of dislodgment that he had encountered and almost unheard of. He went further to indicate that dislodgement was a recognised possibility for this type of implants known as Genesis II. Dr Ho went further to also testify that the X-rays taken immediately after the operation[^5] were sub-optimal because portable machine was used. He also agreed that post-operation spontaneous dislodgement could occur and this hypothesis was supported by medical literature[^6] . Dr Ho, who was the plaintiff’s own witness, agreed[^7] that the operation notes described a well-established approach to performance of total knee replacement surgery with no untoward events documented.

25     I found that in reliance on the medical literature, that spontaneous dislodgment could occur and it occurred in the present case. However, I was unable to pin-point exactly when spontaneous dislodgment occurred in the present case. Dr Goh Seo Kiat, who was the defendant’s expert, testified in court that that he was not sure how the dislodgement occurred. Like Dr Ho’s evidence, Dr Goh also confirmed at \[31\] of his report[^8] that such dislodgements were indeed rare. Dr Goh also confirmed in his AEIC that the operation notes were a very standard text in total knee replacement and there was no suggestion of any inadequately performed surgery.

26     As the burden of proof was on the plaintiff to establish his claim, Dr Ho’s evidence did not support the plaintiff’s claim. Dr Ho’s evidence was that it was not X-rays taken immediately after the operation that could confirm dislodgement, it was CT scan and MRI scans but the established procedure was to conduct X-rays immediately after such operations. Hence, the defendants were not negligent in that proper procedure was followed.

27     Upon receiving the memo from Dr Anthony Gardner, the second defendant reviewed the X-rays after 11 June 2015 and arranged for a further evaluation of the implant using MRI scans. I found that after a review of the MRI confirmed there was dislodgement was 13 July 2015, the second defendant immediately offered revision surgery on the same day. However, the plaintiff agreed during cross-examination that he was the one who did not go for revision surgery as he could walk using a walking stick and could use the handle bars at staircases to climb stairs. Hence, I found that the defendants had taken reasonable steps to investigate and ascertain the cause of pain in the plaintiff’s leg. The defendants’ well meaning attempts to reassure the plaintiff about the revision surgery were futile as the plaintiff resolutely refused to go for the surgery.

28     The plaintiff had also filed a complaint with the Singapore Medical Council (“SMC”) relating to his unhappiness with the defendants. SMC is the governing body that regulates medical practitioners to ensure certain standards of medical practice are met. SMC rendered a report[^9] after the conclusion of inquiry by Complaints Committee 18/2018. The decision of SMC was to dismiss the complaint under section 49(1) of the Medical Registration Act (Cap 174, Rev Ed 2014). The basis of the complaint was similar to the present suit.

29     As there was no new evidence that surfaced in the course of this trial from the time of SMC Complaint was dealt with, there was no reason for me to disagree with the findings of the SMC. There was no appeal against the SMC decision although the plaintiff claimed that he wanted to appeal but was out of time to do so. I agreed with \[20\] of the SMC report. It stated that the dislodgement was a “retrospective diagnosis which could not have been easily made at the material time. In view of this, the CC did not think that the doctors have misdiagnosed Mr Sheng’s condition in post-Procedure reviews.”

30     The plaintiff informed the court that he did not require the private investigator Gilbert De Silva from Secure Guard to attend court to testify. This was despite Mr De Silva having furnished his report dated 12 June 2016[^10] after having observed the plaintiff for a week. This meant that the plaintiff was not challenging the evidence of Mr De Silva. The relevancy of Mr De Silva’s report pertained to quantification of damages if this Court had found the defendants liable for the tort of negligence and whether the plaintiff had been complaining to the defendants about his leg problems during the consultations as there was cause for such complaints.

31     The scope of Mr De Silva’ job was to verify if the plaintiff could carry out his daily routine like walking, sitting, climbing up and down stairs and movements of his legs and also document activities and any impediments observed.[^11] The surveillance took place from 19 April 2016 to 2 May 2016 which amounted to 7 days’ observation of the plaintiff.

32     A summary of Mr De Silva’ observations[^12] was that the plaintiff displayed “no discomfort or anxiety going about doing his daily routine.” The plaintiff was observed to have “remarkable use of both his legs in walking long distances, climbing up and down stairs”. The conclusion was that the plaintiff showed “no sign of pain or impediment.”

33     I found that based on Mr De Silva’s report which remained unchallenged by the plaintiff, the plaintiff in all likelihood did not complain of severe pain in his left knee nor difficulty in walking when he met the second and third defendants for consultations from the first post-operation review up until mid 2015 when the plaintiff consulted Dr Gardner. This meant that the spontaneous displacement of the polyethylene liner must have occurred well after the surgery sometime in 2015. Even after the displacement had occurred sometime in 2015, such displacement had not affected much of the plaintiff’s movement as claimed because Mr De Silva’ observations of the plaintiff in 2016 indicated that the plaintiff could go about his daily routine with no discomfort and he could even cycle around the neighbourhood.[^13]

## Conclusion

34     For the above reasons, I dismissed the plaintiff’s claim. After hearing parties on their submissions relating to costs and disbursements, I fixed the costs and disbursements accordingly to be paid by the plaintiff to the defendants.
