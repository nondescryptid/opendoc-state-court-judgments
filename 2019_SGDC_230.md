Negligence – Duty of care – Breach of duty – Contributory negligence

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in HC/DCA 35 of 2019.\]

12 November 2019

### District Judge Loo Ngan Chor:

1       For the purpose of the Plaintiff’s appeal against my decision to enter interlocutory judgment against the Defendant for 15% only of the Plaintiff’s damages, I rehearse below the reasons that I gave parties.

2       The traffic accident between the parties took place at past 5pm on 6th April 2015. The Plaintiff was riding his bicycle across a pedestrian crossing and the Defendant was driving a car when the accident happened. The main dispute is whether the traffic lights were showing green for the Defendant and a red man for pedestrians when the collision happened.

3       Jalan Buroh is a broad dual carriageway road in an industrial area. One carriageway leads towards Pioneer Road and the opposite carriageway towards Jurong Pier Road. There is a light-controlled pedestrian crossing linking No. 29 Jalan Buroh (which is on the side leading to Jurong Pier Road) and No. 30 Jalan Buroh (which is on that side that leads to Pioneer Road), at which a collision took place between the parties, resulting in serious injuries to the Plaintiff. Ironically, both parties were familiar with this place because this was where they work and the route they used to go home.

4       It was not disputed that the Plaintiff was cycling across the pedestrian crossing. His riding thus, without dismounting from his bicycle, was a breach of rule 10 of the Road Traffic (Bicycles) Rules (R3, 1990 Revised edn), for which he was issued with a warning (1AB1). He is a foreign worker and was leaving his work place for his dormitory. His case at trial was that he had pressed the pedestrian button on the No. 30 side, and when the pedestrian green man came on, he rode across that carriageway. When he came to the divider separating that carriageway from the other side, he again pressed the pedestrian button and when the green man came on, he rode across. Traffic was heavy as might be expected for that time of the evening. He had ridden across the first three lanes and was across the fourth lane when the Defendant’s car struck him from his left. The Plaintiff was flung off the bicycle, landed on the Defendant’s car bonnet before hitting the left front windscreen of the Defendant’s car, causing the windscreen to crack with a spider’s web formation, and finally landed on the road. He was conveyed by an ambulance to the hospital. Fortunately, the Plaintiff has recovered from his injuries.

5       The Defendant was leaving No. 30 Jalan Buroh where he worked, for home, _i.e._ from the same carriageway towards Pioneer Road, where the Plaintiff was a little while later to start riding his bicycle across. He made a U-turn after travelling 1100 to 1200m along that carriageway. He switched lanes not long after making the U-turn, and moved along the fourth lane in the direction of Jurong Pier Road. Traffic was heavy on the first three lanes, with mostly heavy vehicles. The fourth lane was plain sailing with only a car some distance ahead of him. The Defendant said that he was driving at about 40kph when the Plaintiff suddenly appeared from the right in front of his car over the pedestrian crossing. With no time to react, the accident resulted.

6       The Plaintiff was his own sole witness of fact. He also called an accident re-constructionist, Mr Melvin Lum, to testify for him. The Defendant had a passenger in his car, a Myanmar lady, whom he did not call as a witness because she did not pay attention to the road and did not see the accident when it happened. Driving a large private passenger bus somewhere obliquely behind the Defendant, but on the third lane, Mr Victor Jiang Yalong, testified for the Defendant.

7       Although both parties agreed that the traffic was heavy on the carriageway towards Jurong Pier Road, the Plaintiff’s evidence was that the vehicles right of him, past the pedestrian crossing, were about 4m away. He said that two cars and a heavy vehicle occupied the first three lanes on his left side, and they had stopped before the pedestrian crossing, as the traffic light had turned red against them. On the other hand, the Defendant’s evidence was that traffic on the first three lanes was hardly moving over a long distance as he drove down the fourth lane. The traffic was so heavy that even though the traffic light was green, heavy vehicles had stopped behind the pedestrian crossing as the space after the crossing was filled with other vehicles. Mr Jiang’s evidence was that traffic was slow moving over like 500m or so.

8       Mr Jiang’s evidence was that because traffic was quite slow moving, he had time to observe what was around him. When he was about 70m from the pedestrian crossing, he noticed the collision in question and an object, possibly the Plaintiff’s bicycle, flying up in the air. He took note of the traffic light which was green. When he had made his way past the pedestrian crossing and could park somewhere near a flyover, he came back to the scene of the collision and told the Defendant that he saw the accident and gave the Defendant his handphone number in case he was required as an eyewitness.

9       In the case before me, if the pedestrian crossing light showed a green man, it had to mean that the traffic light for vehicles was red, and vice versa, _i.e._, red man and green traffic light (P2). This being so, either party had to be extremely careless in failing to heed or notice the state of the traffic lights. In respect of the Plaintiff, I was particularly conscious of the fact that if it were he who failed to comply with a red man sign, he could not have failed to realise that it meant a real risk of an accident and bodily injury to himself.

10     Nevertheless, reluctant as I was to come to that conclusion, my finding was that the Plaintiff did ride across the pedestrian crossing when the red man was showing against him and the traffic light was green in favour of the Defendant.

11     Looming large in the evidence was the testimony of Mr Jiang, the eyewitness, whose independence and testimony I had really been given no reason to doubt at all. In a plain way, his position was very simply that when the collision took place, the traffic light was green in favour of the Defendant. Mr Mahendran’s efforts at showing that Mr Jiang could not really see the state of the traffic light given that heavy vehicles in front of him would have blocked his view were unavailing. In this connection, I did not accept the Plaintiff’s allegation that the branches of a tree overhung the standing traffic light and blocked the Defendant’s view, a position that was controverted by the defence.

12     Given the fact that the Defendant did call Mr Jiang as his witness, I had no reason to doubt the Defendant when he said that he did not call his passenger to come to court because she had not seen the accident, as opposed to counsel’s suggestion that perhaps he was withholding unfavourable evidence.

13     The Defendant made his police report (1AB3) at 7:58pm, within three hours of the accident. The gist of his case had remained consistent since – traffic was heavy; heavy vehicles were behind the stop line even though the traffic light showed green; the Plaintiff suddenly appeared from the right on his bicycle; and that Mr Jiang had seen the accident.

14      _Per contra_, the Plaintiff’s police report made on 14th April 2015 (1AB9), several days after his discharge from hospital, did not have the same consistency. I noted that the Plaintiff suffered a memory lapse for some time after the accident. The Plaintiff’s police report did not mention that when he was at the divider between the carriageways, he pressed on the pedestrian button again. In his police report, he said only that he pressed on the pedestrian button before he took the carriageway towards Pioneer Road.

15     Mr Lum’s expert evidence did not add value to the case overall. I agreed with Mr Teo Weng Kie that Mr Lum’s evidence was one of over-reach in that, based on little objective evidence, and solely on what the Plaintiff told him, of which there was no separate record, and the fact that vehicles were behind the stop line, Mr Lum could make bold to conclude that the traffic light was red against the Defendant. I noted the refrain expressed by Choo Han Teck J in _Asnah bte Ab Rahman_ v _Li Jianlin_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 198</span> concerning the limited or negative utility of accident reconstruction especially when it came to determining fault. Mr Lum’s report (P1/64) at \[60\] that he inferred that the traffic light was red because “the heavy vehicles had stopped” took account of the Defendant’s police report (which Mr Lum had read) but not of the Defendant’s AEIC (\[9\]) or his sketch in the GIA statement (BA100) that there were heavy vehicles on each side of the pedestrian crossing.

16     With great respect, in the highest traditions of the bar, Mr Teo had referred me to the Court of Appeal decision in _Ng Weng Cheong_ v _Soh Oh Loo and another_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] SGCA 22</span>, a case that stood against the proposition that he argued for and he sought to distinguish. In that case, the appellant pedestrian was crossing a controlled pedestrian crossing on a three-lane carriageway when the red man was against him. The first respondent was driving an SBS bus intending to make a right turn when the traffic light was in his favour. He was travelling at 35 to 42kph and did not slow down even though his view of the pedestrian crossing was partially blocked by vehicles. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal of the pedestrian although the court found that he was 70% contributorily negligent. The first respondent was found to be 30% to blame because he had breached rules 5 and 7 of the Road Traffic (Pedestrian Crossings) Rules 1982 in not slowing down when his view of the pedestrian crossing was blocked and thus in dismissing the possibility that a pedestrian was about. The court reasoned thus:

> 20    Rule 5 lays down the general requirement applicable, as we say, to both controlled and uncontrolled crossings. It in terms requires the driver of a vehicle approaching any pedestrian crossing, whether controlled or not, to approach it at such a speed as will enable him to stop his vehicle before reaching the crossing, _unless he can see that there is no one on the crossing_.

> 26    It is incumbent upon the driver of a vehicle to approach any pedestrian crossing in the manner required by r 5 and _to keep a proper lookout to see that there are no pedestrians on it or about to enter it_.

> 27    At controlled crossings, a driver is not exonerated from his duty under r 5 and r 7 by the fact that the pedestrian started crossing when the light was against the pedestrian. It is not the driver’s concern whether the pedestrian has gone against the light in getting on to the crossing. Indeed, at controlled junctions, the driver is not intended to be guided by the light signals that regulate the pedestrian traffic. He is often not in the best position to see those signals.

> 42    On the facts, and on the view we take as to the construction of rr 5 and 7 of the Rules, we are of the view that the first respondent was in breach of these two rules.

> 43    The first respondent said that he was travelling at 35 to 42kmph. There is no indication that he slowed down at all when approaching the junction, even though his view of the pedestrian crossing was partially blocked. He clearly dismissed totally the possibility of anyone being on the crossing.

> 44    The appellant, on the other hand, should not have gone on the crossing against the lights. He must have been encouraged to start the crossing when he saw the vehicles in the lanes nearer to him come to a stop. The first respondent could not see him until he was about 10 to 12ft away. In attempting to cross the road in this manner, the appellant was quite heedless of his own safety.

> 45    We think the appellant was more to blame for the accident than was the first respondent. We would apportion blame in the proportion of 70% to 30% in favour of the first respondent.

> (emphasis added)

17     The defence had urged that I find the Plaintiff wholly to blame for the accident, compared to the appellant in _Ng Weng Cheong_. It was argued that the Plaintiff was not a pedestrian as he was cycling and his speed was “substantially faster than a pedestrian on foot”. After careful thought, I was not able to completely agree with the defence. I did agree, however, that the Plaintiff’s contributory negligence should be higher than that of the appellant’s 70% in _Ng Weng Cheong_.

18     The Defendant had testified that he was aware of pedestrians rushing across the crossing in the evenings so as to catch the bus. Although he was driving at a slow speed of 40kph, he did not slow down further when admittedly his view of the crossing was seriously obstructed by heavy vehicles on his right side.

19     In my humble view, given that the Defendant’s view was blocked by heavy vehicles and his reasonable knowledge that there could be pedestrians in a hurry, the Defendant should, as I explain next, have slowed down much more from 40kph (which was the speed the Defendant said he moved at, compared to Mr Lum’s opined evidence of 33kph) to a speed that would have allowed him to bring his car to a stop should he see a _pedestrian_ walking in front of the adjacent stationary lorry. Given that the Defendant’s car would be almost alongside the front of the adjacent lorry before such a pedestrian would come into view, I think that the Defendant’s speed should have been very slow indeed for him to stop in time and not hit such a pedestrian. While keeping such a speed would not have avoided this accident since the Plaintiff was riding his bicycle and was not a pedestrian, the Defendant’s response and braking would have been far more effective in mitigating the effects of the accident on the Plaintiff. In this sense, the Defendant’s negligence did cause the accident, albeit in a small degree.

20     In thus following the reasoning in _Ng Weng Cheong_, by which I was bound, I found that the Defendant should, seeing that his view of the crossing was obstructed and conscious of the fact that pedestrians may attempt to cross even as they should not, have slowed down much further from his 40kph. For this reason, and doing the best I could, I held that the Defendant should be liable for 15% of the Plaintiff’s damages to be assessed, with interest and costs reserved to the assessing Registrar, _i.e._, the Plaintiff was 85% contributorily negligent.
