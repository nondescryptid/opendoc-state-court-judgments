Tort – Negligence – Damages – Loss of earning capacity

6 July 2020

### District Judge Tan May Tee:

## Introduction

1       This is the plaintiff’s appeal from the decision of a deputy registrar (“DR”) given on 15 January 2020 in an assessment of damages arising from personal injuries sustained in a road traffic accident. The appeal is against two orders made by the DR, namely: (a) that the plaintiff be awarded $10,000 for loss of earning capacity (“LEC”); and (b) that the defendant pay the plaintiff costs of the action fixed at $18,000 plus GST and disbursements to be agreed, if not, taxed[^1].

2       The plaintiff seeks an increase in the sums awarded by the DR as set out in the following table:

## Background

3       This is how the accident happened. On 16 July 2015, the plaintiff was travelling to work on the first defendant’s bus which was driven at the material time by the second defendant. He was standing at the exit door of the bus when it suddenly braked causing him to fall. He sustained injuries to his head as well as a subtrochanteric fracture to his right femur. He was conveyed to the National University Hospital where he underwent surgery to repair the fractured femur. Due to non-union of the fracture – one of the screws had backed out for the bone – he had to undergo a second procedure which involved bone grafting after which he made good recovery.

4       The trial of the action on the issue of liability concluded on 24 May 2018 with interlocutory judgment being entered in the plaintiff’s favour at 70%. He was found contributorily negligent at 30% due to his failure to hold on to the grab poles on the bus at the material time.

5       For the assessment of damages, the plaintiff filed one affidavit of evidence-in-chief[^2] (“AEIC”) on 5 October 2018. He set out his various claims and elaborated _inter alia_ on his hospitalisation and treatment, his residual disabilities, his medical and transport expenses and loss of earnings.

6       For his claim for LEC and/or loss of future earnings (“LFE”), he stated that he was 66 years old when the accident occurred. He was then working as a shipyard supervisor under a one-year re-employment contract[^3] with a company called Heinen & Hopman Engineering Singapore Pte Ltd (“the Company”) which started on 1 June 2015. His basic monthly salary was $3,280 with a fixed allowance of $600, and he was also entitled to overtime pay. His work was essentially physical in nature and he was frequently working outdoors[^4].

7       He explained further his employment experience and aspirations as follows[^5]:

> 47.    I started working for the Company on 16 February 1993. Up until the end of my employment with the Company on 31 May 2016, I have worked more than 23 years for the Company. I have even won a long service award at the Company, and a letter from the Company stating the same dated 10 November 2014 is exhibited herein.

> 48.    As such, when I approached the retirement age of 65, the Company offered me a re-contract. This was because the Company deeply valued my experience and contribution towards them in light of my long service with them, and wanted me to continue helping them with my expertise even up till the age of 75. A letter from the Company dated 12 January 2017, stating that the Company would have offered recontracts with me until the age of 75 is exhibited herein.

> 49.    I would like to inform this Honourable Court that I enjoyed my job and I appreciate the recognition that the Company gave towards my service for the Company. Hence, I accepted the re-contract, and had planned even to continue to work for the Company for as long as my health allowed. This meant that I would have worked till the age of 75.

8       In the specialist medical reports[^6] tendered by the plaintiff, the evidence from the medical experts showed that the injuries had left him with permanent limitations to his functional ability to perform a physically demanding job. He was clinically observed to walk with an antalgic gait and found to have a restricted range of motion in his right hip.

9       Due to his injuries, the plaintiff could not return to work. He was on continuous medical leave of 355 days from the date of the accident up to 30 June 2016[^7]. The one-year re-employment contract which he had until 31 May 2016 was not renewed. The plaintiff has been unemployed since the expiry of his re-employment contract.

10     Besides his re-employment contract, the plaintiff exhibited in his AEIC two letters from the Company which became a bone of contention between the parties. The first letter[^8] was dated 18 May 2016 (“First Letter”) and it was addressed to the plaintiff informing him of the non-renewal of his employment contract ending 31 May 2016 as follows:

> “As you may know, due to the downturn of the economy, our ongoing projects are slowing down and no new projects secured at this moment. The Management has decided not to renew your contract at this time. We appreciate your valuable contributions to the organization.”

11     The second letter dated 12 January 2017 (“Second Letter”) was addressed to the plaintiff’s solicitors, and it stated as follows:

> Mr Lee Peng Sung had worked for our company, Heinen & Hopman Engineering Singapore Pte Ltd from 16th February 1993 to 31st May 2016 before his tenure was being cut short by the unfortunate accident.

> Throughout his service with us, Mr Lee has been an exceptional employee, bringing along with him invaluable experience and expertise for the company. Rising through the ranks to reach his last role as a Supervisor, Mr Lee has also been a great mentor to his peers in the workplace.

> Although he had already reached his retirement age, we extended his contract with the company as we continue to need his guidance and expertise in all of our current projects. Health condition permitting, we would have wanted to offer re-contracts with Mr Lee until the age of 75.

> It is indeed a great loss to our company that we can no longer engage his services due to this sudden accident. We wish him the best as he continues with his rehabilitation journey.

12     The two letters appeared to have been signed by different directors of the Company[^9] although the signatory of the second letter was also named in the first letter. In his AEIC, the plaintiff had made no mention of the first letter although he had included it as part of the documents exhibited therein.

## The assessment of damages hearing and the DR’s decision

13     At the assessment of damages before the DR, no witnesses were called. The DR was informed that the parties had reached agreement on the various heads of claim save for LFE. They had agreed to dispense with the attendance of witnesses and the assessment proceeded with the DR hearing only the parties’ respective submissions. Subsequently, the DR directed that further written submissions be filed on the issue of whether LEC should be awarded in lieu of LFE, and if so, what should be the appropriate sum[^10].

14     After considering the further submissions, the DR delivered his oral judgment in which he stated and explained his finding that the plaintiff had failed to discharge his burden of proof in relation to his claim for LFE[^11].

15     In his analysis of the plaintiff’s claim for LFE, the DR had ruled that the Second Letter from the Company which the plaintiff relied on to prove that he would have remained employed but for the accident was hearsay. The DR noted in this regard that the plaintiff had failed to file the requisite notice to admit hearsay pursuant to O 38 r 4. Further, this Second Letter was somewhat contradicted by the First Letter dated 18 May 2016 which attributed the Company’s decision not to renew the plaintiff’s contract to a downturn in the economy rather than the plaintiff’s health condition. Since the plaintiff had failed to call the employer as a witness, it was not possible to assess the credibility of the two apparently contradictory statements given by the employer at different times. The DR was nonetheless inclined to accord more weight to the First Letter which was issued contemporaneously whereas it was not clear under what circumstances the Second Letter had been issued. It was also significant that the second letter made no reference to the First Letter when they were both signed by the same director.

16     The DR found that the plaintiff’s case for LFE was deficient as he had adduced no evidence of what would have been his income post-accident. There was no mention of the terms on which his contract would have been renewed. Neither was there any evidence led as to what alternative employment the plaintiff could be engaged in based on his post-accident condition. Due to the dearth of evidence, the DR was unable to properly assess what would have been the plaintiff’s post-accident income. Hence, the LFE claim was rejected.

17     On the basis that the court has the discretion to award damages for LEC in lieu of LFE, the DR went on to rule that given the unchallenged medical evidence, the plaintiff’s injuries would prevent him from competing in the market for his pre-accident job.

18     As regards the quantum for LEC[^12], the DR felt that he was constrained by case precedents. Taking the plaintiff’s advanced age of 70 years to be the central consideration and according some weight to the fact that, at the time of the accident, the plaintiff had continued to work way past the statutory retirement age and his desire to continue working until 75 years of age had he not met with the accident, the DR awarded LEC in the sum of $10,000. In coming to his decision, the DR referred to four cases where the plaintiffs were also past retirement age, namely:

> (a)      _Ting Heng Mee v Sin Sheng Fresh Fruits_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGHC 43</span>;

> (b)      _Lee Mui Yeng v Ng Tong Yoo_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 46</span>;

> (c)      _Wong Yok Moy nee Teow Yok Moy v Ang Lay Tin & Anor_ (DC Suit No. 559 of 2004); and

> (d)      _Tan Kim Lee v Mohd Yusof bin Hussain & Anor_ (DC Suit No. 3084 of 2000).

19     The quantum of $10,000 awarded by the DR as LEC was in fact much higher than any of the cases referred to as he had taken into account the significantly higher salary that the plaintiff was drawing at the time of the accident. He also took into account the presumption that the plaintiff could have continued working in an alternative capacity notwithstanding his residual disabilities.

20     The DR had distinguished the case of _Quek Yen Fei Kenneth (by his litigation representative Pang Choy Chun) v Yeo Chye Huat and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 229</span> (“_Kenneth Quek”_) which was heavily relied on by counsel for the plaintiff. The DR was of the view that the multiplier/multiplicand approach adopted in _Kenneth Quek_ for determining LEC based on certain statistics provided to the court could not be used in the present case due to the absence of concrete evidence[^13].

## Issues

21     Since the plaintiff’s appeal is only against the DR’s assessment of the quantum for LEC, and not against his finding that the plaintiff’s claim for LFE was not proven, the issues which I have to decide based on the notice of appeal are as follows:

> (a)     what should be the appropriate sum to award as LEC to the plaintiff having regard to his age and specific circumstances; and

> (b)     whether the costs of the action fixed by the DR at $18,000 in the exercise of his discretion ought to be increased.

22     In determining the above issues, I am guided by the principles laid down by the Court of Appeal decision in _Tan Boon Heng v Lau Pang Cheng David_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 4 SLR 718</span> (“_Tan Boon Heng_”), namely that the judge in chambers is entitled to exercise his discretion unfettered by that of the registrar although due weight should be given to the latter’s decision. With regard to findings of fact by the registrar, the Court of Appeal held that where the registrar’s findings of fact are based on affidavit or documentary evidence, the judge in chambers will be in just as good a position as the registrar to make his assessment. In such a case (as it is in the present case before me), the judge is entitled to make his own findings of fact on the admitted documentary and affidavit evidence and draw the appropriate inferences from this evidence as well as the registrar’s notes of hearing, see _Tan Boon Heng_ at \[44\] and \[46\].

## What should be the appropriate sum to award as LEC to the plaintiff?

### Plaintiff’s case

23     When the appeal came up for hearing before me, counsel for the plaintiff made the following arguments:

> (a)     The learned DR had erred in rejecting the two letters from the plaintiff’s former employer as hearsay. This was because the defendants had failed to comply with the proper procedure for raising objections to the contents of the AEIC as set out in the State Courts Practice Directions PD 58, and in accordance with the timelines stated in the order of court made on 19 July 2018 pursuant to O 37 directions. The hearsay objection was raised belatedly in the defendants’ further submissions filed on 26 December 2019.

> (b)     Consequently, the issue of hearsay was not properly addressed at the hearing before the DR which led to an inconsistent evaluation by the DR of the weight to be accorded to the two letters from the Company. It was erroneous for the DR to exclude the Second Letter as hearsay while on the other hand giving weight to the First Letter. If the two letters were technically hearsay, then the DR ought to have disregarded them both and focused his mind on the remaining evidence in support of the plaintiff’s claim for LEC.

> (c)     As to the remaining evidence, the unchallenged evidence of the plaintiff is that:

>> (i)       At the time of the accident, he was a shipyard supervisor at the Company where he had been working for over 23 years and had received a long service award from them.

>> (ii)       He was re-employed on 1 June 2015 at the same basic salary of $3,280 plus an allowance of $600.

>> (iii)       The Company deeply valued his experience and contribution in light of his long service with them and wanted him to continue helping them with his expertise up till the age of 75 years.

>> (iv)       He enjoyed his job and planned to work for the Company as long as his health allowed.

>> (v)       His job scope required him to supervise his colleagues and be involved in activities like climbing to reach the air-conditioning or ventilation systems on a ship or oil rig, driving his workers around as well as cycle or walk to and from worksites.

>> (vi)       After the accident, his employment contract was not terminated. It was not renewed as a result of the accident.

>> (vii)       If not for the accident, he would have continued to work until at least the age of 75 years or for as long as his health permitted.

> (d)     The evidence of the plaintiff’s doctors which was also unchallenged is _inter alia_ as follows:

>> (i)       Dr Gavin O’Neill, the consultant at the National University Hospital, had stated that there would be significant limitation to the plaintiff’s ability to perform either, a job which requires heavy lifting or prolonged standing or operating in awkward areas or positions.

>> (ii)       The specialist he consulted, Dr K Kannan of the Centre for Orthopaedics, had opined that the plaintiff had sustained extensive right lower limb injuries. This has affected his lower limb biomechanics to the extent that he is unable to perform a normal gait and some of his daily activities. This is a permanent disability. Dr Kannan had also noted that the plaintiff has a permanent shortening of the right leg. The slight limb length discrepancy would make his gait difficult as he would have to expend more energy moving his right leg. Further, while there is clinical and radiological evidence of a union of the femur fracture, prolonged and continued weight bearing, like a manual job or sports, would cause him pain at the fracture site. As such, if he were still in the same job, he would face difficulty at work and would be unable to return to his job which was physical in nature.

> (e)     In relation to the quantum for LEC, the DR was incorrect in constraining himself to case precedents.

> (f)     The learned DR was incorrect in declining to apply the multiplier/multiplicand approach in _Kenneth Quek_.

> (g)     The DR’s award of $10,000 amounted to an under-compensation of the plaintiff.

24     In her further written submissions[^14] filed after the hearing upon the court’s invitation, counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the unchallenged evidence of the plaintiff must be deemed accepted in its entirety since the defendant had opted not to cross-examine either the plaintiff or the doctors. The rule in _Browne v Dunne_ (1893) 6 R 57 was cited in support of the proposition that where evidence is not challenged, it is considered by the court to be undisputed by the opposing party, and therefore accepted.

25     As to the admissibility of the two letters from the Company, counsel for the plaintiff accepted that they were hearsay and could only be admitted if they fell within the exceptions to the hearsay rule. In this case, the exceptions set out in s 32(1) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97) (“EA”) which would allow the letters to be admissible despite their maker being absent did not apply. The two letters from the Company were inadmissible and should not have been accorded any weight by the DR.

26     In considering the plaintiff’s claim for LEC, the focus should instead be on the remaining unchallenged evidence of the plaintiff and his medical experts.

27     As for the quantum for LEC, it was urged upon the court following the case of _Moeliker v A Reyrolle & Co Ltd_ \[1977\] 1 All ER 9 _(“Moeliker”)_ and the commentary from _Kemp & Kemp_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 2015) _(“Kemp & Kemp”)_ that the following factors ought to be considered, namely[^15]

> (a)     the net annual income of the claimant – while _Moeliker_ had eschewed the multiplier/multiplicand approach, it was suggested that the starting point should be the amount which the claimant was earning at the time of the trial;

> (b)     the length of the remainder of his working life – the longer the remaining period the higher should be the award and the shorter the period the lower the award;

> (c)     the level of risk and the number of times that the claimant will be on the labour market – _Kemp & Kemp_ explains that each time in the future that the claimant is searching for work, he would be exposed to further loss as a result of his restriction on the labour market caused by his injuries; and

> (d)     the effect of the claimant’s disability/handicap on his work capacity – this stage of the assessment considers (see _Moeliker_ at \[1977\] 1 WLR at 141,142):

>> “… how far he would be handicapped by his disability if he was thrown on the labour market – that is, what would be his chances of getting a job, and an equally well paid job. Again, all sorts of variable factors will, or may, be relevant in particular cases – for example, a plaintiff's age; his skills; the nature of his disability; whether he is only capable of one type of work, or whether he is, or could become, capable of others; whether he is tied to working in one particular area; the general employment situation in his trade or his area, or both.”

28     Applying the first factor stated above, counsel for the plaintiff submitted that since the plaintiff was unemployed at the time of the trial, his last drawn income should be considered. This sum, which was worked out to be $4,654.30, included not just the basic salary but also his allowance, overtime pay and Central Provident Fund contributions. As for the second factor – an estimate of the length of the rest of his working life, it was submitted that the unchallenged evidence of the plaintiff was that he would have continued to work until the age of 75 years. Since the plaintiff was 70 years of age at the assessment, this leaves a remaining working life of five years. On the third factor – the level of risk that he would be on the labour market – that risk had already materialised given that he was not re-contracted as a result of the accident. As to the fourth factor – the effect of his disability on his capacity to work, the medical evidence that he would be disadvantaged in the labour market had gone unchallenged.

29     As to guidance on quantum of LEC awards, counsel for the plaintiff referred additionally to _Kemp & Kemp_ where, at p 10039, the learned editors had commented with regard to _Smith v Manchester (_referred to as “_S&M”_) awards that “_S&M awards are usually limited to between six months and five years loss of the claimant’s present net annual salary_”. By this yardstick, it was submitted that the DR’s award of $10,000 which amounted to about three months of the plaintiff’s basic salary was wholly inadequate and would undercompensate the plaintiff. Accordingly, it was reiterated that the sum of $110,000 which represented two years’ loss of income, based on his monthly income of $4,654.30, would be a fair award in the circumstances.

### Defendants’ case

30     Concerning the admissibility of the two letters from the Company, counsel for the defendants maintained his submission that they were hearsay. The two letters would nonetheless fall to be considered under s 32(1)(b)(iv) of the EA which allows for the admissibility of statements made by a person in the ordinary course of a trade or business and in particular when it consists of:

> (iv)     a document constituting, or forming part of the records (whether past or present) of a trade, business, profession or other occupation that are recorded, owned or kept by any person, body or organisation carrying out the trade, business, profession or other occupation …

31     The court has a discretion whether or not to exclude such statements under s 32(3) of the EA which states:

> "32.— (3)    A statement which is otherwise relevant under subsection (1) shall not be relevant if the court is of the view that it would not be in the interests of justice to treat it as relevant.

32     Counsel for the defendants referred to the judgment of the Court of Appeal in _Gimpex Ltd v Unity Holdings Business Ltd and others and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 2 SLR 686</span> _(“Gimpex”)_ which dealt with the scope and application of s 32(3) EA. The Court of Appeal in _Gimpex_ had referred to the insightful analysis of Professor Pinsler in his article, “_Admissibility and the Discretion to Exclude Evidence: In Search of a Systematic Approach_” <span class="citation">(2013) 25 SAcLJ 215</span> and (see _Gimpex_ at \[105\] to \[109\]) endorsed the learned professor’s view that in exercising its discretion pursuant to s 32(3) of the EA,

> … the issue at hand was whether admissible evidence should be excluded because other countervailing factors outweighed the benefit of having the evidence admitted. In particular, where the hearsay evidence sought to be admitted was of limited probative value, such evidence should properly be excluded. The effect of this is that the party seeking the admission of the hearsay evidence had to be able to show the court that there were certain safeguards or measures that applied to that evidence which would ensure a minimal degree of reliability:

33     Relying on the dicta in _Gimpex_, the defendants submitted that what is in issue is the reason why the plaintiff's contract with his ex-employer was not renewed and whether there was any causal link to his injury from the accident.

34     It was contended that the First Letter issued by the Company near the end of the expiry of the plaintiff's contract informing him of the non-renewal of his contract was a statement made in the ordinary course of business within the exception in s 32(l)(b)(iv) of the EA. The First Letter had stated that the contract was not renewed due to a downturn of the economy and slowing down of ongoing projects. The Second Letter obtained approximately eight months after the First Letter contradicts the First Letter as it suggests that the plaintiff would have remained employed but for the accident. The Second Letter issued to the plaintiff's solicitors months after the expiry of the plaintiffs contract, arguably, did not amount to a statement from the Company made in the ordinary course of business and does not fall within the exception in s. 32(l)(b) of the Evidence Act. The Second Letter (contradicting the First Letter), if admitted in evidence, would result in confusion and have a misleading effect.

35     The defendants argued that the court should admit the First Letter under s 32(l)(b) of the EA and exclude the Second Letter in the interests of justice pursuant to s 32(3) EA. Even if the court were to find that the Second Letter is not completely unreliable to justify exclusion, minimal weight should be accorded to it. The court has a discretion to assign proper weight to statements admitted under s 32(1) as it deems fit as set out in s 32(5) of the EA.

36     Aside from the two letters, the defendants argued that the plaintiff's assertion that his ex-employer would have offered him re-contracts until the age of 75 years was self-serving and presumptuous. The plaintiff had conveniently omitted to refer to the First Letter in his AEIC when seeking an award for LFE/LEC. To prevent any injustice from the plaintiff asserting an untrue reason for the non-renewal of his employment contract, the First Letter should be relied on. It was submitted that the Second Letter was addressed to the plaintiff's solicitors and sounded more like a testimony rather than a document to inform the plaintiff of the official reason for non-renewal of his contract.

37     In the same vein, the plaintiff's assertion in his AEIC that the Company would have offered him re-contracts until the age of 75 years contradicted the First Letter. As such, minimal weight should be accorded to the plaintiff's assertion.

38     In regard to the quantum for LEC, the defendants compared the plaintiff’s case specifically to that of _Ting Heng Mee v Sin Sheng Fresh Fruits_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGHC 43</span>. In _Ting Heng Mee_, the court had found that the plaintiff had wished to work until the age of 80 – this was five years more than the plaintiff in the present case. The DR’s award of $10,000 was more than reasonable, taking into account the plaintiff’s advanced age of 70 years and the lack of medical opinion that he was totally incapacitated from working or would have difficulty obtaining alternative employment.

### My decision

#### Admissibility of the ex-employer’s letters, findings of fact

39     The plaintiff had taken issue with the manner in which the DR had treated the two letters from the Company, giving weight to the First Letter and disregarding the Second Letter which was a crucial piece of evidence in the plaintiff’s claim for LFE. From the plaintiff’s further submissions for the appeal, it now appears that he no longer seeks to rely on the letters on the basis that they are hearsay and are inadmissible under the exceptions in s 32(1) of the EA[^16].

40     It seems to me that this concession by the plaintiff that the letters should be disregarded on the basis of hearsay has been made because it is reasonably clear from a proper application of the principles in s 32 of the EA that the court would have to exclude the Second Letter while according due weight to the First Letter. This was in fact the position taken by the learned DR.

41     Since the plaintiff is now asking the court to disregard the two letters, I need not deal with the issue of their admissibility. I would however make the following observations with regard to the procedural irregularities that I have observed in the conduct of this case which I find to be unsatisfactory. The burden is on the plaintiff to prove his case on a balance of probabilities. The two letters from the Company were obviously contradictory but there was no affidavit procured from the Company’s director or representative to explain its position on the continued employment, or otherwise, of the plaintiff. The plaintiff’s AEIC in fact conveniently makes no mention of the First Letter which, if admitted in evidence, would clearly undermine his case for LFE. At the point of filing the plaintiff’s AEIC, if he was going to rely on the hearsay evidence in the two letters without calling the makers, the onus was on the plaintiff to comply with the notice requirement as stated in s 32(4)(b) of the EA read with O 38 r 4 of the Rules of Court regardless of whether any objection was raised by the defendants. While the procedure for notice of objections set out in the Practice Directions serves to inform the court and the opponent of the issues raised on the contents of AEICs, the duty remains on the party seeking to adduce evidence to prove the facts in its case to ensure compliance with the EA. All the arguments made in the appeal before me as to the admissibility of the two letters from the Company could have been obviated if the provisions of the EA and the Rules of Court had been complied with.

42     Notwithstanding the plaintiff’s position that the two letters exhibited in his affidavit are hearsay evidence and should be disregarded, as I am entitled to exercise my discretion unfettered by the decision of the learned DR and since both parties have expended considerable effort to put up submissions on this point, I should state my views as follows:

> (a)     The statements in the two letters from the Company are _prima facie_ inadmissible as they are clearly hearsay. This is so despite their inclusion in an agreed bundle of documents, see _Jet Holding Ltd and Others v Cooper Cameron (Singapore) Pte Ltd and Other Appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 3 SLR(R) 769</span> at \[44\], where the scope of agreement was as to authenticity only. The plaintiff still has to prove the contents of the letters in accordance with the EA.

> (b)     The defendants ought to have complied with the order of court made on the directions given under O 37 r 1 and filed their notice of objections to the contents of the plaintiff’s AEIC so that the hearsay objection could have been properly addressed at, or before, the assessment hearing.

> (c)     Since the plaintiff had failed to give notice to admit hearsay under O 38 r 4 of the Rules of Court read with s 34 of the EA, the two letters should be disregarded.

> (d)     Even if the court were to exercise its discretion to cure the non- compliance with O 38 r 4, it is reasonably clear that the defendants would be prejudiced if the court were to admit only the Second Letter which was relied on by the plaintiff in his AEIC. See _Gimpex_ at \[137\] to \[139\].

> (e)     Hence, if the court were to waive the non-compliance with O 38 r 4, both letters from the Company which the plaintiff has exhibited in his AEIC should be admitted and considered. In such a situation, the probative value of the First Letter is clearly greater, it having been issued to the plaintiff contemporaneously at the time of the expiry of the plaintiff’s re-employment contract. The circumstances for the issuance of the Second Letter have not been explained and being clearly contradictory to the First Letter in terms of the plaintiff’s continued employment with the Company, the court should accord minimal weight, if at all, to the Second Letter.

43     Disregarding the two letters and focusing only on the unchallenged averments in the plaintiff’s AEIC, the findings that I would make with regard to the plaintiff’s claim for LEC are as follows:

> (a)     The plaintiff had been employed by the Company since 1993. He was a good and valued employee, having worked there for 23 years. He was re-employed after reaching the retirement age of 65 years and he would have continued working for the Company as long as he remained healthy up to the age of 75 years.

> (b)     The plaintiff’s injuries from the accident have resulted in permanent residual disabilities which affect his employability especially in a position similar to what he had with the Company. He would face difficulties in any manual job that would require any prolonged standing or weight bearing. This is well supported by the unequivocal and unchallenged medical evidence.

> (c)     The plaintiff would be hampered in the job market by his disabilities. At the time of his accident, he was earning a monthly income of $4,270 comprising a basic salary of $3,280, an allowance of $600 and average overtime pay of $390.

#### Determining quantum - the law on LEC

44     Before dealing with the appropriate quantum, it would be apposite to first set out the legal principles governing an award for LEC. Since the plaintiff here has been unemployed since the accident, I find that the dicta of the Court of Appeal in _Mykytovich, Pamela Jane v VIP Hotel_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 829</span> (“_Mykytovich”_) at \[139\] to \[141\] set out below provide valuable guidance:

> _Loss of future earning capacity_

> 139    … Although the Appellant was unemployed at the time of the assessment of damages hearing and likewise at the time this appeal was heard, this does not bar us from granting an award for loss of future earning capacity (see Williams Norris QC _et al_, _Kemp & Kemp: The Quantum of Damages (Volume 1)_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 2016) at para 10.026.1, _Ng Chee Wee v Tan Chin Seng_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGHC 54</span> at \[68\], citing _A v The National Blood Authority_ \[2001\] 3 All ER 289 (“_The National Blood Authority_”), and _Cook v Consolidated Fisheries Ltd_ \[1977\] ICR 635). **_Where the plaintiff is unemployed at the time of the assessment of damages hearing, the test to be applied in determining whether to make any award for loss of future earning capacity is whether there is a real risk that the plaintiff will be at a disadvantage in the open employment market because of the injury sustained in the accident_**_._ This stands in contrast to the two-stage approach adopted in cases involving a plaintiff who is employed at the time damages are assessed, where the court would first ascertain the likelihood of the plaintiff losing his current employment before considering the extent of his economic handicap in the open employment market.

> 140    As emphasised by this court in _Teo Sing Keng v Sim Ban Kiat_ <span class="citation">\[1994\] 1 SLR(R) 340</span> and, more recently, _Chai Kang Wei Samuel v Shaw Linda Gillian_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 3 SLR 587</span> (“_Chai Kang Wei_”) and _Lee Wei Kong v Ng Siok Tong_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 2 SLR 85</span>, awards for loss of future earnings and awards for loss of future earning capacity are distinct types of awards. **_An award for loss of future earning capacity is not an alternative award that is made when a plaintiff lacks sufficient evidence to prove his loss of future earnings (see Chai Kang Wei at \[17\]–\[22\]). Instead, these two types of awards are meant to compensate for different kinds of loss. An award for loss of future earning capacity is given as part of_** **general** **_damages in order to compensate a plaintiff for the weakening of his competitive position in the open labour market_** (see _Smith v Manchester Corporation_ \[1974\] 17 KIR 1 (“_Smith_”) at 8), whereas an award for loss of future earnings is a form of _special_ damages awarded for real assessable loss proved by evidence (see _Fairley v John Thompson (Design and Contracting Division) Ltd_ \[1973\] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 40 at 42). Whether the court will: (a) grant both types of awards; (b) grant an award for loss of future earning capacity while refusing to grant an award for loss of future earnings; or (c) _vice versa_ is dependent on and determined by the evidence before the court (see _Chai Kang Wei_ at \[21\]).

> 141     **_In making awards for loss of future earning capacity, it is not appropriate to use any of the formulas commonly employed to calculate awards for loss of future earnings, such as the multiplicand and multiplier method_** _(see Chai Kang Wei at \[15\], citing Moeliker v A Reyrolle & Co Ltd_ \[1977\] 1 All ER 9 (“Moeliker”)). **_Instead, the court should award a global sum after taking into account all the factors which are relevant to the particular case at hand,_****eg****_, the plaintiff’s age, his skills, the nature of his disability, whether he is capable of undertaking only one type of work or whether he is capable of undertaking other types of work as well_** (see _Moeliker_ at 141–142). As Judith Prakash J observed in _Clark Jonathan Michael v Lee Khee Chung_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 1 SLR 209</span> (“_Clark Jonathan Michael_”) at \[91\], an assessment of damages for loss of future earning capacity can be an exercise in speculation as the court often does not know the extent to which a plaintiff will be disadvantaged in the open employment market by his disabilities if he has to seek a new position. **_The court must take a “rough and ready” approach_** _(see Clark Jonathan Michael at \[91\])_ **_and calculate the loss of earning capacity “in the round”_** _(see Smith at 8)_, **_ultimately arriving at a figure that it considers reasonable in the particular circumstances to compensate the particular plaintiff for the disadvantage which he faces in the open employment market due to his disabilities_** (see also _The National Blood Authority _at \[58\]).

(emphasis in **_bold italics_** mine)

45     It is also accepted that crossing the legal retirement age is not a bar to an award of LEC. As stated by the High Court in _Lee Mui Yeng v Ng Tong Yoo_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 46</span>, the key question is whether there is evidence that the plaintiff would have continued to be in active employment despite having crossed the legal retirement age. If the plaintiff intends to continue working, and a risk of not being able to do so is there because of the injuries suffered, there is a justifiable basis for awarding damages for LEC.  However, in assessing the quantum to be awarded, the plaintiff’s age and the salary of the job at risk would be relevant considerations. It would also be relevant to assess the re-employability of the plaintiff based on his/her skills and qualifications.

#### My decision on the quantum of LEC

46     I note that the DR had stated that he was constrained by case precedents, and had made his award by reference to four cases where the plaintiffs were also of advanced age. While the cases relied on are helpful, it is trite, as submitted by the plaintiff, that each case must be decided on its own facts. The case precedents would provide some limited guidance where parallels may be drawn between the present case and the case precedents. What is clear is that the inquiry must be specific to the facts of the case at hand, and the court must have regard to all the circumstances including the plaintiff’s age and qualifications, his remaining length of working life, and the nature of his disabilities, as explained in _Moeliker._

47     The challenge in determining the quantum for LEC is that while we have cases of the highest authority which instruct that it is inappropriate to use the formulas commonly employed to calculate awards for LFE such as the multiplicand/multiplier method (as in _Mykytovich_) there are also cases which have expressly used the multiplicand/multiplier to derive an LEC award. Unfortunately, the cases in the latter category such as _Kenneth Quek_ have not provided any principles or guidance as to how the multiplicand/multiplier methodology ought to be applied in the assessment of LEC which is to compensate for the disadvantage suffered by a plaintiff in the open employment market.

48     The position in England appears to be similar – counsel for the plaintiff had referred to _Kemp & Kemp_ where the editors have similarly commented that the multiplicand/multiplier method has been employed in various English cases in calculating S&M damages, and that there is “no flaw in that method or approach”. While a rough guide of between six months and five years’ loss of the claimant’s present net annual salary was suggested, there is no explication as to how these figures are derived.

49     Further, while the multiplicand/multiplier approach was adopted in _Kenneth Quek_, the multiplicand of $750 per month used by the court does not seem to have any nexus to his estimated earnings prior to his accident based on his chequered employment record adduced to the court, or to the jobs that he said he might be suited for. There is no explanation as to how the multiplicand figure was derived (see _Kenneth Quek_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 96</span> at \[88\] to \[91\]). Although the plaintiff had adduced salary benchmarks from the Singapore Workforce Development Agency as well as the Ministry of Manpower for occupations that might have been suitable for the plaintiff, it is not discernible whether the statistics were considered in coming up with the multiplicand for LEC.

50     In another recent case where the multiplicand/multiplier approach was relied on as a checking mechanism for the award of LEC, the multiplicand used by the Court of Appeal was pegged at half of the percentage permanent incapacity (of 14%) that the medical expert had recommended, based on the Guide to the Assessment of Traumatic Injuries and Occupation Diseases for Workmen’s Compensation, which was thought to be an appropriate figure. See _Yap Boon Fong Yvonne v Wong Kok Mun Alvin and Another_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGCA 80</span> at \[72\] to \[73\]. The basis for relying on a fraction of the permanent incapacity found is also not clear.

51     I would accordingly decline to use the multiplicand/multiplier method to determine LEC in this case. Further, it seems to me that by adopting the calculation submitted by the plaintiff which is for two years’ loss of earnings, this appears to conflate an LEC award with LFE. This should not be the case especially when there is no evidence adduced, and no finding made, that the plaintiff would have continued working for the Company until the age of 75 years but for the accident.

52     Ultimately, the LEC award has to be a figure that the court considers reasonable and appropriate to compensate this particular plaintiff in the particular circumstances of his case for the disadvantage which he faces in the open employment market due to his disabilities. As the unchallenged evidence of the plaintiff is that he would continue working up to the age of 75 years, this means that he has another five years of being in the open employment market. While there is no evidence as to what kind of jobs he would be suited for, considering the amounts he had previously earned, his previous occupation as a supervisor in a physically demanding role, and his residual disabilities which would handicap him in jobs that would require prolonged standing, I would increase the DR’s award of $10,000 for LEC to $15,000.

53     By way of a comparison with decided cases to ensure some parity, I would use the case of _Ting Heng Mee_ referred to by the DR where the plaintiff was 70 years old at the time of assessment and it was found that he had another 10 years of working life left. At the time of the accident, he was working as a barber earning about $700 per month. As a result of his injuries, he was unable to use his hands for strength and precision work. The court had awarded $2,500 for LEC. He was also unemployed at the time of trial. The plaintiff in the present case was earning a monthly income of $4,270 which is about six times that of _Ting Heng Mee_. Considering that they are both in the same age group and suffer disabilities which affect their competitiveness for physically demanding jobs, the plaintiff’s compensation for LEC should, in my view, be at least six times that of the award in _Ting Heng Mee_. This works out to $15,000.

54     Going about it another way, _Ting Heng Mee_ received an LEC award which represented about 31/2 months of his salary. The LEC of $15,000 which is my award for the plaintiff is approximately 3.5 times of his monthly income ($4,270 x 3 = $14,945) rounded up. Admittedly, this is a rough and ready approach for calculating LEC in the round, and entails a significant degree of speculation. Based on the current law and the evidence adduced, this is the best the court can do in the circumstances.

55     Accordingly, the DR’s award for LEC is varied to $15,000.

## Costs

### Plaintiff’s submissions

56     The plaintiff argued that the sum of $18,000 awarded by the DR as costs for the entire action was inadequate based on the final amount of damages awarded and the work done. The total quantum as assessed by the DR was $83,037.27 as damages and interest of approximately $12,064.02, making a total award of $95,000.00. The issue of liability was contested and took up one full day of trial and two half-days for submissions. The assessment hearing occupied three half-days. There were numerous court attendances for pre-trial conferences (“PTCs”), court dispute resolution (“CDRs”) sessions as well as assessment of damages CDR sessions (“AD-CDRs) – 10 CDR sessions, three PTCs, 10 AD-CDR sessions, and three AEICs prepared/considered. It was submitted that the costs awarded in the present case should be increased to $35,000.

57     As comparison, the plaintiff relied on the following two district court cases where much higher costs awards were given:

> (a)     DC/DC 1741/2015, _Yuliya Er Hsin Nih v Li Guofu_

> Particulars of case:

> Total damages: $400,000 with $223,000 being medical expenses.

> No trial, 12 CDR and eight AD-CDR sessions, three AEICs filed. 2 half-day tranches of assessment of damages.

> Costs awarded: $45,000 on 25 February 2019.

> (b)     DC/DC 1805/2015, _Eugene Benitez v Po Teck Po_

> Particulars of case:

> Total damages: $81,019.22.

> No trial, 2 CDR and 16 AD-CDR sessions, 4 AD-PTCs and 6 half-day tranches of assessment of damages.

> Costs awarded: $19,000 by the District Court which was increased to $25,000 on appeal to High Court on 13 March 2019.

### Defendants’ submissions

58     Counsel for the defendants submitted as follows:

> (a)     The trial on liability lasted one day during which the plaintiff and the second defendant gave evidence. The issue on liability was not complicated. The assessment of damages took place over two half-days without witnesses being called, and centred purely on legal submissions on the LFE and LEC issues. Most of the plaintiff's heads of claims were resolved and the disputed claim for LFE was dismissed.

> (b)     The final judgment sum of $83,037.27 is slightly above the Magistrate’s Court limit of $60,000 for which the scale costs in the O 59 Appendix 2 Part IV of the Rules of Court provide for a range of $5,000 to $18,000.

> (c)     The costs guidelines in the Supreme Court Practice Directions Appendix G set a daily tariff for a one-day motor accident trial and assessment of damages hearing at $10,000 and $5,000 respectively.

> (d)     Accordingly, the DR’s costs award of $18,000 was reasonable. There was no error of law, and no reason to disturb the DR's exercise of discretion on costs.

### My decision

59     From my perusal of the record in these proceedings, I agree with the defendants’ submissions. The liability trial concluded within a day. While there were three sets of written submissions, the issues were not particularly complicated.

60     As for the assessment of damages, there were no complex injuries. There was no examination of witnesses. The hearings were relatively short and the only contested issue was the claim for LFE which did not succeed, and submissions were then furnished to the DR for the LEC claim. In contrast, the second case that was referred to by counsel for the plaintiff, DC/DC 1741/2015 – _Eugene Benitez v Po Teck Po_, an appeal which I had also presided as the district judge in chambers, involved the examination of several medical experts. The issues were far more complex than those in the present case. For the first case – DC/DC 1741/2015, _Yuliya Er Hsin Nih v Li Guofu_, the size of the award at $400,000 is far greater than that in this case and is not a suitable comparison.

61     All considered, the DR’s award of $18,000 for costs was fair and reasonable. I see no basis to disturb it and the costs award is affirmed.

## Conclusion

62     In conclusion, the appeal is partially allowed. The DR’s decision is varied with an upward adjustment of LEC to $15,000. The appeal against the DR’s award of costs is dismissed.

63     As for costs of the appeal, parties are to write in within 14 days from the date of this judgment for a hearing on costs if they are unable to agree.
