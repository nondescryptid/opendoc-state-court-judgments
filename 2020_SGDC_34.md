7 February 2020

### District Judge Clement Julien Tan Tze Ming:

1       This Disposal Inquiry (“DI”) was commenced pursuant to Section 370 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68). There were two claimants in this DI – Chen Xiuzhu (“C1”) and Abhinav Sethi (“C2”). At stake was the sum of S$5,500 held in C1’s bank account. At the end of the DI hearing, I lifted the freeze on C1’s bank account and ordered the return of the sum of S$5,500 to C2. Dissatisfied, C1 filed a Magistrate’s Appeal against the orders made.

2       The circumstances leading up to the commencement of the DI are as follows. On 12 January 2019, C2 was waiting for his flight from Melbourne to Singapore when he received a message on Facebook Messenger from his friend and former colleague, one Ankit Jaiswal (“Ankit”). Ankit explained that he had just moved to Australia and urgently needed to transfer money to a DBS/POSB account but could not do so as he did not have the DBS physical token with him. Ankit wanted to know if C2 could put him in touch with someone working in DBS to assist him in this regard. Believing that his friend’s situation was urgent, C2 offered to transfer the money on Ankit’s behalf, and for Ankit to repay him later. Ankit expressed some tentativeness initially, but eventually accepted C2’s offer. C2 then proceeded to transfer the sum of S$5,500 in accordance with the instructions provided by Ankit. As requested, C2 also sent a screenshot of the transaction to Ankit.

3       Unbeknownst to C2, Ankit’s Facebook account had been hacked and the person C2 had been exchanging messages with was, in fact, not Ankit. C2 realised this several hours later when Ankit, this being his actual friend, called to inform C2 about his hacked account and to check if anyone had tried to contact C2 using the account. As soon as C2 registered what was going on, he immediately notified DBS bank and lodged a police report in respect of the fraud. The bank account belonging to C1, to which C2 had transferred the money, was then frozen.

4       At the same time that C2 was communicating with the fraudster, C1 was contacted by an account-holder (“X”) on the online marketplace platform, Carousell. X wanted to exchange S$5,500 for Chinese RMB, to which C1 agreed. C1 provided her bank account details to X. She requested to see proof of the transfer of funds to her bank account before she performed her side of the remittance transaction. C1 subsequently received a screenshot showing the transfer of S$5,500 to her bank account. Satisfied that she had received the funds, she then instructed her nephew in China to transfer the Chinese RMB amount (equivalent to S$5,500) to the bank account stipulated by X. C1’s nephew duly carried out the transfer and sent her a screenshot of the RMB transaction. C1 forwarded this screenshot to X.

5       In the course of the Commercial Affairs Department’s (“CAD”) investigations, it transpired that X’s Carousell account was hacked as well, presumably by the same person(s) who had hacked into Ankit’s Facebook account. Unfortunately, despite their best efforts, CAD was unable to track down the perpetrator(s) of the scam. Unable to proceed further with the case, CAD applied for this DI hearing to dispose of the seized funds.

6       It was clear to me that C1 and C2 were victims of an elaborate scam. This appeared to be the conclusion reached by the CAD, and there was no evidence to suggest otherwise. C1 repeatedly claimed that C2 was one of the perpetrators of the scam. However, I find that to be a baseless allegation. As an aside, C1’s conduct in these proceedings left much to be desired. Not only did she raise spurious allegations against C2, she also castigated the CAD for their failure in tracking down the perpetrators of the scam. Numerous attempts were made to explain to C1 the manner in which the scam was perpetrated and the challenges faced by the CAD. However, C1 was, obstinately and obtusely, adamant that she was the only victim in this case and refused to accept any explanations. Her position was that she should be entitled to the full sum of S$5,500 and repeatedly rebuffed C2’s overtures to resolve the case amicably by splitting the seized funds.

7       Having considered the matter, I ordered the return of the sum of S$5,500 to C2 for two reasons.

8       First, I was satisfied as to C2’s entitlement to the seized funds. He produced a copy of his bank statement and a screenshot of the transaction evidencing the transfer of S$5,500 from his bank account to C1’s bank account on 12 January 2019. The CAD investigating officer, Staff Sergeant Alex Ng Puay Howe, also testified that there were no other deposits into or withdrawals from C1’s bank account after the S$5,500 was transferred. In my view, the transfer was undoubtedly procured by fraud or at least, by mistake, thereby making C1 a constructive trustee of the funds. That C2 would be able to trace his interest, whether at law or in equity, into the $5,500 held in C1’s bank account is, in my view, also undeniable. Put simply, the S$5,500 earmarked and frozen in C1’s bank account clearly came from C2 and, barring other claims, he is entitled to have the funds returned to him.

9       On the contrary, C1 failed to demonstrate or articulate the basis upon which her claim rests. Granted, she had instructed her nephew to transfer the RMB equivalent only upon being satisfied that the S$5,500 had been deposited in her bank account. However, I do not think that alone is sufficient to ground a proprietary interest or claim to the seized funds. This is not even a situation involving a commingling of funds where she might still be able to eke out some interest in the same. If there is any recourse available to C1, it must lie elsewhere.

10     Second, I had misgivings as to C1’s standing as a claimant in these proceedings. C1 may be an interested party given that her bank account was frozen. However, since C1’s nephew transferred the RMB equivalent to the fraudster, he would appear to be the proper claimant to the seized funds. In this regard, C1 sought to explain that she had entered into a loan arrangement with her nephew when she asked him to transfer the RMB equivalent to the fraudster on 12 January 2019. C1 claimed that she subsequently withdrew the sum of S$8,300 from another bank account on 15 January 2019. From this amount, she handed over S$5,500 in cash to her husband’s friend whom she referred to as “David”. David was, in turn, to hand this cash to C1’s nephew in China and, purportedly, did so on 2 February 2019. As such, C1 contended that she had repaid the loan and is now entitled to make a claim for the seized funds.

11     To corroborate her account, C1 tendered a document consisting of the front and back of what she claimed were copies of her nephew’s Communist Party of China identification card, and some handwritten Chinese characters. C1 testified that this was a signed declaration by her nephew that he had received the sum of S$5,500 on 2 February 2019 from C1’s friend. C1 also tendered what appeared to be a screenshot of a transaction for the cash withdrawal of S$8,300 on 15 January 2019.

12     I found that there were many gaps in C1’s account. When questioned, C1 was unable to provide details regarding the handing of the cash to David. For example, she was unable to say when or where she handed the cash to David. She did not even know who David was or whether this was his real name, save that David was her husband’s friend. It was also unclear why she returned the money to her nephew in SGD rather than in RMB since C1’s nephew transferred the sum of RMB 27,115 to the fraudster. C1’s nephew and David could have addressed some of the issues raised but unfortunately, neither was called by C1 to give evidence in these proceedings. C1 also did not adduce any messages either with her nephew or with David. The provenance of the purported signed declaration appeared dubious. Without any objective corroborative evidence, the cash withdrawal of $8,300 on 15 January 2019 appeared all too convenient. As such, I was of the view that C1 had not substantiated her claim.

13     In any event, even if C1 did repay the loan to her nephew, this would still not give her any proprietary rights or claim to the seized funds, as already explained above.
