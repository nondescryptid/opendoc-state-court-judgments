Damages – Rules in awarding

15 September 2022

### District Judge Jill Tan Li Ching:

1       This was a Registrar’s Appeal against the decision of the Deputy Registrar (“**DR**”) concerning the award of damages to the victim of a road traffic accident. The appeal raised the question of whether an accident victim who had a substantial portion of her medical expenses covered by government subsidies could nevertheless claim for the subsidised amounts against the tortfeasor, on the ground that the receipt of such government subsidies should be recognised as a new exception to the general rule against double recovery. The appellant asked this court to answer this question in the affirmative, based on a pronouncement by Justice of the Appellate Division Belinda Ang in _Noor Azlin bin Abdul Rahman and another v Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 10</span> (“**_Noor Azlin (HC)_**”). I answered the question in the negative, affirmed the DR’s decision, and dismissed the appeal. These are the grounds of my decision.

2       Before considering the ambit of the pronouncement by Ang JAD and the question posed in the appeal, I noted the undisputed facts and applicable legal principles.

## Facts

3       On 9 January 2020, the appellant, aged 81, was crossing a road when she was hit by a vehicle driven by the respondent. She was hospitalised for the injuries she suffered, the most serious of which was a right ankle trimalleolar closed fracture.

4       Her lawsuit against the respondent claiming for general and special damages on account of his negligence was filed in June 2020. In May 2021, interlocutory judgment was entered against the respondent by consent for 85% of the damages to be assessed. After the assessment of damages hearing, the DR awarded damages totalling $36,348.64. The general damages awarded for pain and suffering were $18,600, while the special damages were for medical expenses, transport expenses, and medical apparatus. Under the head of medical expenses, the DR awarded $411.30 for amounts paid by the appellant in cash, $5,834.92 for amounts paid through her Medisave account, and $11,221.63 for amounts paid through Medishield payouts.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) In doing so, the DR declined to grant a claim for $39,515.08, which comprised government subsidies and grants. These were:

> (a)     Generic government subsidies of $19,211.57;

> (b)     Pioneer Generation (“**PG**”) subsidies of $148.88; and

> (c)     Government grants for Community Hospital Services and medical drugs (“**community grants**”), of $20,155.16.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2)

5       The appeal was only against the decision on these three items, hereinafter referred to collectively as “**Subsidies and Grants**”.

## Applicable Legal Principles

6       The relevant case law and general principles were not disputed by parties. It was on the application of the principles that they disagreed.

7       The starting point was the general rule that a victim cannot recover more by way of damages than the amount of her actual loss. Damages are thus compensatory and seek to put the victim in the same position as far as possible, as if the tort had not been committed. Put another way, _prima facie_, the only loss recoverable is the victim’s net loss. Thus, in _The “MARA”_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 3 SLR(R) 31</span> at \[26\], the Court of Appeal held that:

> “The basic rule is that damages in negligence are purely compensatory, and in assessing damages for the loss the injured plaintiff has sustained, any gain which is received by him, which he would not have but for the injury, _prima facie_ will be taken into account. In _Hussain v New Taplow Paper Mills Ltd_ \[1998\] AC 514 at 527, Lord Bridge of Harwich said:

>> \[P\]rima facie the only recoverable loss is the net loss….””

8       In the same vein, the High Court held in _Lo Lee Len v Grand Interior Renovation Works Pte Ltd and others_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 2 SLR(R) 1</span> (“**_Lo Lee Len_**”) at \[12\] as follows:

> “The object of an award of damages is to place the injured party as nearly as possible in the same financial position as he would have been in but for the accident. The basic rule is that the \[injured party\] cannot recover more by way of damages than the amount of his actual loss. If a collateral benefit compensates for the same loss, it must be taken into account in determining the actual level of compensation required through an award of damages. The consideration here is about the deduction of compensation advantages or benefits which a plaintiff enjoyed as a result of the breach.”

9       This has been referred to as the rule against double recovery, or the doctrine of collateral benefits, and either expression may be used herein as the context requires.

10     However, there are two well-established exceptions to this general rule – they were referred to by the DR in his Grounds of Decision (“DR’s GD”) as the “insurance exception” and the “benevolence exception”, and I adopted the same terminology.

> (a)     The insurance exception applies where a plaintiff recovers any moneys under an insurance policy for which he has paid the premiums – in that case, the insurance moneys are not deductible from damages payable by the tortfeasor (see _The “MARA”_ at \[28\], from _Bradburn v GreatWestern Rly Co_ (1874) LR 10 Exch 1, as affirmed in _Minichit Bunhom v Jazali bin Kastari_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 1037</span> (“**_Minichit Bunhom_**”) at \[84\]).

> (b)     The benevolence exception applies where the plaintiff receives money or charitable gifts from the benevolence of third parties prompted by sympathy for his misfortune, as in the case of a beneficiary from a disaster fund – the amount received is similarly not deductible from damages payable by the tortfeasor (see _The “MARA”_ at \[28\], from _Redpath v Belfast and County Down Railway_ \[1947\] NI 167, as affirmed in _Minichit Bunhom_ at \[84\]; see also _Lo Lee Len_ at \[12\]).

11     On this point, our courts have had regard to the pronouncements by the High Court of Australia in _National Insurance Co of New Zealand Ltd v Espagne_ (1961) 105 CLR 569 (“**_Espagne_**”). As noted by the Court of Appeal in _The “MARA”_ at \[32\], Dixon CJ stated in _Espagne_ that:

> “There are certain **special services, aids, benefits, subventions and the like which in most communities are available to injured people**. Simple examples are **hospital and pharmaceutical benefits which lighten the monetary burden of illness. If the injured plaintiff has availed himself of these, he cannot establish or calculate his damages on the footing that he did not do so**. On the other hand there may be advantages which accrue to the injured plaintiff, whether as a result of legislation or of a contract or of benevolence, which have an **additional characteristic**… namely ... they are a **product of a disposition in his favour intended for his enjoyment and not provided in relief of any liability in others fully to compensate him**.” (emphases added)

12     Similarly, Widmeyer J stated in _Espagne_ that:

> “In assessing damages for personal injuries, benefits that a plaintiff has received or is to receive from any source other than the defendant are not to be regarded as mitigating his loss, if: (a) they were received or are to be received by him as a result of a contract he had made before the loss occurred and by the express or implied terms of that contract they were to be provided notwithstanding any rights of action he might have; or (b) they were given or promised to him by way of bounty, to the intent that he should enjoy them in addition to and not in diminution of any claim for damages. The first description covers accident insurances and also many forms of pensions and similar benefits provided by employers … The second description covers a variety of public charitable aid and **some** forms of relief given by the State as well as the produce of private benevolence. **In both cases the decisive consideration is**, not whether the benefit was received in consequence of, or as a result of the injury, but **what was its character**: and that is determined, in the one case by what under his contract the plaintiff had paid for, and in the other by the intent of the person conferring the benefit. **The test is by purpose rather than by cause**.” (emphases added)

13     The Court of Appeal in _Minichit Bunhom_ (at \[83\]), citing _McGregor on Damages_, also noted that moneys paid out under an insurance policy are generally not deductible from the plaintiff’s claim because “even if in the result the \[plaintiff\] may be compensated beyond his loss, he has paid for the accident insurance with his own moneys, and the fruits of this thrift and foresight should in fairness enure to his and not to the defendant’s advantage”.

14     Thus, the principles underlying these exceptions to the general rule against double recovery may be summarised as follows:

> (a)     In the insurance exception, the plaintiff has paid his premiums under his insurance contract, and if he is entitled to his payout independently of any compensation he might receive from the tortfeasor, then it will not go towards reducing the amount he can claim from the tortfeasor. This means that even though the plaintiff may be compensated beyond his loss, he should not be deprived of this advantage, since he has paid for the accident insurance with his own money and should reap the fruits of his thrift and foresight.

> (b)     In the benevolence exception, the money was given with a charitable intent and was meant for the plaintiff’s retention, so it also should not go towards reducing the amount he can claim from the tortfeasor.

> (c)     Where a plaintiff receives money for his injury which was intended for his enjoyment and was not provided to relieve the tortfeasor of liability to compensate him, then that money need not be deducted from the amount he can claim against the tortfeasor. In other words, if the plaintiff receives money by way of general aid, subventions, or hospital benefits, that do not have such an **additional characteristic**, then the receipt of money does not fall under the existing exceptions and must be deducted from the amount he can claim. In short, it is the **character and the purpose** of that payment that will determine whether it constitutes an exception to the rule against double recovery and is a collateral benefit that the plaintiff can retain.

15     The DR rejected the appellant’s claim for the Subsidies and Grants essentially because he found that they could not be considered in the nature of insurance payouts such that they fell within the insurance exception, or benevolent payments of the sort contemplated by the benevolence exception.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) Counsel for the appellant Ms VM Vidthiya contended that the DR had misunderstood the appellant’s case in trying to fit the scenario within the existing exceptions; her argument was that the Subsidies and Grants “ought to be considered as another exception to the double recovery rule.”[^4]

16     In this regard, the Court of Appeal accepted in _The “MARA”_ at \[29\] that the categories of exceptions are not closed, and:

> “…there are circumstances where payments made to the injured plaintiffs do not fall precisely and squarely within either of the exceptions but are nonetheless not deductible in the assessment of recoverable loss. It should be borne in mind that the distinction between what is deductible and what is not is at times certainly not clear cut, and in between them are borderline cases which essentially turn on the special facts.”

The Court of Appeal then again cited Lord Bridge in _Hussain v New Taplow Paper Mills Ltd_ \[1998\] AC 514 at 527, who noted that many common law judges have been “baffled by the problem of how to articulate a single guiding rule to distinguish receipts by a plaintiff which are to be taken into account in mitigation of damage from those which are not.” Lord Bridge then noted that Lord Reid in _Parry v Cleaver_ <span class="citation">\[1970\] AC 1</span>, at 13H, summed up the matter thus, “The common law has treated this matter as one depending on **justice, reasonableness and public policy**.” (emphasis added)

## Appellant’s Arguments

17     With these basic points in mind, I turned to the pronouncement made by Ang JAD in _Noor Azlin (HC)_ at \[212\] to \[214\]. The pronouncement was made in the context of whether the plaintiff could claim against the defendant for medical expenses which had been covered by her insurance policies, the Medication Assistance Fund (“**MAF**”), and the National Cancer Centre’s MediFund (see _Noor Azlin (HC)_ at \[210\]). After noting that the contractual relationship between the insurer and the plaintiff was the basis for insurance payouts being an exception to the rule against double recovery, Ang JAD went on to state that:

> “213  The same reasoning applies to government subsidies. Subsidies are provided by the government to its citizens or residents due to the government’s relationship with its people. Such subsidies are awarded for a multitude of public policy reasons, such as the betterment of public health or access to affordable healthcare for citizens who qualify for assistance.

> 214    The Court of Appeal in _The “MARA”_ at \[32\] endorsed Windeyer J’s dicta in _Espagne_ that relief given by the state should also be an exception to the rule against double recovery. Therefore, the fact that \[the plaintiff’s\] medical expenses were paid by her insurance or government subsidies does not prevent her from claiming for compensation for these medical expenses from the tortfeasor.”

18     Ms Vidthiya’s main arguments in submitting that this court should allow the appellant’s claims for the Subsidies and Grants were as follows:

> (a)     First, she relied on Ang JAD’s pronouncement that “relief given by the state should also be an exception to the rule against double recovery”, and on the fact that Ang JAD allowed the claim in _Noor Azlin (HC)_ although the plaintiff had not paid the medical expenses from her own pocket.[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5)

> In this regard, Ms Vidthiya submitted that Ang JAD “explained” that government subsidies fall within the benevolence exception, “**and/or** that government subsidies satisfied the purpose test because the character of the subsidy and the intent of the government conferring the benefit is established due to the government’s relationship with the citizens or residents.”

> Since the Subsidies and Grants were specifically given to the appellant due to her eligibility, they were “intended for \[her\] enjoyment and not provided in relief of any liability in others to fully compensate \[her\].” Put another way, the appellant as a citizen had paid her taxes and the Government had granted citizens subsidies as a result. Since the citizen was entitled to this subsidy due to her status or age, there was a relationship between the Government as the giver and her as the recipient of the subsidy. The Subsidies and Grants thus bore the “additional characteristic” referred to in _Espagne_.[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6)

> (b)     Second, Ms Vidthiya contended that it could not have been the Parliamentary intent to allow tortfeasors to benefit from the subsidies granted to eligible patients.

> In this regard, since s 22 of the Pioneer Generation and Merdeka Generation Funds Act 2014 (“**Pioneer Act**”) allowed overpaid sums or sums paid in error to be clawed back, Parliament’s intent must have been for only eligible persons to receive the said subsidies. By extension, Parliament could not have intended for tortfeasors to benefit from such subsidies by having their liability in damages reduced, especially since there was no express mention of such an intent. It would also be contrary to public policy to allow a tortfeasor to benefit from such subsidies.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7)

> Ms Vidthiya then submitted that if the appellant was awarded her claim for the government subsidies, the court could order that she repay the amount to the relevant “ministerial agencies”. In any event, even if she did not or was unable to return the money, it would not be a problem if her receipt thereof was considered an exception to the double recovery rule.[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8)

## Overview of Types of Government Assistance for Healthcare

19     In considering Ms Vidthiya’s arguments, I noted that she used the term “government subsidies” to refer to the Subsidies and Grants in the present case. The same term was used by Ang JAD in _Noor Azlin (HC)_. However, the “government subsidies” that the plaintiff received in that case were from the MAF, MAF Plus, and MediFund. In the present case, the appellant received generic government subsidies, PG subsidies and community grants. To better consider both cases in their respective contexts, I took a step back to better understand these subsidies and schemes.

20     In this regard, Ms Vidthiya agreed that to ascertain the nature and scope of the various government subsidies at play, the court could look to the descriptions given to them in the official Government websites, though she submitted that one could not necessarily ascertain the full intent underlying these subsidies from the website write-ups. Nevertheless, she conceded that the websites would at least provide a useful starting point for the court.

21     The official Singapore Government portal states that there are four “lines of defence” in the Government’s healthcare framework to make healthcare affordable for Singaporeans.

> ·    The first is **subsidies** – hospitalisation, outpatient care and long-term care are heavily subsidised.

> ·    The second is **insurance**, such as Medishield Life and CareShield Life.

> ·    The third is **MediSave**, where money set aside from one’s salary can be used towards payment for surgery, hospitalisation, health screenings and the like.

> ·    The fourth is **safety nets**, such as MediFund and ElderFund. Safety nets are to aid Singaporean patients who still have financial difficulties with their remaining bills after they have availed themselves of the first three types of assistance.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9)

## **_Types of assistance received by Plaintiff in_** Noor Azlin (HC)

22     The MAF is a scheme set up in 2010 that helps patients who face difficulty affording the costs of selected high-cost medications for certain medical conditions, and can assist with up to 75% of the costs of the approved drugs. More expensive drugs (such as cancer treatment drugs) are listed on the MAF and they apply only when prescribed to patients who meet clinical criteria specific to the drug to ensure that their use is cost-effective. The MAF was expanded in 2011 (colloquially referred to as MAF Plus) to cover non-standard drugs if these were assessed to be clinically necessary and appropriate for the patient on a case-by-case basis. A patient wishing to apply for aid under the MAF must approach a medical social worker (“MSW”) at the relevant public hospital, specialist outpatient clinic or polyclinic where she is receiving treatment, for further advice.[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10)

23     MediFund is an endowment fund set up by the Government to help needy Singaporeans who need further help with their remaining bills even after receiving Government subsidies and drawing on other means of payments including MediShield Life, private integrated shield plans, MediSave and cash. The amount of help from MediFund depends on the patient’s financial situation and charges incurred. A patient wishing to apply for this aid must be a Singapore citizen, a subsidised patient, have received or require treatment from a MediFund-approved institution, and be having difficulties paying for her healthcare bills even after receiving subsidies or drawing on other payment methods as mentioned above. As with the MAF, the patient must approach an MSW at the MediFund-approved institution at which she is seeking treatment.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11)

### Types of assistance received by the appellant

24     The bulk of the **generic government subsidies** received by the appellant were found in her inpatient bills from Tan Tock Seng Hospital (“TTSH”) and were referred to simply as “Government Subsidy”. In these inpatient bills, an “Amount Before Govt Subsidy” was listed, with an “Amt Payable” next to it. These covered expenses including the room charge and daily treatment fee in a Class B2 or Class C ward, X-rays, medication, surgery, and therapy.[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12) This “Government Subsidy” also appeared in the TTSH bills for consultations, X-rays and laboratory tests (“consultation bills”).[^13]

25     The **PG subsidies** received by the appellant were found in the same TTSH consultation bills as well as polyclinic bills, and were referred to as “Government Subsidy for Pioneers (additional 50% off)”. [\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14) These subsidies are granted to those born on or before 31 December 1949 and who became Singapore citizens on or before 31 December 1986. They are part of the PG Package introduced by the Government to “honour and thank our pioneers for their hard work and dedication” in building Singapore, and are aimed at making healthcare affordable for them for life. The benefits under the PG Package include MediSave top-ups, outpatient care subsidies, CareShield Life incentives and MediShield Life premium subsidies. To receive subsidies for visits to outpatient clinics, a patient must be assessed and referred by a polyclinic.[^15]

26     The **community grants** received by the appellant were found in the bill from Thye Hwa Kwan Hospital, and were referred to as “Government Grant (Community Hospital Service)” and “Government Grant (Drugs)”.[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16) These community grants are subsidies for Government-funded intermediate and long-term care services, for those who have been discharged from an acute hospital, or need supervision and assistance to manage daily life. To be eligible for this subsidy, a patient must be Singaporean or a permanent resident, meet the admission criteria, be already receiving care from a Ministry of Health (“**MOH**”)-funded service provider, and satisfy a means test.[^17]

### Categorisation of types of assistance received

27     Having reviewed these subsidies and assistance schemes, I placed them within the four “lines of defence” in the Government’s healthcare framework to provide a frame of reference. Thus:

> (a)     The generic government subsidies that the appellant received clearly fell under the first “line of defence” in the Government’s healthcare framework.

> (b)     The PG subsidies that the appellant received also fell under the first “line of defence” as they were generic subsidies for medical bills that applied to all Singaporeans of a certain age group. For completeness, I observed that insofar as some types of financial assistance in the PG Package concerned top-ups for MediSave, CareShield Life incentives and MediShield Life premium subsidies, those were more likely to fall under the second “line of defence” as they related to the Government-driven insurance and savings schemes. However, as those were not in issue in the present case, I make no further comment thereon.

> (c)     Concerning the community grants received by the appellant, they clearly did not fall under the second or third “lines of defence”. Given the generic description given to them in the bill and their classification as subsidies in MOH’s list of Healthcare Schemes and Subsidies, I concluded that they fell under the first “line of defence”.

> (d)     The MediFund assistance received by the plaintiff in _Noor Azlin (HC)_ clearly fell under the fourth “line of defence”.

> (e)     As for the MAF, it was also clear that it did not fall under the second or third “lines of defence”. Since the MAF aid was granted only to patients who met clinical criteria specific to a drug or had a clinical necessity for the drugs, case-by-case assessment was required before the assistance could be granted, and the application had to be made through an MSW, it could be seen that the assistance granted under the scheme was strict, selective and not generic. If so, it was more likely to fall under the fourth “line of defence”, as another safety net or last resort, than under the first “line of defence”, as generic assistance.

## My Decision

## **_Ambit of pronouncement in_** Noor Azlin (HC)

28     Returning to the appellant’s arguments, I dealt first with the ambit of Ang JAD’s pronouncement in _Noor Azlin (HC)_. In this regard, I made three observations.

> (a)     First, given the flow of the text at \[213\] and \[214\] of the judgment, it was not clear whether Ang JAD treated the government subsidies as an extension of the insurance exception (which \[213\] suggested), or whether Her Honour regarded them as coming under the benevolence exception (which \[214\] suggested). Tellingly, in her submissions, Ms Vidthiya also framed Ang JAD’s reasoning in the alternative. As noted above, Ms Vidthiya submitted that Ang JAD “explained” that government subsidies fall within the benevolence exception, “**and/or** that government subsidies satisfied the purpose test because the character of the subsidy and the intent of the government conferring the benefit is established due to the government’s relationship with the citizens or residents.” Insofar as this submission suggested that Ang JAD might have created a new exception for government subsidies, I was wary of making this extrapolation, since Ang JAD was clearly aware of the two existing exceptions (see _Noor Azlin (HC)_ at \[143\]) and made no mention that she was adding to them.

> (b)     Second, although Ang JAD’s pronouncement _could_ be interpreted to cover all types of government subsidies rather than only the types in play in that case, there was no express statement by Her Honour of such an intent. There was also no indication whether parties addressed the court on whether the specific nature of the different subsidies affected their eligibility to be claimed against the defendant.

> (c)     Third, the primary statement by Ang JAD that the appellant relied on was that “relief given by the state should also be an exception to the rule against double recovery.” Ang JAD cited Windeyer J’s dicta from _Espagne_, as endorsed in _The “MARA”_, as the basis for this statement. However, in the said extract, in addressing the benevolence exception, Windeyer J stated that it “… covers a variety of public charitable aid and **some** forms of relief given by the State as well as the produce of private benevolence.” (emphasis added). Ang JAD’s pronouncement was not qualified in the way that Windeyer J’s was, but it was not clear if a broadening of the scope of Windeyer J’s remarks to cover **all** types of relief given by the State was intended. If it was, there was no explanation as to why that should be so.

29     Given the potentially wide-ranging consequence if Ang JAD’s pronouncement was given the effect contended by the appellant, and bearing in mind that the decision was silent on key points, I preferred to take a cautious approach and thus limit the holding therein to the types of subsidies dealt with in that case. In this regard, I agreed with the DR’s conclusion that Ang JAD could not have intended to hold that all government subsidies were equivalent to insurance payouts in that these were paid out pursuant to a contract between a government and its citizens, such that they fell within the parameters or rationale of the insurance exception.[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18)

30     Since the types of Subsidies and Grants in question in the present case were quite different from those in issue in _Noor Azlin (HC)_, I did not consider myself bound by Ang JAD’s pronouncement to hold that the Subsidies and Grants received by the appellant were necessarily claimable as damages.

### Whether a new exception should be introduced

31     This brought me back to the issue of whether the Subsidies and Grants should constitute a new exception to the rule against double recovery. Based on the principles derived from case law set out above, the test was _whether the character or purpose of the Subsidies and Grants were such that they were meant to be dispositions in the appellant’s favour intended for her enjoyment and were not provided in relief of the respondent’s liability to fully compensate her_ (that is, whether the Subsidies and Grants possessed the “additional characteristic”). Ultimately, the result also had to be one that was just, reasonable and in keeping with public policy.

#### Is there an “Additional Characteristic”?

32     I began my analysis by considering the contention that the fact that a government gives subsidies to a citizen who pays taxes and satisfies certain conditions for receipt of the subsidies means that the government must have intended for this to be a disposition in the citizen’s favour and not provided in relief of a tortfeasor’s liability. I found this contention to be problematic because it seemed to presume that a disposition in the citizen’s favour meant that it was **also** not provided in relief of a tortfeasor’s liability. However, if these two elements were the same, then both would not need to be mentioned as constituents of the “additional characteristic”. That these two elements must be different was also evident from Dixon CJ’s observation in _Espagne_, that there were certain special services, aids, benefits, subventions, or hospital and pharmaceutical benefits which lightened the monetary burden of illness and in most communities were available to injured people, but which could not be claimed against a tortfeasor. Put another way, generic subsidies without the additional characteristic should not form an exception to the rule against double recovery.

33     The appellant’s argument was that because she _qualified_ for the Subsidies and Grants, these were intended for her enjoyment **_and_** were not provided in relief of the respondent’s liability to fully compensate her. As noted above, even if they were intended for her benefit because she qualified for them, the difficulty I had with this argument was that her qualifying for the benefits did not automatically mean that they were also not provided in relief of the respondent’s liability to compensate her.

34     Clearly, not all tax-paying citizens qualified for the Subsidies and Grants, as they were based on income and age. For those who did qualify, it was almost certain that they would not have paid the same amount of taxes over the years. I was thus slow to draw a direct link between the payment of tax by a person and the giving of subsidies by the Government to that person, and to conclude that this was the basis of a relationship that allowed the subsidies to form an exception to the rule against double recovery. As noted by the DR in his GD at \[37\]:

> “It is unremarkable to see governments setting up funds for the weak and vulnerable in the wider community. And it is commonplace to see governments implement national policies to subsidise the cost of important things like education and healthcare. The mere fact and existence of such benefits should not ordinarily raise the same inference that they were intended to be enjoyed over and above any claims that a plaintiff-victim would have against his tortfeasor.”

35     As for what the Government’s intent was in giving these Subsidies and Grants, apart from making healthcare costs more affordable for Singaporeans, there was unfortunately a dearth of information to guide the court. As noted above, the appellant contended that since s 22 of the Pioneer Act allowed the clawback of amounts paid in excess or in error, Parliament’s intent must have been for only eligible persons to receive the said subsidies. By extension, Parliament could not have intended for third-party tortfeasors to benefit from such subsidies by having their liability in damages reduced, especially since there was no express mention of such an intent.

36     However, the appellant had already received the benefit of her subsidies. Further, as noted by the DR in his GD at \[38\], the limitation of this argument was that it was equally true that there was no evidence of Parliament’s intent to allow double recovery in these cases. Parliament is clearly cognisant of the possibility that a patient receives a payment or reimbursement from a third party, and can provide for what happens in such cases. For example, reg 15 of the MediShield Life Scheme Regulations 2015 specifies that if an insured person’s claim for medical treatment or services has been paid from the MediShield Life Fund (“**MSL Fund**”) and the insured person receives payment or reimbursement from a third party arising out of a contractual or other obligation of that third party, then the insured person must repay what was paid out from the MSL Fund if the amount received from the third party and the amount paid out from the MSL Fund exceed the charges incurred by the insured person.

37     No provision was made in the Pioneer Act for such repayment to the PG Fund.[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19) S 22(1) of the Pioneer Act deals only with cash grants or certain subsidies paid in excess or in error (which do not include subsidies for the cost of health services rendered by a prescribed healthcare institution); s 22(2) deals with healthcare providers who have been overpaid by the PG Fund; s 22(3) deals with financial assistance received as a result of fraud; while s 22(4) deals with amounts paid in error or without authorisation.

38     There is thus no clear expression of intent by Parliament either way – whether victims may or may not claim from tortfeasors the value of their PG subsidies for the cost of health services rendered. This meant that there was no express pronouncement from which the court could determine whether the PG subsidy in the present case was given in relief of the respondent’s liability to fully compensate the appellant. As noted by the DR at \[44\] of his GD, which observation I agreed with, the difficulty in ascertaining the Government’s intent was even greater when we considered the generic government subsidies and the community grants. These were granted pursuant to a Government policy, and the only official articulations of the considerations underlying them were found in the official websites and write-ups referred to above. Ultimately, I was unable to find that the present Subsidies and Grants had the “additional characteristic” required for them to qualify as an exception to the rule against double recovery.

#### Justice, reasonableness and public policy

39     I also considered whether this outcome was just, reasonable and in keeping with public policy, as compared to the outcome sought by the appellant. Put another way, what could or should the court **imply** in the absence of a clear statement of Parliament’s intent?

40     It was not disputed that the appellant had the Subsidies and Grants directly reflected in her medical bills, and thus did not have to pay any amounts upfront. There was therefore no issue of the need to reimburse her for any loss suffered on this account. Nevertheless, this was not an impediment for Ang JAD in _Noor Azlin (HC)_. While it could be argued that it was “unjust” that a tortfeasor would “get away” with paying less with a subsidised victim than a non-subsidised one, I noted that in all such accident cases, the tortfeasor would take his victim as she is. Thus, a strong young person hit by a vehicle might only have grazes and bruises, but an older, weaker person might suffer a fracture – the damages payable for the medical expenses in these cases would be quite different. If the victim was an investment banker, the amount payable for loss of earnings would be vastly different than if the victim was a beggar. It might often be the case that a particular victim has certain qualities that result in the tortfeasor paying less in damages, but it is not always the case that this creates an injustice that must be redressed. This is especially so since tortfeasors in such cases do not choose their victims. Therefore, allowing a scenario where a tortfeasor paid less due to certain subsidies received by his victim did not necessarily create an unjust result or one that was against public policy. Bearing in mind that the appellant already received the benefit of the Subsidies and Grants, disallowing her from claiming for them from the respondent also did not create an unjust result for her.

41     As for whether it was reasonable to imply, in the absence of an express statement by Parliament, that the Subsidies and Grants were not given with the intent to provide relief to the respondent to fully compensate the appellant, I returned to the basic rule that a victim is generally not granted double recovery. In the absence of an express intent by Parliament that such double recovery should be allowed, the court should be slow to imply an outcome that was contrary to a general common law rule. This was especially so when Parliament can and has provided for scenarios where victims receive such payments or reimbursements, and what is to be done with them.

42     As noted by the DR, the effect of the appellant’s argument would be that a plaintiff like the appellant may “cash out government subsidies, transmuting what was _only intended as credit_ for her medical expenses into _fungible cash_.”[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20) Counsel for the respondent Mr Mark Cheng put it more dramatically, submitting that the appellant’s position would lead to the absurd result that accident victims who qualified for such subsidies would be put in a better financial position than they would have been in if the tort had not been committed, thereby possibly incentivising fraudulent claims.[^21]

43     Ms Vidthiya submitted that to avoid such an outcome, the court could order the appellant to repay the subsidies to the relevant “ministerial agencies”. The question then became who the appellant should make the repayments to. The difficulty with this was that these subsidies were “direct discounts” given by the hospitals or healthcare providers, as could be seen from the various bills. The PG subsidies were drawn from the PG Fund, but there was little information on where the generic government subsidies and community grants were drawn from. Would the appellant pay the amount back to the relevant hospital or polyclinic, and if so, would that healthcare provider then have to account to the PG Fund or the Consolidated Fund for the amounts? Who would police these repayments? This scenario is unlike repayments into one’s MediSave account, where there is a clearly identified recipient and a clear way of determining whether the right recipient has received the funds. Ms Vidthiya submitted that this sort of logistical difficulty should not impede the court in making an order for the appellant to repay the Subsidies and Grants. However, this was more than a mere logistical difficulty. Such an order had an implication on how public bodies dealt with these repaid funds, and who was empowered to receive the funds. In the absence of a clear process by which such funds would be accounted for and repaid, my view was that the court should be slow to order a government agency to receive funds that it was not empowered to.

44     Given the difficulties with identifying who to repay the funds to, it was a very real possibility that the appellant would be unable to return the funds, which brought us back to the scenario in which she would receive a windfall of the amount of her government subsidies. The generic government subsidies received by the appellant were given to Singaporeans and permanent residents who were accommodated in Class B2 and Class C wards in hospitals. While the appellant qualified for these, so would many other patients. This was the same for the PG subsidies, which all members of the PG would have qualified for. Similarly for the community hospital grants – they were listed as subsidies for those who satisfied a means test. The pool of persons who would receive these Subsidies and Grants was thus very large. Although it would only be a portion of that pool of persons who would be victims of accidents, it could still form a potentially large number of people. In the absence of clear Parliamentary intent that all such victims could receive such payments from tortfeasors and “encash” their subsidies in this manner, I declined to allow this outcome as I was unable to conclude that it was reasonable and in accordance with public policy.

45     A final point I noted was this. Considering the four “lines of defence” in the Government’s healthcare framework mentioned above, it could be seen that the type of assistance granted increased in specificity from the first to the fourth “line of defence”. The population size of the recipients also decreased substantially by the fourth “line of defence” since that assistance was granted as a safety net or last resort for a patient who was at the limit of her financial resources. The case law thus far has allowed victims to claim damages for payments made from the schemes falling under the second, third and fourth “lines of defence”. The schemes under the second and third “lines of defence” have been likened to insurance schemes, and claims for payments made from MediShield Life and MediSave have thus been allowed (even in the present case). Claims under the fourth “line of defence” have been allowed, as in _Noor Azlin (HC)_ – my view was that allowing such claims could be rationalised in that there were clearly identified funds at play, the recipients of such aid were at the limits of their financial capability and the intention to allow them to benefit from a payment which was not provided in relief of any liability to fully compensate them might be easier to discern. Claims under the first “line of defence” thus remain the holdout. Given the generic nature of such subsidies and potentially large number of accident victims who could claim these as damages, and the absence of a clear intent from Parliament as to whether this should be allowed, I declined to expand the classes of exceptions further to encompass subsidies falling under the first “line of defence”.

## Conclusion

46     The issue identified at the outset was therefore answered in the negative. I affirmed the DR’s decision to disallow the appellant’s claim for the amount of Subsidies and Grants she received, and dismissed the appeal.

47     Having heard parties on costs, I fixed costs at $2,200 (all-in), to be paid by the appellant to the respondent.
