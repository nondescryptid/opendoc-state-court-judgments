Criminal Law – Road Traffic – Speeding

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 2/2020/01.\]

14 May 2020

### District Judge Carol Ling Feng Yong:

## Introduction

1       The Accused, representing himself, claimed trial to a single charge of speeding. The charge read:

> “You… are charged that you, on 2 August 2018, at about 1:33 pm along Lim Chu Kang Road lamp post 101 towards Neo Tiew Road, Singapore, did drive bus van no PC6122L at a speed of 73kmph, such speed being in excess of the imposed speed limit of 60kmph of the vehicle and you have thereby committed an offence under section 63(4) read with section 63(1) of the Road Traffic Act and punishable under section 131(2) of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276.”

2       At the conclusion of the trial, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him on the charge. He was fined a sum of $800. The Accused has filed an appeal against his conviction only.

## Undisputed Facts

3       It was undisputed that on 2 August 2018 at about 1:33 pm, the Accused was driving PC 6122L (“the bus”) along Lim Chu Kang Road towards Neo Tiew Road. It was also undisputed that the bus had an imposed speed limit of 60 kilometres per hour (“kmph”).

## Case for the Prosecution

4       It is the Prosecution’s case that on 2 August 2018, when the Accused was driving the bus along Lim Chu Kang Road towards Neo Tiew Road, he had driven it at a speed of 73kmph. As the maximum permissible speed of the bus was 60kmph, the Accused was speeding.

### Incident Image

5       The Prosecution tendered into court a print-out from the “Red Flex” system[^1] from the Traffic Police (Exhibit P2). This exhibit showed an image of a bus captured by a speed enforcement camera, along with incident details, vehicle details and the offence disclosed. In this case, Exhibit P2 captured PC 6122L, the bus that the Accused was driving on 2 August 2018 along Lim Chu Kang Road at about 1:33 pm, travelling at a speed of 73kmph. Exhibit P2 also stated that the imposed speed limit of the bus was 60kmph.

6       PW1 SSgt Muhammad Bin Rohani, a surveillance camera unit data post- at-scene officer, testified that the “Red Flex” system automatically generates the incident details based on the image captured[^2]. The first-stage officer involved in the process would check the details automatically generated in the system, which would include ensuring that the lane the vehicle was travelling on was correct[^3]; that the detector loop was pointing to the correct vehicle[^4]. The first-stage officer would also enter the vehicle registration number into the system based on the image captured, as well as other details such as vehicle type, laden/unladen weight, and speed limit of the vehicle[^5]. A description of the offence committed would then be generated[^6].

7       Once the first-stage validation had been done, PW1 SSgt Muhammad Bin Rohani testified that the case would be sent to him for confirmation[^7]. PW1 SSgt Muhammad Bin Rohani would also ensure that the details were accurate before generating the “Report of a Traffic Offence” document as seen in Exhibit P1[^8], from the Traffic Police’s Traffic Incident Management System[^9].

### Monthly Maintenance Reports

8       Through PW2 Mr Chua Yong Khiang, the Prosecution tendered monthly maintenance reports for the period:

> (a)     16 June 2018 – 26 July 2018 (Exhibit P3); and

> (b)     27 July 2018 – 26 August 2018 (Exhibit P4).

9       PW2 Mr Chua Yong Khiang is a senior Operations Manager of TKH Security and Solution Private Limited, formerly Isolectra Far East, a company that provides maintenance services for Traffic Police’s speed enforcement cameras and red light cameras. In court, PW2 Mr Chua Yong Khiang explained that the speed cameras would be serviced monthly. By “service”, this meant that his staff would do a physical inspection of the speed camera to ensure there was no physical damage; they would clean the lens to make sure the focus was clear and also perform other functional checks on the system. The scope of the servicing work done in respect of speed cameras was clearly set out by the checklist in the maintenance reports[^10].

10     The monthly maintenance reports tendered through PW2 Mr Chua Yong Khiang showed that Camera 3[^11] (which was the speed enforcement camera for Lim Chu Kang Road – the road on which the Accused’s bus was travelling on) had been regularly serviced and was in good working condition on 2 August 2018. Prior to the offence on 2 August 2018, Camera 3 was last serviced on 2 July 2018[^12]. A routine servicing of Camera 3 was also done on 3 August 2018[^13]. On both occasions when Camera 3 was serviced, Exhibits P3 and P4 recorded that Camera 3 was working fine and had passed all the tests on the maintenance checklist.

### Certificate of Verification

11     Apart from monthly servicing, the antennas for the speed cameras, which are used to read the speed of the vehicles, would also be sent back to the factory in the Netherlands yearly for calibration. In this case, the antenna in Camera 3 was calibrated on 13 June 2018. Upon calibration, a Certificate of Verification (Exhibit P5) was issued, confirming that the antenna in Camera 3 had complied with all specifications and passed all the tests[^14]. PW2 Mr Chua Yong Khiang further explained how the tests were conducted[^15].

12     In his evidence, PW2 Mr Chua Yong Khiang testified that he received the image and data files of the image captured in the speed enforcement camera (as shown in Exhibit P2), from the Traffic Police sometime in October 2018 as Traffic Police required a clarification. He then sent the image and the “XML” file back to factory for verification to ensure that the image captured was valid[^16]. Upon checking the parameters which included the date, the time, the lane which the vehicle was travelling on and the speed of the vehicle[^17], the factory confirmed that there was no error on the file[^18].

### Speed Limiter Inspection Report

13     It was undisputed that on the day of the alleged offence, the bus was fitted with a speed limiter.

14     As part of their case, Prosecution adduced evidence that the bus had undergone a speed limiter test on 29 August 2018. The Speed Limiter Inspection Report was admitted as Exhibit P7 through PW3 Mr Musliadi Bin Rahwi, a vehicle inspector at VICOM who inspected the bus and prepared the report. Exhibit P7 disclosed the following:-

> (a)     The speed limiter in the bus was a built-in type; this was also confirmed by PW3 Mr Musliadi Bin Rahwi’s evidence[^19];

> (b)     When tested, the speed limiter was responsive. The travelling speed of the bus was cut and did not exceed 60kmph. PW3 Mr Musliadi Bin Rahwi personally performed the accuracy check[^20].

15     PW4 Mr S Madasamy, an officer with VICOM for 35 years, confirmed that the speed limiter in the bus PC 6122L was a “built-in type”. He testified that the speed limiter could only be disabled by a technically trained person, by means of removing the fuse which will cut off the electric supply to the Engine Control Unit (ECU) of the vehicle, thus preventing it from sensing the speed of the vehicle and working to cut off the fuel supply[^21]. He informed the Court that it was not possible to detect whether the speed limiter had been disabled and subsequently re-activated before inspection.

## Case for the Defence

16     The evidence of a speed limiter which was tested to be in good working condition on 29 August 2018 was the crux of the Accused’s defence.

17     The Accused, a bus-driver for ten years, was adamant that he was not speeding on 2 August 2018. He contended that he could not have driven the bus at 73kmph on 2 August 2018, a speed in excess of 60kmph since the speed limiter was working well and was proven so when tested by VICOM on 29 August 2018. The Accused had sent the bus in for a speed limiter inspection pursuant to a request dated 17 August 2018 by the Traffic Police (Exhibit P8). On the stand, the Accused also testified that the bus had passed its annual VICOM inspection on 13 August 2018[^22] (Exhibit D1). The Accused submitted that there was no evidence that he had tampered with the speed limiter.

## Issues

18     The issues in this case were:

> (a)     How reliable was the Prosecution’s evidence in capturing the Accused’s bus speeding on 2 August 2018;

> (b)     Whether the evidence of a functional speed limiter cast reasonable doubt on the Prosecution’s evidence.

## Reliability of the Prosecution’s Evidence

19     The Prosecution bears the evidential burden of adducing sufficient evidence to establish the fact that the Accused was driving the bus at a speed of 73kmph on 2 August 2018, a speed above the imposed speed limit of 60kmph of the vehicle.

20     To do so, the Prosecution produced the incident image (Exhibit P2) captured by the speed enforcement camera, the monthly maintenance reports of the speed enforcement camera (Exhibits P3 and P4) and the Certificate of Verification relating to the calibration of the antenna of the camera (Exhibit P5). PW1 SSgt Muhammad Bin Rohani and PW2 Mr Chua Yong Khiang also gave material evidence relating to the incident image and the various reports tendered.

### Authenticity and reliability of the reports

21     As Prosecution acknowledged, documentary exhibits are usually tendered through their makers; individuals who authored them. This ensures the authenticity and the reliability of the documents tendered[^23]. In this case, I was mindful that PW2 Mr Chua Yong Khiang was not the person who personally serviced the speed camera in question; he was also not the person who calibrated the device. Notwithstanding, I was satisfied that the reports tendered in Exhibits P3, P4 and P5 were authentic and could be safely relied on.

22     Even though he was not the maker of the reports, PW2 Mr Chua Yong Khiang produced the original reports to the Court for inspection. They were “primary evidence” under section 64 of the Evidence Act, Chapter 97. In the course of his testimony, it was also clear that PW2 Mr Chua Yong Khiang’s evidence in relation to the reports was borne out of a personal knowledge of the content in the reports insofar as he was familiar with the source, the purpose and the content of the reports. His testimony in respect of the reports was not guesswork or based on conjecture. These were reports retrieved from within PW2 Mr Chua Yong Khiang’s company in which he was a Senior Operations Manager, and were documents forming part of the business records of TKH Security and Solutions Pte Ltd, whom he represented in court.

23     In terms of authenticity, there was no allegation by the Accused at any time during the trial that these reports had been fabricated and/or were not genuine. The evidence of PW2 Mr Chua Yong Khiang was not challenged by the Accused on that basis. In addition, the reports tendered through PW2 Mr Chua Yong Khiang contained largely technical information, comprising of standard checklists, record of schedules and work done in compliance with set processes, as opposed to information which may be privy only to the maker of the documents. Having considered the nature of the reports, I was satisfied that they were authentic and were reliable pieces of evidence on which I could place full weight on.

24     Having scrutinized the evidence and reports relating to the speed enforcement camera, I was satisfied that the camera was in good working condition on 2 August 2018 when it captured the Accused’s bus travelling at 73kmph.

### The speed camera was regularly maintained

25     The speed enforcement camera (Camera 3) which caught the Accused’s bus speeding on 2 August 2018 was serviced regularly. The monthly maintenance checks were thorough[^24]. The maintenance reports for the relevant period of time (Exhibits P3 and P4) showed that Camera 3 was serviced on 2 July 2018 and 3 August 2018. On both occasions of servicing, there were no problems with Camera 3, as indicated on the maintenance checklists. When Camera 3 was serviced on 3 August 2018 - just a day after the offence, the camera passed all checks on the maintenance checklist. The reasonable inference which may be drawn from this fact was that Camera 3 was in all likelihood, in good working condition on the day of the offence. The monthly maintenance report (Exhibit P4) also showed that the batteries in Camera 3 had been replaced at regular intervals[^25].

### No faults were reported in the speed camera

26     In addition, there were no faults reported by Traffic Police in relation to Camera 3 for the pertinent period of 27 July to 26 August 2018 (Exhibit P4). There were only two faults reported, on 2 July 2018 and on 23 July 2018 for the earlier period, and they were faults unrelated to a mechanical or software failure[^26]. The presence of faults reported by Traffic Police in the different speed enforcement cameras around the island and documented in Exhibits P3 and P4 at various times, demonstrated the sensitivity of the system in these speed enforcement cameras to pick out and alert its users to its failures or weaknesses. There were noticeably no faults reported in Camera 3 for the period before and after 2 August 2018.

### Antenna of the speed camera was calibrated

27     The antennas used in the speed enforcement cameras were calibrated on a yearly basis. Based on the Certificate of Verification (Exhibit P5), the antenna in Camera 3 had been calibrated before the incident, on 13 June 2018 and was found to be in compliance with specifications stated in the verification methods. As submitted by the Prosecution, as seen on the overleaf of P5, the calibration was conducted over a wide range of speeds (from 22kmph to 247kmph) and across three difference lanes. The deviation between the simulated speed and the actual speed was also marginal[^27].

### Accuracy of the incident image captured

28     PW1 SSgt Muhammad Bin Rohani testified that the speed enforcement camera system came with a two-stage verification process. In relation to the incident image captured in Exhibit P2, PW1 SSgt Muhammad Bin Rohani confirmed that the officers involved checked for abnormalities in the image captured by the camera against the details generated in the system[^28]. No abnormalities were detected at both stages and the incident captured on the speed enforcement camera, as documented in Exhibit P2 passed both levels of checks.

29     In this instance, the image of the bus captured on 2 August 2018 even underwent an additional “third-stage verification” when it was sent, together with the XML file, to the factory. The result was that _“the lane, the speeds, and the approaching directions is all valid and there was no error on the file_”[^29]. The data captured by the image were verified to be accurate[^30].

30     I was satisfied that the speed enforcement camera was in good working condition on 2 August 2018 and it had accurately captured the image of the Accused’s bus with a detected travelling speed of 73kmph on the day in question.

## Did a functioning speed limiter on 29 August 2018 cast reasonable doubt on the Prosecution’s case?

31     As mentioned above, there was an undisputed piece of evidence that the in-built speed limiter in the Accused’s bus had been proven to be fully functional when it was tested on 29 August 2018 (Exhibit (P7). The Accused submitted that since the speed limiter was proven to be working, it would have prevented him from speeding. The Accused could not have been driving his bus at 73kmph on 2 August 2018.

32     In this regard, the Prosecution submitted that the evidential burden had shifted to the Accused. They submitted that they had in their case, adduced sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt to prove that the Accused’s bus was travelling at 73kmph on 2 August 2018. The evidential burden then shifted to the Accused to adduce evidence to bring the Prosecution’s case below the standard of proof by creating a reasonable doubt[^31].

### No evidence that the speed limiter was functional on 2 August 2018

33     Whilst it could not be disputed that the speed limiter was working on 29 August 2018 when it was tested by VICOM, I could not overlook the fact that there was no evidence placed before me that the speed limiter was similarly functional on the day of the offence i.e. 2 August 2018.

34     Accused could not claim that the speed limiter was in good working condition on 2 August 2018 since it was his own testimony that he did not notice the speedometer in the bus on 2 August 2018. He did not know the speed he was driving the bus at[^32]. There was no evidence from the Accused that the speed of the bus was below 60kmph as he was driving it along Lim Chu Kang Road towards Neo Tiew Road that day. On the stand, the Accused also acknowledged that the speed limiter could have malfunctioned[^33]. If the speed limiter had malfunctioned on 2 August 2018, the Accused agreed that he would not known[^34]. Other than a bare assertion by the Accused that the speed limiter in the buses he had driven before had never malfunctioned, there was no other evidence to support that assertion.

35     The VICOM test certificate (Exhibit D1) dated 13 August 2018 tendered by the Defence showed that the bus had been examined and complied with all prescribed statutory requirements. However, I did not find this piece of evidence helpful to the Defence’s case. This was a routine, annual VICOM inspection for purposes of renewing the vehicle licence of the bus[^35]. There was no evidence that the annual VICOM inspection involved the testing of the speed limiter of the bus[^36] and/or that the speed limiter was found to be functional.

### No evidence adduced by the Defence of the speed at which the bus was travelling at on 2 August 2018

36     The only objective evidence of the speed at which the bus was travelling at on the day in question was from the speed enforcement camera. As mentioned, the Accused admitted that he did not watch the speedometer and did not know the speed he was travelling at. There was no evidence from the Accused that he consciously kept to the speed limit of 60kmph when driving the bus along Lim Chu Kang Road towards Neo Tiew Road that day in question. It did not appear that the Accused was even mindful of the speed at which the bus was travelling at. The Accused’s choice to be entirely reliant on the speed limiter in the bus could not mitigate his lack of direct evidence and personal knowledge of the speed at which the bus was travelling at.

37     Even with an in-built speed limiter, the Accused should have taken reasonable care to ensure that the bus he was driving was not travelling beyond the imposed speed limit of the vehicle. He could have kept an eye on the speedometer and/or be conscious of the speed at which the bus was travelling at. If either of that had been done, the Accused would have been aware whether the speed limiter which was in-built in the bus, was effective in keeping the speed of the bus below 60kmph or had malfunctioned on 2 August 2018.

38     Considering the totality of the Defence’s case, I found that there was no evidence before the court that the speed limiter in the bus was in fact working on 2 August 2018. The Accused’s assertion of a functional speed limiter in the bus on 2 August 2018 was not supported by any objective evidence[^37]. A test result only 27 days later showing that the speed limiter was working, was in my view, insufficient to cast a reasonable doubt on the accuracy of the image captured by the speed enforcement camera which detected the speed of the bus at 73kmph, which was above its permissible limit.

39     Even if the Accused did not intend to speed on 2 August 2018, the objective evidence from the speed enforcement camera was that the bus was travelling at a speed of 73kmph that day. The Accused failed to exercise reasonable care to ensure he was not speeding. Since speeding was a strict liability offence (this is made clear by the language in section 63 of the Road Traffic Act and an offence concerned with the protection and safety of the public, amongst other indicators), the Accused would be liable for the offence of speeding.

### Did Accused tamper with the speed limiter?

40     Even with the presence of such a speed limiter, there may be several possibilities how the bus could still be travelling at a speed above 60kmph, malfunction being one of them. Another possibility suggested by the Prosecution was that the speed limiter could have been tampered with by the Accused without leaving a trace[^38]. However, based on the evidence, I found the suggestion to be highly speculative:

> (a)     The in-built speed limiter was not one which could be easily disabled. PW4 S Madasamy had testified that that the speed limiter could be disabled by a technically trained person. The disabling involved the removing of the fuse from the fuse box, which he reiterated in evidence, _“can be done by a technically trained person_”, for example mechanics who know how to repair the speed limiter[^39]. There was no evidence presented which suggested that the Accused had the technical knowledge and/or expertise to do so;

> (b)     There was no evidence before me suggesting that the Accused had driven or arranged for the bus to be brought to a “_technically trained person_” to deactivate the speed limiter prior to 2 August 2018, and subsequently, to re-activate the speed limiter prior to the speed limiter testing on 29 August 2018;

> (c)     The fact that it would be impossible to detect signs of tampering and that the inspection of the bus was not a “_surprise inspection_” did not strengthen the Prosecution’s suggestion that the Accused probably did tamper with the speed limiter of the bus since there was no basis to even point to such a possibility.

## Conclusion

41     Whilst it is the Prosecution’s burden to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt, it is not the Prosecution’s duty to eradicate any doubts the court may have in a case. As stated in the case of _Teo Keng Pong v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] SGHC 183</span> at \[68\]:

> _“It bears repeating that the burden on the Prosecution is to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. It is not to prove the case beyond all doubts. In almost all cases, there will remain that minutiae of doubt……….…The question in all cases is whether such doubts are real or reasonable, or whether they are merely fanciful. It is only when the doubts belong to the former category that the Prosecution had not discharged its burden, and the accused is entitled to an acquittal”_

42     I was constantly mindful that the burden to prove their case against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt remained with the Prosecution throughout the trial. This burden does not shift; it was the Prosecution’s burden to discharge. Whilst it is not for the Defence to disprove the Prosecution’s case or strictly speaking, to prove any fact; he needs only to raise evidence which would be sufficient to cast a reasonable doubt on the Prosecution’s evidence, I found that the Accused had failed to do so in this case.

43     I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved their case against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt. There was clear and reliable evidence to show that the Accused had driven his bus at a speed on 73kmph on 2 August 2018 along Lim Chu Kang Road towards Neo Tiew Road, when the imposed speed limit of the bus was only 60kmph. Accordingly, I found the Accused guilty of the charge of speeding and convicted him accordingly.
