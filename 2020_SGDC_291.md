### District Judge Christopher Goh Eng Chiang:

## Introduction

1       The accused claimed trial to two counts under s 28(1)(b) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed) (“Moneylenders Act”). He was convicted after a trial and was sentenced to a total of 12 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane.

2       The accused, being dissatisfied with the conviction and the sentence that I have imposed, has appealed against it.

## The Charge

3       The accused claimed trial to the following charges:

> (a)     DAC-941427-2018:

## Case for the Prosecution

### The Wellington Circle unit (DAC-941427-2018)

4       One Lam Yee Koon (“PW8”) was living at Block 507B Wellington Circle, #XXX (“the Wellington Circle unit”) with his son, Lam Choon Huat Kelvin (“PW9”).

5       On 16 December 2018, PW8 was listening to music in the living room when he noticed something moving outside along the corridor. The wooden door of the flat was opened. He then went up to look and saw that his metal gate was locked with a bicycle lock. Upon closer inspection, he noted that the bicycle lock was not really locked. The end of the lock was threaded into the locking mechanism, but it was not pushed to the end, and therefore, the locking mechanism was not activated.

6       He pulled out the bicycle lock and came out of the house. PW8 noticed a note[^1] on the shoe rack. Seeing nothing else, PW8 placed the bicycle lock on the metal bar along the corridor and called his son, PW9 and informed of what had happened.

7       It subsequently transpired that PW9 had borrowed money from a loanshark about a month previously. At the time of this incident, he had still not fully repaid the loan. Earlier that day, on 16 December 2018, he had received a message on the WhatsApp application from one “Alvin”, with whom he had previous communication with. There was a photograph showing the entrance of the Wellington Circle unit with the gate locked. He had called home to check but PW8 informed him that nothing was amiss. A short while later, he received a call from PW8 to inform him that the house gate had been locked. PW9 then called the police.

8       When PW9 reached home, the bicycle lock was no longer on the gate. The police were already at the scene. He confirmed that the name on the note that PW8 had found on the shoe rack was him.

9       The accused came by to the Wellington Circle unit a few weeks later. According to PW9, the accused was remorseful for his actions. He apologised profusely and wanted to make up for what he had done by whatever means that he could, including offering to give tuition to PW9’s younger siblings if he had any.

### The Woodlands Drive Unit (DAC-942884-2018)

10     One Lee Kok Min (“PW10”) lived at Block 623 Woodlands Drive 52 #XXX (“the Woodlands Drive unit”) with his son, Li Fuquiang Lawrence (“PW11”).

11     On 16 December, sometime after 2100 hrs, PW10 had just returned home from work. He first noticed that someone had splashed red paint on the door and gate of his home. He then noticed that a bicycle lock had been placed around the metal gate. The lock was not engaged. Therefore, PW10 removed the lock, entered his home and immediately called his wife. His wife, who had left the house sometime past 2000 hrs had not noticed anything amiss when she left home. PW10 then called the police at 2212 hrs.

12     PW11 is a private hire car driver. He was on the road when he was informed by his father as to what had happened. He returned home immediately. He was interviewed by the investigation officer the following day. He maintained that he had never borrowed any money from loansharks. However, as he had previously lost his identity card, he therefore suspected that someone may have used it to borrow money from loansharks.

13     Sometime after the incident, the accused came by to apologise for what he had done. PW10 was not at home at the time. According to PW11, the accused apologised to both putting the lock on his gate and the splashing of the paint[^2]. Admiring his courage to admit to what he had done, PW11 accepted the accused’s apology. PW11 even subsequently accompanied the accused to several of his court hearings.

### Investigations and arrest of the accused

14     SI Saifuddin bin Selamat (“PW5”) was the initial investigation officer for the incident at the Wellington Circle unit. As part of his investigations, he retrieved POLCAM video footage from the cameras located at Block 507B. The first footage showed a suspect arriving at the lift lobby of Block 507B at about 1443 hrs. The suspect is then seen entering the lift and the lift could subsequently be seen going up to the eighth floor and then back down to the sixth floor. The second footage is taken from the camera located between the first and second floor of the staircase of Block 507B. At about 1451 hrs, the same suspect is seen coming down the staircase.

15     The suspect appeared to be walking in the direction of Sembawang MRT Station. Accordingly, the CCTV footage at Sembawang MRT Station was reviewed. The EZ-link card used to enter Sembawang MRT Station was then identified, and from this, the identity of the suspect was established to be that of the accused.

16     Through further screening of the EZ-link card used, it was revealed that the accused was often at the Nanyang Technological University (“NTU”) Hall 7 bus-stop. Therefore, on 18 December 2018, police officers staked out the area around the bus-stop. The accused was subsequently identified and arrested at 0939 hrs on the same day[^3].

17     Upon his arrest, PW5 conducted an interview with the accused at the scene. The accused told PW5 that he had been browsing through an online portal called Gumtree and had come across a job advertisement promising fast cash. The job had required him to place a lock and leave a note at someone’s home. He admitted that he had gone to Block 507B Wellington Circle and had placed the lock and note at the unit.

18     The accused was then brought to the unit he was residing in at NTU Hall 7 where he identified the clothes that he was wearing on the day of the Wellington Circle incident. A handphone was also seized. The accused was then brought to the Woodlands Regional Lock-up and he was charged in court on 19 December 2018 and remanded for a week for investigations to be conducted.

19     Subsequently, it was established that the accused was also involved in the acts of harassment at the Woodlands Drive unit. Video footage retrieved by SSGT Ryan Hong Xiong Xin (“PW4”), the Investigation Officer for the case, showed that at about 2128 hrs, the accused had alighted from Admiralty MRT Station. The video footage showed him arriving at the first-floor lift lobby of Block 623, Woodlands Drive at about 2143 hrs. He entered the lift about a minute later.

20     The second video footage is taken from a camera located between the first and second floor of the staircase of Block 623. It showed the accused coming down the staircase at about 2153 hrs.

### Statements of the accused

21     In the evening of 18 December 2018, at the Woodlands Regional Lock-up, SI Gan Chee Muar (“PW6”) interviewed the accused and served him with the first charge (ie concerning the Wellington Circle unit). In a statement recorded under s 23 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (“CPC”)[^4], The accused admitted that he was paid $150 by one “David” for locking the house gate and to place a note outside the house. He knew that “David” was a loanshark. He did not borrow money from “David” but did the job because he had no money for food and transport. He was sorry for what he had done.

22     In the afternoon of 21 December 2018, SI Azman Bin Hasim (“PW7”) recorded the accused’s long statement[^5] in the lock-up during his period of remand. In his statement, the accused admitted to the two offences. He told PW7 that

> “ ….. 2.    Sometime in December 2018, I find myself to ran out of money and have difficulties to buy food for myself. I then started to look job. On 15 Dec 2018, I managed to find one in a website called Gumtree. I saw a post offering a fast cash job and contact the person for more details. I then whatapp the person and I informed that I am interested for the job and the person who identified himself as David' agreed to employed me. I could not recall the handphone number of David whom I communicate with. During the communication David told me that my job is to lock the house unit, splash paint and also to write debtor note and leave it at the unit. From there I knew that 'David' is an Unlicensed Moneylender or also known as 'Ah Long'. He told me that for a unit that l do he will pay me $150/. I told David that I do not want to do it as I was scared. He however tried to persuade me and he finally agreed that I just have to padlock the gate and leave the debtor note only. I finally agreed to the agreement with David.

> 3.    As agreed, I started to work for David on 16.12.18. (1) The first unit I was told to go is at Blk 507B Wellington Circle at the 6th floor (Recorder note: Accused unable to recall the unit number). I went there by using MRT and alight at Sembawang MRT. From the MRT, I just walk to the location. I reach there around 2 plus in the afternoon. At the unit I had padlock the gate unit with a black colour bicycle lock and also leave a debtor note which I handwritten myself as instructed by David what to write on the note. I could only remember that he asked me to write something like 'Last warning and to call back with a handphone number'. I wished to state that for the bicycle lock, I had bought it myself. After doing the job, I had to take photo of the unit and show that the job is done and send the picture to the Unlicensed Moneylender 'David' whom I worked for.

> 4.    After completing the first job, I left and returned to my hostel. While at my hostel David whatapp me and asking me to do another job for him. I informed him that I do not want to do anymore as I was afraid being caught. He however kept calling me to do the job and he also increase the payment to $250/- for the job. After thinking for sometime I agreed to it as I want to do the last job for him so that I have enough money for meal before I could find a new job. (2) On the same day 16 Dec 2018 at around 9plus evening, I took the MRT and drop at Admiralty MRT station and walked to Blk 623 woodlands Drive 52 (Recorder note: Accused unable to recall the unit number). At the unit I had used a black colour bicycle lock to lock the unit gate. I also had splash red at the door and gate. After the job done, I took a photo and send to the Unlicensed moneylender 'David.

> 5.    I wished to state that the paint and the bicycle lock that I used was bought by myself. David had bank transfer to my account $150/- on 16 Dec 2018 and $250/- on 17 Dec 2018. After doing the 2 job, I decided to stopped working for him by giving him excuses.

>     ……..”

23     On 24 December 2018, PW7 served the second charge and recorded the cautioned statement[^6] of the accused. In his statement, the accused admitted to the second charge and sought leniency.

## Case for the Defence

24     The accused was the only witness in his own defence. On 15 December 2018, he had been looking for a job on several online job portals, including one called Gumtree as he had no money. On Gumtree was a job advertisement promising fast cash for an easy job. He therefore responded to the advertisement _via_ the WhatsApp application. The next day, on 16 December 2020, he received a phone call where the caller, one “David”, asked him the usual questions for a standard job application. The accused provided the necessary information.

25     Later that day, the accused was told what he had to do. He was asked to purchase a lock and to get a piece of paper. When he purchased the lock, he took a photograph and sent it to the caller as proof of purchase. This was when he was told what he needed to do, namely, to lock a gate and write a note. He was also asked to splash paint, but he refused to do so. He was promised $150 for the job. The accused told the court that he did not want to go through with the job, but he felt threatened by the caller because he, the caller, knew his personal information, including where he stayed, and told him that he would do something to him.

26     Despite his misgivings, the accused finally went down to the Wellington Circle unit by MRT. He was still reluctant to do the job and claimed to be in a state of panic. Eventually, he decided that if he could just leave the note and pretended to lock the gate, he could “escape” the situation. He therefore looped the bicycle lock around the gate to look as though he had secured it and took a picture for the caller. He also left the note there with the message that he was asked to write. He then left the block and headed back towards the MRT station.

27     Later that evening, whilst he was having dinner with a friend, the caller called him and asked him to do one more job. This job was regarding the Woodlands Drive unit. Again, the accused was asked to do three things, namely, to lock the gate, leave a note and splash paint. The accused was, again, initially reluctant to do so. However, he thought that since it would be night, the location would be dark enough to mask his non-compliance with the directions of the caller.

28     According to the accused, he first took a photograph of a can of paint to pretend that he had purchased a can of paint for the job. He thought that it would be dark enough so that it would not be clear from the photograph whether he had indeed splashed paint on the unit. However, he eventually did purchase a can of red paint as he was afraid that the caller would ask him for proof of purchase. Having purchased the paint, he then threw it away together with the receipt. He also wrote the note that he was asked to do so. He took a photograph of the note, sent it to the caller to show that he had written it. He subsequently also threw it away.

29     When he reached Woodlands Drive location, he went up to the unit and likewise, instead of locking the metal gate, he simply looped the bicycle lock around it to look as though it was secured. The accused claimed that there was already paint splashed on the door when he arrived at the unit. He thus took advantage of this fact. He took a photograph of the door splashed with red paint and pretended that he was the one who had splashed paint on the door like he had been asked to do so. After this, he rushed back to NTU.

30     The next day, 17 December 2010, he was again contacted by the caller _via_ the WhatsApp application to do more jobs[^7]. The accused claimed that he did not perform any more jobs. Although the messages seem to suggest that he did, the accused claimed that he had been only pretending to do the jobs when, in reality, he was in his hostel room.

31     The accused explained that when he was arrested, he was not in a “good state”. Hence, he simply signed the first cautioned statement when he was asked to do so. Subsequently, he signed the long statement as he was going to get bail after that. He told the court that he was “not really thinking” when he signed the documents.

## Analysis of the Evidence

### Did the accused act on behalf on an unlicensed moneylender?

32     The first element of the charge that prosecution is required to show is that the accused knew that he was acting on behalf of an unlicensed moneylender named “David”.

33     In my view, it is undisputed that the accused knew that the caller, “David”, was an unlicensed moneylender. Whilst he may have not known of this fact when he first enquired about the job on 15 December 2018, or when he was first contacted by “David” the following day, it is clear from the evidence before the court that the that he knew this fact prior to the acts of harassment at he committed at the Wellington Circle unit. In fact, the accused himself admitted that he knew this when:

> (a)     in his cautioned statement made to the police on 18 December 2018[^8], he admitted that he knew _“ … “David” is a loanshark”;_

> (b)     in his long statement made to the police, he admitted that when “David” told him that “ _….. \[his\] job is to lock the house unit, splash paint and also to write debtor note and leave it at the unit….. ”_, he knew that “David” was an unlicensed moneylender[^9]; and

> (c)     in cross-examination, he agreed that he was acting on the instructions of an unlicensed moneylender named “David” when he was at the Wellington Circle unit on 16 December 2018 at about 1450 hrs [^10];

34     Despite knowing that “David” was an unlicensed moneylender, and his supposed misgivings, the accused nonetheless proceeded to work for him.

### Did the accused commit the acts of harassment at the Wellington Circle unit?

35     The answer to this question is an unqualified yes. The accused had admitted to committing both acts of harassment at the Wellington Circle unit, namely, by fastening the main gate of the unit with a bicycle lock and writing the debtor note and placing it on the shoe rack outside the unit.

36     In his own examination-in-chief [^11], the accused described what had happened in the afternoon of 16 December 2018. He had gone to Woodlands Circle unit by MRT. Upon reaching the block, he went up to the unit. He then placed the lock around the metal gate without locking it and left the note on the shoe rack. He then took a photograph of the bicycle lock and left the block. He was subsequently paid $150 for the job.

37     This version of events given by the accused in examination-in-chief is not only consistent but very similar to the long statement that he gave the police[^12].

38     In addition, I note that the accused does not deny that he is the person wearing a cap and carrying a haversack in the CCTV footage that is seen going up the lift and again coming down the stairs at. He also does not deny that he returned to the Wellington Circle unit sometime after the incident to apologise for his actions. This was something which he need not have done if he did not commit the acts.

### Did the accused commit the acts of harassment at the Woodlands Drive unit?

39     The two acts that the accused is alleged to have committed at the Woodlands Drive unit is the fastening of the main gate of the unit with a bicycle lock and the splashing red coloured paint on the main door. From the evidence before the court, the accused does not deny fastening the main gate of the unit with the bicycle lock. However, he denied splashing the red coloured paint.

40     The accused admitted in examination-in-chief that after he arrived at the Woodlands Drive location, he went up by the lift to the Woodland Drive unit where he looped the lock around the metal gate[^13]. This is one again consistent with the statement that he gave the police in which he gave a description of the lock that was used.[^14]

41     The accused claimed that he did not splash the red coloured paint. The door was already splashed with paint when he arrived at the scene. The accused claimed that he never had any intention of splashing pain on the unit. He sought to explain the photograph of the red paint in the WhatsApp application chat[^15] between “David” and himself as a ruse to lead “David” to believe that he, the accused, would be carrying out “David’s” directions. His explanation was that he had first decided to only take a photograph of a can of paint and pretend that he had purchased it but later proceeded to actually purchase a can of red paint just in case “David” requested proof of purchase. Conveniently, the accused threw away the paint and the receipt.

42     I have reviewed his version of events. I disbelieved him. His story is far-fetched. It was, in my mind, internally inconsistent. To believe his version would mean believing that the accused had gone through the entire charade to deceive ‘David”, someone that he had never met, that he was going to do something that he had no intention to do. It would have been very much simpler to have told “David” that he was not going to splash any paint, like he did when he was asked to do the same for the Wellington Circle unit.

43     I also found that the accused’s version of events in this regard to be externally inconsistent.

> (a)     the accused was paid differing amounts for the two jobs. This was $150 for the Wellington Circle unit and $250 for the Woodlands Drive unit. This differential can be explained by the fact that the accused was required to perform an additional task at the Woodlands Drive unit, namely, the splashing of the red paint;

> (b)     PW10 had confirmed that there was no red paint on the door when he left that unit earlier that day. Neither was there any paint when his wife left the unit at about 2000 hrs.[^16] The Investigation Officer, PW4, informed the court that, as part of his investigations into the Woodlands Drive incident, he had also retrieved the POLCAM footages for Block 623. In particular, the footage was reviewed from the time PW10’s wife was said to have left home to after 2150 hrs. Only the accused was seen to be acting suspiciously during this period;[^17]

> (c)     Upon his arrest, the accused admitted to the splashing of the red paint in both his long and cautioned statements[^18]. His claim that the red paint was already there when he reached the Woodlands Drive unit was never raised; and

> (d)     PW11 confirmed that the accused had returned to the unit after the incident and apologised to him _specifically_ for both the acts of splashing the paint and for placing the lock around the metal gate.[^19] At no time did the accused tell or suggest to PW11 that the red paint had been splashed by someone else.

44     Taking the evidence in totality, I have no doubt that the accused, in addition to placing the bicycle lock (without engaging the lock) around the metal gate at the Woodlands Drive unit, also splashed paint onto the door and gate of the unit. I found the accused’s version of events at \[41\] above, was not only incredulous, but also disingenuous. I agreed with the prosecution that his explanation appeared to be an afterthought.

45     As highlighted by the prosecution[^20], the most damning is the evidence of PW11 that the accused had apologised to him for both acts of harassment. Although PW11 was a victim, he did not have a reason to falsify his evidence. He has been supportive of the accused and had even attended court sessions with the accused after he was charged.[^21]

46     All considered, I was satisfied that the accused committed both acts of harassment at the Woodlands Drive unit.

### Threats made by “David”

47     The accused claims that the reason why he went through with the acts was because of the threats made by “David”. I reviewed these alleged threats and took them with a large pinch of salt. At the end of the day, I was not convinced that these threats compelled the accused to commit the acts in question, if in fact there were any threats at all.

48     First, the supposed alleged threats are vague. As the accused himself told the court, there was no specificity in the threat. It was simply that “someone” would come down to do “something”.[^22] In the accused’s own closing submissions, he concedes that he _“…… locked the gate and took a picture …. ”_ because he was _pestered_ to do so. Furthermore, these supposed threats were never made face to face. Therefore, objectively, the vagueness of the threats and the manner in which they were conveyed was, in my view, insufficient for it to amount to threats that compelled the accused into doing these acts.

49     Second is that these allegations are also not borne out by the objective evidence, namely the screenshot of the WhatsApp application messages that were retrieved from P15, the accused’s handphone for the period between 1520 hrs on 16 December 2018 to 2317 hrs on 17 December 2018. There is not an iota of a threat in the numerous messages from “David”. He did not force the accused to do any job. For example, “David” asked the accused whether he wanted to do a job, to which the accused readily said “ok” without any prompting and the accused even asked how much paint he would need.[^23]

50     The accused’s claim of being in a panic and his reluctance to do the assigned jobs is not borne out by the video footages shown. The video footages show him arriving at the lift lobbies of both the Wellington Circle and Woodlands Drive units wearing a cap pulled down low, obscuring his face.

51     At the lift lobby of the Wellington Circle unit, the accused appeared to have walked beyond the view of the camera until the lift car arrived. He then proceeded to walk calmly into the lift car. At the lift lobby of the Woodlands Drive unit, the accused can also be seen walking calmly into the lift car. There was no sign of panic whatsoever. When his acts or harassment were completed, the video footage of the staircases leading to the ground floor of the Blocks 507B Wellington Circle and 623 Woodlands Drive both showed the accused walking calmly down the staircase and towards the MRT station.

52     What I also found curious was the cap the accused was wearing when he committed the acts of harassment. In particular, when he committed the acts of harassment at the Woodlands Drive unit. This occurred at night. There was no need for cap. What I saw was a person, being aware of the presence of cameras at the lift lobbies, deliberately trying hide his identity by wearing a cap pulled low down his face.

53     I therefore adjudged that, in fact, no threats were made by “David”. The WhatsApp messages show that the accused readily accepted the jobs given to him without much hesitation. I agreed with the characterization by the prosecution that the accused _“exercised the conscious choice to perform the jobs assigned to him and was motivated to do so because of money”.[^24]_ Upon accepting the jobs, the accused perform them deliberately, methodically and calmly.

### Statements made to the police

54     The accused had provided two cautioned statements and one long statement to the police. Although the accused did not raise any issue that there any threat, inducement or promise during the taking of the statements, he appeared to question the accuracy of the statements. He claimed that he no recollection of the providing the statements, and that he had signed the statements unthinkingly as he wanted to be bailed out and simply did what he was asked. I did not accept his explanation.

55     First, procedure-wise, I accepted that the proper procedures had been complied with in the recording of the statements. The accused spoke English and was fully aware of the seriousness of the charges he was facing. I was incredulous that the accused said that he signed the statement without knowing what he was signing.[^25]

56     Second, I found it extremely strange that despite his claims of signing the statements unthinkingly, the accused’s evidence in court is strikingly similar to what was recorded in the statements, in particular the acts of harassment that he has been accused of. The only real difference the splashing of the red paint in the Woodlands Drive incident.

57     All considered, I found that his attempt to cast doubt on the accuracy of the statements is simply another disingenuous attempt to distance himself from the incriminating portions of his statements. I am of the view that what was recorded in the statement, in particular, his long statement, was an accurate description on what happened that day.

## Decision at the close of trial

58     Having considered the evidence before the court, I am of the view that the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable double. I found that:

> (a)     that the accused knew that he was working for an illegal moneylender named “David” when he committed the acts of harassment as described in the charges at the Wellington Circle unit and the Woodlands Drive unit;

> (b)     at the Wellington Circle unit, the accused fastened the main gate of the flat with a bicycle lock and leaving a debtor’s note on the shoe rack, and in doing so, was likely to cause alarm to the unit’s occupant, PW9; and

> (c)     at the Woodlands Drive unit, the accused fastened the main gate of the flat with a bicycle lock and splashed red-coloured paint at the main door of the unit, and in doing so, was likely to cause alarm to the unit’s occupant, PW10.

59     Accordingly, I found the accused guilty and convicted him on the two proceeded charges.

60     Having convicted the accused, I enquired with the prosecution as to the status of the stood down charge, namely MAC-900504-2018. This related to a charge under s 103(5)(c) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) for the accused’s failure to attend court on 17 September 2019 pursuant to his conditions of bail. The prosecution offered to have this charge taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.

61     The accused accepted the offer. He admitted and consented to this charge being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.

## Antecedents and submissions on sentence

62     The accused has no antecedents.

63     The prosecution made oral submissions on sentence. In summary, the prosecution submitted the following sentences and had no objection if the court ordered that the sentences to run concurrently:

> (a)      the Wellington Circle incident:

>> 3 months’ imprisonment; and

> (b)      the Woodlands Drive incident:

>> 12 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane

64     The accused had tendered a written plea in mitigation. It can be found as part of his closing submission. He highlighted his clean record and his various acts of community service, including volunteering of teacher at his alma mater and as a frontline worker during the COVID-19 pandemic. He assisted taking care of infected patients at the Singapore Expo. He is presently a swabber with the Health Promotion Board.

65     The accused also informed the court that he hopes to carry on his education and hopes to complete his final year of his undergraduate studies at NTU. He expressed his desire to become a teacher in the future and is concerned that, with this conviction, he will never become a teacher.

## Sentencing Considerations

### The punishment prescribed by law and benchmark sentence

66     I first set out the punishment prescribed by law. For an offence under s 28(1)(b) of the Moneylender Act, the punishment prescribed by law is a sentence of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years’ imprisonment and a discretionary fine of not less than $5,000 and not more than $50,000 for a first offender. In addition, where it has been proved to the satisfaction of the court that, in the course of committing this offence, damage was caused to any property, caning of not less than 3 strokes and not more than 6 stokes.

67     With regard to non-fire harassment cases, I note that the High Court in _Public Prosecutor v Nelson Jayaraj s/o Chandran_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 2 SLR 1130</span> (“_Nelson Jayaraj_”) at \[47\], has stated that the benchmark sentence for non-fire harassment cases with property damage is 12 months imprisonment and three strokes of the cane.

### The Woodlands Drive unit (DAC-942884-2018)

68     I will first deal with the acts of harassment committed by the accused vis-à-vis the Woodlands Drive unit. The acts involved the using a bicycle lock to fasten the main gate and the splashing of red paint on the main door.

69     The prosecution had submitted a sentence of which is in line with the benchmark sentence in _Nelson Jayaraj_. I concurred with the prosecution that this would be an appropriate sentence. I saw no reason to depart from the benchmark sentence.

70     In the present case, although the accused did not specifically plead that his financial situation caused him to work for the illegal moneylender in his plea in mitigation, I note that this was what he had stated in court and in his statement to the police. I was therefore prepared to give him a benefit of a doubt and accepted that he committed these acts because of his financial situational. However, I did not think that this warranted any reduction in the sentence. For example, in _Quek Li Hao v Public Prosecutor_ \[2013\] 3 SGHC 152 _(“Quek Li Hao”_), the High Court likewise sentenced the accused to 12 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane despite the fact that the accused fell into the “genuine financial need” category.

### The Wellington Circle unit (DAC-941427-2018)

71     For the Wellington Circle unit, I note that that no property damage was caused. It is not disputed that the accused did not fasten the lock around the unit’s metal. The prosecution’s sentencing submission of six months’ imprisonment was, in my view, entirely fair and appropriate.

## Sentence imposed

72     All considered, I agreed with the sentencing submission of the prosecution in this instant. According, I imposed the following sentences on the accused:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="44.12%"> <col width="55.88%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge Number</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentence Imposed</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-942884-2018</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">12 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-941427-2018</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

### Consecutive or concurrent sentences

73     As the accused was convicted of two charges, the court had a discretion as to whether to run the two sentences of imprisonment consecutively. For a start, to order them to run consecutively would not have violated the “one-transaction” rule as the two offences, although similar in nature, were committed seven hours apart, in different parts of Singapore and on different residential units.

74     However, the prosecution informed the court, rightly again in my view, that they were not seeking consecutive sentences. It was submitted a global sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane was appropriate in the present case. One of the reasons cited was that the prosecution had considered the steps taken by the accused in mitigating the inconvenience caused to the occupants by simply fastening the bicycle lock around the metal gate without engaging the lock. I agreed with this submission.

75     The accused was remorseful for his acts. This could be seen by his attempt to right what he did by apologising to the victims of both the units after the incident and offering to make good what he had done. It was apparent that his sincerity was genuine as PW11 forgave him and proceeded to give him moral support at a few court mentions.

76     I was of the view that if I were to order both sentences to run consecutively, the result would be a sentence imposed that be overly harsh in the circumstances. Accordingly, I ordered the two sentences of imprisonment to run concurrently. Therefore, the total sentence imposed on the accused is 12 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane.

77     The accused, being dissatisfied with the conviction and the sentence I have imposed now appeals against both conviction and sentence. The accused is presently on bail pending the outcome of this appeal.
