### District Judge Kaur Jasvender:

1       The accused was convicted after a trial on the following charge:

> are charged that you, on the 17th day of September 2017, at or about 12.48pm, in the vicinity of the central refuse chute at Block 759 Woodlands Avenue 6, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Randy Lee Teck Choon (M/42) by means of an instrument for cutting, _to wit_, by using a penknife with a blade measuring about 7cm in length to slash the said Randy Lee Teck Choon once on his chest, causing him to sustain a linear vertical superficial laceration measuring 22cm in length on his chest, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 324 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

She was sentenced to four months’ imprisonment. She has brought this appeal only against the conviction.

## Prosecution’s case

2       The prosecution called nine witnesses. Three of them were formal witnesses. The evidence of the six other witnesses is summarised below.

#### (i) Evidence of PW1 – Randy Lee Teck Choon (‘the victim’)

3       The victim got married in 2002. His divorce was finalised in June 2018 because he had an affair with the accused. The affair started from the end of 2015. He was then about 40 years of age. The accused was 20 years of age.

4       He came to know the accused in 2015 when she worked at his company which sold corporate gifts and souvenirs under the name of Trivax Trading Pte Ltd (‘Trivax’). The accused initially worked as a part-timer to distribute leaflets for a project. Later, she was employed as a full-time employee in the sales department. Subsequently, the accused’s services were terminated by the victim’s partner. He estimated that the accused worked at Trivax for about three to six months.

5       After the accused left in 2016, she opened up her own firm, J&M Trading Pte Ltd, which also dealt with corporate gifts and souvenirs. The victim mentored the accused and he also had business dealings with her.

6       A few days after the 2017 Chinese New Year, which was on 28 and 29 January 2017, he told the accused that he wanted to end their relationship. He told her over the telephone and in text messages. He said he wanted to break-up because the accused was pestering him to go with her for house visits during the Chinese New Year and to divorce his wife.

7       He broke-up with the accused in February 2017. He said the accused was angry and did not agree to the break-up. However, he did not change his mind. However, he continued to have contact with the accused but said his relationship with her thereafter was as a friend and business associate.

8       After the break-up, he went to the accused’s house twice for dinner with the accused’s grandparents and siblings. He said the accused’s grandparents had requested him to join them for dinner. He said they were unaware of the break-up. He also celebrated the accused’s birthday which is on 9th July at Fort Canning Hotel.

9       Around May 2017, the accused intended to start a sleepwear business and wanted to meet suppliers in China to obtain material for the sleepwear. She asked him to go with her to China to meet the suppliers. He declined to do so as he was trying to save his marriage and was also financially broke. However, the accused went ahead and bought the air-tickets and arranged the accommodation. The victim refused to go on the trip. The accused then wanted him to pay the full sum of both air-tickets and the accommodation which was around $600 plus. He agreed to pay her but did not do so because he did not have the means. He told the accused over the telephone and texted her that he was unable to pay on a few occasions.

10     The accused was unhappy that he did not pay her. She insisted that he fulfil his promise to pay her the full sum. A few days before 17 September 2017, he suggested to the accused to meet to discuss how to settle the issue. He said he had planned to pay for his own share of the air-ticket price and accommodation or to pay the full sum by instalments.

11     He testified that the accused had also asked him to get back together a few times. However, he declined because the accused wanted him to divorce his wife. He said he has two children and he wanted to be with his ex-wife. He told the accused his reason but she was unable to accept it.

12     On 13 August 2017, the victim’s ex-wife made a police report against the accused for harassment (see exh D1). The victim was in in Thailand when she made the report. On 25 Aug 2017, the victim made a police report at Ang Mo Kio Police Station because the accused kept on harassing and pestering him and his family. He said he was trying to avoid contact with the accused. However, the accused kept calling and messaging him on WhatsApp and went to the temple that he goes to. The accused was also able to track him at his parents place. On 1 Sept 2017, he made another police report at Ang Mo Kio Police station.

13     On 17 September 2017, between 10 to 11am, he picked the accused up in his car from her house at Block 795 Woodlands Avenue 6 to have lunch at Bukit Timah Shopping Centre. After the lunch, he sent her back. The accused sat at the front passenger seat. In the car, they spoke about the air ticket issue. The accused insisted that he must pay her the full sum. He told her that he could not afford the full amount. However, she continued to insist that he must pay her. She also wanted him to get back together with her. She asked him twice in the car to get back together but he declined.

14     He said the accused was angry, frustrated and cried. She slapped him about five times on his left cheek whilst he was driving. The victim was angry but he did not stop the car. He was worried that if he stopped the car, she may slap him more or open the car door and run out.

15     He continued to drive to the accused’s block. The accused then took out a penknife and started to scratch the window of the car. She was crying whilst doing so. The victim felt that she was emotionally unstable. He felt threatened on seeing the penknife. He was afraid the accused may slash him. He did not say anything and continued to drive.

16     After a car ride of about 20 to 30 minutes, he arrived at the accused’s block. He stopped the car near the rubbish chute. He came out of the car and went over to the accused’s side and opened the door. He asked her to get out. She was holding the pen knife and scratching the window of the car. He said that she stopped scratching but was still holding onto the pen knife. She refused to get out of the car and was angry. He asked her a few times to get out. She raised her voice and did not want to get out. He repeatedly asked her to get out. After about 5 minutes, she came out.

17     When the accused got out, they were both standing on the pavement. The accused was holding the penknife in her hand and waiving it in front of him. The blade was out. The victim stepped back in fear. He said the accused appeared frustrated, sad, angry, and was also crying. She was shouting and asking him to make full payment for the China trip. He told her that he could not. She also asked him to go for the trip and get together with her. He told her ‘no’. In frustration, the accused took one step forward and slashed him with the pen knife on the left side of his chest.

18     The victim was shocked and fell to the ground. He heard the accused exclaim ‘Oh, my God’. He was in pain and felt cold. He saw a lot of blood was coming out from his chest. He saw the penknife on the ground. A few people came to his assistance. He agreed that the accused called her sister to bring down a piece of cloth. He said that someone put a shirt underneath his head to raise it and someone gave him a piece of cloth to press on the wound to stop the bleeding. Subsequently, he was taken by an ambulance to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital.

19     He circled the area where he was standing on the pavement before he was slashed in photograph P8-1. He confirmed that the penknife used by the accused is seen in photograph P8-6. He stated the yellow cloth in photograph P8-7 was used to press on his wound and the jeans jacket was placed under his head.

20     He confirmed that photograph P9 shows the slash wound on his left chest. The photograph was taken whilst he was in the ambulance. Photograph P10 shows the wound after it had been stitched. It was taken at the police station on the following day. He now has a permanent scar on his chest.

21     He confirmed that the information in the medical report (exh P1) is correct. He declined to be warded at the hospital and did not want a medical certificate.

22     Under cross-examination, the victim disagreed that the accused had threatened to kill herself with the penknife. He agreed that he told the accused that he never wanted to see her again.

#### (ii) Evidence of PW2 – Izaini Bin Ismail (‘Izaini’)

23     On 17 September 2017, sometime before 12.40pm, Izaini was at the third floor of Block 757 Woodlands Avenue 6. He was helping his mother and sister to carry things as they were moving house. He stated that their unit was facing the bin centre of Block 759.

24     Whilst he was at the third floor, he heard a woman raising her voice. He looked down and saw that she was with a man. He said they were standing facing each other and were less than one arm’s length apart.

25     Shortly thereafter he went down to the block to push some items. When he came down, he said the accused was still raising her voice. He said the victim was just standing and he did not hear his voice.

26     As Izaini was pushing the items, he saw the victim had fallen to the ground between the car and the kerb and was holding his chest. He indicated the position where the victim was on the ground with an asterisk in photograph P8-1. Izaini rushed over to assist. He saw the victim had a slash wound on the chest through the torn shirt.

27     Izaini decided to move the victim’s car as he felt that the victim was being squeezed between the car and the kerb. He said the key was still in the ignition hole.

28     He stated the accused was standing nearby. He asked her what had happened. She told him that it was an accident and she did not do it on purpose. He observed that the accused appeared to be in a state of shock.

29     He saw the accused had a handbag on her right shoulder and was holding a jacket. He asked her if she had a towel. She told him that she did not. He then asked her for her jacket in order to cover the wound and to press on it to stop the flow of blood. He took the jacket which was over her left hand. He then saw the accused dropping a penknife from her right hand. He marked the area where she dropped the penknife with a circle in photograph P8-1.

30     He stated that the accused telephoned her sister to come down with a towel and water. He identified the penknife, the jacket which he took from the accused and the yellow cloth which the accused’s sister brought down to be shown in photograph P8-6.

31     At about 12.48pm, Izaini called the police (see exh P7).

#### (iii) Evidence of PW3 – Sergeant Edward Sin Zhi Chao (‘Sgt Edward’)

32     Sgt Edward and his partner, Staff Sergent Muhammad Fawzey Bin Karimghani were despatched to attend to the first information report (P7). They arrived at the scene at about 1.05pm.

33     He spotted the victim lying on the service road near to the central rubbish chute of Block 759 Woodlands Avenue 6. The ambulance was already at the scene. He observed a denim jacket and yellow towel were beside the victim. He established that the jacket and yellow towel had been used to cover the victim’s slash wound on his chest which could be seen through the shirt which was torn at the site of the injury. He noticed that the victim was in pain and out of breath.

34     He testified that the accused was squatting beside the victim. He brought her to the side for an interview. He said the accused appeared to be in a state of shock. She told him that she had a dispute with the victim and had threatened to end her life by placing a penknife on her wrist. This resulted in a scuffle. During the scuffle, the penknife had slashed the victim on his chest. Sgt Edward asked where the penknife was. The accused then took it out from her handbag and surrendered it.

35     Sgt Edward took seven photographs at the scene (P8-1 to P8-7) and seized the penknife, jacket and yellow towel.

#### (iv) Evidence of PW4 – Staff Sergeant Muhammad Fawzey Bin Karimghani (“SSgt Fawzey’)

36     SSgt Fawzey took a photograph of the slash wound whilst the victim was in the ambulance (see P9).

#### (v) Evidence of PW7 – Dr Lee Hisao Wen (‘Dr Lee’)

37     Dr Lee was a medical officer at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital when she examined the victim on 17 September 2017. He told her that he had been slashed on his chest with a penknife by his ex-girlfriend.

38     Dr Lee described the injury to be a ‘linear vertical superficial laceration on the left side of the chest’. The laceration was 22cm long. Dr Lee stated that the length of the wound was quite long. She stated that the depth of the wound was 0.5cm and it was considered as superficial. However, it was bleeding and she considered that it was ‘deep enough … to stitch up the wound’. She spent quite a while to stich the wound as it required 29 stitches. Dr Lee opined that the wound was likely to leave a permanent scar as it was long and required stitching.

#### (vi) Evidence of PW8 – Station Inspector Nur Aisah Bte Azman (‘SI Nur Aisah’)

39     On 13 February 2019, SI Nur Aisah took measurements of the blade of the penknife (exh P4) and a photograph of it (see P10). The blade is 7cm in length.

#### (vii) Evidence of Assistant Superintendent Seah Woe Siong, Melvin (‘ASP Seah’)

40     On 18 September 2017, ASP Seah took a photograph of the wound after it had been sutured (see P11).

41     Under cross-examination, ASP Seah stated that he observed that the accused was ‘down’ and sad over the incident.

## Prima facie case

42     The threshold for calling the defence of the accused was clearly established. The two courses were explained to her. She elected to give evidence. She did not call any witness.

## Defence case

43     The accused runs a business dealing with corporate gifts and souvenirs.

44     In June 2016, she came to know the victim when she worked as a part-time flyer distributor at Trivax. In July 2016, she became a full-time employee. At the end of July 2016, she stopped working as she developed an eye infection.

45     In late July or August 2016, she got into a relationship with the victim. The victim suggested to her to set-up her own business of corporate gifts. She agreed. In October 2016, she started J&M Trading Private Limited. The victim taught her how to run the business.

46     About three months later, she introduced him to her grandparents and sister. She stated that he had dinner frequently with her siblings and grandparents. He also joined them on festive occasions.

47     She testified that the victim visited her during Chinese New Year 2017. They also celebrated Valentine’s Day. In June 2017, the victim told her that he has financial issues. They had frequent quarrels as a result. In July 2017, she celebrated her birthday with the victim.

48     In July 2017, she suggested to the victim to go to Guangzhou with her to source for factories for sleepwear and new products. She said that they intended to do the sleepwear business together. The victim agreed to go for the trip and she booked two tickets online. She said the victim was with her when she made payment at an AXS machine at People’s Park Centre.

49     In September 2017, she showed the victim various places where they could stay at. She said he selected a place. She then booked the accommodation. About one week before the incident, the victim told her repeatedly that he has no money and he could not go with her for the trip. He also told her that he did not want his wife to use the trip as evidence against him. However, she insisted that he should go. She told him that she had already paid for the tickets and accommodation. As he did not back down, she asked him to repay her the full amount as he had initially agreed to go. The victim told her that he was unable to pay but eventually repaid her $600 plus for the air tickets before 17 September 2017. She stated that he still owed her $500 plus for the accommodation. She stated that they argued a lot in the week prior to 17 September 2017 about cancelling the trip.

50     On 17 September 2017, the victim suggested a meet-up to discuss the trip. He came to fetch her for a meal at Bukit Timah Plaza. She wanted to convince him to go. He told her that he was unable to go. He claimed that he could not find his passport. She was very upset as she was looking forward to meeting the factory owners. She stated that they quarrelled non-stop about the trip.

51     On the way back in the car, the quarrel was ‘very heated’. She said they were both shouting. She said that the victim said ‘nasty’ things like he totally regretted getting together with her and he did not ever want to see her again. She said that this broke her heart because she loved him. She claimed that the victim also pushed her head against the window and she did likewise. She added that we “both exchanged physical stuff on each other”.

52     When they arrived at her block, the victim parked his car near the rubbish centre. She refused to alight as she knew that it was the end of their relationship and she would not be able to contact the victim again. She said that she did not want to lose the victim as ‘losing him was like losing my world’. She took out a penknife from her stationary pouch and told the victim ‘If you don’t stop quarrelling, I’ll cut myself. I’ll kill myself.’ She believed that the victim would tell her not to hurt herself but he did not. Instead, they continued quarrelling and he told her that he did not want to see her again. In order to hold back from hurting herself, she scratched the window of the car a few times.

53     After about five minutes, the victim alighted from the car. He opened the passenger door. He threw her handbag, jacket and laptop out of the car. He then dragged her out of the car. She stated that their quarrel did not stop but became more heated. She said, ‘And everything happened in a flash. Then I saw blood and the knife was still in my hand.’

54     She stated that the victim contacted her after the incident. In December 2017, she celebrated the victim’s birthday. On 13 February 2019, she went to the zoo with him. From July 2019, they ceased having contact.

## Findings

55     The accused completed her polytechnic studies in May 2016. She started working part-time for the victim and his partner in June 2016. She became a full-time employee in July 2016. I find that the victim was mistaken when he said that the accused became a part-time employee in 2015. The accused left the employment at the end of July 2016.

56     It was not in dispute that the accused and the victim maintained contact thereafter and entered into a relationship. The victim stated that he broke up with the accused sometime in February 2017. The accused disputed this. According to her, they both had said they would break up many times but they always got back together. I did not find the conflict in evidence on whether there was a relationship break up to be material. This is because the accused and the victim still maintained contact up until the day of the incident.

57     It was not in dispute that the accused had bought the air tickets and booked accommodation for the victim and herself for a trip to Guangzhou which was to take place on the day after the incident. According to the accused, the trip was booked sometime in July 2017. She claimed that the trip was booked with the consent of the victim but he backed off subsequently. On the other hand, the victim claimed that the trip was booked without his consent. In my view, the issue of whether the trip was booked with or without the victim’s consent is irrelevant. The fact of the matter is that the victim had told the accused repeatedly that he was not agreeable to go at least one week before the incident.

58     The accused insisted that the victim must go on the trip or reimburse her the cost. They had frequent quarrels about the victim’s decision not to go which started at least one week prior to the incident. The accused stated that the victim repaid her the cost of the air tickets but did not pay her the accommodation cost. She gave the following answers under cross-examination with regard to her state of mind during the week before the incident[^1]:

> QYou were upset that Randy did not want to go to China with you, right?

> AYes.

> QAnd you were upset for this for---since---would you agree with me at least 1 week before 17th September 2017?

> AYes.

> QYou were also angry, right?

> AYes.

> QYou were even angrier because Randy would rather pay you the money for the tickets which is 600 plus than to go to China with you, right?

> ANo. I’m angry because the trip was already booked, why is he wasting it like that.

> QPrecisely. Precisely, he did not want to go with you, he would rather waste the tickets, he would rather pay you 600 plus for nothing, just not to go. That made you even angrier, right?

> AThat made me very frustrated.

> QDoesn’t that also include that it made you angrier?

> AWasn’t so much about being angry but more about very frustrated.

59     On the day of the incident, the victim went to fetch the accused to have lunch. She was asked[^2]: “You were upset because he didn’t want to go with you that’s why you had to meet on 17th September, wasn’t it?” She answered: “Yes.” It was not in dispute that the victim maintained that he did not want to go for the trip. After the lunch, he sent the accused back to her house.

60     The accused sat in the front passenger seat. It was not in dispute that the accused took out the penknife whilst she was in the car. It was her evidence that she took out the penknife as a ploy to threaten to hurt herself in the hope that the victim will ask her not to do so. However, the victim did not. She admitted that she then scratched the front passenger window of the car a few times with the penknife.

61     As to how she alighted from the car, the accused claimed that the victim threw her laptop, handbag and jacket out and dragged her by the hand. She claimed that the victim took all three items at one go and threw them. The accused was unable to state where the three items were prior to the victim allegedly throwing them. She gave the following answers:

>   
| 

Court:

 | 

So where had you placed these items in the car?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

I don’t remember exactly, but there could have only been 2 places which is either my lap or on the---the foot area.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

So you can’t recall whether these 3 items were on your lap or on the, as you put it, the foot area.

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Yes. They can only be these 2 places.

 |

  
  

I found it hard to believe that the accused was unable to recollect where the items were placed if the victim had indeed taken and thrown them. It was also unbelievable that the accused would have meekly allowed the victim to take the items when she was refusing to alight. I accepted the victim’s evidence that he did not throw the items and he did not pull the accused out by her hand as she had a penknife in her hand.

62     The mens rea for an offence of hurt as defined in section 321 of the Penal Code is either intention or knowledge. As there cannot be direct proof in the absence of an admission, the intent or knowledge is to be inferred from the nature of the act and the circumstances.

63     As for the nature of the act, the victim suffered a linear vertical laceration on the left side of his chest. The laceration was 22cm long. It required 29 stitches. The injury is seen in the photograph taken after it was stitched up.

![]([2020] SGDC 0047_Image/[2020] SGDC 0047_image1.png)

64     It involved a downward motion with sustained contact to cause the long laceration which required suturing. The accused gave no explanation on how the injury was inflicted. She claimed that ‘everything happened in a flash’. Under cross-examination, although she claimed that she was unable to remember the exact moment, she admitted that she slashed the victim once on his chest. Her answers were as follows[^3]:

> QI’ll just help to refresh your memory, okay. So, PW2 Izaini says that during that argument, he could only hear you shouting. He couldn’t hear what the man you were with, he couldn’t hear his voice at all. So, you were very angry, right?

> AYes, I was angry.

> QTherefore, you were shouting at Randy, weren’t you?

> AHe shouted at me first.

> QYou were---answer the question. You were shouting at Randy, weren’t you?

> AYes.

> QYou were so angry with Randy, weren’t you?

> AYes.

> QYour evidence is that, everything then happened in a flash, right?

> AYes.

> QBy this, you mean that you then slashed Randy with the penknife, right?

> AAll I remember was it happened in a flash, then I saw blood, then the penknife was still in my hand. That means I must have done it.

> QDo you remember slashing Randy on the chest?

> AI don’t remember the exact moment. My whole mind went blank. The quarrel was so heated.

> QI’m asking you, you agree that you slashed Randy on the chest with the penknife, right? Yes or no?

> AYes.

> QYou remember doing it, you remember slashing him on the chest, right?

> AI don’t remember the exact moment and how but, yes, I remember like it happened.

> QSo, you agree with me? You remember slashing Randy on the chest, right?

> AYes.

> QYou just slashed him one time only, right?

> AYes, once.

65     The accused claimed that the victim taunted her and she appeared to suggest that she lost control because of grave and sudden provocation. Asked what precisely the victim said before she slashed him, she gave the following answer[^4]:

>   
| 

Court:

 | 

Are you able to tell us what precisely did either you, or Randy, or both of you said just prior to the slashing happening. What was being said?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

It was along the lines of how he regretted being with me and never wanted to see me again. And then he talked about superstition. He said he---he said people who said that dragons will get together with---a dragon together with mouse is good, is stupid or something like that, because his Chinese zodiac is a dragon and I’m a mouse. So, he is---he is very superstitious and believes in those. So, he said he regrets believing in that also.

 |

  
  

66     There is an objective requirement that the provocation must be ‘grave and sudden’ which involves the application of the ‘reasonable man’ test, i.e., whether an ordinary person of the same sex and age as the accused, sharing her characteristics as would affect the gravity of the provocation and placed in the same situation, would have been so provoked as to lose her self-control (see _Pathip Selvan s/o Sugumaran v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 4 SLR 453</span>).

67     I was not satisfied that objective test of provocation was met. The victim had every right to breakup with the accused. In my view, the fact that the victim said he never wanted to see her again, that he regrets getting together with her, and that he should not have believed in the Chinese zodiac did not qualify as triggers to objectively amount to ‘grave’ provocation.

68     On the evidence of the accused, on the way back in the car, the victim had said that he did not want to see her again. She thus already knew that she was unlikely to see the victim again. She had her wits about her and took out the penknife in a ploy to hurt herself in an attempt to salvage her relationship. She gave the following answers in cross-examination[^5]:

>   
| 

Q

 | 

You knew and you were thinking you may not see Randy again after 17th September, right?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

You therefore could see coming that he wanted to break-up with you, right?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

You therefore wanted to do something to stop the quarrel, correct?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

You really wanted to salvage the relationship with Randy, didn’t you?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, you thought of an idea, right?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

You thought of a way to make him stop arguing with you, give in to you and care for you, correct?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes, hopefully.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Yes. And that was why when you were in the car, you took out the penknife, correct?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

…

 |

Q

 | 

In fact, you knew that if you got out of that car at that time, you’ll never see Randy again, right?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

That is because you knew at that time that Randy clearly didn’t want the relationship with you anymore, correct?

 |
| 

A

 | 

From the way he said his words, yes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Sorry. What he said in his words?

 |
| 

A

 | 

From the way he said his words, yes.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

So what do you mean by that, “from the way he said his words, yes”?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

He said “I never want to see you again.”

69     When the ploy failed and the victim did not relent, she did not place the penknife in her handbag or retract its blade. On her account, she was very frustrated at the victim because he did not want to go with her on the trip. She was the only one who was heard shouting at the pavement by Izaini.

70     I find that the accused did not lose her self-control but slashed the victim quite deliberately as seen from the long laceration which required sustained pressure. Shortly after the incident, she had the presence of mind to tell Izaini it was an accident. When interviewed by Sgt Edmund at the scene, she fabricated a story that she placed the penknife at her wrist and the victim was slashed in the course of a scuffle.

71     Accordingly, I was satisfied that the charge was proved beyond a reasonable doubt and convicted the accused.
