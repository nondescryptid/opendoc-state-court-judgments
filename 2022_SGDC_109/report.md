### Senior District Judge Ong Hian Sun:

## Introduction

1       The Accused claimed trial to a charge of trafficking in a controlled drug (“trafficking charge” – DAC 931361 of 2019) under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“**MDA**”) relating to the trafficking of methamphetamine :

> “You…are charged that you, on 7 November 2019, at about 1.10 a.m., at the car park of Block 375 Hougang Street 31, Singapore, did traffic in a Class A Controlled Drug listed in The First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), by having in your possession for the purpose of trafficking, _to wit_, one packet of crystalline substance containing not less than 123.9 grams of crystalline substance, which was analysed and found to contain not less than 82.59 grams of methamphetamine, without any authorisation under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 5(1)(a) read with Section 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed),

> and further, that you, before the commission of the said offence, were on 13 October 2004 in Court 3 of the District Court, _vide_ DAC32238/2004, convicted of an offence for trafficking in a controlled drug by having in possession a controlled drug for the purpose of trafficking, _to wit_, nimetazepam, under Section 5(1)(a) read with Section 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Chapter 185, 2001 Rev Ed) and punished under Section 33(1) of the said Act with 2 years’ imprisonment and 2 strokes of the cane, which conviction and punishment have not been set aside to date, and you shall now be punished under Section 33(4A)(i) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2001 Rev Ed).”

2       At the close of the trial I convicted him on the trafficking charge. He then pleaded guilty to six charges which were stood down pending the trial, namely two charges of consumption of a controlled drug (DAC 942827 of 2018 & DAC 908865 of 2020) and three charges of possession of a controlled drug (DAC 939655 of 2018, DAC 939656 of 2018 & DAC 931362 of 2019) and one charge of attempting to enter a casino by pretending to be some other person (MAC 911016 of 2019). He consented to have 7 other remaining charges relating to possession of a controlled drug to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

3       He was sentenced to 12 years 6 months’ imprisonment with 10 strokes of the cane for his trafficking charge, mandatory minimum imprisonment of 3 years for each of his two respective consumption charges, mandatory minimum imprisonment of 2 years for each of his three respective possession charges and a fine of $2000 in default 1 week imprisonment for his charge under the Casino Control Act. The sentences for the trafficking charge and one consumption charge and one possession charge were ordered to run consecutively, leading to a global sentence of 17 years and 6 months’ imprisonment with 10 strokes of the cane and a fine of $2000.

4       The Accused has appealed against his conviction on the trafficking charge and the global sentence imposed.

## The Prosecution’s case

5       On 7 November 2019 at around 1.10 a.m., the Accused was arrested at the car park of Block 375 Hougang Street 31, Singapore, and found to be in possession of one blue plastic bag containing one clear plastic packet of white crystalline substance (“the Drugs”).

6       Prior to his arrest, the Accused had been placing orders for drugs with one “Ah Boy”. The Accused was to make payment by passing money to Ah Boy’s couriers when the couriers delivered the drugs to the Accused at a pre-arranged meeting point. Sometime on the night of 6 November 2019, Edgar Toh Jun Hao (“Edgar”), a courier who worked for Ah Boy, received instructions from Ah Boy to deliver “25s” to a customer at the “Esso” petrol station along Upper Serangoon Road. “25s” refers to 125 grams of methamphetamine. On 7 November 2019 at around 1.00 a.m., the Accused reached the “Esso” petrol station along Upper Serangoon Road where he spotted a black Mercedes car (the “car”). Edgar and another courier working for Ah Boy, Tan Jian Hong, Malcolm (“Malcolm”), were in the car. The Accused boarded the car.

7       While in the car, the Accused handed over $2,200 in cash to Edgar, which was to be passed on to Ah Boy. In return, the Accused received the Drugs from Edgar[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1). The Drugs which were in crystalline form were contained in a clear ziplock packet and placed in a blue plastic bag[^2]. Thereafter, the Accused left the car and was seen approaching a vehicle bearing registration plate number SJP6515P.

8       On the same day, at around 1.10 a.m., the vehicle SJP6516P was intercepted by CNB officers at the carpark of Block 375 Hougang Street 31, Singapore. Accused was placed on arrest and a search was conducted on the Accused and the blue plastic bag containing one clear plastic packet of crystalline substance was found in his possession . The said Drugs was seized from the Accused. The Drugs was subsequently analysed and found to contain not less than 82.59 grams of methamphetamine.

9       Following his arrest, the Accused was then led to his place of residence at Blk 431 Jurong West Ave 1, #XXX, where a search was conducted in his flat and further drug exhibits were seized among other items from his flat.

10     The main evidence supporting the Proseuction’s case rest primarily on the crucial testimonies of both Edgar and Malcolm to establish that the Accused had possession of the Drugs with the actual knowledge of the specific nature of the Drugs.

11     Edgar testified that Ah Boy had instructed him and Malcolm to deliver “25s” for their last delivery at Serangoon[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3). “1s” refers to 5 grams of methamphetamine[^4] and “25s” refers to 125 grams of methamphetamine. Malcolm similarly confirmed that they were supposed to deliver “25 sets of ice” to a customer in Serangoon[^5]. “Ice” is the street name for methamphetamine.

12     Both Malcolm and Edgar’s evidence on the details of the arrangement of the drug transaction between the Accused and Ah Boy was corroborated by the contents of Exhibit P1 which contained the screenshot of messages retrieved from Edgar’s phone. The 10th line of the message of Exhibit P1 showed “25s $2200”, which Edgar explained as referring to the delivery of “25s” to the Accused in exchange for $2,200[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6). In particular, the “25s” was keyed in by Edgar under Ah Boy’s directions prior to the delivery and the “$2200” was filled in by Edgar after the successful delivery.

13     Edgar testified that whilst in the car he believed that the Accused had opened the blue plastic bag which contained the Drugs and “looked into it”, but could not be sure as part of his view was obscured[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7). The Accused did not raise any disagreement about his order after doing so [^8].

14     Malcolm stated that he heard the Accused verbally ascertaining the drug order with Edgar by saying “_er shi wu tao_” to Edgar after receiving the Drugs. This phrase, as translated, implied 25 sets or 125 grams of methamphetamine[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9). Malcolm also heard the ruffling of the blue plastic bag after the Accused was handed the Drugs and similarly confirmed that the Accused did not raise any disagreement about the order[^10].

15     According to the Accused, upon his arrest, he was first shown the contents of the blue plastic bag, which was a “clear plastic with white crystalline substance inside”[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11), by Sgt Xu during the recording of his contemporaneous statement on 7 November 2019 at 1.30 a.m.[^12]. According to Sgt Xu, the Accused behaviour was normal and calm and he showed no discernible reaction when the white crystalline substance was shown to him[^13]:

16     It is the Prosecution’s case that the Accused has failed to rebut the presumption that he was in possession of the Drugs for the purpose of trafficking under s 17(h) of the MDA.

## The Defence

17     The main crux of Accused defence was that he had mistakenly taken delivery of the Drugs from Edgar after having made the payment whilst inside the car without checking its contents. He claimed that he had ordered 20 slabs of a Erimin-5 from “Ah Boy” instead of the 125g of methampethamine as delivered to him by Edgar.

18     These 20 slabs of a Erimin-5 were allegedly meant for his own consumption. The Accused further claimed that he had been trafficking in street drugs, such as vape and Viagra (among other street drugs), and not controlled drugs. The street drugs were kept at his bedroom of his residence at Jurong West Avenue which were allegedly not discovered by the CNB officers during their search of his bedroom at the time of his arrest.

## The Court’s Decision on the trafficking charge

19     What is clear and undisputed in the trial is that the Accused had physical possession of the Drugs as they were recovered by SI Tan Chee Hwee (“SI Tan”) from Accused’s front left pocket upon his arrest[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14). Further, the Accused knew of the existence of the Drugs in his pocket, having admitted to receiving the Drugs from Edgar and placing them in his pocket[^15].

20     The two key issues to be decided by this court are (i) whether the Accused knew the nature of the Drugs which may be proved or presumed pursuant to s 18(2) of the MDA; and (ii) that the Drugs found in the possession of Accused was for the purpose of trafficking which may be proved or presumed pursuant to s 17 of MDA.

21     The Accused’s defence that he did not know that he was receiving 125g of methamphetamine as he had ordered 20 slabs of a Erimin-5 from Ah Boy defies logic and credibility in the light of the indisputable evidence adduced from Edgar and Malcolm.

22     There was no evidence from Edgar’s phone messages record to suggest that there could be a mistaken delivery by Edgar and Malcolm to the Accused pursuant to the instructions given by Ah Boy.

23     Edgar and Malcolm started working as drug couriers for Ah Boy sometime around the later half of 2019[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16). Ah Boy would give Edgar specific instructions on who to deliver the drugs to and what drugs to be delivered through phone calls or Telegram messages[^17].

24     On 6 November 2019 sometime around 9.00 to 10.00 p.m., Edgar and Malcolm had collected drugs for delivery from one unidentified person in the vicinity of Kranji MRT under Ah Boy’s instructions[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18). The drugs received were packed in different bags and appeared to be labelled[^19].

25     After collecting the said drugs, they carried out two deliveries before returning to Malcolm’s home to rest. Later, Edgar received a call from Ah Boy instructing him to deliver the last packet of “25s” to a customer at Jurong[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20).

26     On the way to Jurong in the car, Ah Boy informed Edgar that the venue for the drug delivery was to be changed to an Esso petrol station near Kovan. However, the drug order of “25s” was stated expressly to remain the same[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21). When Malcolm and Edgar arrived at the Esso Station at Kovan, Edgar shifted to the backseat while Malcolm shifted to the front driver’s seat. The Accused entered and sat at the front passenger’s seat. The Accused paid $2,200 to Edgar and Edgar handed the Drugs, which were packed in a transparent ziplock bag and placed into a blue plastic bag, to the Accused. The Accused did not raise any disagreement about the order after the receipt of the Drugs.

27     The Defence sought to discredit Edgar and Malcolm as unreliable witnesses claiming that there were “material inconsistencies” in their evidence, as between each of their oral testimonies, as well as when compared against the CCTV footage retrieved from the Esso petrol station[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22). In my view the inconsistencies highlighted by the Defence cannot be characterised as material inconsistencies as they do not have any direct bearing on the facts in issue and hence do not detract from this court’s assessment on both Edgar and Malcom’s veracity as witnesses on the material issues in question.

28     The inconsistencies raised by the Defence concerned largely on differences in recollection and observation by Edgar and Malcolm on what transpired at Malcolm’s house, time of their arrival at the Esso station, time taken to wait for the Accused’s arrival, seating arrangement in the car upon arrival at the Esso Station, the manner of authentication between Accused and them prior to Accused boarding the car, what conversation transpired between them and Accused in the car, the duration inside the car, whether the Accused had approached the car from the left or the right and whether the Accused had walked in front or behind the car after alighting from it.

29     In my view, it was not unusual for there to be differences in human perception and recollection of the events by them in their oral testimonies. Their credibility was not impugned as their testimonies on the material aspects remain internally consistent in their evidence and externally consistent with other extrinsic evidence adduced in the course of the trial such as the telephone messages and CCTV footages.

30     I found Edgar and Malcolm to be forthright in their testimonies and they did not seek to embellish their evidence in the trial. It was Malcolm who categorically heard the Accused saying “_er shi wu tao_” to Edgar after receiving the Drugs. Although Edgar did not mention that Accused said these words to him in Chinese, both of them were consistent in confirming that Accused did not raise any objections when the Drugs were handed to Accused.

31     There was nothing to suggest to Edgar and Malcolm that Accused could not have checked the contents inside the blue plastic bag. Edgar testified that he believed that Accused had opened the blue plastic bag which contained the Drugs and “look into it”. Malcolm stated that he heard ruffling of the blue plastic bag after the Accused was handed the Drugs.

32     The manner the Drugs were packed in a transparent ziplock bag and placed in the blue plasic bag made it easily identifiable and verifiable by the Accused from the “look and feel” of the Drugs after he received the Drugs from Edgar.

33     Edgar and Malcolm were arrested at around the same time as the Accused for having delivered the Drugs to the Accused. I found them to be credible and candid in their testimonies as they had decided to own up. I found no merit in the Defence submission that Malcom had an ulterior motive to implicate the Accused when both of them had no prior dealings with him and there was no credible evidence to suggest that there was a reasonable basis for Malcolm and Edgar to falsely implicate the Accused.

34     I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that he Accused’s version that he did not check the contents of the Drugs while inside the car was simply unbelievable and untenable:

> (a)     The Accused agreed that it was very important that he received the correct drug order and that it would fully be in his interests to get what he had ordered[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23);

> (b)     The Accused acknowledged that he was in the best position to ascertain if he had been handed the correct order at the point of receiving the goods[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24) and to reject the goods on the spot and withhold payment to the couriers without accepting delivery of the drugs if the delivery turned out to be wrong[^25];

> (c)     The Accused had multiple opportunities to quickly verify the order himself, either through a quick glance at its contents which was “easy and practical”, only requiring about 2-3 seconds[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26), or just by feeling the contents of the blue plastic bag[^27].

> (d)     The Accused acknowledged that there were glaring differences between the packaging of 20 slabs of Erimin-5 and 125 grams of methamphetamine[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28). Erimin-5 tablets are packaged in red and silver slabs of 10, with the slabs having noticeably sharp edges[^29]. These slabs would either be tied together with a rubber band, taped together or wrapped with newspaper[^30];

> (e)     On the other hand, methamphetamine or ice takes the form of a white crystalline or powdery substance that would often be packaged into a ziplock bag[\[note: 31\]](#Ftn_31);

> (f)     The weight of the Drugs (before analysis) recovered from the Accused was 123.9 grams, which was more than twice the weight of 20 slabs of Erimin-5 which stood at 54.69 grams[\[note: 32\]](#Ftn_32).

> (g)     Given the Accused’s admission that he had touched the item he was handed[\[note: 33\]](#Ftn_33), the flimsiness of the blue plastic bag which contained the Drugs[^34] and the Accused’s keen familiarity with the physical feel of Erimin-5 as contrasted with methamphetamine[^35], the Accused would have been immediately alerted to the fact that he was not in fact handed Erimin-5 at the point of receipt if he was to be handed the wrong delivery of the Drugs.

35     That the Accused behaved normally and calmly without showing any sign of protest that he had received a wrong delivery of the Drugs when he was shown the contents of the Drugs recovered from him by Sgt Xu further indicated that Accused knew all along the nature of the Drugs found in his possession prior to his arrest.

36     In my view the Prosecution had clearly established that the Accused had the requisite knowledge of the nature of the content of the Drugs found in his possession. I did not accept Accused’s defence that he did not check the content of the Drugs while he was inside the car. It was evidently an afterthought and an outright fabrication on his part to deny knowledge of the nature of the Drugs.

37     I found that Accused has not adduced any credible evidence to rebut the presumption of trafficking. The Accused’s unsubstantiated claim that he had ordered Erimin-5 for his own consumption cannot form any basis of a rebuttal of the presumption for trafficking of methampethamine which was an entirely different type of drug from Erimin-5.

38     Both the Prosecution and Defence had gone through great length to contend with each other on Accussed’s claim that he had trafficked in other street drugs instead of the controlled drugs. Notwithstanding that there was no credible evidence to support the Accused’s claim that he could have indulged in trafficking of street drugs, the mere fact that he may have been involved in trafficking street drugs would not in any way serve as a credible rebuttal of the presumption of trafficking of the methampethamine.

39     In the circumstances, I found that Accused had actual knowledge of the Drugs found in his possession and had failed to rebut the presumption under s 17 MDA and accordingly I convicted the Accused on the trafficking charge.

## Guilty Plea for Other Charges

40     After the Accused’s conviction, he pleaded guilty to the following six charges:

> (a)     \[DAC-939655-2018\] On 28 November 2018, one count of possession of 64.37g of methamphetamine under s8(a) punishable under (p/u) s33(1) of MDA (_enhanced_);

> (b)     \[DAC-939656-2018\] On 28 November 2018, one count of possession of 4.39g of MDMA under s8(a) p/u s33(1) of MDA (_enhanced_);

> (c)     \[DAC-942827-2018\] Sometime before 28 November 2018, one count of consumption of MDMA under s8(b)(ii) p/u s33(4) of MDA (_enhanced_);

> (d)     \[MAC-911016-2019\] On 9 February 2019, one count of attempt to enter the Resorts World Sentosa casino by using another person’s identification under s175A of Casino Control Act read with s511 of Penal Code (CCA charge);

> (e)     \[DAC-931362-2019\] On 7 November 2019, one count of possession of 24.49g of MDMA under s8(a) p/u s33(1) of MDA (_enhanced_);

> (f)     \[DAC 908865-2020\] Sometime before 7 November 2019, one count of consumption of MDMA under s8(b)(ii) p/u s33(4) of MDA (_enhanced_);

41     The Accused consented to have 7 charges taken into consideration for purpose of sentencing:

> (a)     \[DAC-902897-2019\] On 28 November 2018, one count of possession of 0.54g of ketamine under s8(a) p/u s33(1) of MDA (_enhanced_);

> (b)     \[DAC-902898-2019\] On 28 November 2018, one count of possession of a controlled drug (4-methyl-a-ethylaminopentiophenone or its 3-methylbutan-1-one isomer or any of their respective methyl positional isomers in the phenyl ring) under s8(a) p/u s33(1) of MDA (_enhanced_);

> (c)     \[DAC-902899-2019\] On 28 November 2018, one count of possession of controlled drug (Dibutylone) under s8(a) p/u s33(1) of MDA (_enhanced_);

> (d)     \[DAC-902900-2019\] On 28 November 2018, one count of possession of controlled drug (N-Ethylpentylone and its 3-methylbutan-1-one isomer) under s8(a) p/u s33(1) of MDA (_enhanced_);

> (e)     \[DAC-902901-2019\] On 28 November 2018, one count of possession of controlled drug (MMB-FUBINACA or its 1-pentanoate or 2-methylbutanoate isomer or any of their respective fluoro positional isomers in the phenyl ring) under s8(a) p/u s33(1) of MDA (_enhanced_);

> (f)     \[DAC-908866-2019\] On 7 November 2019, one count of possession of 7.94g of ketamine under s8(a) p/u s33(1) of MDA (_enhanced_);

> (g)     \[DAC-908867-2019\] On 7 November 2019, one count of possession of 6.65g of methamphetamine under s8(a) p/u s33(1) of MDA (_enhanced_);

42     The Statement of Facts relating to his plea of guilt on the six charges can be found in **ANNEX A**.

## Sentence

## Prosecution’s Submission on Sentence

43     In the present case, the Accused is traced for drug offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”):

> (a)     In 2004, he was convicted of 1 count of drug trafficking (nimetazepam) under s 5(1)(a) r/w s 5(2) of the MDA and 1 count of drug consumption (nimetazepam) under s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA, and sentenced to a global imprisonment term of 2 years and 9 months’ imprisonment with 2 strokes of the cane. Two further counts of drug trafficking (nimetazepam) under the MDA were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing; and

> (b)     In 2010, he was convicted of 1 count of drug possession (ketamine) under s8(a) of MDA, for which he was sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment.

44     For the charge of trafficking which the Accused had been convicted on, the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment (for repeat offender) was 10 years’ imprisonment and the maximum term of imprisonment was 30 years’ imprisonment with 10 to 15 strokes of the cane.

45     The Prosecution relied on _Vasentha d/o Joseph v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 122</span> (“_Vasentha_”), where the High Court had set out a sentencing framework for first-time traffickers in diamorphine.

46     In _Loo Pei Xiang Alan v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 500</span> (“_Alan Loo_”), the High Court held that based on parity between the statutory sentencing ranges, 1g of diamorphine was equivalent to 16.7g of methamphetamine (the “conversion rate”). The High Court then applied the conversion rate to the sentencing framework in _Vasentha_ to extrapolate the indicative starting sentences for the offence of trafficking in different quantities of methamphetamine.

47     Based on the above conversion rate of 1 g of diamorphine equivalent to 16.7g of methamphetamine, 82.59g of methamphetamine would be equivalent to about 4.95 of diamorphine.

48     Further, when dealing with repeat offenders, the court will also be concerned with the circumstances in which the repeat offence came about (_Soh Qiu Xia Katty v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 260</span> (“_Katty Soh_”)[^36] at \[63\]). _Katty Soh_ sets out the range of indicative sentences when dealing with repeat offenders under s 5(1) of the MDA (at \[44\] and \[55\]).

49     The Prosecution submitted that the indicative starting sentence for a repeat offender for trafficking in 82.59g of methamphetamine is a sentence of between 11 years and 6 months’ imprisonment to 14 years and 6 months’ imprisonment, with 10 to 12 strokes of the cane.

50     In determining the appropriate uplift to impose for the trafficking charge, the Proseution urged the court to have due regard to the circumstances of the repeat offence and the numerous aggravating factors in this case, namely:

> (a)     Accused was more culpable than a mere courier and played a key role in trafficking drugs for his own financial gain;

> (b)     Accused was a recalcitrant and incorrigible offender who was not deterred by his previous stints in prison;

> (c)     The Accused committed the offence of trafficking and other offences while he was released on bail showing his total disregard of authority and a blatant disrespect for the law;

> (d)     The Accused was found to be in possession of a wide variety of drugs in his residence after his arrest on 7 November 2019 which included another 6.65 grams of methamphetamine, 101 tablets of Erimin-5, 7.94 grams of ketamine and 161 tablets of ecstasy.

> (e)     There were 7 other drug possession charges taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

51     For the above reasons the Prosecution submitted that a sentence at the higher end of the indicative range which is 14 years’ imprisonment and 11 strokes of the cane would be warranted for his trafficking charge.

52     As the Accused had claimed trial to the trafficking charge, he would not benefit from the mitigating effect of a guilty plea.

53     The Accused pleaded guilty to 3 proceeded charges under s 8(a) of the MDA and 2 proceeded charges under s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA. As he is traced for both drug possession and consumption, the mandatory minimum sentences of 2 years’ imprisonment and 3 years’ imprisonment are applicable for his s 8(a) and s 8(b)(ii) MDA offences respectively.

54     The Prosecution sought for the mandatory minimum sentence of 2 years’ imprisonment for the charge involving the possession of 4.39 grams of MDMA committed on 28 November 2018 \[DAC-939656-2018\]. As for the possession of methamphetamine charge committed on 28 November 2018 \[DAC-939655-2018\] the Accused was found to be in possession of a large quantity of methamphetamine (64.37 grams) which was above 25 grams and would have triggered the presumption of trafficking. In the circumstances, taking into account the sheer quantity of the methamphetamine involved an uplift of 6 months from the mandatory minimum sentence would be warranted. The Accused was found to be in possession of 24.29 grams of MDMA \[DAC-931362-2019\] on 7 November 2019 while released on bail. The fact that an offence was committed while on bail is an aggravating factor which would warrant an uplift from 2 years’ imprisonment to 2 years and 6 months’ imprisonment.

55     The Prosecution sought for the mandatory minimum sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment for the accused’s consumption of MDMA in \[DAC-942827-2018\] and a stiffer sentence of at least 3 years and 6 months’ imprisonment for the other MDMA consumption charge \[DAC-931362-2019\] on the grounds that the latter offence was committed while the Accused was released on bail.

56     The Prosecution submitted that at least 3 sentences ought to be ordered to run consecutively. Relying on the Court of Appeal in _ADF v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 1 SLR 874</span> (“_ADF_”)[^37] which has identified the following “cumulative aggravating factors”, which would warrant running more than 2 sentences consecutively, where one or more of such factors are present (at \[92\] and \[146\]):

> (a)     Where the court is dealing with persistent or habitual offenders;

> (b)     Where there is a pressing public interest concern in discouraging the type of criminal conduct being punished; and

> (c)     Where there are multiple victims.

57     The Prosecution submitted that at least two factors are present in the current case – the Accused’s antecedents and the present proceedings which clearly indicated that Accused is a persistent offender. Further, there is a pressing public interest concern for drug offences to be sternly dealt with, given the harmful impacts they have on the wider community.

58     In assessing the global sentence to be sought, the Prosecution urged the court to consider the totality principle as set out in _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span>[^38]. The Accused would face a sentence of at least 19 years and 6 months’ imprisonment with 11 strokes of the cane if three sentences were to be ordered to run consecutively.

59     However, applying the principle of totality as a final check, the Prosecution sought an adjustment of the global sentence downwards to 18 years’ imprisonment with 11 strokes of the cane with three sentences relating to the drug charges to be ordered to run consecutively as follows: a sentence of 13 years’ imprisonment with 11 strokes of the cane for the trafficking charge \[DAC-931361-2019\]; 3 years’ imprisonment for the drug consumption charge \[DAC-942827-2018 -mandatory minimum – consecutive\]; and 2 years’ imprisonment for the drug possession charge \[DAC-9313612-2019 - mandatory minimum – consecutive\].

60     As for the charge of attempting to enter RWS Casino by pretending to be some other person, the Prosecution sought for an appropriate fine to be imposed.

## Mitigation

61     Defence Counsel submitted that the Accused’s drug related antecedents date back to 2004 and 2010 which are more than 10 years ago. The Accused has to support his aged parents who are presently 66 years and 77 years of age. Accused is currently 41 years old and would be in his early 50s upon his release from prison after taking into account the remission period.

62     The Defence urged this court to impose a sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment with 10 strokes of the cane for the trafficking charge \[DAC-931361-2019\]; mandatory minimum sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment for the drug consumption charge \[DAC-942827-2018 - consecutive\]; and mandatory minimum sentence of 2 years’ imprisonment for the drug possession charge \[DAC-931262-2019- concurrent\] yielding a total sentence of 15 years imprisonment with 10 strokes of the cane and a fine of $2000 for the Casino Control Act charge \[MAC-911016-2019\].

63     In the alternative if the Court was minded to order three charges to run consecutively, the Defence Counsel submitted that the global sentence should not exceed 17 years imprisonment with 10 strokes of the cane and a fine of $2000.

## The Court’s Decision on Sentence

64     Both the Prosecution and the Defence had referred to the same High Court decisions in _Vasentha_ and _Katty Soh_ in arriving at their submissions on the appropriate sentence to be imposed for a repeat offender who have trafficked in 82.59g of methamphetamine . A downward adjusted sentence of 13 years with 11 strokes of the cane as sought by the Prosecution for the trafficking charge was merely 1 year and 1 stroke of the cane above the 12 years’ imprisonment with 10 strokes of the cane sought by the Defence.  

65     In determining what should be an appropriate sentence to be imposed for this trafficking charge I considered the case of _Alan Loo_, where the accused was sentenced to 12 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane for trafficking in 11.64g of methamphetamine. _Alan Loo_ pleaded guilty to 4 proceeded charges and consented to 9 TIC charges, which were all drug-related offences. Considering the fact that _(i)_ the amount of methamphetamine trafficked in this case is more than _7 times_ that of _Alan Loo_; and _(ii)_ the Accused’s decision to claim trial to the charge, an appropriate uplift above the sentence of 12 years imprisonment with 10 strokes of the cane would be fully justified.

66     I agree with Prosecution’s submission that at least 3 sentences ought to run consecutively as both specific and general deterrence are called for when this court is dealing with a recalcitrant offender and to protect the public from future harmful conduct by like-minded individuals.

67     Taking into account the aggravating factors highlighted by the Prosecution in this case and the totality principle as well as the different legal interests to be protected, I accordingly imposed a global sentence of 17 years and 6 months’ imprisonment with 10 strokes of the cane and a fine of $2000 in default 1 week imprisonment as follows: 12 years and 6 months imprisonment with 10 strokes of the cane for the trafficking charge \[DAC-931361-2019\] to run consecutively with the mandatory minimum of 3 years’ imprisonment for the drug consumption charge \[DAC-942827-2018\] and the mandatory minimum of 2 years’ imprisonment for the drug possession charge \[DAC-931362-2019\]. In addition a fine of $2000 in default 1 week imprisonment was imposed for the CCA charge.

68     The Accused is now serving sentence pending his appeal.

### i.    Facts relating to the 1st charge (DAC-939655-2018) – possession of methamphetamine

4.     Exhibit “D1A” was analysed by Tang Shi Ying Angeline (“**Tang**”), an analyst with the Illicit Drug Laboratory (“**IDL**”) of the Health Sciences Authority (“**HSA**”) and found to be one packet containing not less than 94.33 grams of crystalline substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 63.89 grams of **methamphetamine**.

5.     Exhibit “D1C” was analysed by Tang and found to be one packet containing not less 0.72 grams of crystalline substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 0.48 grams of **methamphetamine**.

6.     The accused admitted that he had purchased methamphetamine from one “YP Poh” as he was a habitual consumer of methamphetamine. Methamphetamine is a Class A controlled drug under the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“**MDA**”). The accused was not authorized under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to possess methamphetamine and has thereby committed an offence under s 8(a) of the MDA for possessing a total of 64.37 grams of methamphetamine.

7.     Further, before commission of the said offence, on 5 February 2010, the accused was convicted under s 8(a) of the MDA _vide_ DAC56300/2009 in Subordinate Court No. 18 and sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment, which conviction and punishment have not been set aside. The accused is therefore liable to be punished under s 33(1) of the MDA.

### ii.    Facts relating to the 2nd charge (DAC-939656-2018) – possession of MDMA

8.     Exhibit “A1C” was analysed by Lee Hui Zhi Shirley (“**Lee**”), an analyst with the IDL of the HSA and found to be ten (10) blue tablets each weighing not less than 2.92 grams which were analysed and found to contain not less than 1.08 grams of **MDMA.**

9.     Exhibit “C1A” was analysed by Lee and found to be two (2) red tablets weighing not less than 0.59 grams which was analysed and found to contain not less than 0.21 grams of **MDMA**.

10.    Exhibit “C1B” was analysed by Lee and found to be one (1) red tablet weighing not less than 0.29 grams which was analysed and found to contain not less than 0.10 grams of **MDMA**.

11.    Exhibit “C1C” was analysed by Lee and found to be twenty (20) red tablets weighing not less than 5.95 grams which was analysed and found to contain not less than 2.23 grams of **MDMA**.

12.    Exhibit “G1A” was analysed by Lee and found to be six (6) blue tablets each marked “N” weighing not less than 1.73 grams which was analysed and found to contain not less than 0.66 grams of **MDMA**; and one (1) blue tablet marked “3” weighing not less than 0.29 grams which was analysed and found to contain not less than 0.11 grams of **MDMA**.

13.    The accused admitted that he had purchased ecstasy from one “YP Poh” as he was a habitual consumer of ecstasy. “Ecstasy” is the street name for MDMA, which is a Class A controlled drug under the First Schedule to the MDA. The accused was not authorized under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to possess MDMA and has thereby committed an offence under s 8(a) of the MDA for possessing a total of 4.39 grams of MDMA.

14.    Further, before commission of the said offence, on 5 February 2010, the accused was convicted under s 8(a) of the MDA _vide_ DAC56300/2009 in Subordinate Court No. 18 and sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment, which conviction and punishment have not been set aside. The accused is therefore liable to be punished under s 33(1) of the MDA.

### iii.    Facts relating to the 4th charge (DAC-902897-2019) – possession of ketamine

15.    Exhibit “E1A” was analysed by Tang and found to be one packet containing not less than 0.74 grams of crystalline substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 0.54 grams of **ketamine**.

16.    Ketamine is a Class A controlled drug under the First Schedule to the MDA. The accused was not authorized under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to possess ketamine and has thereby committed an offence under s 8(a) of the MDA.

17.    Further, before commission of the said offence, on 5 February 2010, the accused was convicted under s 8(a) of the MDA _vide_ DAC56300/2009 in Subordinate Court No. 18 and sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment, which conviction and punishment have not been set aside. The accused is therefore liable to be punished under s 33(1) of the MDA.

### iv.    Facts relating to the 3rd charge (DAC-942827-2018) – consumption of MDMA

18.    The accused was then escorted to the Central Police Divisional Headquarters for further investigations, where he provided two bottles of his urine samples which were sealed “**CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU**” and marked “**C-SA-18-01173-1 WONG WEE BOON SXXX**” and “**C-SA-18-01173-2 WONG WEE BOON SXXX**” in his presence.

19.    The accused’s urine samples were analysed by analysts from the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of the HSA and found to contain **MDMA**.

20.    The accused admitted to consuming 3-4 tablets of ecstasy on a daily basis prior to his arrest. MDMA is a Specified Drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA. The accused was not authorized under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to consume MDMA and has thereby committed an offence under s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA.

21.    Further, before commission of the said offence, on 13 October 2004, the accused was convicted under s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA _vide_ DAC41229/2004 in Subordinate Court No. 3 and sentenced to 9 months’ imprisonment, which conviction and punishment have not been set aside. The accused is therefore liable to be punished under s 33(4) of the MDA

## B.    BACKGROUND TO THE 9TH CHARGE

22.    On 30 November 2018, the accused was released on bail pending the completion of investigations for the above-mentioned drug offences at \[2\] to \[21\].

23.    Sometime before 9 February 2019, the accused borrowed a National Registration Identity Card (“**NRIC**”) bearing NRIC No. XXX belonging to one Chua Hanjun, Kenny (“**Chua**”). The accused had asked for Chua’s NRIC under the pretext of renewing a mobile phone line that was registered under Chua’s name.

24.    On 9 February 2019 at or around 10.29 a.m., the accused attempted to impersonate Chua to enter the Resorts World Sentosa casino by furnishing Chua’s NRIC at the facial detection gantry. He knew that he would not be able to enter the said casino with his own NRIC as he had been under an exclusion order preventing him from entering casinos at that time.

25.    Security officers noticed that the accused was facing some issues at the facial detection gantry. Unpersuaded by the accused’s repeated claims that the NRIC belonged to him, the officers instructed the accused to follow them. However, the accused chose to flee from the scene when the officers were not paying attention to him.

26.    By attempting to enter a casino by pretending to be Chua, the accused has committed an offence under s 175A of the Casino Control Act (Cap 33A, 2007 Rev Ed) r/w s 511(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

## C.    BACKGROUND TO THE DRUG OFFENCES IN 2019

27.    The accused continued to purchase and consume drugs while on bail for his drug offences committed in 2018.
