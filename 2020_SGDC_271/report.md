## Introduction

2       The Accused pleaded guilty and was convicted on the following 2 charges:

## TIC Charges

4       The Accused admitted and consented to 7 other drug trafficking charges to be considered for the purposes of sentencing. All of these charges involved the possession of Class A controlled drugs for the purpose of trafficking.

## Antecedents

5       The Accused had no known antecedent.

## Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

6       The Prosecution tendered a written submission on sentence. In essence, the Prosecution submitted for a sentence of at least 9 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane for the 2nd charge (DAC 907060/2020) and a sentence of at least 7 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane in respect of the 6th charge (DAC 907064/2020).

7       The Prosecution contended that these 2 charges were distinct transactions. Nevertheless, the Prosecution did not object to the sentences running concurrently. This was because an uplift had been applied to the individual sentences to reflect the totality of the accused’s offending and the TIC charges.

8       In the circumstances, the Prosecution sought a global sentence of at least 9 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane

## Mitigation

9       In the written mitigation as amended in court, counsel highlighted the Accused’s personal background and the circumstances surrounding the offence.

10     With respect, I did not think the personal background and circumstances of the Accused had much mitigating value. In my view they were not so exceptional as to warrant much mitigating weight.

11     Next, counsel submitted that the Accused had played a limited role in the commission of the offence. It was contended that his role was limited to inspecting the drug consignments, tracking the drugs stored at his residence and packing the drugs into bags. He claimed that it was his longtime friend Edgar who had motivated him to “participate in the scheme to earn money”.

12     Based on the case of _Loo Pei Xiang Alan_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 500</span>, counsel submitted that the indicative sentence for a charge of trafficking 82.59g of methamphetamine was 6-7 years’ imprisonment and 6-7 strokes of the cane. In court, counsel submitted for a sentence of 7 years’ imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane in respect of DAC 907064/2020.

13     In respect of the charge of possessing not less than 266.22g of ketamine for the purpose of trafficking with common intention, counsel in the written submission, submitted for the minimum sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment. In court, counsel submitted for a sentence of 7 years’ imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane.[^1]

14     Counsel contended that the Accused had a lower level of culpability as he was a young offender. He trusted and relied on Edgar.

15     It was also highlighted that the Accused had pleaded guilty and deeply regretted his actions. He also had no antecedents.

16     Counsel submitted that the 7 TIC charges should have no bearing on the sentence as the multiplicity of these charges were because of the different types of drugs found. Moreover, they were all found in the Accused’s residence and were all part of the same transaction.

## Sentencing Considerations

17     Given the nature of the offences committed, the main sentencing consideration was clearly one of deterrence.

18     Next, I noted that the punishments prescribed for both the offences committed by the Accused were a mandated minimum imprisonment term of 5 years and 5 strokes of the cane and a maximum imprisonment term of 20 years and 15 stokes of the cane.

19     I considered the mitigation plea submitted by counsel. I noted that the Accused was about 28 years of age and had no prior criminal antecedent. Due credit was given for his plea of guilt and his co-operation with the authorities. However, the weight to be attached for his plea of guilt will necessary be less weighty as the Accused was caught red-handed.

20     It was not disputed that in respect of the charge for trafficking not less than 82.59g of methamphetamine, the sentencing framework laid down in _Loo Pei Xiang Alan v PP, supra_, was applicable. In this respect, the indicative starting point was 6–7 years’ imprisonment and 6–7 strokes of the cane.

21     “Indicative starting points were not determinative of the sentence but would have to be adjusted where appropriate “to reflect the offender’s culpability and the presence of aggravating or mitigating circumstances” (at \[48\]), such as whether the offender was directing the drug trade on a commercial scale, or involving others in the operation, or motivated by financial or other advantage, or performing only a limited function under direction (at \[51\]).” See _Loo Pei Xiang Alan v PP, supra_ at \[15\].

22     Bearing in mind this principle above, I considered the role played by the Accused and agreed with the Prosecution that the Accused’s culpability was low. The Accused’s role was reflected at \[15\] of the SOF. Although the Accused played the role of a courier but he also participated in other aspects. For example, he also inspected the drug consignments, kept track of the stocks and prepared and packed the drugs according to the customers’ orders. Clearly, he participated actively and was not as naive as contended by his counsel. For his role, the Accused had received a commission of $250 and $350 from his co-accused Edgar on two occasions. In my view, this rendered the offences committed by the Accused more serious. See _Adri Anton Kalangie v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGCA 40</span> at \[82\].

23     There were various aggravating factors which were considered in determining the sentence. One of these was the number of TIC charges. These TIC charges were for drug trafficking. With respect, I did not see any reason why the multiplicity of TIC charges due to the different types of drugs involved had no bearing on the sentence. In fact, in my view, it reflected a higher degree of sophistication in the operation and a higher degree of harm as it would reach a wider group of drug abusers. This was supported by the fact that despite the short period of criminal activities, besides selling the drug to Wong Wee Boon, the Accused had also collected the proceeds of sale from 2 other customers of “Boy”. See \[23\] of SOF.

24     Another aggravating factor was the involvement of a syndicate with Malaysian links. The Accused had admitted that he worked for the syndicate and participated in various aspects in the operation. See \[14\], \[15\] and \[19\] of the SOF. In my view, the Accused was not a mere courier as highlighted at \[22\] above.

25     In these circumstances and considering the mitigating and aggravating factors above, the Accused was sentenced to 7 years imprisonment and 6 strokes of the case in respect of DAC 907064/2020 (trafficking of methamphetamine). This was at the high end of the indicative starting point laid down in _Loo Pei Xiang Alan v PP, supra_.

26     As for the possession of not less than 266.22g of ketamine for the purpose of trafficking, the Accused was sentenced to 9 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane (DAC 907060/2020). In arriving at this sentence, I considered the quantity of Ketamine involved. The Accused’s culpability, the aggravating and mitigating factors discussed above were also noted. I was also guided by the sentencing precedents submitted.

27     It was highlighted in Parliament that an amount of “113 grammes of Ketamine is equivalent to 100 times the estimated daily dosage of the drug for an abuser. This basis is the same as that used for deriving the presumption amounts for other drugs, such as methamphetamine, ‘Ecstasy’ and heroin.” See _Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (16 January 2006) vol 80 at col 2095._

28     The minimum threshold to trigger the presumption of possession for trafficking was 113g. See section 17 MDA. In the present case, the quantity of Ketamine was 266.22g. Hence, the harm posed to drug abusers would be considerable. It would be more than 200 times the estimated daily dosage of the drug for an abuser.

29     Counsel had urged the court to differentiate between a person caught selling drugs and a person found having the drugs in his possession for the purpose of trafficking. In this respect, counsel submitted that the weight of the drugs should not be a deciding factor. With respect, I disagreed given the fact that Parliament has prescribed the same punishments for both situations. In the present case, sometime in October 2019, the Accused had stored a large quantity of ketamine for delivery and sale to customers of “Boy”. See \[14\] of the SOF. The Accused was arrested on 7 November 2019. Clearly, the Accused had been involved in criminal activities for a period of time before he was arrested. In my view, the weight of the drugs would be a relevant factor in sentencing. It provided a clear indication of the harm posed. The sentencing precedents also indicated the weight of the drug was a relevant factor in sentencing. See _Adri Anton Kalangie v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGCA 40</span> at \[81\].

30     The brief period of the Accused’s criminal activities would also negate the mitigating weight to be attached for his lack of criminal antecedents. See \[44\] of _Kanagaratnam Nicholas Jens v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 196</span>.

## Sentencing Precedents

31     The Prosecution tendered a number of sentencing precedents for the offence of trafficking Ketamine. The most relevant cases were summarized below.

32     In _PP v Han Fang Guan_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 649</span>, the offender was sentenced to 8 years’ imprisonment for the offence of attempted trafficking of 100g (hypothetical gross weight) of Ketamine.

33     In _PP v Tan Ann Yuen_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGDC 66</span>, DJ See Kee Oon (as he then was) noted at \[18\] that going by sentencing norms, with a quantity of Ketamine in excess of 300g, the sentence for the charge for trafficking in Ketamine alone ought to have been in the range of 10 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes (or more). However, he was guided by another unreported precedent (_PP v Ng Aik Cheng_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGDC 284</span>) where the High Court had affirmed an aggregate sentence of 13 years’ imprisonment with 10 strokes of the cane and $1,000 fine. That case involved more drug-related charges and TIC charges and the appellant was a repeat offender. The appellant in _PP v Ng Aik Cheng, supra_, was sentenced to the mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years 5 strokes of the cane for each of the 2 trafficking charges. One of these was for trafficking 88.93grams of ketamine. Two of these imprisonment terms were ordered to run consecutively, along with the imprisonment term of 3 years for one other count of drug consumption, leading to a global sentence of 13 years and 10 strokes and $1,000 fine. In _Tan Ann Yuen’s case_, the offender was sentenced to 9 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes for trafficking 804.43g of Ketamine. The offender was also convicted for other drug charges and was given a global sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment and 11 stokes of the cane and a $1,000 fine with a period of driving disqualification. In total, he had pleaded guilty to 5 offences.

34     In _Public Prosecutor v Sim Xin Qi, Dino_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGDC 244</span>, the offender claimed trial to trafficking in 153.5g of ketamine. He also claimed trial to three other drug trafficking charges. Upon his conviction after trial, he pleaded guilty to two other charges of drug possession (one for 95.08g of ketamine) and consented to 11 other charges being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. For trafficking 153.5g of Ketamine, the offender was sentenced to 8 years’ imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane. He was also sentenced to 14 years’ imprisonment and 7 strokes of the cane for trafficking methamphetamine. In total, he was sentenced to 16 years’ imprisonment and 22 strokes of the cane.

35     In _PP v Chow Mun_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGDC 473</span>, the offender was sentenced to 8 years’ imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane for trafficking 57.94g of ketamine.

36     I was mindful that some of the precedents cited above involved multiple charges and the courts could have calibrated the individual sentences such that the total sentence would not offend the principle of totality.

37     Based on the sentencing precedents, clearly the sentencing range for trafficking a quantity of 100g of ketamine would be at least 8 years and 5 strokes. On the other hand, the sentencing norms for trafficking in Ketamine in excess of 300g would be in the range of 10 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes (or more). Ultimately, the sentence to be meted out will have to be determined in the light of the circumstances and the facts of each case. In the present case, in view of the quantity of drug involved, the Accused’s culpability, the aggravating and mitigating factors discussed above, I was of the view that a sentence of 9 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane in respect of DAC 907060/2020 was appropriate. In my view, this sentence was not out of line with the sentencing precedents.

## Conclusion

38     Finally, I agreed with the Prosecution that the 2 proceeded charges involved separate and distinct transactions. Both charges involved different types of drugs and the offences took place at different places. The Prosecution could have submitted for the minimum mandated sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane for each offence and for the sentences to run consecutively for a total sentence of 10 years and 10 strokes of the cane. However, in consideration of the totality principle, the Prosecution was prepared not to object to the sentences to run concurrently.

39     I accepted the Prosecution’s submission and ordered both sentences to run concurrently. In my view, the global sentence of 9 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane was appropriate and necessary to give sufficient weight to meet the ends of deterrence, specifically and generally, and to reflect the Accused’s overall criminality.

40     The Accused is currently released on bail pending appeal.
