### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## A.   Background

#### The Charges

1       The Accused, Miss Chen Jialing, a 42 year-old female Chinese national, had claimed trial to two charges, namely a charge of being in possession of another person’s work pass without lawful authority under s 22(1)(f) and punishable under s 22(1)(ii) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Cap 91A, 2009 Rev.Ed.) (“EFMA”) in **MAC 912850 - 2017** and a charge of remaining in Singapore after the expiry of her visit pass without reasonable cause under s 15(1) and punishable under s 15(3)(a) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 2008 Rev.Ed.) in **DAC 901609 - 2018**. The charges against her were as follows:

_Exhibit C1C –_ **_1st Charge_**

“...are charged that you on 14 December 2017 at The Bentley Residences @ Kovan, 28 Kovan Road, #xxx, Singapore 544694, without lawful authority, did have in your possession a work pass bearing work pass number xxx which is issued to another person namely Chen Simei, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 22(1)(_f_) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Cap 91A, 2009 Rev Ed) and punishable under s 22(1)(ii) of the said Act.

_Exhibit C2A –_ **2nd Charge**

“…are charged that you, from **30.10.2017** to **14.12.2017**, did contravene the provisions of s 15(1) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 2008 Rev Ed), to wit, that you without reasonable cause, did remain in Singapore for a period of **1 month 15 days (46 days)** after the expiry of the Visit Pass issued to you on **29.09.2017** permitting you to remain in Singapore till **29.10.2017** and you have thereby committed an offence under s 15(1), and punishable under s 15(3)(_a_) of the Immigration Act.”

2       At the close of the entire case, Counsel for the Accused intimated in his written Closing Submissions at \[45\] that the Defence did not propose to respond to the Prosecution’s submissions regarding the overstaying charge in **DAC 901609 - 2018**. He further indicated that the Accused was electing to plead guilty to the said charge.

3       After a careful consideration of the evidence before me as well as the written submissions by both the Prosecution and the Defence, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case on the two proceeded charges beyond a reasonable doubt. I found the Accused guilty and convicted her in respect of both charges in **MAC 912850 - 2017** and **DAC 901609 - 2018**. My sentences were as follows:

(i)      **MAC 912850 - 2017 -** Nine weeks’ imprisonment for and

(ii)      **DAC 901609 - 2018 -** $3,000 in default 15 days’ imprisonment**.**

The global sentence imposed on the Accused was nine weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $3,000 in default 15 days’ imprisonment.

4       Dissatisfied with my decision, the Accused has filed a Notice of Appeal against her conviction in **MAC 912850 - 2017** and sentences in respect of both charges on 7 January 2019. She is presently on bail pending the hearing of her appeal. She has also paid the fine of $3,000 in respect of **DAC 901609 - 2018.**

5       I now provide the reasons for my decision.

#### The Trial

6       During the trial, the Prosecution had called two witnesses to the stand to give evidence against the Accused. They were:

## B.   Undisputed Facts

8       The undisputed facts in the present case is set out in the Statement of Agreed Facts (_Exhibit PS1_) reproduced below:

**I**      **Parties involved**

1    The complainant is ASP Tan Zhaofeng, an officer attached to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority ("ICA").

2    The accused is Chen Jialing, a 42-year-old female Chinese national, DOB: 25 July 1976. She was unemployed at the material time.

**II**      **First Information Report**

3    On 14 December 2017 at about 4.25pm, the complainant lodged a first information report stating: "We arrest one female for overstayer and also for fraudulent possession. Inform Ang Mo Kio F IO and was informed to call 999 so that someone can arrest her". The incident location given was 28 Kovan Rd, #xxx, The Bentley Residences @ Kovan, Singapore 544694 ("the unit").

**III**      **Facts pertaining to the charge**

4    Investigation revealed that, on 14 December 2017, at about 3pm, a team of ICA officers led by the complainant conducted a check at the unit. During the check, they found the accused present at unit, and arrested her for immigration offences.

5    At the time of arrest, various items were seized from the accused's belongings in the unit, including the following items, which the accused had in her possession at the time:

a.    Work pass issued to one Chen Simei pursuant to reg 2(1)(6) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower (Work Passes) Regulations 2012 on 26 July 2016;

b.    Letter from the Ministry of Manpower dated 29 September 2017;

6    Further investigations revealed that the accused is an ex-S Pass holder, whose S Pass was valid from 30 March 2017 till 20 March 2019 but was cancelled on 29 September 2017, after the accused resigned from her employment at Natureland Singapore Pte Ltd. After the cancellation of the accused's S Pass, she was issued with a 30 days' visit pass to stay in Singapore from 29 September 2017 till 29 October 2017. After the expiry of the said visit pass, the accused remained in Singapore without any authorization under the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 2008 Rev Ed) or the regulations made thereunder. The accused had thereby overstayed from 30 October 2017 till 14 December 2017 (the date of her arrest) for a period of 1 month and 15 days (46 days).

## C.   Issues

9       The main issues for my determination were whether:

a.     the Accused had _lawful authority_ to have in her possession the work pass belonging to Chen Simei in respect of the EFMA charge and

b.     the Accused had _reasonable cause_ to remain in Singapore for the period of 1 month 15 days (46 days) after the expiry of the visit pass that was issued to her in respect of the overstaying charge.

10     The Defence did not challenge the voluntariness of the Accused’s positive long statement recorded by PW2 one day after her arrest on 15 December 2017 at 1.35 a.m. (_Exhibit P8_) at Ang Mo Kio Police Station save for the accuracy of certain portions of the statement. Essentially in her long statement, she had stated that on 10 November 2017, she had handed over her cousin’s S Pass to a Chinese middle man who assisted her to rent a new place to stay. Chen Simei (i.e. DW2) is her cousin. Before she left the country and returned to China the previous year, Chen Simei had passed her S Pass to the Accused and asked her to help return it to her boss. However, the Accused did not help her return the S Pass and instead kept the S Pass with her. She had admitted to using the S Pass to rent the flat at 28 Kovan Road #xxx Residences@Kovan Singapore 544694.

## D.   The Prosecution’s Case

11     Essentially, it was the Prosecution’s case that the charges against the Accused are uncomplicated, and there is clear and cogent evidence in support of its case. It was submitted that by contrast, the Accused’s defence comprises a host of tenuous assertions which are contradicted by her previous statements and, in any event, untenable in law. The Court was urged to convict the Accused on both charges, which are made out beyond a reasonable doubt.

#### MAC 912850 - 2017 - EFMA Charge

### A.   The Accused’s assertion that Chen Simei consented to her possession of the work pass on the day of her arrest is clearly an afterthought and untrue

12     It was the Prosecution’s case that it is undisputed that the Accused, when she was arrested on 14 December 2017 at The Bentley Residences @ Kovan, 28 Kovan Road, #xxx, Singapore (“the unit”), had in her possession a work pass (“the Work Pass”) belonging to Chen Simei. Hence, the sole issue in dispute in relation to the EFMA Charge is whether the Accused had “lawful authority” to have in her possession the Work Pass within the definition of s 22(1)(_f_) of the EFMA.

13     It was submitted that the Accused’s only defence to the EFMA charge was her assertion at trial that Chen Simei had passed the Work Pass to the Accused on 13 December 2017, the day before the Accused’s arrest, and instructed her to return it to Chen Simei’s former employer. According to the Accused, as she was arrested the very next day, she did not have the opportunity to return the Work Pass to Chen Simei’s former employer even though, at all times, she intended to do so.

14     It was further submitted that this defence is clearly an afterthought, and is thoroughly contradicted by her previous statements to the arresting officer from the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (“ICA”) and the police. First, as the Accused admitted under cross-examination, she did not mention this account of the facts to the ICA arresting officer, ASP Tan Zhaofeng (“ASP Tan”), on the day of her arrest. It was submitted that although she later recanted this admission, and claimed that she did tell ASP Tan that Chen Simei had given her the Work Pass the day before, this was only after an improper and clearly leading intervention from Counsel who went so far as to say that he was “very sure \[the answer\] will be different from what was just recorded” if the question was “properly repeated” even though the question – and the Accused’s answer to it – was straightforward and simple[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1). When pressed on the inconsistency in her testimony, the Accused once again vacillated and eventually conceded that she “did not tell him \[_i.e._ ASP Tan\] in detail” what she had told the court[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2).

15     It was the Prosecution’s case that in contrast, ASP Tan’s unequivocal evidence was that the Accused had told him and his team of arresting officers that she had taken the Work Pass without the knowledge and permission of her “sister”, and had admitted to impersonating the owner of the Work Pass to rent the Unit[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3). It was submitted that ASP Tan’s evidence on this issue was consistent and unwavering, even under repeated cross-examination[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4). ASP Tan also clearly explained that the Accused’s confession to having fraudulent possession of the Work Pass was the reason why she was referred by the ICA officers to the police for further investigations.

16     It was highlighted that in the Accused’s long statement to the police, which was recorded the day after her arrest[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5), she outlined a completely different and contradictory account of how she came into possession of the Work Pass from her account at trial. The Accused stated that Chen Simei was her “cousin” and had passed the Work Pass to her “last year” (_i.e._ 2016) to return it to Chen Simei’s “boss” but that she did not do so. Instead, the Accused confessed that she had kept the Work Pass for about a year and used it to rent the unit in November 2017 through an unknown middle man. Although the Accused tried to challenge the accuracy of her long statement at trial, she admitted that the statement was voluntarily given by her. It was submitted that she could also not dispute the fact that the short statement of two pages contained detailed personal information which could have only come from her[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) and had no credible explanation for the glaring inconsistencies between her oral evidence in court and the detailed account given in her long statement on how she got hold of the Work Pass and had held on to it without Chen Simei’s consent, before subsequently using it to rent the unit.

#### i.   The evidence of Chen Simei in support of the Accused is both internally and externally inconsistent and cannot be accepted

17     It was submitted that at trial, the Defence also placed much stock on the evidence of Chen Simei, who appeared to corroborate the Accused’s version of events that the Work Pass had been passed to her on 13 December 2017. It was the Prosecution’s case that Chen Simei’s evidence, however, cannot accepted for three related reasons.

18     First, it was submitted that Chen Simei’s evidence was _internally inconsistent_, and it is clear that she was not being truthful on the stand. During her examination-in-chief (“EIC”), Chen Simei stated that, before she left Singapore, she had taken out the Work Pass from her luggage and passed it to the Accused, and asked the Accused to give it to Chen Simei’s boss. Chen Simei elaborated that she had to leave to go back to her hometown in China because her “mother was very sick”. Chen Simei also stated that it was because of this urgent trip to visit her sick mother (“the urgent trip”) that her boss cancelled the Work Pass, which is why she sought the Accused’s help to return the Work Pass to her boss. It was submitted that although the date of the urgent trip was not clear from Chen Simei’s EIC, her evidence was that she had passed the Work Pass to the Accused _“before \[she\] left” to visit her sick mother in China (i.e., before the urgent trip)._

19     It was further submitted that under cross-examination, when showed a copy of the police report filed by Chen Simei’s former employer on 15 November 2016 referring to Chen Simei needing to go back to her country because of “family matters”, she readily accepted that this was the urgent trip that she had referred to earlier in her EIC, when she had to leave to go back to her hometown because her mother was sick. She also expressly confirmed that this trip, which coincided with the cancellation of the Work Pass by her boss, was in _November 2016._

20     It was the Prosecution’s case that Chen Simei then contradicted her evidence by stating that she only opened her luggage and found the Work Pass before a trip in December 2017 when she had to leave Singapore because her “mother was very sick”. When this contradiction in her testimony on the date of the urgent trip was highlighted to her, it was submitted that Chen Simei scrambled for an explanation and eventually stated that the trip in December 2017 was also urgent because “\[m\]y mother was sick and my son was beaten up by the teacher”. Prior to that point, during Chen Simei’s EIC and the earlier portion of her cross-examination on the date of the urgent trip, there had been no mention by her of the December 2017 trip also being urgent, or of her son’s alleged beating by the teacher. It is submitted that it was thus evident that Chen Simei was making up her evidence as she went along, and that her testimony that she had only passed the Work Pass to the accused in December 2017 cannot be accepted.

21     It was the Prosecution’s case that the second reason why Chen Simei’s evidence cannot be accepted was due to the _external inconsistencies_ between her evidence and the statements by the Accused to the police outlined above. In particular, in her long statement, the Accused expressly stated that the Work Pass had been passed by Chen Simei before she left the country and returned to China “last year” (_i.e._ in 2016). This was in line with Chen Simei’s initial evidence that she had passed the Work Pass to the Accused before the urgent trip, which was in November 2016. It was submitted that the Accused’s long statement clearly contradicts Chen Simei’s later evidence that the Work Pass had only been passed to the Accused in December 2017. When this contradiction was highlighted to Chen Simei, she offered no explanation in response. Likewise, Chen Simei could not explain why the Accused had admitted in her statement that she had used the Work Pass to rent the unit except to say that “\[d\]ue to the lapse of time, I could have forgotten some facts”.

22     Third, and finally, it was submitted that Chen Simei is far from an independent witness. She is the Accused’s female cousin, who had stayed together with the Accused in Singapore and taken responsibility for their accommodation together. Her loyalty to the Accused was also evident from her responses given under cross-examination, in which she maintained her support of the Accused even when confronted with contradictory evidence from the Accused herself.

23     For the above reasons, it was the Prosecution’s case that Chen Simei’s evidence in support of the Accused’s defence cannot be accepted. It was submitted that if anything, the contradictions in Chen Simei’s testimony only bolster the analysis that the Accused’s sole defence at trial to the EFMA Charge – that she had been given the Work Pass merely one day before her arrest and had always intended to return it to Chen Simei’s former employer – is an afterthought, and untrue. It was submitted that instead, it is clear that the Accused did not have Chen Simei’s consent to have possession of the Work Pass on the day of her arrest on 14 December 2017, and had wrongfully used it to rent the Unit, as she admitted to both ASP Tan when she was arrested and in her long statement to the police.

### B. In any event, Chen Simei’s consent to the accused’s possession of the Work Pass does not amount to “lawful authority” for the purposes of the EFMA

24     It was submitted that Chen Simei’s alleged consent to the Accused’s possession of the Work Pass is legally irrelevant to the Accused’s liability under the EFMA charge as Chen Simei had no legal authority under the EFMA to allow the Accused to have possession of the Work Pass.

25     As there was no local case law on the definition of the phrase “lawful authority” for the purposes of the EFMA, it was further submitted that guidance can be taken from the Brunei decision of _Wong Ting Yong v PP_ which considered the issue of lawful authority in the context of the Emergency (Passports) Order 1983 (Brunei). The court in determining whether the accused had “lawful authority” to have in his possession passports belonging to five women for the purpose of the renewal of their work permits and visit passes, held that one must when seeking to define the term “lawful authority”, have regard to the object of the legislation (at 756). In that case as there was no prohibition against a passport holder handing over his passport to another for that person to act as his agent to carry out legitimate acts, the court held that the accused “lawful authority” to have possession of the passports for the purposes of the Act.

26     It was the Prosecution’s case that in the present case, the object and the statutory framework of the EFMA makes it clear that the custody of the work pass is personal to the foreign worker to whom it is issued and that he has no general authority to hand over the work pass to another person. Section 13(1) EFMA categorically states that “\[a\] work pass holder shall not allow any other person to have possession of his work pass”. The contravention of this provision is a criminal offence under s 22(1)(g) EFMA. It was highlighted that the only prescribed situation which a work pass holder may hand over possession of his work pass to another is when the work pass holder is required to hand over the work pass to his employer on the last day of his employment under s 13(2) EFMA. Even in that situation, the employer is obliged to return the work pass to the Controller of Work Passes within 7 days of the date he received the work pass. It was submitted that likewise under s 14(3) EFMA, if a person finds or comes into possession a work pass other than his own, he is obliged to “immediately deliver it to the Controller”. The contravention of this provision is also a criminal offence under s 22(1)(g) EFMA. It was submitted that the framework of the EFMA makes it clear that the custody and the possession of the work passes have been tightly circumscribed by Parliament.

27     It was submitted that the present case is a far cry from the situation in _Wong Ting Yong_ where the initial acquisition of the accused was not unlawful, and there was no law which prevented the passholders from handing over their passports to the accused as their agent. Instead, if Chen Simei had voluntarily handed over possession of the work pass to the Accused and authorised her to retain it as claimed by the Accused, Chen Simei herself would have committed an offence arising from the contravention of s13(1) EMFA. Hence, any authorisation by Chen Simei to the Accused’s possession of the work pass would clearly have been unlawful. It was further submitted that in such circumsatnces, the Accused’s claim that she had “lawful authorisation” to be in possession of the work pass issued to Chen Simei was legally untenable and contrary to the object and the framework of EFMA.

#### DAC 901609 - 2018 - Immigration Act Charge

28     It was highlighted that it was undisputed that the Accused had remained in Singapore without any authorization under the Immigration Act or the regulations made thereunder for a period of 46 days after her visit pass on 30 October 2017. The only issue during the trial was whether the Accused had _reasonable cause_ for the purposes of the Immigration Act to remain in Singapore after the expiry of her visit pass.

29     It was submitted that the leading authority on the meaning of “reasonable cause” for the purposes of s 15(3) Immigration Act is the High Court case of _Chan Chun Yee v PP_ \[1988\] 3 SLR(R) 172. In that case, it was held that the phrase “reasonable cause” indicates that the accused “must not only genuinely hold the belief that the endorsements are valid, but there must objectively be evidence showing that the belief was reasonable in the circumstances. It was the Prosecution’s case that she had not discharged the burden that she believed that she had the right to remain in Singapore and took reasonable steps to ensure that her visit pass was still valid and made reasonable steps to verify her own immigrations status.

30     It was the Prosecution’s case that the evidence indicated that she had knowingly overstayed in Singapore after her visit pass had expired namely:

(a)     The arresting officer had testified that the Accused had readily admitted to him and his officers that she had overstayed in Singapore when they arrested her and questioned on her immigration status.

(b)     While the Accused had been issued with an S-Pass to work for Natureland Singapore Pte Ltd, she admitted that she had returned the S-Pass to her employer of 29 September 2017 and subsequently received a letter from the Ministry of Manpower on the cancellation of her S-Pass with effect on the same date when she left her employment. This letter was found in her possession on the day of her arrest and it clearly stated that her pass had been cancelled on 29 September 2017.

(c)     The Accused had in her possession a Visit Pass and Embarkation Form which expressly stated that it was valid from 29 September 2017 to 29 October 2017 and that overstaying was an immigration offfence. The pass was personally issued to the Accused and was in possession at all times until 19 December 2017 when she was brought to ICA by PW2.

(d)     Even on the Accused’s own case, the only reason why she had allegedly believed that she was entitled to remain in Singapore after the expiry of the visit pass was because she was told by her agent when she first came to Singapore that she could stay here for two years. She had admitted that there was nothing else which led her to believe that she could stay in Singapore even after her S-Pass was cancelled and she did not make any efforts to find out whether she had a right to stay in Singapore after it was cancceld. It was submitted that the Accused had conceded that she made no reasonable inquiries to verify her own immigration status.

In the circumstances, it was the Prosecution’s case that the Accused plainly had no “reasonable cause” to remain in Singapore after the expiry of her visit pass and the overstaying charge was amply made out.

## E.   The Defence’s Case

#### The EFMA Charge

31     It was submitted that the overarching thrust of the Defence’s case is that in respect of the EFMA charge, the Prosecution had not satisfied the legal threshold of proving the elements of _mens rea_ sufficient to convict the Accused. It was further submitted the case theory submitted by the Defence through its witnesses was inherently believable and should be accorded significant weight by reason of the fact that Chen Simei had nothing to gain from giving evidence which would exonerate the Accused. It was highlighted that Chen Simei had struggled to return to Singapore to give evidence which would expose her to investigation or criminal charges if the Prosecution’s draconian interpretation of s 22 EFMA should be accepted by the Court.

32     It was the case for the Defence that the evidence of the defence witnesses should be accorded far greater weight than the police officers’ account of what the Accused had supposedly told them contemporaneously and the Accused’s statement. It was submitted that the Accused’s evidence at trial was that the statement was not interpreted carefully or explained to her and was grossly divergent from what had actually happened.

33     It was submitted that the Prosecution was required to show intent on the part of the Accused that she had very clearly come into possession of the said work pass in a dishonest or somewhat unreasonable fashion wherein there was clearly no unlawful authority made out. It was further submitted that the Accused did not at any time have dishonest intention or in any way took the work pass away from Chen Simei without her consent. The Accused had a good reason to come into possession of Chen Simei’s work pass and therefore the facts would not disclose the _mens rea_ being satisfied.

34     It was submitted that from a simple reading of s 22(1)(f) EFMA that there is no strict liability imposed by simply possessing another person’s work pass but that the said possession would have to be _without lawful authority_. The Defence disagreed with the Prosecution’s submissions that Chen Simei’s alleged consent was legally irrelevant to the Accused’s liability as Chen Simei had no legal authority to allow the Accused to have possession of the work pass. It was argued that the consent to the Accused’s possession of the work pass could give rise to a finding of lawful authority absolving the Accused from criminal liability. According to Counsel, the very mention of _without lawful authority_ shows implicitly that an inquest or enquiry must be done into the Accused’s mental state and that a defence of lawful authority could exonerate the Accused. In support of his arguments, Counsel had relied on ss 4(a) and 9A(2) Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev.Ed.).

35     It was highlighted that the incumbent duty upon persons leaving Singapore or who do not have any more entitlement to their work pass is to get the pass back to the lawful employer, and thereafter for the latter to surrender the physical pass card to the Ministry of Manpower. It was submitted that acts which facilitate this objective should be encouraged rather than sanctioned with criminal liability.

36     It was further submitted that it would be manifestly absurd or unreasonable if persons were unable to hand over their passes to another person for the purposes of returning it to their former employer and were instead to be charged and convicted and thereafter sentenced to custodial sentences. It is uncontroverted that logically the object of the statute would be to protect the integrity of the work pass system so that the number of foreign workers working in Singapore on such passes can be closey monitored and controlled (see _PP v Zhang Fu Jie_ \[2011\] SGDC 6113 at \[7\]). It was argued that a person acting in the manner which the Accused did was trying to fulfill her cousin’s legal obligations and not circumvent them.

37     In respect of the Prosecution’s submission that there is no general authority for a person to hand over his or her work pass to another person and that criminal liability would be immediately made out, it was argued that the Prosecution’s logic or interpretation is distorted and does not accurately portray the statutory intent. It was submitted that the strict proviso of a 7- day limit that the employer must return the work pass to the Controller relate to Parliament’s intention to prevent the common situation where bosses retain their employee’s work pass in order to control their employees and to impose discipline or pay docking regimes on the latter or as a general bargaining chip. It was further submitted that s 13(1) cannot be used to justify convicting an accused for holding her cousin’s pass (who was also her housemate for a long period) and who only did so after being entrusted by the latter the night before to return the said pass.

38     In response to the Prosecution’s submissions that the Accused’s version of events relating to the possession of the work pass as being contrived as an afterthought and was contradicted by her contemporaneous evidence in her statements to the arresting officer and the investigating officer, it was submitted that the Accused’s evidence was very clear and uncontroverted. Chen Simei had all the while consented to her possession of the work pass on the day of the arrest. The Accused not only had Chen Simei’s explicit consent, the latter had also given the Accused the work pass and that was the only reason why the Accused had physical possession of the work pass. It was further submitted that the Accused had no chance to return the work pass to Chen Simei’s former employer as she was arrested the next day.

39     It was submitted that the Accused’s version of events was not in any way inconsistent or dramatically contradicting to what she had stated to the arresting officer on the day of her arrest. The Accused had already stated on the day of the arrest she did not admit to her guilt. Counsel referred to the case of _Farida Begam d/o Mohd Arthma v PP_ \[2001\] where the High Courthad stated that the findings of credibility of witnesses can be based on a) demenour, b) internal inconsistency or lack thereof in the content of this evidence and c) the external inconsistency between the content of his evidence and extrinsic evidence.

40     It was further submitted that as regards demenour, it was clear that the Accused is a slow witted and very simple woman who had difficulty understanding complex questions from both the Prosecution and the Defence. Yet she was clear in maintaining her defence in the course of her trial and maintained her innocence. As regards the demenour of DW2, it was submitted she was unwavering in her evidence which had enhanced reliability despite the fact that it might expose her to criminal sanction herself.

41     In contrast, it was further submitted that due to the nature of their work, the Prosecution’s witnesses who are government enforcement agents would naturally lean towards wanting to see a conviction rather than an acquittal. It was the case for the Defence that PW2, IO Koh Yeow Sin had shown himself to be an overzealous IO who seemed adamant on securing a conviction rather than identifying or getting to the truth of the matter.

42     It was submitted that the defence witnesses’ testimony was consistent internally and was maintained throughout the entire proceedings. According to Counsel, any inconsistency with the statement recorded earlier could be more reasonably explained as due to inaccurate or impremised or rushed recording rather than low witness credibility.

43     It was further submitted that the external consistency of the evidence of DW1 and DW2 is buttressed by the fact that there are many records of DW2 having to leave Singapore to go back to China regularly and the fact that the signature on the Tenancy Agreement is that of DW2 and no evidence whatsoever to the contrary had been advanced by the Prosecution.

44     It was the case for the Defence that even taking the Prosecution’s case at its highest i.e. if the Court were to find that the Accused had admitted to impersonating Chen Simei at the time of her first being arrested contemporaneously, very low weight should be accorded to that statement which is a very short statement which is largely self-incriminatory and which is largely on in fact entirely an admission of guilt – from the interpreter and recording officer’s point of view. According to Counsel it seems extremely difficult to believe that in the short span of 25 minutes, questions were made to ask the Accused to fully disclose the long chronology of facts and sequence of events, that the said questions were interpreted in Chinese adequately and the answers due to be recorded were then explained meticulously and carefully to the Accused before being finalized. It was submitted that it is hard to believe that the self-incriminatory and “Prosecution-serving” statement represents an accurate record of the matter. Counsel also questioned PW2’s ability to interpret adequately the questions in Chinese given that he was not trained as an interpreter but purported to arrogate to himself the function of being an interpreter.

45     It was submitted that the key point in the Defence’s case theory that the pass was handed over to the Accused and entrusted for the purpose of returning to the former boss of Chen Simei is more believable than the extremely questionable statement for the reasons as set out above. It was further submitted that it was not at all unbelievable or difficult to believe that a simple minded and low income wage earner whose only friend or main confidant was her cousin would accept the cousin’s request to help her return the pass to her former employer. It was also not at all unbelievable that the simple minded and low income wage earner would subjectly in her own mind believe that she was doing what was proper and lawful in the circumstances.

46     It was submitted that Chen Simei’s evidence should be accorded an extremely high level of believability in light of how she had risked her own safety and the likelihood of being charged had not deterred her from coming to Singapore again and entering for the purpose of the second tranche of the trial and giving evidence to exonerate the Accused.

47     It was further submitted that it was the Prosecution’s case which was highly spurious. One key point is that the Prosecution’s case rests on a posited motive by the Accused to impersonate her cousin, for the purposes of renting a unit. However, the Prosecution had inexplicably chosen not to call the landlord. In the absence of the landlord, Chen Simei’s evidence that her signature was that which appeared on the Tenancy Agreement would proceed unrefuted.

48     In the premises, it was submitted that the Court should acquit the Accused fully of the EFMA charge as “manifest triable isssues of fact and law are raised in respect of the said EFMA charge faced by the Accused giving rise to reasonable doubts in favour of the said accused and thereby the Court should refuse to convict”.

#### The Overstaying Charge

49     With respect to the overstaying charage, Counsel had informed the Court that he did not propose to respond to the Prosecution’s submissions regarding the said charge as the Accused was electing to plead guilty to the charge. It was submitted that the Defence agreed with the Prosecution that the only issue was whether the Accused had any _reasonable cause_ for the purposes of the Immigration Act to remain in Singapore after her expiry of her visit pass.

50     Counsel highlighted in mitigation that the period of overstaying was relatively short. Therefore, the Defence asked for the usual sentencing tariff be imposed on such convicted persons for a similar period of overstaying as there was nothing to differentiate her from any other accused person.

51     Counsel submitted that he was instructed to plead with the Court to take a charitable view of the Accused’s failure to take further steps to verify her own immigration status. It was also submitted that as it was uncontroverted that the Accused has totally no linguistic ability in English whatsoever whether written or spoken, there was no reason for the Prosecution to assert the importance of the official letter from the Singapore authorities from the prominent Singappore government logo and the dates stated in the MOM letter.

52     It was the case for the Defence that there was no reason why the Accused’s version of the events should be disbelieved given that the Accused was a migrant whose primary concern would be to ekeing out her daily living, and with her own personal matters given that she was not a native and generally unfamiliar with the rules and procedures in Singapore and was simply trying to settle down.

53     Counsel agreed with the Prosecution that the seminal case of _Chan Chun Yee_ is indeed the leading authority on the meaning of “reasonable cause”. It was submitted that the case clearly illustrated that the level of the Accused person’s culpability would be a function of the extent of enquiry that the Accused had taken to enquire and ensure that there was a general right to enter or remain, and also to verify their own immigration status. Therefore, the mental state or level of “deliberateness” would certainly be relevant to the sentencing matrix for such matters. It was submitted that the degree of enquiry she had to make must be viewed in the context of her general level of education, and sophistication as an individual. Counsel urged the Court not to accept the Prosecution’s submissions which carried a general tenor of “deliberate and willful overstaying” of the highest order wherein the Prosecution characterises the Accused as a person who had every intention to overstay and that the Accused was merely conveniently denying the exact date of expiry of the visit pass. It was the case for the Defence that there was nothing inherently incredible about the Accused’s claim that she might have forgotten or overlooked the exact date of expiry.

54     It was submitted that there was nothing inherently incredible about the Accused placing on record that she was told by the agent when she first came to Singapore that she could stay here for two years. As a person who had paid the agent a sizeable sum of money, and who relied on the agent to do the necessary paperwork for her and working as an administrative and menial labourer essentially, it was submitted that it would not be inherently incredible for the Accused to believe that there is a presumption that she should be able to stay in Singapore for up to two years. It was further submitted that having regard to the mental state of the Accused, a fine of $5,000 would be sufficient to satisfy the factors of rehabilitation and general/specific deterrence. Counsel argues that the three cases cited by the Prosecution could be distinguished from the present case even in the event of a conviction on the basis that _PP v Abdur Rashad Abu Thaher_ and _PP v Qin Ting_ relate to circumstances where it is patently clear that the accused in those matters had no reason at all to believe that they were in any way entitled to hold on to the pass they were in custody of as the pass was either picked up and found on the street or was known to be a forged one. Therefore, the tariff meted out to the Accused even in the event of a conviction should be lesser than the two precedents cited.

## F.   Defence’s Supplementary Submissions

55     In his supplementary written submissions, Counsel had suggested that the Prosecution had been continually wavering between the two limbs of s 22(1)(f) EFMA of _uses_ and _having in possession_. It was submitted that both limbs are two separate limbs which are distinct conceptually and cannot be conflated with each other. Counsel had argued that the Prosecution seemingly continues to maintain the position of using the work pass to rent the unit and that the Prosecution was trying to have the best of both worlds by not preferring a charge on the use limb but yet continues to maintain the position that the main motivation for the wrongful possession of the work pass was for the purpose of impersonating the rightful owner of the pass and in order to rent the said unit.

56     It was submitted that very little weight should be accorded to the submissions as to that alleged motivation of the Accused given that the landlord who would be the most material witness had never given evidence at trial. Therefore, the evidence of Chen Simei that she was the one who met the landlord, took responsibility for organizing and taking card of accommodation and had been the one who physically signed on the Tenancy Agreement goes unrefuted.

57     It was further submitted that the reason for the Accused’s possession would be to satisfy s 13(2) EFMA. The Accused and DW2 were seeking to comply with s 13(2) EFMA and trying to get the physical pass back to the employer practicably. Counsel had argued that this was the only reason why the pass happened to come into the Accused’s possession and the Accused should be cloaked by the s 13(2) statutory exception on a purposive reading of the statute as the Accused had intended to act in accordance with the said provision.

58     It was submitted that the internal inconsistency in Chen Simei’s evidence as highlighted by the Prosecution is no inconsistency at all. DW2 had left Singapore to go back to China in November 2016 and there was no mutual exclusivity with there being another trip in December 2017. It was argued that both trips were at different times and both trips could well have happened.

59     It was further submitted the external inconsistency between Chen Simei’s evidence and the statements of the Accused to the police is also not an inconsistency. According to Counsel, there is no duty incumbent upon DW2 to explain or give reasons for an unfavourable statement which was purportedly recorded and declared as the Accused’s account. The contents of any statement by the Accused would not be within the witness’s particular knowledge and the witness could not be possibly or reasonably called upon to explain why the Accused had admitted in her statement that she had used the work pass to rent the unit.

60     It was the case for the Defence that whatsoever the closeness of Chen Simei to the Accused, it was still highly unlikely that Chen Simei would come back to give evidence or lie at her own cost and at risk to herself. It was submitted that as the Prosecution had not adduced any evidence or reason why DW2 would be willing to lie even at the risk of danger to herself and being charged as well, this point must militate stringly in favour of DW2’s credibility.

61     Finally, Counsel had argued that even if the Accused was convicted, the Defence would be relying on caselaw precedent in _PP v K Ramakrishna Kannusamy_ to implore the Court to impose a sentence of at most 5 weeks’ imprisonment.

## G.   The Prosecution’s Reply

62     In response to the Defence’s supplementary submissions, it was highlighted that the Prosecution’s main argument was that as a matter of evidence, the Accused did not have Chen Simei’s consent to hold on to the work pass in December 2017 which is the relevant period of the charge. Even at its highest, Chen Simei’s own initial evidence and the Accused’s statement indicates that there might have been consent but that would have been before her urgent trip in November 2016. However, the Accused then held on to the work pass for more than a year without any valid reasons.

63     It was further submitted that the alternative argument is that as a matter of law in any event, Chen Simei’s consent is immaterial and this had already been elaborated in the initial submissions. The Defence had submitted that the Prosecution’s interpretation would be draconian or absurd but the interpretation put forward is the only plausible interpretation that flows from the statute itself. If lawful authority simply means consent of the work pass holder, then the offence under s 3(1) EFMA would be rendered otiose and the tight regime for the control of the possession of work passes would be severely undermined.

64     The Prosecution clarified that on the issue of whether there was use of the work pass, the charge was not premised on the use of the work pass but premised on unauthorized possession. Nevertheless, the fact that there was use of the work pass for personal gain is a relevant aggravating factor. This was based on the Accused’s own statement as well as her oral admission to the ICA arresting officer.

65     On the final point on the relevance of the landlord’s evidence for the EFMA charge, the Defence had implied that the Prosecution should have called the landlord. However, the Prosecution’s position throughout the trial was that his evidence was completely irrelevant. The Prosecution’s case which is based on the Accused’s own statement was that the rental was through a middleman. So it naturally followed that the Accused would have never met the landlord.

66     In relation to the overstaying charge, the submissions indicated that the Accused wanted to plead guilty to the charge. It was highlighted that there was overwhelming evidence in support of this charge and no real weight can be given to this very late indication of plea.

## H.   Assessment Of Evidence

67     The Accused, a foreign national faced two charges, namely a charge of being in possession of another person’s work pass without lawful authority under the EFMA and a charge of remaining in Singapore after the expiry of her visit pass without reasonable cause under the Immigration Act.

#### i.    **MAC 912850 - 2017** – the EFMA Charge

68     In my assessment of the evidence before me, I was mindful that the Accused was an ex-S Pass holder, whose S Pass was valid from 30 March 2017 till 20 March 2019 but was cancelled on **29 September 2017**, after she resigned from her employment. She was then issued with a 30 days' visit pass to stay in Singapore from 29 September 2017 till 29 October 2017. After the expiry of the said visit pass, the Accused continued to remain in Singapore. When the Accused was arrested by the team of ICA officers on the afternoon of 14 December 2017, she was alone in the said unit although she purportedly shared the unit with DW2, her cousin Chen Simei. What was noteworthy was that it was undisputed that DW2 had only left Singapore the following day on 15 December 2017.

69     It was undisputed that at the time of her arrest on 14 December 2017, as indicated in the seizure report _Exhibit P3_, various items were seized from the Accused's belongings in the unit, including a work pass belonging to one Chen Simei that was issued on **26 July 2016** until **26 July 2018**, the letter from the Ministry of Manpower dated **29 September 2017** indicating that the Accused’s S Pass had been cancelled on **29 September 2017**, the tenancy agreement between one Tan Cho Meng and Chen Simei for the period from **10 November 2017** to **9 November 2018**, the stamp duty certificate in respect of the said tenancy agreement (_Exhibit D2_), a payment slip to ERA Realty Network Pte Ltd and a payment receipt to ERA Realty Network. Further, it was unchallenged by the Defence that on 19 December 2017 when the Accused was brought by PW2 to the Immigration and Checkpoint Authority building, when asked by the immigration officer whether she had any Visit Pass and Embarkation Form, she had voluntarily produced _Exhibit P6_, a Visit Pass and Embarkation Form which was valid from **29 September 2017** to **29 October 2017**. In addition, it was unchallenged by the Defence that Chen Simei’s employer had lodged a police report on **15 November 2016** in order to cancel her work permit.

70     With the above essential facts before me, the first issue for my determination was whether the Accused had _lawful authority_ to have in her possession the work pass belonging to Chen Simei in respect of the EFMA charge on 14 December 2017.

71     It was the Prosecution’s case that the Accused did not have Chen Simei’s consent to have possession of her work pass on the day of her arrest on 14 December 2017, and had wrongfully used it to rent the unit. It was also the Prosecution’s position that Chen Simei’s alleged consent to the Accused’s possession of the Work Pass is legally irrelevant to the Accused’s liability under the EFMA charge as Chen Simei had no legal authority under the EFMA to allow the Accused to have possession of her work pass.

72     In contrast, the Accused had claimed trial to this case on the basis of the Defence’s theory that the Accused’s possession of the said pass was lawful as Chen Simei herself had handed over the pass to her on 13 December 2017, one day prior to her arrest for the Accused to return it to Chen Simei’s former employer. It was also the Defence’s case that it would be manifestly absurd or unreasonable if persons were unable to hand over their passes to another person for the purposes of returning it to their former employer and were instead to be charged and convicted and thereafter sentenced to custodial sentences.

73     In the present case, after a careful consideration of the evidence before me, I accepted PW1’s unequivocal evidence that on 14 December 2017, the Accused had told him and his ICA team of arresting officers that she had taken the work pass without the knowledge and permission of her “sister”, and had admitted to impersonating the owner of the work pass to rent the unit. This was corroborated by the Accused’s own positive long statement recorded by PW2 on 15 December 2017 that before her cousin Chen Simei left the country and returned to China in 2016, the latter had passed her S Pass to the Accused and asked her to help return it to her boss. The Accused instead kept the S Pass with her and on 10 November 2017, she had handed over her cousin’s S Pass to a Chinese middle man who assisted her to rent the flat at 28 Kovan Road #xxx Residences@Kovan Singapore 544694. This was further corroborated by the documents seized from the Accused's belongings in the unit namely, the tenancy agreement (_Exhibit D1_), the stamp duty certificate in respect of the said tenancy agreement (_Exhibit D2_), a payment slip to ERA Realty Network Pte Ltd and a payment receipt to ERA Realty Network.

74     In my view Counsel’s assertion that due to the nature of their work, PW1 and PW2 who are government enforcement agents would naturally lean towards wanting to see a conviction rather than an acquittal was baseless and unsupported by evidence. I disagreed with Counsel’s assertion that low weight should be given to the Accused’s positive long statement as it was not interpreted carefully or explained to her and was grossly divergent from what had actually happened.

75     I also did not accept Counsel’s assertion that it seemed extremely difficult to believe that the Accused’s statement which was recorded in the short span of 25 minutes could fully disclose the long chronology of facts and sequence of events. In actual fact, the Accused’s statement _Exhibit P8_, was a short statement of two pages which contained detailed personal information which could have only come from her. I saw no reason to disbelieve the Accused’s own contemporaneous account in her own statements given to PW1 and PW2 shortly after her arrest in December 2017. I agreed with the Prosecution that Counsel’s submissions against the Prosecution’s evidence were but tenous unsupported assertions by Counsel against the Prosecution’s witnesses in order to contradict the weight of the Accused’s own admissions in her statements to the arresting officer (PW1) and the investigating officer (PW2).

76     Based on the evidence before me, I agreed that the defence raised by the Accused was clearly an afterthought. As highlighted by the Prosecution in their closing submissions, the evidence of the Defence witnesses, DW1 and DW2, were both internally and externally inconsistent. Despite Counsel’s lengthy and convoluted submissions, I was unable to accept his contention that evidence of the defence witnesses at trial should be preferred over that of the Prosecution’s witnesses or that there were no inconsistencies in the testimonies of DW1 and DW2.

77     Consequently, I rejected the Defence’s assertion that the Accused not only had Chen Simei’s explicit consent, the latter had also given the Accused the work pass on 13 December 2017 and that the Accused had no chance to return the work pass to Chen Simei’s former employers as she was arrested the next day. In my view, it was highly unlikely that Chen Simei had handed the work pass to the Accused on 13 December 2017 but instead had done so in late 2016 before her return to China after her former employer had cancelled Chen Simei’s work pass. I was also of the view that it was unlikely that the Accused and Chen Simei were housemates in the said unit prior to her arrest as the Accused was found alone in the unit although Chen Simei had only left Singapore one day after her arrest. Essentially I found that the Accused’s attempts to exculpate herself were wholly incapable of belief, primarily because of the evasive and shifting nature of her evidence whenever confronted with an inconsistency. The same was also observed in respect of Chen Simei’s evidence. Accordingly, I disregarded their evidence as I found that they were both not credible witnesses.

78     Based on the evidence before me, I found that the Accused did not have Chen Simei’s consent to have possession of her work pass on the day of her arrest on 14 December 2017, and had wrongfully used it to rent the unit. Furthermore, I agreed with the Prosecution that the object and statutory framework of the EFMA makes it clear that the custody of a work pass is personal to the foreign worker to whom it is issued and that he or she has no general authority to hand over the work pass to another person. Hence, Chen Simei’s alleged consent to the Accused’s possession of the work pass is legally irrelevant to the Accused’s liability under the EFMA charge. Accordingly, I found the Accused guilty and convicted her on the charge of being in possession of another person’s work pass without lawful authority under s 22(1)(f) and punishable under s 22(1)(ii) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Cap 91A, 2009 Rev.Ed.) (“EFMA”) in **MAC 912850 - 2017**.

#### ii.    **DAC 901609 - 2018 -** Immigration Act Charge

79     The Accused had claimed trial to a charge of remaining in Singapore after the expiry of her visit pass without reasonable cause under s 15(1) and punishable under s 15(3)(a) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 2008 Rev.Ed.). It was undisputed that the Accused had remained in Singapore without any authorization under the Immigration Act or the regulations made thereunder for a period of 46 days after her visit pass on 30 October 2017. The only issue during the trial was whether the Accused had _reasonable cause_ for the purposes of the Immigration Act to remain in Singapore after the expiry of her visit pass.

80     It was the Prosecution’s case that the Accused had knowingly overstayed in Singapore after her visit pass had expired. She had readily admitted to the arresting officer and his team of ICA officers that she had overstayed in Singapore when they arrested her and questioned on her immigration status. Furthermore, in the course of the trial the Accused had conceded that she made no reasonable inquiries to verify her own immigration status.

81     It was only after parties had tendered their closing submissions at the end of the trial that Counsel indicated to the Court in his submissions that he did not propose to respond to the Prosecution’s submissions regarding the overstaying charge as the Accused was electing to plead guilty to the charge. This meant that the Accused had accepted the Prosecution’s case and conceded that she had no reasonable cause to remain in Singapore after the expiry of her visit pass and had overstayed for a period of 46 days. Accordingly, I found her guilty and convicted her on the said charge in **DAC 901609 - 2018** of remaining in Singapore after the expiry of her visit pass without reasonable cause under s 15(1) and punishable under s 15(3)(a) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 2008 Rev.Ed.).

## Antecedents

82     The Accused was untraced.

## Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

83     In the Prosecution’s oral address on sentence, it was submitted that for the EFMA charge, from the sentencing precedents tendered, the benchmark sentence for plead guilty cases is in the range of two months’ imprisonment. Despite overwhelming evidence, the Accused had failed to plead guilty to the charge which demonstrates a blatant lack of remorse. Accordingly, it was submitted that a custodial sentence in excess of 8 weeks’ imprisonment was appropriate.

84     In respect of the overstaying charge, in view of the period of overstaying and her very late plea of guilt which cannot be given any mitigating weight, it was submitted that the maximum fine of $4,000 should be imposed.

## Mitigation

85     In respect of the EFMA charge, Counsel had relied on the case of _PP v K Ramakrishna Kannusamy_ and urged the Court to impose a sentence of at most 5 weeks’ imprisonment. It was submitted that the three cases relied on by the Prosecution could be distinguished from the present case as _PP v Abdur Rashad Abu Thaher_ (_MAC 904659 - 2017_) involved a Bangladeshi worker who found a work pass on the street, _PP v Zhang Fu Jie_ relates to a woman who used a work pass to enter into a casino and _PP v Qin Ting_ (_MAC 901266 - 2017_) involved a woman who was in possession of a forged work pass.

86     For the overstaying charge, it was submitted that a fine of $2,500 be imposed.

## The Prosecution’s Reply

87     In response to the Defence’s reliance on the case of _PP v K Ramakrishna Kannusamy_, it was highlighted that the global sentence imposed was for 44 months’ imprisonment and a fine of $450,000 in default 15 months’ imprisonment. It was submitted that it was not a useful case to compare the present case with.

## I.   The Sentences

88     The prescribed punishment for an offence under s 22(1)(f) and punishable under s 22(1)(ii) EFMA is a fine not exceeding $20,000 or to imprisonment not exceeding 2 years or to both. In determining the appropriate sentence, the various sentencing factors that a Court considers includes:

a)     the effect of the criminal conduct – whether it undermines foreign labour policies;

b)     the offender is an illegal immigrant;

c)     the offender had used the work pass to engage in illegal employment/criminal activities

d)     whether a syndicate was involved.

89     In the present case, the Accused is a foreign national who had remained in Singapore after the expiry of her visit pass. She had claimed trial to a charge of being in possession of another person’s work pass without lawful authority. As she had claimed trial to the said charge, she was not entitled to any discount in sentencing which is usually afforded to an accused who had pleaded guilty She had also used the said work pass to rent the flat at 28 Kovan Road #xxx Residences@Kovan. In doing so, she had undermined the tight regime for the control of the possession of work passes in Singapore.

90     In view of the above aggravating factors, the custodial threshold had been crossed and an imprisonment term should be imposed on the Accused. I noted that both the Prosecution and the Defence were in agreement that a custodial sentence should be imposed and the only difference was the length of the sentence. I also agreed with the Prosecution that _PP v K Ramakrishna Kannusamy_ was not useful as a sentencing precedent as in that case, the accused had pleaded guilty to 21 charges out of 181 charges before me. 15 of the proceeded charges were for the offence of operating a business of moneylending without a valid license under s 5(1) read with 14 (1)(b)(i) of the Moneylender Act, Cap 188 (Revised Edition 2010) together with five charges under ss 41(4) and 47(5) Passports Act (Cap 220, 2008 Rev. Ed.) apart from the single proceeded charge under 22(1)(f) EFMA of possessing another person’s work pass without lawful authority relied upon by Counsel.

91     After a careful consideration of the above factors, her clean record as well as the aggravating factors present, I was of the view that a sentence of nine weeks’ imprisonment was appropriate. I agreed with the Prosecution that the usual tariff for such offences was an imprisonment term of two months’ for accused persons who plead guilty. As the Accused had claimed trial to the charge, this warranted an uplift in the sentence and hence I imposed a sentence of nine weeks’ imprisonment.

92     I now turn to the prescribed punishment for the second charge.

93     The prescribed punishment for remaining in Singapore after the expiry of a visit pass without reasonable cause for a period not exceeding 90 days under s 15(1) and punishable under s 15(3)(a) of the Immigration Act is a fine not exceeding $4,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both. In determining the appropriate sentence, the various sentencing factors that a Court considers includes the purpose of overstaying, the length of overstaying and whether the offender had surrendered to the authorities.

94     In the present case, the Accused had overstayed in Singapore for a period of 46 days. This was not a case where she had voluntarily surrendered to the authorities but was arrested after a team of ICA officers conducted a check on the unit she was staying at. In addition, she had only elected to plead guilty to the charge after the close of the entire case. Under these circumstances, I agreed with the Prosecution that her late plea should not be given much mitigating weight.

95     After a careful consideration of the above factors as well as her clean record, I was of the view that a fine of $3,000 in default 15 days’ imprisonment was just and appropriate. The Accused had overstayed for a period of 46 days which was slightly above the midway point of the prescribed period of 90 days. Hence, a fine which was at the midway point of the maximum fine would have been appropriate for an accused person who had pleaded guilty to the charge. Nevertheless, an uplift was warranted in the present case in the light of her very late guilty plea and accordingly I imposed a fine of $3,000. I disagreed with the Prosecution that a maximum fine of $4,000 should be imposed as the facts in the present case did not warrant the imposition of a maximum fine. I also disagreed with Counsel’s proposed sentence of $2,500 as it did not provide the sufficient that was warranted in this case.

96     Dissatisfied with my decision the Accused had filed a Notice of Appeal against her conviction in **MAC 912850 - 2017** and her sentences in respect of both charges in **MAC 912850 - 2017** and **DAC 901609 - 2018**.
