Garnishee Orders – Future rent – Whether future rent can be attached under a garnishee order

16 March 2021

### Deputy Registrar Lewis Tan:

## Introduction

1       The judgment creditor (“the MCST”) was owed management and sinking funds by the judgment debtor (“the Landlord”), who is the registered proprietor of a unit under the MCST’s charge. To recover the sums due, the MCST sought and obtained a judgment in default of appearance against the Landlord. The sum due under the default judgment remaining unsatisfied, and having discovered that the subject unit had been tenanted to one Mr Khursheed Ahmed (“the Tenant”), the MCST then took out the somewhat unorthodox application of attaching any rent payable by the Tenant to the Landlord to satisfy the judgment debt.

2       At the _ex parte_ stage, the MCST was successful in obtaining a garnishee order to show cause against the Tenant, and to attach rent payable by the Tenant at a future date to answer the default judgment.

3       At the show cause hearing, however, the Tenant appeared to resist the attachment, arguing that there was in fact no debt due and accruing from himself to the Landlord. In considering whether to finalise the garnishee order, an issue that arose for my consideration was whether _future rent_ could be attached under a garnishee order. Given the lack of jurisprudence in Singapore on this issue, and having considered the matter fully, I set out my detailed reasons in these written grounds.

## Whether future rent is attachable under a garnishee order

4       A useful starting point in this regard is the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Ed) (“the Rules”), which provides at O 49 r 1(1) that where a judgment debtor is indebted to a judgment creditor, and where “any other person within the jurisdiction (referred to in this Order as the garnishee) is indebted to the judgment debtor, the Court may … order the garnishee to pay the judgment creditor the amount of _any debt due or accruing due_ to the judgment debtor from the garnishee” \[emphasis added\].

5       The question, therefore, is whether future rent falls within the ambit of “any debt due or accruing due”. Being rent that is only due at a future date, such rent would logically not amount to “debt due”. The focal point of my analysis therefore centres on whether future rent can amount to “debt … accruing due”, so that it may be attached under a garnishee order.

### Debt accruing due

6       I begin with the Court of Appeal’s decision in _Vintage Bullion DMCC (in its own capacity and as representative of the customers of MF Global Singapore Pte Ltd (in creditors’ voluntary liquidation)) v Chay Fook Yuen (in his capacity as joint and several liquidator of MF Global Singapore Pte Ltd (in creditors’ voluntary liquidation)) and others and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 1248</span> (“_MF Global CA_”). In that case, the respondent company was a commodity broker and holder of a capital markets services licence. The appellants were the respondent’s customers who had utilised its services to trade in currencies and commodities in a bid to profit from fluctuations in exchange rates or the price of commodities. During the lifespan of each trade, each customer would start with an “open position”, and for as long as his position remained open, the customer would be speculating and be exposed to movements in the market. If the movement of the underlying currency favoured the customer, the customer would have “Unrealised Profits”. The customer could stop speculating by closing his position, and at that point in time, his profits or losses would be crystallised, and if there was a profit, this would give rise to a sum known as the “Forward Value”, which was a fixed sum no longer subject to variation, and which would be credited into the customer’s ledger balance on a “Value Date”. This “Value Date” was generally two days after the closing of the customer’s position. The customer could then withdraw the “Forward Value” from his ledger balance.

7       The respondent company was wound up. In the winding up proceedings, the appellants argued that the profits in their accounts with the respondent were held on statutory trust for them because, amongst others, regulation 21(1)(_a_) of the Commodity Trading Regulations 2001 (s 578/2001) (“the Regulations”) required the respondent to:

>     … treat and deal with all money, securities or property received by him from a customer to margin, guarantee or secure contracts in commodity trading or spot commodity trading, **_or accruing to a customer_** as a result of such trading, as belonging to that customer … \[emphasis added in bold italics\]

8       In determining whether the alleged profits were “accrued to” the appellants, the Court of Appeal drew a distinction between the “Unrealised Profits” and “Forward Value”. According to the court, the “Unrealised Profits” were merely notional figures that would become actual figures or profits only upon the closure of the underlying transaction. As such profits had not been crystallised or finalised, the “Unrealised Profits” had not “accrued to” the appellants, and were not subject to the statutory trust under the Regulations. On the other hand, the “Forward Value” had in fact crystallised or been finalised, with the only qualification being that the appellants had no right of withdrawal of the “Forward Value” _until_ the Value Date had arrived. In other words, the appellants were already _legally entitled_ to the “Forward Value”, notwithstanding that they could only be withdrawn at a later date. Accordingly, the “Forward Value” had accrued to the appellants, which sum thereunder could be withdrawn after the Value Date (_MF Global CA_ at \[45\]–\[48\]).

9       Hence, in determining whether a debt is “due or accruing due”, the fundamental query is whether the creditor is _legally entitled_ to the debt. If the answer to this is in the affirmative, it does not matter that such a debt is only payable in the future, since such debt would have “accrued to” the creditor, and may accordingly be attached under a garnishee order (see _MF Global CA_ at \[40\]–\[42\]). It has therefore been observed that a debt that is presently existing but payable in the future comes within the ambit of a debt that is “accruing due” (_Lim Boon Kwee (trading as B K Lim & Co) v Impexital SRL (Sembawang Multiplex Joint Venture, garnishee)_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 1 SLR(R) 757</span> at \[16\]).

10     This focus on legal entitlement, rather than on whether and when payment is due, is also consistent with the English decision of _Tapp v Jones; Pooley, Garnishee_ (1875) LR 10 QB 591 (“_Tapp_”). In that case, the plaintiff obtained judgment against the defendant for the sum of 590_l_. At that time, an agreement was in force between the garnishee and the defendant, under which the garnishee was bound to pay the defendant a monthly instalment of 10_l_. Notwithstanding that the future instalments had not yet become payable, the English court granted a final garnishee order, with Blackburn J observing that “there is power to make an order against the garnishee for payment of his debts as and when they become payable, instead of making a fresh order as each falls due” (_Tapp_ at 593). As such, once a judgment debtor’s entitlement to payment is undisputed, a garnishee order may attach to the debt, notwithstanding that payment has not yet fallen due.

11     To further illustrate this point, reference may be made to the decision in _Globalpoint Far East Pte Ltd v Wah Cheng Pte Ltd (Prelim Construction Pte Ltd, garnishee)_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 267</span> (“_Globalpoint_”). There, the judgment creditor had obtained an adjudication determination for the sum of $71,036.23 against the judgment debtor. In seeking to enforce the judgment, the judgment creditor took out garnishee proceedings against the garnishee, who was a general contractor that had issued a progress payment certificate (“PPC”) certifying that certain sums were owed by the garnishee to the judgment debtor. Nonetheless, the garnishee resisted the garnishee application, arguing that the PPC was not actionable by the judgment debtor before the due date of payment (_Globalpoint_ at \[16\]). Rejecting this contention, Deputy Registrar Hairul Hakkim observed that the debt was unconditionally acknowledged by the garnishee upon the issuance of the PPC, and only payment was deferred. Under such circumstances, the obligation to pay had crystallised, and the debt was capable of being garnished (_Globalpoint_ at \[17\] and \[23\]–\[24\]).

12     This may be contrasted with the facts in _Neale Douglas Bryant v Salvina Inez Indemini (Kwek Pong Hwee Paul and others, garnishees)_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGMC 19</span> (“_Neale Douglas Bryant_”). In that case, the judgment creditor sought to attach the security deposit that the garnishees were holding pursuant to a tenancy agreement between themselves and the judgment debtor. After surveying various Malaysian authorities, Deputy Registrar Lim Wen Juin declined to make the final garnishee order sought by the judgment creditor as this would deprive the garnishees of the benefit of the security deposit under the tenancy agreement. In the learned DR’s view, “if there is money owed by the garnishee to the judgment debtor but on terms that the garnishee is entitled to hold the money for a period of time that has not yet ended and to set that money off against any debts that the judgment debtor might come to owe to it, the garnishee order should allow the judgment creditor to take only the money that is left after any such set-off has taken effect and only after that period has ended” (at \[17\]). While put in different terms, I think that this statement of principle is correct, in so far as the emphasis is on whether the judgment debtor is _legally entitled_ to the debt sought to be attached. Until such legal entitlement has crystallised, the debt cannot be attached, even if in all likelihood such sum would eventually be due to the judgment debtor.

13     Put in other terms, debts which are contingent on a future event, or which may be properly set off in future, are _contingent debts_, which are not attachable under a garnishee order. As Venkatarama Iyer J stated in _Shanti Prasad Jain v The Director of Enforcement, Foreign Exchange Regulation Act_ AIR 1962 SC 1764 (cited with approval in _MF Global Singapore Pte Ltd (in creditors’ voluntary liquidation) and others v Vintage Bullion DMCC (in its own capacity and as representative of the customers of the first plaintiff) and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 831</span> at \[113\]):

>     A contingent debt is strictly speaking not a debt at all. In its ordinary as well as its legal sense, a debt is a sum of money payable under an existing obligation. It may be payable forthwith, solvendum in praesenti, then it is a debt ‘due’ or it may be payable at a future date, solvendum future; then it is a debt ‘accruing’. But in either case it is a debt. But a _contingent debt_ has no present existence, because it is _payable only when the contingency happens_, and ex hypothesi that may or may not happen. \[emphasis in original\]

Similarly, in _MF Global CA_ (\[6\] _supra_), the following observations were made at \[41\]:

>     In the context of garnishee proceedings, O 49 r 1(1) of the Rules … provides that the court may “order the garnishee to pay the judgment creditor the amount of any debt due or _accruing due to_ the judgment debtor from the garnishee” \[emphasis added\]. The decisions draw the necessary distinction between contingent debts on the one hand and debts which are _presently existing though payable in the future_ on the other, of which only the latter are captured within the meaning of the phrase “any debt due or accruing due”… \[emphasis in original\]

14     At risk of repetition, the focus therefore is whether the judgment debtor is presently _legally entitled_ to the debt in question; contingent debts do not fall under this category, as the judgment debtor would only become entitled to the debt upon the contingency happening. This determination of whether the judgment debtor has become legally entitled to the debt requires a consideration of the precise arrangement between the judgment debtor and the putative garnishee. For example, in _Tapp_ (\[10\] _supra_), pursuant to their instalment agreement, the judgment debtor was legally entitled to payment from the garnishee, albeit in instalments. In _Fairview Developments Pte Ltd v Ong & Ong Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 318</span>, the architect was entitled to payment upon the completion of various stages, which entitlement was not dependent on when such debt became “due and payable” (see, in this regard, _MF Global CA_ at \[42\]).

15     Once it is ascertained that the judgment debtor has a legal entitlement to payment from the garnishee, a garnishee order may be made in respect of that debt. The timeline for payment is immaterial in this regard, since a debt that is payable forthwith is simply a debt that is “due”, while a debt that is payable in the future is a debt “accruing due”: see _Globalpoint_ (\[11\] _supra_) at \[17\]. Both such debts are encompassed by O 49 r 1(1) of the Rules, which applies to any debt “due or accruing due”.

### No entitlement to future rent under the tenancy agreement

16     Returning to the facts of the present case, the tenancy agreement between the Landlord and the Tenant provided that the monthly rent of $2,400 “is payable monthly in advance without deduction whatsoever on the 9th day of each month”. Such rent was earned on a monthly basis, with the sum of $2,400 comprising $1,500 as rental for the premises, $700 as charges for the hire of the furniture therein, and $200 as maintenance charges.

17     Hence, the earning of monthly rent by the Landlord was _contingent_ on his performance of the tenancy agreement by letting the premises and furniture therein to the Tenant. If such was performed, the Tenant would be obliged, on the 9th day of each month, to pay $2,400 as rent to the Landlord. If, for example, the Tenant was wrongfully evicted from the premises before the expiry of the tenancy agreement, the monthly rent of $2,400 would not remain payable to the Landlord. Given this contingency, as at the time of making the garnishee order, the Landlord’s entitlement to payment of _future rent_ would not have crystallised, and accordingly, there was no basis to make a garnishee order with respect to any such future rent. This differs from the cases of _Tapp_ (\[10\] _supra_) and _Globalpoint_ (\[11\] _supra_), where the judgment debtor’s legal entitlement to payment had been finalised, and only payment was deferred; such debts were then appropriately attached under a garnishee order as debt accrued.

18     I understand that a party like the MCST may find such a position difficult to accept. But, putting aside the authorities, I observe that it accords with good sense that future rent cannot generally be attached under a garnishee order, unless the terms of the tenancy agreement clearly provide that the landlord is entitled, _without qualification_, to the payment of all rent (including future rent) upfront. To do otherwise would, in my view, expose a garnishee-tenant to more than he may have agreed to under the tenancy agreement. In this regard, it bears noting that a garnishee order that is made final is a court order that would bind the garnishee, and would therefore have the effect of compelling the garnishee-tenant to pay on rent as they fall due for the period that the garnishee order continues to be in effect. Such legal compulsion to pay would exist _independently_ of the tenancy agreement. This may result in the garnishee-tenant being liable to pay rent even if, for example, he has been wrongfully terminated or evicted from the premises by the judgment debtor-landlord, or if the tenancy agreement was terminated prematurely by mutual consent. Were such events to occur, the judgment debtor could lose his legal entitlement to payment of monthly rent from the garnishee-tenant. Yet, under the final garnishee order, the garnishee-tenant would remain obliged to pay the rent to the judgment creditor, to offset the judgment debtor’s debt. But, “the judgment creditor cannot have any better or greater right than the judgment debtor would have had against the garnishee, and any rights that the garnishee might possess pursuant to the terms governing the debt ‘cannot be nullified by attachment’ under the garnishee order” (_Neale Douglas Bryant_ (\[12\] _supra_) at \[17\], citing _Binamin MJC Quarry Sdn Bhd v Way Soon Construction Sdn Bhd_ \[2001\] MLJU 111). By attaching any future debt which the judgment debtor may lose its entitlement to, the court risks exposing the garnishee to debts that may never fall due. This cannot be right.

19     I am fortified in taking this view by the decision of _Hall v Pritchett_ <span class="citation">(1877) 3 QBD 215</span>. In that case, an order was made for the attachment of salary due from the garnishee to the judgment debtor, in the sum of 20_l_ 16_s_ 8_d_, this sum representing the monthly salary payable by the garnishee to the judgment debtor. A motion was then taken out to set aside the order, on the ground that the debt attached was not due or accruing at the date of the garnishee order. This was accepted by Cockburn CJ and Mellor J, who ruled that “the future salary cannot be attached” (at 217). In so deciding, the coram “entirely concur\[red\]” with the decision in _Jones v Thompson_ (1858) E B & E 63, where Crompton J observed that there can be no debt owing nor accruing until there is “a debt perfected”; it was “_not sufficient that in all probability there will be a debt, as in the cases of rent or annuities not yet due_. The mere fact that it is most probable that there will be a debt is not sufficient. There must be an actual debt” \[emphasis added\].

20     Much the same observation was made by F A Chua J in _Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp v Goh Su Liat (Telecommunication Authority of Singapore, garnishee)_ \[1985–1986\] SLR(R) 430. There, in setting aside the garnishee order absolute that attached _future salary_ that was not yet payable by the garnishee-employer to its employee, the judgment debtor, the Judge observed as follows (at \[13\]):

>     There is no dispute that the judgment debtor’s October salary was not due until 31 October 1985. So at the date of the garnishee order absolute, 4 October 1985, there was no attachable debt. _Even an existing right under which something is accrued which will probably become a debt at some future date is not sufficient_ notwithstanding that the amount to become due is capable of being calculated with precision… \[emphasis added\]

21     Summarising the above, a judgment creditor cannot attach a debt which the judgment debtor does not yet have an entitlement to, and it is not sufficient in this regard that the debt, such as monthly rent, will in all likelihood become due at some date in the future. Accordingly, “future rent” ought not to be attachable under a garnishee order _unless and until_ the judgment debtor becomes legally entitled to such rent, so that it can be said to have fallen “due or accruing due” (O 49 r 1(1) of the Rules).

## Whether there was any debt due or accruing

22     Having decided as such, the issue then turned to whether there was any rent due or accruing due by the Tenant to the Landlord. To this end, the Tenant satisfactorily produced bank records showing his timely transfer of the monthly rent of $2,400 to the Landlord. These bank records stretched back to 2019, and the most recent transfer was on 9 February 2021. The bank records were also shown to the MCST’s counsel, Ms Lee Shu Xian (“Ms Lee”), who confirmed that such payments of rent were made by the Tenant. Accordingly, there was simply no debt due and/or accruing from the Tenant to the Landlord, at least until February 2021.

23     The Tenant further informed me that he was due to vacate the unit on 8 April 2021, after his tenancy agreement with the judgment debtor expired. This end-date of 8 April 2021 was corroborated by the tenancy agreement, which was also tendered before me, and confirmed by Ms Lee. The tenancy agreement also stated that a security deposit of $2,400, being one month’s rent, had been paid by the Tenant upon the signature of the agreement, and that such security deposit was repayable within 14 days of expiry of the tenancy agreement on 8 April 2021. The Tenant then showed me records of WhatsApp conversations between himself and the Landlord’s agent, to support his case that his final month’s rent for the period of 9 March 2021 to 8 April 2021 would not be paid, as it would be offset against his security deposit.

24     Viewing the evidence in totality, I accepted that there was no debt due or accruing due from the Tenant to the Landlord, and the provisional garnishee order was accordingly discharged.

## Conclusion

25     In conclusion, a debt can only be attached under a garnishee order if the judgment debtor is legally entitled to payment of the debt. Once such legal entitlement is ascertained, the debt can be garnished even if it is only payable at a future date, as such a debt that is payable in the future would be a debt “accruing due”, which may be attached pursuant to O 49 r 1(1) of the Rules. In the present case, however, I was satisfied that no such debt was due or accruing due from the Tenant, who had made prompt payments on his monthly rent, and who had taken steps to ensure that his final month of rent would be offset against his security deposit which was equivalent to a month’s rent. I therefore dismissed the garnishee order.

26     As the Tenant was employed and had taken time off work to attend the proceedings, and as he had evidently gone through some efforts to prepare for the show cause hearing (including but not limited to printing the monthly bank transfer statements, the tenancy agreements, and his WhatsApp messages with the Landlord’s agent), I ordered the MCST to pay the Tenant $300 as reasonable compensation for his work done in the proceedings.
