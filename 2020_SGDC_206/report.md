### District Judge Ong Luan Tze:

1       The Accused claimed trial to a single charge of failing to provide a specimen of his urine for urine test within such time as was required by officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) under s 31(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”), and pleaded guilty to two charges for failure to report for urine test under regulation 15(3)(_f_) of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (“the Regulations”), as set out in the table below:

2       As the Accused had previously, on 10 June 2013, been convicted for an LT1 offence under s 8(b)(ii) and punished under s 33A(1) of the MDA to a term of five years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane, the trial charge was punishable under s 33A(2) of the MDA.

3       At the conclusion of the trial, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven the trial charge beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him. He then pleaded guilty to the two other charges as set out above.

4       After hearing parties on sentencing and mitigation, I imposed the following sentences:

5       The result is a global sentence of eight years and six months’ imprisonment, and six strokes of the cane. The sentence was backdated to 29 December 2018, when the Accused was first remanded.

6       The Accused has now appealed against both his conviction (presumably for the trial charge) and sentence.

## The Trial Charge

### Prosecution’s case

7       On 19 February 2018, the Accused was placed under a 24 month period of drug supervision under regulation 15 of the Regulations with effect from 21 March 2018. He was supposed to report for testing every Monday and Friday.[^1] From 28 May 2018 onwards, the accused defaulted on his urine tests, all the way until he was arrested on 28 December 2018.

8       On 28 December 2018 at about 4.35 a.m., the Accused was arrested by police officers on suspicion of having committed the offences of being in possession of an offensive weapon, and fraudulent possession[^2]. In the course of the arrest, one black flick knife and one driving licence belonging to a Bharrany s/o Tarumarajoo was seized from the Accused. Upon screening, the Accused was also found to be wanted by the CNB for the offence of failure to report for urine test. The Accused was brought back to Bedok Division Headquarters.

9       At about 11 a.m. on the same day, the Accused was taken out of the Bedok Division lock up by PW3 Sergeant Irwanudin Bin Razali (“PW3 Sgt Irwanudin”) from the CNB. The purpose of taking the Accused out of lock up was to procure his urine sample.

10     At about 11.45 a.m., PW3 Sgt Irwanudin instructed the Accused to provide three bottles of his urine sample, and warned him that he might be charged under s 31(2) p/u s 33A(2) of the MDA if he failed to provide this. The warning was read and explained to the Accused in English, and he acknowledged by signing against the warning entry in the station diary[^3]. The Accused drank five cups of water, but informed that he was unable to urinate.

11     At about 12.15 p.m., PW3 Sgt Irwanudin made the same request and administered the same warning to the Accused. The Accused similarly acknowledged by signing. He did not drink any water on this occasion, and maintained that he did not have the “feeling to urinate”.

12     At about 12.45 p.m., PW3 Sgt Irwanudin made the same request and administered the same warning to the Accused. The Accused acknowledged by signing, did not drink any water and still said that he did not have the feeling to urinate.

13     At about 1.15 p.m., PW3 Sgt Irwanudin made the same request and administered the same warning to the Accused. The Accused acknowledged by signing, and drank two cups of water. The Accused maintained that he did not have the feeling to urinate.

14     At about 1.45 p.m., PW3 Sgt Irwanudin wrote down the same request and warning in the diary, but before he could administer it, the Accused complained of a general pain in his body. As such, PW3 Sgt Irwanudin and his colleagues decided to bring the Accused for a medical assessment. A few other CNB officers were involved in this escort, including PW4 Staff Sergeant Muhammad Haziq Bin Hassan (“PW4 SSgt Haziq”), PW5 Sergeant Loh Jia Seng (“PW5 Sgt Loh”) and PW6 Sergeant Guan Zhenfu (“PW6 Sgt Zhenfu”).

15     As the Accused had a right toe fracture arising from the arrest in the morning, he had to be in a wheelchair. In the course of transferring the Accused to the vehicle for escort to the hospital, the officers noticed that there was a wet patch at the groin area of the Accused’s pants. They could also smell urine. PW4 SSgt Haziq asked the Accused why his pants was wet and the Accused said that he urgently needed to urinate and he could not control his urine. The Accused was then transferred back out of the vehicle and brought back to the CNB office.

16     The Accused was later escorted to the toilet to change his pants. While at the toilet, he told a CNB officer that he wanted to urinate urgently. PW4 SSgt Haziq then instructed one of the officers present to pass a master bottle to the Accused for him to provide his urine sample. This was not the usual protocol, but as the Accused needed to urinate urgently and he was in a wheelchair, the CNB officers decided to pick out a master bottle for him. They opened up the master bottle in the Accused’s presence and handed it to him.

17     The Accused then stood in front of the urinal, holding the master bottle in one hand. However, he urinated into the urinal instead of into the bottle. PW4 SSgt Haziq observed this, and wrote it down in the station diary.

18     PW6 Sgt Zhenfu went to get a new pair of pants from the lock up for the Accused. When he returned, he seized the wet clothing from the Accused, consisting of a pair of light blue-coloured pants and a pair of checkered boxers (admitted and marked P6), and placed these in a clear polymer bag. He then assisted the Accused to put on the new pair of pants, a pair of dark blue-coloured Bermudas shorts. While this new pair of pants was still being pulled up halfway, the Accused urinated again without any warning. This second urinating incident in the CNB toilet was not noted down in the station diary because all the officers present were busy dealing with the situation. PW6 Sgt Zhenfu seized this second set of pants (admitted and marked P7), and went to get another pair of pants for the Accused to change into.

19     After changing his pants, the Accused was brought to Changi General Hospital (“CGH”). At about 2.40 p.m., PW6 Sgt Zhenfu instructed the Accused to provide three bottles of his urine sample, failing which he may be charged for an offence under s 31(2) of the MDA. The Accused acknowledged this warning by signing below it on the diary. However, this signature was not captured in the copy of this page in the station diary. The original diary has since gone missing and was not available at trial.

20     While in the CGH holding room, the Accused told PW6 Sgt Zhenfu that he wanted to urinate. However, before PW6 Sgt Zhenfu could escort him to the toilet, the Accused took his penis out from his pants and urinated onto the floor, while still sitting on the wheelchair. PW6 Sgt Zhenfu and PW5 Sgt Loh had to clean up the floor with tissues.

21     At this point, PW6 Sgt Zhenfu decided not to administer any more warnings to the Accused as he assessed that the Accused was not cooperative.

22     When a nurse later asked the Accused to provide his urine sample for testing, the Accused asked the nurse if the urine sample would be given to the CNB. This was heard by both PW3 Sgt Irwanudin and PW6 Sgt Zhenfu. The nurse replied that the sample would not be given to the CNB. The nurse passed the Accused a bottle[^4] (which was smaller than the master bottle CNB uses to procure urine samples) and the Accused was then escorted to the toilet to provide his urine sample. He did so with no issues.

23     After the medical assessment, the Accused was escorted back to the CNB office. While at the CNB office, PW5 Sgt Loh asked the Accused why he had behaved in the way he did, by not providing his urine sample to them as requested. The Accused replied that the reason he behaved this way was because he smoked “Mushroom”.

24     The evidence by the CNB officers was that the Accused did not at any point inform any CNB officer that he wanted to provide his urine sample to the CNB. If he had done so, the officers confirmed that they would have procured his urine accordingly.

25     A statement was recorded from the Accused on 28 December 2018 at about 6.15 p.m.[^5] The accused did not challenge the voluntariness of this statement. In this statement, the accused admitted that he smoked “Mushroom” about two days ago, and the reason why he did not provide the CNB officer with his urine sample was because he was scared that his urine will be tested positive for “Mushroom”. In the same statement, he also claimed that he had “bladder issues” on the day of arrest, and was unable to control his bladder.

26     A medical report dated 11 April 2019 by Dr Yam Wai Loon confirmed that the Accused was “able to pass urine with no suspicion of retention”[^6].

27     The two sets of pants seized were subsequently sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis. The first set (marked “A”) consisting of a pair of light blue-coloured pants and a pair of checkered boxers tested positive for the presence of urea and creatinine, indicating that “the presence of urine could not be ruled out”.[^7] Methamphetamine was also detected in the extract from this set of pants marked “A”.[^8]

28     The second set of pants (marked “B”) consisting of a pair of dark blue-coloured Bermudas shorts was analysed for the constituents of urine, and Tamm-Hosfall protein (“THP”) but none was detected, indicating that urine was not present.

29     At the end of the Prosecution’s case, I found that there was a prima facie case made out against the Accused and called for the defence accordingly.

### The Defence Case

30     The Accused did not deny that he had been given several warnings under s 31(2) of the MDA, and that he had not cooperated even though he had the urge to urine. He also confirmed that he had no bladder control issues at the material time. His defence was that when he tried to give his urine specimen at a later stage, he was denied the chance to do so.

31     The Accused agreed in court that the first five warnings (11.45 a.m., 12.15 p.m., 12.45 p.m., 1.15 p.m. and 1.45 p.m.) had been administered to him and he had signed against them accordingly. He did not provide his urine sample then as he was “controlling” his urine. When he wet his pants and was escorted to the toilet, he admitted to the CNB officers that he had consumed “Mushroom”. He then told them that he would provide his urine sample.

32     However, PW3 Sgt Irwanudin told him to wait while he went out to call a senior officer into the toilet. An unidentified senior officer then entered the toilet, questioned the Accused if he was “playing a game” with them, slapped him and told the officers in the toilet to charge him, before he left. From that point, the CNB officers refused to procure his urine sample though he offered to provide it.

33     The Accused denied that the warning at 2.40 p.m. was ever given to him.

34     At the CGH holding room, the Accused informed one of the officers that he had the urge to urinate. However, the officer told him to stay in the holding room. Not knowing what to do, the Accused then urinated onto the floor.

35     The Accused admitted that he gave his urine sample to the nurse, but denied asking the nurse if the sample was for the doctor or CNB.

36     After giving his evidence in court, the Accused indicated that he wanted to call as witnesses the nurse from CGH who had procured his urine sample, and the AETOS officers who were present at the CGH holding room. As he was unable to locate these witnesses himself, the Prosecution was asked to assist. However, after an adjournment of more than three months, the Prosecution informed the court that they had tried but failed to obtain any relevant records to identify the relevant nurse or AETOS offiers.

37     After this was informed to the Accused, he then applied to recall all the CNB witnesses involved in recording the station diary entries, as he had the following queries for them:

> (a)     He wanted to ask them about the new allegations he was raising pertaining to CNB officers having discarded “Mushroom” in his possession at the time of arrest. In particular, the Accused wanted to recall PW5 Sgt Loh whom he now claimed was the officer who discarded his drugs at the point of arrest;

> (b)     Inconsistencies between the station diary and Summary of Facts prepared in the CCDC process;

> (c)     Clarification regarding how many officers were in the CGH holding room; and

> (d)     When the original station diary was lost.

38     Having considered this application, I rejected it as I found no basis for recalling the witnesses. The Accused had his chance to cross examine them, and the latest queries were not the result of anything new that had cropped up. The questions pertaining to the new allegation of drug disposal were not relevant and the questions pertaining to the Summary of Facts were not questions the witnesses would be in a position to clarify. The other issues pertaining to the CGH holding room incident and the original station diary were not new and were, in my view, not pertinent to the issue at hand. In short, I was of the view that the application was frivolous and rejected it.

## Court’s Findings on the Trial Charge

### Offence was already completed by 1.45 p.m.

39     It is not disputed that PW3 Sgt Irwanudin had formally requested the Accused to provide his urine specimen under s 31(2) of the MDA, on at least four occasions, from 11.45 a.m. to 1.15 p.m.

40     In fact, the Accused essentially admitted that he had failed, without reasonable excuse, to provide his urine sample to CNB officers despite the first five warnings being given[^9]. His defence was that he wanted to do so afterwards, but was denied the chance.

41     I was of the view that the offence was already completed when the Accused first had the urge to urine, but refused to do so despite having been warned under s 31(2). This would be sometime between 11.45 a.m. and 1.45 p.m. when the evidence showed that he could not longer control his urine. The Accused admitted that sometime during this period, he had the urge to urinate, but he deliberately refrained from telling PW3 Sgt Irwanudin about this because he did not want PW3 Sgt Irwanudin to procure a urine sample from him[^10]. There was no reasonable excuse for the Accused not to provide his urine specimen to PW3 Sgt Irwanudin, and he admitted as much.[^11] In fact, in his investigative statement[^12], the Accused admitted that he had consumed “Mushroom” and the reason why he did not provide the officer with his urine sample was because he was scared that his urine would be tested positive for “Mushroom”. He also admitted to this in cross examination.[^13]

42     At trial, the Accused did not raise any issues with his bladder at the material time, and the medical evidence also confirmed this.

### Accused’s account is not credible

43     The Accused’s defence is that when he later wanted to give a urine sample, the CNB officers refused to procure it. However, I did not find this version of events credible, and rejected it.

44     The Accused’s account of a “senior officer” entering the toilet and slapping him is belated and unbelievable. This senior officer was never identified, and the Accused never questioned any of the CNB officers on this incident or put to them that it happened. This was also not something he mentioned in his investigative statements. If indeed this incident had occurred, I would have expected the Accused to be aggrieved and to have mentioned it at some point, either in his statements or at least when he was cross examining the CNB officers.

45     In addition, I could see no reason why the CNB officers would stop trying to procure the Accused’s urine sample at that point. They were all in the toilet and the Accused was going to urinate anyway. I note that the officers had seized both sets of wet clothing (P6 and P7) and sent them for analysis. If they were going to do that, it made more sense to have sent along a urine sample instead and saved themselves the trouble of having to deal with a bathroom situation.

46     As such, I rejected the Accused’s account of events and accepted the evidence given by the CNB officers, which was consistent and credible. I found that the Accused had deliberately and wilfully refused to cooperate by urinating into the urinal instead of into the master bottle at about 2 p.m., and later urinating on the floor of the CGH holding room without waiting for the CNB officers to bring him to a toilet to procure his urine.

47     In any case, I note that even if I were to accept the Accused’s assertions regarding his change of heart at 1.50 p.m., it would not assist him because the offence would have already been completed when he first refused, without reasonable excuse, to give his urine specimen during the time period from 11.45 a.m. to 1.45 p.m.

### Other issues

48     For completeness I will also deal with the following three points which, while not directly relevant to the issue of conviction, were brought up at trial:

> (a)     Was a warning under s 31(2) administered to the Accused at 2.40 p.m. as stated in the station diary, and did the Accused sign to acknowledge this? The copy of the relevant page in the station diary was clearly cut off. I accepted the evidence from PW6 Sgt Zhenfu that he had indeed served the warning on the Accused and the Accused had signed on it. I saw no reason to disbelieve PW6 Sgt Zhenfu. Prior to his entry in the diary, there were already five warnings recorded, with one of them unsigned. There was no need to fabricate an entry at 2.40 p.m.

> (b)     Did the Accused ask the nurse at CGH whether his urine specimen would be given to the CNB before agreeing to provide his urine specimen? As the nurse could not be identified, this was a case of word against word. I accepted the evidence of PW3 Sgt Irwanudin and PW6 Sgt Zhenfu that the Accused had indeed asked this of the nurse. This would have been consistent with the Accused’s behavior throughout the day, which was a staunch refusal to provide the CNB with his urine specimen. In any case, whether or not he had asked this of the nurse was not very pertinent. The undisputed fact that he had managed to provide his urine specimen to CGH with no issues at all, in contrast with all the urine incidents with CNB officers, speaks volumes by itself.

> (c)     While Methamphetamine was found in the exhibit P6, which was the soiled pair of pants and boxers the Accused was wearing when he had his first urinating incident, I did not take this into account. While Methamphetamine was detected in the clothing, I did not think it safe to conclude that this was a result of the Accused’s urine containing Methamphetamine. There could be a whole host of other reasons why the clothing might have been stained with Methamphetamine. I also note the evidence that the pants was provided to the Accused by another hospital which he had been brought to earlier that morning. In any case, the charge faced by the Accused is not one of drug consumption.

### Conclusion

49     Based on the above, I was therefore satisfied that the Prosecution had proven the trial charge against the Accused beyond reasonable doubt, and convicted him accordingly.

## Plead Guilty charges

50     Upon his conviction, the Accused confirmed that he would plead guilty to DAC 903519-2019 and DAC 903520-2019.

### Statement of Facts

51     The salient points in the Statement of Facts, to which the Accused admitted without qualification, are set out below.

52     With effect from 21 March 2018, the Accused was placed under compulsory supervision for 24 months under regulation 15 of the Regulations. He was required to present himself for a urine test at Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional Headquarters every Monday and Friday, commencing on 23 March 2018.

53     However, the Accused failed to present himself for urine tests on a total of 59 occasions. In particular, he contravened the Regulations when he failed to present himself for a urine test on 17 and 21 December 2018 at Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional Headquarters, without any valid reason.

55     The Accused had other records for theft, driving while under disqualification and other traffic related offences.

## Sentence

### Prosecution’s submission on sentence

56     The Prosecution sought a global sentence of eight years and six months, and six strokes of the cane.

57     For the trial charge, the Prosecution asked for a sentence six months more than the minimum, in view of the incoherent defence the Accused put up at trial. The Deputy Public Prosecutor (“DPP”) pointed out that the Accused’s evidence had been riddled with untruths and contradictions, and he had also cast aspersions on the integrity of the CNB officers without any basis. The DPP submitted that this was something the court was entitled to take into account in sentencing.

58     With regard to the charges under regulation 15, the DPP sought a sentence similar to what was previously meted out to the Accused in 2006 for the same offence.

59     Running the sentences for the trial charge and one of the charges under regulation 15 consecutively would give a global term of eight years six months, with six strokes of the cane.

### Mitigation

60     In mitigation, the Accused reiterated that what he had said in court was true, and that the drug which he consumed was “not an LT2 drug”. He expressed remorse for his actions and pleaded for leniency.

### Court’s decision on sentence

61     I agreed that a sentence of more than the mandatory minimum for the trial charge was called for in the present case. While the Accused had a right to claim trial, I found his defence at trial to be inconsistent and spurious. He admitted that he had failed to provide his urine specimen, without reasonable excuse, and said that he “was remorseful” during his closing submissions. At the same time, he went ahead to raise various unsubstantiated allegations against the CNB officers, at one point even applying to recall the whole group of them without any good grounds. His actions gave the impression of somone who knew he had no defence to the trial charge, but was simply claiming trial to delay the inevitable.

62     In these circumstances, I did not think he should be put in the same position as someone who pleaded guilty at first instance.

63     The mandatory minimum sentence for the trial charge was seven years and six strokes of the cane. Bearing the above in mind, I was of the view that a six months uplift was appropriate.

64     With regard to the charges for failure to report for urine test, I noted that the Accused had been sentenced to one year’s imprisonment for the same offence in 2006. Given that the antecedent was quite dated, and also bearing in mind the lengthy sentence for the trial charge and s 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), I was of the view that an uplift from the previous antecedent was not necessary. However, in the spirit of deterrence, a sentence of at least the same length as the previous antecedent was appropriate.

65     In conclusion, I imposed a sentence of seven years and six months imprisonment, and six strokes of the cane for the trial charge, and a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment for each of the charges under reg 15(3)(_f_) of the Regulations.

66     I ordered the sentences for the trial charge and one regulation 15(3)(f) charge to run consecutively. The total sentence is a term of eight years six months imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. I was of the view that this global term did not violate the totality principle and could not be said to be “crushing”, having regard to his records and prospects. The term of imprisonment was ordered to commence from 29 December 2018.
