### District Judge Mathew Joseph:

## Introduction

1       The accused is a Taiwanese national aged 36 years. He together with co-accused Hsieh Teng-Chia (“Hsieh”), Chen You-Jeng (“You-Jeng”) and Huang Ying-Chun (“Huang”), were involved in a transnational criminal syndicate. The syndicate operated a police impersonation scam targeting victims in Singapore. As for the accused, he had made arrangements for Hsieh, Huang and You-Jeng to collect monies from the victim mules and also pass on those monies to others. The accused had also acted as a runner himself. In total, the accused had collected and handed over a total of S$803,000.

> _6_.     _On 27 June 2017 at about 7.41pm, Lee lodged a police report at Bukit Panjang South Neighbourhood Police Post reporting that there were unauthorised debits from his Post Office Savings Bank (“_ **_POSB_** _”) bank accounts._

> _7_.     _On 7 July 2017 at about 10.47pm, Tan lodged a police report at Clementi Neighbourhood Police Centre reporting that there were several unauthorised fund transfers made from his Development Bank of Singapore (“_ **_DBS_** _”) bank account._

> _8_.     _On 1 July 2017 at about 9.44pm, Chan lodged a police report at Bukit Timah Neighbourhood Police Centre reporting that an unauthorised electronic fund transfer had been made from her DBS bank account._

> _9_.     _On 4 July 2017 at about 4.54pm, Lim lodged a police report at Kreta Ayer Neighbourhood Police Post reporting that an unauthorised debit had been made from her POSB bank account._

> _10_.     _On 6 July 2017 at about 4.01pm, Lixi lodged a police report at Jurong West Neighbourhood Police Centre reporting that an unauthorised electronic fund transfer had been made from her bank account._

> _11_.     _On 5 July 2017 at about 7.05pm, Xue lodged a police report at Woodlands East Neighbourhood Police Centre reporting that several unauthorised electronic fund transfers had been made from her DBS bank account._

> _12_.     _On 6 July 2017 at about 5.18pm, Mak lodged a police report at Serangoon Gardens Neighbourhood Police Post reporting that unauthorised electronic fund transfers had been made from her POSB bank accounts._

> **_Background Facts_**

> A.     **_The Police Impersonation Scheme_**

> _13_.     _The victims and the other involved parties received phone calls from persons who claimed that they were officers from Chinese or Singaporean Police authorities. These callers convinced the victims and other involved parties that they were involved in money laundering cases, or in some other serious offences, which were being investigated in China. The victims and other involved parties were told that their bank accounts or bank cards were implicated in these offences._

> _14_.     _The victims were told that they would be prosecuted by the authorities, unless they cooperated with the callers’ purported investigations. Feeling threatened, the victims agreed to cooperate. They were then cheated into providing details relating to their bank accounts which enabled the callers (or their criminal associates) to effect electronic transfers of moneys out of the victims’ accounts without the victim’s knowledge. These details included login credentials to their internet banking accounts and/or One-Time-Passwords (“_ **_OTP_** _”) from their authentication tokens. The details were provided to the callers by the victims who were deceived into believing that the callers were Police officers who needed to conduct investigations in relation to their respective bank accounts._

> _15_.     _The involved parties were similarly pressured into cooperating with the callers’ purported investigations, and were instructed by the callers to withdraw moneys transferred into their respective bank accounts, before handing these moneys over to one of the accused persons. Such involved parties were therefore “victim-mules”. These moneys transferred into the involved parties’ bank accounts were in fact moneys wrongfully transferred from the victims’ bank accounts, after the victims were deceived into providing details in relation to their bank accounts to the callers._

> _16_.     _The above-named victims were therefore victims of criminal conduct, namely, Cheating and Dishonestly Inducing a Delivery of Property under section 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). The said offence is a “serious offence” as defined in section 2 of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and other Serious Offences (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (“_ **_CDSA_** _”) and specified under the Second Schedule, Part I of the CDSA._

> B.     **_Background to the Accused’s Involvement_**

> _17_.     _Sometime in mid-2015, the accused borrowed about NT$400,000 (approximately S$17,847.60) to NT$500,000 (approximately S$22,309.50) from an unlicensed moneylender known as “Dun Zhi” in Taiwan. Sometime in end May 2017 or early June 2017, the accused told “Dun Zhi” that he was unable to service the loan any further as he required money for his father’s medical expenses. “Dun Zhi” then requested the accused to work for him. “Dun Zhi” informed the accused that the job was to collect and hand over monies as instructed in Singapore, and that he would be paid NT$80,000 (approximately S$3,578.44) for his assistance, with expenses and accommodation additionally paid for. The accused agreed and eventually came to Singapore._

> _18_.     _Although the accused did not ask “Dun Zhi” the origin of the monies he was to collect and hand over, he had reasonable grounds to believe that they were derived from criminal conduct as he knew that “Dun Zhi” was operating an unlicensed moneylending business, night clubs, and illegal casinos in Taiwan. The accused then became involved with a trans-national syndicate, which included, among others, Huang, Hsieh and Chen, and which had operatives in Taiwan. On 21 June 2017, the accused arrived in Singapore together with Huang and one Lu Ming Lun. In the course of the accused’s stay in Singapore, he received instructions via a mobile messaging application known as “Telegram”, and also got in touch with relevant syndicate members via the same application._

> **_The First Incident_**

> _19_.     _On 22 June 2017, a sum of S$50,000 had been transferred into Toh’s Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation_ **_(OCBC)_** _bank account XXX, after an unknown caller cheated Lee into providing the login credentials to his POSB bank accounts XXX and XXX. The S$50,000 had been transferred from Lee’s POSB bank accounts into Toh’s bank account._

> _20_.     _That same day, Toh was instructed by the unknown individual, who claimed to be from the Police, to withdraw the sum of S$50,000 from his bank account. Around the same time, the accused received instructions to arrange for the collection of the said sum of money from Toh. The accused arranged for Huang to do the collection and Huang collected the sum of S$50,000 from Toh at Lorong 28 Geylang, Singapore. The accused, upon instruction from an unknown other person, together with Lu Ming Lun, then accompanied Huang to Indus Road, Singapore and handed over the S$50,000 to Lili._

> **_The Second Incident_**

> _21_.     _On 1 July 2017, a sum of S$97,000 was transferred into Chua’s OCBC bank account XXX, after unknown callers cheated both Chan and Lim into providing the login credentials to their respective bank accounts – DBS account XXX and POSB XXX.

On 2 July 2017 after the accused touched down in Singapore, he arranged for Huang to place the money he collected from Chua and Koh on 1 July 2017, at the telephone booth along Lorong 6 Geylang, Singapore. Huang acted as arranged by the accused and the accused received the money from the telephone booth. The money was established to be a total of S$172,000. The accused removed S$7,000 as instructed to hold on to for any unforeseen circumstances._

> _26_.     _On 2 July 2017, an unknown individual accessed Tan’s bank account and made unauthorised electronic transfers of S$25,000 to Koh’s POSB bank account, and S$50,000 to Koh’s OCBC bank account.

>> _iii_)     _One Apple iPhone 6 with gold rear casing._

> _43_.     _All the moneys have been dissipated. No restitution has been made by the accused._

> **_Offence_**

> _44_.     _At all times, the accused had reasonable grounds to believe that that an unknown person had engaged in criminal conduct, and had reasonable grounds to believe that by entering into the arrangement he had entered into, the retention of the said unknown person’s benefits of criminal conduct was facilitated. The accused collected and handed over a total of_ **_S$803,000_** _._

> _45_.     _In acting as he did, the accused has committed one count of the offence under section 44(1)(a) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 65A, 2000 Rev Ed), punishable under section 44(5)(a) of the same Act. “_

## Prescribed Punishment

8       The prescribed punishment for an offence under s 44(1)(a) CDSA and punishable under s 44(5)(a) CDSA is a fine not exceeding S$500,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years, or to both.

## Antecedents

9       The accused was untraced.

## Prosecution submissions

10     The Prosecution submitted for an imprisonment term of 60 months for the accused.

11     DPP Foong submitted that the sentencing framework established in _Huang Ying-Chun v PP \[2018\] SGHC 2018_ should be applied. It was submitted that the level of harm was severe as the amount involved was substantial and involved a total of S$803,000 that had passed through the accused’s hands. DPP Foong further submitted that a criminal syndicate with a transnational element was involved, the underlying predicate offence was serious as it involved a police impersonation scam. In addition, harm was caused to confidence in public administration in Singapore as the reputations of the Singapore Police Force and other law enforcement agencies like Interpol, were tarnished by the syndicate members impersonating law enforcement officers. As for the culpability of the accused, it was submitted that this was in the medium range as the accused had displayed planning and premeditation in his participation in the scam, the criminal enterprise was fairly sophisticated and the accused’s role was not that of a mere runner.

## Mitigation and Defence submissions

12     Defence Counsel Mr Leon Koh, in mitigation stated that the accused was contrite and remorseful for his actions. The accused was the sole breadwinner in his family. His father was suffering from end-stage mouth cancer and he was responsible for his father’s medical bills. As the medical bills were mounting, the accused resorted to loans from moneylenders. Later, when he could not pay the monthly interest sums and informed the moneylenders that he could not make further payments, he was severely beaten up. He was then informed by the moneylenders about a job in Singapore in connection with the moneylenders’ Singaporean business interests. Mr Koh submitted that the accused effectively had no choice in the matter. He had agreed under duress and hoped that in undertaking the job for the moneylenders, he would be able to stop the moneylenders from further physically abusing and harassing him.

13     Mr Koh had in his written submissions initially asked for a sentence of 45 months imprisonment. However, during oral submissions he changed his position and asked for a term of 54 months’ imprisonment instead.

## Sentencing considerations

14     Both Prosecution and Defence agreed that the sentencing framework set out by See J in _Huang Ying-Chun v PP_ should also apply to the accused_._ This was not surprising as Huang was a co-accused in the same transnational criminal syndicate and who had already been sentenced earlier to 66 months’ imprisonment after appeal to the High Court. It was the accused who had made arrangements for runners like Huang to collect monies from the victim-mules and also pass on those monies to others.

15     As mentioned earlier, DPP Foong had submitted that the harm caused by the accused was severe and his culpability was at the medium level. While Mr Koh agreed on the harm categorization as severe, he submitted that the culpability of the accused was only at the low level. I should note at this point, that Mr Koh was also the same defence counsel who had appeared for the co-accused Huang in the High Court appeal of _Huang Ying-Chun v PP._

16     I accordingly applied the sentencing framework set out by See J in _Huang Ying-Chun v PP._

#### (i)   Level of harm and level of culpability

#### (a)   Harm caused by the accused

17     Both Prosecution and Defence agreed that the harm caused by the accused was at the level of severe.

#### (b)   Culpability of the accused

18     As the level of culpability of the accused will have a direct bearing on the sentence of the accused, I proceeded to examine the different submission of parties on this key issue.

19     DPP Foong had submitted that the culpability of the accused was in the _medium_ range. It was submitted that the similar considerations that applied in the co-accused _Huang Ying-Chun v PP’s_ case would also apply to the accused. As such, DPP Foong submitted that the culpability of the accused should similarly be in the _medium r_ange as the accused had displayed planning and premeditation in his participation in the scam, the criminal enterprise was fairly sophisticated and the accused’s role was not that of a mere runner.

20     Mr Koh however submitted that the accused’s level of culpability was in the _low_ range. It was submitted that the accused’s culpability was low as he was not part of the syndicate and had only been forced and/or threatened into doing work for them. At all times, the accused was only carrying out the syndicate’s instructions. It was also submitted that it was only because of the accused having a basic knowledge of English that he was tasked to “arrange” for deliveries and collections. As the accused’s role was purely to convey/relay the instructions from the syndicate, his involvement was very much limited. Mr Koh further submitted that the accused was nowhere near the apex of the syndicate hierarchy. The accused was also only a 2nd or 3rd layer money mule and therefore he did not interact with any of the victims. It was submitted that in view of his ‘limited role’, the accused’s level of culpability was only at the low level.

21     I agreed with the submissions of the Prosecution that the culpability of the accused was in the _medium_ range. In this regard, I am guided by what was stated by See J in _Huang Ying-Chun v PP –_

> “_127\. Although various factors are relevant to this analysis, I consider that the most important consideration_ _is the appellant’s_ **_role_** _in this criminal enterprise_.”

> (Emphasis added)

22     Indeed, an objective and closer scrutiny of the role of the accused displays vividly that he played a more expansive role than that of his co-accused _Huang_ and whose culpability was also in the _medium_ range[^1].

23     From the statement of facts, it is clear that the accused had come to Singapore for the sole purpose of offending[^2]. In my view, the accused knew from the outset that he would be a cash runner. I have noted that although he may not have asked Dun Zhi for the origin of the moneys he was to collect, the charge refers to ‘reasonable grounds’ and the accused therefore had reasonable grounds to believe that the arrangement with Dun Zhi involved the benefits of criminal conduct. This was clearly distinguishable from the case of Huang who had initially been told that he was to deliver _documents_ and only realised after the first collection that he was actually collecting moneys[^3]. There was therefore pre-meditation on the part of the accused in coming to Singapore and this was for the purpose of committing crime. Viewed in this light, the accused’s culpability is higher than that of his co-accused Huang.

24     As mentioned above, Mr Koh had submitted that the accused was nowhere near the apex of the syndicate’s hierarchy and had only played a ‘limited’ role. With respect, I do not think that this is a proper characterisation of the role played by the accused. It must be borne in mind that the accused had played a quite extensive role in the syndicate, especially when compared against the role of Huang. Nor can it be claimed that the accused was a mere minion or even just a foot soldier. The SOF states clearly that the accused was also tasked with receiving and relaying the syndicate’s instructions to other cash runners, and coordinating the collection and delivery of monies.[^4] These were not low-order acts but involved a high level of trust on the part of the syndicate leaders in view of both the nature of the instructions being given and transmitted and also the large amounts of moneys that were being moved, collected and delivered based on instructions given to and carried out by the accused. I am therefore of the firm view that while a label like “_2nd or 3rd layer money mule_” as used by Mr Koh may be helpful, it can also be misleading. What is more important is that a close scrutiny of the actual acts carried out must be embarked upon to determine the level of culpability of the accused. As such, I take the view that when considering the actual acts carried out by the accused, it is clear that his role in the syndicate’s hierarchy was higher when compared with the acts of Huang. This in turn would made his culpability higher.

## Court’s decision

#### (ii)   Applicable indicative sentencing range

25     As mentioned above, I was of the view that the accused’s level of harm caused was severe and his culpability was at the medium level. Under the sentencing framework in _Huang Chi Yun v PP_, the given indicative sentencing range was therefore 60 to 90 months imprisonment.

#### (iii)   Appropriate starting point

26     Under the _Huang Ying-Chun_ sentencing framework, I had to consider next the appropriate starting point in this indicative sentencing range.

27     The Prosecution had submitted that the appropriate starting point should be 66 months’ imprisonment. DPP Foong had noted that in _Huang Ying-Chun_, the appropriate starting point was 72 months’ imprisonment. However, it was noted that while the amount in the present case was lower (S$803,000 as compared to S$957,000 in Huang’s case), the accused’s culpability compared to Huang was _higher_ for two reasons. First, the accused had come to Singapore for the sole purpose of offending. Secondly, the accused’s role in the syndicate was an expansive role and that he was not merely a “foot-soldier”.

28     As for the Defence submissions on culpability of the accused, I had considered Mr Koh’s submissions for a lower culpability than _Huang._ For the reasons given at paragraphs \[21\] to \[24\] above, I was not persuaded by Mr Koh’s arguments. Accordingly, I accepted the submissions of DPP Foong that the accused’s culpability was higher than that of _Huang_.

29     For the reasons above and also noting that the amount in the present case was _lower_ at S$803,000 as compared to the sum of S$957,000 in Huang’s case, I agreed with DPP Foong’s submission that the appropriate starting point in the indicative sentencing range should be 66 months’ imprisonment.

#### (iv)   Adjustments to starting point for offender-specific factors

30     There was only one factor to consider here. As the accused had pleaded guilty, DPP Foong accepted that an appropriate discount should be given. Mr Koh had also argued for a appropriate discount given that the accused had pleaded guilty. I agreed with both parties.

#### (v)   Further adjustments to take into account the totality principle

31     This was not necessary as the accused was convicted of only a single charge in this case.

## Sentence to be imposed

#### Court’s decision

32     DPP Foong submitted that applying the _Huang Ying-Chun_ sentencing framework, a sentence of 60 months’ imprisonment would be fair and reasonable in all the circumstances.

33     Mr Koh had submitted initially for 45 months’ imprisonment in his written submissions. However, during oral submissions Mr Koh changed his position and submitted that 54 months would be appropriate.

34     In this regard, DPP Foong had informed the court that the co-accused Hsieh Teng-Chia was sentenced to 33 months imprisonment. The other co-accused Chen You-Jeng was sentenced to 36 months imprisonment. Both these 2 co-accused received much lower sentences than Huang Ying-Chun as the sums involved in their respective charges were much lower.

35     DPP Foong had also referred in her written submissions to a table of sentencing precedents of cases that were heard post _Huang Ying-Chun v PP. H_owever, DPP Foong emphasised in particular, the District Court case of PP _v Tan Kim Hui_ as this was closer to the facts of the present case involving the accused Cheng. The case of _PP v Tan Kim Hui_ was a case that was also heard after the _Huang Ying-Chun v PP_ appeal decision and similarly involved a police impersonation scam.

36     DPP Foong submitted that in _PP v Tan Kim Hui_, the offender Tan had travelled from Malaysia to Singapore, after being told of an opportunity to earn money whereby he would be paid to collect proceeds of the syndicate’s criminal conduct. It was noted that in total, Tan travelled to Singapore on 14 occasions over 3 months and had collected a total of S$759,181.50, which he thereafter handed over to the syndicate in Malaysia. DPP Foong further noted that Tan was paid between RM 200 and RM 1,500 for each trip. It was also submitted that in respect of the last two proceeded charges, Tan had _actual knowledge_ (as opposed to reasonable grounds to believe) that the cash he handled were benefits of criminal conduct. Applying the sentencing framework in _Huang Ying-Chun_, the District Judge had sentenced Tan to 54 months’ imprisonment. DPP Foong however highlighted in her oral submissions that Tan was a mere runner in the syndicate. As such, this was in contrast to the present accused Cheng who had played a far more expansive role in the syndicate, and was also higher up in the syndicate’s hierarchy. For these reasons, DPP Foong submitted that the accused’s sentence should accordingly be calibrated upwards from Tan’s sentence of 54 months’ imprisonment to reflect the greater culpability of the accused Cheng in this respect.

37     Mr Koh however disagreed and submitted that the accused’s culpability should be the same as that of _Tan Kim Hui._ The accused should therefore also be sentenced to 54 months’ imprisonment. I note that in his written submissions, Mr Koh had submitted for a starting point of 51 months imprisonment. Further, after the discount for the accused having pleaded guilty, Mr Koh had submitted for 45 months in his written submissions. As mentioned earlier at \[33\], during oral submissions Mr Koh changed his position and asked for a sentence of 54 months imprisonment instead.

38     For completeness, I should also add that Mr Koh had raised an _additional two point_s during his oral submissions. First, he had submitted that although the charge stated that the period of offending was between 22 June and 7 July 2017, the accused returned to Taiwan on 23rd June and only returned to Singapore on 30th June. His actual period of offending was therefore _not_ 16 days but only 8 days. I note that the Prosecution did not dispute this assertion by the Defence that the actual period of offending was therefore not 16 days but only 8 days.

39      Second, Mr Koh had submitted in reply to DPP Foong’s submissions concerning the case of _Tan Kim Hui v PP_, that the facts in the present case could be distinguished. As this case was cited and relied upon by DPP Foong to justify a sentence of 60 months’ imprisonment for the accused, I decided to consider carefully and evaluate what Mr Koh had submitted by way of distinguishing the case of _Tan Kim Hui v PP_ and thereby to submit for a lower sentence of 54 months imprisonment instead of the 60 months imprisonment asked for by DPP Foong.

40     In his oral submission. Mr Koh emphasised that the offender Tan had travelled to Singapore on _14 occasions over 3 months_ and had collected a total of S$759,181.50. He submitted that in comparison, the accused Cheng had only entered Singapore on a mere 2 occasions over 8 days or even if the period in the charge was accepted, a total period of 16 days only compared to the _3 months_ that the offender Tan had spent in Singapore carrying out his offending acts. As such, the harm caused to confidence in public administration in Singapore as Tan’s case was also a police impersonation scam, was considerably _greater_ when compared to the facts involved in the case of the accused Cheng. When queried by the court for her response, DPP Foong did not strongly dispute that greater harm was involved in Tan’s case as the acts spanned a period of 3 months.

41     Having considered Mr Koh’s oral submission above, I was in agreement that the harm caused to confidence in public administration in Singapore was higher than that in the case of the present accused Cheng all considered. I took this view after noting that the sum involved in Tan’s case was also lower at $759,181.50

42     In view of the reasons given above, I was of the view that a fair and appropriate sentence considering all the facts and surrounding circumstances and also the cited case of _Tan Kim Hui v PP_, was a sentence of 58 months’ imprisonment for the charge on which the accused was convicted. I am also of the view that this sentence is neither manifestly excessive nor manifestly inadequate.

43     The accused was sentenced to 58 months imprisonment. He has appealed against his sentence.

44     The accused is presently serving sentence.
