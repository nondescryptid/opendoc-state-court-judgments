Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9434/2020/01.\]

30 July 2020

### District Judge Christopher Goh Eng Chiang:

## Introduction

1       This is an appeal by the Prosecution against an order of Probation.

2       The Accused pleaded guilty to a single charge under s 5(1)(c)(i) punishable under s 17(2) of the Official Secrets Act (Chapter 213) (“OSA”). On 3 November 2018, he sent four photographs that he had knowingly obtained in contravention of the OSA to five other individuals in a WhatsApp Group Chat without authorisation. The photographs showed a Singapore Armed Forces (“SAF”) training accident involving a Bionix Infantry Fighting Vehicle (“Bionix”) and a Land Rover.

## Facts

3       The Accused admitted to Joint Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification. The facts are relatively straightforward.

4       The Accused, then 20 years of age, was a full-time National Serviceman (“NSF”) serving in the Singapore Civil Defence Force (“SCDF”) holding the rank of Sergeant 1 and attached to Jurong Fire Station.

5       On 3 November 2018, at about 1020 hrs, the Accused, together with one Muhammad Arif Bin Azman (“Arif”) and Mohamad Haikal Bin Mohd Zainal Abiddin (“Haikal”), were dispatched to the site of an SAF training accident at the Murai Urban Training Facility involving a Bionix and a Land Rover that resulted in the death of a soldier.

6       At the site, Arif and Haikal used their personal mobile telephones to take two and three pictures respectively of the accident. None of the photographs showed the deceased. The Accused himself did not take any photograph.

7       After rendering the assistance at the accident site, they returned to Jurong Fire Station at about 1400 hrs. Arif and Haikal then sent the photographs that they had taken to a Whatapp Chat Group comprising of 24 present and former SCDF personnel, including the Accused and two others, namely, Brandon Tan Jien Jet (“Brandon”) a serving NSF at Jurong Fire Station and Muhammad Zaki Bin Haji Mokhtar (“Zaki”) a former NSF who had served at Jurong Fire Station.

8       Having received the photographs of the accident site from Arif and Haikal, the Accused, despite knowing the sensitive nature of the photographs and that he was not authorised to communicate them to his friends, nonetheless shared them with five other friends from another WhatsApp Chat Group, all whom were serving NSFs from other camps. He had sent the photographs, as he wanted to show them what happened and to gossip.

9       The SCDF became aware that photographs of the accident scene were being circulated on WhatsApp. Accordingly, the entire complement of ROTA 3, Jurong Fire Station were recalled and interviewed. It was then ascertained that Arif and Haikal had taken and circulated the photographs of the accident scene and that Brandon, Zaki and the Accused had further disseminated these photographs to their friends and family.

10     Accordingly, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him on the single charge.

## Antecedents

11     The Accused has no antecedents.

## Submissions on sentence

### Prosecution’s submissions

12     The Prosecution’s submission was for a fine of $1,500 to be imposed. It was submitted that the dominant sentencing principle was one of deterrence and not the rehabilitation of the Accused. This was in light of the nature of the offence committed, namely one under the OSA. In addition, the offence was committed because of a lapse of judgement on the part of the Accused, under very specific circumstances due to the Accused’s particular posting during his National Service (“NS”). There was a very low risk of this sort of incident happening again in the future, hence, a low risk of re-offending. Hence, it was submitted that probation ought not be an option that the court should consider.

13     It was highlighted that two of the other co-accused persons were also under 21 years of age when the offence was committed and above 21 years of age when they were sentenced. They were both convicted and fined $1,500 per charge. This particular case did not therefore warrant a departure from the sentences that had been imposed on the other co-accused persons.

14     The Prosecution also referred to three sentencing precedents involving similar OSA charges. The three accused persons were involved in the same incident.

15     In _Public Prosecutor v Nurizzah Afiqah binte Hussain_ (DAC-946310-2017 & Ors) (“_Nurizzah_”), the accused, a paramedic working for a private ambulance company pleaded guilty to two charges under s 5(1)(c)(i) punishable under s 17(2) of the OSA. In a suicide incident, the accused took a photograph of the SCDF Call Sheet and sent it to her boyfriend, _Fazli_. Then, at the scene, she helped her colleague, _Haqiz_, take a photograph of the deceased’s body by shining a torchlight on the hanging body. Later, when _Haqiz_ forwarded her the photograph, she forwarded it to her boyfriend.

16     An additional charge of sending the photograph of the SCDF Call Sheet to 18 colleagues was taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. The accused was fined $1,500 for each of the two proceeded charges.

17     In _Public Prosecutor v Shaik Haziq Fahmi Bin Shaik Nasair Johar_ (DAC-946308-2017) (“_Haziq_”), the accused worked together with _Nurizzah_ as an ambulance driver. The accused was the one who took the photograph of the deceased’s hanging body and sent it to a WhatsApp chat group comprising of paramedics, including _Nurizzah_. He pleaded guilty and was fined $1,500.

18     In _Public Prosecutor v Fazli Hisham bin Mohd Fairuz Shah_ (DAC-946306-2017 & Anor) (“_Fazli_”), the accused, the boyfriend of _Nurizzah_, was convicted after a trial on two similar OSA charges. Upon the receipt of the two photographs, he forwarded them to his friends, one of which forwarded it to others who in turn posted the photographs on Facebook. He was fine $1,500 per charge.

### Mitigation plea

19     The Defence Counsel submitted that a Probation Suitability Report (“PSR”) should be called.[^1]. The Accused was under 21 years old at the time when the offence was committed and 21 ½ years at the time of sentencing. It was therefore submitted that the primary sentencing consideration should be that of rehabilitation as the Accused was a youthful offender.

20     At \[29\] of the Mitigation Plea, the Defence summarized the exceptional circumstances in the present case. These included:

> (a)     the young age of the Accused at the time of the offence;

> (b)     the fact that the Accused was not the main offender;

> (c)     the lack of antecedents;

> (d)     close operation with the police;

> (e)     strong familial support;

> (f)     acknowledgement of his wrongdoing and remorse for his actions.

## Probation Report

21     When dealing with a youthful offender, the court would generally call for PSR and would not embark on an assessment of the offenders suitability for probation without the benefit of such a report: _A Karthik v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 1289</span> at \[20\] (_“Karthik_”); _Wong Shan Shan v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGHC 49</span> at \[19\] – \[21\].

22     Therefore, notwithstanding the Prosecution’s objections, I was of the view that it would be appropriate to call for a PSR.

23     The Accused was found suitable for probation. The Probation Officer (“PO”) recommended that the Accused be placed on six months supervised probation. In addition, he would be required to perform 60 hours of community service and his parents were also required to sign a bond to ensure his good behaviour during the period of probation.

24     The Prosecution maintained their objections to a probation order being made and continued to submit that the appropriate sentence was a fine of $1,500.

## Punishment Prescribed by Law

25     The punishment prescribed by law for an offence under s 5(1)(c)(i) of the OSA, can be found in s 17(2), which provides that a person shall be liable:

> (a)     on conviction before a District Court to a fine not exceeding $2,000 and to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years; or

> (b)     on conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,000 and to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months if tried before a Magistrate’s Court with the consent of the Public Prosecutor.

## Sentencing Considerations

### Preliminary matters – parity in sentencing

26     The Prosecution had urged the _Court “not to depart from the sentences that had been imposed for the 4 other co-accused persons, which is a fine of $1,500”_.[^2] I presumed that this referred to parity in the sentences imposed on the four co-accused persons. Each of them were fined _$1,500 per charge_ and the facts of their cases are summarized below:

27     Two of the co-accused persons, Brendan and Haikal, were, like the Accused, under 21 years old when the offence(s) were committed and above 21 years old when they were sentenced. Both of whom were represented by counsel. A review of the notes of evidence and the written pleas in mitigation showed that at no time did their respective counsel seek probation for their clients, for reason best known to themselves. The fact that the they chose not to seek probation should not preclude the court in the present case from considering it as an appropriate sentence to impose.

28     In the instant case, the Court would not have been able to impose a fine of $1,500. The classification of the charge was that of a Magistrate’s Arrest Case (“MAC”) charge. Therefore, the maximum fine the Court could have imposed was $1,000 as prescribed for in s 17(2) OSA.

29     As mentioned, the four co-accused, namely Arif, Haikal, Brendon and Zaki were each fined $1,500 per charge. From the notes of evidence, this was the fine submitted by the Prosecution. However, I note the four co-accused persons also faced MAC charges. Therefore, the maximum fine that could have been imposed by the Court was $1,000 and not $1,500 per charge. I understand that the Attorney-General’s Chambers has been informed and the necessary steps have are being taken to rectify this.

### The governing sentencing principles for young offenders

30     I next touch upon the governing sentencing principles for young offenders.

31     It is well established that the law takes the presumptive view that, in the sentencing of youthful offenders, the primary sentencing consideration is rehabilitation. This is justified based on the retrospective rationale and the prospective rationale which underlie the presumptive primacy of rehabilitation in relation to youthful offenders: see _Karthik_ at \[43\]-\[46\].

32     Like the accused in _Karthik_, the Accused in the instant case was below 21 years of age when the offence was committed (albeit not as young as in _Karthik_) but was just over 21 years old at the time when he was sentenced. As such, the retrospective rationale would continue to apply given his age at the time of the offence.

33     In _Karthik_ at \[65\]-\[67\], Sunderesh Menon CJ laid down the relevant sentencing approach to be taken for young offenders. At the first stage, the court is concerned with the threshold question of whether rehabilitation retains its primacy in the sentencing matrix. While the dominant consideration for youthful offenders is presumptively rehabilitation, its primacy can be diminished by the circumstances of the case or even eclipsed by considerations such as deterrence or retribution. This tends to be the position where: (a) the offence is serious; (b) the harm caused is severe; (c) the offender is hardened and recalcitrant; and/or (d) the conditions which make rehabilitative sentencing options such as probation or reformative training viable do not exist.

34     As regards to the last mentioned factor, when considering whether or not the conditions which make rehabilitative sentencing options viable exist may also be affected by the other considerations such as (a) the nature of the rehabilitation best suited for the offender; (b) the availability of familial support for the offender’s rehabilitative efforts; and (c) any other special reasons or need for rehabilitation.

35     At the second stage of the framework, the court must then select the appropriate sentence in view of the primary sentencing considerations identified and prioritised at the first stage. Where rehabilitation is the dominant sentencing consideration, probation would be one of the typical options at the court’s disposal, given that probation places rehabilitation at the front and centre of the court’s deliberation.

### Applying the principles

36     With the above sentencing principles in mind, I now turn to the factual matrix of the present case.

#### Seriousness of the offence

37     The seriousness of an offence (or lack thereof) may be determined by the punishment prescribed by law. For example, in _Karthik_, the accused was convicted of one count of abetting, by conspiracy, the cheating of a motor insurance company under s 420 read with s 116 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”). The accused was part of a motor insurance scam that lodged fraudulent claims with insurance companies for “injuries’ suffered in staged accidents. The offence carried a maximum imprisonment of 10 years and a fine: see _Karthik_ at \[70\].

38     The offence here is one committed under the s 5 of the OSA. As an MAC charge, the maximum punishment that can be imposed by a Magistrate is a fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or both. Looking at the punishment prescribed by law for the offence would suggest that this charge, in the wider scheme of things, was not as serious as that faced by the accused in _Karthik_.

39     Even within the offences prescribed in the OSA, this particular offence is not among the most serious in terms of the prescribed punishment. In fact, it would also appear that the Prosecution has also assessed that the offence committed by the Accused was less serious than the offence(s) committed in _Nurrizah_, _Haziq_ and _Fazli._ In _Nurrizah_, _Haziq_ and _Fazli_, the Prosecution had opted to have the cases determined by a district judge by classifying the charges as _District Arrest Cases_ (“DAC”) charges notwithstanding that the offence(s) were similar to that faced by the Accused in the present case.

40     However, I would not go so far to say that this offence was not serious at all in light of the aims of the OSA. Considering all these factors, I would not assess this particular offence under s 5 of the OSA as a serious one. Taken at its highest, however, I would only say that this offence is one that is much less serious than one under s 420 of the PC faced by the accused in _Karthik._

#### Culpability of the Accused / harm caused

41     I also assessed that the culpability of the Accused to be on the lower end. While the Accused had attended at the scene, he did not take any photographs. It was Arif and Haikal who did so. Although the Accused did forward the photographs when he ultimately received them, he had done so _impulsively_ to five of his close school friends who were all also serving their NS, albeit not in the SCDF.

42     In fact, one of the recipients of the photographs was himself a Land Rover driver. The Accused had forwarded the photographs with the _“main intention of highlighting the importance of exercising care and vigilance, especially during SAF training_”.[^3] There was no malicious intent on his part. I accepted this explanation.

43     I was of the view that the harm caused, if any, was on the low side. The four photographs do not show the unfortunate soldier who died in the training accident. Neither could the location of the accident be easily discernible from the photographs. Whilst the vehicle number of the Land Rover could be seen from one of the photographs, it would be extremely difficult to determine whom the vehicle was assigned to for this particular training exercise.

44     In contrast, the factual matrix in the three precedents referred to by the Prosecution showed not only showed that the accused persons’ in those cases were clearly more culpable but the acts more egregious.

45     For example, in _Nurizzah_, the accused not only took a photograph of the SCDF Call Sheet and forwarded it to her boyfriend, she also helped _Haziq_ take a photograph of the deceased by shining a torchlight on the hanging body. Upon receipt of the photographs, _Fazli_ then forwarded them to a much larger group of people. These photographs eventually found their way onto the social media platforms allowing a lot more people to view them. There was a higher likelihood of the family or friends of the deceased would be able to see these photographs online.

#### Conditions making rehabilitative sentencing a viable option

46     From the PSR prepared by the PO, I noted that the conditions that make rehabilitation sentencing a viable option were present in this case.

47     The Accused has strong familial support. He has a close and warm relationship with his parents and an amicable relationship with his two younger siblings. His parents were willing to work with the PO and authorities to ensure he abides by the probation conditions and to steer clear from re-offending. The PO has therefore opined that this positive relationship can serve as a source of motivation to keep him out of further trouble.

48     Overall, there has been a positive feedback regarding his performance in NS[^4]. The Accused was described to be a well-motivated individual who adhered to rules and regulations. His offence appeared to be a lapse in judgement and consequential thinking. He has shown insight to his offending behaviour and was able to suggest alternative means to meet his objectives without running afoul of the law. He has acknowledged that his acts were wrong and was remorseful.

### Other Factors Considered

49     The Prosecution’s submissions further appeared to suggest that in the event that probation is ordered, there would be little or no deterrent effect. This, in my view, would not be correct. While the primary aim of probation is in the realm of rehabilitation, an order of probation still carries with it a form of deterrence.

50     In the instant case, the Accused would have to abide by a time restriction and required to do 60 hours of community service within the period of probation ordered. Together with the bond for his good behaviour that his parents would have to sign, this would undoubtedly posed a greater deterrent effect on the Accused as his “sentence” would, in effect, last for 6 months. In contrast, a fine imposed would in all probability be paid for by his parents and would be unlikely to have a deterrent effect on the accused.

51     I also disagreed with the Prosecution that there was no rehabilitative need in this case as the offence was not one that required criminal thought. The PSR highlighted that the Accused _“involvement in the offence appeared to be lapse in judgement and consequential thinking”._ Probation will allow the Accused to improve on his consequential thinking and part of the probation case management plan is to _“guide Yu Xuan on responsible use of social media, especially when it concerns sensitive of confidential information….”_.[^5]

## Conclusion

52     I am of the view that, while the presumptive primacy of rehabilitation in relation to youthful offender in the instant case had not been eclipsed by other considerations such as deterrence or retribution.

53     Whilst the aim of probation is to rehabilitate an offender, in particular a youthful one, it still does carry with it, albeit to a lesser degree, a deterrent effect. The accused is young and has good prospects ahead. This episode would undoubtedly remain with him throughout his life and I hope that this period of probation will help him improve his consequential thinking and make him a valuable member of society in the future.

54     I therefore adjudged probation to be the most appropriate option in this instant. Accordingly, I ordered, as recommended by the PO, that the Accused undergo supervised probation for a period of 6 months. In addition, I also ordered the following, as conditions of probation:

> (a)     the Accused was to remain indoors between 2200 hrs – 0600 hrs unless otherwise varied by the Probation Services Branch, in accordance with the guidelines approved by the Court;

> (b)     the Accused was to perform 60 hours of community service; and

> (c)     the parents were to execute a bond in the sum of $1,000 to ensure good behaviour during the period of probation.

55     The Prosecution, being dissatisfied with the order of probation imposed on the Accused has appealed against it. The order of probation has therefore been stayed pending the outcome of this appeal.
