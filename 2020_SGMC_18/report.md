\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9314/2019/01.\]

30 March 2020

### District Judge Christopher Goh Eng Chiang:

## I.   INTRODUCTION

1       This is an appeal against sentence by the Accused.

2       The Accused, a 30 year-old male Singaporean, pleaded guilty to two charges under s.182 of the Penal Code (“PC”), for giving false information to two different police officers on 6 April 2017. The first occasion was at about 0340 hrs along Raffles Boulevard and the second at about 0715 hrs at 10 Ubi Avenue 3, Traffic Police Headquarters (“TPHQ”)

## II.   FACTS OF THE CASE

3       The Accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification. The facts are relatively straightforward.

4       On 5 April 2017 at about 2300 hrs, the Accused, one Cheo Ming Xiang (‘Cheo”) and several other friends had gone to a KTV lounge for drinks. When the left the KTV lounge at about 0200 hrs, the Accused sat in the front passenger seat of motorcar SKV502Y driven by Cheo. Another friend, one Zhang Yan Yu, was seating in the rear passenger seat.

5       At about 0300 hrs, whilst Cheo was driving along Raffles Boulevard, he collided into the rear of a motor taxi SHC5898H when he failed to stop his motor vehicle in time at a signalised traffic light junction when the lights turned red. No one was injured.

6       At about 0340 hrs, Police Staff Sergeant Tan Wei Siong (“SSG Tan”) from TP arrived at the scene. The Accused identified himself as the driver of SKV502Y and informed SSG Tan that while he was driving SKV502Y, he was unable to brake in time when the traffic light turned red and had collided into the rear of the motor taxi. The Accused knew that he was giving false information and the intention was to case SSG Tan to omit conducting investigations against Cheo for a potential offence under s.67(1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act, Cap 276 (“RTA”).

7       SSG Tan proceeded to conduct a breathalyzer test on the Accused. He failed the test and was placed under arrest. He was escorted to TP HQ where a BEA test was administered. His breath alcohol level was found to be 43 ug/ 100 ml. Because of the Accused’s actions, traffic police did not conduct a breathalyser test on Cheo that morning. Cheo was also not arrested and neither was a statement recorded from him.

8       At about 0715 hrs on 6 April 2017, at TPHQ, Sergeant Muhammad Firdhaus bin Suleiman (“SGT Firdhaus”) recorded a statement from the Accused. In that statement, the Accused falsely stated that he was the driver of the said motor vehicle as he wanted to test drive Cheo’s Maserati. He admitted that he had drunk alcohol and falsely stated that he was unable to brake in time when the motor taxi braked due to the change in the traffic light signal. Therefore, he collided into the rear of the motor taxi. The Accused gave this information which he knew was false with the intention to cause SGT Firdhaus to omit conducting investigations against Cheo for the potential offences under s.67(1)(b) of the RTA.

9       On 10 April 2017, the Accused went to TPHQ where he admitted to SGT Firdhaus that Cheo was, in fact the driver of motor car SKV502Y on 6 April 2017.

## III.   ANTECEDENTS

10     The Accused has no antecedents.

## IV.   SUBMISSIONS ON SENTENCE

### A.   Prosecution’s Submission

11     The Prosecution submitted that the principles set out by the High Court in **_Koh Yong Chiah v PP_** _<span class="citation">\[2017\] 3 SLR 447</span>_ (“_Koh Yong Chiah_”) applied in the instant case. The accused had shielded his friend from a potential dink driving charge under s.67(1)(b) of the RTA. By the time he re-canted, even if it were the next day, it would no longer be possible to take the breath (or blood) alcohol content of Cheo. Accordingly, there was “appreciable” harm caused by the Accused’s false statements and that the custody threshold was crossed.

12     To determine the appropriate sentence, a table of sentencing precedents for s.182 Penal Code offences of a similar nature was tendered, namely, where an offender shielded another from prosecution. A summary of the cases is set out below:

13     Based on these cases, the Prosecution submitted that an imprisonment term of between 1-3 weeks’ imprisonment was the appropriate sentence

### B.   Plea in Mitigation & Submission on Sentence by the Defence

#### i.   Plea in Mitigation

14     The Defence tendered a written plea in mitigation. The mitigating factors are summarised as follows:

> (a)      The lies were simple and spontaneous. The lie to SSG Tan at the scene was spontaneous and he did not consider the full ramifications of his words. By the time he was interviewed by the IO at TPHQ, the Accused was exhausted, inebriated by alcohol and wanted to help Cheo, therefore, he largely repeated what he told SSG Tan at the scene;

> (b)      Voluntary and early admission. The Accused had confessed after only 2 days. On 6 April, he went straight home after being bailed out. There, he slept until the next day, 7 April, and thereafter went to work. On 8 April, a Saturday, at about 1630 hrs, he decided to go to TP HQ to confess but was told by the guardhouse that TPHQ was closed. He called the IO and admitted that he was the driver. He was told to return to TPHQ on Monday, 10 April. He also pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity;

> (c)      Relationship with Cheo. His impulsive action was motivated by a purely altruistic but misguided desire to help a very close friend;

> (d)      First offender and person of good character. In addition to being a first offender, the Accused had also pleaded guilty at an early stage. The Defence also highlighted the various acts of contributing towards the poor and needy.

#### ii.   Defence Submission on Sentence

15     The Defence agreed that the principles in _Koh Yong Chiah_ applied. However, it was submitted that the custody threshold was not crossed. The reasons cited by the Accused were as follows[^1]:

> (a)     No harm was caused by the falsehood. Even if there were any harm (actual or potential), at it’s highest, such harm was _de minimis_. There was no appreciable harm as the accused quickly recanted at the earliest opportunity. There was no impact on the investigative process and any expenditure of time or resources by the police, if at all, would be of a low degree;

> (b)     The authorities did not need to take any steps to uncover the falsehood as the Accused made early and voluntary admissions. He identified the actual driver and assisted in inviting Cheo to the police station for Cheo’s statement to be recorded;

> (c)     There was no personal gain by the Accused and the offence was not committed at Cheo’s behest.

16     When assessing the Accused’s level of culpability, the court was urged to consider the following[^2]:

> (a)     The false statements were furnished spontaneously and without pre-meditation;

> (b)     No active, deliberate steps were taken to bolster the deception;

> (c)     No malicious motive. It was innocuous with altruistic intention;

> (d)     The span of time between the making of the 2 false statements was short and did not instigate or involve any other person.

17     In terms of assessing the level of culpability, the defence highlighted the following[^3]:

> (a)     The false statements were recanted voluntarily and within a short space of time;

> (b)     The gravity of the predicate offence which the accused shielded Cheo from was at the lower end of the scale of road traffic offences;

> (c)     Investigative resources unnecessarily expended was minimal and any harm _di minimis_;

> (d)     No innocent victim involved.

18     The defence is therefore urging the court to impose the maximum fine of $5,000 for each charge for a global sentence of a $10,000 fine.

## V.   PUNISHMENT PRESCRIBED BY LAW

19     Section 182 of the Penal Code provides that :

> _“ Whoever gives to any public servant any information which he knows or believes to be false, intending thereby to cause, or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby cause, such public servant to use the lawful power of such public servant to the injury or annoyance of any person, or to do or omit anything which such public servant ought not to do or omit if the true state of facts respecting which such information is given were known by him_, **_shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine which may extend to $5,000, or with both._**_”_

## VI.   SENTECING CONSIDERATIONS

20     In the seminal case of **_Koh Yong Chiah v PP_** _<span class="citation">\[2017\] 3 SLR 447</span>_, a 3 member panel of the High Court identified and examined the various situations under which the making of a false statement under s.182 could arise including a situation where a person gives false information to the authorities to shield another person from investigation or prosecution.

21     As the Court was of the view that given the broad nature of the s.182 offence, it could do no more than provide some broad guidance as to the type of case that would generally attract a custodial sentence. At \[50\], Chao Hick Tin JA (as he then was), in delivering the judgement of the Court observed that whether

> _“the custodial threshold is crossed should essentially be determined based on the degree of harm caused or likely to be caused by the s.182 offence ….. \[S\]pecifically if appreciable harm may be caused by the s.182 offence, the courts should, as a starting point, impose a custodial term”._

22     The range of harm that may ensue include:

> (i)     Personal injury (_eg_, by causing another to contract HIV);

> (ii)     loss of liberty (_eg_, by causing another to be unjustifiably arrested);

> (iii)     financial loss (_eg_, by lying to facilitate the misappropriation of property or to commit insurance fraud);

> (iv)     harm arising from the wastage of public investigative resources.

23     At \[51\], the court proceeded to add certain qualifications to this range of harm. This included that the:

> (i)     harm must be _causally connected_ to the provision of the false information;

> (ii)     harm in question must be more than _de minimis_;

> (iii)     harm refers to both actual and potential;

> (iv)     the duration that the falsehood was maintained;

> (v)     the “appreciable” harm test is not one that could be applied with scientific precision and there will be many cases on the borderline. The sentencing court must still ultimately exercise its discretion on the facts of each case

24     Finally, once this test provides the sentencing court with a starting point, then, other sentencing factors should be taken into account to determine whether the starting point should be departed from and what the appropriate quantum of fine / length of imprisonment term should be.

### A.   Whether the custody threshold was crossed – “appreciable” harm

25     While it may be true that the police did not need to take any steps to uncover the falsehood as the Accused had voluntary admitted being the driver, I was of the view that this was not “early” admission of wrongdoing. Taken at the highest, the Accused recanted after slightly more than two days on 8 April when he called the IO to admit that Cheo was the driver. However, whether the period of two days was a “short space of time” or not is dependent on the facts of each case.

26     In this case, the offence, which the accused was trying to shield Cheo from, was a potential drink driving charge. In such cases, one important piece of evidence that is required by the police is a potential defendant’s breath (or blood) alcohol content. This would have to be done as soon as possible. By not recanting his false statement for more than two days, it deprived the police from obtaining this critical piece of evidence, as Cheo breath (or blood) could no longer be tested for alcohol content after more than 2 days. Therefore, in my view, two days in this instant was not a “short space of time”.

27     I do not think that it is entirely accurate to say that the Accused admitted to the offence at the “earliest opportunity” that he could do so, namely in the late afternoon of Saturday 8 April. According to the Accused, he slept throughout 6 April and went to work on 7 April. On 8 April, he called the IO and identified Cheo as the driver at about 1630 hrs[^4]. I do not see how this could be described as the “earliest opportunity” he had to admit his wrongdoing. He had every opportunity to call the IO to admit his wrongdoing from the moment he was released on bail. There was no necessity to wait until 8 April, even if he had to go to work.

28     Furthermore, I did not accept that this offence was “_at the lower end of the scale of road traffic offences_[^5]”. A drink driving offence is, in my view, a serious charge. For a second offender, it attracts a mandatory imprisonment term, a mandatory fine and a mandatory term of disqualification[^6]. The public interest in ensuring that our roads are safe from the scourge of drink drivers by taking them to court cannot be overstated.[^7]

29     The Defence has submitted that the time spent by the police looking into the matter would have been from the time that the police arrived at the scene at approximately 0420 hrs until about 1230 hrs, when the Accused was released on bail, a period of only about 8 hrs and 20 minutes. This takes a simplistic view of police investigations. Investigations continue even after an Accused is released on bail. In fact, in this case, even after the Accused admitted to his wrongdoing, the police would still have to exercise due diligence to establish which version of events as told by the Accused was the true version.

30     Therefore, I disagreed with the Defence. There was appreciable harm caused by the Accused as a consequence of his false statements. It was not minor, and it was certainly more than just _de minimis._ By shielding Cheo from prosecution, the Accused had perverted the course of justice. Accordingly, I adjudged that the custody threshold was crossed.

### B.   The Appropriate Sentence

31     The Prosecution had submitted a sentence of between 1 to 3 weeks imprisonment. From the cases highlighted to the court at \[12\], where an offender shielded another from prosecution, the sentence(s) imposed have ranged from 1 weeks’ imprisonment to 5 weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $1,000.

32     A closer look would suggest that the actual sentencing range was more likely a term of imprisonment of between one to two weeks. In the cases where the court imposed a sentence of more than two week’s imprisonment, the facts were more aggravated. For example, In _PP v Walter Sivaprakash s/o Narayansamy_, the offender was sentenced to 5 weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $1,000 for each of the two charges, with the terms’ of imprisonment to run consecutively. On appeal, the High Court maintained the sentence imposed by the trial court but ordered the terms of imprisonment to run concurrently. The offender in _Walter Sivaprakash_ had showed no remorse in persisting with his falsehoods in claiming trial to the charges. In _PP v Perabu Perev_, the offender was sentenced to 3 weeks’ imprisonment. However, the facts reveal that this was not a straightforward case of one shielding another from prosecution. The co-offender had named the offender as the driver in an accident. When questioned by the police, he confirmed the co-offender’s. Subsequent investigations by the police revealed that the co-offender was the driver.

33     In the instant case, the Accused lied to two different police officers in two different places at two different timings. Even if I accepted that his lie to SSG Tan at the scene was spontaneous and that he did not consider the full ramifications of his words, the same could not be said for the second lie at TPHQ three and a half hours later.

34     By this time, the Accused would have failed a second breath test and would certainly have realised that his “spontaneous” lie at the scene had caused him to be arrested and had landed him serious trouble. I did not accept that the Accused had _“ …. inebriated by the alcohol and wanting to help Cheo, …. on impulse largely repeated what he had told the police officer at the scene”._[^8] He did more than repeat what he told the police officer at the scene. While it may not have been sophisticated, he put some thought into his story to embellish it to make it more believable when he told the IO the _“…. he wanted to test drive Cheo’s Maserati.”[^9]_All this was done despite being supposedly exhausted and inebriated by the alcohol.

35     Hence, I was of the opinion that the indicative starting sentence in this case was on the high end of the one to two week sentencing range ie. two weeks’ imprisonment.

36     As a mitigating factor, I considered his close relationship with Cheo neutral at best. It was exactly because of the relationship with Cheo that caused him to give the false statements. Such relationships are common for offences under s.182 when an offender shields another from prosecution. I put no weight on this. However, I took into account the other mitigating factors highlighted by the Defence. This included the fact that the Accused was a first offender, pleaded guilty at an early stage and his contributions to the poor and needy. I was of the view that a slight reduction from the indicative starting sentence was appropriate in this case.

## VII.   SENTENCE IMPOSED

37     All considered, I imposed the following sentences:

> (a)      **MAC-907830-2019** : 12 days’ imprisonment; and

> (b)      **MAC-907831-2019** : 12 days’ imprisonment.

38     The Accused lied to two different police officers in two different places at two different timings. Although the two offences are distinct, they relate to the same legally protected interest. In addition, if the two sentences of imprisonment were to run consecutively, the global sentence of 24 days’ imprisonment would be overly harsh in light of the offence committed. I accordingly ordered that the two sentences of imprisonment to run concurrently.

39     Therefore, the total sentence imposed was:

**_12 days’ imprisonment_**

40     Being dissatisfied with the sentence I have imposed, the Accused now appeals against it. He is presently on bail pending the outcome of this appeal.
