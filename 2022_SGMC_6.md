### District Judge John Ng:

## Introduction

1       Ng Yong Ngee (Huang Yongyi), male/45 years old (hereinafter referred to as “the Offender”) pleaded guilty to the commission of an offence under Section 323 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”) as stated in the Charge _MCN 900987 of 2021_. He admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) in support of the Charge and was convicted accordingly. The Offender has filed an appeal against the fine imposed of $3,000.

## Charge

2       The Charge in _MCN 900987 of 2021_ reads as follows:

> “You, Ng Yong Ngee (Huang Yongyi) (Male, 45 years old), are charged that you, on 25 September 2020, at or about 8.19 a.m., at the cross- junction between Clementi Road and West Coast Road, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Rachel Victoria Williams, _to wit_, by slapping her once on her head with your right hand, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 323 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.”

## Summary of Facts

3       The offence was committed after an encounter on the road between the Offender and a victim who was riding a bicycle with her young child as pillion. The Offender was the driver of a car with his family inside. The following are the essential facts of this case gleaned from the SOF and the viewing of the video footages of the incident obtained from the Offender’s in-car camera.

4       On 25 September 2020, at or about 8.18 a.m., the Offender was driving his motor car along West Coast Road in the left-most lane. As the Offender was approaching the junction of Clementi Road and West Coast Road at a slow speed due to traffic conditions, the victim came alongside the left of his car, riding her bicycle with her 3-year-old child as pillion in a baby chair (as can be seen in the video footage). At about this point in time, the Offender wanted to get into the slip road to turn into Clementi Road. It can be seen from the video footage that the Offender sped up to get ahead of the bicycle and started turning left into the slip road. In doing so, the Offender’s car almost caused a sideswipe with the victim’s bicycle. The car only managed to move past the bicycle without colliding with it by cutting across the chevron lines before the slip road.

5       After the car had overtaken the bicycle and stopped behind another car before the zebra crossing of the slip road due to stationary traffic ahead, the victim used her hand to hit the car from behind. After hitting the car with her hand, she continued riding straight along West Coast Road, passing the car on its right before stopping on the leftmost lane of West Coast Road to conform to the red stop light at the junction with Clementi Road. After hearing the victim hit his car, the Offender sounded his car horn at the victim a few times.

6       Whilst waiting at the junction for the lights to turn, the victim turned back and gestured at the Offender, before turning to face forward. The Offender got out of his car and approached the victim from behind. At least 15 seconds had elapsed between the sound of the victim hitting the car with her hand and the sound of the Offender opening his car door.

7       At about 8.19 a.m., the Offender can be seen walking up to the victim from behind her and using his right hand to slap the head of the victim once on the right side of the bicycle helmet she had on her head. After hitting the victim, the Offender turned around, walked back to his car and drove off.

8       Later that same day, the victim sought medical attention at the National University Hospital. According to the Medical Report prepared by Dr Tessa Lim, the victim informed that she had experienced ringing in her right ear for a few minutes before it resolved. On arrival in the emergency department, she complained of pain over her right cheek and neck area. Her vital signs were normal and physical examination revealed tenderness over her right cheekbone area. Her neck range of motion was full, with no tenderness on palpation of the cervical spine. She was diagnosed as having a right cheekbone bruise. She declined analgesia and was discharged on the same day.

## Antecedents

9       The Offender did not have any previous convictions.

## Submissions on sentence

### Prosecution’s submissions

10     The Prosecution submitted that this case is not a case of road rage. The DPP suggested a sentence of a fine of between $4,000 and $5,000 and took reference from the sentence imposed for the first charge in the case of _Public Prosecutor v Lim Yee Hua_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1106</span> (“**Lim Yee Hua**”). In that case, Justice Chan Seng Onn affirmed the sentence imposed by the District Judge of a fine of $4,000 on the first charge.

### Mitigation plea

11     The Offender was unrepresented. He submitted a typewritten letter in mitigation. In gist, the Offender pleaded for a low fine in view of his unemployment, his early plea of guilty saving time and resources and the fact that he was a first offender with no prior history of violence. He had felt provoked by the victim’s act of hitting his car and had acted out of character. He also submitted that the injury caused was minor and he had cooperated fully with the investigators.

## Sentence

12     The offence of Voluntarily Causing Hurt under Section 323 of the Penal Code is punishable with up to three years’ imprisonment or with up to a fine of $5,000, or with both. The calibration of the appropriate sentence must take into account the harm caused and the offender’s culpability that is based on the assessment of the circumstances of the case and the relevant sentencing factors.

13     Section 323 of the Penal Code provides that:

> “Whoever, except in the case provided for by section 334, voluntarily causes hurt shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 years, or with fine which may extend to $5,000, or with both.”

### Guidance from a High Court case

14     The case of **Lim Yee Hua** provides us with the relevant considerations in calibrating the appropriate sentence for such a case as this. For the first charge in the case of **Lim Yee Hua**, the incident involved the offender there failing to rein in his anger and assaulted the victim only because the victim had hit the top of the offender’s car. The victim there had hit the car because he was angered by the manner of the offender’s driving and failing to give way to him as a pedestrian at a zebra crossing.

15     The offence-specific factors to be considered are the level of harm and culpability. The level of harm is determined by the injuries suffered and whether a vulnerable part of the body was targeted. The level of culpability requires the court to look at the manner of the assault and the surrounding circumstances. The offender-specific factors to be considered are factors such as the criminal record of the offender, whether he had pleaded guilty or claimed trial and whether he had made restitution.

### The Calibration of the Sentence

16     In passing the sentence, I had taken into account that the Offender had no criminal record and had pleaded guilty. I decided to impose a lower fine than what the Prosecution had submitted because I had found the suggested uplift by the DPP for the offence to be on the high side. The facts of the present case were not as serious as the case of **Lim Yee Hua** and the conviction in that case was after a trial. The injuries suffered in the present case are comparable to that in **Lim Yee Hua**. In both cases, the injuries arising from the incidents were minor.

17     The Offender claimed that the victim’s action of hitting his car had caused alarm and startled him and his family. This is not quite true as it was his honking that startled his child who had asked why “daddy had sounded his horn”. It seemed that it was only the Offender who was perturbed by the victim’s act. Nevertheless, I had taken that into account in calibrating the amount of the fine in recognition that it was the victim who had hit his car in anger over his driving endangering her safety and that of her child.

18     The subsequent actions taken by him of leaving the car stationary on the busy road to commit a stealth assault on the victim from behind her were simply not proportionate and reflected a high level of culpability in the commission of the offence. It was a deliberate act and not one arising from a direct confrontation between two persons in close proximity on the spur of the moment. There was a period of at least 15 seconds from the time the victim hit his car, to the time he opened his car door, and several more seconds from the time he walked from his stationary car to the junction where the victim was with her child.

19     The footage clearly showed that the Offender had approached the victim from behind her surreptitiously before using his hand to hit the right side of the bicycle helmet that she was wearing and causing a cheekbone bruise on her face. The victim was clueless to the impending violence and would not have the chance to defend herself or protect herself from being assaulted. Although the offence committed by the Offender might not have crossed the custodial threshold in sentencing, a significant fine is in order.

## Conclusion

20     The sentence of a fine of $3000 is lower than what the Prosecution had submitted for but it should adequately address the sentencing objectives as presented by the facts and circumstances of this case. The significant fact is that the Offender was highly culpable in carrying out the brazen and cowardly attack from behind the victim. He had left his car in the middle of the busy road to sneakily approach the victim, who was a mother with a child as pillion on a bicycle, from the back and assaulted her with no warning whatsoever.

21     Although this case might not have resulted in a jail term for the Offender, a clear signal that it is wrong of any motorist to resort to injuring another person whilst on the road can still be sent out by a substantial fine.

22     The Offender has paid his fine.
