Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Section 9(1)(e) Remote Gambling Act 2014 (Act 34 of 2014) – Principle of sentencing

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9279/2021/01.\]

6 January 2022

### District Judge Eddy Tham Tong Kong:

## INTRODUCTION

1       This is an appeal against sentence by the Accused. The Accused had pleaded guilty before me to one charge under section 9(1)(e) of the Remote Gambling Act 2014 (Act 34 of 2014) (“the Act”). She also admitted and consented to one other charge under section 8(1) of the Act to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

2       The charge reads

> “that you, between 15 November 2020 and 29 November 2020, in Singapore, did assist in the conduct of remote gambling in accordance with arrangements made by your principal, known to you as “Ah Boy”, to wit, by:

>> a.    Managing the agent account styled as ‘Aag6127’ on the website ‘www.sol68.com’, which is a remote gambling service not provided by an exempt operator or a person otherwise exempt under Section 40 of the Remote Gambling Act 2014 (No. 34 of 2014) (“RGA”), and accepting and placing 4D bets amounting to S$12,010.40 on behalf of at least 15 punters on player accounts created using the aforesaid agent account; and

>> b.    Settling bet monies with the various punters,

>> and as a result you facilitated one or more individuals to commit an offence under Section 8 of the RGA, with a total bet value of S$12,010.40 , and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 9(1)(e) of the RGA.

3       I sentenced the Accused to a fine of $20,000 and imprisonment of 8 weeks.

4       The Accused, being dissatisfied with the sentence has filed a notice of appeal against sentence. She has paid the fine. I granted a stay on the sentence of imprisonment and the Accused is presently on bail pending this appeal.

5       I now set out the grounds of my decision.

## THE STATEMENT OF FACTS

6       The Accused admitted without qualification to the Statement of Facts tendered by the Prosecution.

7       I set out briefly the facts contained therein.

### Background details

8       The Accused is Khoo Moy Seen, a 38-year-old female Malaysian, (D.O.B.: 16/10/1982).

9       2. The co-accused persons are:

> a.     Ong Siong Lin (“Ong”), a 52-year-old male Chinese Singaporean. Ong and the Accused were in a relationship at the material time.

> b.     Lim Kok Keong (“Lim”), a 46-year-old male Chinese Singaporean. Lim and the Accused were colleagues at the material time.

### The Accused’s arrest

10     On 2 December 2020, at about 1.35pm, acting on information received, the Accused was detained by a party of police officers at the open-air carpark beside Blk 178 Toa Payoh Central for offences under the Remote Gambling Act. The following item was seized in her possession:

> a.     One iPhone 11 Pro Max.

11     The Accused provided the officers with the log-in details to the agent account styled as ‘Aag6127’, on the website: www.sol68.com. The officers accessed the aforesaid agent account and retrieved the betting records stored on the account.

### Background information of the offence

12     Investigations revealed that sometime towards the end of 2019, the Accused became acquainted with a man known to her as “Ah Boy”. They had met at the “Yun Lai Eating House” coffeeshop located at 33 Geylang Lorong 15 (“the coffeeshop”), which the Accused frequented.

13     At the time, “Ah Boy” asked the Accused whether she was interested in participating in illegal 4D remote gambling activities. He informed the Accused that she stood to gain a 9% rebate on the total amount of bets collected and a further 5% commission should any of her punters win a prize. The Accused agreed. “Ah Boy” then handed over the log-in details to the agent account styled as ‘Aag6127’, password: ‘\[redacted\]’, on the website: www.sol68.com (“the agent account”). The credit limit for the agent account was set at S$40,000.

### Facts pertaining to the 1st Charge (MAC-901657-2021)

14     The Accused acted as an agent for about 1 year and had at least 15 punters under her. As directed by “Ah Boy”, the Accused would charge her punters an illegal rate of S$1.60 for a “big ticket” and S$0.70 for a “small ticket”. The official rate charged by Singapore Pools is S$2 for a “big ticket” and S$1 for a “small ticket”.

15     The Accused’s punters would either call or tell her in person to place bets on their behalf.

16     Thereafter, the Accused would log-on to the agent account provided by “Ah Boy” and assist her punters to place bets in individual player accounts that she created for them. The accused would settle monies with her punters when she met them in person on an ad-hoc basis.

17     Both Ong and Lim were the accused’s punters.

18     Sometime in January 2020, the Accused approached Ong to inquire whether he wanted to place any 4D bets through her. Ong agreed. Subsequently, when the Accused visited the coffeeshop, which was owned by Ong, she would ask him whether he wanted to place any 4D bets. The Accused would assist Ong to place bets in the player account labelled as “KK”.

19     Sometime in August 2020, Lim discovered through a conversation with the Accused that she had the means to place illegal 4D bets. Lim then began placing 4D bets through the Accused. The Accused would assist Ong to place bets in the player account labelled as “Keong”.

20     The Accused would settle monies with “Ah Boy” at the coffeeshop on an ad-hoc basis, usually either weekly or fortnightly.

21     Between 15 November 2020 and 29 November 2020, the Accused did assist in the conduct of remote gambling in accordance with arrangements made by her principal, “Ah Boy”, by:

> a.     Managing the agent account styled as ‘Aag6127’ on the website ‘www.sol68.com’, and accepting and placing 4D bets amounting to S$12,010.40 on behalf of at least 15 punters on the aforementioned account; and

> b.     Settling bet monies with the various punters on an ad-hoc basis.

22     The website ‘www.sol68.com’ is not an exempt operator or person otherwise exempt under Section 40 of the Act. Hence, it is an unlawful remote gambling service under the Act.

23     By virtue of the foregoing, the Accused has thus facilitated one or more individuals to commit an offence under section 8(1) of the Act and has thereby committed an offence punishable under section 9(1)(e) of the Act.

24     The co-accused persons have been dealt with separately.

## ANTECEDENTS

25     The Accused does not have any previous convictions.

## PROSECUTION’S SUBMISSION ON SENTENCE

26     The Prosecution relied on the sentencing framework as adapted in the case of _Public Prosecutor v. Loy Jit Chan_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGMC 9</span> (“_Loy Jit Chan_”) based on the sentencing approach in the High Court decision of _Koo Kah Yee v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 3 SLR 1440</span> (“_Koo Kah Yee_”) on sentencing of offences under the Act.

27     The Prosecution applied the 5-step approach in _Koo Kah Yee_, namely:

> i.     Identify (a) the level of harm and (b) the offender’s culpability, based on the relevant offence-specific factors.

> ii.     Identify the indicative sentencing range.

> iii.     Identify the appropriate starting point within the indicative sentencing range.

> iv.     Make adjustments for offender-specific factors such as the lack of antecedents and pleading guilty at an early stage; and finally

> v.     Take a step back and have regard to the totality principle.

28     In their submissions, Prosecution also adopted the table of sentencing ranges as set out in _Loy Jit Chan_ for an offence under section 9(1) of the Act:

![]([2022] SGMC 0001_Image/[2022] SGMC 0001_image1.png)

29     Applying the specific facts of the present case, Prosecution submitted that for the first step, in terms of harm, the value of bets involved which is $12,010.40, should be in the middle range of slight harm after comparing with the classification of lower end of moderate harm in _Loy Jit Chan_ which involved bet amounts of $23,000-$25,000.

30     As for culpability, the Prosecution submitted that the Accused should be classified as having low to middle range of medium culpability, considering that the Accused played a significant role as an agent as she had acted as one for an extended period of one year, managed one agent account by accepting and placing bets on behalf of at least 15 punters; and met with her principal, “Ah Boy” either weekly or fortnightly to settle the bet monies. She also committed the offence for personal gain: she gained a 9% rebate on all the bets placed through her and an additional 5% if any of her punters won a prize.

31     The Prosecution thus submitted that the indicative sentencing range would be up to 9 months’ imprisonment.

32     For the third step, the Prosecutions submitted that the relevant aggravating factor was one similar charge under section 8(1) of the Act taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing and the mitigating factor was the Accused’s early plea of guilt. The Prosecution then submitted that an appropriate sentence would be 2-3 months’ imprisonment.

33     The Prosecution submitted that this proposed sentence is in line with the sentence meted out in _Loy Jit Chan_, where the culpability of the offender was lower but the bets involved were of higher amount and a sentence of 3 months was meted out.

34     Finally, as the Accused had gained commission from the bets placed through her, the Prosecution submitted that a fine of the specified minimum of $20,000 is justified to achieve the twin aims of disgorging the profits from the unlawful enterprise and of punishing the Accused- _Koo Kah Yee_ at \[39\]-\[40\]) and there was nothing exceptional to warrant a departure from this principle.

## MITIGATION

35     In mitigation, the Defence Counsel highlighted that the Accused was remorseful and had pleaded guilty. She also has a clean record.

36     It was asserted that the Accused had committed the offence without realising she had been used by ‘Ah Boy’ and or the syndicate as an agent.

37     The Defence Counsel also claimed that she had only helped with the purchase for her friend and colleague and the amounts involved are really small.

38     Hence the Defence Counsel submitted that the minimum fine of $20,000 without any custodial sentence, would be adequate punishment.

## THE COURT’S DECISION ON SENTENCE

### The sentencing principle and framework

39     The offence under section 9(1)(e) of the Act is punishable with a minimum fine of $20,000 or with imprisonment up to 5 years or both.

40     The sentencing principle for offences under the Act would be clearly one of deterrence, both specific and general. The reasons to deter this kind of remote gambling had been amply enunciated in _Koo Kah Yee_ at \[30\]:

> i.     illegal remote gambling operators are typically associated with other criminal activities and syndicated crime, which may also operate on a transnational scale;

> ii.     the nature and design of certain games that are offered remotely lend themselves to repetitive play and addictive behaviour; and

> iii.     remote gambling is ubiquitous and easily accessible, due to the growing reach of the Internet and widespread use of mobile devices.

41     In _Koo Kah Yee_, whilst it is noted that there is a discretion to impose fines only, the High Court had held that such a situation would only be reserved for a situation where “both the level of harm occasioned by an offence is slight and the culpability is low” – see \[36\].

42     I agree with the approach taken by the District Court in _Loy Jit Chan_ to calibrate the sentencing table in _Koo Kah Yee_ meant for section 11 offences to sentencing a section 9 offence under the Act. In _Koo Kah Yee_, the High Court had highlighted without disapproval the observation made by the District Judge in _Public Prosecutor v Elger Kua Meng Tern_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGMC 5</span> (“_Elger Kua_”) that the sentencing precedents under section 9 would be relevant to section 11 offences, As noted by the District Judge in _Elger Kua_, the difference would be the maximum sentences stipulated which suggested that facilitating online gambling as a principal under s 11(1) would generally be regarded more seriously than would be the case where an agent facilitated one or more of the aspects of running an online game on behalf of a principal under s 9(1) of the Act. I found that the sentencing table set out in _Loy Jit Chan_ has been proportionately calibrated downwards from that set out in _Koo Kah Yee_, taking into account that the maximum sentence of imprisonment is 5 years under section 9 instead of 7 years under section 11(1). I have therefore adopted it. The table is as set out at \[28\] above.

### Application of the Sentencing Framework

43     Applying offence specific-factors, I agree with Prosecution that the harm caused by the Accused as reflected in the amount of bets of around $12,000 to be in the middle of the low band. Whilst the amount of bets was lower compared to the bets involved in _Loy Jit Chan_ where the smallest amount in the charges was in the range of $23,000, it was not insignificant. The Defence counsel had indicated that the bet amounts were small but clearly the aggregate amount of about $12,000 is not a paltry sum.

44     As for culpability, the Accused would fall into the medium category. Although she only managed one agent account, she had 15 punters under her and she had operated this service for a significant period of one year. She was not just a passive agent but she had at least in one instance initiated getting someone to place illegal bets through her, by approaching Ong as set out at \[18\] above. She would also create individual player accounts for each of her punters.

45     Her role was also significant as she not only placed bets on behalf of the punters but she had also collected the monies and would have to meet her principal, ‘Ah Boy’, regularly to settle the payments. She was effectively a runner for ‘Ah Boy’. She was providing this service as a result of being enticed by the commissions that come with the bets placed through her. Based on 9% commission, without including bonus on any wins from her punters, she would have earned about $1000.

46     The indicative sentencing range would be imprisonment of up to 9 months. Given that she had pleaded guilty and was only playing the role of a runner and did not play any significant role in a syndicate, I would peg her sentence at the lower end of the spectrum in this case. I also took into account that she has a clean record and has pleaded guilty at an early stage.

47     Accordingly, I sentenced the Accused to 8 weeks’ imprisonment.

48     As for the fines, given that she had committed the offence out of personal gain and has received commissions from the bets placed through her, it is only appropriate that fines should be imposed as well. Accordingly, I have also imposed the minimum fine of $20,000.

## CONCLUSION

49     Although the Accused might have started off betting remotely as a punter, it unfortunately did not remain as a mere pastime for her. She had progressed on to be an agent for ‘Ah Boy’ to facilitate the placing and collection of bets for others and she did so for an extended period of one year. As such, mere fines would not be a sufficient deterrent and accordingly a relatively short custodial sentence has been imposed.
