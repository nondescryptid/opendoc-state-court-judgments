Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Customs Act Section 128D

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9134/2022/01.\]

28 July 2022

### District Judge John Ng:

## Introduction

1       Tan Teck Leong, Melvin (Chen Deliang, Melvin), male/43 years old (hereinafter referred to as “the Accused”) pleaded guilty to the commission of three offences under Section 128D Customs Act (Chapter 70, Rev Ed 2004) (“the Act”) for fraudulently evading Goods and Services Tax (“GST”). He admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) for the three charges and was convicted accordingly. The Accused also admitted to the commission of six other similar offences under the Act and consented to have them taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing on the three convicted charges. For each of the convicted charge, the Accused was sentenced to a fine of $1,000,000 (one million dollars). The total fine imposed was $3,000,000 (three million dollars).

2       The Prosecution is dissatisfied with the sentences passed and has filed this appeal against sentence.

## Charges

3       The three convicted charges are similarly worded. It suffices to state the Charge in _DAC 911649 of 2021_ which reads as follows:

> “You, Tan Teck Leong, Melvin (Chen Deliang, Melvin), male / 42 years old, are charged that you, between sometime around 4 January 2016 and 30 December 2016, in Singapore, being the sole proprietor of TL Freight (“TL”), did embark on a course of conduct to fraudulently evade Goods and Services Tax (GST) relating to miscellaneous goods imported by TL into Singapore from China vide 135 Cargo Clearance Permits, to wit, you provided packing lists which contained untrue value of the miscellaneous goods to Intertrans Network (S) Pte. Ltd., Jazce International and V-Global Services for the purposes of making declarations of the 135 Cargo Clearance Permits, resulting in the fraudulent evasion of GST amounting to $182,796.46, and you have thereby, by virtue of Sections 26 and 77 of the Goods and Services Tax Act (Cap. 117A), paragraph 3 of the Goods and Services Tax (Application of Legislation Relating to Customs and Excise Duties) Order (Cap. 117A, Order 4) and paragraph 2 of the Goods and Services Tax (Application of Customs Act) (Provisions on Trials, Proceedings, Offences and Penalties) Order (Cap. 117A, Order 5), committed an offence under Section 128D of the Customs Act (Cap. 70), punishable under Section 128L(2) of the same Act, which is an amalgamated charge pursuant to Section 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68).”

## Summary of Facts

4       The Accused is the sole proprietor of TL Freight (UEN No. 53110196K) (“TL”). TL is a freight forwarder which ships consolidated cargoes for Singapore importers from China to Singapore. As the sole proprietor of TL, the Accused would make all business decisions and was the one who would create a consolidated packing list for each shipment. The Singapore importers or their suppliers would send the Accused a copy of the individual packing lists and invoices (“Supplier’s Invoice”) after which the Accused would collate the packing lists into a consolidated packing list (“Consolidated Packing List”).

### Facts for DAC 911649 of 2021

5       Investigations revealed that between 4 January 2016 and 30 December 2016, for the shipment of miscellaneous goods imported into Singapore from China by TL vide 135 CCPs, the Accused had falsified a set of Consolidated Packing List (the “2016 set”) stating a fictitious value instead of the actual value of $4,285,498.88. When importing goods into Singapore, a declaration must be made to Customs and the GST payable on the imported goods must be paid to Customs. When preparing the Consolidated Packing List, the Accused was also required to indicate the average unit price for each category of goods. Investigations revealed that when determining the average unit price, the Accused would deliberately lower the value of the goods at random. There was no specific quantum or percentage in which the unit prices were lowered. The Accused provided its declaring agents – Intertrans Network (S) Pte. Ltd. (‘Intertrans’), Jazce International (‘Jazce’) or V-Global Services (‘V-Global’) – with the falsified Consolidated Packing List for TL’s shipments from China for the purpose of making such declarations. The Accused had furnished the falsified 2016 set of Consolidated Packing List to Intertrans, Jazce and V-Global for the purpose of making a declaration to Customs for the importation of the said goods.

6       As instructed by the Accused and in reliance on the value stated in the falsified 2016 set of Consolidated Packing List, Intertrans, Jazce and V-Global declared to Customs that the value of the imported goods is $1,674,120.87. The GST payable based on the declared value amounting to $117,188.47 was paid to Customs. The Accused was aware that by declaring a lower value to Customs, he would pay less GST for the imported goods. Based on the actual value of $4,285,498.88, the GST payable is $299,984.93. Therefore, the difference between the actual GST payable and the GST paid is $182,796.46.

7       The Accused had prepaid Intertrans, Jazce and V-Global the GST amount reflected in the falsified 2016 set of Consolidated Packing List. Upon receipt of the goods by the buyers in Singapore, the Accused would send these buyers a separate invoice for sea freight charges and GST reimbursement. The Accused would use the actual value reflected in the Supplier’s Invoice and not the falsified Consolidated Packing List when billing the buyers for the GST reimbursement. The buyers would reimburse the Accused the GST (i.e. $299,984.93) based on the actual value reflected in the Supplier’s Invoice and the Accused pocketed the difference (i.e. $182,796.46). By the foregoing, the Accused had fraudulently evaded GST amounting to $182,796.46.

### Facts for DAC 911650 of 2021

8       Investigations revealed that between 8 January 2017 and 27 December 2017, for the shipment of miscellaneous goods imported into Singapore from China by TL vide 126 CCPs, the Accused had falsified another set of Consolidated Packing List (the “2017 set”) stating a fictitious value instead of the actual value of $4,599,353.92. The Accused furnished the falsified 2017 set of Consolidated Packing List to V-Global for the purpose of making a declaration to Customs for the importation of the said goods.

9       As instructed by the Accused and in reliance on the value stated in the falsified 2017 set of Consolidated Packing List, V-Global declared to Customs that the value of the imported goods is $1,458,148.22. The GST payable based on the declared value amounting to $102,070.41 was paid to Customs. The Accused was aware that by declaring a lower value to Customs, he would pay less GST for the imported goods.

10     Based on the actual value of $4,599,353.92, the GST payable is $321,954.81. Therefore, the difference between the actual GST payable and the GST paid is $219,884.40. The Accused had prepaid V-Global the GST amount reflected in the falsified 2017 set of Consolidated Packing List. Upon receipt of the goods by the buyers in Singapore, the Accused sent these buyers a separate invoice for sea freight charges and GST reimbursement. The Accused used the actual value reflected in the Supplier’s Invoice and not in the falsified 2017 set of Consolidated Packing List when billing the buyers for the GST reimbursement. The buyers reimbursed the Accused the GST (i.e. $321,954.81) based on the actual value reflected in the Supplier’s Invoice and the Accused pocketed the difference (i.e. $219,884.40). By the foregoing, the Accused had fraudulently evaded GST amounting to $219,884.40.

### Facts for DAC 911652 of 2021

11     Investigations revealed that between 2 January 2019 and 31 December 2019, for the shipment of miscellaneous goods imported into Singapore from China by TL vide 100 CCPs, the Accused had again falsified another set of Consolidated Packing List (the “2019 set”) stating a fictitious value instead of the actual value of $4,030,214.08. The Accused had furnished the falsified 2019 set of Consolidated Packing List to V-Global for the purpose of making a declaration to Customs for the importation of the said goods.

12     As instructed by the Accused and in reliance of the value stated in the falsified 2019 set of Consolidated Packing List, V-Global declared to Customs that the value of the imported goods is $1,150,979.20. The GST payable based on the declared value amounting to $80,568.79 was paid to Customs.

13     The Accused was aware that by declaring a lower value to Customs, he would pay less GST for the imported goods. Based on the actual value of $4,030,214.08, the GST payable is $282,115.00. Therefore, the difference between the actual GST payable and the GST paid is $201,546.21.

14     The Accused had prepaid V-Global the GST amount reflected in the falsified 2019 set of Consolidated Packing List. Upon receipt of the goods by the buyers in Singapore, the Accused would send these buyers a separate invoice for sea freight charges and GST reimbursement.

15     The Accused had used the actual value reflected in the Supplier’s Invoice and not in the falsified 2019 set of Consolidated Packing List when billing the buyers for the GST reimbursement. The buyers reimbursed the Accused the GST (i.e. $282,115.00) based on the actual value reflected in the Supplier’s Invoice and the Accused pocketed the difference (i.e. $201,546.21). By the foregoing, the Accused had fraudulently evaded GST amounting to $201,546.21.

16     Investigations further revealed that the Accused committed the offences for personal gain as he was deep in debt from various loans he had taken from various banks and family members, both in Singapore and in China.

## Antecedents

17     The Offender did not have any criminal record.

## Submissions on sentence

### Prosecution’s submissions

18     The Prosecution submitted that the sentencing norm is a fine of ten times the tax evaded. The Prosecution suggested a global fine of about five and a half million dollars, based on the fact that there was only restitution of fifty thousand dollars which reduced the tax evaded to about five hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

19     The Prosecution took reference from the sentences imposed in the cases of _PP v Ang Wee Tat Vida_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 163</span> (_“Vida_”) and _PP v Tay Kien Chuan_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGDC 280</span> (“_Tay Kien Chuan_”).

20     The Prosecution highlighted, _inter alia_, the following considerations:

> (a)     The period of offending was long: between 2016 to 2020. Between 2016 and 2020, the accused had fraudulently evaded GST on a significant number of shipments of earphone boxes and mobile phone shells imported into Singapore i.e. by falsely suppressing the values of these imported goods in a total of 502 declared permits.

> (b)     As the sole proprietor of TL, the Accused had full control over the operations of the business and played a pivotal role in the fraudulent suppression of values in the consolidated packing lists and consolidated invoices of their respective sea and air shipments. These documents were then handed over to the declaring agents for permit declaration and the Accused would then pocket the difference between the actual GST received from his customers and the suppressed GST which was paid to the declaring agents.

> (c)     Fines under s 128L(2) of the Act are intended by Parliament to have a retributive and deterrent effect. The fines imposed should be fixed at a level which is sufficiently high to achieve both general and specific deterrence, and retribution, in the sense of reflecting society’s abhorrence of the offence under the Act.

> (d)     Most of the total amount of GST evaded remains unrecovered to-date. The Accused only made restitution of $50,000 which is about 6% of the total amount evaded.

21     As for the rate of default sentences, the case of _PP v Ho Chee Wai_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 174</span> was cited by the Prosecution in proposing broad markers for the conversion of fines to in-default imprisonment terms, taking into consideration the statutory maximum of 6 years’ default imprisonment per charge. This approach ensures that the Court has regard to the full range of default sentences prescribed by Parliament, and its obligation to determine precisely where the offender’s conduct falls within such range. The Prosecution sought a default sentence of 52 to 54 months of imprisonment.

22     Section 319(1)(b)(v) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 mandates that in cases where a fine is imposed on more than one charge, the default imprisonment terms for each charge must run consecutively.

23     The Prosecution had also confirmed that the Accused had provided assistance to Customs in relation to activities involving duty unpaid cigarettes and the veracity of Paragraphs 44 and 45 of the Mitigation Plea submitted by the Defence dated 19 May 2022 was not disputed.

### Mitigation Plea

24     Counsel for the Accused submitted in mitigation, _inter alia_, the following factors:

> (a)     Early plea of guilty to the offences. This showed remorse and as stated by Justice V K Rajah in _Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 653</span> at \[56\] and \[77\], remorse can be considered by the court in mitigation as it facilitates the administration of justice.

> (b)     The Accused had also demonstrated genuine remorse by fully cooperating with the Singapore Customs. Throughout 2020 and early 2021, the Accused co-operated with the Singapore Customs fully during their investigations, periodically going down to the main office of Singapore Customs to assist at the request of Investigating Officer Lam Yi Xin.

> (c)     The Accused is a first offender and has no criminal antecedents whatsoever.

> (d)     There was a partial restitution of $50,000.

> (e)     The Accused had been assisting the Singapore Customs in keeping an eye out for potential smugglers of contraband cigarettes in the sea freight industry. In this regard, various officers from the Singapore Customs would update the Accused as to the latest modus operandi of smugglers, for which the Accused will keep a lookout. When the Accused spotted any activity that is similar to what had been described to him, he informed the relevant officers accordingly. As a direct result of the tip-offs, the Singapore Customs had managed to apprehend several smugglers.

> (f)     The Accused acted alone and employed a simple and unsophisticated method in evading GST. A check of the goods against the packing list that under-declared the GST payable would have easily alerted the authorities to the discrepancy.

## Sentence

25     The offences committed by the Accused are punishable with fines only. The offence under Section 128D of the Act is a specified offence and is punishable under Section 128L(2) which provides that:

> “(2)  Subject to subsection (3), any person who is guilty of a specified offence shall be liable on conviction to a fine of —

>> (a)    not less than 10 times the amount of the customs duty, excise duty or tax the payment of which would have been evaded by the commission of the offence or $5,000, whichever is the lesser amount, subject to a minimum of $1,000 where the specified offence involves goods consisting wholly or partly of relevant tobacco products; and

>> (b)    not more than 20 times the amount of the customs duty, excise duty or tax the payment of which would have been so evaded or $5,000, whichever is the greater amount,

> except that where the amount of customs duty or excise duty cannot be ascertained, the penalty may amount to a fine not exceeding $5,000, subject to a minimum of $1,000 where the specified offence involves goods consisting wholly or partly of relevant tobacco products.”

### High Court Guidance

26     The case _Yap Ah Lai v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 3 SLR 180</span> (“_Yap Ah Lai_”) provides us with the over-arching considerations in calibrating the appropriate sentence for the importation of uncustomed goods. Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon (“CJ Menon”) emphasised at \[23\] the two public policy rationales of the offence of importation of uncustomed goods as follows:

> “The offence of importation of uncustomed goods is directed at two evils: the first is the loss of revenue to the Government, and the second is the offence against the public policy and interest in reducing the consumption of harmful goods by raising their cost to the user.”

27     In the case of _Yap Ah Lai_ before CJ Menon, the second evil was the stronger interest at play (see \[25\] of the judgment) while for the present case before me, only the first evil is at play. This significant difference is due to the fact that the type of offences in cases such as _Yap Ah Lai_ had to do with the smuggling of harmful goods such as tobacco and liquors. On the other hand, the mischief in the present case is the fraudulent evasion of GST relating to miscellaneous goods. The Accused’s freight businesses imported goods such as clothes, furniture, food, phone accessories and stationery. The Accused had under-declared the actual value of the imported items resulting in the under-payment of GST. There was no smuggling into Singapore of prohibited or harmful goods.

### The Calibration of the Sentence

28     I calibrated the sentence based on the following considerations:

> (a)     The amounts of GST evaded by the fraudulent conduct of the Accused. In the round, the average amount of evaded GST per charge was in the region of $200,000.

> (b)     The period of offending was between 2016 and 2020. I agreed with the Prosecution that this was a long period of offending. However, I was also mindful to avoid double-counting of this factor with the value of evaded GST involved in the offences. The amounts in the offences came up to a large sum as they were accumulations of smaller sums involved over a long period of time. In a case like this, there is an overlapping effect of two interlinked sentencing factors.

> (c)     Being the sole proprietor of TL, the Accused had pocketed the evaded GST and was the only one profiting from the offences.

> (d)     The Accused was a first offender and had pleaded guilty. There was partial restitution of $50,000. The restitution, as submitted by the Prosecution, might not be substantial. However, it was still significant when seen in the light of the annual income of the Accused. This was a factor considered relevant by the High Court in _Chia Kah Boon_.

> (e)     The scheme was not sophisticated and the Accused was not part of a syndicate. The Accused had acted alone and the method of deception for the under-declaration of the value of the imported goods was simple.

> (f)     I had not given weight to the assistance given to Customs by the Accused in their enforcement efforts against contraband cigarettes as it is not a relevant sentencing factor in this case.

29     The total sentence imposed amounting to $3,000,000 is lower than what the Prosecution had submitted for but it should adequately address the sentencing objectives as presented by the facts and circumstances of this case. I could find no justifiable and rational basis for the suggestion by the Prosecution that a multiplier of ten times is the norm. The precedent cases for importation of uncustomed goods (which are not tobacco products or liquors) ranged from two times as in the case of _PP v Wong Yoon Hing Francis_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 155</span> (“_Wong Yoon Hing_”) to ten times as in the case of _PP v Ang Wee Tat Vida_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 163</span> (“_Vida_”). There were also cases in which the fines were of around five times as in the case of _Chia Kah Boon v PP_ \[1999\] 4 SLR 72 (“_Chia Kah Boon_”) to six times as in the unreported case of _PP v Ho Shyan Tien_ (DAC 906840 of 2020). Borrowing from what was said by CJ Menon in _Yap Ah Lai_ (at \[60\] and \[61\]) on the sentencing practice given as a reason by the sentencing judge there, the same observations can be made here of the Prosecution’s submissions that the multiplier of ten times was the norm. First, there was no evident and settled sentencing norm in the State Courts in relation to sentences imposed for the offences committed in the present case not involving prohibited or harmful goods. Second, there was no consistency in the quantum of fines imposed for such offences, in which the gravamen of the offences was solely the evasion of GST.

30     On the question of what the appropriate sentence should be, in the case of _Chia Kah Boon_ at \[15\], in determining the fines to be imposed on the appellant, CJ Yong Pung How took into account two competing considerations. He said,

> “… On one hand, the fines had to be of an amount which the appellant could reasonably pay given his financial means. On the other hand, the fines had to be fixed at a level which would be sufficiently high to achieve the dual objectives of deterrence, in terms of deterring both the appellant and other importers from evading GST on imported goods in future, and retribution, in the sense of reflecting society’s abhorrence of the offence under s 130(1)(a) of the Customs Act. In particular, importers and other persons who might be tempted to commit the same offence should not be given the impression that they may be let off lightly for their misdeeds if they are detected simply because they lack the financial ability to pay the fines which may be imposed under s 130(1)(i) of the Act.”

Bearing these considerations in mind, CJ Yong concluded that:

> “a fine of five times the amount of GST payable in respect of each charge would be just and appropriate in light of the appellant’s limited financial means, the totality principle of sentencing, the aggravated nature of the offences in question, and the deterrent and retributive aspects of the penalty under s 130(1)(i) of the Customs Act”

In the same manner, those were the considerations I had taken into account in deciding that the multiplier should be five times in the case before me.

31     The evaded GST amount for each of the three charges proceeded with was in the region of two hundred thousand per charge and the sentences passed in this case for the three convicted charges were one million dollars per charge. For an offender to be punished with five times the amount of GST defrauded and which resulted in a total of three million dollars in fines should be more than sufficient to serve as retribution and a specific deterrence for the Accused and as a general deterrence for would-be offenders.

32     The total sentence is also not out of line with the precedent cases. The present case is more serious than the case of _Wong Yoon Hing_ and less serious than _Vida_. The Court in _Vida_ described the method used in the commission of the offences as sophisticated and systematic. The High Court dismissed the appeal of the offender in the case of _Vida_. The severity in the present case is quite close to that in _Ho Shyan Tien_ but less serious. The total evaded GST amount for _Ho Shyan Tien_ was $1,252,100.18, which is a higher sum of about 1.5 times the total amount of $810,507.78 in the present case. The multiplier used by the Court in passing the sentence in _Ho Shyan Tien_ was six times the evaded GST amount. It is noteworthy that the Prosecution in _Ho Shyan Tien_ highlighted to the Court that the usual sentencing tariffs imposed by the Court involving the fraudulent evasion of GST was a multiplier of 7 to 8 times the evaded GST. (This is quite different from the suggestion that 10 times is the norm by the Prosecution in the present case.) The Prosecution there then submitted that a multiplier of 6.5 times would suffice in the circumstances of that case. The judge decided to use a multiplier of 6 times.

33     As for the default sentences, the Prosecution submitted for a period of 52 to 54 months of imprisonment in default of payment of more than $5.5 million which works out to about one-week imprisonment for every $25,000 of fines imposed. The rate in _Tay Kien Chuan_ and _Ho Shyan Tien_ worked out to be about one-week imprisonment for every $30,000 of fines. In the present case, the rate of default sentence was about one-week imprisonment for every $28,800 of fines.

## Conclusion

34     The total sentence of fines amounting to $3,000,000 is lower than what the Prosecution had submitted for but it should adequately address the dominant sentencing principles of deterrence and retribution in this case. The sentences passed cannot be arbitrarily pegged to the multiplier without regard to the multiplicand (referring to the evaded GST).

35     The multiplicand is a significant determinant of the individual and total fines to be arrived at. If the multiplicand is low, the effect of the multiplier cannot be low and must be high to achieve the deterrent effect (see the case of _Moey Keng Kong v PP_ \[2001\] 4 SLR 211). If the multiplicand is high (for example, if the evaded tax is more than $100,000), the multiplier cannot be too high, so as to avoid a crushing outcome of the fines to be paid, as in the case of _Chia Kah Boon_.

36     It is incumbent upon the sentencing court to be mindful of the effect of the monetary fines being imposed and not blindly calibrate based on a mathematical ratio with no correlational basis and no regard to the consequential (and sometimes crushing) outcome of the sentence.

37     Fines need not be astronomical to have the intended and desired deterrent and retributive effects. There must be a sense of proportion in the actual size of the fine to be imposed by reference to the amount of the illegal gain. If the gain was $100,000 and the multiplier used was ten times, the fine imposed would be $1,000,000. In my mind, to impose one million dollars would be manifestly excessive when the gain was $100,000. This view of mine is to be read in the context whereby there is no option of a custodial sentence. There is an obvious need to punish for a crime committed but to lose our sense of proportion by over-punishing would not be just.

38     The Accused was unable to pay the fines and has started serving the total default sentence of 24 months of imprisonment from 30 June 2022 in default of the payment of the total fines of $3,000,000.
