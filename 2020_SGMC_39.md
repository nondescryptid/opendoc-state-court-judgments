### District Judge Vince Gui:

## Introduction

1       This action arose from a motor accident between the Plaintiff’s and the Defendant’s vehicles at a cross junction located underneath the Braddell flyover. It is a huge and busy cross junction with multiple lanes intersecting in different directions. This is a Google Maps extract of the junction:

![]([2020] SGMC 0039_Image/[2020] SGMC 0039_image1.png)

2       The accident involved rather unusual facts. Typically accidents at cross junctions happen when one party infringes on the other party’s right of way by failing to observe traffic signals. In the present case, the accident happened when both parties were, in their view, dutifully observing the traffic signals ahead of them. Both drove straight ahead on their respective lanes upon noticing the traffic light in front of them turning green. Their vehicles nevertheless collided at the cross junction. Following the collision, the Plaintiff commenced this action against the Defendant who was a Grab driver. Parties agreed to determine liability for the accident first, with the quantum of damages to be assessed at a later juncture.

## Background facts

3       The collision took place on 20 June 2018.[^1] The following facts leading up to the collision are undisputed. Before the collision, the Plaintiff was driving his car along Braddell Road towards a slip road leading up to the Central Expressway (“CTE”) (towards city).[^2] Upon reaching the mouth of Braddell Road, he stopped behind the traffic signal that had turned red against him.[^3] His vehicle was the first before the junction.[^4] At around the same time, the Defendant’s vehicle was exiting from CTE through a slip road (from city) towards Braddell Road. His journey was however impeded by heavy traffic along the lane leading into Braddell Road.[^5] Just as he realised the lane ahead has been filled to the brim, he stopped his vehicle right before a yellow box demarcated within the cross junction.[^6] The traffic build-up can be seen from the following screenshot of the video footage taken using the Defendant’s in-car camera:

![]([2020] SGMC 0039_Image/[2020] SGMC 0039_image2.png)

4       The situation is perhaps best depicted by reference to the following diagram of the cross junction. The locations at which the Plaintiff’s and the Defendant’s vehicles stopped are marked in red and blue crosses respectively. The paths of travel subsequently taken by the Plaintiff and the Defendant are marked in red and blue arrows respectively.

![]([2020] SGMC 0039_Image/[2020] SGMC 0039_image3.png)

5       To provide another perspective of the cross junction, below is a Google Maps photograph of the mouth of the slip road from which the Defendant’s vehicle exited.[^7] Right before the collision, the Defendant’s vehicle stopped near where the yellow coloured taxi is located. The Plaintiff’s vehicle stopped at around the location where the white coloured lorry is located.

![]([2020] SGMC 0039_Image/[2020] SGMC 0039_image4.png)

6       A closer look of the location where the Defendant’s vehicle sat stationary can be obtained from the Google Maps photograph below.[^8] The Defendant stopped his vehicle just before the yellow box demarcated in the cross junction, underneath the flyover, as shown in the blue cross marked in the photograph.

![]([2020] SGMC 0039_Image/[2020] SGMC 0039_image5.png)

7       It is also undisputed that both traffic signals ahead of the Plaintiff and the Defendant were red at the time when their vehicles were stationary, and both these signals turned green at or around the same time. Responding to the traffic signals ahead of them, the Plaintiff and the Defendant both proceeded to drive ahead. The Plaintiff accelerated his vehicle across the junction towards the CTE slip road (towards city). The Defendant, while waiting for the vehicles ahead of the yellow box to move off, did not accelerate immediately. He inched forward for a few seconds before accelerating across the junction towards the direction of Upper Serangoon Road. Needless to say, their respective pathways brought them on a collision course. Moments after the Defendant’s vehicle accelerated ahead, a collision ensued within the yellow box demarcated in the cross junction underneath the flyover. With the Plaintiff vehicle dashing across the path of the Defendant’s vehicle, the Defendant’s vehicle collided into the right rear passenger door of the Plaintiff’s vehicle.

8       The unusual factual matrix leaves one wondering: how is it possible that the traffic signals in both intersecting lanes turned green at the same time? The Defendant engaged a third party, ATS Traffic Pte Ltd, to conduct a study on the traffic light sequence at the cross junction. Their study revealed that the traffic signal located along the road leading into Braddell Road was actually meant for vehicles that have already cleared the yellow box.[^9] Vehicular traffic before the cross junction should be governed by the traffic signal located at the mouth of the CTE slip road (from city), as can be seen in Image 4 above, which would have remained red when the traffic signal turned green in favour of vehicles travelling from Braddell Road to CTE slip road (towards city).

9       By a letter dated 25 October 2018, the Traffic Police department of the Singapore Police Force (“Traffic Police”) informed the Plaintiff that the Defendant had committed the offence of “Careless Driving” under Rule 29 of the Road Traffic Rules (Cap 276, R 20, 1999 Rev Ed) (“Road Traffic Rules”). The relevant excerpt of the said letter reads:[^10]

> Please be informed that we have completed our investigations which revealed that the driver of \[the Defendant’s vehicle\] had committed an offence of **Careless Driving** under Rule 29 of Road Traffic Rules. Action has been initiated against the driver for the said offence.

## Parties’ submissions

10     The Plaintiff argued that the Plaintiff had the right of way at the material time and had rightly relied on the traffic signal turning green ahead of him.[^11] On the contrary:

> (a)     The Defendant had wrongly responded to the traffic signal ahead of him turning green, and should have instead abided by the traffic signal behind him which should have remained red at the material time.[^12]

> (b)     The Defendant should not have moved off without checking to ensure that vehicular traffic moving from Braddell Road towards CTE slip road (towards city) had come to a stop.[^13]

> (c)     The Defendant was wrong to have moved into the yellow box before the vehicle immediately in front of the yellow box had moved off.[^14]

11     The Plaintiff also submits that some weight should be given to the Traffic Police’s finding that the Defendant had committed an offence of careless driving under rule 29 of the Road Traffic Rules after conducting its investigations.[^15]

12     The Plaintiff submits that the Defendant should be 100% liable for the collision.[^16] In this regard, the Plaintiff claims to have taken evasive action by swerving his motor vehicle to his left before the collision.[^17]

13     The Defendant submits that he had properly complied with all traffic rules and signals in his path of travel.[^18]

> (a)     He rightly went past the traffic signal located at the mouth of the CTE slip road (from city) when it was still green.[^19]

> (b)     As there was a traffic build-up along the road leading into Braddell Road, the Defendant was unable to make it past the yellow box and thus stopped behind the yellow box.[^20]

> (c)     When the traffic signal ahead of him turned green, he commenced travel after noticing that the vehicles in front of the yellow box ahead had begun to move off.[^21]

> (d)     If there were no traffic build-up on that day, the Defendant would have cleared the cross junction without incident.[^22]

14     The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff’s case fails to take into account the traffic build-up that had occurred on that day which prevented many vehicles travelling in the direction of Upper Serangoon Road, including the Defendant’s, to safely make it across the yellow box junction when the traffic signal was operating in their favour.[^23] He also urged this court to consider that he was not wrong to have made it past the traffic signal located at the mouth of CTE slip road (from city) in the absence of any prohibitive road markings or traffic rules.[^24]

15     As regards the letter from the Traffic Police, the Defendant submits that the Defendant ultimately received only a warning letter on which no weight should be given because a warning does not amount to a conviction and has no legal effect. Further, parties are not at all privy to the considerations that led to the Traffic Police issuing the warning letter.[^25]

16     The Defendant further submits that the Plaintiff, with a clear line of sight of the Defendant’s vehicle inching towards the yellow box, is the party that could have taken steps to avoid the collision, and thus should be found contributorily negligent, with him bearing 50% of the liability.[^26]

## What weight should be given to the Traffic Police’s opinion?

17     It is often said that a criminal conviction is relevant to a subsequent civil determination of liability insofar as they both relate to the same set of facts (see for instance _Pollmann, Christian Joachim v Ye Xianrong_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 229</span> at \[28\] and _Soh Lay Lian Cherlyn v Kok Mui En_g <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 53</span> at \[23\]). The relevance of a criminal conviction was analysed in _Ong Bee Nah v Won Siew Wan (Yong Tian Choy, third party)_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 2 SLR(R) 455</span> (“_Ong Bee Nah_”), where Andrew Phang JC (as he then was) found that a defendant being convicted of driving without due care or consideration under s 65 of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 1994 Rev Ed) provided “extremely significant pieces of evidence that weighed very heavily” in a later civil trial on the issue of whether the defendant was negligent. The relevance stems from concessions made by the defendant in the criminal proceedings. In that case, the court found that the premise of the Charge and the Statement of Facts to which the defendant pleaded guilty directly contradicted and undermined the very basis of the case that the defendant tried to run in the civil proceedings. Section 45A of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) provides the statutory gateway through which the prior conviction becomes admissible in evidence:

> **Relevance of convictions and acquittals**

> 45A.—(1)    Without prejudice to sections 42, 43, 44 and 45, the fact that a person has been convicted or acquitted of an offence by or before any court in Singapore shall be admissible in evidence for the purpose of proving, where relevant to any issue in the proceedings, that he committed (or, as the case may be, did not commit) that offence, whether or not he is a party to the proceedings; and where he was convicted, whether he was so convicted upon a plea of guilty or otherwise.

> (2)    A conviction referred to in subsection (1) is relevant and admissible unless —

>> (a)    it is subject to review or appeal that has not yet been determined;

>> (b)    it has been quashed or set aside; or

>> (c)    a pardon has been given in respect of it.

> (3)    A person proved to have been convicted of an offence under this section shall, unless the contrary is proved, be taken to have committed the acts and to have possessed the state of mind (if any) which at law constitute that offence.

> (4)    Any conviction or acquittal admissible under this section may be proved by a certificate of conviction or acquittal, signed by the Registrar of the Supreme Court, the registrar of the State Courts or the registrar of the Family Justice Courts, as the case may be, giving the substance and effect of the charge and of the conviction or acquittal.

> (5)    Where relevant, any document containing details of the information, complaint, charge, agreed statement of facts or record of proceedings on which the person in question is convicted shall be admissible in evidence.

> (6)    The method of proving a conviction or acquittal under this section shall be in addition to any other authorised manner of proving a conviction or acquittal.

> (7)    In any criminal proceedings, this section shall be subject to any written law or any other rule of law to the effect that a conviction shall not be admissible to prove a tendency or disposition on the part of the accused to commit the kind of offence with which he has been charged.

18     There is no evidence of any charge levied against the Defendant in the present case. The Traffic Police alluded to taking action against the Defendant in their letter addressed to the Plaintiff, but the Defendant clarified during trial that all the Traffic Police did was administer a written warning.[^27] Apparently, he tried to dispute the warning but was told by the Traffic Police that there was no point appealing since it was merely a warning.[^28] A copy of that letter was not adduced in evidence. But since the Plaintiff did not challenge the Defendant’s testimony, I would proceed on the basis that the Traffic Police did in fact issue a warning letter to the Defendant.

19     None of the decisions tendered by parties had squarely examined the admissibility of a Traffic Police warning in civil proceedings. In my judgment, I am unable to attribute probative value to the Traffic Police warning in the present case. This court is not privy to the considerations underpinning the Traffic Police’s decision to administer a warning against the Defendant. While the issuance of that letter may mean that the Traffic Police regarded the Defendant as having committed an offence of careless driving, the court is still duty-bound to make its _independent_ assessment of the issue based on the available evidence and the applicable law. To rely on the Traffic Police’s assessment wholesale – without regard for its underlying premise – is tantamount to abdicating that duty. Taking the Plaintiff’s case at its highest, the Traffic Police’s finding may amount to opinion evidence. Sections 47-53 of the Evidence Act allows the admission of opinion evidence in specific circumstances. But the Plaintiff failed to identify which of those provisions, if any, would render the Traffic Police’s finding admissible. In any event, the Traffic Police is not called as an witness to testify on the basis of its conclusion. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that, unlike a criminal conviction wherein the underlying materials (such as the Charge, the Statement of Facts and Record of Proceedings) would shed light on the circumstances underpinning the court’s finding or the accused’s admission of guilt, there is no factual material in the letter issued by the Traffic Police that can credibly assist the court in its analysis. There is consequently no way for this court to properly assess the veracity of the Traffic Police’s findings and attribute probative value to it.

20     I am fortified in my view by the chorus of authorities affirming that warnings issued by the authorities have no legal effect. The leading decision is _Wham Kwok Han Jolovan v Attorney-General_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 1 SLR 1370</span> (“_Wham v AG_”), where Woo Bih Li J found that a warning was not binding on its recipient in a way that would affect his legal rights, interest or liabilities. In arriving at this ruling, Woo J followed the Court of Appeal’s _dicta_ in _Comptroller of Income Tax v ACC_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 2 SLR 1189</span> (“_ACC_”). In _ACC_, the Comptroller of Income Tax (the “Comptroller”) issued a letter informing the respondent that he was required to personally account for tax which should have been withheld. The respondent applied for a quashing order against the Comptroller’s letter and succeeded. On appeal, the Court of Appeal observed that the letter had no legal effect, and accordingly there was nothing in the letter for the court to quash (at \[21\]). The court elaborated:

> 25    The question thus arose as to whether the Comptroller’s determination was a decision which had actual or ostensible legal effect, whether direct or indirect, on the respondent. If that determination were made under a statutory power and were binding on the respondent unless and until it was set aside by a court, then it would certainly affect the rights of the respondent. If, on the other hand, the determination had no such effect, it would be nothing more than an expression of the Comptroller’s opinion or view as regards the respondent’s liability for withholding tax. Such a determination would be no more than advice to the respondent or an answer to the query by the respondent as to its liability for withholding tax, and the respondent was free to disregard the determination if it did not agree with it. In the present case, the respondent disagreed with the Comptroller’s determination, but did not feel free (from a commercial point of view) to disregard it. Hence, it paid under protest the withholding tax determined by the Comptroller and commenced these proceedings.

> 26    Despite the wording used in the 6 February 2009 Letter, we were doubtful if the Comptroller’s determination had any actual or ostensible legal effect (whether direct or indirect) on the respondent’s liability to pay the amount claimed by the Comptroller. There seems to be nothing in the \[Income Tax Act (Cap 134, 2008 Rev Ed)\] which gives the Comptroller the power to unilaterally determine an individual’s liability for withholding tax under s 45.

21     As such, Woo J refused to quash the warning administered to the applicant in _Wham v AG_, explaining as follows:

> 33    In my view, a warning is not binding on its recipient such that it affects his legal rights, interests or liabilities. It is, as its name suggests, nothing more than a warning, _ie_, a communication to its recipient that if he were to subsequently engage in conduct prohibited by a particular statutory provision, or any criminal conduct for that matter, leniency may not be shown to him and he may be prosecuted for it. I am mindful that a warning on its face may give the impression that the individual who receives it has in fact committed an offence. For example, a warning, even if given orally, would presumably identify the offence and other particulars like the date and venue. Indeed, the Notice of Warning in question identifies the offence and states the date and place of the offence. It also adopts language such as “in lieu of prosecution” and “the same leniency may not be shown towards you” which suggests that the relevant authority is of the view that the recipient has committed an offence and that he could have been charged for it.

> 34    However, in my view the warning is still no more than an expression of the opinion of the relevant authority that the recipient has committed an offence. _It does not bind the recipient. It does not and cannot amount to a legally binding pronouncement of guilt or finding of fact. Only a court of law has the power to make such a pronouncement or finding and this is not disputed between the parties. It follows that a recipient is entitled to challenge the warning._ …

> \[emphasis added\]

22     More recently, Sundaresh Menon CJ followed _Wham v AG_ in _Public Prosecutor v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 799</span> at \[113\]-\[115\], where he found that a warning is not an indicator of the relevant person’s guilt or degree of culpability, and therefore cannot be taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. Similarly, in _Public Prosecutor v See Li Quan Mendel_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 255</span>, Valerie Thean J, following _Wham v AG_, declined to treat the prior issuance of conditional warning as an aggravating factor in sentencing (at \[60(b)\]). In _GCO v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 1402</span>, See Kee Oon J also agreed with Woo J’s holding that warnings are merely an expression of the relevant authority’s opinion that an offence has been committed, and that it plays the informational function of informing the recipient that if he were to subsequently engage in criminal conduct, leniency may not be shown to him (at \[70\]-\[71\]).

23     The Plaintiff relies on the case of _Public Prosecutor v Koh Thiam Huat_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 1099</span> (“_Koh Thiam Huat_”) which held that the composition of traffic offences can be taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. In that case, See Kee Oon J took into account various compounded traffic offences when sentencing an offender convicted of dangerous driving (at \[56\]). See J elaborated in a later decision that composition is a relevant _indicia_ of a person’s driving record (see _Public Prosecutor v Ong Heng Chua and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 388</span> at \[42\]). There is however a conflicting High Court decision recently issued by Chua Lee Ming J casting doubt on the correctness of _Koh Thiam Huat_ (_Neo Chuan Sheng v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 97</span> (“_Neo Chuan Sheng_”)). In _Neo Chuan Sheng_, Chua J took the view that the composition of offence, in the absence of legislative intervention, does not amount to an admission of liability. This flows from the premise that a person may choose to compound an offence for a host of reasons other than an admission of liability (at \[33\]-\[35\]). In holding so, Chua J followed the Court of Appeal decision in _Lim Chor Pee_ <span class="citation">\[1990\] 2 SLR(R) 117</span>, which found that a composition made in the circumstances of that case did not amount to an admission of guilt, citing the following passages in _Lim Chor Pee_ as authority for that proposition:

> 55    … composition of an offence by an alleged offender cannot constitute an admission of guilt against him. The effect of a composition is that no further action can be taken by the prosecuting authority against the accused on the offence compounded or indeed any other offence in respect of which he could plead _autrefrois acquit or autrefois convict_ in respect of the offence compounded.

> 56    There are multiple reasons why a person may wish to compound an offence, whether it be an income tax offence or an offence compoundable under the \[Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed)\], without any admission of guilt …

24     The present case does not require me to take a position in the debate because _Koh Thiam Huat_ is readily distinguishable. The court in that case was concerned with the composition of offences, which entails both the authorities and the relevant person taking positive steps towards the incident concerned. On the authorities’ part, it makes a composition offer to the relevant person. On the relevant person’s part, he accepts the offer by paying the penalty prescribed in exchange for the authorities not proceeding with a charge. A warning does not entail any of these steps and does not result in any penalty. It merely informs the relevant person of the view taken by the authorities, and that informational function is all that it serves. In my judgment, warnings and compounded offences are quite different and the Plaintiff has mistakenly conflated them.

## Was the Defendant negligent?

25     I turn now to examine the whether the Defendant was negligent based on the available evidence with reference to the general legal principles. I propose to address this question sequentially as follows:

> (a)     Was the Defendant wrong to have driven past the traffic signal located at the mouth of the CTE slip road (from city)?

> (b)     Was the Defendant wrong to have stopped behind the yellow box demarcated in the cross junction?

> (c)     Was the Defendant wrong to have responded to the traffic signal ahead of him?

> (d)     Was the Defendant wrong to have accelerated forward without keeping a lookout for the Plaintiff’s vehicle?

> (e)     Was the Defendant wrong to have entered the yellow box before the vehicles immediately in front of the yellow box had cleared out?

### Was the Defendant wrong to have driven past the traffic signal?

26     Was the Defendant was wrong to have driven past the traffic signal located at the mouth of the CTE slip road (from city)? At that time, the traffic signal was green. The Defendant submits that the lane ahead of the traffic signal looked like any ordinary road that motorists could drive on, and the Defendant was not wrong to have done so. In support of his case, the Defendant cited _Ong Bee Nah_ where Andrew Phang JC (as he then was) held there is no general duty for motorists to slow down when approaching a junction (at \[95\]). In the absence of countervailing traffic rules, I find it hard to fault the Defendant for driving past the traffic signal. Based on his in-car video footage, it seems that the Defendant would have found it difficult to assess the traffic condition past the yellow box due to the curvature of the road and the obstruction posed by the flyover. A screenshot of the said footage is as follows:

![]([2020] SGMC 0039_Image/[2020] SGMC 0039_image6.png)

### Was the Defendant wrong to have stopped behind the yellow box?

27     Was the Defendant wrong to have stopped at the position he did? The Plaintiff is not asserting so. Nor did parties submit on any traffic rules that prohibit motorists from stopping in the lane in question. The Defendant submits that he had rightly stopped to avoid infringing upon the yellow box demarcated in the cross junction upon noticing that the lane across the junction had been filled to the brim. This is consonant with the rule 26 of the Road Traffic Rules which prohibits motorists from causing obstruction within yellow boxes to other motorists. Rule 26 reads:

> **Causing obstruction to vehicles proceeding along road junction**

> 26.    Any person who drives or rides, or turns a vehicle or part thereof into a yellow box indicated by yellow lines connecting the 4 corners of —

>> (a)    a road junction and hatching the junction diagonally, notwithstanding that the light signals controlling the movement of vehicular traffic permit him to do so; or

>> (b)    an area of road at a road junction or on any part of the road as defined under rule 7(8) of the Road Traffic (Traffic Signs) Rules (R 33), notwithstanding that he has the right of way,

> and by doing so causes obstruction to any other vehicle proceeding to or along that road junction or any part of the road shall be guilty of an offence.

28     Yellow boxes are meant to be clear in heavy traffic for the convenience of turning traffic (_Choo Eng Song and another v Ratan Singh s/o Garcharan Singh_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] SGHC 270</span>). Accordingly, the Defendant was not wrong to have avoided infringing upon the yellow box. Indeed, his in-car video footage shows that he was not the only one caught in the predicament that day; other vehicles were seen stopping behind the yellow box. It bears mentioning that the area where the Defendant stopped was not demarcated with a yellow box. The yellow boxes were demarcated before and after that area (see Images 4 and 5 above).

### Was the Defendant wrong to have responded to the traffic signal ahead of him?

29     The Plaintiff claims that the Defendant wrongly responded to the traffic signal ahead of him, which, in his view, was meant for the vehicles ahead that have already cleared the yellow box. I have some reservations with that submission. The green light signal that he relied upon was the first traffic signal ahead of him. There were no other traffic signals in the same lane on which he was travelling at the material time that he could reasonably rely on. With the benefit of hindsight, one realises that traffic signal was actually intended for the vehicles that have already cleared the yellow box. But the duty and standard of care is assessed objectively by reference to the prevailing circumstances _at the time of the accident_. As the Court of Appeal held in _PlanAssure PAC (formerly known as Patrick Lee PAC) v Gaelic Inns Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR(R) 513</span> at \[54\], the court should guard against using “_ex post facto_ knowledge” and should “refrain from assessing the situation with the benefit of hindsight”. Given the road features and traffic conditions on that day, I find it hard to fault the Defendant for responding to the traffic signal immediately ahead of him. Without any traffic signal or signage located in the middle of the junction to guide motorists stuck in the position as the Defendant did as a result of the traffic build-up, the Defendant’s instinctive reaction was to respond to the next traffic signal ahead.[^29] The Plaintiff cited no authority that says a motorist ought not to respond to traffic signals in the lane ahead of him in the present circumstances.

### Was the Defendant wrong to have moved ahead without keeping a lookout for the Plaintiff’s vehicle?

30     That said, I find that the Defendant was nevertheless negligent in two respects. The first is his failure to take evasive action against oncoming vehicular traffic despite having observed the traffic signal turning in favour of such traffic. The Defendant conceded during cross-examination that, right before leaving his stationary position, he noticed the traffic signal to his right (meant for vehicles travelling in the Plaintiff’s lane) turning green in conjunction with the traffic signal ahead of him.[^30] The Defendant also conceded that he should have kept a proper lookout for vehicles coming from his left in those circumstances.[^31] While I do not think motorists in ordinary circumstances have a duty to actively observe traffic signals directed at other lanes, the fact that he was put on notice of oncoming traffic cannot be ignored. He ought to have considered that his acceleration ahead would put him on a collision course with vehicles travelling along that lane. It is clear from the evidence that he failed to contemplate this eventuality, and I find him to be negligent to the extent that he did not do so.[^32] Although motorists are not required to view other road users as potential threats in ordinary circumstances, the emergence of an _actual_ threat ought to heighten his awareness. A motorist must make allowance for dangers on the road for which he had been put on notice and can reasonably avoid, even when the traffic light is in his favour. In _SBS Transit Ltd v Stafford Rosemary Anne Jane (administratrix of the estate of Anthony John Stafford, deceased)_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 211</span> (“_Stafford Rosemary_”), the Court of Appeal astutely analysed a motorist’s duty in the following terms:

> 34    The crux of the issue is what a reasonable person would apprehend in a particular set of circumstances. At one extreme is a driver of a car on an open road in dry weather and perfect visibility. He may drive at whatever speed his car can permit him safely to attain – subject to the legal speed limit – if he does not see any vehicle, person or animal that may obstruct his path. _However, once there is other traffic on the road, or there are pedestrians or animals at the roadside, or there are obstructions to his view, he must contemplate the possibility that any of these may impinge upon his path and must adjust his speed accordingly to one at which he can effectively stop or otherwise avoid a collision._ If the road is wet, then he must slow down even further because his braking distance is increased. If visibility is low, then he must proceed at a speed at which he can stop the car the moment an obstruction comes into view. If there are children walking alongside the road, he must contemplate the higher possibility of a child suddenly dashing across his path as compared to adult pedestrians. All these are essentially matters of common sense. Further, the driver must be aware at all times that his motor vehicle is, by reason of its mass and speed, a potentially dangerous weapon. The law requires that he handles it with good sense and common decency.

31     The following observations made by the Court of Appeal in _Hum Weng Fong v Koh Siang Hong_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 3 SLR(R) 1137</span> (“_Hum Weng Fong_”) at \[23\] are also instructive:

> 23    … A person who drives any vehicle, including a motorcycle, must keep a lookout at all times as his vehicle can turn into a lethal weapon. He should never permit himself to be lulled into thinking that he can somehow relax.

32     The upshot of these observations made by the Court of Appeal is that green light signals are not the be-all and end-all. They give motorists the right of way, not the right to ignore road hazards. In the face of an impending danger, motorists should take steps to avoid a collision where reasonably practicable. A motor vehicle is a dangerous weapon capable of inflicting untold harm onto other road users. With those dire consequences comes the responsibility to operate the vehicle with reasonable care.

33      _Loh Saik Pew_ <span class="citation">\[1974–1976\] SLR(R) 703</span> is another case that illustrates the principle that a green light signal does not invariably absolve motorists of liability. In that case, the Court of Appeal endorsed the following observations made by Barry J in _Godsmark v Knight Brothers (Brighton), The Times_, 12 May 1960 (“_Godsmark_”), a case involving two drivers who both obeyed the traffic lights when entering a road junction. Both of them were found to be negligent nonetheless. Barry J held:

> Here, the lights had just turned green in favour of Mr Knight (the defendant) and in his Lordship’s opinion … there was an obligation on Mr Knight to see that no other vehicles had entered the crossroads while the lights were amber … Mr Knight was bound to contemplate that some vehicle which had properly entered the crossroads might still be passing across, although the lights had changed to green; he was not entitled to cross in the way that he did. It was impossible to absolve him from blame.

34     Applying the principles laid down in _Godsmark_, the Court of Appeal held the respondent in that case was contributorily negligent even though he had proceeded with the green light in his favour. While he was entitled to do so, the court held that he should have in his own interest kept a lookout for vehicles coming from the direction of the other road for which the traffic lights were amber. Liability was reduced by 20% to reflect the respondent’s contributory negligence.

35     In the present case, the Defendant’s failure to consider the possibility of the imminent collision resulted in his failure to keep a proper lookout for the oncoming vehicular traffic. The Defendant claims that the vehicle to his left obstructed his view of the Plaintiff’s vehicle.[^33] But his passenger’s evidence was that he was able to see the Plaintiff’s vehicle hurtling towards them.[^34] Thus, even assuming the Defendant’s view was partially or fully obstructed by the vehicle beside him, he could have asked his passenger to check for the presence of oncoming traffic. Alternatively, he could have waited for several moments to ensure there was no oncoming vehicular traffic or adjusted his vehicle to get a better view of the oncoming traffic, before accelerating forward. It is clear from the evidence that he took no preventive measures.

### Was the Defendant wrong to have entered the yellow box at the moment he did?

36     Aside from failing to keep a proper lookout, I find that the Defendant also entered the yellow box prematurely.[^35] Rule 26 of the Road Traffic Rules prohibits a motorist from obstructing vehicles turning into yellow boxes. The video footage clearly shows the Defendant entering the yellow box when the vehicles right in front of the yellow box were still stationary. The passenger sitting in the Defendant’s vehicle confirmed as much.[^36] This would have necessarily prevented him from clearing the yellow box. Had he delayed his transit for several moments, he would have in all likelihood witnessed the Plaintiff’s vehicle crossing in front of him and be alerted of an imminent collision.

### Conclusion

37     In these premises, I find that the Defendant was negligent in failing to keep a lookout against vehicular traffic coming in the direction of the Plaintiff’s vehicle and taking measures to avert the collision. I also find that the Defendant had entered the yellow box prematurely. Indeed, the Defendant, by his position that liability should be apportioned equally between the parties, must have implicitly accepted that he was negligent, such that he ought to bear some responsibility for the accident.

## Was the Plaintiff contributorily negligent?

38     I turn now to the issue of contributory negligence. Contributory negligence connotes a claimant’s failure to take reasonable measures to guard against a foreseeable harm (_Asnah bte Ab Rahman v Li Jianlin_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 2 SLR 944</span> (“_Asnah_”) at \[18\]). The Defendant contends that the Plaintiff was contributory negligent for failing to take evasive action against the collision. I agree. The Plaintiff conceded during cross-examination that the Defendant’s vehicle was within his direct line of sight.[^37] A screenshot of the video footage taken using his in-car camera shows that the vehicle next to the Defendant’s (circled in blue) was almost directly ahead of the Plaintiff when he was entering the junction:

![]([2020] SGMC 0039_Image/[2020] SGMC 0039_image7.png)

39     The Plaintiff further agreed that, based on the video footage of his in-car camera, the Defendant’s vehicle (along with the vehicle to the Defendant’s left) were seen inching forward just as the Plaintiff was about to leave his stationary position.[^38] In my view, it was reasonably foreseeable that the Defendant’s vehicle was about to encroach into the Plaintiff’s path of travel. Being in the Plaintiff’s line of sight, he too should have taken evasive action to prevent the collision. With the Plaintiff travelling at about 20 km/h,[^39] taking about four seconds to reach the middle of the junction[^40] and about seven seconds to the point of collision,[^41] there would have been ample time for him to have sounded the horn,[^42] pressed the brakes or perhaps swerved to the side. The Plaintiff’s evidence was that he did not notice the vehicles inching forward[^43] and only noticed the Defendant’s approach about a second before the collision.[^44]

40     I agree with the Defendant that the traffic light signal does not absolve the motorist’s duty to take care of his own safety. The green light signal gives the motorist the assurance that the path ahead would be clear in ordinary circumstances. But if the motorist is nevertheless put on notice of an impending danger, he ought to take evasive action where reasonably practicable to prevent a collision from happening (_Stafford Rosemary_ at \[34\]). As a fellow motorist, the analysis at \[30\]-\[34\] above applies with equal force vis-à-vis the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff’s evidence was that he did not notice the Defendant’s vehicle (and the vehicle to his left) advancing towards his path of travel.[^45] In my view, he ought to have kept a proper lookout for their approach and taken evasive action.

41     Similarly in _Ng Swee Eng v Ang Oh Chuan_ \[2002\] 2 SLR(R) <span class="citation">\[2002\] 2 SLR(R) 321</span> (“_Ng Swee Eng_”), the Belinda Ang JC (as she then was) held that a motorcyclist is not immutably absolved of his duty to take care of his own safety simply because the traffic light was in his favour:

> 63    Even though the traffic light was, as I have found, in the motorcyclist’s favour, there is no rule of law that the motorist cannot be guilty of contributory negligence; it all depends on the facts of each case: _Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore_ vol 18 (Butterworths, 4th Ed) para 240.330. The deceased must take into account the carelessness of others: _Jones v Livox Quarries Ld; Same v Same_ <span class="citation">\[1952\] 2 QB 608</span> at 615; _Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore_ vol 18 (Butterworths, 4th Ed) para 240.327. A reasonable motorcyclist in the position of the deceased must anticipate that if he collides with a lorry he is likely to be injured more severely in a collision than the driver of a lorry. That imposes a duty on the motorcyclist to take care of his safety.

42     In _Ng Swee Eng_, the court reduced damages by 20% to account for the motorcyclist’s contributory negligence. The motorcyclist in that case was going straight on a major road and the defendant’s lorry was turning into the major road from a minor one. The evidence established that the defendant failed to check for oncoming traffic on the major road but at the same time the motorcyclist failed to keep a proper lookout as well.

43     The following observations made in _Stafford Rosemary_ at \[37\] are also apposite:

> 37    With respect, we do not agree that any motorist or motorcyclist in the position of the Deceased was entitled to assume that the bus would not move on while the lights remained green in his favour. To so hold would mean that the Deceased could proceed at a speed that did not take into account a mistake or error of judgment on the part of the bus driver, either in failing to observe that a motorcycle was approaching the Intersection or in adjudging it possible for the bus to make the turn before the motorcycle reached it. Such an assumption is certainly a wholly unsafe one to make. An intersection is that part of the road where a vehicle may cut across the path of other vehicles. When a motorist approaching an intersection sees a vehicle poised to make a turn across his path, the first thing that he must prepare for is the possibility that the other driver will make the turn before he clears the intersection. He must watch out for any indication that the driver might do so. Above all, he must drive his vehicle at a speed that enables him to react appropriately should this occur. The last thing that he should assume is that the vehicle will definitely wait for him to pass merely because he has the right of way according to road traffic rules. One must bear in mind that these rules are enacted for reasons of safety and to facilitate the smooth flow of traffic. Road users are entitled to assume that such rules will generally be followed, and indeed any person who fails to comply with any of these rules and breaches the law as a result may find himself charged with an offence and punished accordingly. But this assumption must be tempered with the realisation that, as in any activity, human failings and weaknesses always exist. These range from matters beyond the control of the individual to honest errors of judgment to intentional breaches of the law. An example of the first category is vehicle failure, such as brake or engine failure. Examples of honest errors of judgment are mistakes as to the law (_eg_, whether a U-turn is permitted) or mistakes as to physical factors (_eg_, the speed of oncoming traffic). The other extreme, intentional breaches of the law, would include speeding, illegal U- turns and running a red light. In between these extremes are instances such as inattention, or being distracted by the radio or a passenger or a mobile phone. The law requires every motorist to be aware of such realities and adjust the manner in which he uses his vehicle on the road to take these into account. …

44     A finding of contributorily negligence entitles the court to reduce the damages recoverable by the claimant to reflect the extent of his blameworthiness. This power is codified in section 3(1) of the Contributory Negligence Act (Cap 54, 2002 Rev Ed) which reads:

> 3.—(1)    Where any person suffers damage as the result partly of his own fault and partly of the fault of any other person or persons, a claim in respect of that damage shall not be defeated by reason of the fault of the person suffering the damage, but the damages recoverable in respect thereof shall be reduced to such extent as the court thinks just and equitable having regard to the claimant’s share in the responsibility for the damage.

45     The Plaintiff confirmed that he had no objections to this court apportioning damages notwithstanding this being a trial on liability. I therefore turn to determine the appropriate reduction in the Plaintiff’s damages to account for his contributory negligence.

46     Neither party cited any analogous precedents for my consideration. But the lack of precedents should not impede the assessment since the guiding principles are fairly established. The apportionment exercise is more of an art than science. It is a highly fact-sensitive exercise that cannot be reduced to a rigid formula (_Hum Weng Fong_ at \[26\]). Each case turns on its unique facts. Amongst the manifold considerations, two take pre-eminence in most cases: first, the relative causative potency of the parties’ conduct; and second, their relative moral blameworthiness (_Asnah_ at \[118\]).

47     In the present case, I consider the following circumstances to be relevant:

> (a)     Both parties had driven ahead in response to a green traffic signal.

> (b)     Neither of them was travelling at a high speed. In fact, the Defendant’s vehicle had barely accelerated when the collision occurred. The collision also did not appear to have inflicted serious personal injury and property damage.

> (c)     The unusual circumstances of the accident. For one, the cross junction was not the easiest to navigate. The traffic build-up compounded the difficulty. Indeed, the Plaintiff himself called the accident an “unfortunate” one.[^46]

> (d)     Their negligence stems from a failure to keep a proper lookout and take evasive action against impending dangers that they had or ought to have been put on notice. Both parties were somewhat blameworthy, but neither was grossly negligent.

> (e)     On balance, the Defendant was more negligent than the Plaintiff for two reasons. The first was his premature entry into the yellow box. Had he waited for the vehicles in front of the yellow box to clear out, he would have in all likelihood witnessed the passing of the Plaintiff’s vehicle and realised the imminent danger posed by the oncoming vehicular traffic. Second, the Defendant’s failure to react to the green light signal (in favour of the Plaintiff) was slightly more egregious than the Plaintiff’s failure to notice the approach of the Defendant’s vehicle in the present circumstances because the green light signal was more prominent as compared to the slow and slight forward motion of the Defendant’s vehicle under the flyover. I also take into consideration that the Plaintiff did swerve to the left just before the collision.[^47] Although it was too late to avert the collision, the impact would likely have been greater had he not done so.

48     Balancing the causative potency and moral blameworthiness of each of their actions and considering the circumstances in the round, I would reduce the damages recoverable by the Plaintiff by 35% to account for his contributory negligence.

## Conclusion

49     For the foregoing reasons, I order the Defendant to bear 65% of the damages arising from the accident. The quantum of the damages is to be assessed separately. I will hear parties on the costs of the proceedings.

50     I thank counsel for assisting this court with their submissions and research on the unusual factual matrix of this case.
