Criminal Law – Receiving Stolen Property

Criminal Procedure and sentencing – Statements

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9176/2020/01.\]

31 May 2020

### District Judge Mathew Joseph:

## Introduction

1       The accused Karunanithi Alagasamy claimed trial to two proceeded charges as below -

> “_DAC-921459-2017_

> _You are charged that you, on the 20th day of June 2017, at about 3pm, at Blk 11 York Hill #XXX, Singapore, did dishonestly receive stolen property, to wit, cash amounting to S$39,000, having reason to believe the same to be stolen property, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 411(1) of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Rev. Ed).”_

> “_DAC-921460-2017_

> _You are charged that you, on the 21st day of June 2017, at about 3pm, at Ceylon Sports Club located at 101 Balestier Road, Singapore, did dishonestly receive stolen property, to wit, cash amounting to S$30,000, having reason to believe the same to be stolen property, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 411(1) of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Rev. Ed).”_

2       At the conclusion of the trial, the accused was found guilty of both charges and sentenced to a total of 9 months imprisonment. He has appealed against his conviction and sentence. He is presently on bail pending appeal. I have also ordered a stay of execution on the sentence of imprisonment.

## Background

3       The accused was a Businessman. He was facing financial challenges in his business. He had received two large sums of money on two separate occasions. He had first received a sum of $39,000 from his elder brother Dorasamy. The very next day, he had received a second sum of $30,000 from one Sheramu, who was a friend of his brother. The accused claimed that he had no reason to believe that there was anything amiss when he received the two sums of money. Investigations were carried out. The accused was subsequently charged and he claimed trial for two counts of dishonestly _receiving_ stolen property under s 411 of the Penal Code relating to $39,000 on 20 June 2017 (“the first charge”) and $30,000 on 21 June 2017 (“the second charge”) having reason to believe the same to be stolen property.

## Undisputed Facts

#### Agreed statement of Facts

4       The facts below are undisputed and based on the Agreed Statement of Facts (“ASOF”) and also the testimony of the key Prosecution witnesses, Dorasamy, and Sheramu. On 18 June 2017 at about 6.15 pm,[^1] one Sheramu s/o Ayasamy (“Sheramu”),[^2] committed theft of $172,670 (“the stolen cash”) and two gold chains belonging to the victim, Ms Ammani Ponnusamy (“the victim”).[^3] The stolen cash amounted to the victim’s life savings.

5       On 19 June 2017, Sheramu handed $50,000 to Dorasamy s/o Allagasamy (“Dorasamy”)[^4] coming from the stolen cash, while informing him that it had been stolen from the victim.[^5] Dorasamy is the accused’s elder brother.

6       As both men knew that the police would be looking for them, they decided to find someone to look after the stolen cash. After some discussion, both men decided that they would keep the money with the accused.[^6]

7       At the time, the accused was facing severe financial difficulties with multiple people commencing lawsuits to recover loans from the accused amounting to approximately $400,000. [^7]

8       On 20 June 2017, at about 3.00 pm, the accused met up with Dorasamy at Blk 11 York Hill #XXX, Singapore.[^8] During this meeting, Dorasamy gave some money to the accused coming from the stolen cash. The accused did not count the money then, but he did count the money the next day (on 21 June 2017) and informed Dorasamy that he had received a sum of $39,000.[^9] The accused knew that the monies he received from Dorasamy were in turn obtained from Sheramu.[^10]

9       On 21 June 2017, the accused picked up Dorasamy and Sheramu in his car before driving to Ceylon Sports Club (“CSC”) located at 101 Balestier Road, Singapore. At about 3.00 pm, the accused received cash of $30,000 from Sheramu,[^11] also coming from the stolen cash.

10     On 26 June 2017, at about 8.30 pm, police officers placed the accused under arrest at his residence located at 16 Jalan Tenteram, Singapore, on suspicion of dishonestly receiving stolen property. A search of his house revealed a sum of _$65,264_ in cash, which was found inside his jacket that was inside a cupboard in the master bedroom which was then seized.[^12] Additionally, a sum of $26,135 was found in the UOB bank account belonging to the accused’s wife.[^13]

11     Up to the point of his arrest in the evening of 26 June 2017, the accused never informed the police officers at his apartment unit that he had received monies specifically from both Dorasamy and Sheramu sometime in the preceding week. In addition, the accused never volunteered information to the police officers regarding the cash hidden in his jacket even as they searched the master bedroom.

## Prosecution Case

12     It was the case for the Prosecution that the accused did not contest the actus reus of both charges of receiving the respective sums of cash from Dorasamy and Sheramu).[^14] It was submitted that the core issue to be determined was whether the requisite mens rea of the two charges had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt - that the accused had reason to believe that the cash he received was stolen property.

13     It was submitted that the Prosecution’s primary case was that the accused had reason to believe _at the time_ he received the respective amounts of cash of $39,000 and $30,000 from Dorasamy and Sheramu that these sums were stolen property. It was submitted that this should be the irresistible inference to be drawn by the Court due to:

> a.     the highly suspicious objective circumstances as to how the two transactions took place;

> b.     the belated nature of the accused’s defence at trial; and

> c.     the accused’s lies to the police prior to his arrest which are corroborative of his guilt.[^15]

14     At the same, the Prosecution also had an alternative case.[^16] The Prosecution’s alternative case was that when the accused was first confronted by Investigation Officer Kisho Abdul Khaliq (“IO Kisho”)[^17] outside his apartment unit on 26 June 2017, the accused was expressly informed about Sheramu’s theft of the victim’s life savings. Notwithstanding this, the accused dishonestly _retained_ the cash received from Dorasamy and Sheramu by wilfully withholding this information from the Police even as they searched his apartment unit having reason to believe at that juncture, that it was stolen property. It was submitted that if the court were to find that only the alternative case had been made out by the Prosecution, the court was invited to alter the present charges to state that on 26 June 2017, the accused did dishonestly _retain_ the respective amounts of $39,000 and $30,000, which he had reason to believe were stolen property. It was submitted that the court would then be entitled to convict the accused on both counts accordingly pursuant to s 128 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed).[^18] I will deal with this alternative submission at a later part of this judgment.

## Evidence of Prosecution witnesses

15     The two key Prosecution witnesses were Dorasamy and Sheramu. PW2 Sheramu had carried out the theft of the victim’s life savings. PW3 Dorasamy was the elder brother of the accused.

16     Given the nature and circumstances of the charge and the personal relationships involved, I considered the testimony of both witnesses with some circumspection. I will consider both their evidence together with the accused’s evidence, as the evidence of all these 3 actors in the unfolding play is inextricably linked.

## Case for the Defence

17     The accused elected to give evidence. He essentially denied the two charges stating that he did not know that the sums of money he had received were stolen moneys.

18     Counsel had also submitted that the accused had no reason to believe that the moneys he received from his elder brother were stolen property. In support of this submission, it was argued that there was a close relationship between the accused and Dorasamy. Further, the accused never contemplated that Dorasamy could be involved in a theft. Counsel further submitted that the accused had a strong basis for his genuine belief that he was receiving an informal loan from his brother’s friend. A further argument was that the lack of formal documentation was not a red flag for the accused as he is used to handling informal loans of the same or higher amount from his friends. Counsel had further argued that the conduct of the accused after he had received the moneys is inconsistent with someone who has reason to believe that he was handling stolen property.[^19]

19     As for Sheramu and Dorasamy, Counsel had submitted that Shermu was an unreliable witness and his credit should be impeached. On the other hand, it was submitted that Dorasamy was a credible witness even though in some areas, Sheramu did not corroborate Dorasamy. Further, the fact that the accused was the younger brother of Dorasamy did not by itself mean that Dorasamy was not a reliable witness.[^20]

## Legal issue for determination by the Court

#### Did the accused have the necessary mens rea

20     As mentioned earlier and as agreed among parties in the ASOF, the accused did not dispute having received the stolen property on the respective 2 occasions. The _actus reus_ of the offence is therefore not in dispute. The sole legal issue therefore is whether the accused had the requisite _means rea_, that is, whether he had _reason to believe_ the moneys he had received were stolen property.

## Reasons for decision and findings by the Court

#### The Offence under s. 411 (1) of the Penal Code

21     The offence under section 411 (1) of the Penal Code states as follows –

> 411.—(1)     _Whoever receives or retains any property, knowing or having reason to believe the property to be stolen property, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 5 years, or with fine, or with both._

### Key areas of evidence

22     I do not propose to go into all the evidence adduced during the trial nor consider all the arguments raised by both parties. Several facts are undisputed and contained in the ASOF. I will instead focus on the key areas of divergence among parties and the evidence adduced in support of the respective arguments and submissions. These key areas of evidence are –

> (i)      _The circumstances of the handing over of the stolen moneys at York Hill by the accused’s brother, Dorasamy_

> (ii)      _The circumstances of the handing over of the stolen moneys at CSC by the person who committed the theft, Sheramu_

> (iii)      _The lies given by the accused to IO Kisho at his home prior to the Police search_

> (iv)      _The explanation given by the accused after the search at his home revealed the hidden moneys_

> (v)      _The long statement of the accused_

> (vi)      _The defence of the accused_

23     I proceed now to examine each of these areas of evidence in turn.

#### (i)   The circumstances of the handing over of the stolen moneys at York Hill by the Accused’s brother, Dorasamy

24     The circumstances of the handing over of the stolen moneys at York Hill by the accused’s brother, Dorasamy forms the substance of the first charge. The ASOF and the testimony of Dorasamy establishes that on 20 June 2017, at about 3.00 pm, Dorasamy met up with the accused at Blk 11 York Hill #XXX, Singapore. During this meeting, Dorasamy gave some money to the accused coming from the stolen cash. The accused did not count the money then, but did count the money the next day (on 21 June 2017). He then informed Dorasamy that he had received a sum of $39,000. The accused knew that the monies received from Dorasamy were in turn obtained from Sheramu.[^21] I note also that during cross-examination, the accused testified that he had told his brother Dorasamy when the first sum of money was handed over to him, that he wanted to see “who this person (Sheramu) was.”[^22] I will return to this part of the accused’s evidence in a later part of the judgment.

25     It would be apposite to refer at this point to the Prosecution application to cross-examine their own witness.[^23]

26     Dorasamy had given a statement to the Police on 26 June 2017 at 2.00pm at Jurong Police Station. The statement was recorded by SI Sivanthan – Exhibit P3.

27     The Prosecution cross-examined Dorasamy on the underlined portions of the statement P3A which contained discrepancies from his testimony in court. At paragraph 3 of the statement, it was recorded that “_I told him I have some money from a friend and whether he can help me keep. My brother initially was hesitant but when I kept pleading he agreed_.” Dorasamy vehemently denied saying this to the recorder.

28     As part of its impeachment exercise, the Prosecution also cross-examined Dorasamy on further underlined portions of paragraph 3 of the statement P3A which also contained discrepancies from his testimony in court. The statements were “_I told my brother that Sheramu was the one who gave me money and he also need help to keep money for a while. I explained that we can’t keep the money in our bank accounts and need help_”. Dorasamy again strongly denied saying this to the recorder.

29     The Defence in response to this impeachment exercise by the Prosecution, submitted that Dorasamy’s oral testimony could not be substituted with the underlined portions of the statement P3A.[^24] It was further submitted that little weight should be given to P3A.[^25]

30     I was mindful that Dorasamy was the elder brother of the accused. I reminded myself however, that this by itself did not disqualify Dorasamy from being a credible witness.

31     Here, I pause to note that during cross-examination of Sheramu by Counsel, it was put to Sheramu that his agreement with Dorasamy was for the accused, when the stolen moneys were to be handed to the accused, to be told that the moneys had come from the sale of Sheramu’s flat. However, Sheramu in response had replied that this was incorrect and that Dorasamy was lying – “_How is he supposed to say all this?”_

32     Later when Dorasamy took the stand in EIC conducted by the DPP, he actually testified that the agreement between Sheramu and himself was for the accused to be told that the stolen moneys handed over to the accused had come from the sale of Sheramu’s flat.[^26]

33     During cross-examination of Dorasamy, when Sheramu’s denial of this agreement with Dorasamy was told to Dorasamy by Counsel, he replied that the conversation did take place. Dorasamy therefore maintained his position that he and Sheramu had together agreed that the accused would be told that the moneys had come from the sale of Sheramu’s flat.[^27]

34     In view of the above, I had cautioned myself to be circumspect with the evidence of Dorasamy. At the same time, section 147 (6) of the Evidence Act requires the court to treat the admitted previous statement as a separate piece of substantive evidence and to attribute to it the proper weight after a careful scrutiny of the totality of the evidence before the court.

35     In this regard, I am particularly mindful that there are parts of paragraph 3 of P3A which even differ from the ASOF. As an example, paragraph 8 of the ASOF contains specific details of the cash handover location at York Hill and also the specific amount of $39,000 handed over by Dorasamy to the accused. Similarly, paragraph 10 of the ASOF contains details of the specific location Ceylon Sports Club and the specific amount of $30,000 handed over by Sheramu to the accused. All these details are absent in paragraph 3 of P3A. So, it would appear that even the Prosecution case relies on the ASOF rather than paragraph 3 of P3A. Furthermore, I note that Dorasamy had stated during cross examination by the DPP that the underlined portions of P3A were specifically asked by him to be deleted during his plead guilty mention for his own case involving the stolen moneys that he had received from Sheramu. Dorasamy also testified that his request for deletion was agreed to by the DPP having conduct of that earlier plead guilty mention. Significantly, this evidence was not challenged by the Prosecution, nor was any rebuttal witness called by the Prosecution on this issue.

36     In view of the above, I have given little weight to Dorasamy’s statement P3A that was admitted into evidence after the Prosecution’s impeachment exercise.

#### (ii)   The circumstance of the handing over of the stolen moneys at CSC by the person who committed the theft, Sheramu

37     Concerning the second charge involving the sum of $30,000 handed over on 21 June 2017, the accused had picked up Dorasamy and Sheramu in his car before driving to Ceylon Sports Club (“CSC”) located at 101 Balestier Road, Singapore. At about 3.00 pm, the accused received cash of $30,000 from Sheramu. This sum of money also came from the cash stolen from the victim’s residence by Shreamu. Here, I note that during cross-examination, the accused confirmed that during the 20-30 minute CSC lunch meeting, he did not ask Sheramu anything about his personal life or about his friendship with his brother Dorasamy. [^28]

#### (iii)   The lies given by the accused to IO Kisho at his home prior to the search

38     The two key events that took place at the home of the accused need to be carefully examined.

39     On 26 June 2017, at about 8.30 pm, police officers placed the accused under arrest at his residence on suspicion of dishonestly receiving stolen property. A search of his house had revealed a sum of $65,264 in cash, which was found inside his jacket that was inside a cupboard in the master bedroom which was then seized. Additionally, a sum of $26,135 was found in the UOB bank account belonging to the accused’s wife.

40     It has to be borne in mind that up to the point of his arrest in the evening of 26 June 2017, the accused had (i) _never informed_ the police officers at his apartment unit that he had received monies specifically from both Dorasamy and Sheramu sometime in the preceding week and (ii) further, the accused had never _volunteered_ information to the police regarding the cash kept hidden in his jacket, even as they commenced the search of the master bedroom.

#### The two lies given by the accused to IO Kisho

41     In the preceding paragraphs, I have given an account of the events that transpired at the home of the accused when the Police arrived as part of their investigations into the theft of the moneys stolen from the victim by Sheramu. There is also an exchange at the home of the accused between IO Kisho and the accused which requires careful scrutiny. It is also an issue on which both the DPP and Counsel had differing views as to its effect as regards the guilt of the accused.

42     In essence, this exchange involved what IO Kisho had asked the accused and the answers given in reply by the accused. IO Kisho had testified that shortly before the accused’s apartment was searched on 26 June 2017, the accused had answered in the negative to IO Kisho in response to two questions he had posed to the accused: “Did Dorasamy give you any cash?” and “Do you know who Sheramu is?”[^29] The accused replied in the negative for both questions. It is undisputed that these were deliberate lies, as the accused himself later confirmed during cross-examination.[^30] I will discuss these lies in detail in a later part of this judgment.

#### (iv)   The explanation given by the accused after the search at his home revealed the stolen moneys

43     The conduct of the accused when confronted is always relevant when considering his explanations and also his subsequent defence at trial.

44     The arresting officers, PW4 IO Kisho and PW6 IO Samuel Koh Su En (“IO Samuel”)[^31] gave corroborated evidence that a search of the accused’s bedroom led to them finding large sums of cash hidden in the accused’s jacket. The two Officers had both asked the accused to explain what the money was and the source of the moneys. IO Kisho had testified that the accused initially did not reply when asked by IO Samuel about the moneys found. IO Kisho therefore then asked the same question again as to what the discovered money was. The accused did not answer the question directly. He merely replied that it is for his business.[^32]

45     IO Samuel had also corroborated the above account by IO Kisho. IO Samuel further testified that his colleague IO Nye (not called as a witness) had also asked the accused where the money came from. The accused had replied that the money was for his business. In response to a question from the DPP whether the accused had ever explained or had given an answer as to where the money came from, IO Samuel said the accused only said that the money was for his business.[^33]

#### (v)   The long statement of the accused

46     At the close of the Defence case, the DPP made an application to recall the recorder of the accused’s long statement (later admitted into evidence as exhibit P5). P5 had never been previously admitted as part of the Prosecution case. It was the position of the DPP that during cross examination, the accused had alleged that he had told the recorder of his statement, IO Kisho, that he was told by Dorasamy that the moneys handed to him had come from the sale of Sheramu’s flat. The accused had alleged that this information given by him to IO Kisho was _not_ inserted by IO Kisho into his statement P5. I allowed the DPP’s application to recall IO Kisho and admitted P5 into evidence as it was not challenged.

47     During his recall, IO Kisho testified that the accused had never told him during the recording of P5, that Dorasamy had told the accused that the moneys handed to him had come from the sale of Sheramu’s flat.[^34] The Defence however submitted that IO Kisho had stated during cross-examination that he had several conversations with the accused which he had not recorded.[^35] It was therefore likely that he may have also similarly overlooked to record what the accused had said regarding the source of the moneys handed to him.

48     I was unable to accept this submission by the Defence. I had observed IO Kisho while he gave his evidence. He had impressed me as a reliable witness. He was also candid in his answers and had readily admitted to Counsel that he had failed to record some of the contemporaneous statements made by the accused on the day the officers went to his home and also when the accused was subsequently brought back to Jurong Division. At the same time, he had given an unequivocal “No” when he was asked by the DPP whether this particular explanation on the source of the moneys found at the accused’s home had been told to him by the accused. I therefore accepted IO Kisho’s evidence as I found him to be a credible witness. As regards the claim of the accused that he had told IO Kisho that he was told by Dorasamy that the moneys he handed to him had come from the sale of Sheramu’s flat, I was of the firm view that this was clearly an afterthought at trial.

#### (vi)   The defence of the accused

49     The accused had denied both charges. He had testified that he did not have reason to believe that the sums he received were stolen property. He also claimed that he accepted that the moneys were proceeds from the sale of Sheramu’s flat as told to him by his brother Dorasamy regarding the sum of $39,000. As for the sum of $30,000 handed to him at CSC a day later, he testified that he believed that Sheramu was giving him a loan.

### Reasons for decisions and finding by court

50     The Prosecution had called a total of 6 witnesses. Besides himself, the accused had also called his wife as part of his defence.

51     As in all cases, the Prosecution and the Defence had different versions of the circumstances surrounding the two transactions when the stolen moneys were handed to the accused. There was divergence also on the inferences to be drawn from the objective facts that were proved in court of the acts that took place on 20 and 21 June 2017. It then became the words of the Prosecution witnesses against the words of the accused and his wife. Under these circumstances, the court has then to assess whether the Prosecution witnesses’ evidence are more credible than that of the accused. The court also has to look for internal and external consistencies and inconsistencies. The court also makes reasonable inferences from objective evidence before the court. I will not dwell on the law in this area as both the Prosecution and Defence had made extensive written submissions on the issue of credibility of a witness and the veracity of their testimony given in court.

52     The starting point for this case is the ASOF. Parties had agreed to this set of facts and it is this set of facts that the court will primarily draw its inferences from and base its conclusions upon, while considering at the same time the totality of all the other evidence before the court.

53     The court also considered the evidence of the various witnesses. Apart from the accused’s story, it was quite clear that the two key Prosecution witnesses are Sheramu and Dorasamy, the elder brother of the accused. I have observed all the witnesses carefully when they gave their evidence in court.

54     It has been succinctly stated that while a trial judge should observe and assess a witness’s demeanour and behaviour on the witness stand, the Court of Appeal in _Sandz Solutions Strategic and Others v Worldwide Assets Limited <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGCA 27</span> (“Sandz Solutions Strategic”)_ at paragraph \[46\] had also cautioned that such observations should seldom be the sole basis on which the court determines the credibility of a witness and the veracity of his evidence.

55     There will likely be discrepancies and inconsistencies in any witness’ testimony. As such, the court must recognize and give reasonable allowance for human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection. I am also mindful of the dangers of over-reliance on the recollection of witnesses in the witness stand. It is axiomatic that a witness should not be judged to be less credible merely because of gaps in his memory, particularly where a long period of time has passed since the occurrence of the events in question. Ultimately, the trial judge has to consider the totality of the evidence in determining the veracity, reliability and credibility of a particular witness’s evidence.

56     I should also state that as between these 2 witnesses Sheramu and Dorasamy, both were involved, albeit differently, in the original theft of the stolen moneys of $172, 670 from the victim, PW1 Mdm Ammani. Sheramu himself carried out the theft while Dorasamy had later received some of the stolen moneys from Sheramu knowing that it was stolen moneys. Both were convicted and were serving sentence for their role in the theft and receipt of these stolen moneys. Notwithstanding that they were already serving sentence when they gave their testimony, I was mindful of this important fact and evaluated their respective testimony in court very carefully.

57     In this regard, it is also significant that the Prosecution had applied to cross-examine with a view to impeach their own witness, Dorasamy, the elder brother of the accused. In similar vein, the Defence had sought to impeach the credit of the other key Prosecution witness, Sheramu. I was therefore very careful in these somewhat unusual circumstances, to give enhanced scrutiny to the evidence of both Sheramu and Dorasamy. I had observed them carefully while they were giving their evidence, in particular their demeanour and the internal and external consistency of their evidence. I further had to satisfy myself that they were entirely credible witnesses and that their testimony was coherent, consistent and credible. If it was not so, I had to consider the other available evidence, including the ASOF, the other witnesses and the accused’s own story.

### Applicable legal principles

58     As stated earlier, the key issue was whether the requisite mens rea necessary to prove a charge under s. 411 (1) of the Penal Code had been satisfied. The law in this respect is clear. Both the Prosecution and the Defence referred to the test laid down by the High Court in _Ow Yew Beng v PP \[2003\] 1 SLR (R) 536_ at paragraph 10 –

> _““Reason to believe” was defined in Koh Hak Boon v PP <span class="citation">\[1993\] 2 SLR(R) 733</span> as involving a lesser degree of conviction than certainty but a higher one than speculation. The test is whether a reasonable person, in the position of the appellant (ie including his knowledge and experience), would have thought it probable that the property he retains is stolen property. It is irrelevant whether the appellant himself actually thought it probable: his state of mind is only relevant to the “knowing” limb (which the present charges did not rely on) and not to the “reason to believe” limb in s 411. The test of “reason to believe” is hence objective but conducted from the vantage point of someone with the appellant’s knowledge and experience._

59     The Defence also referred to the later pronouncements like _Abdul Ghani bin Tahir v PP <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 1153</span>_ where the High Court also stated that ‘mere carelessness, failure to inquire and ‘reason to suspect’ would not constitute a “reason to believe.” It was also noted that the presence of suspicious circumstances is insufficient to cross the threshold of “reason to believe.’

60     At the same time, the Defence also made clear that the burden of proof remains with the Prosecution to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, even if the accused’s evidence is unreliable, or his credibility has been thrown into doubt. It was emphasized that a suspicion, even a grave suspicion, is no substitute for proof beyond a reasonable doubt. In particular, I note the succinct words of Rajah J (as he then was) in the case of _PP v Chee Cheong Hin Constance \[2006\] 2 SLR (R) 24_ – a case that was submitted by the Defence – “However, if more than one reasonable inference can be elicited from the factual matrix, the inference most sympathetic to the accused ought to be accepted.”

61     With the above legal principles to guide the court, I considered the factual matrix before the court, paying careful attention also to the ASOF. I also drew reasonable inferences where appropriate.

## First Charge – Receiving $39,000 from his brother at York Hill on 20 June 2017

62     The accused is an experienced Businessman. He knows all about loans. Yet he was unconcerned and even indifferent as to the terms of the purported loan. The amount was in cash. Further, it was certainly not a paltry sum, but a huge sum of $39,000. There was no mention of when the loan was to be repaid or any interest rate for the loan. Importantly, there was no documentation. And the moneys came from his brother’s friend Sheramu, whom he had never met before until the meeting at CSC the next day, for a second transfer of money to him.

63     I was also mindful that during cross-examination the accused had admitted that in view of his brother’s background, he could not have gotten this large sum of money legitimately –

> Q    Now, when you received on the 20th of June the $39,000 in cash from Dorasamy, you knew that there is no way that he could have gotten this money on his own. That means he could not earn this legitimately.

> A     **Yes.**

> Q     Not in the time that he was released from prison and definitely not on the income he was earning at that time.

> A     **Yes.**

> Q    Now, given his own financial difficulties, he did tell you that he had obtained this sum of money from a friend, correct?

> A     **Yes.**

> (Emphasis added)

64     In view of the above answers given by the accused, the fact that he did not ask his brother for more details of the purported ‘loan’ given to him by Sheramu or the interest to be paid, when he knew that Dorasamy had only recently been released from prison and was not earning a high income, is rather puzzling. Surely the accused would have been concerned that his brother was over extending himself to help him, given his limited means. It would appear that the accused was quite happy to accept and believe whatever his brother told him, no matter how incredulous it appeared.

## Second Charge – Receiving $30,000 from Sheramu, his brother’s friend at Ceylon Sports Club a day later on 21 June 2017

65     This time, the source of funds was purportedly from the proceeds of the sale of Sheramu’s flat. I noted that the money was handed over during lunch at CSC over the space of about 20-30 minutes. The accused testified that he did not engage in any conversation with Sheramu. There was no friendly banter between the two of them either. I find this silence most odd – especially considering that the accused had just been given a bail out, given his own financial problems at that time. One would have reasonably expected the accused to be profusely thanking Sheramu for his extreme and unexpected kindness. The sound of silence in this case was deafening - and not at all believable or credible.

66     I note also that the Defence had proffered several explanations as to why the accused had no reason to believe that he was receiving stolen moneys. I will therefore consider the key defence arguments and also their table of answers of the various Prosecution witnesses, including IO Kisho who had recorded a statement from the accused – P5.[^36]

67     As regards the narrative of the accused, one explanation proffered by the Defence in respect of a critical area of the evidence before the court, was in respect of the lies uttered by the accused in response to two specific questions posed by IO Kisho – see paragraph \[38\] above. The two specific questions were “Did Dorasamy give you any cash?” and “Do you know who Sheramu is?” Let me elaborate.

68     A reference to a _“Lucas lie”_ and whether this amounts to corroboration of evidence of guilt, and the requirements needed to be fulfilled was laid down by the English Court of Appeal in _Regina v Lucas (Ruth)__<span class="citation">\[1981\] QB 720</span>_ at 724. These requirement have since been accepted in Singapore by the Court of Appeal in _PP v Ilechukwu Uchechukwu Chukwudi <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 33</span>_ –

> (a)     The lie told out of court is deliberate;

> (b)     It relates to a material issue;

> (c)     The motive for the lie is a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth; and

> (d)     The statement must clearly be shown to be a lie by independent evidence.

69     In the present case, the accused’s lies were clearly deliberate ones relating to material issues and which have been independently proven to be untrue. Even the accused himself admitted that he had lied to IO Kisho.[^37] Further, the subsequent search of the accused’s home revealed the stolen moneys kept in the inside pocket of his jacket.

70     As such, the accused needs to explain the motive for his lie – whether he had lied for innocent reasons, or whether he had intentionally lied out of a realization of his guilt and because he knew that telling the truth would immediately link him to a crime.

71     What was the accused’s explanation? His explanation was that he had given the answer in a moment of fear and stress. I reproduce his answers during cross-examination to provide a clearer background to his answers –

> Q    But in any case, you asked---are you sure---I---rather, are you certain whether IO Kisho had asked you whether Dorasamy had given you any money?

> A     **Yes, that I’m very sure he asked me.**

> Q    And this was outside your house at that point in time?

> A    Yes, it was outside the house.

> Q     And your answer to him was “no,” Dorasamy did not give you any money.

> A     **Yes.**

> Q    Now, during this line of questioning, IO Kisho still did not raise his voice at any point in time, correct?

> A    That’s right, he did not raise his voice.

> Q    He was talking to you normally.

> A    Yes.

> Q     Now, could you just explain to the Court where was this great fear that you suddenly felt as to why you said no to IO Kisho?

> A     **When he introduced himself as police saying that he came from the station and he s---and he said that he is come to enquire about Dorasamy, so I got frightened.**

> Q     Is that it?

> A     **Yes.**

> Q    Now, Mr. Karunanithi, I’m finding it difficult to understand the logic of your answer. On one hand---okay, let---let’s establish a little bit. At the point in time when you told IO Kisho “no”, you know this was untrue, correct?

> A     **Yes.**

> Q     Would you consider yourself generally as a law-abiding citizen? What’s your answer?

> A     **I don’t know.**

> Q    You don’t know if you are generally a law-abiding citizen?

> A    What do you mean by law-abiding?

> Q     Do you generally obey the law?

> A     **Yes, I do.**

> Q     Alright. So your first reaction to police officers coming to your house is to lie to them. Is that it?

> A     **Yes.**

> (Emphasis added)

72     From the exchange above, it is clear that the accused’s excuses for the lies were quite illogical, unbelievable and wholly unsatisfactory. It is abundantly clear in my view that the accused had deliberately lied because he had to distance himself from both Dorasamy and Sheramu, as he had received moneys from them which he had reason to believe were stolen moneys. His so-called explanation was not reasonable and the only other acceptable explanation for the lies was his realization of his own guilt.

73     Furthermore, I find it most telling that the accused had given not one, but two lies back-to-back in answer to IO Kisho. This was clearly not fear of a police officer who was merely carrying out investigations. On the contrary, it was motivated by a desperate Houdini-style attempt to extricate himself from an impossible situation. It was simply not possible for the accused to tell one lie and one truth to the two very specific questions deliberately posed by IO Kisho. The accused therefore had no choice but to tell two lies – or to tell the entire truth. He chose the former. In these circumstances, I am drawn to the irresistible inference and inevitable conclusion that the accused had told the two lies out of a realization of his own guilt and a fear of the truth.

74     In any case, as further elaborated by the CA in _PP v Ilechukwu Uchechukwu Chukwudi_ at paragraph \[ 62 \] –

> “a lie that is not corroborative of guilt can still be relied upon to make a finding that an accused person is not creditworthy. The evidence of a witness who is demonstrably economical with the truth _without any good reason_ ought to be treated with a healthy level of caution, _a fortiori_, if it indicates a propensity to change his evidence as the trial proceeded. In fact, lies can be taken into account when assessing the creditworthiness of an accused person even if he has a valid reason for lying, as was held in _Heng Aik Peng v Public Prosecutor_ \[2002\] 3 SLR 469 at \[27\]:

>> _27_      **The distinction between relying on an accused’s lies as evidence of guilt and forming a view that his evidence is not creditworthy because of certain lies is an extremely important one.** _As pointed out by the court in _R v Lucas _(\[24\]_ supra), _an accused person may lie for a variety of reasons not connected with guilt of the offences. As such, it is dangerous to convict an accused person based on the fact that he lied, unless the criteria in_  Er Joo Nguang v PP _(\[24\]_ supra) _are satisfied._ On the other hand, **there can be no objection to a court’s reliance on such lies to reach a finding that an accused person’s evidence lacks creditworthiness, since the lack of credibility does not automatically lead to his conviction…………**_.”_

> _\[emphasis added in bold and italics\]_

75     The CA went on to add that a court has to give careful consideration to such lies and omissions, as well as to an accused person’s explanations (or lack thereof) for those lies and omissions, in determining the creditworthiness of the accused. I will return to this point in a later part of this judgment when considering the creditworthiness of the accused, especially in relation to his defence.

76     As indicated earlier at paragraph \[24\], the accused was not forthcoming in his answers. Indeed, I formed the distinct impression that he was even being evasive. This exchange during cross-examination was telling –

> _Q_      _Alright. Insofar as you are concerned, you didn’t need to meet him, correct, you can ask for a bank transfer?_

> _…………………………………………………………………………_

> _A_      **_I could have but I had a different reason for wanting to meet him._**

> _Q_      _And the reason would be?_

> _A_      **_Because the first amount that my brother gave me, he said that he---he had obtained this money from this Sheramu. So I wanted to see who this person was, so I then told my brother to make the arrangement to meet._**

> _Q_      _And notwithstanding that, you chose not to ask him any questions when you finally met._

> _A_      **_Because nothing to talk._**

> _Q_      _Then what’s the point of meeting him?_

> A     **_Because he said he wanted loan money to me, that’s why I said I’ll meet._**

> **_(Emphasis added_** _)_

77     The accused had testified clearly that on the first occasion that he was handed the sum of $39,000 by Dorasamy who had also told him that the money was from his friend Sheramu, he told Dorasamy that he wanted to meet Sheramu – _“I wanted to see who this person was.”_ Implicit in this statement is the accused himself acknowledging that he was keen to ascertain the identity of his kind benefactor, as clearly the sum of money was large and also that it was an unsolicited large amount. This being the case, it would have been entirely reasonable and even expected of the accused to ask questions of Sheramu when they met for the very first time at CSC. Further, on this _first_ meeting between Sheramu and the accused, Sheramu handed over another large sum of $30,000 to the accused and even telling him that he could spend the money and pay him back later.[^38] Under these circumstances, it was therefore inexplicable that over a not brief, but a 20-30 minute lunch, the accused did not have any questions or clarifications for Sheramu. In his own words, it was _“Because nothing to talk.”_ I found this silence most deafening.

78     Moving on, there is another aspect of the accused’s testimony that also leads me to the conclusion that he was not a creditworthy witness.

79     During the cross-examination of the accused and as I had mentioned earlier at paragraph \[46\], the accused had claimed that he had actually informed IO Kisho that Dorasamy had told him that that the $39,000 handed to him came from the sale proceeds of Sheramu’s flat and that IO Kisho did not record this in his statement P5.

80     As expected, the Prosecution was then compelled to apply to recall IO Kisho as a rebuttal witness. I allowed the application. IO Kisho went on to testify on this issue and stated unequivocally that the accused had never made such a statement during the recording of P5.[^39]

81     For completeness, I should observe that IO Kisho maintained his position during vigorous cross-examination by Counsel on this same issue.[^40] He even quite candidly agreed with Counsel that he did not ask the accused about the source of the funds he received from Dorasamy in the way that Counsel had suggested. In his explanation, IO Kisho clarified that he “took a different approach” and had posed the question of the source of the funds in a different way as expressed at Q9 of the long statement P5. Further, when Counsel pressed further to suggest that the issue of the source of the funds did not feature heavily on his mind and that “_even_ if Mr. Karuna had mentioned it in passing, it may not have been something important for you to note down, correct?”, IO Kisho firmly disagreed and maintained that he would have written it down, if the accused had indeed made such a statement.[^41] Under these circumstances, I was of the view that IO Kisho was a credible and truthful witness. I therefore accepted his evidence on this issue that the accused had not told him that Dorasamy had told him the source of the funds was from Sheramu.

82     In view of the above, this claim of the accused was clearly an afterthought made at trial. I am fortified in arriving at this conclusion for the following reasons. First, this claim by the accused was the exact same position taken by Dorasamy who had testified before the accused. Second, as mentioned at paragraph \[31\], Sheramu had strongly denied that he had made this statement to Dorasamy, as he did not own a flat and this was also known to Dorasamy. As such, the accused who had obviously heard Dorasamy giving his evidence when he was testifying earlier on the stand, conveniently took this same position to give himself an escape route, fortuitously given to him by his brother.

83     In these circumstances and also noting that IO Kisho had emphatically denied that the accused had provided such information during the recording of P5, I accordingly rejected the accused’s self-serving claim. In sum, I had found him to be an unreliable witness and prone to embellishment of his story where it suited his own purposes and without any regard for the truth.

### Applying legal principles to facts

84     Having considered all the above evidence in its totality, I had to apply the test of whether a reasonable person in the accused’s position would have thought it probable that the moneys he had received were stolen moneys. It was succinctly put by Yong CJ in the case of _Ow Beng Yew v PP_ that the question was whether “this entire mosaic of odd coincidences and occurrences would have led a reasonable man to think that the moneys received were probably stolen moneys.” I note further that CJ Yong had emphasized that in applying the Koh Hak Boon test, the court assumes the position of the individual (including his knowledge and experience), but reasons from that position like an objective reasonable man: _Koh Hak Boon v PP_ (\[10\] supra) at \[13\].

85     I highlight the following key points of the evidence adduced before the court.

86     The accused was an experienced businessman. He was in financial difficulties. His brother hands him in cash, a huge sum of $39,000 and says that the money is from his friend. The accused has never met this friend before at that time. There was no documentation involved. His brother works as a Cleaner and was only recently released from prison. Here, I note that Sheramu also worked as a cleaner.

87     A mere 24 hours later, his brother coincidentally, wants the accused to meet his friend. The accused agrees. At this meeting, the accused is now given another large sum of money. This time, he is given a purported ‘loan’ of $30,000 in cash. Again there is no documentation and no terms or interest rate discussed. The Accused does not engage in conversation with his benefactor, not even to thank him. It seems that there is a certain hurriedness to the whole transaction, with all three parties eager to keep the encounter short and silent.

88     With the above facts in mind and drawing reasonable inferences from these primary facts, I assumed the position of the accused (including his knowledge and experience) but I reasoned from that position as an objective reasonable man.

89     I came to the inevitable and firm conclusion that it while it was certainly not impossible for both his brother and Sheramu to come into sudden huge wealth at both the same time, it was inherently improbable enough to alert the accused that these were actually stolen moneys. The accused had received two huge sums of money – all in Cash – and within the span of a mere 24 hours. Was this a mere coincidence or a kindly but odd occurrence? There was no documentation for these huge sums of cash. There was not even a simple IOU Note asked for by Dorasamy or Sheramu when they parted with this huge amount of Cash. The accused did not know Sheramu and had met him for the first time when the second lot of Cash was handed over at CSC. Even here, the accused did not engage in any meaningful conversation with Sheramu, his kind benefactor. The accused did not even thank Sheramu. It was undisputed that the accused had financial problems at this time. Admittedly, he would therefore be eager and willing to receive any form of help from anyone, even a total stranger whom he had just met, albeit a friend of his elder brother. At this juncture, I pause to observe that to rely on the family relationship as one of complete and total trust –in these unusual and odd circumstances involving huge amounts of Cash – is in my view, quite misguided, unwise and unreasonable. Further, in reply to the DPP’ s question on needing some form of documentary protection for himself, the accused had given the strange and defiant reply _“Why do I need protection.”_? This was an answer that on the one hand appeared clumsy and flippant. In my view, having regard to the surrounding circumstances relating to the receipt of both sums of money from Dorasamy and Sheramu, it was indubitably an evasive answer. It was also a desperate attempt to avoid the suggestion and reasonable inference that the accused’s _“thinking skills had become suddenly paralysed_.” However, I do not think that the accused being the experienced businessman he was, had suddenly abandoned his thinking skills. On the contrary, from the facts and surrounding circumstances, on the two almost simultaneous and back-to-back occasions that he had received these huge sums of money from Dorasamy and Sheramu, the accused clearly had reason to believe that the moneys he had received were stolen moneys.

90     I was therefore satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had received the moneys on the two occasions having reason to believe that they were stolen moneys.

### Alternative submission by Prosecution

91     Finally and for completeness, I should mention that the Prosecution also had an alternative submission – that the accused had dishonestly _retained_ the stolen moneys after having been told by IO Kisho during the search of his house, that the search was in respect of stolen moneys. In view of my finding above, it would not be necessary for the court to make a separate determination on the Prosecution’s alternative submission.

## Conclusion

92     In the final analysis of all the evidence before me, I was satisfied that the ASOF and the rest of the Prosecution’s evidence was credible and that a conviction based on the evidence before the court could not be said to be unsafe. In sum, the defence had failed to raise any reasonable doubt in my mind as to the guilt of the Accused. In conclusion, I find that the Prosecution has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

93     The accused is accordingly found guilty and convicted of the two proceeded s. 411 (1) Penal Code charges against him.

## Antecedents

94     The accused was involved in unrelated road traffic antecedents in 1984. He also had a theft conviction in 1986 for which he was sentenced to a fine. In 1994, he again had theft convictions and also convictions for fraudulent possession of property, for which he received a total sentence of 3 months imprisonment. In 1996, he was also involved in unrelated traffic antecedents.

## Submissions on sentence by Prosecution

95     The Prosecution submitted for a global sentence of 9 months imprisonment based on the large amount of money involved and also the existing precedents. It was submitted that an individual sentence of 6 months and 5 months imprisonment should be imposed for the two proceeded charges. The Prosecution also submitted that the court could take reference from the sentence of 9 months imprisonment that had been imposed on Dorasamy who had pleaded guilty to a single charge under s. 411 (1) of the Penal Code for dishonestly receiving $50,000 of stolen moneys _knowing_ that the sum represented stolen moneys.

## Mitigation

96     Counsel submitted for a global sentence of 4-5 months imprisonment. It was submitted that since 1996, the accused had kept on the right side of the law. It was only because of the representations made by his brother that he had committed the two offences. It was also submitted that the sentence received by Dorasamy should not be used to calibrate the sentence for the accused, as his culpability was lower than that of Dorasamy. Counsel also submitted that the two sentences of imprisonment should be made to run concurrently.

## Reasons for sentence

97     It was apparent from the respective submissions of both Prosecution and Counsel that they were not very far apart in respect of the individual sentences for each of the two proceeded charges. The Prosecution had submitted that an individual sentence of 6 months and 5 months imprisonment should be imposed for the two proceeded charges. Counsel had submitted instead for 4 – 5 months imprisonment for each of the two proceeded charges. This was not a marked difference. Where the parties differed was in respect of the global sentence – the Prosecution submitted for a global sentence of 9 months imprisonment, while Counsel submitted for 5 months imprisonment in total. Where the Prosecution was prepared to let the court decide if the two sentences should run concurrently or consecutively, Counsel submitted that the two sentences should run concurrently.

98     Counsel had submitted a table of some 7 cases as sentencing precedents. The Prosecution had considered these cases and submitted that a close reading of these cases either:

> a)     supported the Prosecution’s global sentencing position of 9 months’ imprisonment;

> b)     is distinguishable from the present case; or

> c)     is arguably irrelevant for the present case.

99     I was in agreement with the above submission by the Prosecution.

100    In fairness to Counsel, I should add that there was one case which was cited by both Prosecution and Counsel and which the court found to be relevant and instructive to the facts of the present case. This was the case of _PP v Robin Lim Wee Teck <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 236</span>._

101    In the case of _Robin Lim Wee Teck_, the accused had faced a single charge under s. 411(1) of the Penal Code for dishonestly receiving stolen property of $25,991.70 and 5 other charges under s. 41(1)(b) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act. The accused had claimed trial to the 6 proceeded charges. He was convicted after trial. For the s. 411 (1) Penal Code charge, the accused was sentenced to 5 months imprisonment.

102    In the present case, the accused had claimed trial to not one, but two proceeded charges under s. 411(1) of the Penal Code. The total sum involved was more than double the amount involved in the _Robin Lim Wee Teck_ case at $69,000.

103    There was nothing exceptional in the mitigation advanced by Counsel on behalf of her client as regards his personal and family circumstances. At the same time, Counsel had argued that there were no aggravating factors in that this was a one-off offence by the accused, the accused was far removed from the predicate theft offence committed by Sheramu and the accused was also not part of any syndicated operation. I accepted these distinguishing factors. Nonetheless, it is trite that the absence of an aggravating factor is not a mitigating factor.

104    For completeness, I should note that the Prosecution had submitted that the court should take guidance from the sentence of 9 months imprisonment imposed on Dorasamy for a similar charge under s. 411(1) of the Penal Code for dishonestly receiving stolen property of $50,000 _knowing_ that the sum of money was stolen. It was therefore submitted that the parity principle should apply when considering the appropriate sentence for the accused.

105    Counsel disagreed with the Prosecution submission that the parity principle was applicable. The main argument in support of her position was that the culpability of Dorasamy was higher as he had actual knowledge that the moneys were stolen by Sheramu. Further, it could not be said that the accused and Dorasamy had been involved in a “common criminal enterprise” within the scope of the term as it was used by the Court of Appeal in the case of _PP v Ng Sae Kiat <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 167</span>_ or in the case of _Lim Bee Ngan Karen v PP <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1120</span>._

106    In the later case of _Chong Han Rui v PP <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 25</span>_, Menon CJ further expounded on the parity principle and how it was to be applied in the following words –

> _“50_      _Ng Sae Kiat and Karen Lim illustrate the point that the parity principle can and should operate in favour of accused persons if the sentences imposed on them relative to their co-accused persons are sufficiently disparate that it undermines confidence in the administration of justice.  _

> …………………………………………………………………………

> _52_      _I emphasise however that the parity principle is not to be applied in a rigid and inflexible manner._ **_Rather, it is an important aid to the sentencing court to ensure that sentencing of co-offenders is done in a manner that is broadly consistent and fair. But ultimately, what is consistent and fair depends on the facts of the case at hand._** _Thus, in Public Prosecutor v Marzuki bin Ahmad and another appeal _ _<span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 623</span>_, _I declined to apply the principle of parity as between the giver and the receiver in a corruption case, highlighting that the parity principle must yield to the particular circumstances presented (see at \[45\]). Similarly_, **_I make the point here that it is not the law that every co-offender in a common criminal enterprise must be identically charged_** **_or sentenced_**. **_Rather, the court will have to consider all the circumstances of each case before arriving at the appropriate sentence._** _The difficulty with the present case is that it was evident upon considering all the circumstances, that the Appellant had received a sentence which was unduly disparate from B’s sentence, thus offending the parity principle.”_

> (Emphasis added)

107    In my judgment, the accused could not properly be said to be an “accomplice” of Dorasamy as he had not received any stolen moneys from Sheramu together with Dorasamy. I note further that Dorasamy and the accused could not be said to be “co-offenders in a common criminal enterprise” as they had not acted together in any criminal offence, nor had they been jointly charged or even tried together. Under these circumstances, I was therefore doubtful as to whether the parity principle should be applied on these facts as regards the sentence to be imposed on the accused. In any case, as stated by Menon CJ, the parity principle where it applied, was not to be applied in a “rigid and inflexible manner.”

108    As such, I was of the view that even if the accused could arguably be considered to be a co-offender with Dorasamy, it is not the law that every co-offender in a common criminal enterprise must be identically sentenced. Rather, the court will have to consider all the surrounding circumstances of each case before arriving at the appropriate sentence.

109    In this regard, I agreed with Counsel that the culpability of the accused was lower as unlike Dorasamy, he did not have actual knowledge that the moneys he received were stolen moneys. There were also other aspects to consider. The accused faced two proceeded charges and not just one charge as did Dorasamy. The total value of the two charges was $69,000, compared with the $50,000 received by Dorasamy. The accused had claimed trial to his two proceeded charges, while Dorasamy had pleaded guilty. The accused was therefore not entitled to the usual sentencing discount for pleading guilty. I do note however, that the moneys forming the subject matter of both charges have since been recovered, unlike the offender in Robin Lim Wee Teck.

110    Bearing in mind the above considerations, I was of the view that the individual sentences for the two proceeded charges should be five months imprisonment (the charge involving receiving $39,000) and four months imprisonment (the charge involving receiving $30,000) respectively. I note that this is also largely consistent with the case of _Robin Lim Wee Teck_ cited by both the Prosecution and Counsel.

111    I next considered the global sentence and whether the two sentences of imprisonment should be made to run concurrently or consecutively.

112    Both the two proceeded charges took place on two different days and at different times and locations. On both occasions, two different sums of money were received from two different persons. It could not be said therefore that the charges formed part of a single transaction. Further, I am of the view that the culpability of the accused was enhanced by the fact that the second offence was committed within a mere 24 hours. In addition, the total amount involved was a large $69,000. As indicated in _Mohamed Shouffee v PP <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span>_, factors such as proximity in time, proximity of location, proximity of purpose of the offences, continuity of design and unity (or diversity) of the protected interests were useful factors to consider. Ultimately, the consideration had to be one of common sense. There was also the need to consider deterrence and there was also a concomitant need to reflect the overall criminality of the accused’s offending conduct. In this regard, I note that the offender in _Robin Lim Wee Teck_ was sentenced to 5 months imprisonment in respect of the single proceeded s 411 Penal Code charge involving only $25,991.70. In the present case, the accused faced two charges under the same provision, which also involved a far higher total quantum of $69,000. Here, I note in passing that Dorasamy had pleaded guilty and had received 9 months imprisonment for a single charge under s. 411 (1) of the Penal Code involving a sum of $50,000.

113    The accused was accordingly sentenced as follows –

> DAC 921459-2017    - 5 months imprisonment

> DAC 921460-2017    - 4 months imprisonment

114    I also ordered both sentences of imprisonment to run consecutively.

115    All considered, I was of the view that a fair and proportionate sentence would be a global sentence of 9 months imprisonment for the two proceeded charge. I was of the view that this was not a crushing sentence and was also in keeping with the accused’s record and future prospects.

116    The accused has appealed against his conviction and sentence. He is presently on bail pending appeal. I have ordered a stay of execution on the sentence of imprisonment.
