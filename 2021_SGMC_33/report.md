### District Judge Chiah Kok Khun:

## Introduction

1       This is an application for a case management stay. The defendant has applied for a stay of this suit (“MC 7361”) on the ground that there is a significant overlap in the parties and issues in MC 7361 and a High Court Suit HC/S 447/2020 (“HC 447”), thereby giving rise to a risk of inconsistent findings if a stay is not granted. For the reasons set out below, I allow the defendant’s application.

2       The 1st plaintiff in MC 7361 is a former director and shareholder of Dways International Pte Ltd (“the Company”). She is also the 1st defendant in HC 447. The 2nd plaintiff in MC 7361 is a former officer and shareholder of the Company. He is the 2nd defendant in HC 447. The defendant in MC 7361 is the sole director and shareholder of the Company. The 3rd defendant in HC 447 Ms Tang Lee Cheng (“Tang”) and the 4th defendant in HC 447 Mr Chua Hong Chor (“Chua”) are both former distributors of the Company. The plaintiff in HC 447 is the Company.[^1]

3       MC 7361 is essentially a shares sale dispute. The shares sale took place against the backdrop of the departure of the plaintiffs from the Company. In January 2020, the plaintiffs and the defendant discussed the sale of the plaintiffs’ shares in the Company to the defendant. The defendant’s case is that the sum of S$188,750 was agreed as the sum to be paid for the plaintiffs’ shares, at a meeting between the defendant and the 2nd plaintiff on 22 January 2020. The plaintiff’s case on the other hand, is that the amount payable for the plaintiffs’ shares should be S$218,750. The difference of S$30,000 is the subject matter of the plaintiffs’ claim against the defendant in MC 7361.

4       Central to the dispute over the price for the plaintiffs’ shares is a document prepared by the Company’s corporate secretary stating that the defendant would pay a further sum of S$30,000 to the 1st plaintiff. The circumstances leading to the defendant signing this document on 4 February 2020 is a subject matter of contention in MC 7361.

5       The defendant had on 30 January 2020, at the office of the Company’s corporate secretary issued a cheque to the plaintiffs for the sum of S$188,750, which the defendant says was to be the full payment for the plaintiffs’ shares. The cheque was left for safekeeping with the Company’s corporate secretary. The plaintiffs were to hand over the share transfer forms to the Company’s corporate secretary the next day, and hand over the Company’ inventory records, sales records, and accounting documents to the defendant. The plaintiffs did not do so. On 3 February 2020, the defendant instructed the Company’s corporate secretary to release the cheque of S$188,750 to the 2nd plaintiff, before the transfer of the shares was effected. The defendant’s case is that the cheque was released upon the insistence of the 2nd plaintiff, and the defendant had believed at that time it would be the quickest way of effecting a full handover of the business of the Company. The 2nd plaintiff collected the cheque but did not hand over any share transfer forms or accounting documents.

6       On 4 February 2020, the parties met at the office of the Company’s corporate secretary. The defendant contends that the plaintiffs insisted that the defendant signed a document prepared by the Company’s corporate secretary stating that the defendant would pay a further sum of S$30,000 to the 1st plaintiff for the shares. The payment was to be made in ten instalments. The defendant felt that she had no option but to sign the document in order for the plaintiffs to hand over the Company’s inventory records, sales records, and accounts. In other words, the defendant’s case is that she was under duress to sign the document as demanded by the plaintiffs. The defendant says that to date, more than a year since the plaintiffs were supposed to complete the handover, the defendant has still not received a full set of the inventory records, sales records, and accounts of the Company.

7       HC 447 was commenced by the Company on 27 May 2020 against Tang and Chua, and the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs in MC 7361. In HC 447, the Company claimed _inter alia_ that the plaintiffs in MC 7361 had acted in breach of their fiduciary duties as director and officer of the Company by:

> (a)     failing, refusing, and/or neglecting to handover and/or maintain a true and full account of all transactions related to the Company’ bank accounts;

> (b)     failing, refusing, and/or neglecting to handover and/or maintain a true and full account of inventory of the Company’ products;

> (c)     failing, refusing, and/or neglecting to handover and/or maintain a true and full account of the sales record of the Company’ products;

> (d)     misappropriating products and/or revenue from the sales of products; and

> (e)     causing, procuring, and/or authorising payments to be paid out of the Company’ bank accounts in breach of their duties as director and/or officer of the Company.

8       About one month later on 25 June 2020, the defendant commenced an application for a protection order against the 1st plaintiff in DC/PHA 67/2020 (“PHA 67”). The application was made in relation to communications from the 1st plaintiff to the defendant which the defendant held to be harassing in nature.

9       MC 7361 was commenced about three weeks later by the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs against the defendant. The substance of the plaintiffs’ claim in MC 7361 is for the balance sum of S$30,000 to be paid by the defendant to the plaintiffs for the purchase of their shares in the Company.

10     On 26 March 2021 the defendant filed the present application for a case management stay of MC 7361 on the ground that there is a significant overlap in the parties and issues in MC 7361 and HC 447. The defendant is essentially requesting for a temporary stay of MC 7361, pending the determination of related proceedings in HC 447. Trial dates for HC 447 have been fixed for the period from 17 August 2021 to 17 September 2021.

## Legal principles relating to case management stay

11     The defendant relies on the court’s general inherent power as referred to in O 92 r 4 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”) in making this application. The defendant submits that the court’s inherent power includes the power to grant a stay on case management grounds. In this regard, the defendant refers to the Court of Appeal’s decision in _Rex International Holding Ltd and another v Gulf Hibiscus Ltd_ \[2019\] 2 SLR(R) 682 (“_Rex International (CA)_”) which stated at \[16\]:

>     16 … The grant of a stay on case management grounds is part of the court’s exercise of its inherent jurisdiction to manage its own internal processes. It is administrative. …

12     I note that _Rex International (CA)_ is a case which involved overlapping court and arbitration proceedings. It was in that context that the court’s power to grant a case management stay had been exercised.

13     The defendant also refers to the Court of Appeal decision in _Tomolugen Holdings Ltd v Silica Investors Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 1 SLR 373</span> (“_Tomolugen Holdings_”). _Tomolugen Holdings_ discussed the considerations relevant in deciding when a stay of proceedings is warranted. At \[188\], the Court of Appeal alluded to the balancing of three higher-order concerns:

> 188    … The court must in every case aim to strike a balance between three higher-order concerns that may pull in different considerations: first, a plaintiff’s right to choose whom he wants to sue and where; second, the court’s desire to prevent a plaintiff from circumventing the operation of an arbitration clause; and third, the court’s inherent power to manage its processes to prevent an abuse of process and ensure the efficient and fair resolution of disputes. The balance that is struck must ultimately serve the ends of justice. …

14     As seen, the directions set out by the Court of Appeal is in the context of overlapping court and arbitration proceedings. One of the specific concerns expressed by the Court of Appeal is the need to prevent a plaintiff from circumventing the operation of the arbitration clause. The parties in _Tomolugen Holdings_ were essentially facing competing proceedings. They were choosing between litigation and arbitration. The parties differed on which proceedings should take precedence to resolve the dispute between them. It was in that context that the Court of Appeal laid down the three higher-order considerations.

15     The defendant however submits that while the court’s power to grant a case management stay has primarily been exercised where there are overlapping court and arbitration proceedings, the principles governing the grant of a case management stay can be extended to two overlapping court proceedings. In this regard, the defendant refers to _Gulf Hibiscus Ltd v Rex International Holding Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 210</span> (“_Rex International (HC)_”) in contending that the exercise of the Court’s power to grant a case management stay is not predicated on the existence of any arbitration agreement. Aedit Abdullah JC (as he then was) held at \[59\] that the inherent power of the court to stay proceedings can be invoked to deal with situations without an express arbitration agreement between parties. He stated that the jurisprudential basis for the exercise of the power to stay in the absence of an agreement is the wider need to control and manage proceedings between the parties for a fair and efficient administration of justice and is not predicated on holding parties to any agreement. He therefore concluded that the absence of such an agreement is irrelevant, and a stay can be granted in respect of proceedings between parties who are not bound by an arbitration agreement.

16     The defendant also refers to the High Court decision in _Trinity Construction Development Pte Ltd v Sinohydro Corp Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 215</span> (“_Trinity Construction_”) to further her argument. Lee Seiu Kin J concurred at \[42\] with the reasoning of Aedit Abdullah JC (as he then was) in _Rex International (HC)_ that a stay can be granted in respect of proceedings between parties who are not bound by arbitration proceedings. Lee Seiu Kin J applied the reasoning and held that a stay of proceedings can be granted even where there is a possibility an arbitration agreement is non-existent.

17     It is apparent from the foregoing that the common thread in the authorities relied on by the defendant is that they are centred on questions surrounding the parties’ agreement to refer disputes to arbitration. Whilst the court in _Rex International (HC)_ had stated that the court’s power to grant a case management stay is not predicated upon the existence of any arbitration agreement, and in _Trinity Construction_ the court was prepared to grant a stay despite the possibility of the non-existence of an arbitration agreement, both the cases involved a dispute over the existence and validity of an arbitration agreement. The decisions on the question of whether a stay of proceedings should be granted in these cases were made in the shadow of an arbitration clause. There was at least a spectre of the existence of such an agreement between the parties to refer disputes to arbitration. The principles relied on by the court in deciding whether a stay was to be granted were framed in the context of parties having considered arbitration as an alternative to resolve disputes that might arise between them. I will return to the matter of the arbitral context below.

18     Moving on from the question of the court’s power to grant a case management stay, I turn next to the matters to be considered in determining the question of whether a case management stay should be granted. In this regard, the defendant refers to the guidelines discussed in _BNP Paribas Wealth Management v Jacob Agam_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 3 SLR 27</span> (“_BNP Paribas_”) at \[34\]. The defendant submits that the guidelines elucidated are applicable. These guidelines are as follows:

> (a)     which proceeding was commenced first;

> (b)     whether the termination of one proceeding is likely to have a material effect on the other;

> (c)     the public interest;

> (d)     the undesirability of two courts competing to see which of them determines common facts first;

> (e)     consideration of circumstances relating to witnesses;

> (f)     whether work done on pleadings, particulars, discovery, interrogatories and preparation might be wasted;

> (g)     the undesirability of substantial waste of time and effort if it becomes a common practice to bring actions in two courts involving substantially the same issues;

> (h)     how far advanced the proceedings are in each court;

> (i)     the law should strive against permitting multiplicity of proceeding in relation to similar issues: and

> (j)     generally balancing the advantages and disadvantages to each party.

19     The plaintiffs likewise submit that these guidelines are applicable.[^2] The plaintiffs also do not disagree with the defendant that the court has the power to order a case management stay.[^3] The plaintiffs refer to the High Court decision of _Lin Jianwei v Tung Yu-Lien Margaret and another_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 155</span> (“_Lin Jianwei_”). The High Court in _Lin Jianwei_ cited _BNP Paribas_ in setting out the matters to be considered in determining the question of whether a case management stay should be granted. The plaintiffs refer to these guidelines set out in _BNP Paribas_, accepting them to be the guidelines in aid of a court deciding on the question of whether to grant a stay. In so doing, the plaintiffs essentially agree with the defendant as regards the tests to apply in deciding whether a stay is merited. Both parties are pointing to the same case authority in arguing their respective contentions in respect of the application.

20     As seen from the submissions of the parties, in advancing her case for a stay of proceedings, the defendant relies on authorities which involved cases dealing with competing and overlapping court and arbitration proceedings. As noted above, in these cases the decision of the court as regards whether a stay of the court proceedings should be ordered was framed in the context of parties having considered arbitration as an alternative to resolve disputes that might arise between them. Granting a stay of the court proceedings would mean parties proceeding to arbitration to resolve their differences. The consideration for the court is whether the arbitration proceedings should be preferred over the court proceedings.

21     In the present case however, the overlapping proceedings being considered are both court proceedings. The question to be considered is essentially one of preferring one set of court proceedings over another. There is an absence of any arbitral context. In cases dealing with competing and overlapping court and arbitration proceedings, the key operating consideration would be that arbitration is wholly consensual. Parties to an arbitration agreement have essentially entered into an agreement, prior to disputes arising, that they would refer any disputes that might arise to arbitration in preference over litigation. The question that would arise in deciding whether to order a stay of court proceedings is to what extent one party would be allowed to back out of the agreement to refer disputes to arbitration. In my view, there is much to be said for holding parties to their bargain. A party who had agreed to an arbitration clause at the time of entering into a contract should be prevented from avoiding the operation of the arbitration clause. In the face of an arbitration agreement, the reasons for resisting an application to stay court proceedings pending arbitration should be subject to greater scrutiny. The party resisting such an application must be able to offer good reasons to be allowed to sidestep the agreement to refer disputes between the parties to arbitration. The threshold to grant a stay should be set lower in order to prevent the circumvention of the operation of an arbitration clause.

22     In my view, there would therefore be significant differences in matters to be considered in deciding whether a case management stay should be granted in a case involving overlapping court and arbitration proceedings, and in a case involving overlapping court proceedings. When competing and overlapping court and arbitration proceedings are involved, the arbitration agreement looms large in the matters to be considered. It is axiomatic that effect should be given to the intention of parties. The arbitration clause is a manifestation of parties’ intention, and would colour the court’s exercise of its case management powers.

23     I turn next to the case authority referred to by both parties. Both parties rely on the case of _BNP Paribas_ in respect of the applicable factors to look at in determining whether a stay should be granted. In this regard, there is no disagreement that the guidelines enunciated in _BNP Paribas_ are applicable. However, _BNP Paribas_ is a case that involved an overlap between court proceedings in Singapore and proceedings in a foreign court, flowing from the cross-border nature of the dispute in the case. In my view, there would likewise be differences in matters to be considered in deciding whether a case management stay should be granted in a case involving an overlap between court proceedings in Singapore and proceedings in a foreign court, and in a case involving two overlapping court proceedings in Singapore. In a case involving an overlap between court proceedings in Singapore and proceedings in a foreign court, private international law factors such as the principles of _forum non conveniens_ and international comity would have to be considered: see _BNP Paribas_ at \[36\]. Further, in my view in considering whether a case management stay should be granted in a such a case, the question of whether the parallel foreign proceedings were brought for _bona fide_ purposes or were contrived in aid of the stay application would be of greater significance than when considering two overlapping court proceedings in Singapore. The involvement of proceedings under a system different from the Singapore courts inject an element of procedural uncertainty. In particular, in respect of matters of time and costs attendant upon the foreign proceedings, there would be little reference for the court’s guidance. Questions could arise as to whether an application for a stay of proceedings in favour of parallel proceedings in a foreign court is an attempt by the applicant to delay proceedings. In my view therefore, in a case that involves an overlap between court proceedings in Singapore and proceedings in a foreign court, the party applying for a case management stay must be able to offer good reasons why proceedings in a foreign court would be advantageous to the just and expedient disposal of the case. In such a case, the threshold for granting a case management stay should be set higher, in order to ensure efficiency in the resolution and disposal of the disputes between the parties.

24     Returning to the present application before me, it is a case that involves neither an overlap between court proceedings in Singapore and proceedings in a foreign court, nor overlapping court and arbitration proceedings. It involves two overlapping court proceedings before Singapore courts. As discussed in the foregoing, the principles enunciated in the case authorities which involved an arbitration agreement would not be entirely relevant. Likewise, _BNP Paribas_ which involved parallel proceedings in a foreign court would not be of direct assistance. I note that the plaintiffs did refer to one case authority which involved neither arbitration agreements nor competing proceedings in a foreign court. This is the High Court decision in _Lin Jianwei_, a case which concerns two overlapping court proceedings before Singapore courts. However, the High Court in _Lin Jianwei_ applied the factors elucidated in _BNP Paribas_ without commenting on any possible differences in application that could arise as a result of considerations in _BNP Paribas_ that might be relevant only in the context of an overlap between court proceedings in Singapore and proceedings in a foreign court.

25     Following from the foregoing, in my view, in the exercise of the court’s discretion to grant a case management stay, a distinction should be drawn amongst the following contextual scenarios:

> (a)     A case that involves overlapping court and arbitration proceedings.

> (b)     A case that involves an overlap between court proceedings in Singapore and proceedings in a foreign court.

> (c)     A case that involves two overlapping court proceedings before Singapore courts.

26     It is important that we take cognizance of the differences amongst the three analogous scenarios of competing and overlapping proceedings. The approach in each of the scenarios would differ. As discussed, in a case that involves overlapping court and arbitration proceedings, the court’s exercise of its case management powers pivots on the existence of the arbitration clause. In a case that involves an overlap between court proceedings in Singapore and proceedings in a foreign court, the considerations would include the suite of factors relating to private international law. On the other hand, in a case that involves two overlapping court proceedings before Singapore courts, none of these factors would be relevant.

27     I turn now to the question of what factors a court should consider in deciding whether to grant a stay in such a case. In _BNP Paribas_ at \[34\], a list of ten factors, stated to be non-exhaustive, was endorsed (see \[18\] above). These generic factors were first identified by the Federal Court of Australia in _Sterling Pharmaceuticals Pty Limited v The Boots Company (Australia) Pty Limited_ (1992) 34 FCR 287 (“_Sterling Pharmaceuticals_”). It should be noted that _Sterling Pharmaceuticals_ is a case that involved an overlap between court proceedings in Australia and a foreign jurisdiction, in that instance, New Zealand. The factors enumerated by the court are wide ranging in nature. In my view, these disparate factors can be curated and adapted for application in a case involving two overlapping court proceedings within the same jurisdiction. They can be broadly distilled into three matters that should be considered in deciding whether to grant a stay in a case that involves two overlapping court proceedings before Singapore courts. The three matters for consideration would be as follows:

> (a)     The extent of overlap in the issues, parties and witnesses in the two proceedings.

> (b)     The risk of inconsistent findings as a result of the overlap in the two proceedings.

> (c)     The prejudice that may result to the one party or the other if a stay is granted.

28     The above factors flow from the overarching consideration of the need to ensure the efficient and fair resolution of the dispute as a whole. Shorn of extraneous considerations attendant in the other two scenarios, in a case involving two court proceedings in Singapore, the key considerations would be multiplicity of proceedings and the risk of inconsistent findings resulting from any overlap in the two proceedings. Beyond these, practical considerations should dictate which of the proceedings should progress first to ensure efficiency and fairness.

## Issues to be determined

29     Following on from the above, the key issues to be determined in the present application are:

> (a)     whether there is an overlap of the issues, parties and witnesses between MC 7361 and HC 447;

> (b)     if so, whether there is a risk of inconsistent findings as a result of the overlap in the two proceedings; and

> (c)     if there is any prejudice that may result to the one party or the other if a stay is granted.

## Analysis and findings

### Overlap between the proceedings in MC 7361 and HC 447

30     I turn first to the question of the extent of overlap in the issues, parties and witnesses in the two proceedings. I note first that the two plaintiffs in MC 7361 are the 1st and 2nd defendants respectively in HC 447. There is an overlap in the parties in the two proceedings. They are also giving evidence in both proceedings. As for the issues relevant in the proceedings, the defendant points to the plaintiffs’ notices of objections to the contents of the defendant’s and the defendant’s witnesses’ affidavits of evidence-in-chief (“AEICs”). In these notices, the plaintiffs have raised objections that the matters referred to in the AEICs relate to issues and facts to be decided in HC 447. I note that substantial portions of the AEICs of the defendant and her three witnesses were objected to by the plaintiffs on this basis.[^4]

31     At the outset therefore, the AEICs and the notices of objections filed by parties indicate that the issues for determination in MC 7361 and HC 447 would overlap. It would appear that contrary to the contentions raised in opposing this application, the plaintiffs themselves are of the view that there are overlapping issues by virtue of the nature of their notices of objection to the AEICs filed on the defendant’s behalf.

32     To examine further the question of overlapping issues, I turn first to the issues to be determined in MC 7361. The issues to be tried have in fact been agreed to by the parties and the list of issues has been settled in the course of the case management conferences held for MC 7361. The list of issues is as follows:[^5]

> (a)     Whether there was an oral agreement between the plaintiffs and the defendant that the purchase price of the plaintiffs’ shares in the Company be S$188,750 or whether the oral agreement was for the purchase price to be S$218,750.

> (b)     If the finding in relation to (a) above is that there was an oral agreement between the plaintiffs and the defendant that the purchase price of the plaintiffs’ shares in the Company be S$188,750, whether the document disclosed at s/no 1 of the plaintiffs’ list of Documents dated 15 July 2020 constitutes a variation of the oral agreement.

> (c)     If the finding in relation to (b) above is yes, whether the variation of the oral agreement by the document disclosed at s/no 1 of the plaintiffs’ list of documents dated 15 July 2020 is supported by consideration.

> (d)     Whether the document disclosed at s/no 1 of the plaintiffs’ list of documents dated 15 July 2020 was signed under duress.

33     The first issue above concerns the consideration agreed upon for the defendant’s purchase of the plaintiffs’ shares in the Company. The defendant takes the position that the purchase price was S$188,750. The plaintiffs take the position that the purchase price was S$218,750. There is a S$30,000 difference between the plaintiffs’ and defendant’s position on the purchase price of the shares. On the basis of the position they take on the purchase price, the plaintiffs make claim for the sum of S$30,000 in MC 7361.

34     One of the defendant’s contentions in support of her position is that a loan of S$30,000 from the Company’s account was made by the plaintiffs to Ms Tang and Mr Chua without authorization. The defendant therefore says that Ms Tang and Mr Chua owed the Company the sum of S$30,000. The plaintiffs however contend that the sum of S$30,000 owed to the Company by Ms Tang and Mr Chua had been written off by the Company. The plaintiff’s case is that therefore the defendant ought to pay the plaintiffs this sum of S$30,000 and the purchase price for their shares ought to be S$218,750. The question of whether the plaintiffs made an unauthorised loan of S$30,000 is thus central to the dispute in MC 7316. In this regard, I note that the question of whether the sum of S$30,000 was an unauthorised loan made to Ms Tang and Mr Chua, and which was unaccounted for, is also an issue in HC 447. Likewise, the question of whether the sum of S$30,000 had in fact been written off by the Company will also be answered in HC 447.

35     It follows that the court’s decision in HC 447 on whether there was an unauthorised loan of S$30,000 will impact the plaintiffs’ position taken in MC 7361 that the purchase price for their shares in the Company was S$218,750. If the finding in HC 447 is that there was an unauthorised loan of S$30,000 by the plaintiffs to Ms Tang and Mr Chua, then the plaintiffs’ basis for the increase in purchase price by S$30,000 for the shares would be undermined. The determination in HC 447 of this issue would therefore have a bearing on the plaintiff’s narrative in MC 7361 of how the purchase price was derived. In this regard, I am unable to agree with the plaintiffs’ submissions that the nature of the sum of S$30,000 has no relevance to the dispute.[^6]

36     The disputes surrounding the sum of S$30,000 is central to MC 7361, as MC 7361 is the plaintiff’s claim for S$30,000. As related questions concerning the sum of S$30,000 will be determined in HC 447, there is an undeniable overlap in this key issue in the two proceedings. It should be noted that the plaintiffs themselves have in their AEICs made reference to HC 447 when setting out their case on the issue of the sum of S$30,000.[^7]

37     I turn next to the fourth issue in the agreed list of issues in MC 7361. This is the issue of whether the document disclosed at s/no 1 of the plaintiffs’ list of documents dated 15 July 2020 was signed under duress. The document is the agreement dated 5 February 2020 between the plaintiffs and the defendant regarding payment for the plaintiffs’ shares in the company. It stated that the defendant would pay a further sum of S$30,000 to the 1st plaintiff for the shares. As alluded to above, the defendant’s case is that the document was signed under duress. At the time when the document was signed, the plaintiffs were withholding the Company’s inventory records, sales records, and accounts. The handover of these records to the defendant was important because the plaintiffs had charge of the day-to-day operation of the Company. The defendant did not have the records and documents necessary to carry on with the Company’s business after the departure of the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs from the Company. The defendant therefore felt that she had no choice but to sign the document dated 5 February 2020 in order to obtain those records.[^8] The plaintiffs on the other hand, contend that the defendant had informed them that the defendant had conducted an inventory check and all was in order.[^9]

38     At the same time, in HC 447 the Company has made claims that the plaintiffs have failed to hand over a full account of all transactions related to the Company’s bank accounts and a full inventory of the Company’ products. The court in HC 447 would therefore have to determine the issue of whether the plaintiffs unreasonably withheld inventory records, sales records, and accounts from the defendant in breach of their duties to the Company. In doing so, the court will have to make a finding whether the plaintiffs provided a reasonably complete handover of those records of the Company at the material time. This finding will in turn impact the adjudication of the parties’ conflicting contentions in MC 7361 in respect of the document dated 5 February 2020. The court in MC 7361 has to decide on the defendant’s contention of the pressure she was under when she signed the document dated 5 February 2020, and whether such pressure exerted on the defendant was illegitimate. As the issue of whether the agreement dated 5 February 2020 was signed under duress pivots on the adjudication of the parties’ differing versions in respect of the inventory records, sales records, and accounts, there is clearly an overlap of issue in the two proceedings.

39     In my view, it follows from the foregoing that there is an undisputable overlap of key issues in the two proceedings.

### Risk of inconsistent findings as a result of the overlap in the two proceedings

40     I turn to the question of whether there is a risk of inconsistent findings in view of the overlap in issues in the two proceedings.

41     In regard to the issue in respect of the sum of S$30,000, the court will determine in HC 447 whether the sum comprised a loan that had been written off by the Company, and whether the Company made an unauthorised loan of the sum from the Company’s bank accounts to Ms Tang and Mr Chua. As discussed above, the decision in HC 447 in regard to whether the S$30,000 is an unauthorised loan is connected to the plaintiffs’ case of how the purchase price was derived. If the court in HC 447 finds that it was an unauthorized loan, it will have a direct impact on the central question in MC 7316 of whether the agreed purchase price for the plaintiffs’ shares in the Company was S$188,750 or S$218,750. There is therefore a risk of inconsistent findings over the sum of S$30,000 in the two proceedings.

42     As for the issue in respect of whether the agreement dated 5 February 2020 was signed under duress, I noted above that the court in HC 447 will have to make a determination as to whether the plaintiffs unreasonably withheld inventory records, sales records, and accounts from the defendant. On the other hand, the court in MC 7361 has to make a finding in respect of the defendant’s contention that she had signed the document dated 5 February 2020 in order to obtain those same records of the Company. In other words, the defendant’s case is that the plaintiffs wrongfully withheld those documents. This contention is a mirror image of the Company’s claim against the plaintiffs in HC 447 that they failed to provide a proper handover of the Company’s inventory records, sales records, and accounts to the defendant. Plainly, there exists a risk of inconsistent findings in this regard by the court in the two proceedings.

43     In the premises of the above, I find that the overlap in factual issues between MC 7361 and HC 447 gives rise to a real risk of inconsistent findings between the two sets of proceedings.

### No prejudice to parties if a stay is granted

44     In my view, there is no real prejudice if a stay is granted. The case management stay sought by the defendant is limited; it is for a stay of proceedings in MC 7361 until resolution of the proceedings in HC 447. In this regard, I note that trial dates for HC 447 have been set aside for the period from 17 August 2021 to 17 September 2021. With timelines for the trial in HC 447 in place, there can be no argument of undue delay that may be caused to the progress of MC 7361.

45     Besides contending that there is no overlap in issues between the two suits, the plaintiffs also raised the objection that the defendant is not _bona fide_ in making the application for a case management stay_.[^10]_ For completeness, I turn to this contention.

46     In making this objection, the plaintiffs refer first to the delay in the defendant making the application; and second, to the failure of the defendant to apply to stay the POHA application in PHA 67.

47     In respect to the question of delay, the plaintiffs say the defendant would have been aware of the issues that would overlap at the outset. In this regard, I note that delay in making the application in itself cannot be a reason not to order a stay. In any event, I do not see any real delay in the present case. The overlapping issues became apparent to the defendant when the plaintiffs filed their objections to AEICs. It was therefore only at the AEICs stage that it became clear that a stay might be in order. It is held in _Rex International (CA)_ (\[11\] _supra_) at \[11\] that until a real risk of overlapping issues arise, it may be premature to consider and grant a case management stay. If the defendant had made this application earlier, she could well have been met with the contention that her application was premature.

48     In regard to PH 67, the plaintiffs say that the defendant’s inaction in relation to PH 67 shows a lack of _bona fides_. In my view, the nature of a POHA application, and the remedies sought in a POHA application are very different matters from a civil action. The application was made in relation to communications from the 1st plaintiff to the defendant which the defendant thought to be harassing in nature. There are no real overlapping issues in the two proceedings. I do not see the defendant in not asking for a stay of PH 67; but for a stay of MC 7361 shows a lack of _bona fides_. They are two different matters.

## Conclusion

49     In conclusion, I find that there is a substantial overlap in the two sets of proceedings so as to warrant a stay of MC 7361 given that:

> (a)     the parties to MC 7361 overlap with the parties to HC 447;

> (b)     the issues in HC 447 have a bearing on at least two out of four of the issues in MC 7361; and

> (c)     any decision rendered in respect of MC 7361 would have an impact on the reliefs sought in HC 447, thus engendering a risk of inconsistent findings if a stay is not granted.

50     I also find that there will be little or no prejudice occasioned to the plaintiffs given that the case management stay sought is limited. It is a stay until the full and final resolution of the proceedings in HC 447. I therefore allow the application. Parties are to write in with their submissions on the costs of the application, limited to five pages each, within 14 days of the date of this judgment.
