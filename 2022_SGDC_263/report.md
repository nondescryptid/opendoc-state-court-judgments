### District Judge James Elisha Lee:

## Introduction

1       The accused Mohamed Faizel Ahmed (“the Accused”), a 47-year-old Singapore Permanent Resident, claimed trial to 4 charges under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Chapter 185, Revised Edition 2008) (“the MDA”). These comprises 2 charges for consumption of a controlled drug under s 8(b)(i) of the MDA, 1 charge of possession of a controlled drug under s 8(a) of the MDA and 1 charge of possession of an utensil intended for consumption of a controlled drug under s 9 of the MDA. The charges are set out below:

> **DAC-902247-2021 (1st Charge)**

> are charged that you, on or before 10 November 2020, in Singapore, did consume a Controlled Drug listed in The First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Chapter 185, 2008 Rev Ed), to wit, 2-\[1-(4-Fluorobutyl)-1Hindazole-3-carboxamido\]-3,3-dimethylbutanoic acid or its hexanoic acid isomer or any of their respective fluoro positional isomers in the butyl group, without any authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made there under and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 8(b)(i) and punishable under Section 33(3A) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Chapter 185, 2008 Rev Ed).

## Undisputed Facts

2       An agreed statement of facts (“ASOF”) was tendered under s 267(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Chapter 68, Revised Edition 2012) (“the CPC”). The agreed and undisputed facts are as follows.

3       On 10 November 2020, at about 10.10 pm, the Accused was arrested by police officers at Woodlands MRT Station at 30 Woodlands Avenue 2, Singapore 738343. At the said location, police officers searched the Accused and seized from his possession one packet of vegetable matter (“FA-A”) and one packet of tobacco rolling paper (“FA-B”). The Accused was subsequently escorted to Woodlands Police Divisional Headquarters for further investigations.

4       On 11 November 2020, at Woodlands Police Divisional Headquarters, the Accused provided two bottles of his urine samples which were sealed and marked in his presence. The Accused’s urine samples were sent on the same day to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis.

5       The urine samples were analysed respectively by 2 analysts with the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of the HSA, namely PW7 Ng Chee Ann and PW 15 Goh Mei Ling Evelyn, and were found to contain the following:

> (a)     2-\[1-(4-Fluorobutyl)-1H-indazole-3-carboxamido\]-3,3-dimethylbutanoic acid or its hexanoic acid isomer or any of their respective fluoro positional isomers in the butyl group; and

> (b)     2-\[1-(Pent-4-en-1-yl)-1H-indazole-3-carboxamido\]-3,3-dimethylbutanoic acid or its hexanoic acid isomer or any of their respective pentenyl positional isomers in the pentyl group.

6       2-\[1-(4-Fluorobutyl)-1H-indazole-3-carboxamido\]-3,3-dimethylbutanoic acid or its hexanoic acid isomer or any of their respective fluoro positional isomers in the butyl group and 2-\[1-(Pent-4-en-1-yl)-1H-indazole-3-carboxamido\]-3,3-dimethylbutanoic acid or its hexanoic acid isomer or any of their respective pentenyl positional isomers in the pentyl group are Class A controlled Drugs listed in The First Schedule to the MDA.

7       The Accused is not authorized under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to consume the said controlled drugs, or to have in his possession any exhibit which is used in connection with the smoking of a controlled drug.

## Overview of The Parties’ Cases

### The Prosecution’s case

8       The Prosecution’s case in respect of the 1st and 2nd charges (“the Consumption Charges”) is based on the presumption under s 22 of the MDA. The Accused’s urine samples had tested positive for the respective controlled drugs in the Consumption Charges, and no dispute has been raised concerning the collection, chain of custody, and testing of the Accused’s urine samples and analysis of the test results. The presumption under s 22 of the MDA is thereby invoked. The Prosecution’s case is that the Accused has failed to rebut the presumption.

9       In respect of the 3rd charge (“the Possession Charge”), the Prosecution’s case is based on the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA. The Accused was found in physical possession of FA-A which was subsequently analysed and found to contain the controlled drug MDMB-4en-PINACA (“PINACA”). There was no dispute or issue raised concerning the chain of custody and testing of FA-A and analysis of the test result. The Accused is thereby presumed under s 18(2) of the MDA to have known the nature of the controlled drug until the contrary is proven. The Prosecution’s case is similarly that the Accused has failed to rebut the presumption.

10     As for the 4th charge (hereinafter referred to as “the Utensil Charge”), the Prosecution’s position is that the circumstantial evidence as well as the unrebutted presumption of knowledge on the part of the Accused of the nature of the controlled drug in respect of the 3rd charge clearly points to the Accused intending to use FA-B to consume the illegal drug in FA-A.

### The Defence’s case

11     The Accused’s defence in respect of the Consumption Charges is that he was not aware that he had consumed anything which contained illegal or controlled drugs. The Accused claimed that on the day of his arrest, sometime in the evening, he was at Block 834 Woodlands Street 83 (“Blk 834”) and a group of 4 individuals (“Group of 4”) had offered him hand-rolled cigarettes which he had taken some puffs from and returned the cigarettes to the group. According to the Accused, he had assumed that the hand-rolled cigarettes were made from “Butterfly” brand tobacco which he had assisted the Group of 4 to purchase earlier at a minimart at Blk 832 Woodlands. The Accused believed the controlled drug found in his urine samples to be a result of having smoked the hand-rolled cigarettes offered to him by the Group of 4.

12     The Accused’s defence in relation to the Possession Charge and Utensil Charge is that while he was found in physical possession of FA-A and FA-B, he was not aware that FA-A contained PINACA. The Accused claimed that FA-A and FA-B were given to him by the Group of 4 as he was leaving the void deck of Blk 834. He had no knowledge of the presence of a controlled drug in FA-A and had believed that FA-A was just normal tobacco.

## Summary and Assessment of Evidence

### Assessment of the Evidence Adduced by the Prosecution

13     The Prosecution adduced evidence from 17 witnesses. They comprise the following groups:

> i)     the enforcement officers involved in the initial detention and subsequent arrest of the Accused;

> ii)     the officers who were involved in the collection of the Accused’s urine samples, conduct of the preliminary urine test and conveyance of the accused’s urine samples to HSA for analysis;

> iii)     the officers involved in the custody and conveyance of the vegetable matter seized from the accused to HSA;

> iv)     the respective HSA analysts who analysed and interpreted the results the tests conducted at HSA on the urine samples and the vegetable matter seized from the accused;

> v)     the officers, including the investigating officer, who recorded statements from the Accused.

14     PW1 SGT Mervin Liaw testified that at the material time, he was conducting foot patrol around Woodlands MRT Station together with 3 other officers when he saw the Accused at the bicycle bay. After observing him for about 1 minute, the team then approached the Accused. PW1 and PW8 then proceeded to have a conversation with him. According to both PW1 and PW8, the Accused’s speech was slurred. The Accused also appeared nervous to him, although PW1 conceded that in his experience as a foot patrol officer, it was not uncommon for individuals to be a bit nervous when approached by police officers. PW1 then asked to check the Accused’s bag, which the Accused agreed, and found FA-A inside. Both PW1 and PW8 gave evidence that FA-A had a strong and pungent smell. According to PW1, PW8, who was a smoker had told him that FA-A did not smell like ordinary tobacco and that it might have been spiked. PW8 also described the smell as a chemical smell like a freshly painted room. They then proceeded to detain the Accused and brought him to the First Aid Room at Woodlands MRT Station. Thereat, a further search was conducted, and FA-B was found in the Accused’s bag. According to both PW1 and PW8, the Accused was co-operative throughout.

15     PW1 then reported the matter to his supervisor. The Accused was subsequently placed under arrest and escorted to Woodlands Police Divisional Headquarters where he was placed in the lock-up. The arresting officer PW3 SGT Muhamad Hazwan gave evidence that the Accused did not resist arrest and was co-operative. The evidence of the officers involved in the detention and arrest of the Accused were not challenged in any material aspect.

16     The Accused’s urine samples were procured at Woodlands Police Divisional Headquarters and an Instant Urine Test (“IUT”) conducted on 1 of the samples. There were no issues raised by the Accused concerning the procurement and chain of custody of the urine samples, as well as the conduct of the IUT. 2 other samples were sent to HSA for analysis. PW 7 and PW15, the analysts who conducted the analysis on the respective urine samples both testified that the test results were consistent with the consumption of 4-fluoro-MDMB-BINACA and PINACA. There were no issues raised by the Accused concerning the analysis of the urine samples as well.

17     The exhibit FA-A was sent to HSA for analysis. PW17 Kwang Jia Yi, the HSA analyst who conducted the analysis issued a certificate stating that the exhibit contained 7.49 grams of fragmented vegetable matter and PINACA was detected in it. PW17 further testified that one explanation for the presence of PINACA on the vegetable matter is that the drug can be dissolved in an organic solvent and the vegetable matter soaked in the solution, or the solution is sprayed onto the vegetable matter. The Accused similarly did not raise any issue concerning the chain of custody and analysis of the exhibit FA-A.

18     A total of 4 statements were recorded from the Accused. None were adduced in evidence by parties. The first statement was recorded by PW6 Leong Li An on 11 November 2020, shortly after the Accused’s arrest. The remaining 3 statements were recorded by PW16 SI Mohamed Fauzi, who was the Investigation Officer, on 8 December 2020, 15 December 2020 and 17 June 2021 respectively.

19     According to PW16, the Accused had informed in the statements that he had purchased the “Butterfly” brand tobacco from a minimart. The correct location of the minimart was only given by the Accused in the statement recorded in June 2021. Following that, PW16 conducted a test buy of a packet of “Butterfly” brand tobacco from the said minimart and sent it for analysis at HSA. No controlled drugs were detected in the packet purchased by PW16.

20     Both PW6 and PW16 were not questioned during cross-examination on any aspect in relation to the Group of 4, which was the cruz of the defence which is set out in paragraphs 23 and 24 below.

### Assessment of the Evidence Adduced by the Defence

21     The Accused’s evidence comprises only his own testimony. He did not call any other witness or adduce any other evidence to support his case.

22     The Accused testified that he was at Woodlands on 10 November 2020 to visit an elderly uncle, a passenger he had met sometime in mid-October 2020 while he was working as a Grab driver. The elderly uncle had offered to refer him a job after the Accused had told him about his financial struggles as a driver. According to the Accused, after their first meeting in mid-October 2020, he had visited the elderly uncle on numerous occasions at Blk 832 Woodlands Street 83 (“Blk 832”), which was the block the elderly uncle had told the Accused he was residing at[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1).

23     The Accused gave evidence that on 10 November 2020, he was at Blk 832 at about 4.30pm or 4.45pm to meet the elderly uncle. When they met, the elderly uncle had asked the Accused to help him purchase 4D tickets. The Group of 4, who, according to the Accused, were the elderly uncle’s neighbourhood friends, were present at the time. They too had asked the Accused to help them purchase 4D tickets. After purchasing the 4D tickets and handing them to the elderly uncle and the Group of 4, the Accused then sat at the parapet of Blk 834 to wait for the elderly uncle[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2). After sitting there for about half an hour, the Group of 4, who were sitting nearby, then invited the Accused to join them, which the Accused did. After about 10 minutes, they asked the Accused to help them purchase “Butterfly” brand tobacco. The Accused agreed to do so and purchased 5 packets of “Butterfly” brand tobacco from a minimart at Blk 832 and handed them over to the Group of 4[^3].

24     After that, the Accused decided to go to the coffeeshop to perform ablution for his prayers. After his prayers, the Accused again sat at the parapet of Blk 834 to drink his coffee. The Group of 4 then invited him to join them again. He was offered a rolled cigarette by one of them. According to the Accused, he had seen them rolled the cigarette by hand using the “Butterfly” brand tobacco he had helped them purchase earlier. The Accused took one or two puffs from the rolled cigarette as he did not want to disrespect them[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4). He left the group thereafter and went to Blk 832 to see the elderly uncle regarding the job the elderly uncle had supposedly promised him. The elderly uncle then referred the Accused to a food shop at Woodlands MRT Station which required someone to work for them. As the Accused was leaving the place for Woodlands MRT Station, the Group of 4 again invited him to join them and offered him another rolled cigarette. The Accused took two puffs this time. The Group of 4 also gave him FA-A and FA-B[^5]. The Accused then left the place for Woodlands MRT Station where he was subsequently detained and arrested.

25     It is undisputed that the Accused had made no mention of the Group of 4 and their involvement in any of the 4 statements recorded from him. This is most curious given that the key plank of his defence is that he had smoked the rolled cigarettes offered, as well as given FA-A and FA-B by them. When questioned by counsel why, the Accused’s reply was that he was not asked specifically how FA-A and FA-B were given to him by PW6[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6). This was despite the Accused’s evidence that he had been told by the officers who arrested him that he is suspected of having controlled drugs in his possession[^7]. As for PW16, the Accused claimed that he was merely asked where he had obtained FA-A and FA-B from, and he responded accordingly that he had purchased it from a minimart. According to the Accused, PW16 had informed him during the recording of the statement that FA-A was found to contain controlled drugs[^8]. During cross-examination, the Accused further claimed that he was not given the opportunity to tell the officers about the Group of 4 because they had not asked him about them. He did not provide any other explanation for not mentioning the Group of 4 during the recording of his statements during cross-examination and re-examination despite being asked by both the Prosecution and his counsel respectively.

26     After the conclusion of re-examination, the Accused requested to address the court directly. The Prosecution did not object and I granted the request on condition that the Prosecution may further cross-examine the Accused. It was only during the address that the Accused first informed that he had not mentioned the Group of 4 in his statements as he was afraid that they would “do something” to him and that he was “afraid for \[his\] own life”[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9). When queried by counsel during further re-examination (following further cross-examination by the prosecution) why he felt afraid for his own life, the Accused was, however, unable to provide any cogent reason or explanation[^10].

## Analysis

### The law pertaining to the Consumption Charges

#### Section 8(b)(i) and 22 of the MDA

27     S 8(b)(i) of the MDA provides:

> 8.    Except as authorised by this Act, it shall be an offence for a person to —

>> …

>> (b)    smoke, administer to himself or herself or otherwise consume —

>>> (i)    a controlled drug, other than a specified drug;

28     Section 22 of the MDA provides:

> 22.    If any controlled drug is found in the urine of a person as a result of both urine tests conducted under section 31(4)(b), he or she is presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have consumed that controlled drug in contravention of section 8(b).

29     In _Cheng Siah Johnson v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 SLR(R) 839</span> at \[15\], CJ Yong Pung How held,

> “…the statutory presumption in s 22 was twofold in that proof of the primary fact by the Prosecution, ie a controlled drug was found in the urine as a result of both urine tests in s 31, triggered the actus reus of consumption and the _mens rea_ required for the offence. The burden of proof hence fell upon the Defence who would have to disprove either element on a balance of probabilities. It was insufficient if the appellant merely raised a reasonable doubt.”

### Whether the presumption under s 22 of the MDA has been invoked

30     The Accused’s urine samples had tested positive for the consumption of 4-fluoro-MDMB-BINACA and PINACA. There were no issues concerning the procurement, chain of custody and analysis of the urine samples. In the circumstances, I am of the view that the presumption under s 22 of the MDA has been successfully invoked. The burden now falls on the Accused to rebut, on a balance of probabilities, the presumption.

### Whether the Accused has rebutted the presumption under section 22 of the MDA

31     The Accused’s defence is a bare assertion on his part. He has not called any other witness or adduced any evidence to support his case.

32     The more significant issue concerning the Accused’s defence, however, is that he had not disclosed the material facts surrounding his defence in any of the statements recorded from him during investigations. This raises the question of whether any adverse inference may be drawn against the Accused arising from his non-disclosure.

#### Whether any adverse inference may be drawn against the Accused based on his non-disclosure of material facts and circumstances pertaining to his defence in his statements recorded during investigations

33     Section 22(2) of the CPC allows the Accused to withhold mentioning any fact or circumstance in his long statement(s) which, if disclosed, may incriminate him. As such, no adverse inference in general may be drawn against him for failing to disclose such fact or circumstance in his long statement(s).

> 22.—(2)    The person examined is bound to state truly what the person knows of the facts and circumstances of the case, except that the person need not say anything that might expose the person to a criminal charge, penalty or forfeiture.

34     This does not mean, however, that the court may never draw any inferences arising from the non-disclosure. In _Kwek Seow Hock v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 3 SLR 157</span> at \[19\] the Court of Appeal (“CA”) held (in the context of the old provision under section 121 of the CPC),

> “If, however, the fact or circumstance that is withheld will exculpate the accused from an offence, a court may justifiably infer that it is an afterthought and untrue, unless the court is persuaded that there are good reasons for the omission to mention that exculpatory fact or circumstance. This accords with common sense – if an accused believes he is not guilty of an offence that he might be charged with, he would be expected to disclose why he has such a belief.”

35     I am of the view that the Accused’s account involving the Group of 4, if proven, would exculpate the Accused from all the charges. He made no mention, however, of the Group of 4 and their involvement in any of the 4 statements recorded from him. I am of the view that the Accused has failed to provide any good reasons for his failure to do so.

36     The Accused’s explanation that he had not disclosed the involvement of the Group of 4 during the recording of the statements as he was not specifically asked by the I.O. how and from whom he had obtained FA-A is preposterous. It would also not have been possible for the I.O. to go into any greater degree of specificity in the questions posed given the circumstances. For example, it would not have been possible for the I.O. to have asked the Accused from whom he had obtained FA-A from unless he had information, whether from the Accused or otherwise, in the first place that someone had given FA-A to the Accused. According to the Accused himself, he had been told as early as from the point of his arrest that he was suspected of having controlled drugs in his possession[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11). It beggars belief that in the face of potential serious charges for consumption and possession of a controlled drug, the Accused had not thought it relevant, necessary, or even critical to disclose the key plank of his defence, whether he had been specifically asked or not. The Accused’s reticence is even more bewildering given the 7-month period between his arrest and the recording of the 4th statement, which would have provided ample time and opportunity for him to do so.

37     Counsel had submitted that as the questions posed to the Accused during investigations had been centred on where the Accused had purchased FA-A from, that had been the only aspect in the Accused’s mind, and that was why the Accused only told the I.O. that he had purchased it from a mini-mart. In the Accused’s mind, there was no suspicion about the Group of 4. This submission, in my view is contrived and does not accord with normal human instincts and behaviour. Upon being detained and arrested by the police, the natural response would have been for the Accused, or any reasonable person, to make full disclosure of how he had obtained FA-A and FA-B to absolve himself. This is especially when the Accused had testified that he felt “very nervous” and was “a bit shaken” when he was detained and that he “became extremely nervous and got very scared and started crying” when he was handcuffed and placed in the car[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12). Given the state the Accused was in, one would have expected him to inform, in the first opportunity he has, the police that he was given FA-A and FA-B by the Group of 4 and that they had also offered him roll cigarettes to smoke earlier.

38     The Accused’s failure to do so can only be explained by one of 2 possible scenarios. The first is that he had intentionally withheld the relevant information, in which case his reason(s) for doing so would be pertinent. The second would be that there was simply nothing to disclose, i.e. the involvement of the Group of 4 was pure fiction.

39     The Accused did not furnish any reason for withholding the information regarding the Group of 4 during investigations throughout his evidence-in-chief, cross-examination and re-examination. It was only after that, when the Accused had requested for, and I had permitted on condition that he may be subjected to further cross-examination, to address the court that he first revealed that he was afraid the Group of 4 would “do something” to him and that he was “afraid for \[his\] own life”. When probed further by counsel for the reasons, the Accused was unable to provide any cogent explanation or further elaboration. The Accused has also not explained why he is now prepared to make full disclosure of the information regarding the Group of 4.

40     Notably, the Accused has testified that he did not have the time to locate the Group of 4 between November and December 2020 as he had to work[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13). The logical inference therefore would be that he had not had any contact with the Group of 4 since his arrest. It is difficult, as such, to comprehend the Accused’s basis for being afraid that the Group of 4 would do anything to him.

41     In the circumstances, I am of the view that the Accused’s failure to disclose the involvement of the Group of 4 from the point of his arrest and throughout investigations, specifically the recording of the 4 statements, cannot be attributed to any intention on the part of the Accused to withhold the information. This leaves the second possibility, which is that the involvement of the Group of 4 is entirely fictitious.

42     I am therefore of the view that it would be appropriate to draw an adverse inference against the Accused’s non-disclosure of material aspects of his defence in his statements during investigations. I find, as such, that the Accused’s defence that he had smoked hand-rolled cigarettes offered to him and been given FA-A and FA-B by the Group of 4 and that he was not aware that the hand-rolled cigarettes and FA-B contained controlled drugs is a complete fabrication and an afterthought.

43     Counsel has further argued that the fact that the Accused had not fled when he saw the police officers approach him and was co-operative, is corroborative of his defence that he neither knew that FA-A contained a controlled drug nor that he had consumed any controlled drug. I am of the view that the Accused’s reaction in the circumstances is, at best, inconclusive. The Accused’s conduct would be entirely consistent as well with the Accused realising that any attempt at fleeing would have been futile given that there were 4 police officers approaching him at the time. Any resistance or non-cooperation on his part would also lead to his immediate apprehension.

44     All considered, I am of the view that the Accused has not met the burden of proof required of him, namely that of a balance of probabilities, to rebut the presumption under s 22 of the MDA.

45     In the circumstances, I find that the Accused has failed to rebut the presumption under s 22 of the MDA in respect of the Consumption Charges and the Consumptions Charges are therefore made out against the Accused.

### The law pertaining to the Possession Charge

_Section 8(a) and 18 of the MDA_

46     Section 8(a) of the MDA provides:

> 8.    Except as authorised by this Act, it shall be an offence for a person to —

>> (a)    have in his or her possession a controlled drug;

47     S 18(1)(a) and (2) of the MDA provides:

> 18.—(1)    Any person who is proved to have had in his or her possession or custody or under his or her control —

>> (a)    anything containing a controlled drug;

>> …

>> is presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have had that drug in his or her possession.

> (2)    Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his or her possession is presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have known the nature of that drug.

48     Possession in the context of the MDA refers to both physical possession or custody, and knowledge (_Sim Teck Ho v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 2 SLR(R) 959</span> at \[11\]). To establish the element of physical possession, the Prosecution is only required to prove that the accused person knew of the existence in his possession, custody or control, of the item which turns out to be drugs. It is not necessary for the Prosecution to also prove that the accused knew the precise nature of the drug at this stage.

49     In _Adili Chibuike Ejike v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 2 SLR 254</span>, the CA held at \[31\],\[32\] and \[34\] that;

> “…In our judgment, all that is required in this context of establishing the fact of possession is that the accused person must know of the existence, within his possession, control or custody, of the thing which is later found to be a controlled drug; it is not necessary that the accused person also knows that the thing was in fact a controlled drug, much less its specific nature. Let us elaborate.

> 32    As a starting point, it must be emphasised that the elements of “possession” and “knowledge” (as ingredients of the offence of importation) are separate and distinct elements and in analysing each of them, care should be taken to ensure that they are not conflated. When dealing with the element of knowledge, the inquiry is whether the accused person knew the specific nature of the drugs in question. On the other hand, when dealing with the element of possession, there is also embedded within it an inquiry into knowledge but one that is much narrower: it is limited to establishing whether the accused person knew of the existence of the thing in question that turns out to be a drug.

> …..

> 34    It therefore follows that when proving the fact of possession as an ingredient of the offence of importation, the Prosecution is not required to prove that the accused person knew the precise nature of the thing in question; all that is required at that stage of the inquiry is proof that the accused person knew that the thing that turns out to be a controlled drug was in fact in his possession, custody or control. Thus, an accused person will not be found to be in possession of drugs (even if they were within his physical custody) if they were planted on him without his knowledge.

50     The CA further explained at \[40\] that,

> “To summarise, while there is an element of knowledge that is embedded within the _fact_ of possession under the MDA, this is distinct from the _mens rea_ of the _offence_ of possession under s 8(_a_) of the MDA. The former requires only that the Prosecution establish that the accused person knew that he had physical possession, custody or control of the thing that later turned out to be a drug. This is a necessary part of proving the fact of possession because, as a matter of law, a person who does not even know that the thing in question, whatever its nature might eventually turn out to be, is within his possession, control or custody cannot be said to be in possession of it…. Section 18(1), which is the presumption of possession, is but an evidential tool which has the effect of reversing the burden of proof such that where it is relied on, it becomes the _accused person_ who must establish that he was not in possession of the drugs,… by establishing that he was never aware that the thing which was later found to be a drug was in his custody… If the Prosecution does not invoke the presumption of possession, then it must prove that the accused person knew that he was in possession of the thing that turned out to be a drug. It is only _after_ the fact of possession is proved (or presumed and unrebutted) that the element of knowledge becomes relevant – an inquiry which, as discussed above, is an entirely separate inquiry focused on whether the accused person knew the specific nature of the drug.”

### Whether the Accused has physical possession, custody or control of the drug

51     In the present case, it is not in dispute that FA-A and FA-B had been retrieved from the bag which the Accused was carrying at the time of his arrest. It is also not in dispute that the Accused knew that FA-A and FA-B were inside his bag.

52     The Defence has sought to argue that the Accused was not in physical possession because he had thought that FA-A contained tobacco and had denied that he knew it contained any other substance. With respect, counsel has in my opinion, conflated the element of physical possession with the element of knowledge of the nature of the drug. To establish physical possession in respect of FA-A, all that the Prosecution is required to do is to prove that the Accused knew that FA-A was in his possession. In other words, it is not a case whereby FA-A had been planted inside the Accused’s bag without the Accused’s knowledge. The question of what the Accused thought was in the packet is one which goes towards the element of knowledge of the nature of the drug. The Accused’s position is that he had believed the vegetable matter to be tobacco. The result of the analysis by HSA showed, however, that the vegetable matter contained the drug PINACA.

53     Counsel has referred to the case of _PP v Muhammed Shafiq bin Shariff_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 5 SLR 1317</span> to support his submission. In that case, the accused had been charged under section 7 of the MDA in relation to 4 packets of methamphetamine found in a baby milk powder box which was found in the boot of the taxi the accused entered Singapore in. The accused denied knowing the existence of the methamphetamine. The prosecution relied on the presumption under s 18(1)(a) of the MDA and the issue was whether the accused had rebutted the presumption. The High Court accepted the accused’s evidence that he did not know the milk powder box contained methamphetamine and held that the accused had rebutted the presumption under s 18(1)(a) of the MDA.

54     I note in _Muhammed Shafiq’s_ case that packets of crystalline substance were found in the milk powder container. The crystalline substance was subsequently analysed and found to contain methamphetamine. It is manifestly clear from the judgment that the High Court’s finding that the presumption in s 18(1)(a) of the MDA had been rebutted were in respect of the accused’s knowledge of the existence of the 4 packets of crystalline substance which was subsequently found to contain methamphetamine – see \[112\], \[114\], \[120\], \[124\], \[125\], \[129\], \[139\], \[140\], \[144\] and \[148\]. Knowledge of the existence of the packets is separate from knowledge of the contents of the packets. As the High Court had found that the accused did not have knowledge of the existence of the 4 packets, the issue of whether he had knowledge of the contents did not arise. The High Court’s finding that the accused was not in possession of the methamphetamine must therefore be viewed and understood in that light.

55     I am therefore of the view that _Muhammed Shafiq’s_ case does not support counsel’s submissions.

56     Counsel’s attempt at framing the issue of whether the Accused knew of the existence of PINACA in FA-A as one of fact of possession is also misconceived. The issue is really whether the Accused knew that the vegetable matter contained in the packet is tobacco which contain PINACA, or just plain tobacco. This is a question which goes towards knowledge of the nature of the contents. This is similar to the case where the content is, for example, tablets or crystalline substances. The question of whether the accused knew the tablets or crystalline substances contain drugs is one which goes towards the accused’s knowledge of the nature of the tablets or crystalline substance. The issue of physical possession would pertain only to whether the accused knew of the existence of the package or bundle containing the tablets or crystalline substance in his possession, custody or control. It is only after the issue of physical possession has been established would the issue of knowledge of the nature of the tablets or crystalline substances, that is whether they contain drugs would be relevant.

57     As the Accused has not disputed that he knew of the existence of the packets FA-A and FA-B inside his bag, I am therefore of the view that the element of fact of possession has been established beyond reasonable doubt in this case by the Prosecution. There is therefore no necessity for reliance on the presumption under section 18(1) of the MDA.

### Whether the Accused has rebutted the presumption under S 18(2) of the MDA

58     In light of the finding that the Prosecution has proved the element of fact of possession, the presumption in s 18(2) of the MDA has therefore been invoked. For the reasons as set out in \[31\] to \[44\], I am of the view that the Accused has failed to rebut the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA in respect of the Possession Charge and the charge has been made out against the Accused.

### The law pertaining to the Utensil Charge

59     Section 9 of the MDA provides:

> 9.    Except as authorised by this Act, it shall be an offence for a person to have in his or her possession any pipe, syringe, utensil, apparatus or other article intended for the smoking, administration or consumption of a controlled drug.

60     The Accused does not dispute that he was in possession of the packet of tobacco rolling paper FA-B. The issue, as such, is whether FA-B was intended for the consumption of a controlled drug.

61     As there are no statutory presumptions which can be relied upon in respect of s 9 of the MDA, it would be incumbent on the Prosecution to prove, whether by direct or circumstantial evidence, the element of intention. The Prosecution’s case is that FA-B was meant by the Accused for smoking FA-A. It is a case based entirely on circumstantial evidence.

62     A corollary to the element of intention in this case is that of knowledge. To prove that the Accused had intended to use FA-B for the consumption of the controlled drug PINACA found in FA-A, it would be necessary for the Prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused knew that FA-A contained PINACA. In this regard, the Prosecution is relying on the unrebutted presumption of the Accused’s knowledge of the nature of the drug in FA-A in respect of the Possession Charge as circumstantial evidence of the Accused’s knowledge that FA-A contained PINACA. The net effect of the Prosecution’s position is that they are seeking to apply the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA to section 9 of the MDA. This in turn raises the question of whether it is legally permissible to do so under the MDA.

### Whether it is legally permissible to cross-apply the presumption under s 18(2) to s 9 of the MDA

63     The statutory presumptions in the MDA impinge upon the presumption of innocence, a fundamental tenet of the criminal justice system, although they are justified on policy grounds (Jeffrey Pinsler in _Evidence and the Litigation Process_ (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2010) at p 426). In _Adili Chibuike Ejike v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 2 SLR 254</span>, the CA observed at \[99\] that:

> “The statutory presumptions operate to presume certain facts that would otherwise have to be proved by the Prosecution; the legal effect of these presumptions of fact is to reverse the burden of proof such that it falls on the accused person to displace what has been presumed against him.”

64     Given the basic tenet that the prosecution bears the burden of proving any charge preferred against an accused person, the statutory presumptions in the MDA, which reverses that burden, must therefore, as a matter of principle, be applied strictly within the confines as set out in the MDA. In other words, the presumptions are applicable only when and where the MDA specifically states so.

65     In _Mohd Halmi bin Hamid and anor v PP_<span class="citation">\[2006\] 1 SLR(R) 548</span>, the CA held that the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA may not be applied together with the presumption of trafficking under s 17 of the MDA. In that case, the trial judge had expressed the view that if a person is proved to be in possession of a controlled drug, by virtue of s 18(2) he is presumed to know the nature of the drugs, and then by applying the presumption in s 17, he is presumed to be in possession for the purposes of trafficking. The CA disagreed and held at \[9\] and \[10\] that:

> “… it could not have been the Legislature’s intention to have a crossover application of the presumptions under ss 17 and 18(2). Section 18(2) was a logical and direct complement to s 18(1); it is not an auxiliary provision to s 17.… If he fails to rebut the s 18 presumptions he would be liable to a conviction for possession, unless an act of trafficking, as defined in s 2, is proved against him, in which event, he would be liable to a conviction for trafficking. If, a person is proved to know (as opposed to presumed to know) the nature of the drugs in his possession, then the presumption under s 17 applies and he would be liable to a conviction for trafficking even though he did not commit any act constituting the act of trafficking defined in s 2.

> 10.    The statutory presumption under s 17 being a presumption in respect of trafficking with the possibility that the death penalty might be imposed, must be read strictly. It is a provision to facilitate the application of s 5(2), whereas s 18 concerned presumptions in respect of the possession of controlled drugs, which (possession) is another principal (though not capital) offence under the Act. The Legislature would have made it clear had it wanted s 5(2) to be further reinforced by means of s 18(2). In the absence of such an express intention, we think it best to keep the presumptions under s 18 separate from that in s 17, as has always been the case.”

66     The decision in _Mohd Halmi_ was endorsed by the CA in _Zainal bin Hamad v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 2 SLR 1119</span> at \[45\] and \[46\]:

> “In our judgment, the approach taken in Mohd Halmi should be preferred … We endorse the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in Mohd Halmi..

> 46    We emphasise, in particular, the fact that the statutory scheme of the MDA makes clear that s 18(2) is to operate as an ancillary provision to s 18(1), in the sense that where an accused is in physical control of an object, the Prosecution may rely on s 18 as a whole to invoke a presumption of possession and also of knowledge of what it is that the accused is in possession of. Further, s 18, as a whole, stands apart from s 17 in the sense that it is an entirely separate section and deals with the distinct issue of knowing possession. We add that Parliament has framed s 18(2) in terms that it may be invoked whether the fact of possession is proved or presumed.

> 47    Section 17 on the other hand is a distinct provision that is concerned with the question of the purpose for which the accused has possession of the item in question. In this context, it seems to us plain given Parliament’s explicit intention that the presumption in s 17 may only be invoked where the fact of possession is proved (see \[38\] above), that this should also be the position in relation to the fact of knowledge of the nature of the item that is in the possession of the accused.”

67     The principle and approach adopted in _Mohd Halmi_ and _Zainal bin Hamad_ is, in my opinion, applicable to the present case. Section 18(2) operates as an ancillary provision to s 18(1) to enable the Prosecution to invoke the presumptions of possession and knowledge to prove knowing possession of a controlled drug against an accused person. The provision similarly stands apart from s 9 of the MDA which is an entirely separate section dealing with possession of utensil intended for drug consumption. It is also clear from a plain reading of s 18 that the provision applies only to the possession of controlled drugs. If Parliament had intended for s 18(2) to apply to s 9, it would have been made clear in the MDA.

68     I am therefore of the view that the Prosecution cannot rely on the unrebutted presumption of the Accused’s knowledge of the nature of the drug in FA-A in respect of the Possession Charge as circumstantial evidence of his intention in the Utensil Charge. The burden of proving this element in respect of the Utensil Charge beyond reasonable doubt remain with the Prosecution. Based on the evidence adduced, I am of the view that the Prosecution has not discharged this burden.

### Whether the Prosecution Has Proven the Utensil Charge

69     It is also not possible, in my view, to draw any useful inference from the nature of FA-B and the fact that FA-B was found together with FA-A per se.

70     The tobacco rolling paper, being of a generic nature, could have been used to smoke ordinary tobacco. This was essentially the Accused’s defence. In _P Nallu Thavar v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1992\] SGHC 142</span>, the accused was convicted on a charge of possession of diamorphine and one under s 9 of the MDA in respect of a rolled $1 note. On appeal, the conviction in respect of the charge under s 9 was set aside. The court held that although the rolled $1 note was seized at the same time as the diamorphine, and on examination, found to be stained with diamorphine, these facts do not by themselves prove that the $1 note was intended for smoking, administration or consumption of a controlled drug. In the present case, FA-B was not subjected to any analysis. As such, there is no forensic evidence linking FA-B to the drug PINACA.

71     In the absence of proof, as opposed to an unrebutted presumption, that the Accused knew that FA-A contained PINACA, it would not be possible on the facts and circumstances to draw any inference that FA-B was intended by the Accused for the consumption of PINACA merely from the fact that it was found together with FA-A.

72     In the circumstances, I am of the view that the Utensil Charge has not been proven beyond reasonable doubt by the Prosecution.

## Conclusion

73     In summary, my findings are as follows:

> (a)     the Accused’s urine samples had tested positive for the consumption of 4-fluoro-MDMB-BINACA and PINACA. There were no issues concerning the procurement, chain of custody and analysis of the urine samples. The Prosecution has therefore adduced sufficient evidence to invoke the presumption under s 22 of the MDA against the Accused in respect of the Consumption Charges;

> (b)     the Accused has failed to rebut the presumption under s 22 of the MDA in respect of the Consumption Charges. Apart from the fact that his defence was a bare assertion unsupported by evidence, he had failed to disclose material aspects of his defence, namely the involvement of the Group of 4, from the point of his arrest and throughout investigations, in particular the recording of 4 statements from him. The Accused has failed to provide any adequate reason for his non-disclosure. In the circumstances, an adverse inference is drawn against the Accused that his defence is a fabrication and afterthought. Consequently, he has failed to rebut the presumption under s 22 of the MDA;

> (c)     the Prosecution has proven the fact of possession against the Accused in respect of the Possession Charge. There is no dispute that FA-A and FA-B had been retrieved from the bag which the Accused was carrying at the time of his arrest, and that the Accused knew that FA-A and FA-B were inside his bag. As such, the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA is invoked;

> (d)     the Accused has failed to rebut the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA in respect of the Possession Charge for the same reasons why he had failed to rebut the presumption under s 22 of the MDA;

> (e)     the Prosecution has NOT proven the Utensil Charge against the Accused. There are no statutory presumptions under the MDA which the Prosecution can rely on. It would not be legally permissible for the Prosecution to rely on the unrebutted presumption of the Accused’s knowledge of the nature of FA-A in respect of the Possession Charge. In the absence of proof of the Accused’s knowledge, and given the generic nature of FA-B, it would not be possible to infer that the Accused had intended to use FA-B for the consumption of a controlled drug.

74     In the circumstances, I find the Accused guilty of the Consumption Charges and the Possession Charge and convict him accordingly of the 3 charges. I am ordering a discharge amounting to an acquittal in respect of the Utensil Charge.
