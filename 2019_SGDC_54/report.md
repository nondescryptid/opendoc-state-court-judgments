\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9043/2019/01\]

25 March 2019

### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## A.   Background

#### The Charges

1       This is an appeal by the Accused against the global sentence of four months’ imprisonment for one charge of cheating under s 420 Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev.Ed.) and one charge of unauthorized access to a computer under s 3(1) of the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act (Cap 50A, 2007 Rev. Ed.) imposed on him on 25 February 2019. The Accused is Mr Karthik s/o Sankar, a 25-year old male Singaporean who had had pleaded guilty to the following charges in **DAC 931779-2018** and **DAC 931783-2018** namely:

_Exhibit C1A –_ **_1st charge (Amended)_**

“…sometime on 4 September 2017, did cheat Scoot Tigerair Pte Ltd, to wit, by using the details of a UOB credit card bearing the number xxx belonging to Han Poh Khean as payment for return tickets to Denpasar, Indonesia, amounting to S$638, to deceive Scoot Tigerair Pte Ltd into believing that you were authorised to use the said credit card details when you knew that you were not so authorised, thereby dishonestly inducing Scoot Tigerair Pte Ltd into accepting the said credit card details for payment and deliver property to you, to wit, a booking confirmation for return tickets to Denpasar for you and Chin Li Kim to Denpasar, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 420 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.”

_Exhibit C2B –_ **_5th charge (Amended)_**

“…between 15 June 2018 and 25 June 2018, in Singapore, did knowingly cause the computer of Honestbee.com.sg to perform a function of securing access without authority to the program and data held in the computer system of POSB Bank (“**POSB**”), _to wit_, by using the details of the POSB Debit MasterCard belonging to Mohammad Jouhar bin Mohamud Ali bearing number xxx, to cause the system to place orders for various items amounting to S$1,228.40 and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 3(1) of the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act, Chapter 50A (2007 Revised Edition).”

2       Four other remaining charges against him, namely three cheating charges in **DAC 931780 - 2018** to **DAC931782 - 2018** involving the unauthorized use of credit cards belonging to other persons to obtain booking confirmations from Scoot Tiger Air Pte Ltd for return tickets to travel to Bankok under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) and a charge of unauthorized access to a computer to cause the system to purchase Grab Credits and Grab rides in **DAC 931784 - 2018** under s 3(1) of the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act (Cap 50A, 2007 Rev.Ed.) were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

## B.   Statement Of Facts

3       The Statement of Facts (_Exhibit PS1_) which the Accused had admitted to without qualification is as follows:

1    The accused is Karthik s/o Sankar, a 25-year old Singaporean male.

_Facts relating to DAC-931779-2018 (1_ st _Charge)_

2    On 14 October 2017, the complainant, Teo De Fang Shannon Perry, a Risk Management Specialist at Scoot Tigerair Pte Ltd (the “company”), lodged a Police report unauthorized credit card transactions made with UOB credit card belonging to Han Poh Khean bearing number xxx (the “UOB credit card”).

3    Between January 2017 and November 2017, the accused worked as a bartender at a nightclub in Clarke Quay. During that time, the accused asked his colleague, Lee Fui Jin (“Ms Lee”), a waitress at the nightclub, to copy the details of credit cards (namely, the credit card number, CVV number, and expiry date) belonging to the nightclub’s customers and pass the details to him so that they could be sold and the proceeds split between them. The accused enlisted Ms Lee’s help to obtain credit card details because the nightclub’s customers would only hand their credit cards over to the waitresses at the nightclub (like Ms Lee) and not the bartenders (like the accused).

4    Ms Lee agreed to help the accused and the accused managed to sell the credit card details obtained in this manner for between S$20 and S$40 per credit card. The accused transferred these credit card details onto his laptop which was seized by the Police during investigations. Images showing credit card details of around 24 credit cards were found on the accused’s laptop.

5    Using the credit card details of one of the credit cards obtained in the manner in paragraph 3 above, namely, the UOB credit card, the accused on 4 September 2017 purchased from Scoot Tigerair Pte Ltd (“Scoot”) return flight tickets to Denpasar, Indonesia, for him and his girlfriend, Chin Li Kim, amounting to S$638.

6    By using the details of the UOB credit card as payment for the said flight tickets to deceive Scoot into believing that he was authorized to use the said credit card details, when he knew that he was not so authorized, the accused dishonestly induced Scoot into accepting the said credit card details for payment and delivering the booking confirmation for the said flight tickets to him. The accused has therefore committed one count of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).

_Facts relating to DAC-931783-2018 (5_ th _Charge)_

7    On 9 July 2018, the complainant Mohammad Jouhar bin Mohamud Ali lodged a Police report regarding unauthorized transactions on his POSB Debit Card xxx (the “POSB Debit Card”). The complainant is known to the accused because the complainant is the boyfriend of the accused’s friend, one Anushasheenee Balasubramaniam (“Ms Anusha”).

8    Between 3 May 2018 and 5 May 2018, the complainant, the accused, and Ms Anusha stayed at a chalet where the accused chanced upon the complainant’s unattended wallet. The accused took photographs of the front and back of the POSB Debit Card and saved the photographs on his phone.

9    More than a month later whilst the accused was on police bail, between 15 June 2018 and 25 June 2018, the accused used the POSB Debit Card, without the authority of the complainant, to purchase food, groceries, and other items amounting to S$1,228.40 using the Honestbee application on his phone on the following occasions:

10    The accused knowingly caused the computer of Honestbee.com.sg to perform a function for the purpose of securing access without authority to data held in the POSB Bank servers, and therefore committed one count of unauthorized access to computer under s 3(1) of the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act (Cap 50A).

## C.   Antecedents

4       The Accused is untraced.

## D.   Prosecution’s Address On Sentence

5       In its address on sentence, as the Accused had made full restitution in respect of all the charges, the Prosecution sought a global imprisonment term of four months’ comprising two months’ imprisonment for the s 420 Penal Code charge, and at least two months’ imprisonment for the s 3(1) Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act (“CMCA”) charge, with the sentences to be ordered to run consecutively. The Prosecution had initially sought a global sentence of at least 5 months’ imprisonment as initially restitution was made only in respect of the proceeded charges and had tendered sentencing precedents for offences under s s 420 Penal Code and s 3(1) CMCA involving the unauthorized use of credit cards. In some of these cases, no restitution had been made.

6       The Prosecution had submitted that general deterrence is the predominant sentencing consideration for offences involving the misuse of credit cards: _PP v Fernando Payagala Waduge Malitha Kumar_ (“_Fernando Payagala_”) at \[20\]. Offenders must expect harsh custodial sentences given the pre-eminence and pervasiveness of credit cards as a preferred mode of payment and the potential for such offences to have a deleterious effect on Singapore’s standing as an international financial hub: _Fernando Payagala_ at \[20\] and \[88\]. It was further submitted that 12 to 18 months’ imprisonment is the starting point for non-syndicated stolen/misappropriated credit card offences: _Fernando Payagala_ at \[75\].

7       It was the Prosecution’s case that in committing the offences, the Accused acted with clear pre-meditation which is an aggravating factor: see _PP v Tan Fook Sum_ at \[28\]. For the first charge, the Accused enlisted the help of his waitress colleague to obtain the credit card details because he could not as a bartender do so himself. After selling some of the details for $20 to $40 each, he retained some of these details in his laptop and proceeded to misuse one of them which is the basis of the first charge.

8       It was submitted that for the fifth charge, the Accused first took photographs of his friend’s credit card details and used them _more than a month later_ to purchase various items in 11 separate transactions over the course of 11 days. These were by no means spur of the moment offences.

9       Further, the Accused committed the CMCA offence set out in the fifthcharge while he on police bail. This demonstrates a blatant disregard for the law and a lack of remorse.

10     Finally, there were four charges that were taken into consideration. It was submitted that it is trite law that it enhances the culpability of the Accused as they were committed in a similar manner.

11     It was the Prosecution’s case that it is appropriate to run the sentences for the two proceeded charges consecutively. The charges involve different victims, different amounts, different _modus operandi_, and committed more than nine months apart from each other. It was submitted that the propsed sentences were fair, appropriate and consistent with the sentencing precedents and principles.

## E.   Mitigation

12     It was submitted by the Defence that the Accused is a first time offender who had pleaded guilty to two charges and with ‘five’ other charges taken into consideration. He is 25 years old and unmarried. He is now self employed as a passenger bus driver while awaiting the current proceedings.

13     The Accused comes from a single parent family and lives with his mother. She divorced her husband who committed adultery and married two women. The Accused also takes care of his grandfather who is 78 years’ old and bedridden.

#### Circumstances in which the offences were committed

#### DAC 931779-2018 (“the 1st charge”)

14     It was submitted that at the time of the offences, the Accused was working part-time as a bartender in Shanghai Dolly, a now defunct nightclub. Prior to his employment at Shanghai Dolly, he was an outstanding Rescuer and Assistant Instructor in the Singapore Civil Defence Force (“SCDF”). During his time with the SCDF, he was deemed to be a responsible and committed person who had shown good attitude throughout his tenure. He was also noted for his ability to provide good guidance for his juniors. He also attained a Perfect Attendance Award during his stint.

15     It was further submitted that while working as a bartender, he was studying for his undergraduate degree in International Tourism and Hospitality Management with the University of Sunderland via MDIS. He has since been awarded Second Class Honours (First Division) for his degree. According to his Counsel, during his time with Shanghai Dolly, he became acquainted with a female colleague, Lennan who worked as a server. Sometime in 2017, Lennan sent the Accused a photograph of a credit card and the information on it.

16     It was submitted at home, the Accused tried using his Expedia account to book a flight by Scoot Tigerair. Using his Expedia account, he had randomly selected the destination and booked a flight. He had used the information on the photograph Lennan had sent him. According to his Counsel, the Accused did not intend to travel and his sole purpose of using his online account was to verify if such transactions could indeed go through. It was further submitted that he did not travel to Denpasar (Indonesia).

#### DAC 931783-2018 (“the 5th charge”)

17     It was submitted that the Accused had ordered food and consumables on several occasions from the credit card information of the boyfriend of his friend, one Anusha. The victim in the fifth charge has since been fully restituted by the Accused.

##### First offender

18     It was highlighted that the Accused has no antecedents and he is a first offender. He is extremely remorsely and fully acknowledges his mistakes. He had committed the offences out of character and as a consequence of his youthful folly, naivety and inexperience which ultimately culminated in an error of judgment. Acccording to his Counsel, the Accused derived no benefit for the first charge.

##### Co-operation with authorities

19     It was submitted that the Accused is truly remorseful for being implicated in these offences. He had co-operated fully and assisted the authorities in investigations.

##### No steps taken to avoid detection

20     It was submitted that in respect of the first charge, the Accused never intended to travel nor did he actually travel to Denpasar (Indonesia). He had even used his Expedia Account registered under his own name so there was no attempt to conceal his act. According to his Counsel, he merely wanted to inform “William” if the credit card information could successfully secure a booking.

##### Full restitution made for all offences

21     It was further submitted that the Accused has made full restitution in respect of all of the charges against him.

##### Timely plea of guilt

22     His Counsel highlighted that even in his s 23 Criminal Procedure Code (“CPC”) statement recorded soon after his arrest, he had thought of his hard working mother, his studies and his bedridden grandfather whom he takes care of. He had also acknowledged that bad company was what that led him to the wrong path. His Counsel made reference to _Fernando Payagala_ at \[51\] to \[54\] where the High Court had acknowledged that a timeous plea of guilt is a mitigating factor and this approach was also adopted in _Lim Pei Ni Charissa v PP_ where the accused had chosen to claim trial rather than plead guilty. It was submitted that his statement clearly demonstrates his genuine, sincere remorse and his unreserved plea of guilt at the earliest possible opportunity.

23     It was the Defence’s case that s 420 Penal Code is an offence which entails punishment with a custodial sentence. The Accused was 24 years’ old at the time of the offence. It was submitted that there are special mitigating factors for the Court’s consideration for probation. According to his Counsel, at the time of commiting the offence, he was studying for his undergraduate degree in International Tourism and Hospitality Management with the University of Sunderland. This shows that he is capable of discipline in carrying out his duties and that he had achieved this result.

24     It was submitted that his mother is a Senior Government servant who has provided him with financial help all the while. Unfortunately, his father committed adultery and married twice leaving his mother to single-handedly look after him. According to his Counsel, the Accused was well-behaved and did not cause any trouble to her as a child.

25     It was again submitted that his mistake was to get a part-time job in the said pub while studying to support himself and reduce his mother’s financial burden towards him. According to his Counsel, he was a naïve and inexperienced youth who used to meet with colleagues and employees of other nearby nightclubs at a common smoking area. It was highlighted that he had used the information of the credit card to carry out a trial run out of curiosity and there was no intention for the Accused and his girlfriend to travel. He had made full restitution in respect of the first charge and he did not use the credit card information to make other purchases or benefit in any way.

##### Genuine remorse

26     It was submitted that from the outset, the Accused had demonstrated genuine remorse for being involved in such activities. While his s 23 CPC statement clearly showed he was remorseful, he had stated that the offences were committed due to the influence of the company he had met through his part-time stint in Shanghai Dolly. He had realised his folly. He no longer works in the pub and has since been self-employed as a passenger bus driver while awaiting the present proceedings to come to a close. His ambition to be a front desk agent in the hospitality industry would be diminished by a custodial sentence.

27     It was further submitted that the case of _Lim Pei Ni Charissa_ states for such offences, the offender should be given a chance for rehabilitation. It was highlighted at \[16\], the High Court had stated as follows:

“Compassion is usually shown to such offenders because they may not have had enough experience in life to realise the full consequences of their actions on themselves and on others. Yong CJ also recognised that the corrupt influence of a prison environment and the stigmatisation of having been to prison may be undesirable and counter-prodictive. As in all cases (whether involving young offenders or not), there is a need to strike a balance between public interest and the interest of the offender.”

It was the case for the Defence that given the amount involved in the offences and the facts and circumstances that led to the commission of the offence, there was a need to strike a balance between the public interest and the Accused’s interest.

#### Availability of probation order for persons over 21

28     It was the case for the Defence that the fact that the Accused is above the age of 21, does not mean that it is settled law that the Court cannot consider ordering probation for the offence he committed. The basis of this submission is that the punishment under the charges are neither:

a.     a manadatory minimum sentence

b.     a specified minimum sentence

c.     a sentence fixed by law.

29     The prescribed punishment for an offence under s 420 Penal Code is a term of imprisonment which may extend to 10 years and shall also be liable to a fine. The prescribed punishment under s 3(1) CMCA is a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both. In the case of a second or subsequent offender, the prescribed punishment is a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both. It was highlighted that the punishments under both charges do not carry a mandatory minimum sentence, a specified minimum sentence and/or a sentence fixed by law. As the punishment for both offences are not fixed in quantum and in type, it was submitted that the Court can impose probation on the Accused.

30     It was submitted that the Court’s discretion to impose probation is not limited to persons under the age of 21. In _PP v Lee Han Fong Lyon_ \[2013\] SGHC 89, the High Court had upheld a probation order for an offender who was 25 years old. It was highlighted that probation was ordered even though there were previous offences (committed 3 years prior to the offences stated in the proceeded charge) were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. It was further submitted that in that case, the factors which elevate rehabilitation are:

a.     No related antecedents;

b.     Supportive familial background;

c.     Age of the accused;

d.     No fear of recidivism;

e.     Whether the accused has learnt a lesson from Court proceedings;

f.     A crushing sentence, should not, where possible be imposed on the relatively young and

g.     A more deterrent sentence than necessary should not be imposed given the particular circumstances.

31     It was further submitted that in applying the factors considered in _Lee Han Fong Lyon_ to the present case, the factors which elevate rehabilitation over deterrence are clear. According to Counsel, as the punishment prescribed under s 420 Penal Code are not fixed by law (and even though he is above the age of 21), the credit card offences allow for probation to be ordered. In _Lim Pei Ni Charissa v PP_ , it was highlighted that probation was ordered even after the accused had claimed trial to charges under s 420 Penal Code.

32     According to his Counsel, there were exceptional circumstances warranting the grant of probation against the Accused and that he fell within the archetype of Penal Coode offences as all were only test runs. Whatever losses suffered by Scoot have been restituted. It was submitted that probation was suitable instead of a custodial sentence as the Accused had committed these offences out of naivety and inexperience. He had assisted in investigations and had admitted to the commission of all the offences proceeded with. It was further submitted that sending him to prison would cause irreparable damage to his future career prospects in the hospitality industry especially since he had now graduated with a Second Class (Upper Division) degree. It was highlighted that his mother would give any undertaking that the Court may impose if probation is granted.

33     It was submitted that the Court should depart from any benchmark when considering the Accused’s sentence. Reference was made to the cases of _Dinesh Singh Bhatia s/o Amarjeet Singh v PP_ \[2005\] 3 SLR(R)1 and _Fernando Payagala_ to highlight that the circumstances of each case are of paramount importance when determining sentence. Benchmarks and/or tariffs have significance, standing and value as judicial tools but ought not to be applied rigidly or religiously. It was further submitted that the Court should take into account the Accused’s mitigating factors, the circumstances in which he committed the offences and the limited role he played when calibrating the appropriate sentence for him. The Accused only wished for the Court to be lenient with him and give him a chance to redeem himself.

## F.   Prosecution’s Reply

34     In response to the assertion in the mitigation where the Defence had claimed that the Accused had not intended to travel and his sole purpose of using his online account was to verify if such transactions could go through, it was submitted that the Court should give very little weight to such proclaimed purpose. This is because the Accused went on to make several transactions. The Accused had gone on to use several other credit cards in the second, third and fourth charges which occurred three weeks’ after the first charge. He had used a DBS credit card and a Citibank credit card to book flights from Scoot. It was further submitted that it could not be out of curiosity. The system was tested and he went to try other transactions and they all went through. The Court should give short shrift to the idea that he was just testing the first card. According to the Prosecution, there would not have been any need to test the other credit cards.

35     It was the Prosecution’s case that the Defence’s submission for probation was inappropriate in the circumstances. The test the Court should apply in deciding whether probation should be granted for an offender who is above 21 years of age is if he or she demonstrates an extremely strong propensity for reform and/or there are exceptional circumstances warranting the grant of probation. It was submitted that there were no exceptional circumstances in the present case.

36     In response to the Defence’s reference to the case of _Lim Pei Ni Charissa_ at \[16\], it was highlighted the earlier sentences in that paragraph the High Court had stated the following:

“16    In _PP v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice_ at \[21\] and \[25\], Yong Pung How CJ stated that rehabilitation is the dominant consideration where the offender is 21 years and below. The appellant here was between 17 and 18 years of age when she committed the offences. She is now 20 years old. Young offenders are in their formative years and chances of reforming them into law-abiding adults are better…”

It was highlighted that compassion should be shown to offenders who are below 21 years of age. It was suggested by the Prosecution that by the Defence not putting the full quote, it had unintended consequences.

37     The Prosecution had also referred to paragraph 30 of the case which they say is important as it shows the exceptional circumstances the Court would consider as appropriate namely:

“30    …Yet, in the light of a unique combination of factors, including the appellant’s age at the time of the offence, her role in the offences, her subsequent acknowledgment of her wrongs, her family support, her baby and her receptiveness to the terms of her probation plan…”

The Prosecution highlighted that the appellant Lim was 17 to 18 at the time of the offence. In the present case, the Accused is 24 years old at the time of the offence. The second important fact was that the Court had considered that the appellant had a baby. It was submitted at at \[29\] of that case, the Court was not prepared to have her baby brought up in the prison environment. Those were exceptional circumstances that a 17 to 18 years old offender was given probation.

38     It was further submitted that there was nothing of this nature in the present case. It was the Prosecution’s case that if the Court considers the circumstances of this case, the aggravating factors and the fact that general deterrence must be the prodomiant sentencing consideration, probation was inappropriate in these circumstances.

39     In response to the Defence’s reliance on the case of _Lee Hang Fon Lyon_ at \[42\] of the mitigation, it was submitted that the accused suffered from ADHD and the High Court found that the ADHD played a role in the psyche of the respondent and was a factor in his criminality. It was further submitted that the offence in that case did not involve the use of credit cards where general deterrence took precedence. In addition, the issue of the accused’s age did not appear to have been extensively discussed in that case unlike the full grounds in _Lim Pei Ni Charissa_ where age was given full consideration.

## G.   The Sentences

#### Prescribed punishments for cheating and unauthorised access to computer material

40     The Accused is a first offender. The prescribed punishment he faced for an offence of cheating and dishonestly inducing the delivery of property under s 420 Penal Code is a mandatory term of imprisonment which may extent to 10 years and the offender shall also be liable to a fine. The prescribed punishment he faced for unauthorised access to computer material under s 3(1) CMCA is a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both.

41     In the present case as the Accused had made full restitution in respect of all the charges, the Prosecution had sought a global imprisonment term of four months’ comprising two months’ imprisonment for the s 420 Penal Code charge, and at least two months’ imprisonment for the s 3(1) Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act (“CMCA”) charge, with the sentences to be ordered to run consecutively. The Prosecution had submitted that general deterrence is the predominant sentencing consideration for offences involving the misuse of credit cards: see _Fernando Payagala_ at \[20\]. It was the Prosecution’s case that based on same case at \[20\] and \[88\], offenders must expect harsh custodial sentences given the pre-eminence and pervasiveness of credit cards as a preferred mode of payment and the potential for such offences to have a deleterious effect on Singapore’s standing as an international financial hub. Hence, it was submitted that probation was inappropriate in the circumstances of the present case as there were no exceptional circumstances to warrant the grant of probation to the Accused who was above the age of 21 in the present case.

42     In contrast, even though he was above 21 years of age, the Defence had urged the Court to call for a pre-sentence report for probation in view of of the exceptional circumstances and mitigating factors warranting the grant of probation against the Accused. To persuade me to call for a pre-sentence report for probation, his Counsel had placed great emphasis on the fact that the Accused is a first offender, full restitution had been made for all the offences, his genuine remorse, his good records with the SCDF, the degree he had obtained in International Tourism and Hospitality Management, his family background and the impact of a custodial sentence on his prospect of being employed as a front desk agent in the hospitality industry. In addition, his Counsel had argued that the offences were committed as a consequence of his youthful folly, naivety and inexperience and had blamed the commission of the offences on the bad influence of his peers at work during his part-time stint at the pub.

#### Should a pre-sentence report have been called in the present case?

43     As highlighted by the High Court in _PP v Lim Chee Yin Jordon_ at \[29\], it is trite that a probation order accords primacy to the principle of rehabilitation. Accordingly, rehabilitation had to be shown to be the dominant sentencing principle in order for a probation order to be justified. At \[31\] of the same case, it was further stated that in the High Court in _PP v Lim Cheng Ji Alvin_ held (at \[6\]–\[7\]) that the law takes a presumptive view that with young offenders, the primary sentencing consideration is rehabilitation, but that this is not presumptively the case with an older offender. It is clear from case law that the probation is the exception rather than the norm for adult offenders.

44     In the present case, the Accused was not a young offender below the age of 21 years but was already a 24 year-old adult, working as a bartender at a night club when the offences were committed. While working as a bartender, he studied for his undergraduate degree through MDIS. He had also completed his National Service with the SCDF prior to that. He is presently 25 years’ old and employed as a passenger bus driver. Under these circumstance I was unable to accept the Defence’s contention that he had committed the offences as a consequence of his “youthful folly”, naivety and inexperience. Accordingly, rehabilitation should no longer be the main sentencing consideration in this case.

45     As a general rule, probation is inappropriate for serious offences or where violence has been committed. In the present case, the offences committed by the Accused are considered to be serious offences as he had committed an aggravated form of cheating which carries a mandatory imprisonment term together with offences concerning the unauthorised access to computer material. Nevertheless, I was mindful that rehabilitation can be an operative concern of an offender above the age of 21, particularly if he or she demonstrates an extremely strong propensity for reform and/or there are exceptional circumstances warranting the grant of probation as set out by the High Court in _Goh Lee Yin_ \[2006\]1 SLR(R) 530 at \[28\].

46     In addition, the rehabilitation of the offender can also take precedence where other sentencing considerations such as deterrence are rendered less effective, as might be the case for an offender belabouring under a serious psychiatric condition or mental disorder at the time of the incident at \[29\] in _Goh Lee Yin_. This is not the case for the Accused person as there is no evidence that he was labouring under any serious psychiatric condition or mental disorder which had a causal link to the commission of the offences.

47     On the facts of the present case, I disagreed with the Defence as to the existence of exceptional circumstances as stated in his submissions and did not find any exceptional circumstances warranting the grant of probation in the present case. To my mind, although there were mitigating factors present, this could not be equated with exceptional circumstances which had a higher threshold. Furthermore, there were aggravating factors as reflected in the Statement of Facts for this case which weighed clearly in favour of deterrence. Accordingly, I did not accept the Defence’s submissions that there were factors present which elevated rehabilitation over deterrence in the present case.

48     I agreed with the Prosecution that the case of _Lee Hang Fon Lyon_ relied upon by the Defence can be distinguished from the present case as the accused in that case suffered from ADHD, the High Court had found that the ADHD played a role in the psyche of the respondent and was a factor in his criminality and the case did not involve the use of credit cards. In that case, the accused had pleaded guilty to offences of impersonating a police officer under s 170 Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev.Ed.), an offence of drug consumption under s 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev.Ed.) and an offence of driving without a valid driving licence under s 35(1) Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004, Rev.Ed.). Three other similar charges were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

49     In my view, the Accused had not demonstrated an extremely strong propensity for reform as he had reoffended and committed the offence in the fifth charge while he was on police bail. I agreed with the Prosecution that this demonstrated a blatant disregard for the law and a lack of remorse. The probation order granted in _Lim Pei Ni Charissa_ can be distinguished from the present case as she was a young offender who was 17 to 18 years old when she committed the offences and who was 20 years old at the time of sentencing. Furthermore, in _Lim Pei Ni Charissa_, the unique combination of factors, including her age at the time of the offence, her role in the offences, her subsequent acknowledgment of her wrongs, her family support, her baby and her receptiveness to the terms of her probation plan were critical factors in the Court’s decision to grant probation in lieu of imprisonment.

50     Having regard to the nature of the offences, the number of charges faced by the Accused as well as the fact that he had committed the fifth charge while he was on police bail, I did not call for a pre-sentence report for probation. I was of the view that the present case was not exceptional one where rehabilitation remained the dominant sentencing consideration and that probation would be appropriate.

51     I then went on to consider the appropriate sentence for the two proceeded charges. The Prosecution had tendered sentencing precedents involving the unauthorised use of credit cards which were unreported cases. In the absence of any reasoned judgments in these precedents, I did not place much reliance on these precedents.

52     In my assessment of the Accused’s culpability, I took into account the fact that the Accused was a first offender, he had made full restitution for all the charges and had pleaded guilty to two charges with the remaining four charges taken into consideration. He had expressed his remorse in his caution statement. I was also mindful of the present case involves the misuse of credit cards as well as the potential for such offences to have a deleterious effect on Singapore’s standing as an international financial hub in my consideration of the amount of harm done.

53     In addition, I had considered the aggravating factors present in this case. I agreed with the Prosecution that the Accused had acted with clear premeditation. He had admitted that while working as a bartender at the said nightclub, he had asked his colleague, who was waitress to copy the details of credit cards namely, the credit card number, CVV number, and expiry date belonging to the nightclub’s customers and pass the details to him so that they could be sold and the proceeds split between them. He had enlisted her to obtain credit card details because the nightclub’s customers would only hand their credit cards over to the waitresses at the nightclub and not the bartenders.

54     After selling some of the credit card details for $20 to $40 each, he retained some of these details in his laptop and proceeded to misuse one of them which is the basis of the first charge in **DAC 931779 - 2018**. I noted that a large number of the credit card details i.e. for around 24 credit cards were found in his laptop. In respect of the fifth charge in **DAC 931783 - 32018**, the Accused had taken photographs of a POSB Debit MasterCard belonging to his friend’s boyfriend sometime in May 2018 and had used them more than a month later using the Honestbee application to purchase various items in 11 separate transactions from 15 June 2018 to 25 June 2018 amounting to $1,228.40. I agreed with the Prosecution that these were by no means spur of the moment offences but deliberate acts committed by the Accused over a period of time. Accordingly, I placed no weight on Counsel’s contention that the Accused had committed these offences as a consequence of his youthful folly, naivety and inexperience. In blaming the commission of the offences on the bad influence of his peers at work, the Accused was clearly not accepting any responsibility for his wrongdoings.

55     In addition, I did not accept the Defence’s claim that the Accused had not intended to travel and his sole purpose of using his online account was to verify if such transactions could go through. The Accused had gone on to use several other credit cards in the second, third and fourth charges in **DAC 931780- 2018** to **DAC 931782 - 2018** which occurred three weeks’ after the first charge. I agreed with the Prosecution that it could not be out of curiosity. The system was tested and he went to try other transactions and they all went through.

56     After a careful consideration of the above factors, in view of the dominant sentencing principle of general deterrence, the aggravating factors highlighted above, as well as the mitigating factors, I was of the view that a sentence of 2 months’ imprisonment for each of the proceeded charges in would be just and approporiate in the present case. I ordered the sentences for **DAC 931779-2018** and **DAC 931783-2018** to run consecutively as they were distinct offences and I agreed with the Prosecution that the offences involved different victims, different amounts, different modus operandi and that they were committed nine months’ apart.

57     Dissatisfied with my decision, the Accused had filed a Notice of Appeal against his sentences on 25 February 2019. The Accused is currently on bail pending the hearing of his appeal.
