2       Ridzuan was liable to enhanced punishment for both charges for breach of a basic condition of his remission order under section 50T(1)(a) Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2000 Rev Ed).

3       At the end of the trial, I convicted Ridzuan and Thava on the charges. Before the appointed date for sentencing, Thava absconded and a Warrant of Arrest was issued against him on 8 March 2022. At the time of writing these Grounds of Decision, Thava remained at large.

4       On 22 April 2022, when Ridzuan was due to be sentenced for the two charges for which he had been convicted after trial, he pleaded guilty to three previously stood down charges relating to rioting, voluntarily causing hurt and using abusive words with five other charges were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. He was sentenced on five charges, for the two charges he had been convicted of after trial and the three charges he pleaded guilty to.

5       Ridzuan has now appealed against his conviction and sentence. I first deal with his appeal against conviction followed by his appeal against sentence on the five charges.

## The undisputed facts

6       The undisputed facts as provided by the Joint Statement of Agreed Facts (P3) as well as the facts that emerged unchallenged at trial were that on 11 December 2017, both Ridzuan and Thava were in a rented silver Volvo bearing deregistered licence plate no. SCN2256J driven by Shanker Mahalingam (“Shanker”), together with Nor Mohamad Azril Bin Sajali (“Azril”) and Juraimi Bin Jupri (“Juraimi”). They proceeded in the Volvo to 93A Rowell Road (“the premises”) where Sikder Sujan (“Sujan”) was residing in Room 4 at the 2nd floor of the premises.

7       At around 3.00 am, Ridzuan, Thava, Juraimi and Azril gained entry into the premises with a key that Thava had in his possession. The door to the premises was self-locking and could not be entered without the use of a key. Ridzuan, Thava, Juraimi and Azril ascended the stairs to the 2nd floor. Shanker remained with the car. On the 2nd floor, Sujan, Soleman Alam (“Soleman”), Alamgir Md (“Alamgir”) and Rana Salim were present in Room 4.

8       At about 3.08am on 11 December 2017, Sujan used Soleman’s phone to make a police report (P4) that four persons took money from his friend which had been collected that day.

9       Shanker left Singapore for Malaysia on 17 December 2017 at about 8.06 am via a motorized boat from Changi Creek.

10     Thava left Singapore on 29 December 2017 for Malaysia on a 30-day social visit pass which expired on 28 January 2018 after which he overstayed in Malaysia.

11     A Warrant of Arrest was issued against Thava and Shanker on 15 January 2018 (P15) and 15 February 2018 (P14) respectively. Shanker and Thava were arrested by Malaysian police on 12 April 2018 and handed over to the Singapore police.

12     Azril, Juraimi and Shanker each pleaded guilty to a charge of committing gang robbery together with Ridzuan and Thava with a charge of housebreaking by night with common intention being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. Azril pleaded guilty on 5 February 2020 whilst Shanker and Juraimi pleaded guilty on 9 March 2020.

13     CCTV footages taken from cameras in the vicinity of 93A Rowell Road and photographs were admitted with the consent of parties. The location of the CCTV cameras was reflected at P7 and a summary of the footages and screenshot was reflected at P9.

## Summary of the prosecution’s evidence

### Events leading up to the incident on 11 December 2017 and after

14     On the night of 10 December 2017, Shanker called Safit and instructed him to rent a car and get lookouts to be alert for police in civilian attire and police cars in the vicinity of Rowell Road and Veerasamy Road. Shanker also told Safit to change the licence plate on the car; procure and place gloves in the car and to leave the car and its keys at an open carpark in Rangoon Lane. Safit proceeded to instruct Valier Emmanuelle Ramanee (“Valerie”) and Udaya Kumar s/o Manoker (“Udaya”) to rent a car. They proceeded to rent a silver Volvo bearing licence plate no. SLM9630L. Safit passed Valerie and Udaya another license plate with a deregistered licence plate SCN 2256J which they affixed over the rental car’s license plate.

15     Thereafter, Valerie drove the Volvo to the Rangoon Lane carpark at about 1.00 am. She had gone to Mustafa Shopping centre to buy 5 pairs of gloves and duct tape. She passed the items to Udaya. Udaya used the duct tape to tape the deregistered number plate to the silver Volvo and placed the five pairs of gloves in the car. He left the Volvo at the carpark with the keys on top of the back tyre. Udaya called Safit and he was instructed to go a coffee shop. He left with Valerie in Valerie’s car for the coffeeshop and saw Safit and Maresh s/o Raja Prakash (“Maresh”) at the coffee shop. Muhammad Ashraf Bin Haniffa (“Ashraf”) and Muhammad Hafiz Bin Nuryusof (“Hafiz”) were there as well. Valerie then drove all six of them and dropped off Ashraf, Hafiz and Maresh towards the main road. Safit testified that his role was that of a lookout at the vicinity of Rowell Road and Veerasamy Road. He also deployed Ashraf, Hafiz, Maresh and Noorul Amin S/O Noor Mohamed (“Noorul’) as lookouts. They were instructed to lookout for car movements including police cars and police in civilian attire. Safit testified that it was Shanker who instructed him to do all these things. The rest of them proceeded back to the Rangoon Lane carpark where the Volvo was and wiped the car as instructed by Safit to do so. Valerie testified that the wiping down of the car was to erase traces of something that had been illegally done.

16     Safit testified that on 11 December 2017, Shanker left $5,000 on a plastic bag at his doorstep which was meant for Maresh, Valerie, Noorul, Ashraf, Udaya and Safit. Safit took $1,000 for himself and he gave $4000 to rest of them. Safit paid Udaya $500 for his efforts. Safit passed Valerie $1,000 for her efforts, of which $500 was to be passed to Maresh. Valerie testified that when she asked Safit what the money was for Safit replied that that it was for something do with robbery or kidnapping in the morning of 11 December 2017.

17     From the CCTV video footages, the following sequence of events took place.

18     On 11 December 2017 at about 1.12am, Juraimi and Azril met up at the junction of Serangoon Road and Rangoon Road. They then walked along Rangoon Road. At about 2.16am, at the entrance of Starlight Terrace along Rangoon Road, Juraimi and Azril boarded a white Hyundai which was driven by Shanker at the material time, with Thava seated at the front passenger seat.

19     At about 2.19am, Ridzuan drove his white Subaru and parked it at Starlight Terrace. At about 2.24am, Azril alighted from Shanker’s white Hyundai and fetched Ridzuan from Starlight Terrace to Shanker’s white Hyundai which was parked along Rangoon Road. At about 2.25am, after Azril and Ridzuan boarded Shanker’s white Hyundai, the five of them proceeded to the car park. At about 2.44am. while at the carpark, all five of them alighted from Shanker’s white Hyundai and boarded the silver Volvo rented by Valerie. At about 2.51am, Shanker drove the silver Volvo with the four others as passengers and exited the Carpark. The silver Volvo arrived as 93A Rowell Road at around 3.01am. At about 3.05am, Juraimi, Azril, Ridzuan and Thava boarded the silver Volvo and proceeded back to the carpark. While at the carpark, the five of them alighted from the silver Volvo and boarded Shanker’s white Hyundai. At about 3.08am, Shanker drove out of the carpark and sent Azril and Ridzuan back to Starlight Terrace. He then dropped Juraimi off by the road.

20     Valerie, Udaya and Safit pleaded guilty to offences under s 204A Penal Code for their involvement in providing the rental car with an affixed false licence plate for the group to use in the robbery.

### Evidence of the complainants

21     Sujan testified that he was with Soleman, Alamgir and Rana Salim in Room 4 at the second floor of 93A Rowell Road when two men entered the room while two other men stood outside. Sujan identified one of the men who entered the room as “bulky and dark skinned” and the other as “thinner and light skinned”. The dark skinned person said “We are from CID” and “Don’t move”. Sujan genuinely believed that they were from the police and complied with their instructions by handing over his identification documents. Sujan and Alamgir were running an illegal remittance business which involved them collecting money from other Bangladeshi nationals. Thereafter, they would arrange for the money to be sent to persons in Bangladesh. Sujan thought that someone had reported his illegal remittance business to the police which was why they were there.

22     The dark skinned person kept his arm around Sujan. The lighter skin man searched the room and recovered cash amounting to $300,000 which was in Sujan’s possession at the material time which he had counted and put into two separate bags of $290,000 (green paper bag) and $10,000 (white paper bag).

23     The $300,000 cash was collected from the following persons. Iqbal Hussain had given him $150,000, Ismail had given him $50,000, Haque Ainal (“Ainal”) had given him $70,000 and Mamun MD (“Mamun’) had given him $30,000. Mamun testified that on 10 December 2017, he gave Sujan $30,000 at 93A Rowell Road to remit back to Bangladesh. To date, Sujan had only returned $9,000 to $10,000 of his money. Ainal testified that he passed $70,000 to Sijan at 93A Rowell Road on 10 December 2017. He later found out that the money had been stolen and Sijan had not returned him any of the money.

24     Sujan testified that both bags were taken by the lighter skinned man and passed to a man standing outside the room. The two men who came into the room then brought Sujan and Soleman down. They returned their identification to Alamgir, boarded the car, and left. Sujan called the police immediately at 3.08am after realising that the group were not police officers. In court, when asked to identify Thava and Ridzuan, Sujan said that they looked familiar and thought that these were the persons who had entered the room but could not be sure. He identified Thava as “most probably” the dark sinned man. Sujan conceded that he did not pick our Ridzuan from an identification parade conducted by the police on 16 January 2018. Thava was not present at the identification parade as he had not been arrested at that time.

25     Sujan testified that the persons who had given him the monies for remittance were putting pressure on him and his family to give the money back. He had returned part of the money by selling off land which he had in Bangladesh. However, he had only managed to return $50,000.

26     Alamgir testified that Sujan and himself had collected money from people from Mustafa Centre as well as people who had come to the room to pass them the money. They counted the money and it amounted to $300,000.

27     Alamgir testified that three men entered the unit and one of the men entered the room and said “We are from CID, give us your permit and mobile phones.” He understood what the man said to mean the police. They were scared as they thought the police had gotten to know about the money in the room and complied with the instructions. Alamgir saw someone coming down holding a white plastic bag which was the same bag collected as part of the illegal remittance business, Alamgir was unable to identify Thava and Ridzuan as the persons who entered the room as he did not see the faces of the men who entered the room.

### Evidence of Juraimi, Shanker and Azril

28     Juraimi, Shanker and Azril were called as prosecution witnesses.

29     Juraimi, confirmed his plead guilty papers (P25) which named Thava and Ridzuan in the charges and the Statement of Facts as having conjointly committed gang robbery with himself, Azril and Shanker. Juraimi identified Ridzuan and Thava in court. However, when questioned by the Deputy Public Prosecutor (“DPP”) about the gang robbery, he repeatedly said that he “cannot remember” and “don’t want to remember about all these things”. When given a chance to refresh his memory under s 161 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“Evidence Act”) with his police statements, Juraimi agreed that he provided the contents voluntarily to the investigators but said that the contents were “nonsense” as he was “tripping”, having drunk alcohol the night before and not being able to sleep.

30     The Prosecution thereafter applied to cross examine Juraimi under s 156 Evidence Act and impeach him under s 157(c) Evidence Act with his police statements, with a view to substituting his oral testimony under s 147(3) of the Evidence Act. Both Defence counsel did not object to the Prosecution’s application to cross examine Juraimi or to the admissibility of his police statements but reserved the right to make submissions on the weight to be accorded to the statements.

31     In Juraimi’s police statements P 30 and P 31, he stated that he had been part of a plan to steal money from 93A Rowell Road. Thava knew of a particular Bangladeshi subject who would collect money from several Bangladeshi nationals, which could range from $300,000 to a million dollars in a day. About a month prior to the robbery, Shanker, Juraimi, Azril, Ridzuan and Thava engaged in multiple discussions on how to steal the money. All five of them then executed the robbery on 11 December 2017 pursuant to that plan. According to Juraimi’s statements, Ridzuan and Thava remained in the room at 93A Rowell Road, whilst Juraimi and Azril escorted two Bangladeshi nationals down to the first floor.

32     Juraimi testified that he was paid $7,000 by Shanker for the robbery.

33     Investigating Officer (“IO”) Asrihan bin Asmawi, who was the recorder of Juraimi’s police statement P30 on 9 January 2018, testified that Juraimi was coherent in his replies and appeared normal. He readily cooperated and provided credible information on the amount of money he received for his involvement in the robbery. Juraimi led the Police officers to his house to recover cash of $5,500 which was a portion of the stolen money.

34     ASP Ang Wee Kiat recorded Juraimi’s further statement P31 on 16 January 2018. He testified that from his interactions with Juraimi he was coherent and alert, able to understand English and there was no complaint from him.

35     When Shanker was called as a witness for the Prosecution, his responses to question from the DPP ranged from “No comment” to “I can’t remember” and then he stated he had some problem as he had been locked in so he could not think properly. He stated that he did not want to corporate as he had already been sentenced. The Prosecution thereafter applied to cross examine him under s 156 Evidence Act which both Defence Counsel did not object to. The Prosecution did not seek to admit any of Shanker’s police statements under s 147(3) Evidence Act. The Defence cross-examined Shanker’s on a portion of his police statement of 17 April 2018 under s 147(3) Evidence Act which was admitted as D1.

36     When Azril was called a witness for the Prosecution, he confirmed that he and Ridzuan were part of the Omega Secret Society. Azril testified that he was paid $5,000 for the robbery. When asked about the robbery, he said he could not remember the details and stated that he did not wish to help the court as he had already received his sentence. He confirmed that he had pleaded guilty to the gang robbery charges which named Ridzuan and Thava as well as Juraimi and Shanker as having conjointly committed the gang robbery with him. He had admitted to the Statement of Facts as he could not afford to engage a lawyer for trial. He pleaded guilty in the hope that he would get a lighter sentence.

37     During an adjournment of his evidence in court, Azril had spoken to Ridzuan and when the DPP asked him what he had spoken to Ridzuan about he said it was nothing to do with the case and told the DPP that it was “none of your business”. On re-examination by the Prosecution, Azril stated that he did not wish to speak anymore. The Prosecution made an application to impeach Azril under s 157(c) Evidence Act with his previous police statement P33. In P33 Azril had stated that he did not know anyone by the name of Shanker, Thava, Wan \[referring to Ridzuan\] and Remy \[referring to Juraimi\] and the DPP stated that it was clear that he was friends with Ridzuan which he had confirmed in his evidence in chief.

38     In P33 he was asked if he had committed a crime at Rowell Road with four other subjects and he stated that on a day he was told to come somewhere where he was picked up in a car. The car drove to a location where he alighted and he went up with others into a unit. He walked down alone with one male Bangladeshi. The same group re-entered the car and drove off. On the same day he received a transfer of $5,000. The DPP put to Azril that nowhere in P33 did he deny that he was not involved in a crime.

39     P33 was admitted without objection by Defence counsel as P33 but reserved the right to make submissions on the weight to be attributed to the statement.

## Prima Facie case

40     Defence counsel for Thava and Ridzuan did not make a submission of no case to answer. I was satisfied that the prosecution had established a prima facie case for both charges and the Thava and Ridzuan were called to enter their defence. Ridzuan and Thava were the only witness called for the defence. As this appeal only concerns Ridzuan, I set out Ridzuan’s evidence and the salient parts of Thava’s defence.

## Ridzuan’s defence

41     Ridzuan testified that he started working part time at Club Bollywood in October 2017, some three months prior to the incident on 11 December 2017. Ridzuan knew Azril from the same Secret Society Group. They were friends and Azril had introduced him to work at Club Bollywood (“the Club”). Azril was at that time also working at the Club.

42     Juraimi was Ridzuan’s manager at Club Bollywood. Shanker was a regular and big spender at the Club and Juraimi knew him. Juraimi introduced Ridzuan to Shanker. Ridzuan and Shanker had had casual conversations such as “hi” and “bye”. Ridzuan also testified that Safit was always with Shanker when Shanker was at the club.

43     Ridzuan asked Juraimi what Shanker was working as. Juraimi told him Shanker was managing contractor projects. Ridzuan asked Juraimi to inform him if there were any job opportunities as he would like to work there.

44     On 10 December 2017, one day before the incident, Ridzuan got a call from Shanker in the morning. Prior to that they had exchanged phone numbers. Shanker asked Ridzuan if he was really interested to work. Ridzuan asked Shanker for more details of the work and Shanker said that he would call him again. Ridzuan then received call from a private number in the afternoon. Ridzuan thought that the caller was Shanker as the caller said, “You have work” and the caller had the same voice as the person who called him in the morning. Shanker informed him that the job required him to work as a bouncer as they needed to move a safe box from Point A to another place and he needed to make sure that everything was okay. Ridzuan was required to stand by for the job at night. Shanker did not tell Ridzuan who he would be working with. Ridzuan recalled that the salary for the job was “quite big”. To his mind, Ridzuan thought that the safe box had money or something valuable in it.

45     At about 9.30 or 10.00 pm that evening, Ridzuan got a call (who he thought was from Shanker) telling him to get ready and in about one and a half hours later go to the Rangoon area. Ridzuan was to tell him where he parked once he had reached the Rangoon area.

46     Ridzuan drove his Subaru car and reached the Rangoon area around 11.00 pm or 12 midnight. He parked at an open car park at Starlight Terrace. He told Shanker where he had parked and saw Azril. He was surprised to see Azril and asked him if Shanker had also called him to work. Azril then brought him to another vehicle, a Volvo, beside the road at Starlight Terrace. In the Volvo were Juraimi, Shanker and Thava. Shanker was the driver of the vehicle. Ridzuan seated at the rear behind the front passenger seat. The five of them left in the car and subsequently stopped beside a road to smoke.

47     In the Volvo he spoke to someone who he now knew as Thava. Thava had informed Ridzuan of his name, but he did not memorise it. Ridzuan testified that this was the first time he had met Thava. Ridzuan asked Thava about the work and Thava said that they needed to help his friend carry the safebox, to bring to another place. Ridzuan did ask him that it felt like a job that was wrong and Thava then took out a key for them to go to that place. After being shown the key, Ridzuan did not ask Thava further as he did not know Thava well. He then smoked and had casual conversations with Azril.

48     Once the car reached the location, Thava, Azril, Juraimi and Ridzuan got out of the car. Thava walked towards the door of the place of incident and used the key to open the door. Thava was the first to go up and Ridzuan was the last. In between was Juraimi and Azril but he was not sure of the order. They went up in a single line. At the top of the stairs, he saw “four Indians” there. Thava and Juraimi went into the room and “a few Indians” followed them into the room. The situation was calm and there was no shouting. He did not hear anyone uttering the words “CID” or anyone identifying themselves as CID officers at any point in time. Azril and Ridzuan were outside the room.

49     Shortly after, Azril went down and “an Indian” followed him. One “Indian” and Juraimi went out of the room and passed by Ridzuan. Someone, possibly Juraimi or Thava, passed Ridzuan a dark coloured paper bag. Ridzuan could not see what was in the paper bag as it was covered. Juraimi went down and then Ridzuan went down. At the entrance of the apartment, he saw Azril, the “Indian” and Juraimi. Shanker was standing outside the car. Ridzuan entered the car carrying the paper bag. Juraimi, Azril, Thava and Shanker all entered the car and they drove off.

50     Ridzuan did not know where they were driving to, but he supposed that it was a place with workers and where they were supposed to deliver the money to. They drove to an open car park after a short drive. During the journey there Shanker was speaking to someone in Tamil and Juraimi frequently looked at the back. At the open space car park, everyone got out of the car. There was another car next to it and everyone went into that car. Ridzuan was unsure as to what happened to the paper bag as he did not bring out with him. He saw a patch of grass and urinated there. Ridzuan thought that they had switched cars for security as the amount of money was large. Shanker drove Ridzuan to where had parked at Starlight Terrace and told him take his car back. Azril asked Ridzuan for a lift back home. Shanker told Ridzuan that he would call him later. Ridzuan drove off with Azril inside and sent him back and he then went back. To date, Ridzuan had not received any money for the job on 11 December 2017. When he called Shanker the next day and asked him about it, Shanker said that it was not settled, and he would come back to him.

51     Ridzuan maintained that he never participated in any discussion on robbing anybody. He said that when he was inside the unit, he never felt that the “Indian persons” were forced to do anything or that they were threatened. He thought they were Shanker’s workers and that it had to do with a construction project.

## Thava’s defence

52     Thava testified that he had known Shanker for more than 15 years and he had known Shanker though his cousins. He knew Safit through Shanker. He had seen Ridzuan once when he was at an Indian restaurant.

53     As for the incident on 11 December 2017, he was given a job by one “Munshir” to bring a safe box at Rowell Road from point A to point B. Munshir had given Thava a key to access the premises to go up to the 2nd floor. Munshir would pay them $1,000 which amounted to $150 to $200 for each person. Munshir did not tell Thava what was in the safebox, but he assumed it would be money or jewellery.

54     When they arrived at Rowell Road, he was the first to approach the door and unlock it with the key given to him by Munshir. At the second floor, he entered the room with Juraimi. Ridzuan and Azril were outside the room.

55     In the room he saw a number of people in the room and asked where the safe box was. They asked, “what safe box?” and he was confused. He then left the room to call Munshir but was unsuccessful in reaching him. He said that Juraimi were talking to the occupants of the room about something, but he did not listen to the conversation. He then saw Ridzuan and Juraimi going down. Thava was the last to leave and they left in the car driven by Shanker. Shanker drove them to an open space car park and told Thava that since they were moving a safe box, they needed a car with a bigger boot to accommodate the safe box. They then dropped Ridzuan and Azril at Starlight Terrace, Juraimi at Tessensohn Road and Shanker and Thava went to the Thompson area.

56     Thava testified that that he left Singapore as he was being harassed by the accomplices for payment of money for the job as well as to help out his father’s flower business by getting flowers from Cameron Highlands and Thailand.

## Prosecution’s submissions at the close of trial

57     The Prosecution highlighted the following facts which were not disputed. Sujan and Alamgir were staying at 93A Rowell Road, on the second floor, in room 4. To access the second floor, a key has to be used to open the main door and one has to take the stairs from the first floor to the second floor. The main door was an automatic lock door, which would be locked whenever it was closed. Sujan and Alamgir were running an illegal remittance business which involved them collecting money from other Bangladeshi nationals in front of Mustafa Centre and from people who delivered the money to their room. Thereafter, they would arrange for the money to be sent to persons in Bangladesh. At the material time, Sujan and Alamgir were in Room 4 together with two other Bangladeshi nationals, namely Soleman and Rana Salim.

58     Valerie, Udaya and Safit each pleaded guilty to offences under s 204A of the Penal Code for, amongst other things, their involvement in providing the rental car with an affixed false licence plate for the group to use in the robbery. Shanker, Juraimi and Azril pleaded guilty to one charge each under s 395 of the Penal Code and consented to one charge under s 456 read with s 34 of the Penal Code being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

59     The video evidence adduced along with the testimonies of Safit, Valerie and Udaya, clearly showed a level of coordination in the early morning of 11 December 2017 to execute the plan. This could not have happened without prior planning, especially since there was also a need to first rent and prepare a car for the group to use in the commission of the offence.

60     The Prosecution submitted that Sujan and Alamgir were credible witnesses and full weight should be given to their evidence. Their accounts of the events were not only consistent with each other but also corroborated by several pieces of evidence. This included Juraimi’s police statements, as well as the charges and Statements of Facts which were admitted to without qualification by Juraimi, Azril and Shanker. In addition, Sujan’s account of the robbery being committed on 11 December 2017 was corroborated by the fact that Sujan called the Police within minutes of the robbery. Sujan and Alamgir had thus opened themselves up to criminal liability and have been punished for their offences. They each pleaded guilty to a charge of carrying on an unlicensed remittance business under s 6(1) of the Money-Changing and Remittance Businesses Act (Cap 187, 2008 Rev Ed). In the Joint Statement of Facts that they admitted to without qualification, it was stated that they had collected cash amounting to $300,000 from fellow Bangladeshi nationals on 10 December 2017.

61     The Prosecution submitted whether the accomplices could afford a lawyer for trial did not detract from the truthfulness of the facts stated in their plead guilty papers and the weight that can be placed on their respective pleas of guilty. The accomplices’ pleas of guilty were corroborative of the fact that the five offenders (including Ridzuan and Thava) had planned and executed a gang-robbery to steal money from Sujan on 11 December 2017. According to Juraimi’s police statements P 30 and P 31, there were multiple discussions prior to 11 December 2017 between all five members of the group who committed the robbery.

62     The Prosecution submitted that Juraimi, Azril and Shanker were clearly not credible witnesses in court, and they went to great lengths to be uncooperative and hostile witnesses so that they would not implicate Ridzuan and Thava.

63     The Prosecution submitted that Ridzuan was “an incredible witness and his evidence in court should be rejected.” Further, Ridzuan’s defence was internally inconsistent. In his statement recorded on 12 January 2018 (P35) and his Case for Defence (P34), Ridzuan repeatedly stated that Juraimi and Azril were the ones who initially went down to the first floor. However, when Ridzuan’s counsel was cross-examining and putting his case to Juraimi and Azril on the stand, Ridzuan’s case shifted, and it was put to them that Azril and Ridzuan were the ones to initially proceed down to the first floor followed by Thava and Juraimi.

64     The Prosecution submitted that Ridzuan’s actions with regard to the paper bag of money which he was handed appear entirely incongruous with a person who genuinely believed he was performing an “escort” job for a large sum of money. The Prosecution submitted that Ridzuan had tailored his own evidence in relation to his own relationship with Thava, and what Ridzuan knew of Thava’s involvement in the offence.

65     The Prosecution submitted that in the round, the evidence clearly showed that all five persons (including Ridzuan and Thava) were intricately involved in the robbery from the initial planning to the actual execution.

## Defence’s submissions at the close of trial

66     The Defence submitted that Ridzuan did not have any knowledge that a gang-robbery of S$300,000 or housebreaking was going to take place. Ridzuan was not involved in any prior discussion or planning of a gang-robbery. Instead, Ridzuan was led to believe by Shanker that he was merely performing a legitimate job, namely to assist in the moving of a safe box.

67     While not disputing that Ridzuan was present at the scene, the Defence submitted that Azril and Ridzuan stood outside the room whilst Thava and Juraimi were inside the room. Ridzuan was therefore unaware as to what was happening inside the room but recalled that the situation was calm when Thava and Juraimi entered into the room and there was no shouting from the complainants. Ridzuan also did not hear and/or witness anyone identifying themselves as CID officers at any point in time. During this time, Ridzuan received a dark coloured paper bag from someone inside the room. As the dark coloured paper bag was sealed, he could not see what was contained inside.

68     The Defence urged the court to accord little weight to the police statements of Juraimi and Azril and/or the plead guilty papers of Juraimi, Azril and Shanker.

69     In the case of Juraimi’s police statements, the Defence submitted there were a number of material inconsistencies between his previous statements and his plead guilty papers. Further, Juraimi’s had testified in court that he had spoken nonsense in his previous statements and that there was no planning prior to the robbery. As for Juraimi’s plead guilty papers, the Defence submitted that Juraimi had stated that he had pleaded guilty because he did not have enough resources to claim trial and that he was hoping for a more lenient sentence.

70     The Defence urged the court to accord little to no weight to Shanker’s plead guilty papers, as Shanker’s evidence was that he had pleaded guilty because of the fact that he had other charges and that he wanted a more lenient sentence.

71     The Defence urged the court to accord little to no weight to Azril’s plead guilty papers, as Azril had testified that there was in fact no other meetings before 10 December 2017 where a gang-robbery was discussed and that he was, like Ridzuan, at 93A Rowell Road for a job and did not know that anything illegal was going to happen. Defence counsel also submitted that Azril’s inconsistencies arising from his evidence in court with his previous statement P33 were not material and his oral testimony should not be disregarded in its entirety even if the court found that he had been impeached with his previous inconsistent statement.

72     The Defence contended that the prosecution had not proved that a sum of $300,000 had been taken that night as the monies were not recovered nor was there any documentary evidence of this sum of money being taken.

73     The Defence submitted that Ridzuan’s testimony was largely consistent with Thava’s evidence at trial that there was no prior meeting or discussion among the five of them prior to the incident. It was submitted that Ridzuan’s evidence was further corroborated by Shanker’s police statement D1 where Shanker had stated:

> The job is to move safe box and he requires security to secure the movement of the safe box. \[…\] Thus I started to make calls to my contacts asking them whether they are interested to work. I recalled that I called Juraimi, Wan or also known as Wan Black \[referring to Ridzuan\] and another person whom I addressed as Baby \[referring to Azril\]. I asked them whether they wanted to \[do\] the job as the trio have ever asked me for any job. I have known them from Bollywood Club as I always frequent there. Juraimi, Wan and Baby is working as a bouncer of the said Bollywood Club. When I called them, they agreed to join me for the job.

74     The Defence submitted that D1 should be accorded its due weight since it was largely corroborated by the evidence of Juraimi, Azril, Ridzuan and Thava.

75     The Defence submitted that if there was a reasonable doubt that Ridzuan was involved in the planning of the gang-robbery, then _a fortiori_ the Prosecution has not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Ridzuan had conjointly committed gang robbery with Thava, Shanker, Azril and Juraimi whereby “conjointly” referred to the united or concerted action of the persons participating in the transaction.

76     At its highest, the Defence submitted that all the Prosecution could establish was that Ridzuan had simply had knowledge of the alleged wrongful restraint and not that he had physically wrongfully restrained or caused the wrongful restraint of the alleged victim. The Prosecution’s case was not one of common intention to wrongfully restraint, but one of knowledge. It was submitted that knowledge alone was insufficient to attribute constructive liability on the secondary offender, namely Ridzuan, for acts that he did not physically commit.

## The court’s decision at trial

77     To prove gang robbery, the Prosecution was required to prove the following:

> (a)     A theft was committed on 11 December 2017 at about 3.00 am at 93A Rowell Road;

> (b)     In committing the theft, wrongful restraint was used on the victims; and

> (c)     There were five or more persons (including Ridzuan) who conjointly committed the robbery and/or were present and aided in such commission.

78     To prove housebreaking by night, the Prosecution was required to prove the following:

> (a)     Ridzuan, pursuant to a common intention he shared with Shanker, Juraimi, Azril and Thava had entered the premises, a human dwelling in the possession of Sujan, with the intent to commit an offence of gang robbery between 7.00pm and 7.00 am; and

> (b)     Thava opened a locked door to allow himself, Juraimi, Azril and Ridzuan to gain entry into the premises.

79     It was not disputed that both Ridzuan and Thava were present on the premises with Azril and Juraimi having been driven there in a car by Shanker. The key issues that arose at trial were whether a sum of $300,000 had been taken from Sujan through wrong restraint and whether Ridzuan had conjointly committed the gang robbery with Thava, Shanker, Azril and Juraimi.

### Whether a sum of $300,000 had been taken

80     Sujan had given evidence of the origins of the $300,000 in that he had received monies from one Iqbal Hussain ($150,000), Ismail ($50,000), Ainal ($70,000) and Mamun ($30,000). Sujan testified that he was certain that cash of $300,000 was taken from his room because he counted the money and had packed them into two separate bags, with $290,000 in a green paper bag and $10,000 in a white plastic bag. Both Mamun and Ainal testified and corroborated the respective amounts they had given to Sujan.

81     Sujan and Alamgir pleaded guilty to a charge of carrying on an unlicensed remittance business under s 6(1) of the Money-Changing and Remittance Businesses Act (Cap 187, 2008 Rev Ed). At paragraph 5 of the Joint Statement of Facts (P22) which they admitted to without qualification at their plead guilty mention on 16 October 2018, it was stated that Sujan and Alamgir had on 10 December 2017 collected cash amounting to $300,000 from fellow Bangladeshi nationals who worked in Singapore, and who wanted to remit the monies from Singapore to their families in Bangladesh.

82     Sujan made a police report immediately after the incident. In doing so, he opened himself up to criminal liability given that he was running an illegal remittance operation. In my view, there was no reason for Sujan to make the police report immediately after the incident unless a sum of $300,000 had in fact been taken from him. Indeed, he pleaded guilty and admitted at the plead guilty mention that he had collected cash of $300,000 from fellow Bangladeshi nationals on 10 December 2017, Sujan testified that he continued to be harassed by the persons who had passed the monies to him to repay the $300,000. Sujan’s evidence was largely corroborated by Alamgir’s evidence with to the $300,000. Alamgir’s evidence was that Sujan and himself had collected money from people from Mustafa Centre as well as people who had come to the room to pass them the money. They counted the money and it amounted to $300,000.

83     Having reviewed the evidence, I accepted Sujan’s and Alamgir’s account with regard to the $300,000 which was supported by Mamun and Ainal. In the circumstances, I found that cash in the amount of $300,000 had been taken that night from Sujan’s possession.

### Wrongful restraint

84     The definition of “wrongful restraint” is stated at s 339 of the Penal Code as follows:

> Whoever voluntarily obstructs any person, so as to prevent that person from proceeding in any direction in which that person has a right to proceed, is said wrongfully to restrain that person.

85     Sujan testified that the four men went to the second floor of 93A Rowell Road of which two of them entered the room where he was residing in while the remaining two stood outside. Soleman, Alamgir and Rana Salim were with Sujan in the room. Sujan identified one as bulky and dark skinned and the other as thinner and light skinned. The dark skinned person said, “We are from CID” and “Don’t move”. Sujan genuinely believed they were from the police and with their instructions by handing over his identification documents. The dark skinned person kept his arm around Sujan. Sujan also thought that someone had reported his illegal remittance business to the Police and that was why they were there. In addition, Sujan believed that should he try to run, the group would have forcefully kept him in the room. Sujan called the police immediately after realising that the group was were not police officers. Alamgir testified that one of the men who entered the room and said, “We are from CID, give us your permit and mobile phones.” He understood what the man said to mean the police.

86     Sujan and Alamgir’s account were also corroborated by Juraimi’s police statement P 31 where he stated at paragraphs 13.2 and 13.3 as follows:

> According to Thava, he knows that some Bangladeshis are collecting illegal money as such we can go and take the money from them. He told us that we can threaten the Bangladeshi to surrender the money to us because Bangladeshi are generally easy to bluff/threaten. Further, Thava say that the money is illegal money and they won’t go to the Police.

> Thava only told us that we just need to threaten then \[sic\] and there is no need to use force on them. He mentioned that he has a Bangladeshi informal \[sic\] who can tell him where to go.

87     In this regard, Sujan’s evidence that the dark skinned man had informed that he was from CID was part of the bluff/threat on the Bangladeshis which Juraimi had spoken about in P31 without the need for violence. Sujan would comply as he was running an illegal remittance business and would be frightened of the police. This in fact turned out to be the case.

88     On the evidence, I accepted Sujan and Alamgir’s evidence on this aspect and found that the element of wrongful restraint had been established by the Prosecution.

### Ridzuan’s role

89     The next key issue to consider was Ridzuan’s role and whether he had knowledge that a robbery was to take place and was involved in the planning of the robbery. Ridzuan’s defence was that he was recruited only the day before by Shanker to move a safebox and maintained that he never participated in any discussion on robbing anybody. He said that when he was inside the unit, he never felt that the “Indian persons” were forced to do anything or that they were threatened. He thought they were Shanker’s workers and that it had to do with a construction project.

90     In _Prasong Bunsom v PP_ \[1995\] 3 SLR (R) 15 the Court of Appeal held at \[49\]:

> The essential element of gang-robbery is that there must be five or more persons acting “conjointly” in the commission of the robbery. _Ratanlal & Dhirajlal on the Indian Penal Code_ (27th Ed, 1992) defined “conjointly” as referring to the **united or concerted action of the persons participating in the transaction.**

> \[emphasis added\]

91     The Defence had submitted that if there was a reasonable doubt that Ridzuan was involved in the planning of the gang-robbery the Prosecution had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Ridzuan had conjointly committed gang robbery with Thava, Shanker, Azril and Juraimi.

92     The Defence contended that even if it had been established that Ridzuan had knowledge of the alleged wrongful restraint, such knowledge alone was insufficient to attribute constructive liability on the secondary offender (ie Ridzuan) for acts that he did not physically commit.

93     On the evidence, I note that while Sujan was able to identify Thava as “most probably” the person in the room, he was not absolutely certain if Ridzuan was the second person on the room. That said, both Ridzuan and Thava did not dispute being present on the premises, although they disputed their roles and in the case of Ridzuan, and whether he had entered the room where the complainants were in.

94     Both Sujan and Alamgir testified that one of the men who entered the room had identified themselves as being from the CID and asked for their permits and phones which caused them to be scared and they accordingly complied with the instructions. The other person searched the room and eventually recovered the two bags of money amounting to $300,000.

95     The Prosecution called Shanker, Azril and Juraimi to testify as prosecution witnesses but it was clear that they were hostile witnesses as they chose not to remember even simple details about the case and questioned why they had to testify when their case had been dealt with. In this regard, the Prosecution sought to impeach Juraimi and substitute his evidence with his two police statements, P30 and P31 under s 147(3) Evidence Act.

96     In P30 Juraimi stated as follows:

> I was told by Thava that he has this one Bangladeshi whom provided information to Thava every month, a particular Bangladeshi subject would be collecting monies from a lot of Bangladeshi nationals. Thava also told me that the said Bangladeshi would receive $300,000 to million dollars one day. Initially, it was just a talk however as time pass by, Thava and Shanker started to talk about taking the money from the said Bangladeshi whenever they visit my club. I just hang around with them and hear them talk. However, I do not \[sic\] who is the informer and who is the Bangladeshi national who collected the money.

> There is one particular day when Shanker and Thava, Wan black \[referring to Ridzuan\], baby \[referring to Azril\] and myself were sitting in the club and we started to talk about how we going to take the money from the male Bangladeshi national.

> Shanker and Thava told us that they will make all the arrangement, including getting cars to proceed to the place. Shanker and Thava also told me that they have made arrangement for a team to look for Police presence. The location to hit was at Rowell Road. Shanker and Thava just told us to be ready whenever they call. I recalled that one of us did ask about how much each of us would receive by doing this. However, either Shanker or Thava replied that they wouldn’t know as we have yet to get the money.

97     In P31 Juraimi stated at A13 as follows:

> There were a few discussions before the incident. It started about a month plus ago when the give us were discussing at Bollywood at the club. It was however very brief and it was a week before the incident when we discussed more details and I know that we are going to act soon. I remember that time, Shanker called me to meet him and Theva \[sic\] at Mackenzie road coffeeshop. That time, I was with baby \[referring to Azril\] and Wan \[referring to Ridzuan\] and we met up with Theva \[sic\] and Shanker.

98     In P30 Juraimi stated that once at the premises, Thava went into the room first followed by Ridzuan with Azril and himself standing outside the room. Subsequently, Thava and Ridzuan were the only two remaining in the room. In P 30 Juraimi stated that Ridzuan was aware that they were to take money from the Bangladeshi nationals:

> Q4)    Was Wan black \[referring to Ridzuan\] and Baby \[referring to Azril\] informed that they were to take money from the Bangladesh nationals from the unit as well?

> A4    Yes. They were aware.

99     The Defence urged the court not to accept Juraimi’s statements as evidence under s 147(3) Evidence Act and stated that there were inconsistencies between Juraimi’s statements and the Statement of Facts and further that Juraimi had agreed in court that there were these inconsistencies. Juraimi had testified that he had spoken nonsense in his 9 January 2018 statement (P30) and that there was in fact no meeting that included Ridzuan and Azril. Juraimi stated that he had pleaded guilty because he did not have enough resources to claim trial and that he was hoping for a more lenient sentence.

100    I set out the Defence’s submission in a table of the alleged inconsistencies between Juraimi’s statements and the Statement of Facts which he pleaded guilty to.

101    In considering the evidential weight to given to Juraimi’s statements, I first consider Juraimi’s claim that he spoke nonsense in his statement P30 and that he was tripping. As the Prosecution had pointed out, P30 was recorded on 9 January 2018 at 7.47pm after he was arrested on 8 January 2018 at 11.50 am (P12), and as such it would not have been possible for Juraimi to have consumed alcohol the night before as Juraimi had claimed as he was in the police lock-up the night before P30 was recorded. Under cross-examination, Juraimi agreed that any such alcohol consumption would have had to take place on the night of 7 January 2018 would have had _no effect_ on his state of mind at the time of the recording of P30[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2):

> Q    So, even if you had drank alcohol and did not sleep well on the night of 7th January 2018, this would have had no effect on your state of mind by 7:47pm on 9th of January 2018 when P30 was recorded. Do you agree?

> A    Yes.

102     _A fortiori_, this could not have had any effect on his state of mind during the recording of the P31, which was recorded on 16 January 2018 at 9.40pm, some seven days after the recording of the P30.

103    In this regard, it was IO Asrihan’s and ASP Ang’s evidence as the recorders of P30 and P 31 respectively that Juraimi was coherent when giving his statements as opposed to “tripping” as Juraimi claimed. I accordingly found that Juraimi was not intoxicated and was in a proper frame of mind when he voluntarily gave his police statements P30 and P31.

104    Turning to the alleged inconsistencies between P30 and P31 as to the prior meetings to discuss the robbery, I found that they were not inconsistent. P 31 A13 referred to a few discussions before the incident while P 30 referred to a particular day where the incident was discussed.

105    As for the alleged inconsistencies between P 30 and P 31 on Juraimi’s account of who was in the room, despite his claiming at not being able to remember anything in court, Juraimi did in fact give details of the robbery in court. In this regard, he testified in court that _Thava and Ridzuan were the last to leave the room_ whilst he and Azril brought the Bangladeshis down[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3):

> Q    Who went down with you?

> A    Baby. \[refers to Azril\]

> Q    Anybody else?

> A    And 2 Banglas.

> **Q**      **Where was Thava and Ridzuan?**

> **A**      **Still upstairs.**

> \[emphasis added\]

106    This corroborated what he had stated in P30 Thava went into the room first followed by Ridzuan with Azril and himself standing outside the room and that subsequently, Thava and Ridzuan were the only two remaining in the room.

107    In considering the evidential weight to be ascribed to Juraimi’s police statements P30 and P31 as opposed to his evidence in court, I had regard to the undisputed facts which were as follows. There was the use of a hired car with fake license plates together with the deployment of lookouts to watch out for police cars and police in civilian attire. Five pairs of gloves were purchased and left in the car. There was also the switching of cars, the wiping down of the car by Udaya and Safit to erase traces of something illegally done as testified by Valerie. This led me to the conclusion that this was a well-planned robbery which would have required detailed planning and coordination prior to the incident which Juraimi had alluded to in P30 and P31 when he spoke of the discussions before the robbery.

108    The use of a key by Thava to effect entry into the premises also corroborated by Juraimi’s police statement P30 that Thava had an informant about the details of the premises and feeding him information of what was happening. Sujan and Alamgir’s testimony that the robbers identified themselves as CID officers after which they surrendered the monies corroborated Juraimi’s police statement where Thava had stated that Bangladeshis could be easily threatened to surrender the money. The fact that the monies were illegal monies which ranged from $300,000 to a million dollars was corroborated by Sujan and Alamgir pleading guilty to conducting an illegal remittance operation and having $300,000 that night and the same sum that was taken that night from Sujan.

109    Further, Juraimi testified in court that he was paid $7,000 for the job and led police to his place of residence where $5,500 was seized (P11). It was Azril’s evidence that he received $5,000 for the job.

110    As such, I find that Juraimi’s statements P30 and P31 were corroborated in material parts by the objective facts of the case and could be relied in place of his oral testimony. I accordingly gave P30 and P31 evidential weight with regard to whether there were any prior discussions before the incident and who was in the room with the complainants.

111    As for the evidential weight to be ascribed to Juraimi’s Statement of Facts which he admitted to in his plea of guilt, in _PP v Liew Kim Choo_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] SGHC 210</span> (“_Liew Kim Choo”_) Yong CJ highlighted at \[89\] and \[90\] several factors that militated against treating an accused person’s statement of facts as evidence which could, on its own, convict the accused’s accomplice. First, there existed the possibility that a person might plead guilty and admit to a statement of facts even though he was innocent, thereby rendering the statement of facts inaccurate. Second, the statement of facts was not prepared by the accused or prepared based on an interview with him but by the investigation officer or the Prosecution based on the evidence they had against the accused. Third, the judge’s duty in accepting the statement of facts only extended to ensuring that the accused had admitted to all the material particulars to the offence; it did not require him to scrutinise every detail to make sure it was accurate, especially with regard to details which were not material to the accused person’s conviction but could be material to the conviction of an accomplice.

112    As for Defence’s submission that Juraimi had pleaded guilty because he did not have enough resources to claim trial and that he was hoping for a more lenient sentence, I noted that Juraimi was represented by counsel when he pleaded guilty. His counsel had tendered a written mitigation plea (P 29) on his behalf, which stated at paragraph 10 that Juraimi had fully co-operated with the authorities at all times and had spoken the truth. That said, bearing in mind Yong CJ’s cautionary note in _Liew Kim Choo_, I had ascribed evidential weight to his statements P30 and P31 as opposed to the Statement of Facts. The Statement of Facts was simply confirmatory to show that Juraimi had pleaded guilty to an offence of gang robbery committed together with Ridzuan and Thava.

#### Evaluating Ridzuan’s defence

113    Ridzuan’s defence was that he was tasked to move a safe box and was never involved in any discussions of robbery. His evidence in court was that he met Thava only on the day of the incident. His case was that he did not enter the room with Thava where the complainants were in and had gone downstairs first with Azril before Juraimi and Thava.

114    There were inconsistencies between Ridzuan’s police statements P35 and his Case for the Defence (P34) where he stated that Azril and Juraimi were the one who proceeding downstairs. In Ridzuan’s police statement P 35 at paragraphs 3.8 and 3.9, he had stated as follows:

> When I arrived at the second floor, Thava was talking to a group of 4-5 Indian nationals in English and some language which I don’t understand. Also during this time when I was walking up the stairs, **I saw baby \[referring to Azril\] bringing down one or two of the person and then Remy \[referring to Juraimi\] also brought down another one or two from the group leaving two of the male Indians inside the room.**

> When I reached the room, I saw Thava was holding on to their ID or work permits. He then passed me a dark colour paper bag containing money. The money was packed properly and taped with a scotch tape. I then took the money and went down straight to the car. **When I was downstairs, I saw Remy \[referring to Juraimi\] and Baby \[referring to Azril\] and were walking to the Indians they escorted down.**

\[emphasis added\]

115    At paragraph 7 of his Case for the Defence, it was stated as follows:

> While the Accused was waiting at the corridor outside Room 4, he noticed Indians existing from Room 4 and proceeding downstairs. **The Accused also noticed Azril and Juraimi proceeding downstairs thereafter.**

\[emphasis added\]

116    The upshot of what Ridzuan had stated in P 35 and his Case for the Defence was inconsistent with what was put by Ridzuan’s counsel to Juraimi and Azril where he stated that he and Azril went down from the room first. This was what the DPP set out in his cross-examination of Ridzuan with regard to what was put to Juraimi by Ridzuan’s counsel[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4):

> Q.    Mr. Wijaya \[Ridzuan’s counsel\] had put to Mr. Juraimi, “The four of you all went---took the stairs upstairs to the 2nd floor and Ridzuan was at the back.” “Thereafter at the 2nd floor, you and Thava---” in other words, Juraimi and Thava, “were inside the room while Ridzuan and Azril were standing outside the room. After that, two Bangladeshi persons came out of the room and Azril brought the two Bangladeshi persons downstairs.” **He had then put to Mr. Juraimi**, “**You did not follow the two Bangladeshi persons downstairs. You remained inside the room with the other remaining Bangladeshi workers. Subsequently, either you or Thava passed Ridzuan a paper bag. And then Ridzuan brought the paper bag downstairs. And subsequently, you and Thava---” in other words, Juraimi and Thava, “brought the two Bangladeshi workers downstairs**. And then you, Ridzuan, Thava, Azril, left in the car driven by Shanker.” So, my question is, your instructions to Mr. Wijaya that day to put to Juraimi. **The sequence was, Azril go down, you went down leaving Juraimi and Thava upstairs. And then, Thava and Juraimi coming down.**

\[emphasis added\]

117    The same question was asked by the DPP in his cross-examination of Ridzuan with regard to what was put to Azril by Ridzuan’s counsel [\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5):

> Your counsel had, on your instructions again, put your case to Mr. Azril. And let me read to you from the Notes of Evidence what was put to Mr. Azril. He had said, **“Thereafter, you---” meaning Mr. Azril, “went down the stairs together with two of the Bangladeshi and Indian nationals.”** Mr. Azril answered, “Yes.” Subsequently, Mr. Wijaya had put to Mr. Azril, “**After a while, Ridzuan came down, holding something in his hand.** Recall or you are unable to recall?” Azril said, “I cannot remember.” Next, Mr. Wijaya put to Mr. Azril, “**And subsequently, Thava and Juraimi came downstairs and you, Thava, and Juraimi went into the car**.” So, again, **the sequence put to Mr. Azril is Azril went down, Ridzuan went down, then Thava and Juraimi went down**.

\[emphasis added\]

118    In my view, these inconsistencies were material and an attempt by Ridzuan to distance himself from placing himself in the room with Thava where the inference that could be drawn was that he was the “lighter skinned man” (per Sujan’s evidence) who had searched the room for the money. Ridzuan’s evidence in court was that it was Juraimi (and not him) that was with Thava in the room. I agreed with the Prosecution that this was a belated attempt by Ridzuan to place Juraimi in the room with Thava after having heard Sujan’s testimony that there were two persons in the room, one of whom was searching for the money, and therefore implying that Thava and Juraimi were the last two to go down after Azril and Ridzuan.

119    Ridzuan’s earlier position in his police statement P35 that Juraimi and Azril went down first was in fact consistent with Juraimi’s statement P30, where he stated that Ridzuan was in the room with Thava and that Juraimi and Azril were outside the room:

> I noticed a room with the door opened. I saw 3 to 4 male Bangladeshis nationals. Thava went in first followed by Wan Black \[referring to Ridzuan\]. Baby \[referring to Azril\] and myself were standing outside the room.

> Thava then brought two of the male Bangladeshi national out from the room and told baby to escort them down. I followed them and I also walked down. **By this time, Thava and Wan Black \[referring to Ridzuan\] was the only two inside the room.**

> {emphasis added\]

120    Next, Ridzuan was inconsistent as to whether he knew Thava prior to the incident. In his police statement P36, he stated that he had met and spoken with Thava _several times_ at the Club before 11 December 2017 as well as Thava having called him _several times_ on that day informing of him of the job. The relevant portions of Ridzuan’s statement P36 were as follows:

> **From thereon I started to speak to Shanker and his friend by the name of Thava whenever the visited the club and I got to know them.**

> On the day of the incident in the morning, I received a call from Shanker. Shanker asked me whether I am still looking for a job. I replied yes. I require job. **Shanker told me that lateron \[sic\], Thava will call me to provide details.** Shanker than hang up the phone.

> **Thereafter, I received a call from Thava.** Thava explained to that there is vacancy to mover \[sic\] involving a high end rich businessman. Thava told me that my pay would be around 1 thousand plus. I was also told that apart from the monthly pay, the tip that usually offered by the business is usually huge. Thus I agreed to the proposal. **Thava told me he would get back to me.**

> **Thava called me again later in the day and asked me whether I am free tonight**. I told him I am free. Thava told me to come down to Serangoon tonight. I agreed.

> \[emphasis added\]

121    Ridzuan’s evidence in court was materially different from P36. He claimed that _he had met Thava only on the date of the incident_ and that prior to that it was Shanker (and not Thava) who had called him and informed him about the job[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6):

> Q    I see. In any event, Mr. Ridzuan, **you had testified that Shanker gave you 3 calls that day**, one---in your Evidence-in-Chief, once in the morning, once in the afternoon, and then third call, you were a---you---you were asked by Mr. Genghis, “What happened after the second call with Shanker on the afternoon of 10th December 2017?” You say, “I got a phone call asking me to be ready. And then, about 1 hour or 1½ hour later to go to Rangoon area.” “Now, who did you receive this phone call from?” “If you ask me, I think it’s Shanker.” **So, you have said Shanker, Shanker, Shanker, correct?**

> **A**      **Correct.**

> Q     **And you maintain that the first time you met with Thava is that night when you entered the car at Starlight Terrace, correct?**

> **A**      **Correct.**

> \[emphasis added\]

122    In my view, these were material inconsistencies which was an attempt by Ridzuan to distance himself from having known Thava earlier and having a detailed conversation with Thava about the job.

123    Ridzuan’s evidence in court on his actions regarding the paper bag of money which he claimed he was entrusted with was internally inconsistent with his own evidence. In this regard, Ridzuan’s evidence was that the safe box had money or something valuable in it, but that he had lost track of the bag after alighting from the silver Volvo and when he went out to urinate. Yet, it was Ridzuan’s own evidence that he thought that they had switched cars for security as the amount of money was large. To my mind, Ridzuan’s lackadaisical attitude with regard to the paper bag was entirely incongruous with a person who genuinely believed he was performing an “escort” job for a large sum of money.

124    I was of the view that Ridzuan’s defence was not assisted by what was stated by Shanker in D1 where Shanker stated that he recruited Ridzuan, Azril and Juraimi offering them a job without mentioning that a robbery was to take place. In my view, what Shanker had stated in D1 was against the weight of the undisputed evidence that a carefully planned robbery had taken place on the night of 11 December 2017. It was simply not credible that such a robbery would involve several innocents (namely Ridzuan, Azril and Juraimi) who were not clued in or involved in the planning of the robbery and had no inkling that a robbery or anything illegal would be committed. D1 was also not consistent with Ridzuan’s evidence in court who sought to place Juraimi in the room with Thava and would therefore have been in the know and involved in the searching and taking of the monies.

125    As for Azril’s evidence in his police statement P33 that there were no other meetings before 10 December 2017, similar to my position on Shanker’s police statement D1, I did not find this credible as the undisputed evidence was that this was a carefully planned robbery with the use of lookouts, the switching of cars and the use of false licence plates. I did not accept that such a robbery could have taken place without any prior planning and discussion with those who were to be present on the premises. Azril’s evidence in P33 where he claimed to not knowing his accomplices (including Ridzuan) was entirely not reliable as he had acknowledged in court that he was friends with Ridzuan as they were members of the same Secret Society which Ridzuan also confirmed in his evidence. Further, Azril testified that he was paid $5,000 for the robbery and confirmed that he had pleaded guilty to the gang robbery charges which named Ridzuan and Thava as well as Juraimi and Shanker as having conjointly committed the gang robbery with him. It was clear to me that as a friend of Ridzuan and being members of the same Secret Society, Azril did not want to implicate Ridzuan in the gang robbery. An example where Azril had demonstrated his friendship with Ridzuan was when he had spoken to Ridzuan during an adjournment of Azril’s testimony. When the DPP asked him what he had spoken to Ridzuan about he said it was nothing to do with the case and told the DPP that it was “none of your business”.

126    On the evidence, I found that Ridzuan was involved in the planning of the gang robbery together with Juraimi, Shanker, Azril and Thava. I found that his defence that he had no knowledge of the gang robbery as not credible, and I found that he was the other person in the room with Thava that day and was the one who had searched the room for the money.

127    For completeness, I set out my findings on Thava’s defence. It was Thava’s defence that he was tasked one Munshir to move a safebox and it was Munshir who has passed him the key to the premises. Thava testified that that he left Singapore as he was being harassed by the accomplices for payment of money for the job as well as to help out his father’s flower business by getting flowers from Cameron Highlands in Malaysia and Thailand.

128    It was not disputed that Thava left Singapore for Malaysia 18 days after the incident even before the police were looking for him. Thava overstayed in Malaysia. In my view, there was no reason for him to overstay for such a long period without renewing his social visit pass. I did not find his evidence that he was being harassed by the co-accused persons for small amounts of money as a credible reason for him to leave Singapore. Further, it was Juraimi’s evidence that he was paid $7,000 of which $5,500 was seized by the police and Azril’s receiving $5,000 for the job did not gel with Thava’s testimony that they were to be paid a few hundred dollars for moving the safe. As such, I found that Thava left Singapore even before the police were looking for him as an inference of a guilty mind having committed gang robbery.

129    Despite having Munshir’s contact number in his phone, Thava did not furnish it to the police nor enlist their assistance in the past three years (since his arrest in April 2018) to locate Munshir. If anything, it was likely that Munshir (or whatever his real name was) was Thava’s informant about the robbery as stated by Juraimi in his police statements and was the one feeding Thava information about the robbery. After all, Thava’s own evidence was that Munshir was the one who had given him the key to the premises. I accordingly found that Thava’s defence was not credible. I found that Thava was in the room that day with Ridzuan and was the one who stated that “We are from CID” and “Don’t move” and had kept his arm around Sujan.

### Conclusion on the charges

130    For the housebreaking by night charge, I had found on the evidence that Ridzuan and Thava had entered the premises at about 3.00 am on 11 December 2017, a human dwelling where Sujan resided with intention to commit gang robbery.

131    Thava had used a key to access the main door of the premises, which was locked which allowed Thava, Ridzuan, Juraimi and Azril to enter the premises. In this regard, s 445(d) Penal Code provides as follows:

> A person is said to commit “house-breaking”, who commits house-trespass if he effects his entrance into the house or any part of it in any of the 6 ways hereinafter described; or if, being in the house or any part of it for the purpose of committing an offence, or having committed an offence therein, he quits the house or any part of it in any of such 6 ways:

>> ….

>> (_d_)    if he enters or quits by opening any lock in order to the committing of the house-trespass, or in order to the quitting of the house after a house-trespass.

132    In the circumstances, I was satisfied the Prosecution had established the elements of the housebreaking by night charge.

133    I accordingly found that both charges against Ridzuan (and Thava) had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

## Sentence

134    At the sentencing hearing for the two charges for which Ridzuan had been convicted of after trial, he pleaded guilty to three charges under s 147 Penal Code (“the rioting charge”), voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 Penal Code (“the hurt charge”) and use of abusive words under 3(1) Protection of Harassment Act (Cap 256A, 2015 Rev Ed) (“the abusive words charge”). The gang robbery, housebreaking by night and the rioting charges were committed while Ridzuan was subject to a remission order, and he was liable to be punished with an enhanced sentence under s 50T(1)(a) Prisons Act while the hurt and abusive words charges were committed when he was on bail.

135    The facts relating to the rioting, hurt and abusive words charges which Ridzuan admitted to without qualification were as follows:

### Facts relating to the rioting charge

136    The accomplices were:

> a.     Fahmi Bin Abdul Razak (“Fahmi”);

> b.     Muhammad Taufiq Bin Mohamed Haniffa (“Taufiq”), who is also known as “Tino”;

> c.     Nor Mohamad Azril Bin Sajali (“Azril”), who is also known as “Baby”;

> d.     Muhammad Farid Bin Abu (“Farid”), who is also known as “Fred”;

> e.     Nor Mohamad Azhairi Bin Sajali (“Azhairi”), who is also known as “M”;

> f.     Mohammed Faheez Bin Abdul Hamid (“Faheez”); and

> g.     Irsyad Sameer Bin Abdul Rahim (“Irsyad”), who is also known as “Boy Syad”.

137    Ridzuan and the accomplices, except Azhairi, were members of the Omega Secret Society of the Independent Group (“Omega”). Azhairi was aware that the others were from Omega.

138    The other involved parties were:

> a.     Johari Bin Sharif (“Johari”), also known as “Chubby”;

> b.     Muhammad Khairulanwar Bin Mohamed Sani (“the first deceased”), also known as “Starboy”; and

> c.     Nurul Filzah Syazwani Binte Abdul Rahim (“the second deceased”).

139    Johari, a senior member of the “Sio Kun Tong” Secret Society of the “18” Group that operated at Blk 143 Teck Whye Lane (“Teck Whye Lane”), had a dispute with one Danni Iskandar Bin Ahmad (“Danni”). Danni was also a member of Omega. Soon, other members of Omega, including Taufiq, also became involved in Danni’s dispute with Johari.

140    On 16 December 2017, Johari was at Club Baliza located at 6 Raffles Boulevard #0104 (“the Club”) with the two deceased persons and several others. Ridzuan and the accomplices were also in the same club.

141    After Ridzuan went out of the club to smoke, while Johari was inside the club, Azril approached him, asked him whether he had any problems with his “brother”, and punched Johari in the face. After Johari was punched, some of the accomplices approached Johari but they were stopped by the Club’s security staff from assaulting Johari.

142    Soon after Azril punched Johari, the security staff escorted the accomplices out of the Club. While outside the Club, sometime before 5.50am on the same day, one or more of them shouted aggressively and called out to Johari for a fight. They were preparing to attack Johari should he exit the Club. They later dispersed when Police officers arrived at the scene.

143    At about 5.50am on the same day, Ridzuan and the accomplices congregated at the driveway in front of Marina Square, 6 Raffles Boulevard, Singapore, outside a 7-11 store. They were chit-chatting amongst themselves when they spotted a white car had drove into the driveway and stopped. They suspected the white car contained members of Teck Whye Lane (_ie_, the secret society that Johari belonged to).

144    They then approached the white car, which had stopped at the end of the driveway. Ridzuan, Irsyad, Azril, Azhairi, Taufiq and Faheez surrounded the car. Azhairi was armed with a baseball bat at the material time. One or more of them tried to open the car doors and also hit and kicked the car, demanding that the occupants alight. This included Irsyad, who punched the side mirror of the car and Azril, who punched and kicked the car. The white car subsequently drove off. None of its occupants alighted.

145    The incident was captured by CCTV.

146    After the white car drove off, Ridzuan and the accomplices returned to their respective vehicles and left in search of the white car and other members of “Teck Whye Lane”. They drove around Marina Square in a convoy of cars.

147    Meanwhile, Johari and the two deceased persons were escorted out of the Club by the security officers. They went to the Marina Square car park and boarded the first deceased’s motor car bearing registration number SLB 1038H, a Silver Honda Civic (“the Silver Honda”).

148    The first deceased, who was driving the Silver Honda, then proceeded to Raffles Boulevard in the Silver Honda to pick up a friend. Three cars (driven by Ridzuan, Taufiq and Irsyad) which contained the accomplices then surrounded the Silver Honda at Raffles Boulevard.

149    The car driven by Irsyad, bearing registration number SJE 4666H, stopped in front of the Silver Honda, while the other two cars stopped at the side and at the rear, thereby surrounding the Silver Honda. Azril, who was in the car driven by Irsyad, also came out and kicked the door of the Silver Honda.

150    The first deceased was able to manoeuvre the Silver Honda through a gap between the cars and managed to flee from the scene. The convoy of cars then gave chase. They chased the Silver Honda from Marina Square down to Rochor Road and subsequently to Bukit Timah Road. They did so because they knew that Johari was inside the Silver Honda. The conduct of Ridzuan and the accomplices placed the occupants of the Silver Honda in a state of panic.

151    The first deceased then drove into Cavenagh Road. While along the road, Johari spotted uniformed Police officers and told the first deceased to turn in to seek help. The first deceased, who had consumed alcohol shortly before, then turned abruptly, causing the Silver Honda to crash into the gate of the rear of the Istana at 6.06 am on the same day.

152    The first and second deceased sustained serious injuries and subsequently passed away. Johari sustained a right orbital fracture, right fifth rib fracture with lung contusion, facial lacerations, and nasal septal fractures.

153    The incident outside Raffles Boulevard and part of the car-chase was captured by LTA cameras.

154    Ridzuan shared a common object with the accomplices to voluntarily cause hurt to Johari, and one or more of them had used violence in furtherance of the said common object by kicking the Silver Honda.

155    Ridzuan was arrested on 8 January 2018 and charged in court on 10 January 2018. He was subsequently released on court bail. While on court bail, Ridzuan committed the offences of hurt and use of abusive words.

### Facts pertaining to the hurt charge

156    The relevant parties were:

> a.     Chua Chuan Thye, male, aged 52 years, a Singapore Citizen (“Chuan Thye”); and

> b.     Chua Chuan Joo, male, aged 53 years old, a Singapore Citizen (“Chuan Joo”).

157    At the material time, Chuan Thye and Chuan Joo were running a family business, operating at 52 Ubi Avenue 3, Frontier Building, #01-40, Singapore 408867.

158    At the material time, Ridzuan was working as a deliveryman under the employment of DHL Express Singapore (“DHL”).

159    On 6 January 2021, at about 3.25pm, Ridzuan called the Police, stating “Painting. 2 person hit me. My van was blocking and he scold my father. I working DHL. He is here. He punch me.” The incident location was reported to be 52 Ubi Avenue 3, Frontier Building, #01-29, Singapore 408867 (“the Incident Location”).

160    On 6 January 2021, at about 3.21pm, Ridzuan drove his van and arrived outside the Incident Location. He then parked his van directly outside the unit, alighted, retrieved a parcel from his van and went to the unit to make a delivery.

161    At the material time, Chuan Joo was in a lorry which was parked directly behind Ridzuan’s van. As the Ridzuan’s van was blocking his way, Chuan Joo could not drive forward. When Chuan Joo sounded his horn to alert Ridzuan, Ridzuan gestured at him, requesting that he wait for him to complete his delivery.

162    However, Chuan Joo continued sounding his horn, and asked if the road belonged to the Ridzuan’s father. This prompted Ridzuan to approach him. Chuan Joo alighted from his lorry and confronted Ridzuan, asking if the road belonged to the Ridzuan’s father. An argument then ensued between the two of them.

163    At this juncture, Chuan Thye, who was in the vicinity, approached Chuan Joo and Ridzuan. All of a sudden, without saying a word, Chuan Thye punched Ridzuan on his face. Thereafter, Chuan Thye rained punches and kicks on Ridzuan, and Chuan Joo rained punches Ridzuan. As Ridzuan backed away from them, they chased after him and continued attacking him.

164    Chuan Thye and Chuan Joo stopped attacking Ridzuan after a passer-by intervened and separated the parties at about 3.23pm. Shortly after, Ridzuan called the Police.

165    While waiting for the Police’s arrival, at about 3.36pm, as Ridzuan felt angry about the earlier incident, he approached Chuan Thye. With the intention to cause hurt to Chuan Thye, Ridzuan punched him once on his face, thereby causing him bodily pain. Chuan Thye did not seek medical attention.

### Facts pertaining to the abusive words charge

166    The complainant is Tan Keng Hong, a 59-year-old male. At the material time, the complainant was working as a Safe Distancing Ambassador at DHL.

167    On 2 October 2020, at about 9.15am, while the complainant was doing his rounds as an ambassador at DHL’s company premises, which is located at 1 Greenwich Drive, Singapore 533865, he saw three Malay males, including Ridzuan, not wearing their masks. The complainant approached the group and told them to put on their masks.

168    Feeling angry at the manner in which the complainant spoke to the group, Ridzuan got into a heated exchange with the complainant. During their argument, Ridzuan shouted “puki mak”, which means “your mother’s cunt” in Malay, at the complainant. The complainant also shouted “fuck you” and “puki mak” to Ridzuan.

### Charges taken into consideration

169    Ridzuan consented to five charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. These were:

> (a)     Being a member of an unlawful assembly under s 143 Penal Code p/u s 50T(1)(a) Prisons Act;

> (b)     Being a member of an unlawful society s 14(3) Societies Act (Cap 311, 2014 Rev Ed) p/u s 50T(1)(a) Prisons Act;

> (c)     Rioting while armed with deadly weapon s 148 r/w ss 146 and 149 Penal Code p/u s 50T(1)(a) Prisons Act;

> (d)     Dangerous driving s 64(1) Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed); and

> (e)     Failure to wear mask under Reg 3A(1)(a) COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020 p/u s 34(7)(a) COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020.

### Antecedents

170    Ridzuan had unrelated antecedents for failing to remain indoors under s 33(1) Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Cap 67) and drug related antecedents for consumption of a specified drug under s 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185).

#### Prosecution’s submission on sentence

172    For the gang robbery charge, the Prosecution submitted that their proposed sentence for Ridzuan of 8 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane took reference from the sentences meted out on the three accomplices, namely Shanker, Juraimi and Azril.

> (a)     Shanker was sentenced to seven years’ and six months’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane for the gang robbery charge. Shanker had also pleaded guilty to other unrelated offences and the sentence for the gang robbery charge was made to run consecutively. He was given a total sentence of 10 years, 14 months, and 42 days’ imprisonment, and 24 strokes of the cane, with a disqualification from holding all classes of driving licences for a period of 18 months.

> (b)     Juraimi was sentenced to seven years’ and four months’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane for the gang robbery charge. He also pleaded guilty to two other unrelated offences and the sentence for the gang robbery charge was made to run consecutively. He was given a total sentence of seven years, four months, and two weeks’ imprisonment, and 12 strokes of the cane.

> (c)     Azril was sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane for the gang robbery charge. He also pleaded guilty to other unrelated offences and the sentence for gang robbery charge was made to run consecutively. He was given a total sentence of seven years’ and 36 months’ imprisonment, and 22 strokes of the cane. Azril appealed against the sentence and his appeal was dismissed.

173    The Prosecution submitted that Ridzuan’s culpability was most similar to Azril. Both acted under the directions of the masterminds, Shanker and Thava. At the same time, Azril had pleaded guilty to the offence prior to the commencement of the trial, demonstrating remorse and saving the court’s time and resources. Azril’s sentence of seven years’ imprisonment accordingly incorporated a sentencing discount afforded to him because of his plea of guilt. In the circumstances, the Prosecution submitted that a sentence of eight years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane should be meted out to Ridzuan given that there were no such mitigating factors present in Ridzuan’s case.

174    For the housebreaking by night charge, the Prosecution submitted that the following aggravating factors were present:

> (a)     Ridzuan had broken into a residential property where the complainants were residing at the material time and where they should reasonably expect that their privacy would not be invaded.

> (b)     Ridzuan committed housebreaking in order to commit an offence of gang-robbery. This was more egregious than if he had broken into the unit to annoy the victims.

> (c)     Ridzuan committed the offence with other accomplices.

175    The Prosecution submitted that usual tariff for an offence under s 456 Penal Code was between nine to 12 months’ imprisonment. The Prosecution submitted that on account of the aggravating factors set out above, a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment should be imposed

176    For the rioting charge, the Prosecution submitted the following aggravating factors were present:

> (a)     The circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence revealed a relentless assault and pursuit of the victims. First, the s 143 Penal Code offence (DAC-929430-2018) outside the Club, followed by the s 148 read with s 146 and s 149 Penal Code offence outside 7-11 (DAC-929432-2018) (both of which were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing), and ending with the proceeded rioting charge under s 147 read with s 146 Penal Code rioting offence near Raffles Boulevard.

> (b)     Whilst the Prosecution was not attributing liability for the deaths of the two deceased persons to Ridzuan and the other accomplices, their conduct had nevertheless resulted in the deceased persons being placed in a state of panic which eventually resulted in the crash. The only reason the deceased persons were driving in such a manner was because they sought to flee the accused persons’ assaults.

177    Two of the accomplices for the same charge under s 147 of the Penal Code, namely Fahmi and Azril, played a similar role to that played by Ridzuan in the present offence. Both pleaded guilty and were sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment.

178    The sentencing precedents for s 147 of the Penal Code showed that the sentenced ranged between 15 months’ imprisonment to 24 months’ imprisonment, with up to six strokes of the cane imposed. Ordinarily, the Prosecution submitted that it would have submitted for a sentence of at least 21 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane given the severity of the offence. However, in the light of the Prosecution’s submission for this sentence to run _consecutively_ with other sentences of imprisonment, the Prosecution had calibrated its sentencing position to 18 months’ imprisonment to account for the principle of totality.

179    For the hurt charge, the Prosecution submitted that whilst minor harm was caused to the victim, it submitted that the custodial threshold had been crossed and a short custodial term of one week’s imprisonment was warranted due to the following aggravating factors:

> (a)     Ridzuan committed this offence on 6 January 2021 whilst on court bail. His reoffending whilst on court bail is an aggravating factor which merits “enhanced sanctions to reflect the abuse of trust and the manifested proclivity for offending behaviour”: _PP v Loqmanul Hakim bin Buang_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR(R) 753</span> at \[61\].

> (b)     There were two violence-related charges which Ridzuan consented to being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing (under s 143 and s 148 of the Penal Code).

180    For the abusive words charge, the Prosecution submitted that the usual tariff for such an offence was a fine of between $1,000 to $2,000. The Prosecution submitted that a sentence higher than the usual tariff was warranted because the offence was committed whilst Ridzuan was on court bail and sought a fine of $3,000.

181    On the enhanced sentence under s 50T Prisons Act for the s 395 Penal Code charge, applying the sentencing guidelines set out by the High Court in _Abdul Mutalib bin Aziman v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 4 SLR 1220</span> (“_Abdul Mutalib”)_, the Prosecution submitted that Ridzuan’s breach fell in the middle of moderate severity. Applying the sentencing bands as set out at \[47\] of _Abdul Mutalib_ and submitted that Ridzuan should be sentenced to half of the remaining duration of his remission order (_ie_, 109 days), which was 55 days’ imprisonment.

182    The Prosecution did not seek enhanced sentences for the housebreaking by night and rioting charges.

183    The Prosecution submitted that the sentences for the gang robbery, rioting and hurt charges should run consecutively as these involved different victims and they violated separately legal protected interests.

184    The Prosecution submitted for a global sentence eight years, 18 months, one week’s imprisonment and an enhanced sentence of 55 days' imprisonment, with a $3,000 fine and 12 strokes of the cane.

#### Defence’s submission on sentence

185    For the gang robbery charge, the Defence referred to the case of _PP v Magesan s/o Ramasamy & ors_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 198</span> (“_Magesan_”), where the offenders had also impersonated police officers and wrongfully restrained the victims. More than $1.2 million was stolen from the victims. One of the offenders pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 8 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane for the gang robbery charge.

186    The Defence submitted in arriving at a sentence of seven years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes for Azril’s case, the court considered the fact that Azril had played an active role to hatch the plan about a month prior to the commission of the offence. Globally, there was also a significant level of premeditation and organisation that went into the planning of the robbery, with 12 separate individuals who were assigned roles and responsibilities as part of the criminal endeavour.

187    Defence counsel submitted that in Azril’s case, the court had taken the housebreaking charge into consideration in arriving at the sentence for the gang robbery. In the present case, Ridzuan has been convicted and would be sentenced to the housebreaking charge separately. Further, it was submitted that Juraimi and Azril were the ones who restrained the victims. In contrast, Ridzuan merely stood in the room at the time.

188    The Defence submitted that the sentence of eight years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes (excluding the enhanced punishment) sought by the Prosecution for Ridzuan was excessive as the offender in _Magesan_ had pleaded guilty to gang robbery of a sum of more than $1.2m, which was more than four times of the $300,000 stolen in the present case and had been sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. As such, the culpability of the offender in _Magesan’s_ case was far higher than Ridzuan’s. Using _Magesan’s_ eight years’ imprisonment term as a benchmark, there should be a downward adjustment afforded to Ridzuan. The Defence conceded that Ridzuan would not be able to avail himself of the sentencing discount given to Azril who had pleaded guilty. The Defence accordingly sought a sentence of seven years six month’s imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane which would be benchmarked against Juraimi’s sentence of seven years’ and four months’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. On the enhanced punishment under s 50T Prisons Act, the Defence sought for a sentence of 20 days’ imprisonment.

189    The Defence submission of 11 months’ imprisonment for the housebreaking by night charge. The Defence relied on the case of PP _v Tan Yan Chong_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 239</span> (“_Tan Yan Chong_”), where the court noted that the usual tariff for an offence of housebreaking which involves the invasion of a private home was nine to 12 months’ imprisonment. In _Tan Yan Chong_, the offender had climbed into the victim’s unit with the intention to annoy her and had tried to pry the doors open. The court was of the opinion that his culpability would fall within the midrange of the sentencing tariff. Nonetheless, given that he was a first time offender who had pleaded guilty, cooperated with the authorities and the offence took place over a short period of time, the court calibrated his sentence downwards to nine months’ imprisonment. In this vein, Defence submitted that while the quantum involved in the robbery was high and would necessarily have an impact on the sentence, this would still not warrant a sentence at the highest end of the tariff. As such, the Defence submitted that an imprisonment term of 11 months was appropriate in the circumstances.

190    The Defence submission on sentence for the rioting and the hurt charges was similar to that of the Prosecution, namely 18 months’ imprisonment and one week’s imprisonment. The Defence sought a fine of $1,000 for the abusive words charge. The Defence relied on the case of _PP v Lim Keng Tat_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGMC 80</span> (“_Lim Keng Tat_”), where the court noted that the fines awarded in cases involving abusive language typically ranged from $1,000 upwards. In _Lim Keng Tat_, the offender, whom the court noted was traced with three previous convictions for violent offences, was fined $2,000. He had used hurled multiple abusive Hokkien phrases at the victim.

191    In the present case, the Defence submitted that only one insult was shouted at the complainant. Further, there were other vulnerable individuals that were present during the verbal abuse in the case of _Lim Keng Tat_, which was not present here. At the same time, the Defence acknowledged that the fact that the victim was a Safe Distancing Ambassador would be an aggravating factor. All things considered, the Defence submitted that the culpability of the offender in _Lim Keng Tat_ was higher than the present case, and a fine of $1,000 would meet the ends of justice.

192    The Defence submitted that the imprisonment terms for the gang robbery and the rioting charges should run consecutively since they arose out of separate incidents. Notwithstanding that the hurt charge involved a different victim, the Defence submitted that the running of the for the gang robbery and the rioting imprisonment sentences consecutively adequately encompassed Ridzuan’s overall culpability and accorded with the totality principle and accordingly the imprisonment term on the hurt charge could run concurrently. In this vein, the Defence submitted that the gang robbery and the rioting sentences were the highest of the sentences that Ridzuan would receive.

193    The Defence’s global sentence would be seven years, 24 months’ imprisonment, and an enhanced sentence of 20 days' imprisonment, with a $1,000 fine and 12 strokes of the cane.

### The court’s decision on sentence

194    The main areas of difference between the Prosecution and the Defence in the submission on sentence was with regard to the gang robbery and the use of abusive word charges, and to a lesser extent on the housebreaking by night charge.

195    For the gang robbery charge, both the Prosecution and the Defence agreed that parity with the sentences imposed on the accomplices were important and relevant. I agreed with this position as it was in accordance with the often cited decision of _PP v Ramlee_ \[1998\] 3 SLR (R) 95 where Yong CJ stated at \[7\]:

> Where two or more offenders are to be sentenced for participation in the same offence, the sentences passed on them should be the same, unless there is a relevant difference in their responsibility for the offence or their personal circumstances … An offender who has received a sentence that is significantly more severe than has been imposed on his accomplice, and there being no reason for the differentiation, is a ground of appeal if the disparity is serious. This is even where the sentences viewed in isolation are not considered manifestly excessive: see _R v Walsh_ (1980) 2 Cr App R (S) 224. In _R v Fawcett_ (1983) 5 Cr App R (S) 158, Lawton LJ held that the test was whether ‘right thinking members of the public, with full knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, learning of this sentence consider that something had gone wrong with the administration of justice?

196    Both the Prosecution and Defence also agreed that in terms of culpability, Ridzuan’s culpability was closer to Azril whereas Thava and Shanker had higher culpability as they were involved in formulating the plan. Taking Azril’s sentence of seven years’ imprisonment as the reference point, it should be noted that Azril’s sentence already factored in a discount on account of his having pleaded guilty the charge.

197    As such, if Ridzuan and Azril were of the same level of culpability, given that Ridzuan had claimed trial, his sentence would not reflect any sentencing discount and must necessarily be higher than that of Azril. The Defence conceded as much and had submitted for a sentence of seven years and six months’ imprisonment. In my view, the Defence’s submission of a sentence of seven years and six months’ imprisonment for Ridzuan did not adequately reflect the sentencing discount afforded to Azril. Ridzuan’s trial lasted 20 days with a total of 14 witnesses. Azril’s plea of guilt had saved significant resources and court time and his sentence of seven years’ imprisonment would have reflected this. As such, I was of the view that using seven years’ imprisonment as a reference point which would have incorporated a sentencing discount for Azril’s plea of guilt, a sentence of eight years’ imprisonment and the mandatory 12 strokes of the cane was an appropriate sentence for Ridzuan in the circumstances. Turning to _Magesan’s_ case relied on by the Defence counsel where the offender received eight years’ imprisonment for what was a higher amount stolen, this was in fact an adjusted sentence as the District Judge in _Magesan_ observed at \[144\] as there were other robbery and attempted robbery charges. The offender in fact was sentenced to a total of 10 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane and this was to achieve parity with the other offenders. Further, with regard to the amount of 1.2 million that was stolen in _Magesan_, a substantial amount of $900,000 was recovered whereas in the present case only $5,500 was recovered.

198    For the housebreaking charge, as noted by the Defence in _Tan Yan Chong_, the usual tariff for an offence of housebreaking which involved the invasion of a private home was nine to 12 months’ imprisonment. In this regard, I agreed with the Prosecution that a sentence at the higher end of the tariff was warranted as Ridzuan had broken into a residential property with accomplices to commit gang robbery in the early hours of the morning. I accordingly imposed a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment for the housebreaking charge.

199    For the rioting charge, parity was a relevant factor and two of the co-accused persons, Fahmi and Azril, who played a similar role to that played by Ridzuan, had pleaded guilty and were each sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment. As Ridzuan had pleaded guilty to this charge, I saw no reason to depart from the sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment which had been meted out to Fahmi and Azril and I accordingly impose the same on Ridzuan.

200    For the hurt charge, both parties agreed that the custodial threshold had been crossed and a short custodial term of one week’s imprisonment was warranted.

201    Specifically, I noted the following aggravating factors:

> (a)     Ridzuan committed this offence on 6 January 2021 whilst on court bail.

> (b)     There were two violence-related charges which Ridzuan consented to being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing (under s 143 and s 148 of the Penal Code).

202    I accordingly imposed a sentence of one weeks’ imprisonment. Such a short custodial sentence fell within Band 1 of the sentencing framework as set out in _Low Song Chye v PP_ \[2019\] SLR 526 with the custodial threshold having been crossed on account of the aggravating factors I have set out above.

203    For the abusive words charge, both parties agreed that a fine was appropriate. The Prosecution submitted for a fine of $3,000 whilst the defence submitted for a fine of $1,000. In _Lim Keng Tat_, the court noted that fines awarded in cases where abusive language was used typically ranged from $1,000 upwards. In _Lim Keng Tat_, the offender had hurled multiple abusive Hokkien phrases at the victim and was traced with three previous convictions for violent offences and was fined $2,000.

204    In the current case, given that the offence was committed whilst Ridzuan was on court bail and was directed at a Safe Distancing Ambassador after the latter had told Ridzuan to put on his mask (where Ridzuan’s failure to wear a mask Section 34(7) of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020 was one the charges taken into consideration), I was of the view that these were aggravating factors and a fine above the normal tariff of $1,000 was warranted. All things considered; I imposed a fine of $2,000 in default one week‘s imprisonment.

205    On the enhanced sentence under s 50T(1)(a) Prisons Act, the Prosecution only sought for an enhanced sentence for the gang robbery charge. Applying the sentencing guidelines set out by the High Court _Abdul Mutalib_ , I agreed with the Prosecution that Ridzuan’s breach fell in the middle of moderate severity as the offence of gang robbery that had been committed by Ridzuan was a serious one but was dissimilar to the offences for which the remission order had been made. Further the gang robbery had been committed on 11 December 2017, slightly more than mid-way of the remission order, his remission order being from 3 August 2017 to 29 March 2018.

206    Applying the sentencing bands as set out at \[47\] of _Abdul Mutalib_ with breach of moderate severity, he should be sentenced to half of the remaining duration of his remission order (109 days), which was 55 days’ imprisonment. As the Prosecution (and the Defence) did not submit for an enhanced sentence for the housebreaking and rioting charges and given that any such enhanced sentence would necessarily run consecutively with other sentences of imprisonment, on the basis of totality I did not impose any enhanced sentence for these two offences.

207    The sentences for the gang robbery, rioting and hurt charges should run consecutively as they involved different victims and violated separately legal protected interests- see _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> (“_Shouffee_”) at \[30\].

208    The sentences I imposed on Ridzuan were accordingly as follows:

209    The total sentence was eight years, 18 months and one week's imprisonment and an enhanced sentence of 55 days' imprisonment, 12 strokes of the cane and a fine of $2,000, in default one week's imprisonment. In my view, this total sentence would adequately reflect the overall criminality of Ridzuan’s conduct without being unduly crushing on him.

210    Ridzuan is on bail pending his appeal.
