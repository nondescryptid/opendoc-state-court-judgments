Contract – Misrepresentation

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in HC/DCA 4/2022.\]

26 April 2022

### District Judge Dorothy F M Ling:

## Introduction**[^1]**

1       This was the plaintiff’s claims which included a return of monies amounting to S$70,000, a declaration that the contract between the parties had rescinded, and damages. The plaintiff claimed to have been induced by the defendant to part with the S$70,000 upon a misrepresentation by the defendant.

2       I dismissed the plaintiff’s claim as I considered that the plaintiff had neither proven the terms of the representation, nor discharged his burden of proving the alleged misrepresentation. The plaintiff was dissatisfied with my decision and had lodged an appeal.

## Facts

### The background

3       The plaintiff and defendant were friends and classmates before.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2)

4       On 2 August 2012, the defendant incorporated a Singapore-registered company known as Taste Reminiscence Pte Ltd (“TR”) and was its director. One year later, on 1 August 2013, the plaintiff was appointed TR’s other director.

5       About May 2013, which was a few months prior to the plaintiff becoming TR’s director, the defendant had shared with the plaintiff TR’s business ideas and investment plans. These were about starting coffee-brewing cafés in China. The plaintiff became interested, and paid a total amount of S$70,000 into TR’s account. He wanted to participate in the venture.

6       When the plaintiff did not receive anything in return for his S$70,000, the plaintiff commenced this suit against the defendant.

### The plaintiff’s case

7       It was the plaintiff’s case that he was induced to “enter into a contract with the Defendant”[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) by the defendant’s presentation of TR’s business plan The plaintiff alleged that the defendant represented the following to him:-[^4]

> (a)     that in consideration for S$70,000, the plaintiff would be given 10% shares in each of two China-incorporated companies: Gaoxin District Arabica Coffee Shop (“Gaoxin”) and Wenjiang Arabica Coffee (“Wenjiang”);

> (b)     that Gaoxin and Wenjiang were to be 100% subsidiaries of TR;

> (c)     that TR would be acquiring the “Arabica” brand and the plaintiff would receive 20% of all profits from every outlet of the Arabica brand in China within 1 year from the acquisition from about September 2013 onwards; and

> (d)     the defendant, being TR’s director and sole shareholder, would be in a position to ensure that the plaintiff would receive the 10% shares of Gaoxin and Wenjiang.

(These are to be collectively referred to as “the Representations”.)

8       Claiming to have been induced by and acting in reliance on the representation, the plaintiff parted with a total of S$70,000 which he deposited into TR’s bank account in two tranches. The first tranche of payment of S$40,000 was made on 8 July 2013, and the second one of S$30,000 was made on 6 August 2013.

9       It is not disputed that the S$70,000 was subsequently withdrawn by the defendant. It was the plaintiff’s understanding that a portion of the first S$40,000 was used by the defendant to purchase the defendant’s 51% shareholding in one Arabica Food and Beverage Management (Chongqing) Co. Ltd. (“Arabica Chongqing”).[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5) The share transfer agreement for this transaction was between the seller – one Tan Pu (or Roland) – and the defendant.

10     When the plaintiff failed to receive the shares of Gaoxin and Wenjiang or any profit, he carried out checks and discovered, amongst other information, that –

> (a)     the share transfer agreement from Arabica Chongqing did not take effect;

> (b)     TR did not acquire the shares of Gaoxin and Wenjiang. These companies were in fact in the name of one Zou Yu; and

> (c)     Wenjiang no longer existed since 11 August 2016.

11     In short, for his S$70,000 the plaintiff received neither shares in any company, nor profit of either 10% or 20%.

### The defendant’s case

12     The defendant denied[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) that he made the alleged representations to the plaintiff, except that he did mention that the two cafés would be opened. For ease of doing business in China, the two cafés would be in the name of one Zou Yu,[^7] a China national. The plaintiff was to contribute S$70,000 into TR. TR would then, in turn, invest in the opening of the cafés. If this was successful, more cafés would be opened.

13     According to the defendant, the plaintiff was introduced and met up with Zou Yu in China. It was also not denied by the plaintiff that he was at the opening of the café or that he reviewed the China business, “talked to everybody” or spent weeks in China.[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8)

14     However, the business failed. According to the defendant, that was when the plaintiff started to pursue the defendant for the return of the S$70,000, alleging misrepresentation and that the defendant had “conned his money”[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9).

## Issues to be determined and the burden of proof

15     The issues that the court needed to determine were questions of fact and law. They were –

> (a)     what were the representations that were made to the plaintiff;

> (b)     whether they were misrepresentations.

16     This Court was mindful that the the legal burden always remained with the plaintiff to prove his case on a balance of probabilities. However, the evidential burden might shift between the parties.

17     The Court had first to determine what were represented to the plaintiff by the defendant before deciding whether what were presented were misrepresentations.

## Decision

18     In her closing submissions, plaintiff’s counsel stated in clear terms that the plaintiff’s claim was “in misrepresentation, innocent, negligent or fraudulent, and also in restitution…”.[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10) However, this did not come out quite as clearly in the pleadings. Nevertheless, the defendant and his counsel knew the case that they had to meet.

19     As the plaintiff’s case emphasised fraudulent misrepresentation, I can do no better than to quote the law as set out by the Court of Appeal in _Panatron Pte Ltd and another v Lee Cheow Lee and another_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] SGCA 49</span> (“_Panatron_’s case”) at \[14\], which case plaintiff’s counsel had helpfully included in her Bundle of Authorities.[^11] The case sets out the five essential elements of a misrepresentation:

> **First**, there must be a representation of fact made by words or conduct. **Second**, the representation must be made with the intention that it should be acted upon by the plaintiff, or by a class of persons which includes the plaintiff. **Third**, it must be proved that the plaintiff had acted upon the false statement. **Fourth**, it must be proved that the plaintiff suffered damage by so doing. **Fifth**, the representation must be made with knowledge that it is false; it must be wilfully false, or at least made in the absence of any genuine belief that it is true. (My emphases.)

20     As mentioned earlier, it was a question of fact for every misrepresentation that the plaintiff alleged against the defendant, that the representation was made, and that it was made by the defendant to the plaintiff in the terms alleged to have been so made. Notably, the plaintiff had stated the representations with some level of specificity.

21     The difficulty with the plaintiff’s case is that the representations alleged to have been made were made orally, apparently during a meeting between the plaintiff and the defendant sometime in May 2013 and perhaps stretching to July 2013, as mentioned by the defendant’s counsel in his closing submissions.[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12) The Court therefore only had the plaintiff’s testimonies – both written and oral – of the representations.

22     The plaintiff was unable to present to the Court in clear terms what were the representations that were made to him. In his evidence, the plaintiff claimed that he understood that his S$70,000 would allow him to get, _inter alia_, 10% shares in Gaoxin and 10% shares in Wenjiang. He never received any shares in the two companies. According to the defendant, however, the plaintiff was only to receive “10% stakes”[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13) in Gaoxin and Wenjiang. What the plaintiff invested his S$70,000 in was one of TR’s projects in China. It is the Court’s understanding from the defendant’s testimony that of the profit that TR would get from Gaoxin and Wenjiang, the plaintiff would receive 10% of it.[^14] It was therefore the defendant’s case that the plaintiff was never meant to receive 10% shareholding in Gaoxin and Wenjiang. The defendant therefore denied having made the alleged representation to the plaintiff.

23     To add to the confusion, in his oral testimony, the plaintiff claimed that he was supposed to have received shares of three companies and not just Gaoxin and Wenjiang.[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15) The third company was to be one Arabica Franchising Management (China).[^16] The plaintiff subsequently explained that he did not include this company as he did not have the evidence earlier.[^17]

24     Another instance where the plaintiff was unclear in what was represented to him was when the plaintiff, under cross-examination, tried to explain the alleged misrepresentation of the acquisition of Gaoxin and Wenjiang by TR. It was the plaintiff’s case that TR was to acquire 100% shares in Gaoxin and Wenjiang. However, in his oral testimony, the plaintiff said that –[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18)

> the Defence _(sic)_ told me that he would need to get his another company… Kubi Food and Beverage Management to purchase… the Arabica Food and Beverage Management. Thereafter he would then transfer his shares over to me…

This was never raised in the plaintiff’s pleadings, and only revealed during cross-examination. So, just what exactly was the plaintiff alleging that the defendant represented to him?

25     It therefore appeared to the Court that the plaintiff tailored his story according to what evidence he was able to dig up or what he could make up along the way. It even seemed that the plaintiff himself could not be certain what was represented to him.

26     Although it would appear too convenient a shield for the defendant’s case, it was the defendant’s explanation that they lost money in this venture.[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19) The defendant claimed that he invested more than the plaintiff into the coffee business, and so, lost more. Besides that –[^20]

> “I’ve invested my life, my time, I’m doing all the work there, and he is like just on the phone, on chats, just---just commanding me, asking me this, that and things.”

And then, like schoolboys, the defendant referred to the plaintiff as a “sore loser”.[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21)

27     That was why the plaintiff appeared to have received nothing for his investment. However, the defendant had testified, and it was not refuted, that the plaintiff had the opportunity to manage the Arabica business in China as an investor, and was regarded as a ‘management figure’ of Gaoxin and Wenjiang. He had “visibility”.[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22) There was also the obligation to report to the plaintiff how the investment was performing.[^23] The plaintiff even participated, gave his opinion, and “boss\[ed\] people around”.[^24] The plaintiff therefore enjoyed the trappings of an investor.

28     On the issue therefore, this Court had to decide if the defendant had, in fact and in truth, made the misrepresentations to the plaintiff to induce him into the venture. That was what was crucial for this court. However, except for the plaintiff’s word on it – which, as mentioned earlier, was also rather garbled – the Court was unable to get any objective or clear evidence that the alleged representations were indeed made, and in the terms that the plaintiff had set out in his Statement of Claim.

29     I repeat myself when I state that the defendant’s case was that any representation made to the plaintiff was that he would have stakes in Gaoxin and Wenjiang. If there was profit, the plaintiff would receive 10% of the companies’ profits, or 20% of the Arabica profit. As it turned out, from the evidence of both parties, the Court accepted that the China coffee business did not thrive. There was no profit gained from the businesses. It was not a profitable venture.

30     It was not refuted that the plaintiff himself was well aware of the plight of the China companies. This was evident from his messages with the defendant.[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25) Besides, the plaintiff was himself a director of TR, with access to TR’s records and accounts, even if he were not a shareholder. It was also not disputed by the plaintiff that he had access to all accounts, including Gaoxin and Wenjiang’s. The plaintiff also appeared to be contented to go along with whatever arrangement was ‘agreed’ between the parties – that is, that he would get his returns upon the companies making profit – until he realised that the investment was going downhill.[^26]

31     If there was any inducement, it would be by the defendant’s alleged projection or opinion that this venture was viable and profitable, except that the projection was wrong. Even then, on a balance of probabilities, I was not persuaded that the defendant would have informed the plaintiff categorically that he could expect to draw down on profits within a year. But, that was what the plaintiff alleged the defendant had represented to him.

32     When pointedly put to the defendant that the plaintiff had received nothing from TR, the defendant, Gaoxin or Wenjiang, the defendant agreed. The defendant confirmed that the plaintiff “did not receive anything from a certificate perspective”.[\[note: 27\]](#Ftn_27) That was not the arrangement after all, according to the defendant.

33     The defendant therefore refuted the plaintiff’s allegations of the representations.

34     This would have been an easier case to decide if the defendant’s case was stronger. However, as plaintiff’s counsel clearly recognised, there were weaknesses in the defendant’s case. Plaintiff’s counsel, in fact, spent a large proportion of her closing submissions showing the defence up when it would have been better for the plaintiff to build his case up.

35     As counsel would know, regardless of how bad the defence is, the plaintiff must still prove his case on a balance of probabilities. On this, I borrow from Steven Chong J in _Goldrich Venture Pte Ltd and another_ v _Halcyon Offshore Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 103</span> at \[75\] and \[78\] where the learned Judge said:

> … both parties’ narratives are riddled with difficulties.

> …

> …\[T\]he difficulties in the defendant’s narrative, however numerous, do not assist the plaintiffs with the proof of its affirmative case. I am not faced with a binary choice between accepting either the plaintiff’s account of events or that of the defendant’s. In other words, rejection of the defendant’s case theory does not invariably entail acceptance of the plaintiff’s.

36     As far as evidence went in this case, I was not persuaded on a balance of probabilities the very first element of a misrepresentation – that there was a representation in the terms the plaintiff had alleged was made.

37     If the plaintiff would invest an amount such as S$70,000 into a business, it would be reasonable to expect him to first do his due diligence. However, in _Pantron’s_ case, at \[24\], the Court of Appeal had held that –

> … it is no defence that the \[respondents\] acted incautiously and failed to take those steps to verify the truth of the representations which a prudent man would have taken… .

Likewise, I would like to put on record that in the present case, this Court had also not held it against the plaintiff for not having performed due diligence, because, it is this Court’s holding that there was no such representations made as alleged.

## Conclusion

38     As I considered that the plaintiff had not successfully crossed the foundational factual hurdle of proving the first element of misrepresentation – that there was a representation of the fact alleged to have been made, by words or conduct – the plaintiff’s case must fail.

39     I invited counsel to submit on costs. Upon both counsel’s oral submissions on costs, I awarded costs in favour of the defendant.
