Criminal Law – Voluntarily Causing Hurt – Common Intention

Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9058/2022/01.\]

15 June 2022

### District Judge Kok Shu-en:

## Introduction

1       The accused is a 47 year old Singaporean male who claimed trial to a single charge for the offence of voluntarily causing hurt with common intention under section 323 read with section 34 of the Penal Code, Cap 224. The charge read as follows:

> You… are charged that you, sometime on or around 8.28 pm on the 22 October 2020, at an open area near Blk 103 Gangsa Road Singapore 670103, together with K D Chandran S/O K R Dorai Rai and Logeswaran S/O Rajagopal (“Loges”), and in furtherance of the common intention of all of you, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Kalvaldip Singh S/O Jagit Singh (“Kalvaldip”), to wit, you three repeatedly punched the said Kalvaldip on his face and body, and Loges hit Kalvaldip with a plastic chair, causing Kalvaldip to suffer bodily pain, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 323 read with Section 34 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

2       At the conclusion of the trial, I convicted the accused on the charge and sentenced him to 4 weeks’ imprisonment.

3       The accused has filed an appeal against both the conviction and the sentence imposed.

## Facts

### The Prosecution’s case

4       The events that took place on 22 October 2020 were largely undisputed. This was unsurprising as the altercation that was the subject matter of the charge was captured in its entirety on CCTV footage retrieved from a camera located at the incident location (P3).

5       In the CCTV footage, the victim can be seen entering the frame first, followed by three persons – it was undisputed that these were the accused, K D Chandran s/o K R Dorai Rai (“KD”) and Logeswaran S/O Rajagopal (“Loges”)[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1). The accused was seen in the footage walking just behind KD and Loges. The three co-accused persons are seen catching up with the victim, and as the victim turns to face them, the co-accused persons start to hit and punch him (time stamp 0:00:08). All three co-accused continue to punch the victim at the same time. A few seconds into the assault, the person identified as Loges in the footage is seen holding a plastic chair and hitting the victim with it (time stamp 0:00:17), while the other two continue to hit and punch the victim with their hands.

6       About 20 seconds after the hitting and punching of the victim began, the accused is seen on the footage walking away from the victim (time stamp 0:00:28), though the other two co-accused persons can be seen continuing with the attack of the victim. At no point in the footage is the victim seen retaliating or attacking any of the other three persons.

7       The police officer who was dispatched to the scene to attend to the incident (PW2) observed injuries on the victim and took photographs of these (P6) and was informed by the victim that he had been assaulted by three people.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) A doctor from Ng Teng Fong General Hospital (P3) who examined the victim on 27 October 2020, about 5 days after the incident, diagnosed him to be suffering from multiple contusions. The doctor could not say for certain what had caused the injuries, though he said, “_it does look like it was probably a blunt object that hit him_”[^3].

8       Following the evidence of the doctor, the Prosecution applied to amend the charge to replace the words “_suffer multiple contusions_” with “_suffer bodily pain_”. The Defence did not object to the application, and I allowed the amendment. The accused maintained his plea of not guilty on the amended charge. No application was made to recall any of the witnesses who had already testified, and the victim himself had yet to be called to the stand at this point in the proceedings.

9       The victim (PW6) and Loges (PW7) were called as witnesses, though KD was not produced as a witness, having absconded mid-way through criminal proceedings against him and could not be located. The statement that he had made during investigations (P15) was admitted into evidence pursuant to section 32(1)(j)(ii) of the Evidence Act, Cap 97.

10     The victim stated that he knew these three individuals as “KD”, “Berd” and “Loges”[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4), and identified the accused as “Berd”[^5]. He said that he had known of KD and the accused prior to 22 October 2020 but had only met Loges on the day of the incident. During cross-examination, the victim admitted that he had made a phone call to a ‘Chinese gangster’ and passed the phone to the accused and another person known as ‘Mike’[^6], though he denied using vulgar language against them or that he had threatened violence against them with the aid of this ‘Chinese gangster’. He testified that when the accused and the two other co-accused persons hit and punched him, he felt pain.[^7]

11     Prior to testifying in court, Loges had pleaded guilty to a charge under section 323 read with section 34 of the Penal Code in relation to this incident and had been sentenced to 6 weeks’ imprisonment on this charge (P17). He testified to having been in a fight “_because that guy came to our table, he challenge us and say he got people behind_”.[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8) He said that KD was his friend, and while he did not identify the accused by name he was able to identify the accused as one of the assailants in the video footage.[^9]

### Close of the Prosecution’s case

12     The Defence did not make any submission of no case to answer at the close of the Prosecution’s case. Having the heard the evidence led by the Prosecution, I was satisfied that a _prima facie_ case had been made out on the charge and accordingly I called upon the accused to enter his defence.

### The Defence’s case

13     The accused was the sole witness for the Defence.

14     The Defence did not dispute that there had been an altercation among the victim and the three co-accused person and admitted that he had punched the victim. According to the accused, there had been a dispute prior to the altercation and that the victim had used vulgarities against him, KD and Loges. In particular, the accused said that the victim’s use of vulgarities with reference to his mother agitated him[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10) and he walked towards the victim but did not call for KD or Loges to join him, emphasising that he went on his own.

15     As the accused had a leg injury, his pace of walking was slow, and KD and Loges eventually caught up with him. The accused claimed that KD and Loges “_went on their own account_” and that he had gone on his own account.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11) In other words, the Defence’s case was that each of the three co-accused persons had acted independently of their own accord and that there was no common intention to cause hurt to the victim.

## Analysis of the evidence

16     For the charge to be established in this case, the Prosecution would have to prove beyond reasonable doubt the following elements:

(a)

The accused shared a common intention with KD and Loges to voluntarily cause hurt to the victim; and

(b)

In furtherance of the common intention, all three co-accused persons punched the victim on the face and body and Loges hit the victim with a plastic chair.

### Voluntarily causing hurt

17     Section 321 of the Penal Code defines “voluntarily causing hurt” as the doing of “_any act with the intention of thereby causing hurt to any person, or with the knowledge that he is likely thereby to cause hurt to any person, and does thereby cause hurt to any person_”. The term “hurt” is defined at section 319 of the Penal Code as “_bodily pain, disease or infirmity_”.

18     There was no serious contention by the Defence that the accused, Loges and KD did voluntarily cause hurt to the victim by punching him, or that Loges hit the victim by using a plastic chair. This much was clear from the CCTV footage of the incident, as well as the testimonies of the victim[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12) and Loges[^13]. The accused also accepted that he had punched the victim, and while he initially tried to take the position that he “_just wanted to hit him_” and did not know “_whether to cause pain or not_”[^14], he eventually accepted that he did punch the victim in order to cause hurt to the victim.

19     In their closing submissions, the Defence argued that the harm in this case was slight and therefore should not be considered an offence pursuant to section 95 of the Penal Code, arguing that it was doubtful whether the punches that the accused threw caused bodily pain to the victim.

20     The threshold for section 95 to be invoked is harm that is so slight that no person of ordinary sense and temper would complain of such harm. The victim was clear in his testimony that he felt pain because of the blows that he received from the three attackers[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15) and when he was hit with the chair.[^16] He also said that he was fearful of being attacked again in the aftermath of the incident.[^17] It was also evident from the CCTV footage that the three attackers – including the accused – were not punching the victim lightly, but with some force such that it would not be surprising that the victim would feel pain. In fact, at one point in the footage, the victim could be seen falling to the ground just after the accused had hit him (time stamp 0:00:27).

21     Accordingly, I did not think that the harm caused was so trivial and slight that a person of ordinary sense or temper would not complain of the harm and disagreed with the Defence that the threshold for section 95 had been met in this case.

### Common intention

22     The focus of the defence in this case was the denial of any common intention to cause hurt between the accused, KD and Loges.

23     In _Daniel Vijay s/o Katherasan and others v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 4 SLR 1119</span>, the Court of Appeal held at \[107\] that “_the criminal act done by the actual doer which resulted in the offence charged would be considered to be done in furtherance of the common intention of all the offenders only if that common intention included an intention to commit the very criminal act done by the actual doer_”.

24     In _Arumugam Selvaraj v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 881</span>, the High Court noted at \[10\] that the degree of specificity required of the intention of the secondary offender is “_dictated by the primary offence, and the actus reus specified for the primary offender_”. Where the offence is cause one of a class of injuries, the Court held that it is not necessary for there to be a common intention to cause the specific injury that is covered by the charge, and that it would be sufficient for the Prosecution to show that there was a common intention to cause an injury falling within the class of injuries covered by the penal provision.

25     The Court of Appeal in _Shaiful Edham bin Adam and another v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 1 SLR(R) 442</span> cautioned at \[58\] that a common intention is not the same as having the same or similar intention, but rather a prior meeting of the minds. It was also held in the same case at \[60\] that the absence of a pre-conceived plan is not a bar to a finding of common intention, and that the “_pre-arrangement need not existing in the sense of a prior plan. The plan could develop on the spot_”. The Court of Appeal held that “_\[s\]ince it would in most cases be virtually impossible to prove a pre-arranged plan, failure to do so is of no consequence. Instead, “common intention” is to be inferred from all the facts and circumstances of the case, including the conduct of the accused_.”

26     There was no evidence before me that there had been any discussion or pre-planning among the three co-accused persons that they would assault the victim. The accused claimed that he walked towards the victim but did not invite KD or Loges to follow him and did not know why they had done so[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18), and that he had acted alone in his assault of the victim. In Loges’ testimony, there was also no mention of any discussion among the co-accused persons, and simply stated that he had been angry at the victim and had followed him to start a fight and noticed that other people were also engaged in a fight with the victim at the same time.[^19]

27     Nevertheless, based on the evidence of the circumstances leading to the assault, as well as the conduct of the accused, KD and Loges throughout the incident, I found that it could be inferred that the three of them shared a common intention to cause hurt to the victim for the following reasons.

28     First, the accused, KD and Loges had been in each other’s company on the day of the incident, where they had been seated outside the provision shop near the scene of the incident where they had been drinking together since the afternoon.[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20) While Loges was ambivalent in his evidence about knowing the accused, it was clear from the testimony of the accused that they were acquainted with each other.[^21] In fact, according to the accused they remained in each other’s company even after the incident, having adjourned to KD’s residence to continue drinking.[^22] In other words, the three of them were not a random collection of strangers who did not know each other prior to the incident.

29     Second, before the physical altercation took place, an argument had taken place between the victim and the co-accused persons. It was undisputed that the victim made a phone call to a Chinese gangster known as ‘Ah Neh’ on the line first to the accused and later tried to pass the phone to one Mike, who did not want to speak to ‘Ah Neh’[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23). Arising from this incident, the accused said he was angered by vulgarities and threatening words that the victim uttered.[^24] Loges had also been angered because the victim “_keep coming back with a phone video call_” and that “_he say “If somebody want to challenge us for a fight,” He say he standby_”.[^25] The statement given by KD (P15) also contained portions to similar effect: “_Singh approached us with his phone, saying that he called the Chinese people. He was very aggressive, which made us not very happy._”

30     Arising from this argument, the accused, KD and Loges had been angry and upset with the victim just before the altercation took place. The accused gave evidence to this effect[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26), as did Loges[^27]. The victim also recalled that the three co-accused persons had been angry with him and in the moments before the attack started[^28], and that “_\[he\] knew that they were going to hit \[him\]_”[^29]. In other words, the accused, Loges and KD had all been angry with the victim over the same incident and while this alone does not in itself prove that they must have shared a common intention to hurt the victim, it does point toward a unity of purpose in seeking retaliation against the victim.

31     Third, in the CCTV footage, the accused, KD and Loges are seen walking toward the victim together before they start hitting the victim at around the same time. The accused claims that he had started walking towards the victim first, and that he did not realise that the other two had followed him until they overtook him. Even if this were the case, it is clear that once they had caught up with him, all three continued to proceed towards the victim together. Their movement in concert towards the victim in the immediate aftermath of the interaction with the victim that had angered them points towards a common intention to retaliate against the victim by causing hurt to him.

32     Fourth, the accused, KD and Loges took turns hitting and punching the victim in quick succession, which sustained over a period of about 20 seconds before the accused walked away from the scene. This sustained joint attack against the victim is again indicative of a common intention among them to cause hurt to the victim. During this period, Loges used a plastic chair to hit the victim. Even though it was not the accused who did this act, I was of the view that it was an act that fell within the common intention that the three co-accused persons shared to cause hurt to the victim.

33     In my view, the fact that the accused left before the other two co-accused persons completed their attack on the victim also does not preclude there being a common intention during the earlier portion of the attack that the accused had participated in. Had the accused walked away at any point before the altercation, or immediately after it had started, such an argument may have carried more weight. However, he did not walk away until 20 seconds after the attack started, and only after he, KD and Loges had punched the victim repeatedly, and after Loges had used a plastic chair to hit the victim.

34     Given the circumstances of the incident and how the accused had acted together with the other two after having been angered by the victim together, the Defence’s contention that the three co-accused persons each formed their own agenda against the victim after being separately angered by him simply did not accord with the evidence.

35     Taking these circumstances together, I was satisfied that the accused did share a common intention with KD and Loges to cause hurt to the victim, and that in furtherance of that common intention, the three of them punched the victim and Loges hit the victim with a plastic chair. As a result of these acts, the victim suffered bodily pain.

## Decision on the charge

36     Having considered the evidence before me and for the reasons I have set out above, I was satisfied that the Prosecution proved the charge beyond reasonable doubt, and I convicted the accused on the charge.

## Antecedents

37     The accused was traced with antecedents, the earliest of which was from 1993. According to the antecedent record tendered by the Prosecution, the accused was convicted for an offence under section 323 of the Penal Code in 1999 and imprisoned for 2 weeks. The accused disputed this antecedent record, and as the Prosecution was not able to verify this record with the prison authorities, they did not seek to rely on it and removed reference to this specific record from their sentencing submissions.

38     The accused did not dispute the remaining records, which included a fine of $2,000 for an offence of disorderly behaviour in 2000. His most recent set of convictions prior to this matter was in 2006, where he was convicted on a charge of ill-treatment of a child or young person. One similar charge and two additional charges under section 323 of the Penal Code were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

## Sentencing

39     Under section 323 of the Penal Code, the offence of voluntarily causing hurt is punishable with up to 3 years imprisonment, or with fine of up to $5,000, or with both.

40     In _Low Song Chye v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 140</span>, the High Court prescribed three broad sentencing bands providing indicative sentencing ranges based on the hurt caused by the offence, which apply to first time offenders who plead guilty to the offence under section 323 of the Penal Code.

41     Under this framework, the sentencing court is to:

> (a)     First, identify the sentencing band and where the particular case falls within the applicable indicative sentencing range by considering the hurt caused by the offence. This would allow the court to derive the appropriate indicative starting point.

> (b)     Next, make the necessary adjustment to the indicative starting point sentence based on an assessment of the offender’s culpability as well as all other relevant factors. This may take the eventual sentence out of the applicable indicative sentencing range.

### Prosecution’s submissions

42     The Prosecution argued that the appropriate sentence to be imposed in this case was 6 weeks’ imprisonment.

43     While the Prosecution acknowledged that the harm caused was low, it highlighted several aggravating factors that it argued warranted that warranted this case being situated at the highest end of Band 1 of the _Low Song Chye_ framework:

> (a)     The offence involved a group attack. That the victim was outnumbered would have invariably resulted in a heightened sense of fear and alarm.

> (b)     The attack was fairly prolonged. The accused had punched the victim repeatedly on his face and body.

> (c)     The attack was entirely one-sided. That the victim did not retaliate at any point and did not hit the accused.

> (d)     The attack involved the use of a chair to hit the victim.

> (e)     The attack occurred in a residential area (in an HDB estate), where members of public should reasonably expect a degree of safety and security.

44     In addition to these offence-specific factors, the Prosecution also noted that the accused had claimed trial to the charge and that he was traced with violent and disorderly antecedents, for which an upward adjustment based on the framework in _Low Song Chye_ would be appropriate.

45     It was also highlighted that the co-accused Loges had been sentenced to 6 weeks’ imprisonment. While the Prosecution accepted that Loges’ conduct was more aggravated than the accused’s since he had continued to assault the victim after the accused had disengaged and had also used a plastic chair to hit the victim, it argued that this was balanced out by the fact that Loges had elected to plead guilty to his charge and his lack of prior violent antecedents.

### Defence’s submissions

46     The Defence was similarly of the view that the present case fell within Band 1 of the _Low Song Chye_ framework, though they contended that on the facts a high fine of $5,000 would suffice, or alternatively a sentence of not more than 1 week’s imprisonment or a Short Detention Order.

47     In taking this position, the Defence emphasised the fact that the accused had disengaged from the attack and that the entire attack had not been prolonged. In comparison, Loges’ conduct was more egregious than the accused, given that he had continued attacking the victim even after the accused had walked away.

48     The Defence also sought to draw a distinction between antecedents for violent offences and disorderly offences. Given that the Prosecution was not relying on the record of the 1999 conviction for the offence of voluntarily causing hurt, the Defence argued that the accused should be considered a disorderly person, but not a violent person.

### Reasons for the sentences imposed

49     Applying the _Low Song Chye_ sentencing framework, I agreed with parties that based on the harm caused to the victim in this case, this was clearly a Band 1 situation. The harm caused to the victim was minor. The Prosecution’s case was that the attack involving the accused caused him to suffer only bodily pain, and the medical evidence indicates that he had some contusions after the incident.

50     There were offence-specific factors in this case warranted an upward adjustment from the indicative starting point within Band 1 of the framework. Firstly, the charge involved three co-accused persons attacking a single victim, who did not physically retaliate. The accused himself punched the victim repeatedly on his face and body, while one of the other co-accused persons used a chair to hit the victim. Second, the incident occurred in a residential area, just outside some shops in a public housing estate. From the footage, onlookers could be seen watching as the altercation took place, and the incident clearly caused sufficient public disquiet for a police report to be made (P2).

51     In terms of offender-specific factors, I was mindful that the accused had claimed trial to the charge and was not a first offender, whereas the sentencing bands in _Low Song Chye_ are meant to apply to first-time offenders who plead guilty to their offences. Even if I were to disregard the 1999 antecedent record for voluntarily causing hurt, I noted that the accused did have several related antecedents, such as for disorderly behaviour as well as charges for voluntarily causing hurt that were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing in 2006. That said, the antecedents were rather dated, with the most recent set being more than 15 years old.

52     Another point of reference in this case was the sentence of 6 weeks’ imprisonment that was imposed on Loges for his charge of Section 323 read with Section 34 of the Penal Code in relation to this incident. Loges’ conduct was clearly more aggravated than the accused’s, given that he had been engaged in a more prolonged attack of the victim than the accused, and had even used a chair to hit the victim. The specific charge that he pleaded guilty to also included a reference to Loges’ use of a belt to hit the victim, which was done after the accused had walked away. That was an element that did not feature in the charge against the accused.

53     On a balance of these considerations, I was of the view that the appropriate sentence to be imposed in this case was 4 weeks’ imprisonment.

## Conclusion

54     For the reasons set out above, the accused was convicted on the charge and sentenced to 4 weeks’ imprisonment. He has appealed and is on bail pending appeal.
