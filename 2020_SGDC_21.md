### District Judge Kessler Soh:

## INTRODUCTION

1       Mr Han Bo, aged 43 years, was a Chinese national and Singapore permanent resident. He was married to a 41-year-old Singaporean woman. They had a business as fruit distributors. On 5 March 2018, at midnight, he found a man in the company of his wife in the master bedroom of their flat. The man was a 22-year-old delivery driver working for the defendant in the fruit distribution business. The defendant suspected the man and his wife to be having an affair. He went to the kitchen and took a chopper, and threatened to hurt the man with the chopper. He did not do so, but grabbed a kettle of hot water and splashed the hot water on the man (the “**Victim**”). The Victim suffered burn wounds over 7.5% of his body and was given 45 days’ medical leave.

2       The defendant was charged with voluntarily causing grievous hurt by splashing the hot water, an offence under s 325 of the _Penal Code_ (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“**Penal Code**”). One other charge of criminal intimidation with the chopper was taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.

3       The defendant pleaded guilty on 31 July 2019. The matter was adjourned to allow time for the prosecution to obtain a report on the defendant’s psychiatric condition. Submissions on the sentence were heard on 21 November 2019, and the defendant was sentenced to 9 months’ imprisonment. He has commenced serving the sentence.

4       The prosecution filed the present appeal on 27 November 2019 – not against the sentence, but against my decision not to make an order for the payment of compensation by the defendant to the Victim (the “**compensation order**”).

5       The grounds of my decision are set out below.

## PLEA OF GUILT

#### Proceeded charge

6       The defendant pleaded guilty to the following charge:

> DAC-908247-2018

> You \[...\] are charged that you on 5 March 2018, sometime in the morning, at Blk 212 Jurong East Street 21 #XXX, Singapore, did voluntarily cause grievous hurt to \[the Victim\], _namely_, by splashing a kettle of hot water on the \[Victim’s\] face, neck and left arm, knowing yourself to be likely to cause grievous hurt to him, and causing him to suffer burn wounds involving 7.5% of his total body surface area, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 325 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

#### Facts

7       At the material time, the defendant was a fruit distributor. The Victim, a 22-year-old Malaysian man, was working for the defendant as a delivery driver.

8       On 5 March 2018, at about 12 am, the defendant found the Victim in the company of his wife in the master bedroom of their flat. He accused them of having an affair. The three proceeded to the living room to talk. The defendant became very angry. He went to the kitchen and drew out a kitchen knife with a 17-cm blade and a chopper with an 18-cm blade. He returned to the living room to confront the Victim. The kitchen knife was in his back pocket and he was holding the chopper in his hand. He pointed the chopper at the Victim and threatened to cause grievous hurt to him. He shouted at the Victim, saying that he could not let the Victim go that day, and that he wanted the Victim to die.

9       The defendant then put down the chopper and the kitchen knife. He grabbed a kettle of hot water and splashed the hot water on the Victim’s face, neck and left arm once. Some hot water also entered the Victim’s left eye. The Victim suffered burn wounds as a result of the attack.

10     After the attack, the Victim was taken to the Accident and Emergency department of the Ng Teng Fong General Hospital. He was then transferred to the Singapore General Hospital (“SGH”) for further management. At the SGH, the Victim was assessed to have superficial partial thickness burn wounds involving 7.5% of his total body surface area. He was admitted and hospitalised for four days from 5 to 8 March 2018; he was given a total of 45 days’ medical leave from 5 March to 18 April 2018. The Victim was also seen at the Singapore National Eye Centre. He was noted to have mild epitheliopathy and left mild thermal injury. He did not sustain permanent damage of the sight in either eye.

#### Charge taken into consideration

11     Apart from the proceeded charge, the defendant also admitted to one other offence and consented to the offence being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. This related to his threatening to cause grievous hurt to the Victim by pointing the chopper at the Victim, with intent to cause alarm to the Victim, which was an offence of criminal intimidation punishable under s 506 (2nd limb) of the Penal Code.

## SENTENCE

#### Prosecution’s submissions

12     In a brief oral submission, the prosecution sought a custodial sentence of at least 12 months’ imprisonment. Reference was made to the sentencing approach for s 325 offences set out in _PP v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 69</span> at \[55\]. It was submitted that the primary sentencing objective was deterrence, and retribution was also relevant where there was heinous violence inflicted. In respect of the Victim’s injuries, while highlighting the injuries set out in the statement of facts, the prosecution accepted that there was no permanent damage from the burn injuries suffered by the Victim. In respect of the defendant’s culpability, the prosecution accepted that the defendant was assessed to be suffering from a major depressive disorder of moderate severity, and this condition was causally connected to his offences. The prosecution had taken these factors into account in calibrating their sentencing position, and sought a sentence to not less 12 months’ imprisonment.

#### Mitigation Plea

13     In the defendant’s mitigation plea, his counsel urged the court to impose a sentence of not more than 6 months’ imprisonment.

14     The defendant came to Singapore in 2007 to work in a fruit distributorship company. That was when he met his wife, who was the daughter of his boss. In 2012, he decided to start his own business in the same line. His business slowly took off and he hired the Victim to work for him in 2015. He left the business in the Victim’s care when he went back to China to visit his relatives in 2017. It was during this period of three to four months, while he was away, that his wife grew closer to the Victim. She gradually grew apart from him, even as she became more intimate with the Victim. The defendant felt extremely betrayed by his wife and the Victim. All his pent-up emotions culminated in the incident on 5 March 2018. The defendant was shocked and angry when he saw his wife and the Victim together in the master bedroom.

15     That incident was the defendant’s first brush with the law. He had no antecedents. He was a law-abiding person and of good character. His offence was an aberration and a one-off incident. He sincerely regretted his actions and was remorseful. After scalding the Victim with the hot water, he recognised the severity of his action and immediately sent the Victim to the hospital to seek treatment.

16     Counsel highlighted the defendant’s psychiatric condition caused by his broken marriage. He was diagnosed with major depressive disorder. He was suffering from depression at the time the offences were committed. The offences were not premeditated. The defendant only formed the guilty intention on the spot when he saw his wife and the Victim behaving intimately. In relation to the injuries suffered by the Victim, it was highlighted that the injuries suffered by the Victim did not leave any permanent disfiguration or scarring.

#### Sentencing considerations and sentence imposed

17     I first deal briefly with the reasons for the sentence imposed (which is not the subject of this appeal).

18     Under s 325 of the Penal Code, a person who voluntarily causes grievous hurt shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine or to caning.

19     In deciding on the appropriate sentence, I was guided by the decision of the Court of Appeal in _PP v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 69</span> which set out (at \[55\]) the sentencing approach for offences under s 325 of the Penal Code:

> 55    \[...\] we turn to the sentencing approach to be taken in cases prosecuted under s 325 of the Penal Code. The primary sentencing objective in such cases is likely to be deterrence. Further, retribution may also be relevant as a sentencing consideration where heinous violence has been inflicted. In our judgment, we think that sentencing in such cases should be approached in a two-step process as follows:

>> (a)    First, because the seriousness of the injury caused underscores the inherent mischief targeted by s 325, it is a good indicator of the gravity of the offence and can guide the court in determining the indicative starting point for sentencing.

>> (b)    Second, after the indicative starting point has been identified, the sentencing judge should consider the necessary adjustments upwards or downwards based on an assessment of the offender’s culpability and the presence of relevant aggravating and/or mitigating factors.

20     The first step of the inquiry, therefore, is to consider the Victim’s injuries. When the defendant splashed the hot water on the Victim, he did cause grievous hurt to the Victim in that the Victim was under medical leave and unable to work for 45 days, thus rendering the Victim “unable to follow his ordinary pursuits” (s 320(h), Penal Code). There was no evidence that the injuries were permanent and caused permanent disability. The injuries were thus relatively less severe than other forms of grievous hurt, such as death, emasculation, permanent privation or impairment of parts of the body, or permanent disfiguration of the head or face (s 320, Penal Code). The indicative starting point for sentencing in the present case would thus be at the lower end of the spectrum of sentences for s 325 offences.

21     At the second step, it was my judgement that the defendant’s culpability was not high. He was a first offender and was remorseful. The offence was not pre-meditated but was triggered by a reaction on his part when he found the Victim in the company of his wife. In the psychiatric report prepared by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), the psychiatrist was of the opinion that the defendant had major depressive disorder of moderate severity at the time of the offence, and he was also suffering from an acute stress reaction at the time of the incident. His depression and acute stress reaction at the time of the incident would have “significantly impaired his judgement and impulse control, given the particularly provocative circumstances.” All these considerations mitigated the culpability of the defendant and rendered _deterrence_ a less important sentencing objective in the present case.

22     That said, retribution remained an important sentencing consideration given the significant pain and suffering caused to the Victim by the defendant’s actions. In an unreported decision cited by the prosecution, _PP v Yong Martin_ (MA 73/2001/01) (“**_Yong Martin_**”), the offender (male, aged 47 years) pleaded guilty to one count under s 324 of the Penal Code for pouring a mug of hot water over his wife’s chest when she refused to remove her upper garment prior to sexual intercourse. She sustained 9% superficial dermal burns over the neck, chest, abdomen and hip. (The offender also pleaded guilty to another offence.) For the offence under s 324, the offender was sentenced (on appeal) to 9 months’ imprisonment.

23     Taking the sentence imposed in _Yong Martin_ as a broad reference point (while recognising that the offence provision was not the same), I was of the opinion that the sentence sought by the prosecution (at least 12 months’ imprisonment) was on the high side. While the harm caused to the Victim in the present case was more serious than in _Yong Martin_, this was offset by the fact that the culpability of the present defendant was significantly lower. On the other hand, the sentence sought by the defence (not more than 6 months’ imprisonment) was inadequate for retributive purposes.

24     In my judgment, on balance, a sentence of about 9 months’ imprisonment was appropriate, and the defendant was sentenced accordingly. The defendant is presently serving the sentence. Neither the prosecution nor defence has appealed against the sentence imposed.

## COMPENSATION ORDER?

25     The prosecution urged the court to make a compensation order[^1] for the defendant to pay a total amount of $13,938.86 in compensation to the Victim. This comprised medical bills of $9,438.86 in total; $3,000 for loss of income during the 45 days that the Victim was on medical leave (his income being about $2,000 per month); and $1,500 for pain and suffering.

26     The defence did not dispute the basis on which the compensation amount was derived. Counsel submitted, however, that the defendant would be unable to pay any compensation amount. The defendant had no money of his own. His pay, and the profit of the company, was “all controlled by his wife”. He had tried communicating with his wife, but his wife was not speaking to him.

27     The relevant principles for the exercise of the court’s discretion whether to make a compensation order were summarised in the recent decision of the High Court in _Low Song Chye v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 140</span> at \[107\]:

> 107    The relevant principles for the exercise of the court’s discretion were set out in _Tay Wee Kiat_ at \[6\] to \[11\] and _Soh Meiyun v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 3 SLR 299</span> at \[56\] to \[60\]. First, compensation orders are not intended to punish offenders but instead to allow a victim to recover compensation where a civil suit is an inadequate or impractical remedy. This includes, but is not confined to, cases where the victim is impecunious. Second, compensation should only be ordered in clear cases where the fact and extent of damage are either agreed, or readily and easily ascertainable on the evidence. Third, the court should adopt a broad common-sense approach in assessing whether compensation should be awarded, and not allow itself to be enmeshed in “refined questions of causation” (_Tay Wee Kiat_ at \[9\], citing _Public Prosecutor v Donohue Enilia_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 1 SLR(R) 220</span> (“_Donohue Enilia_”) at \[22\]). The court should be able to say, with a high degree of confidence, that the damage in question has been caused by the offence under circumstances which would ordinarily entitle the victim to damages. Fourth, the amount of compensation ordered should not exceed what would be reasonably obtainable in civil proceedings, and the order should only be made in respect of the injury which results from the offence for which the offender is convicted. _Fifth, the order should not be oppressive, and the court must be satisfied that the accused will have the means to pay it within a reasonable time_.

\[Emphasis in italics added at the last sentence\]

28     I declined to make a compensation order because I was not satisfied that the defendant would have the means to pay the amount within a reasonable time. Counsel had informed the court that the defendant had no money of his own, and that his pay and the profit of his company was under the control of his wife. These assertions were entirely plausible given the defendant’s circumstances, in particular the fact that he had been estranged from his wife for some time. There was no evidence that the defendant had any other sources of funds to pay the compensation amount. I also did not consider it expedient to adjourn the matter for a further inquiry into the defendant’s financial circumstances. There had been a lapse of more than one year between the time the defendant was first charged in court (on 6 March 2018) and his plea of guilt (on 31 July 2019). Close to four more months elapsed pending the psychiatric assessment of the defendant at the IMH and the preparation of the psychiatric report, before the sentence was passed on 21 November 2019. The defendant expressed his desire, through his counsel, to serve out his sentence as soon as possible. Any further delay in the matter would thus have been prejudicial to the defendant.

29     Under these circumstances, if a compensation order was made and the defendant had no means to pay, he would have to serve out an additional term of imprisonment in default of payment of the compensation. That would simply amount to additional punishment on account of the defendant’s inability to pay, and would be oppressive. It would run contrary to the rationale and purpose of compensation orders. I therefore declined to make the compensation order.
