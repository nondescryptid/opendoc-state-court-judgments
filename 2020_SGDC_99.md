Negligence – Industrial Accident – Duty of Care – Vicarious Liability

16 April 2020

### District Judge Lee Li Choon:

## Background

1       The Plaintiff’s (“P”) claim in this suit against the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants is for damages for the injuries he suffered in an industrial accident that occurred on 31 May 2016 while he was working under a valid work permit as an employee of the 1st Defendant (“D1”).

2       At the material time, the 2nd Defendant (“D2”) was engaged as the main contractor for the project, “Proposed Erection of a 2 Storey Envelope Control Intermediate Terrace Dwelling House With An Attic On Lot 03286L MK 04 At 22 Grove Crescent” (“the Project”). In turn, the 2nd Defendant engaged D1 as its sub-contractor to carry out general construction works including excavation works at the Project’s worksite. Both D1 and D2 are related companies.

3       For the excavation works at the Project’s worksite, D2 also engaged the 3rd Defendant (D3) to supply an excavator with bucket including diesel and a trained and qualified excavator operator at the daily rate of $300. Pursuant to this arrangement, D3 supplied the excavator and an excavator operator by the name of Sujan Abdur Razzak Sikder (“Sujan”).

4       The accident happened on 31 May 2016 when the excavator at the Project’s worksite operated by Sujan ran over P’s right leg, pelvis area and pinned him down under the metal wheel-track of the excavator.

5       The undisputed facts concerning the accident are as follows. At about 4.30pm on 31 May 2016, after the relevant area at the Project’s worksite had been excavated, the foreman for the Project, Panchanathan Santhosh Kumar (“Santhosh”), an employee of D1, went into the excavated pit to carry out requisite checks and noted that there was still earth at the innermost parts within the pit which had to be removed by the use of a spade. Santhosh then instructed P to fetch a spade from the toolbox near the entrance of the Project’s worksite. While P was walking to fetch the spade, the excavator moved and collided into him, pinning him under the metal wheel-track of the excavator, thereby causing him the following injuries: -

> a.     Open fracture of the right anterior superior iliac spine;

> b.     Injury to right side of pelvis and right thigh; and

> c.     Stiffness of right hip and numbness over right thigh.

6       It is not disputed that Santhosh was appointed by D1 as the site safety supervisor and foreman for the Project at the material time[^1]. In turn, in respect of the excavation works, Santhosh reported to Ong Siaw Meng (“Ong”) who is D1’s employee and the Project’s Project Manager. In respect of the excavation works for the Project, D1 deployed Santhosh as the site supervisor and foreman and 5 workers, including P, all of whom work under Santhosh’s supervision. When the accident happened, only Santhosh, P and the excavator operator, Sujan were around the immediate vicinity. Sujan was operating the excavator. The other 4 workers were working at a different section on a lower level and they did not witness the accident. Ong was not at the Project’s worksite at the material time.

7       While the fact that the excavator must have moved while P was walking close to it is not in dispute, the circumstances under which the excavator moved is in dispute. In this regard, it is noted that it is not in dispute that Sujan went back to his home country in June 2016 (shortly after the accident) and none has called Sujan as a witness. Against this background as detailed above, my findings as to the circumstances under which the excavator moved or how the accident came about would be material.

8       D1 and D2’s case is that at the material time, P was assigned the role of a banksman to direct the movement of the excavator[^2]. According to Santhosh, he had discussed with Ong and it was decided that P would be suitable as a banksman for this Project[^3].

## P’s Case against D1 and D2

9       In closing submissions, P’s pleaded case against D1 and D2 of a breach of duty of care is summarised as follows:

> (i)     D1 and D2 had not trained P as a banksman;

> (ii)     D1 and D2 had failed to properly supervise the excavation work;

> (iii)     D1 and D2 had failed to cordon off or demarcate the area around the excavation work; and

> (iv)     D1 and D2 did not have a proper system for risk assessments or ensuring the safety of their workers.

## P’s Case against D3

10     As for P’s case against D3, P says D3 is vicariously liable for the negligent acts of Sujan who is D3’s employee, which caused injuries to P.

## My Decision

#### What is the cause of the accident?

11     Before I outline what the relevant issues for my determination are, I will first examine the evidence that has been adduced to determine how the accident happened or what the cause of the accident was.

12     It is a fact that neither D1, D2 nor D3 conducted any detailed investigation into the accident or if any of them did any investigation, no investigation report had been put up nor any statement from any witness had been recorded in relation to this accident.

13     In his affidavit of evidence in chief, P said, “At around 4.30pm, when I was working near the worksite, the foreman (ie Santhosh) asked me to retrieve a spade from the storeroom. As I was walking towards the storeroom, **_the excavator operator suddenly reversed the excavator and it knocked into me_**. Upon impact, I fell to the ground…”[^4] He further stated, “Immediately after that, the foreman quickly shouted at the excavator operator and hit the excavator with a timber stick to get his attention. The excavator operator then moved the excavator away from me, releasing me from under the weight of the wheel-tract.”[^5] (Emphasis mine)

14     According to Santhosh, “The excavation works started on 23 May 2016. Prior thereto, **_I spoke to the Plaintiff and Sujan together to stress that Sujan was not to operate or move the excavator unless directed by the Plaintiff to do so and to confirm the signals that were to be used._** Unsurprisingly, both of them were fully aware of the signals. For example, the Plaintiff would blow the whistle once and show the appropriate hand-signal to direct Sujan to stop operating the excavator and bring the bucket to rest on the ground and to ensure that the excavator remained stationary until the Plaintiff blew the whistle twice and showed the appropriate hand-signal for Sujan to move or operate the excavator again.”[^6] (Emphasis mine)

15     Santhosh further stated, “At about 4.30pm on 31 May 2016, I went to inspect the levels of the pit that was being excavated by Sujan. I first instructed the Plaintiff to direct Sujan to stop operating the excavator. The Plaintiff accordingly blew his whistle once and gave the appropriate hand-signal to Sujan. Sujan then brought the bucket to rest on the ground and stopped operating the excavator. The excavator was stationary before I entered the pit.”[^7]

16     It is an undisputed fact that just before the accident happened, Santhosh was in the excavated pit to inspect the excavation work that had been done and he had instructed P to fetch a spade from the toolbox upon such inspection[^8]. According to Santhosh, at the time the accident happened, he was in an excavated pit doing his inspection, with his back facing the excavator and P[^9], and thus, Santhosh did not witness the excavator moving and knocking P down. Santhosh only realised about the accident when he turned around and saw P lying on the ground facing upwards, after he suddenly heard P’s shouting[^10].

17     In his affidavit of evidence in chief, Santhosh maintained that though he did not witness how the accident actually happened, he did not hear P blowing the whistle twice at any time after he had blown the whistle once to direct Sujan to stop operating the excavator and bring the bucket to rest on the ground (blowing the whistle twice is the signal for the excavator to move)[^11].

18     In court, Santhosh again confirmed that Sujan had moved the excavator even though no signal was given to Sujan to move the excavator.

> Q    Okay. Now, I want to ask you about the accident. You said that you had, uh, Munsh---you had told Munshi to blow the whistle to stop, and then you had instructed him to fetch a changkol or you had gone into the pit first?

> A    Munshi whistled and then the machine was stopped. And then I told him to go and get the changkol

> Q    Then you went into the pit after that?

> A    Yes.

> Q    You went into the pit because the excavator was stopped?

> A    Yes.

> Q    So, it was---you thought that it was safe for you to go into the pit?

> A    Yes.

> Q    You were not expecting the excavator to move because no signal was given by Munshi?

> A    Yes.

> Q    Okay. So, inside---you were inside the pit; could Sujan see you inside the pit?

> A    Yes, can see.

> Q    Sujan would have known that Munshi left as well, right, to get the changkol?

> A    Yes.

> Q    So, could it have been---I’m just suggesting to you, could it have been that Sujan sees you inside the pit, he wants to give you a bit more space and he thus reversed; could it have been? I’m suggesting to you.

> A    No, couldn’t have been like that. The bucket was already inside and there was space for me. That is why I went in to check.

> Q    Yes. There was space for you, but he may have reversed to make it even safer for you. Further the---get bucket farther away from you.

> A    I would not know that for sure.

> Q    Okay. But, regardless, you were not expecting the excavator to move, that’s why you went in to the pit?

> A    Yes.

> Q    The excavator moved, because the operator made it move?

> A    Yes.

> Q    It moved, even though no signal was given.

> A    Yes.[^12]

19     Mr Tan Gim Peow (“Tan”), who is employed as D3’s manager and who gave evidence on behalf of D3, confirmed in court that the accident was caused by the excavator reversing and knocking P down. In his affidavit of evidence in chief and in his oral testimony at cross-examination, Tan was silent as to why Sujan moved the excavator.

> Q    Oh, so you were actually spoken to about the MOM incident report?

> A    No, no, no. I was---I knew about this incident.

> Q    Only in the course of preparing the MOM---

> A    No, no, no.

> Q    incident report?

> A    No, no, no. The---the next day I was at \[inaudible\]. I can’t clearly remember whether it’s the next day or the same day. They told me there were something happened. So, the---the main contractor did the necessary---yah.

> Q    So, you were informed of this and did you take any steps to ascertain from Sujan what had happened?

> A    Yes.

> Q    What did Sujan say to you?

> A    He say that, you know, just a---the I---the excavator knock into somebody. It---it---

> Q    Oh, he didn’t tell you---

> A    it---it---it---

> Q    how it happened?

> A    He didn’t tell us how it happens.

> Q    And you didn’t ask?

> A    I did ask. He---he just tell me he just reverse whatsoever, okay? But the main I---then we went down to speak to also, you know, to go down to the site to see what happened and, you know, of course, it’s just not a, uh, fatal accident. So---I mean, the injured guy has been sent to a hospital for treatment.[^13]

20     According to Tan, he was informed by Sujan that Sujan had moved the excavator because someone told him to move the excavator[^14]. However, this is hearsay evidence as Sujan was not called to give evidence as to what had happened and Tan was not at the accident site to witness what had happened at the Project’s worksite.

21     As Sujan has not been called as a witness to refute the accounts given by both P and Santhosh as to how the accident happened, and as there is absolutely no evidence to the contrary, I conclude that the accident was caused by Sujan moving the excavator even though he had not been given any signal by either P or Santhosh to move the excavator. Moreover, this movement of the excavator happened while P was acting upon the instructions given to him by Santosh to fetch a spade and P was at that time, walking near the excavator.

### Relevant Issues

22     Based on my finding as to the cause of the accident and based on P’s pleaded case against the Defendants, the following are the issues for my determination:

> (i)     Was Sujan negligent in that he moved the excavator without having been given any signal to do so? If so, who (D1, D2 or D3) is liable for Sujan’s negligence?

> (ii)     Was Santhosh (the foreman and site supervisor at the Project’s worksite and also employee of D1) negligent when he instructed P to retrieve the spade without ensuring that it was safe to do so? If so, is D1 vicariously liable as the foreman’s employer?

> (iii)     Were D1 and/or D2 negligent for failing to provide P with the requisite training for the role of a banksman?

> (iv)     Were D1 and/or D2 negligent for failing to provide competent workmen, in particular, the foreman to work with P?

> (v)     Were D1 and/or D2 negligent for not providing P with a safe place to work, in particular, for not cordoning off the worksite appropriately?

> (vi)     Is P contributorily liable for his own injuries?

#### Was Sujan negligent in moving the excavator without having been given any signal to do so?

23     According to Tan who gave evidence on behalf of D3 as D3’s manager, an excavator operator cannot move the excavator without any signal from the banksman. This is the only available evidence that points to the standard of care to be exercised by a reasonable excavator operator.

No.

So, he’s not supposed to move the excavator without---

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

any instructions or signal from the banksman to do so?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Yes, that---that is what---

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

And this applies in all cases?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Yes.[^15]

 |

  
  

24     It is trite law that the standard of care is the objective standard of a reasonable person using ordinary care and skill. In this case, the standard of care is that expected of a reasonable excavator operator using ordinary care and skill. As stated by Tan, D3’s manager, an excavator operator is not supposed to move his excavator without any instructions or signal from the banksman to do so. That is the level of precaution that a reasonable person in the shoes of an excavator operator would adopt.

25     According to both P and Santhosh, no signal was given to Sujan by P or Santhosh to move the excavator. The available evidence from both the Plaintiff and on behalf of the 1st and 2nd Defendants therefore shows that no signal had been given to Sujan to move the excavator after the excavator was guided to come to a stop. In moving the excavator without any signal or instructions from either P or Santhosh for him to do so, Sujan had clearly breached the reasonable standard of care expected of a reasonable excavator operator.

#### Who is liable for Sujan’s negligent act?

26     Having established that Sujan had breached the standard of care expected of a reasonable person in the shoes of an excavator operator, the next question I have to answer is, who is liable for Sujan’s negligent act of moving the excavator without any instructions or signal to do so.

27     P has enumerated numerous particulars of negligence against all three Defendants. In relation to all 3 Defendants, P’s case in a nutshell is that – (i) They had failed to provide competent workmen to signal and/or alert P to the moving/operating excavator; (ii) They had failed to ensure that the excavator operator had carried out his work in a safe manner so as not to endanger the safety of P. It suffices to say that the failure to exercise due care in operating the excavator was pleaded as a particular of negligence against all 3 Defendants. In relation to D3, P’s case against D3 is also that D3 is vicariously liable for the negligent acts of Sujan.

28     It is a fact that Sujan is an employee of D3. D3 however denies that they are vicariously liable for Sujan’s negligent act for the following reasons:

> (i)     D3 was not engaged by D1 or D2 as a sub-contractor for the construction at the Project’s worksite;

> (ii)     D3 had merely entered into an agreement with D2 for the loan of an excavator together with a trained operator in exchange for the consideration of SGD4,560 and it was by virtue of such agreement for the supply of an excavator and trained operator that Sujan was provided to D2 which then passed on the excavator and trained operator to D1 to carry out the excavation work at the Project’s worksite;

> (iii)     Throughout the course of the supply of excavator and trained operator, Sujan was effectively an employee of D1 and/or D2 and at the disposal of D1 and/or D2. The dates that Sujan was working for D1 and/or D2 were 3 May 2016, 19 and 20 May 2016, 23 May 2016 to 1 June 2016.

> (iv)     Throughout the course of the supply of excavator and trained operator, D3 had no charge, management, care and/or control of Sujan and/or the Project’s worksite.

29     According to Tan, when D2 contacted D3 for the supply of an excavator together with a trained operator, it was D2 that identified the model of excavator that was required and D3 played no role in determining the type of excavator for the Project. Neither did D3 inspect the Project’s worksite prior to the supply of the excavator.

Pang:

Your Honour, I---I realised I am veering into leading questions, so do---do---do forgive me for that.

So, when you say “called up for the machine” it means, they knew exactly what machine they wanted?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yah. They wanted SQ---what you called the “104”, people call it “0-4”. I mean, long-typed---uh, probably, they got---but it’s actually equivalent to a---a model called “SK135”.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

SK135.

 |
| 

A

 | 

35, yes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Okay. And just to close this one off. And you---you did not go and check the site. Can I ask why? Whe---when---when they asked you the---when---when they told you the specific model that they wanted and you just allowed that to happen and rented the machine to them, can I ask why?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Okay. That bui---that a---that particular area, that building was demolished by us, okay? Alright? And I---I used---it much---you can call a much bigger machine for the---for the job, lah. So, basically, if they want that one to do the work, I mean, uh, unless, they’re want---you want something s---tw---twice bigger than, of course, lah. But to me, is they asked for that, I gave them. Just give only. Because before---before---before the substructure works, we did a demolition for them.”

30     In closing submissions, counsel for D3 submitted that the Court of Appeal case of **_Ng Huat Seng and another v Munib Mohammad Madni and another_** <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 58</span> (_Ng Huat Seng_) is instructive and gives guidance on when vicarious liability should be imposed on the employer for the negligent act of an employee. In relation to the law on vicarious liability, it was noted by the Court of Appeal that -

> “As we will elaborate below, there are two separate inquiries to be undertaken when determining whether vicarious liability should be imposed. The first examines the nature of the relationship between the defendant and the tortfeasor. While the law does not confine this to a relationship of employment, it remains necessary to establish a relationship of sufficient closeness such as would make it fair, just and reasonable to impose liability on the defendant for the tortious acts of another.”[^16]

> “The second inquiry to be made when deciding whether vicarious liability should be imposed is whether there is a sufficient connection between the relationship between the defendant and the tortfeasor on the one hand, and the commission of the tort on the other. Has that relationship created or significantly enhanced the risk of the tort being committed? This is a second and distinct part of the analysis which is only reached if the claimant can first establish the existence of a special relationship between the defendant and the tortfeasor.”[^17]

31     In short, vicarious liability is not limited to a relationship of employer and employee. In the context of this case, vicarious liability can be imposed on either D1, D2 or D3 for Sujan’s negligent act as long as it is established that there is a relationship of sufficient closeness as would make it fair, just and reasonable to impose liability and that relationship had, in some way, created or significantly enhanced, by virtue of that relationship, the very risk of the tort being committed by Sujan.

32     I turn now to look at the relationship between Sujan and each of the 3 Defendants. In his affidavit of evidence in chief, Ong said that his duties as the Senior Project Manager of D1 included overseeing all the projects of D1, including this particular Project.[^18] Ong also said, “At the time the excavation works were being undertaken, the 1st Defendant had control of the Project worksite.”[^19] It was his assessment that the excavation works to be carried out by D1 at the Project’s worksite was a simple and straightforward one[^20]. For this reason, it was decided that it would be good enough to deploy 5 construction workers including P to carry out the excavation works under Santhosh’s supervision[^21]. As the excavation works was a simple and straightforward one, it is implicit in Ong’s affidavit of evidence in chief that he saw no need to take issue with D2 having engaged D3 to supply an excavator with bucket including diesel and a trained and qualified excavator operator in respect of the excavation works only (as opposed to engaging D3 as a subcontractor to supervise and carry out the excavation works)[^22].

33     Ong’s testimony is corroborated by the testimony of Santhosh. Santhosh said that in respect of the excavation works for the Project, D1 deployed 5 workers including P to work under his supervision[^23]. He said he was informed that D2 had engaged D3 to supply an excavator with bucket including diesel and a trained and qualified excavator operator for the excavation works.[^24] He also said his duties as a site safety supervisor and foreman included making sure that Sujan was a trained and qualified excavator operator. And he was satisfied that Sujan was suitably trained and qualified before the excavation works commenced.[^25]

34     As for control and supervision over Sujan at the Project’s worksite, this is what Santhosh said in his affidavit of evidence in chief – “The excavation works started on 23 May 2016. Prior thereto, **_I spoke to the Plaintiff and Sujan together to stress that Sujan was not to operate or move the excavator unless directed by the Plaintiff to do so and to confirm the signals that were to be used_**. Unsurprisingly, both of them were fully aware of the signals. For example, the Plaintiff would blow the whistle once and show the appropriate hand-signal to direct Sujan to stop operating the excavator and bring the bucket to rest on the ground and to ensure that the excavator remained stationary until the Plaintiff blew the whistle twice and showed the appropriate hand-signal for Sujan to move or operate the excavator again.” From this, it is clear to me that Santhosh was overall in charge and had oversight and supervision of the excavation works, including how Sujan was to operate the excavator based on specific instructions etc. (Emphasis mine)

35     Thus, on the facts, D2 engaged D3 to provide Sujan as the excavator operator for the excavation works at the Project. Pursuant to this contractual arrangement, D2 left Sujan to work under the control and supervision of D1’s employees as the Project’s construction works had been subcontracted out to D1. At the Project’s worksite, it was D1’s Santhosh who gave instructions to Sujan as regards the operation of the excavator, including how Sujan was to act in accordance with P’s whistleblowing and hand signals. In addition, instructions to P as to how to guide Sujan in the operation of the excavator were also given by D1’s Santhosh. It is a fact that no employee from D3 was present at the Project’s worksite. Other than the supply of the excavator and Sujan as the excavator operator to D2 for the excavation works at the Project’s worksite that were carried out under D1’s charge and supervision, D3 was not involved at all, whether prior to the supply or during the excavation works at the Project’s worksite.

36     Therefore, on the facts of this case, the relationship that is of sufficient closeness such as would make it fair, just and reasonable to impose liability for the tortious acts of Sujan is that between D1 and D2 on the one hand and Sujan on the other. It is also this relationship that created or significantly enhanced the risk of the negligent act or tort being committed as Sujan who was engaged by D2 for the excavation works at the Project’s worksite, was acting under the instructions, control and supervision of D1’s employees. Other than the supply of the excavator and a qualified excavator operator, D3 was not even remotely involved at all. No personnel from D3 was present at the Project’s worksite in the days leading up to the accident and the accident itself. As stated by Ong, prior to the commencement of the excavation works, it was D1 that arranged for workplace safety and health consultants to prepare the Risk Assessment for the excavation works[^26]. Thereafter, it was Santhosh’s duty to conduct the risk assessment briefing for all the workers including workers of “other subcontractors” such as the excavator operator supplied by D3[^27].

37     Under the circumstances as detailed above, imposing liability on D1 and D2 would be fair, just and reasonable.

38     On the whole, applying the law on vicarious liability to the facts and circumstances of this case, I find that imposing vicarious liability on D1 and D2 for the tortious act of Sujan, the excavator operator would lead to a fair, just and reasonable outcome.

#### Was Santhosh (foreman and employee of D1) negligent when he instructed P to retrieve the spade without ensuring that it was safe to do so? If so, is D1 vicariously liable as the foreman’s employer?

39     The accident happened after P was instructed by Santhosh to retrieve the spade from the toolbox. The position taken by D1 and D2 is that P was appointed as the banksman for the excavation works and as the banksman, it was his task to direct the movement of the excavator[^28].

40     According to Ong, Santhosh had discussed with him on the appointment of the banksman to direct the movements of the excavator and Ong informed Santhosh that P had performed the role of banksman carrying out excavation works in similar projects previously and was therefore deemed to be able to carry out the role of banksman.

41     P however, has denied any knowledge of the assignment of the role of banksman to him. There are also inconsistencies and rather incomprehensible aspects in P’s testimony in court regarding this. Nevertheless, regardless of whether P was given the role of banksman or not, this does not detract from the fact that it is not D1 and D2’s case that it was P’s failings as a banksman that caused the accident. In fact, in cross-examination, Santhosh maintained that P had directed the excavator to come to a stop before he moved off to look for the spade. It is also noteworthy that Santhosh himself had thought it was safe as the excavator had been brought safely to a stop, and that was why he went into the pit himself to perform physical checks[^29]. Furthermore, as I have already stated above, it is Santhosh’s testimony that there was no signal given to Sujan to move the excavator.

42     Therefore, even if I accept the fact that P was appointed as the banksman and it was his duty to ensure that safe and proper instructions were given to Sujan as regards the operation of the excavator, there is no evidence whatsoever that P had acted negligently as the banksman.

43     In the circumstances, I consider this contention of D1 and D2 that P was appointed as the banksman to be a red herring. Nothing turns on whether P was or was not indeed appointed as a banksman. The negligent act is that of Sujan moving the excavator when no signal had been given to him to move the excavator and when it was not expected that the excavator would move. In Santhosh’s own words, it was Santhosh himself who “_first instructed (P) to direct Sujan to stop operating the excavator_”[^30] and in compliance with his instructions, P “_accordingly blew his whistle once and gave the appropriate hand-signal to Sujan_”[^31] and “_Sujan then brought the bucket to rest on the ground and stopped operating the excavator.”[^32]_ Santhosh further said, “_The excavator was stationary before I entered the pit_”.[^33] Based on this, it did not matter whether P was indeed appointed as a banksman or not. Essentially, P did act as instructed and the excavator was brought to a stop.

44     After the excavator was brought to a stop, P did not give any signal for the excavator to move. The reason why P did not give any signal for the excavator to move was most probably that he was not given any instructions to do so by Santhosh as Santhosh had instructed him to fetch the spade from the toolbox.

Okay. But, regardless, you were not expecting the excavator to move, that’s why you went in to the pit?

Okay, thank you. Now, I’m just going to ask one question. Not---not a que---I’m not asking a question, I---I’m just making a statement to put this out there. You know that if not Munshi, who was injured, you may have been the other one injured. I’m---it’s just a statement.

45     Based on the unchallenged account given by Santhosh, he had instructed P to retrieve the spade from the toolbox only after giving instructions to P to direct Sujan to stop operating the excavator. The available evidence does not point to Santhosh having fallen short of the reasonable standard of care in the circumstances. In the circumstances, I find that it has not been shown that Santhosh was negligent when he instructed P to retrieve the spade.

#### Were D1 and/or D2 negligent for failing to provide P with the requisite training for the role of a banksman?

46     There is no allegation or any evidence thereon relating to P’s negligence in directing the operation of the excavator as the cause of the accident. Be that as it may, notwithstanding whether P was appointed as a banksman or not, there is no evidence to support the case that the accident was the result of the failings of P as a “banksman”, even by the evidence of D1 and D2. I am therefore satisfied that nothing turns on whether D1 and/or D2 had failed to provide P with the requisite training to perform the tasks of a banksman.

47     In any event, according to Tan, it is not possible to operate an excavator without a banksman[^35]. In respect of this, it is not in dispute that D1 had overall supervision of the excavation works at the Project’s worksite. From Santhosh’s testimony that he “_first instructed the Plaintiff to direct Sujan to stop operating the excavator_”[^36], it is also clear to me that P was at all material time, working under the direction and instructions of D1’s foreman and site supervisor, Santhosh.

48     Therefore, in assigning P to perform the crucial role of guiding the movement of the excavator, D1 owes a duty of care to P to ensure that P was given proper instructions to perform his role and/or was properly trained to perform the role of a banksman. D1 owes a duty of care towards P not to put P at risk of injuries while performing the role of a banksman. In this regard, D1 has not adduced any evidence to show that P had received training as a banksman. According to Santhosh and Ong, P was assigned the role of a banksman simply because the excavation works was deemed to be a simple one and because P had allegedly performed such a role in similar projects previously[^37]. Thus, if, indeed the accident had been caused by P’s failings as a banksman as D1 and D2 would have the court believe, in failing to adduce any evidence whatsoever to show that P had been trained or had performed the role of a banksman in similar projects as alleged, I am unable to find that D1 has not breached its duty of care towards P as P’s employer.

#### Were D1/D2 negligent for failing to provide competent workmen, in particular, the foreman to work with P?

49     While P had made bare allegations that D1 and/or D2 ought to have provided competent workmen, in particular, the foreman to work with P, P has adduced no evidence whatsoever in support of his case that the foreman, Santhosh was not competent and/or was negligent. P has therefore, not shown that it was Santhosh’s negligence that caused him to suffer injuries. In the circumstances, there is no finding as regards D1’s and/or D2’s vicarious liability for Santhosh’s alleged “incompetence”.

#### Were D1/D2 negligent for not providing P with a safe place to work, in particular, for not cordoning off the worksite appropriately?

50     According to Ong, given the dimensions of the excavated pit and the size of the premises at the Project’s worksite, it was not possible to cordon off the area around the location of the excavation works[^38]. Be that as it may, in light of the absence of evidence that cordoning off the area around the location of the excavation works could have been carried out and that this would have prevented the accident, it is therefore not established that cordoning off the worksite would have prevented the accident from happening. In fact, according to Santhosh, P was required to stand next to the excavator to direct the movement of the excavator in any event[^39].

#### Whether P was contributorily negligent

51     As I have already found that nothing turns on P’s failings or not as a banksman, there is no evidence to show that P was contributorily negligent in the circumstances.

## Conclusion

52     In conclusion, the accident was caused by Sujan’s negligent act of moving the excavator when there was no instruction or signal given to him to move the excavator. The 2nd Defendant had engaged the 3rd Defendant to supply the excavator and Sujan as the trained operator and had left Sujan to work under the supervision of the 1st Defendant’s foreman and site supervisor, Santhosh. The 1st Defendant is the party that had overall supervision, control and management of the excavation works at the Project’s worksite, and Sujan was acting under the 1st Defendant’s instructions and overall supervision, control and management of the excavation works. In the circumstances, I find both the 1st and 2nd Defendants jointly and severally vicariously liable for the negligence of Sujan. The Plaintiff’s claim is therefore allowed at 100% liability against the 1st and 2nd Defendants, with damages to be assessed by and costs reserved to the Registrar. The Plaintiff’s claim against the 3rd Defendant is dismissed with costs to the 3rd Defendant; such costs shall be taxed if not agreed.
