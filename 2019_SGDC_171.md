20 August 2019 - Judgment reserved.

### District Judge Toh Yung Cheong:

1       The accused claimed trial to one charge of littering under s.17(1)(a) r/w s.17(3) and one charge of hindering an authorised officer under s.82(a) p/u s.103 of the Environmental Public Health Act (Cap 95 2002 Rev Ed). A second accused person Phua Jian Zhi was initially tried together with the accused but the prosecution subsequently withdrew the charge against him.

2       At the conclusion of the trial, I convicted the accused on the charge of littering and acquitted him of the charge of hindering an authorised officer. The prosecution has appealed against the acquittal while the accused did not appeal against his conviction. Therefore, this judgment sets out the reasons for my decision to acquit the accused on the charge of hindering an authorised officer.

## Charge

3       The charge under s.82(a) states:

> You, on the 19th day of April 2018 between 1800hrs and 2000hrs at Golden Village Yishun located along 51 Yishun Central 1, Singapore 768794, did hinder NEA authorized officers namely Enforcement Officers Rajendran s/o Ramaswamy and Liew Heng Theng Valmond, in the performance and execution of their duties, to wit, you refused to provide your personal particulars upon their lawful request, and caused undue delay to the enforcement action, and you have thereby contravened Section 82(a) of the Environmental Public Health Act, Cap 95, which is punishable under Section 103 of the aforesaid Act.

## Prosecution’s Version of Facts

4       The Prosecution’s case is based on the evidence of two NEA officers and two Police Officers. These witnesses gave their accounts of what transpired on the day in question.

5       On 19 April 2018, National Environment Agency Officers Rajendran s/o Ramaswamy (PW1, “Rajendran”), and Valmond Liew (PW2, “Valmond”) were on enforcement duty in the vicinity of Northpoint City, a shopping mall in Yishun.

6       Between 5.45pm to 5.50pm, Rajendran observed the accused smoking a cigarette at the entrance of the loading and unloading bay and speaking with a lady.[^1] The accused was wearing a pink-coloured Foodpanda uniform and a black cap pulled backwards.

7       There was a rubbish bin in the centre of the bay and there were five other persons crowding around the bin and smoking. The accused was 5 metres away from the bin. Rajendran saw the accused look at his handphone and click on it. The accused threw the cigarette butt on the floor, stamped on it with his right leg to extinguish the butt, said something to the lady he was speaking to, and turned to cross the road towards the entrance of Golden Village Yishun (“GV”), which was a building that was across the road from Northpoint City.

8       Rajendran followed the accused inside GV and observed him collecting a food order from a stall. After the accused collected the food order and proceeded to the exit, Rajendran stopped the accused at the GV lobby.[^2] Rajendran took out his pass, showed it to the accused and told him that he was from the National Environment Agency and that he had committed a littering offence.

9       The accused looked startled and replied “I don’t smoke.” Rajendran replied that he saw the accused smoking and said “I need your particulars, may I have your particulars?” They proceeded outside GV to the entrance where the accused had parked his electric bicycle. The accused was uncooperative and did not provide his particulars. Instead, he made a call and informed Rajendran that his “gang is coming.”

10     According to his testimony Rajendran made several requests for particulars:

> 10.1.1    “May I have your particulars?”

> 10.1.2    “I need your particulars, may I have your particulars?”

> 10.1.3    “You wait. Can you give me your particulars?”

> 10.1.4    “I need your particulars because I’m going to issue a littering ticket.”

> 10.1.5    “Sir, please give me your particulars.”[^3]

11     Rajendran then informed the accused:

> _For your information, if you produce your particulars now, I’ll be giving you a littering ticket. If I have to call for reinforcements, this ticket may become non-compoundable.[^4]_

12     The accused remained uncooperative and said “I don’t care, I will appeal.” Rajendran called the police at around 6.10pm. While waiting for the police to come, a new group of persons in Foodpanda uniforms arrived. One of the persons who arrived was Phua Jian Zhi (“Phua”). This was around 6.15pm.

13     Phua asked Rajendran for proof of his identify but Rajendran declined as he was not required to identify himself to other parties. Phua then informed the accused that since there’s no proof of identity, the accused need not produce his particulars.[^5] Phua and the accused then informed persons wearing Foodpanda uniforms in the vicinity that there was a possibility of “a fake or imposter NEA officer and asked them use their phones to record the situation. Apart from filming them, the persons at the scene were also shouting and Rajendran believed that he heard some vulgarities uttered. This caused Rajendran to become frightened.[^6]

14     At about 6.30pm, Senior Staff Sergeant Rossdeli Bin Kasman (PW3) and Sergeant Teo Keng Hui (PW4, “Sgt Teo”) arrived at the scene. Rajendran informed the officers of what had happened.

15     Sgt Teo then proceeded to speak to the accused who claimed that Rajendran had not shown him any pass. Sgt Teo informed the accused that she could confirm that Rajendran was an NEA officer[^7] and asked for his particulars. However, the accused refused to provide his particulars to the NEA officers. Nevertheless, the accused provided his particulars to Sgt Teo verbally and Sgt Teo verified the particulars with her office. [^8]

16     SSSgt Rossdeli testified that when they first approached the accused he was a bit agitated and angry but as time went by, he co-operated. The accused explained to SSSgt Rossdeli that he refused to give his particulars as he denied throwing the cigarette butt on the floor.

17     Rajendran then informed the police officers that if the accused did not provide his particulars to the NEA, the NEA would need to write to the police for his particulars. According to Sgt Teo, Rajendran only told her that “if the subject do not want to give the particulars, it will become a Court case.” Sgt Teo told the accused:

> _\[I\]t’s his_ **_choice_** _whether he want to give the particulars, if he do not want to give, then it will become a Court case, if not can just accept the summon, then go for the appeal._ [^9] (emphasis added)

18     After about 10 minutes, the accused finally agreed to provide his particulars to Rajendran. According to Rajendran, the police officers gave Rajendran the accused’s name written on a piece of paper. One of the police officers then informed Rajendran that the name was “confirmed.”[^10]

19     Rajendran proceeded to issue the accused with a Notice to Attend Court (NTAC) for a compoundable offence. This took place around 7.10pm, 40 minutes after the police arrived[^11]. As the littering offence was observed around 5.50pm and Rajendran must have confronted the accused a few minutes later, this meant that the entire incident took about 80 minutes.

## Defence Version

20     The accused did not dispute the chronology of events provided by the prosecution or the amount of time taken to resolve the incident. The accused also did not dispute the fact that he initially refused to provide his particulars to Rajendran. Instead, he disputed the Prosecution’s claim that Rajendran produced his authorisation card when he identified himself as an NEA officer.

## Findings of Fact by the Court

21     I found that the prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Rajendran had identified himself as an NEA officer and produced his authorisation card:

> 21.1     Rajendran and Valmond were credible witnesses whose evidence was internally consistent and also consistent with each other’s evidence as well as evidence of the police officers who subsequently arrived at the scene.

> 21.2     The accused’s conduct was inconsistent with his claim that he refused to co-operate because Rajendran did not show his authorisation card. If the accused believed that Rajendran was an imposter, why did the accused not call the police? The accused also knew that Rajendran had called for the police which was why he cancelled his delivery job and waited. Did the accused actually believe that an imposter would call the police?

> 21.3     When the police arrived, this removed all doubt that Rajendran and Valmond were genuine NEA officers. Sgt Teo testified that even though he had confirmed that Rajendran was an NEA officer,[^12] the accused still refused to provide his particulars.

> 21.4     SSSgt Rossdeli testified that the accused informed him that he did not provide his particulars because he denied committing the offence.[^13]

> 21.5     All of this suggests that the accused was fully aware that Rajendran was an NEA officer and that the accused’s refusal to provide particulars had nothing to do with any uncertainty about whether or not Rajendran was an imposter.

## Issue: Whether the conduct element and fault element of the charge is made out

22     Given that I had accepted the prosecution’s version of what transpired on 19 April 2018, the remaining issue was whether the accused’s conduct in refusing to provide his particulars amounted to the offence of hindering NEA officers in the execution of their duties and whether he had the requisite _mens rea_ or fault element.

23     As a starting point, I accepted the prosecution’s definition of “hinder” as set out in their submissions:

> To ‘hinder’ means to cause some appreciable interference with the performance of the officer’s duty. If the officer is frustrated in his attempt to perform his duty or retarded in the execution thereof, then clearly, he has been hindered. A hindrance which is or may be surmounted, is no less of a hindrance: _Foo Siang Wah Frederick v PP \[1999\] 1 SLR (R.) 996.[^14]_

24     I noted that the High Court in _Foo Siang Wah Frederick_ stated at \[54\] that the Penal Code offence of obstructing a public servant and the analogous offence under the Prevention of Corruption both required _mens rea_ and were not strict liability offences. I adopted a similar approach and proceeded on the basis that the present s.82(a) offence was not one of strict liability and that _mens rea_ was required.

## Prosecution’s Submissions on the Issue

25     According to the prosecution’s amended submissions:[^15]

> 25.1     Rajendran witnessed the accused littering. After stopping the accused, Rajendran told him that he was from the NEA and that he had committed littering and asked for his particulars.

> 25.2     The accused refused to provide his particulars. By virtue of sections 21 and 88 of the EPHA, NEA officers are empowered to effect an arrest when the accused refuses to provide his personal particulars. This is to allow the officers to take enforcement action.[^16]

> 25.3     The accused was placed under arrest by Rajendran and Valmond.[^17] The accused was not specifically informed that he was being placed under arrest because that “may not be proportionate to the offence and such an approach may seem too high-handed.” [^18]

> 25.4     Rajendran called for police assistance as the accused refused to provide his particulars. When the police arrived, the accused initially refused to give his particulars to the NEA officers though he appeared willing to provide his particulars to the police. Eventually, the accused provided his particulars to the NEA officers. The incident took about 2 hours[^19] because of the accused’s behavior.

> 25.5     The accused’s refusal to provide his particulars had therefore caused undue delay to the enforcement action because of his unruly behavior and refusal to provide his personal particulars upon the officers’ lawful request.[^20]

## Analysis

26     I analysed the incident as three separate stages:

> 26.1     Stage I: When Rajendran first approached the accused.

> 26.2     Stage II: The NEA officers called for police assistance after the accused refused to provide his particulars

> 26.3     Stage III: Police Officers arrive

#### Stage I: When Rajendran first approached the accused

27     When Rajendran first approached the accused, he informed the accused that he had committed a littering offence and requested his particulars, Rajendran did not inform the accused at that stage that he was being placed under arrest or that he would be “charged” for an offence. Rajendran also did not testify in Court of his intention to arrest the accused. Instead Rajendran politely asked the accused, “may I have your particulars?”[^21]

28     The NEA officers at this stage were merely engaging the accused to elicit his voluntary co-operation instead of relying on the procedure found in sections 21(1) and 21(2) of the Act which deals with the issuing of a Notice to Attend Court.

29     Section 86(1) empowers the NEA officers to demand the particulars of a person who is charged with an offence under the Act. The prosecution relied on this provision to show that the NEA officers had made a ‘lawful request’[^22] for particulars. Under the section, a demand for particulars can only be made from a person who is ‘charged’ with an offence.

> **Authorised officers may demand names and addresses in certain cases**

> 86.—(1)    Any person who is charged by any police officer or authorised officer with any offence under this Act shall on demand give his name and address and other proof of identity to the police officer or authorised officer, if so required.

30     The prosecution took the position that “charged” refers to a situation where a person has been “accused of” or “alleged to” to have committed an offence and confirmed that there were no case authorities that have dealt with this issue. [^23]

31     Referring to the dictionary definition, the verb “charge” means to “to make a **_formal_** statement saying that someone is accused of a crime.”[^24] Given the legal consequences that flow from an accused being “charged”, I was of the view that not every accusation or allegation would amount to the accused being “charged” with an offence. In my view, an accusation or allegation made by the NEA officers pursuant to the procedure set out in the Act would satisfy the definition of “charged” under s.86(1).

32     Given that the NEA officers were at this point not relying on the formal procedure laid set out in sections 21(1) and 21(2)[^25], I found that the prosecution had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had at this point been “charged” with an offence. Given that he had not been “charged” with an offence, the NEA officers at this stage would not be able to make demand for particulars under s.86(1). Therefore, the issue of the accused “hindering” the NEA officers by refusing their “lawful request” had not arisen yet.

#### Stage II: The NEA officers called for police assistance after the accused continued to refuse to provide his particulars

33     The accused declined to provide his particulars and Rajendran informed him that he would be calling for police assistance. Even though the accused was not specifically informed that he was under arrest, it was clear to the accused at this stage that he was not free to leave and had to wait for the police to arrive. The accused appeared to accept that he could not leave as he returned the food order that he was supposed to deliver.[^26] Therefore, I found that the prosecution had proven that the accused had been placed under arrest at this stage of the incident, notwithstanding the fact that this was never mentioned by the NEA officers (either to the accused, to the Police officers, or in their Court testimony[^27]).

34     Section 88 of the Act makes it clear that an NEA officer _may_ arrest someone who committed a littering offence in his view if that person declines to provide his particulars:

> 88.—(1)    Any police officer or authorised officer may arrest any person committing in his view or who he has reason to believe has committed any offence punishable under this Act if —

>> (a)    the name and address of the person are unknown to him;

>> (b)    the person declines to give his name and address; or

>> (c)    there is reason to doubt the accuracy of the name and address, if given.

> (2)    A person arrested under this section may be detained until his name and address are correctly ascertained.

> (3)    No person arrested under this section shall be detained longer than is necessary for bringing him before a court unless the order of a court for his detention is obtained.

35     Given that the accused had been placed under arrest at this stage pursuant to the Act, this would amount to a formal accusation or allegation that the accused had committed an offence. Therefore, I found the accused had been ‘charged’ with an offence by this stage. This meant that from this point on, requests by the NEA officers for particulars may amount to a demand for particulars pursuant to s.86(1).

36     After the police were called at about 6.10pm, Phua Jian Zhi arrived at about 6.15pm and met the accused. Phua asked Rajendran for proof that he was an NEA officer but Rajendran declined to show Phua his authorisation card.[^28] Phua then told the accused not to provide his particulars to the NEA officers.[^29] Did the accused’s refusal to provide particulars at this stage satisfy the conduct and fault requirements of s.82(a)?

37     I begin the analysis by noting that it was not clear whether the accused had been specifically informed that the NEA officers were making a demand for his particulars:

> 37.1     Rajendran never mentioned in his testimony that he had informed the accused that he was making a “demand” for the accused’s particulars. Similarly, he never informed the accused that he was legally obliged to provide his particulars and that he would be committing an offence if he did not do so.

> 37.2     Instead of informing the accused that he was legally obliged to provide his particulars under the Act (i.e. s.86(1)), Rajendran merely told the accused that if he did not give his particulars, the ticket may become non-compoundable.[^30]

> 37.3     I also noted that the charge refers to a “lawful _request_” for particulars instead of a _demand_ for particulars under s.86(1).

38     There is of course nothing wrong with Rajendran making a polite request for particulars in order to elicit co-operation. But if co-operation was not forthcoming, perhaps Rajendran should have informed the accused of his legal obligation under s.86(1). For certain offences where there the suspect is legally obliged to do something, there are examples of law enforcement agencies warning the suspect of his legal obligation and the consequences that follow from a refusal.[^31] NEA does not appear to have an equivalent procedure for s.86(1).

39     While the failure to warn the accused of the consequences of failing to provide his particulars may not necessarily be a defence to a charge under s.86(1), it raises the issue of the accused’s _mens rea_ where a charge of _hindering_ under s.82(a) is concerned. In particular, if the accused believed that Rajendran was giving him a choice, this raises the issue of whether he had the intention to hinder the NEA officers:

> 39.1     Choice 1: Give particulars and ticket will be compoundable.

> 39.2     Choice 2: Do not give particulars and wait for the Police. Ticket will be non-compoundable.

40     In fact, these ‘choices’ that Rajendran offered to the accused mirror the scheme of section 21 which provides for a person who is arrested for a s.17 littering offence to be produced before a Court _unless_ he provides his particulars, in which case, the NEA officer _may_ issue him a Notice to Attend Court instead:

> **Notice to attend Court**

> 21.—(1)    Any person who commits an offence under section 17, 18, 19 or 20 may be arrested without warrant by any police officer or authorised officer, and taken before a Magistrate’s Court or a District Court

> ...

> (2)    Notwithstanding subsection (1) or any other written law, any police officer or authorised officer who, having effected an arrest in accordance with this section, is satisfied as to the identity, name and place of residence of the person arrested, may, instead of taking that person before a Court or to a police station, serve upon that person a notice in such form as may be prescribed under section 108 requiring the person to attend at the Court described at the hour and on the date specified in the notice.

> (3)    For the purpose of satisfying himself as to the identity of the person arrested, the police officer or authorised officer may require the person to furnish such evidence of identity as he may consider necessary.

41     In the present case, the accused elected not to provide his particulars. This meant that the NEA officers, having already arrested the accused whose particulars they could not ascertain, were statutorily obliged to detain him and produce him before a Court within 48 hours of his arrest.[^32] There was no evidence that the accused was resisting arrest or hindering the NEA Officers from carrying out their statutory duty to detain and produce him before a Court.

42     However, the Prosecution in their submissions stated that the NEA officers could not do so as they were not equipped with handcuffs or restraints and did not have the appropriate vehicle for transporting suspects.[^33] Therefore, the NEA officers had to wait for Police assistance to arrive.

43     I find that at Stage II, the accused did not hinder the NEA officers. Rajendran did not inform the accused that he was legally obliged to provide his particulars but instead told him that the offence may be non-compoundable if he refused to provide his particulars. As the accused was given a choice, this would also mean that he did not have an intention to hinder. The accused chose the non-compoundable option and co-operated by waiting for the Police to arrive given that the NEA officers were not equipped to transport the accused to a Police station.

#### Stage III: Police Officers arrive on the scene

44     Senior Staff Sergeant Rossdeli Bin Kasman (PW3) and Sergeant Teo Keng Hui (PW4, “Sgt Teo”) arrived at the scene at around 6.30pm.

45     After an accused is placed under arrest for a littering offence, the Act states that:

> 45.1     Section 21(2): If he subsequently provides his particulars, the NEA officers do not need take the person to a Court or to a police station. Instead, the NEA officers _may_ issue him a Notice to Attend Court.

> 45.2     Section 88(2) of the Act: If he does not provide his particulars after being arrested, the NEA officers may detain him for the purpose of bringing him before a court. This would be subject to the timeline set out in Article 9(4) of the Constitution.

46     The accused was not resisting arrest. After arresting the accused, the NEA officers and Police officers were free to carry out their statutory duty by bringing the accused to a Police Station or before a Court.

47     The prosecution did not elicit from the witnesses what Rajendran told the Police officers, but SSgt Rossdeli and Sgt Teo both confirmed that there was no mention that the accused had been placed under arrest.[^34] If the police officers were informed that the accused had already been placed under arrest, whether for an offence under s.17(1) or s.86(1), the accused would have to be brought to a police station or produced before a Court. Sgt Teo confirmed that in cases where they encounter a suspect who does not provide his particulars, they will bring the suspect back the Police Station.[^35]

48     The actions of the Police officers show that they were not informed by Rajendran of the accused’s obligation to provide particulars under s.86(1) or that he was under arrest.

49     Sgt Teo obtained the accused’s particulars. Instead of handing the particulars to the NEA officers, she took the position that she could not provide these particulars to the NEA officers unless the accused consented.[^36] Sgt Teo testified that she told the accused:

> _\[I\]t’s his_ **_choice_** _whether he want to give the particulars, if he do not want to give, then it will become a Court case, if not can just accept the summon, then go for the appeal._ [^37] (emphasis added)

50     From the accused’s perspective, he was given a choice by the Police Officers whether or not to provide his particulars and this would have been consistent with what Rajendran told him earlier about the case becoming non-compoundable if he did not provide his particulars.[^38] A similar analysis to stage II is applicable here. The accused did not hinder and did not have an intention to hinder. He had provided his particulars to Sgt Teo but initially declined to provide them to the NEA officers because he was given a choice instead of being told that he was legally obliged to provide his particulars. He was not even told that he was under arrest.

## Conclusion: Accused did not hinder

51     The incident happened in the evening in the vicinity of a busy shopping mall and cinema and would have been witnessed by many members of the public. The NEA officers must be commended for not adopting a ‘high-handed’[^39] approach in dealing with a relatively minor offence. Instead of proceeding according to the strict letter of the law, they preferred persuasion over coercion. Even though this approach was more time consuming, it was ultimately successful and can only serve to increase public trust and confidence in our enforcement agencies. But after electing to take the time to engage and persuade the accused (instead of arresting and bringing the accused to a Police station), can the NEA then say that the accused “hindered” the NEA officers in the execution of their duties?

52     While the accused did not hinder the NEA officers, this does not mean that accused persons can refuse to provide their particulars without any consequences. As I have noted, NEA officers may arrest a person for an offence of failing to provide his particulars under s.86(1) if the requirements of the provision are satisfied. If this occurs, the accused would have to be brought to a Police station and detained until he provides his particulars.[^40] Furthermore, he may be liable to be charged in Court for the offence. It would seem that the mere mention of this possibility would be sufficient in most cases to elicit co-operation. It is therefore curious that the NEA officers did not inform the accused of this once it became clear that he did not wish to co-operate.

53     If the Prosecution was of the view that an accused person had gone further and harassed or abused the officers, additional charges under the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A) could have been preferred.

#### Amendment of charge to s.86(1)

54     The prosecution did not make any submissions on whether the Court could have convicted the accused on a charge under s.86(1) instead of the original charge under s.82(a). The power of a Court to do so is found in s.141(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code but would only be available if the s.86(1) if found to be a “lesser offence.” The prosecution also stated in their submissions that the NEA does _not_ as a matter of practice prefer a charge under s.86(1) if the accused eventually provides his particulars.[^41]

55     In the circumstances, I did not consider the issue of a conviction on a lesser charge.

## Verdict

56     Given the above findings, I acquitted the accused of the charge of hindering the NEA officers. The accused was convicted of the littering charge and he has since paid the fine imposed.
