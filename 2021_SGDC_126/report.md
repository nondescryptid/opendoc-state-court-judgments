### Principal District Judge Toh Han Li:

## Introduction

1       The accused claimed trial to a single charge of driving his motor trailer (‘trailer”) without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road thereby causing hurt to a motorcyclist under section 65(1)(b) and punishable under section 65(4)(a) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) (“RTA”):

>     You…. are charged that on 05th November 2019 at or about 8.34 p.m., along Seletar Expressway (SLE) towards Bukit Timah Expressway (BKE) near 3.36km Singapore, did drive a motor trailer bearing registration number XB6778E (“the Trailer”) on a road without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road, _to wit_, by failing to keep a proper lookout when changing lanes to the right, and this resulted in the Trailer colliding into a motorcycle bearing registration number DDG531, thus causing hurt to one Muhammad Ansari Bin Ramli, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 65(1)(b) punishable under Section 65(4)(a) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) (“RTA”).

## The Prosecution ’s case

2       On 5 November 2019, PW3 Muhammad Ansari Bin Ramli (“the victim”) was riding home from work on his motorcycle when he was injured in a road traffic accident.

3       The main Prosecution witnesses for the trial were the victim and another motorcyclist, PW 4 Rhuban Chandran who was travelling behind the victim and who witnessed the accident.

4       The victim testified that on 5 November 2019, he left his place of work at FedEx at 90 Alps Avenue in Loyang to return to Johor Bahru, Malaysia. He was travelling on his motorcycle on either lane 2 or 3 along the Seletar Expressway at about 8.35pm with his motorcycle headlights switched on. At that time, it was drizzling, traffic conditions were normal and there was no traffic jam. The victim was travelling at 60-70 km/h.

5       As he was travelling along Seletar Expressway, the accused’s trailer, which was travelling on the victim’s left side, signalled for around 2 seconds and suddenly moved to the right into the victim’s lane. The victim panicked and tried to avoid the accused’s trailer but could not swerve right as there was a car travelling in the lane on the victim’s right. As a result, the rear part of the accused’s trailer collided into the left side of the victim’s motorcycle. Under cross-examination, the victim disagreed with the accused’s contention that the accused was riding along lane 3 and the victim was in lane 4, when the victim subsequently filtered into lane 3 resulting in the collision.

6       As a result of the collision, the victim fell of his motorcycle and suffered injuries, with the right side of the motorcycle hitting the road. He lost consciousness after the accident and regained consciousness only a month later.

7       The relative positions of the accused’s trailer and the victim’s motorcycle after the accident as well as the relevant lane numbers are depicted in the sketch plan P6 below. This was prepared by PW7 AETOS auxiliary police officer Muhmmad Fadly Bin Sulaiman of the traffic enforcement division who was the first police officer on the scene. In P6 the accused’s trailer was designed as “1” and the victim’s motorcycle was designated as “2”.

8       Sgt David Yap (PW1) was the investigating officer of the case. Upon arrival at the scene, he noticed that the accused’s trailer was in lane 3 facing the direction of traffic and the victim’s motorcycle was in lane 3, upright and facing against the flow of traffic.

9       Station Inspector Govindarajoo (PW2) was attached to the forensic division of the traffic police and took photographs of the scene (P2 1-47). P2-17 shows the accused’s trailer while P2-40 shows the victim’s motorcycle. P2-4 depicts the relative positions of the accused’s trailer and the victim’s motorcycle, with the victim’s motorcycle in the foreground and the accused’s

![]([2021] SGDC 0126_Image/[2021] SGDC 0126_image4.png)

10     Rhuban Chandran worked as a security guard in the same company (FedEx) as the victim as an X-ray operator. Although he had seen the victim during smoke breaks, he had neither interacted nor spoken with the victim and did not consider him as a friend. On 5 November 2019, Rhuban Chandran left FedEx two to three minutes after the victim and was travelling on his motorcycle behind the victim at a speed of around 80 to 90 km/h.

11     At about 8.35pm, Rhuban Chandran was travelling towards the Seletar Expressway and was riding behind the victim in lane 2. He then noticed a trailer changing lanes from lane 4 to lane 3, resulting in the right rear corner of the trailer colliding into the left and front of the victim’s motorcycle. At that time, the victim was travelling between lane 2 and 3 behind the trailer. Rhuban Chandran’s evidence was that the victim’s motorcycle lights were switched on at the material time. He did not notice if the driver of the trailer had signalled when he changed lanes.

12     After the collision, the handle of victim’s motorcycle turned to face the opposite direction of the traffic flow and fell on its right side. The victim also fell. He then parked his motorcycle next to the victim’s motorcycle and noted that the victim was unconscious. Subsequently, the Singapore Civil Defence Force and the police arrived and took down his particulars and he told them what he had seen. Rhuban Chandran disagreed with the accused’s contention under cross-examination that the accused did not change lanes and it was the victim who had in fact collided into the accused’s trailer. Rhuban Chandran maintained that it was the accused who had collided into the victim while the accused was changing lanes.

13     PW 5 Dr Francesca Th’ng prepared medical report P4 on the victim on the basis of clinical notes written by Dr Donovan Yang and Dr Vinoban Amirthalingam. P4 noted that the victim was seen at the Acute and Emergency Care Centre of Khoo Teck Puat Hospital on 5 November 2019. On arrival, the victim was mouthing incoherent words and had laboured breathing. The victim was intubated as he had severe lactic acidosis, with dilated pupils and an altered mental state. P4 concluded that the victim suffered a minor head injury and superficial wounds secondary to a road traffic accident. The victim was then transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit ward of Khoo Teck Puat Hospital for further management.

14     PW 6 Dr Kang Minli prepared medical report P5 on the victim and testified that the victim was admitted to the Department of General Surgery at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital on 5 November 2019 as they were unable to ascertain the cause for his not being fully conscious. Dr Kang attended to the victim on that occasion. When asked if it was possible that the victim could not remember events right after the collision and during his stay at the hospital she replied “yes”. The victim was found to have multiple abrasions over his right eyebrow, right parietal region, bilateral hands and right knee as well as a left pinna laceration. The victim was transferred to an external hospital in Johor Bahru on 9 November 2019 to continue treatment at the request of the victim’s family. The victim was given hospitalization leave from 5 Nov 2019 to 9 Dec 2019. Dr Kang confirmed that the injuries were congruent with that of a road traffic accident.

15     At the close of the prosecution’s case, as I was satisfied that there was some evidence, not inherently incredible, which satisfied each and every element of the charge, I called for the accused to enter his defence.

## The accused’s evidence

16     The accused was the only witness for the Defence.

17     The accused testified that he worked as a delivery driver for SS Logistics Private Limited and his working hours were from 8.00 am to 5.00 pm. On 5 November 2019 he was working till 8.00 pm as he had to unload goods at a construction site in Sengkang East.

18     After leaving the construction site, he was driving from Sengkang East towards Jurong to return his trailer which was a 18-wheel trailer about 12 metres long. When asked to confirm if he was rushing to Jurong he replied “yes’[^1].

19     He was driving on the Tampines Expressway towards the Seletar Expressway where changed lanes to lane 3 and was travelling at a speed of roughly 60km/h.

20     While he was travelling on lane 3, he saw the victim’s motorcycle changing lanes from lane 4 to lane 3 through his rear view mirror. At that time the victim was about 10 m behind him. He said that beside him there was a sedan which had blared its horn. After the blaring of the horn he looked back using his rear view mirror and saw the victim’s motorcycle had fallen down and he stopped his trailer. Someone had called the police and when the police arrived, the accused was subsequently handcuffed and brought to the police station.

21     He denied that he was executing a lane change at the time of the collision and was simply proceeding along lane 3.

22     The accused did not dispute the injuries suffered by the victim.

## The Prosecution’s closing submissions

23     The Prosecution submitted that the victim was an honest and forthright witness who had given a cogent account of the accident and was internally consistent. Although there was some parts of his evidence where he was unable to recall, such as which exact lane he was traveling in, the prosecution submitted that the accident had affected victim’s memory and adequate allowance must be accorded to human fallibility in retention and recollection, as observed by Yong CJ in _PP v Singh Kalpanath_ \[1995\] 3 SLR (R) 158 at \[60\]:

>     Adequate allowance must be accorded to the human fallibility in retention and recollection. It is also common to find varying accounts of the same incident by the same person. No one can describe the same thing exactly in the same way over and over again: see _Chean Siong Guat v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1969\] 2 MLJ 63</span>, at 63–64.

24     The Prosecution submitted that the victim’s account was corroborated in all material aspects by the evidence of Rhuban Chandran, who was an independent witness who had provided a detailed account of the accident. In response to an allegation by the accused that Rhuban Chandran might have falsely implicated him, Rhuban Chandran was recalled as a rebuttal witness and he clarified that although he worked at the same company as the victim he had never spoken to the victim and did not consider him as a friend. The accused had also alleged that the victim and Rhuban Chandran were from the same hometown but Rhuban Chandran was from Malacca while the victim was from Johor Bahru. Rhuban Chandran did not even know the nationality of the victim.

25     As for the defence, the Prosecution submitted that the accused’s version of events could not be believed. The Prosecution submitted that the accused’s own evidence in court had changed when he initially said that saw the victim’s motorcycle changing lanes from lane 4 to lane 3 but later said that he did not see the design or colour of the motorcycle that changed lanes and as there were a few motorcycles along SLE at that time he could not be certain if it was the victim’s motorcycle that he had seen. Further he had not mentioned in his statement to the police P10 that he had seen the victim’s motorcycle change lanes.

## The accused’s closing submissions

26     The accused maintained that he had not changed lanes as alleged by the victim and Rhuban Chandran. He submitted that the victim and Rhuban Chandran were not reliable witnesses for the following reasons:

> a)     Rhuban Chandran’s evidence as to which part of the accused’s trailer had struck the victim’s motorcycle was inconsistent.

> b)     The victim testified that he was travelling at 60-70 km/h while Rhuban Chandran had testified that he was travelling 80-90 km/h which would mean that he could not be travelling behind the victim as the time of the accident.

> c)     The victim claimed that his trailer struck the motorcycle the left side by the vehicle damage report (“P7”) shows damage on the motorcycle’s right side.

> d)     There were no new scratches on his trailer as a result of the accident.

> e)     Being from the same hometown and company, Rhuban Chandran had tailored his evidence to favour the victim.

## The court’s decision on the charge

27     There was no dispute that the victim had sustained injuries as a result of a road traffic accident. This was clear from the medical reports P4 and P5. The key disputed issue in this trial was _how_ the victim came to sustain his injuries. In this regard, the prosecution and the defence witnesses’ version were diametrically opposed to each other. The victim and Rhuban Chandran’s testified that the accused changed lanes from lane 4 to lane 3 resulting in a collision between the accused’s trailer and the victim’s motorcycle. The accused’s version is that he did not change lanes, had remained in lane 3 and that it was the victim who had changed lanes from lane 4 to lane 3 and had collided into him.

28     Having reviewed the evidence, I was of the view that the victim and Rhuban Chandran’s evidence were consistent in material areas, in that the accused has moved from lane 4 to lane 3 which then collided with the victim’s motorcycle. Contrary to the accused’s submission, I did not find Rhuban Chandran’s testimony as to which part of the trailer had struck the victim’s motorcycle as being inconsistent. Rhuban Chandran testified that the point of collision was the right rear corner of the accused’s trailer with the front of the victim’s motorcycle. Rhuban Chandran maintained throughout his evidence that it was the accused who had collided into the victim while the accused changing lanes.

29     As for the alleged discrepancy in speeds as testified by the victim and Rhuban Chandran, in my view this was not a material discrepancy as each of them were giving their own individual estimates of their respective travelling speeds and in any event, their speeds may not always have been constant in this regard.

30     The key point is that Rhuban Chandran had maintained in his evidence that he was always travelling behind the victim on this aspect[^2]:

> Q    Yes, one is at the speed of 80, one was at the speed of 60. The speed of 80 was fast---is faster than the speed of 60. How is it possible that you kept trailing behind the victim?

> A    I confirm that I was travelling between 80 to 90 kilometres per hour. **The victim might have slowed down his motorbike prior to the accident, but I never overtook him, I was always behind him. I remember that clearly.**

\[emphasis added\]

31     As for damage to the victim’s motorcycle, Rhuban Chandran had testified as follows[^3]:

> Q    Witness, just now, you mentioned that after the collision, the motorcyclist fell on his left, the motorcycle also fell on the left side, but the handle turned and it landed on the right side. Do you confirm that, that was what you said just now?

> A    Yes, I confirm.

32     Rhuban Chandran further elaborated as follows[^4]:

> Q    When you say that the whole motorbike turned, where was the front of the motorbike facing?

> A    It was facing me.

> Q    So, when you said that it fell to the left, are you talking about falling to the left from your point of view? Or are you talking about falling to the l---

> A    From my point of view, on the left side.

33     With regard to the accused’s submission there were no new scratches to the trailer, PW8 Mohd Ridhuan Bin Mohd Akhbar, a AETOS land marshal traffic outrider had prepared the vehicle damage reports P7 (victim’s motorcycle) and P8 (accused’s trailer). He also testified that some of the scratches and minor dents might have been caused by the accident. He also testified that as there were many scratches on the accused’s trailer and he was not able to distinguish between old and new scratches.

34     As for whether there was any reason for Rhuban Chandran to give false evidence to implicate the accused, I found that there was no reason for Rhuban Chandran to do so as they had never spoken to each other even though they worked at the same company and were not friends, nor did they originate from the same hometown in Malaysia as alleged by the accused.

35     I accordingly accepted the victim’s account of the accident as corroborated by the witness Rhuban Chandran that the accused had changed lanes from lane 4 to lane 3 resulting in a collision between the accused’s trailer and the victim’s motorcycle.

36     The accused’s version of events was diametrically opposed to the account of the victim and Rhuban Chandran. The accused’s version suggested that it was the victim who to blame for the accident by filtering from lane 4 to lane 3 and then colliding into the accused’s trailer who was constantly travelling on lane 3. The following exchange was put by the accused to the victim under cross-examination[^5]:

>   
| 

Q (Accused)

 | 

You were on lane 4 and I do not know why you did not want to travel on lane 4 and hence, you changed lanes to lane 3.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Okay. Okay, let’s stop here. Okay. So, refer him to the sketch plan A and say that---Mr. Dong Tao said he was on lane 3 and the witness was on lane 4 and changed to lane 3. Does he agree with that? That means he filtered from left to right, the---the---

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

I disagree.

 |

  
  

37     Thereafter, the accused was not internally consistent on his own version of events. Despite initially claiming that it was the victim who had changed lanes from lane 4 to lane 3 resulting in the victim falling down, under cross examination by the DPP, he backpeddled and said that he did not notice the colour of the motorcycle not did he see it fall down[^6]:

> A    When I was travelling, I saw it but I did not know that this was the motorcycle. I stopped, I walked back, and I saw that this was the motorcycle.

> Q    When you allegedly saw this mo---when---when you allegedly saw a motorcycle changing lanes behind you, did you see its design?

> A    I did not see.

> Q    Did you see its colour?

> A    I did not notice.

38     In his statement to the police (P10) there was no mention of him seeing the victim or any motorcycle changing lines before the collision. This is what the accused stated in P10 to the police:

>     On 05/11/2019 at about 8.00pm, I had left Seng Kang East Dr and was headed for a refinery plant at Pioneer area. I was at Seng Kang East Dr for a delivery. I had drove along TPE towards the direction of SLE and I merged into SLE. As I was merging into SLE, I had made a land change straight into lane 3. After which, I continued to drive along SLE towards BKE and I had passed by the exit of Lentor Avenue when I suddenly heard someone sounding their horn.

>     Upon hearing multiple horn sounds, I immediately looked at my left and right side mirrors and I noticed that there were a few vehicles stationary behind me. I slowed down and came to a stop slightly ahead and immediately alighted from my vehicle. I came down from my vehicle and notice that there was a motorcyclist rider lying on lane 3 of 4. I approached the rider but the rider was surrounded by some unknown passerby. They were attending to the rider and there was an unknow male Chinese passerby who informed that the ambulance had been notified.

39     It is pertinent to note from the above passages in P 10 that there was no mention whatsoever about the victim changing lanes immediately before the accident. When asked by the DPP why he did not mention the victim changing lanes from lane 4 to lane 3 in his statement P10, the accused said that it was not asked of him and hence he did not answer. With respect, the recorder of P10 had asked a general question of “What do you know about the facts of this case?” and this would be the opportunity for the accused to give his full account of the incident including a material fact such as his seeing the victim changing lanes and colliding into him.

40     In P10 he was further asked if he made any lane change and he stated that he did not but made no mention of the victim changing lanes:

> Q4)    Did you make any lane change while you were travelling along SLE towards BKE?

> A4)    No, I did not. The only time I made a lane change was when I merged into SLE from TPE. From there on, I continued to travel on lane 3 up till the point where I stopped my vehicle.

41     Given that there was no mention by the accused in P10 of the victim changing lanes and colliding into his trailer before the accident, I found that this was an afterthought which was only mentioned at trial, and as discussed above, he was not even internally consistent on this aspect of his evidence.

42     I accordingly reject the accused’s varying accounts in court and in P10 of how the collision happened as not being credible.

43     I would add that the final positions of the accused’s trailer and the victim’s motorcycle as depicted in P6 where the accused was in lane 3 and the victim’s motorcycle was at the right edge of lane 3 near to lane 2 coheres more with the victim and Rhuban Chandran’s account than the accused’s account. The reason being that if the accused’s account was to be accepted (that the victim moved from lane 4 to lane 3 and collided into the accused’s trailer) , it would be more likely that the victim’s motorcycle would be at the left side of lane 3 nearer to lane 4.

44     In accepting the victim and Rhuban Chandran’s version of events and rejecting the accused’s version of events, I found that the accused had failed to keep a proper lookout when changing lanes to the right from lane 4 to lane 3 into the victim’s lane, resulting in a collision with the victim’s motorcycle resulting in hurt being caused to the victim.

45     I accordingly convicted the accused of the charge.

## Antecedents

46     The accused did not have any known antecedents.

## The sentence

### Prosecution’s submission on sentence

47     The prosecution submitted the present offence has been committed after the amendments to the RTA came into effect on 1 November 2019.

48     The prosecution relied on the case of _PP v Cullen Richard Alexander_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 88</span> (“_Cullen_”) at \[70\] and \[75\] – \[78\] where the district court held that the amendments to the RTA were intended to make our roads safer and deter individuals from driving in an irresponsible manner by increasing the minimum mandatory sentences, the maximum sentences and the minimum mandatory disqualification periods, thus keeping irresponsible motorists off the roads for a longer period.

49     The level of harm caused would usually refer to the nature and degree of injury caused to the victim as well as the damage caused to property. The level of potential harm that might have resulted by the offender’s conduct is also relevant in this assessment (_Cullen_ at \[94\]).

50     As regards the offender’s degree of culpability, the court adopted the following working definition in relation to the level of culpability in _Cullen_:

![]([2021] SGDC 0126_Image/[2021] SGDC 0126_image5.png)

51     The prosecution submitted that the culpability of the accused was at the higher end of the low category. This is because he was driving a long and heavy vehicle would have given him greater reason to exercise care when executing the lane change.

52     The prosecution submitted that the harm caused in this case was medium:

> (a)     The victim suffered multiple superficial abrasions over his right eyebrow, right parietal region, bilateral hands and right knee, all of which were conservatively managed with dressings.

> (b)     He also suffered a left ear laceration that underwent suturing, a left supraorbital laceration, and a minor head injury.

> (c)     The victim was given 35 days of hospitalisation leave.

53     The prosecution also relied on the following sentencing precedents (all plead guilty cases):

54     The prosecution submitted that the case of _PP v Lee He Ye_ was similar to the present case given that both involved accused persons who had caused collisions while changing lanes on an expressway. Whilst there were three victims in _Lee He Ye_, the injuries sustained by the present victim were more serious than those suffered by the victims in _Lee He Ye_. Further, the accused was driving a heavy vehicle (a trailer) whilst the offender in _Lee He Ye_ was driving a motor car. The prosecution also submitted that the offender in _Lee He Ye_ pleaded guilty whereas the present accused claimed trial to the charge and was thus not entitled to a plead guilty sentencing discount.

55     The prosecution accordingly sought the maximum fine of $2,500 and an order that the accused be disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of at least 18 months.

### Mitigation

56     The accused did not make any submission on the quantum of fine sought by the prosecution but asked the court not to impose disqualification order. The accused submitted that his family of 5 depended on him to earn money for them. He hoped that he could continue to work in Singapore as it was difficult for him to return to home country to work as he would need to quarantine for 28 days.

### The court’s decision on sentence

57     Section 65 of the RTA was recently amended on 1 November 2019.

58     Section 65(1) and 65(4)(a) RTA provides as follows:

> 65.—(1)    If any person drives a motor vehicle on a road —

>> (a)    without due care and attention; or

>> (b)    without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road, the person (called the offender) shall be guilty of an offence.

> (4)    If hurt is caused to another person by the driving of a motor vehicle by the offender, the offender shall on conviction of an offence under subsection (1) —

>> (a)    be liable to a fine not exceeding $2,500 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both…

59     Under s 42(1) RTA, a court before which a person is convicted of any offence in connection with the driving of a motor vehicle may order him to be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for life or for such period as the court may think fit.

60     Prior to the 1 November 2019 amendments to the RTA, motorises who caused hurt by negligent driving were typically charged under s 337(b) Penal Code , which was causing hurt by a negligent act. The penalty under s337(b) Penal Code is a fine of up to $2,500 or with imprisonment up to 6 months or both.

61     As compared to s 337(b) Penal Code, the maximum fine of $2500 remains the same under s 65(4)(a) RTA but the maximum imprisonment term that can be imposed is higher, at 12 months’ imprisonment.

62     The move towards more serious penalties can be gleaned from the Second Reading speech of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill No. 13/2019 by Mrs Josephine Teo, Second Minister for Home Affairs \[_Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (8 July 2019) vol. 94)\] where she stated as follows:

>     To make our roads safer, _we need stronger deterrence against irresponsible driving._ We will do this by: _(a) enhancing the criminal penalties for irresponsible driving_; and (b) tightening the regulatory regime against irresponsible driving…

>     However, irresponsible driving remains a big concern…

>     Why is this a problem? Because irresponsible driving can have deadly consequences. Even if victims survive the accident, they, or their families, may suffer long-term problems – sometimes, medical; sometimes, permanent disabilities…

>     Enforcement, education and road safety infrastructure must certainly continue to be improved. _But we also need stronger deterrence against irresponsible driving…_.

>     I will start with our _enhanced approach towards irresponsible driving offences_. Today, irresponsible driving offences are prosecuted in two ways. One way is under the Penal Code, for Rash Act and Negligent Act. Another way is under the RTA, for Reckless or Dangerous Driving, and Driving without Due Care or Reasonable Consideration. The penalties differ.

>     For better clarity and consistence, we propose to _consolidate driving offences under the RTA._ We will also streamline the offences into two classes: the first category is Reckless or Dangerous Driving, which I will refer to as Dangerous Driving in the rest of the speech. **The second category is Driving without Due Care or Reasonable Consideration, which I will refer to as** **_Careless Driving_****….**

>     Besides looking at the circumstances of the offence, **our enhanced approach will also consider the** **_level of harm caused_****. If the motorist causes more harm, the level of punishment will be higher.**

>      **There will be** **_four levels of harm_** **: Death**, **_Grievous Hurt_****, Hurt and Endangering Life**. Such tiering of harm is not new in our laws – the Penal Code already has it.

>     To summarise, we will enhance our overall approach to _penalise irresponsible driving_ depending on: _(a) the circumstances of the offence_ – whether it constitutes Dangerous Driving or Careless Driving; and _(b) the level of harm caused_ – whether they result in Death, Grievous Hurt, Hurt, or Endangering Life.

>     Let me move on to the penalties themselves. **Today, our penalties for irresponsible driving offences are generally less severe than on other jurisdictions….**

>      **_We also need to raise sentencing norms for egregious irresponsible driving offences_**, particularly those that result in death or some form of permanent disabilities.”

>     \[Emphasis added\]

63     In _Cullen_, the District Judge made the following observations with regard to the RTA amendments at \[69\]-\[72\]:

>     The rationale for the amendments to the RTA, which came into force on 1 November 2019, was presented during the Second Reading of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2019 \[Bill No. 13/2019\] in Parliament on 8 July 2019.

>     Generally, as highlighted by Prosecution, I agree that the Parliamentary intention to amend the RTA was for the need for a stronger deterrence against irresponsible driving to make our roads safer by enhancing criminal penalties. **The enhanced criminal penalties include introducing higher minimum mandatory sentences (including disqualification periods) to keep irresponsible motorists off the roads for a longer period** as well as higher maximum sentences as compared to the existing penalties under the Penal Code or the RTA (prior to the new amendments).

>     Another reason for the amendments is to consolidate driving offences previously prosecuted under the Penal Code, like rash and negligent acts, under the RTA. This will enable the offences to be streamlined under the RTA into (i) Reckless or Dangerous Driving under s64; and (ii) Driving without Due Care or Reasonable Consideration (also known as “Careless Driving”) under s65.

>     Besides the manner of driving or circumstances in which the traffic offence is committed, **the level of harm caused by the offender is also considered in the overall approach. The four levels of harm are (i) Death; (ii) Grievous hurt; (iii) Hurt; and (iv) Endangering life. Therefore, the greater the harm caused, the level of punishment will be higher.**

>     \[emphasis added\]

64     I agree with the above observations and by way of illustration, an offence under section 65(3)(a) RTA now imposes a _mandatory minimum disqualification of 5 years_ where _grievous hurt_ was caused as a result of driving without due care and attention or driving without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road pursuant to s 65(6)(d). The present charge under s 65(4)(a) RTA of causing _hurt_ as a result of driving without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road for which the accused had been convicted is one tier lower in terms of harm as compared to a s 65(3)(3) RTA offence of grievous hurt.

65     While there is no mandatory minimum disqualification period for a s 65(4)(a) RTA offence as opposed to the minimum of 5 years disqualification as required under s 65(3)(a) RTA, the Minister had explained at the Second Reading of the RTA amendments on the need for a _tiered punishment framework_ based on the level of harm caused with a higher punishment corresponding to a high level of harm. In the circumstances, given the starting point of 5 years disqualification for grievous hurt under s 65(3)(a) RTA, I am of the view that a disqualification order should generally still be imposed for the lesser offence of hurt under s 65(4)(a) RTA, whereby the length of the disqualification order would depend on the facts of each case taking into account offence and offender specific factors, with the 5 years minimum disqualification for s 65(3)(a) RTA offences operating as a soft upper boundary for a lesser offence of hurt under s 65(4)(a) RTA. In this regard, it is of note that the table of case precedents cited by the prosecution show that a disqualification order had been imposed by the court in _every case_ under s 65(4)(a) RTA.

66     Given that the accused in the present did signal but failed to keep a proper lookout and was driving a long trailer with the potential to cause greater harm should there be a collision, I agreed that with the prosecution that the accused’s culpability was at the higher end of low culpability. As for harm, the injuries of the victim were not slight, where he had lost consciousness after the accident and regained consciousness only a month later and had been given 35 days of hospitalisation leave. As such, I found that the harm was medium.

67     From the prosecution’s table of case precedents, the period of disqualification order ranged between 10 to 18 months. Specifically in _Lee He Ye_, where the victims were given between 4 to 12 days of medical leave, the offender was given 12 months’ disqualification in a plead guilty case.

68     In the circumstances, taking into account the accused’s culpability being at the higher end of low culpability as well as 35 days of hospitalisation leave given to the victim, and bearing in mind that the sentencing precedents were all plead guilty where a sentencing discount would have been given, I was of the view that a period of 15 month’s disqualification was in order.

69     I accordingly sentenced the accused to a fine of $2,500 (in default one week’s imprisonment) and for him to be disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licenses for a period of 15 months.

70     The fine and disqualification order have been stayed pending the appeal.
