8 June 2021 - Judgment reserved

### District Judge Clement Julien Tan Tze Ming:

1       The accused, Sautha Letchumi d/o Supramniam, 41 years old as at the date of this judgment, claimed trial to one charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt to her cousin, one Dione Kathie James. She is alleged to have done so in furtherance of a common intention with her sister, Santha Letchumi d/o Supramaniam (“Santha”). The charge against the accused was brought under Section 325, read with Section 34, of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.), and is framed as follows:

> You … are charged that, you on the 26th October 2016 at about 2.39am, at the vicinity of the void deck of Blk 96 Geylang Bahru Singapore 330096, together with Santha Letchumi D/O Supramaniam, and in the furtherance of the common intention of you all, did voluntarily cause grievous hurt to one Dione Kathie James, to wit, by slapping, kicking and using a bag to hit the said Dione Kathie James, thereby causing her to sustain a comminuted fracture of the nasal bone, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 325 read with Section 34 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.).

2       Seetha Letchumi d/o Supramniam (“Seetha”), another sister of the accused and Santha, was also complicit in the incident. Seetha was originally charged for the same offence. However, she pleaded guilty to a reduced charge for an offence under the Protection from Harassment Act in separate proceedings and was convicted and fined. Santha also pleaded guilty in separate proceedings to a reduced charge for an offence under Section 323 read with Section 34 of the Penal Code. She was sentenced to five months’ imprisonment. Seetha and Santha appeared as Sautha’s witnesses in these proceedings. Not only do they testify as to Sautha’s innocence. They have also denied their roles in the incident notwithstanding their convictions, and have sought to explain that they were compelled to plead guilty at the material time because of the circumstances they faced then. Various other issues were raised in the course of the trial, ranging from the manner in which the investigations were conducted, to allegations that the prosecution breached its disclosure obligations.

3       Having considered the evidence adduced in the course of this trial which spanned 35 days, and also the submissions of parties, I have decided to acquit the accused of the charge brought against her. I will set out in this judgment the reasons for reaching this verdict.

## Background facts

4       At about 11.00pm on 25 October 2016, Dione, the victim, was drinking with one Dinesh Kumar (“Dinesh” or “Paal”) at the void deck of Block 96 Geylang Bahru. Block 96 Geylang Bahru was Dinesh’s place of residence. It was Dione’s birthday the next day, i.e., on 26 October 2016. Dione and Dinesh met for celebratory drinks.[^1] At that time, Dione was married to one Ryan Mathew. She has six children. Dione claims that Dinesh was just a friend and that they had only started dating two years after the incident.[^2] Dinesh, however, readily admits that he was Dione’s boyfriend at that time.[^3]

5       Whilst Dinesh and Dione were having drinks, Dione received a call from Santha. What transpired during this telephone call forms the prelude to the incident at Block 96 Geylang Bahru. Insults, verbal abuse and vulgarities were hurled by Santha and Seetha at Dione. There is disagreement between the parties on whether the conversation was one-way, whether all three sisters were actively engaged on the call, and whether Dione had muted her phone. There is an audio recording of the phone call. Only the sisters’ voices can be heard on the recording. The prosecution’s case is that the audio recording contains the entire conversation between the parties. The defence, on the other hand, says that the audio recording had been edited.

6       Ultimately, it is not entirely clear what the source of unhappiness and grievance was between the sisters and Dione. One possibility was that Dione had called either Santha or Sautha a “slut” on an earlier occasion. Another possibility was that the “family” was not happy with Dinesh. They considered him as an interloper in Dione’s marriage.

7       It is also not entirely clear why the call was made. On the evening of 25 October 2016, the sisters and their families were gathered in Santha’s house to offer prayers and incense for the sisters’ late father. They usually do so on the eve of Deepavali.[^4] When the call was made by Santha, the prayers had already ended and everyone was gathered in the kitchen chatting and having food. The accused, Sautha, claims that she did not participate in the phone call; only Seetha and Santha did. According to Sautha, she was aware that Santha was speaking on the phone but did not know that it was Dione on the other line. R. Sathiyan (“Sathiyan”) and Henry Chandran s/o Balakrishnan (“Henry”), Santha’s ex-husband and Sautha’s husband respectively, say that they were not privy to the phone call at all.

8       At about 2am on 26 October 2016, the three sisters, Henry and Sathiyan arrived at Block 96 Geylang Bahru in a private hire car. Different reasons were given for going there. One reason given was that Dione’s father was going down to meet with Dinesh. There was purportedly some unhappiness that Dione was spending time on her birthday with Dinesh, instead of being at home with her children. The sisters thus wanted to resolve their issues with Dinesh and Dione with their uncle present.

9       After alighting from the private hire car, the three sisters walked ahead of Sathiyan and Henry. As they were walking, Dinesh walked past them towards Sathiyan and Henry. As Dinesh was engaged with Sathiyan and Henry in a confrontation, Dione and Santha became embroiled in a scuffle. How the scuffle started and the extent of Sautha’s and Seetha’s involvement are issues that are widely disputed. It is undisputed that no words were exchanged between the parties before the scuffle broke out.

10     The prosecution’s case is that Sautha and Santha had set upon Dione. Dione was slapped and kicked. Santha is said to have used a slingbag filled with heavy items to hit Dione. Dione fell to the ground with Santha. Each of them was pulling the other’s hair. The attacks continued whilst Dione was on the ground. Sautha and Santha also pulled up Dione’s dress, exposing her underwear. Seetha is alleged to have used her handphone to record the entire incident.

11     The defence disputes the prosecution’s narrative. The sisters claim that Dione was the aggressor. She had appeared out of nowhere and pulled Santha’s hairs and as a result, both fell to the ground. According to Sautha, everything happened so quickly. She claimed to have no physical contact with Dione at all as she was rooted to the spot, concerned that Dinesh might hurt Henry.

12     It is not disputed that Seetha called the authorities. Seetha had intended to call the police. But instead of calling the police, she called for the ambulance.

13     Dinesh broke up the scuffle when he heard Dione’s shouts. He claimed that Dione’s dress was up to her shoulders and her underwear exposed when he turned around and saw her being assaulted by the sisters. He also claimed that he was hit by the sisters. Dinesh brought Dione to the opposite block (Block 95) to seek refuge, while he returned to Block 96 to retrieve her belongings. There is a video recording of the aftermath of the incident. It shows that when Dinesh returned to Block 96, he was accosted by the three sisters, Henry and Sathiyan. Dinesh could be seen approaching Sathiyan in an aggressive and challenging manner. Both sides continued to argue; insults and vulgarities were hurled at Dinesh, mainly from Seetha and Santha.

14     Dinesh then rejoined Dione at Block 95. He claimed that she was crying throughout. He also claimed to have noticed some injuries on her.

15     The ambulance was first to the scene. This was around 2.45am. The police arrived shortly after. According to Dinesh, he brought Dione back to Block 96 when the police arrived. The ambulance record describes the case as being one of a “verbal dispute” and that no one was injured. According to Dione, she had refused to be conveyed to the hospital so that she could provide her account of what happened to the police.

16     The police spoke to both groups. According to the report of the police officers who attended at the scene, Dione was observed to have sustained some injuries. Dione told the police that she had been assaulted by the sisters. She informed the police that Seetha had recorded the incident with her handphone and asked that Seetha’s handphone be checked. However, no video recording of the incident was found.

17     After the police left the scene, Dione went to the A&E at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (“TTSH”). There, she was examined by one Dr. Gabrielle Ng (“Dr. Ng”). A battery of tests was ordered. Amongst other injuries, Dione was found to have sustained a comminuted fracture on her nose and bruises and abrasion at various parts of her body.

18     The case was investigated by one Investigating Officer Daphne Tan (“IO Daphne”). Following her investigations, Section 325 Penal Code charges were preferred against the sisters. Seetha and Santha were charged first. Sautha could not be charged at the same time as she was residing in Germany. Her husband, Henry, had been posted there for two years by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (“MFA”). They left for Germany the day after the incident. For reasons that will be canvassed below, Seetha and Santha pleaded guilty separately to reduced charges. Sautha was charged upon her return to Singapore. She has maintained her innocence throughout.

19     Against this backdrop, I now set out my findings.

## Exhibit P1: The audio recording

### The ancillary hearing to determine the admissibility of the audio recording

20     As mentioned above, the prelude to the incident was a phone call between the sisters and Dione at about 11pm on 25 October 2016. The prosecution adduced as evidence of the conversation, an audio recording which duration slightly exceeded four minutes.[^5] The audio recording appeared to be a one-way conversation. Only the voices of the three sisters were heard. Dione’s evidence was that she had muted the call.[^6] She also testified that she had previously downloaded an app on her mobile phone which automatically recorded all calls, hence the existence of this audio recording.[^7]

21     The defence objected to the admission of the audio recording as evidence, and submitted that the issue of the audio recording’s admissibility be determined at an ancillary hearing pursuant to Section 279(1) CPC.[^8] It should be highlighted that the objection was raised at a late stage of the proceedings, close to the end of the defence’s case. The audio recording had already been admitted as evidence during the prosecution’s case and no objection on admissibility had been raised then. This is also notwithstanding that the defence’s position right from the outset had been that the audio recording was tampered evidence. Defence counsel candidly explained that it was when he was looking into another issue in the case that it occurred to him that the issues concerning the audio recording fell squarely within Illustration (a) of Section 279(1) CPC. The relevant provision is reproduced as follows:-

> **Procedure to determine admissibility of evidence**

> 279(1) – Subject to this Code and any other written law relating to the admissibility of evidence, where any party objects to the admissibility of any statement made by that party or any other evidence which the other party to the case intends to tender at any stage of the trial, the court must determine it separately at an ancillary hearing before continuing with the trial.

_Illustrations_

> (_a_)     **Evidence is to be given of a tape recording that is said to be a conversation between X and Y. There is an objection that the tape has been tampered with. The court must hold an ancillary hearing to determine its admissibility.**

> \[Emphasis in bold added\]

22     The prosecution agreed that an ancillary hearing be held on account of the objection raised by the defence. This was even after I had raised some doubts as to how evidence, which had already been admitted, could be subsequently excluded should I find that it is actually inadmissible evidence.

23     An ancillary hearing was held. The consequence of the objection being raised late in the proceedings was that witnesses had to be recalled. Parties were also _ad idem_ that evidence adduced in the main proceedings could not be relied upon in the ancillary hearing although the converse holds true. This meant that the evidence of the witnesses on the issue of the admissibility of the audio recording had to be re-established through examination-in-chief and cross-examination, even though such ground had already been covered in the main proceedings.

24     The nub of the defence’s case in the ancillary is that the audio recording was tampered evidence. It was alleged that the beginning, the end and various portions in-between the actual audio recording had been edited out. Relying on the case of _Public Prosecutor v Parthiban Kanapathy_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 226</span>, the defence submitted that the test for whether tampered evidence should be admissible is that of authenticity and accuracy and in that regard, the audio recording fails on both counts.[^9] It was also submitted that the prosecution bore the burden of proving that the audio recording had not been tampered with beyond a reasonable doubt.

25     The prosecution submitted that the starting point is that all relevant evidence should be admitted. Once the relevance of the audio recording is established, its admissibility was then to be further determined in two stages. The first stage requires the court to make a finding of whether the audio recording had been tampered with and if so, the extent to which it had been tampered.[^10] The second stage involves a balancing exercise of the probative value and the prejudicial effect of the audio recording.[^11]

26     At the end of the ancillary hearing, I found that the actual audio recording was likely to have been cut off at the beginning and the end. However, it was unlikely that portions in the middle of the actual audio recording had been ‘spliced’, as the defence had alleged. Accordingly, whilst the audio recording may not have captured the entire telephone conversation between the parties, it nonetheless captured what was said during those four minutes. The persons whose voices were heard on the audio recording – Seetha, Santha and Sautha – were able to confirm the contents of the audio recording. There is no question that the audio recording contains relevant evidence. It shows the state of affairs and the relationship between the parties just prior to the incident.

27     At the close of the ancillary hearing, I allowed the audio recording to be admitted as evidence. This was primarily because I held the view that the audio recording had already been admitted as evidence and used in the examination-in-chief and cross-examination of all the witnesses who had testified prior to the commencement of the ancillary hearing. These witnesses’ evidence on the audio recording would have been enmeshed with other aspects of their evidence. It would have been impractical or difficult to disentangle and separate evidence on the audio recording from the other evidence should the audio recording be rendered inadmissible evidence. Furthermore, I had considered the defence’s objection to have been made at a late stage of the proceedings. The defence was aware of the audio recording before the commencement of the trial and had even engaged an expert to opine on whether the audio recording had been tampered with. Yet, the defence did not object to the admissibility of the audio recording when it was first adduced. To disallow the admission of the audio recording at such a late stage would, in my view, be highly prejudicial to the prosecution.

28     In accordance with the procedure laid down in Section 279(3) CPC, I invited parties to make further submissions on the admissibility of the audio recording, should they wish to do so.

29     Having considered the matter further, it would appear that Section 279 CPC should not have been invoked and relied upon in respect of the audio recording in the first place. Section 279(1) CPC contemplates the situation where a party raises an objection to the admissibility of a piece of evidence “_which the other party to the case_ _intends to tender_ _at any stage of the trial_”. A plain reading of the provision, particularly the operative words “intends to tender”, suggests that Section 279(1) CPC is only invoked where the objection is raised _before_ the piece of evidence is formally admitted. In the present case, Section 279 CPC does not apply given that the audio recording had already been admitted as evidence. This is not to say inadmissible evidence that has been wrongly admitted cannot subsequently be excluded. The court surely has a residual power in that regard and for reasons as set out above, I do not think there is any basis for excluding the audio recording as evidence. That being the case, the only issue that remains to be considered is the weight to be accorded to the audio recording.

### Evidence from the factual witnesses on the audio recording

#### Dione and Dinesh

30     The prosecution’s main witnesses, Dione and Dinesh, contradicted each other on key aspects of the audio recording. Dione’s evidence was also internally inconsistent in many aspects.

31     First, Dione claimed that when the call came in from the sisters, it was automatically recorded via an app that she had previously downloaded. She had also muted the call. Dinesh, on the other hand, testified that because the sisters were shouting and being abusive, he had told Dione to record the call to show her parents.[^12] He said that when the call first came through, the recording had not started. Dione needed to press ‘start’ to record the call.[^13] He disagreed with Dione’s evidence that the recording started automatically when the call came through.[^14]

32     Second, while Dione is adamant that she had muted her phone, there is no evidence from Dinesh that the phone was muted during the call. Dione’s evidence that the phone was muted would also be shown by the expert witnesses to be technically not possible. This will be explained below.

33     Third, Dione testified both in Seetha’s criminal proceedings and the present proceedings that neither she nor Dinesh said anything during the telephone call.[^15] She also maintained, under cross-examination, that she did not tamper or edit the audio recording and that the audio recording contains the entire telephone conversation from start to end.[^16] However, in Dione’s first statement to IO Daphne,[^17] Dione stated that the sisters had insulted her daughter at which point Dinesh “got angry and took over the phone call”. Dione was recorded to have also said in her statement that:-[^18]

> He told my cousins, if they wanted to speak to us, they should just come down and talk instead of shouting at me over the phone. He also told them that they did not have to say bad things about the children. He did not tell my cousins exactly where we were. After which, he hung up the call.

34     When confronted with this previous inconsistent statement, Dione claimed that she could not remember what she told IO Daphne and whether Dinesh had said anything to the sisters on the phone.[^19] I find that it was entirely appropriate for defence counsel to suggest, and subsequently put, to Dione that she was being “evasive” at that juncture.[^20] There was no question that Dione was relying on a faulty memory as a way out. There was no reason for her to suddenly claim that she cannot remember if Dinesh said anything during the phone call because she had, prior to being shown her first statement to IO Daphne, definitively stated that neither she nor Dinesh said anything. As highlighted above, Dione’s and Dinesh’s voices are not heard in the audio recording. Hence, if the audio recording is unedited and contains the entire telephone conversation as Dione had claimed, it would mean that the statement given by Dione to IO Daphne was false. On the flipside, if Dione’s statement to IO Daphne is true, it would then point to the logical conclusion that the audio recording had been tampered with.

35     Dione’s evidence on whether the audio recording had been edited continued to vacillate throughout the course of her testimony in court. After the defence’s expert report was shown to Dione, she conceded that the audio recording could possibly have been edited.[^21] The next day, Dione then said that if there was any editing done to the audio recording, it could have been to the end of the actual recording.[^22] However, she was sure that the audio recording as presented in Exhibit P1 was unedited. Towards the end of Dione’s cross-examination, Dione admitted that Dinesh did speak during the phone call,[^23] and that she had edited the audio recording before sending it to her mom.[^24] Shockingly, during the ancillary hearing, Dione attempted to wriggle out of her earlier evidence by claiming that she did not know how to edit audio recordings, and she could not recall if Dinesh spoke during th call or if she had edited the call at the end to remove Dinesh’s voice.[^25] However, after being confronted with her earlier admissions, Dione backtracked and agreed that her latest position in the ancillary hearing should be rejected.[^26]

36     Dione’s evidence is, in any case, contradicted by Dinesh’s evidence which is that he did speak towards the end of the conversation.[^27] Dinesh agreed that the 4-minute audio recording is incomplete.[^28] This is supported by Dinesh’s own statement to IO Daphne given on 8 November 2016, wherein he stated as follows:-

> \[3\]    After the cousins said mean things about Dione’s daughters, I took the phone and asked them why they pulled the kids into the picture when it’s an argument between adults. They started to scold you and you told them that you do not want to talk to a woman. You asked them to hand the phone over to a man in the house, but they did not. They kept shouting into the phone. I think that they were not even listening to me too. The cousins said that they would meet and talk, after which, we hung up the call.

> \[Underlined by the defence for the purpose of impeaching the witness’ credit\]

37     Dinesh agreed that the audio recording appeared to “start suddenly” without any context. He also admitted that some things were said before the recording started.[^29]

#### Santha, Seetha and Sautha

38     Sautha’s evidence is that she was not a participant in the telephone conversation and is therefore unable to comment on the contents of the audio recording.[^30]

39     Seetha testified that Dione and Dinesh spoke during the conversation which is not captured in the audio recording.[^31] Seetha could not recall if the phone was put on speaker mode. However, she firmly recalled being part of the phone call and hearing Dinesh’s and Dione’s voices.[^32] Owing to the passage of time, Seetha said that she would not be able to identify those parts of the audio recording in which Dinesh and Dione had spoken.

40     Santha was the main speaker during the telephone conversation. She insisted that Dione and Dinesh spoke during the call. She repeatedly claimed that most of what she said in the audio recording was in response to what Dione had said. Santha said that she would have “hung up the call” if she knew “they are not speaking” and that she was “not crazy enough to just … continue speaking” for four minutes.[^33] Santha attempted to identify those portions of the audio recording which she believed Dione and Dinesh to have spoken but are now missing. However, those that she identified does not correspond to the parts of the audio recording that the defence expert has alleged to be irregular.

### Evidence of the experts

#### The prosecution’s expert

41     Experts were engaged by the parties to opine on the issue of whether the audio recording had been modified.

42     The prosecution sought to rely on a report prepared by one Chong Wei Hoong (“Chong”).[^34] Chong holds the position of Head Development at the Digital and Information Forensics Centre of Expertise of the Home Team Science and Technology Agency. He is also attached to the Technology Crime Forensic Branch, Technology Crime Division of Criminal Investigation as a Principal Forensic Examiner.

43     Chong’s report focuses on addressing the defence’s allegation that the audio recording had been spliced at the following timestamps: 0:33s, 0:56s, 1:27s, 2:55s, 3:03s and 3:16s. As an aside, it is agreed between the parties that the word “splice” would refer to part of the audio recording being cut out. The impugned timestamps are characterised by a sudden silence or where human voices are inaudible. In coming up with his report, he had undertaken the task of “critical listening” of the audio file and also “analysed the waveform and spectrogram” of the audio recording.[^35] In examination-in-chief, Chong explained that the waveform plots the amplitude of the audio recording against time.[^36] It shows the volume at any given point in time in the audio recording. The spectrogram, conversely, plots the different frequencies being recorded against time.[^37] It shows the number of sources of sound at any given point in the audio recording.

44     In Chong’s opinion, there is no evidence of a clean-cut splice in the waveform or spectrogram at the alleged timestamps. Looking at the spectrogram of the audio recording, other frequencies at 100 to 200 Hertz and 7,000 Hertz could be observed even at the alleged timestamps. These extreme frequencies could be attributable to background noises. If there was a clean-cut splice, one would not observe any frequencies present at all.[^38] Similarly, from a waveform view, a wave could be observed at the alleged timestamps. This indicates that a sound was being recorded. The presence of a clean-cut splice would result in a “sudden cut off” in the wave, as opposed to the wave tapering off as can be seen at the alleged timestamps.[^39]

45     Chong proffered the following possibilities to explain the irregularities at the alleged timestamps:-

> (a)     The microphone was covered / partially covered at the speaking party end during the initial recording.

> (b)     Signal interference which may cause the microphone’s failure to pick up the human speech frequency range.

> (c)     The speaking party stopped speaking.

> (d)     The initial recorded audio file was subsequently re-recorded with another device, which interference could occur.

#### The defence’s expert

46     The defence’s expert is one Chang James Tan Swee Long (“Chang”). He is the Forensics Consultant at Infinity Forensics Pte Ltd.

47     In preparing his expert report,[^40] Chang similarly analysed the waveform and spectrogram of the audio recording with the aid of two apps / programs – Adobe Audition and Audacity. In the course of analysing the audio recording, he discovered the irregularities at the alleged timestamps which are marked by a “sudden drop in volume or sudden cut in voice”.

48     The key conclusion in Chang’s report is that there should not be a sudden silence or cut in the audio. This is because there are multiple speakers in the audio recording and it is unlikely for the sudden silence to have happened multiple times throughout the audio recording.[^41]

49     During examination-in-chief, Chang further demonstrated how the type of waveform and spectrogram observed at the alleged timestamps could be manipulated, essentially be deleting a part of the audio recording and merging the remaining parts of the audio recording.[^42] He explained this could be why the waveform and spectrogram of the audio recording do not contain silent gaps at the alleged timestamps which are obvious signatures of splicing.

50     Chang also sought, through demonstrations, to make two further points, as follows:-

> (a)     Where a recording phone is muted, there will not be any recording captured.[^43] This is because the third party application that carries out the recording makes use of the mic on the recording phone. Where the recording phone is muted, it overrides any permission given to the application.[^44]

> (b)     Where an audio file has been edited or modified, a silent gap will appear at the start of the spectrogram of that modified audio file.[^45] This does not mean that the beginning of the audio recording had been spliced. Rather, the presence of the silent gap at the beginning is a hallmark of a modified audio recording.

#### Experts’ evidence in Court

51     Both experts were put through rigorous cross-examination. There were questions raised about each expert’s credentials although I found both experts to be well-qualified and experienced in their own right. I also accept that both experts were credible witnesses whose opinions were fair, reasonable and logical. In instances where they held on to their views, they had good and objective reasons for doing so, not because they were partisan.

52     During cross-examination, Chong made a few key concessions. First, he agreed that the particular spectrogram and waveform of the audio recording at the alleged timestamps could be manipulated and obtained by deleting a part of the actual audio recording and merging what is left of the audio recording. This would eliminate the silent gap in both the waveform and spectrogram that is characteristic of splicing.[^46] As such, Chong accepted that the irregularities found at the alleged timestamps of the audio recording in the present case could have been the result of modification or editing.[^47] Second, Chong agreed that where a recording party mutes the handphone at his end, there will not be any audio recording at all.[^48] Third, Chong agreed that if an audio recording had been modified or edited, its spectrogram would display a silent gap at the beginning.[^49] As such a silent gap is found in the spectrogram of the audio recording in the present case, it is likely that the audio recording had been modified.

53     Chang, on the contrary, maintained during cross-examination that the irregularities found at the alleged timestamps were very likely results of modification, _viz._, by deleting and merging. He accepts that other possibilities cannot be ruled out although he could not think of a “logical explanation” as to why the irregularities would appear six times in a 4-minute audio recording.[^50] Chang does not consider the possibilities proffered by Chong in his report to be logical explanations for the irregularities found in the audio recording in the present case.

54     As regards the characteristic silent gap at the beginning of a modified audio recording, Chang was asked by the prosecution to load an unmodified audio recording onto a third party application such as Audacity, and subsequently export the same file without performing any modifications. When asked to look at the spectrogram of the same audio file, a similar silent gap could be observed at the beginning of the spectrogram.[^51] Chang conceded that the presence of such a silent gap at the beginning of a spectrogram is therefore independent of any modification,[^52] although he insists, without much explanation, that the chance of someone loading an audio recording onto a third party app and exporting it without any modification is very low. He explained that the creation of the silent gap at the beginning was possibly a safeguard to ensure that the entire audio recording is exported from the third party application.

55     The prosecution sought to distinguish audio recordings created by third party applications or programs, and those created by an in-built recording function or native recording function in the phone. In the latter scenario, it appeared that even when the recording phone is muted, an audio recording would still be created.[^53] When asked if the audio recording in the present case could therefore have been created by using a native recording function, Chang explained that such technology was not available in 2016. He further explained that his job requires him to keep up with technological advances. As best as he could recall, native recording functions were not available in mobile phones in 2016.[^54]

56     Chong was recalled as a witness to give his opinion on the issue of the native recording function. He explained that, in attempting to replicate the experiment on what happens when a recording party mutes the phone, he had used a Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro handphone.[^55] This was a recent model, having been released only in September 2020, and it had a native recording function. In contrast, Dione had been using a Samsung 8 Plus phone at the time of the incident which, in comparison to the Xiaomi phone, was an older phone model.

57     During further cross-examination, Chong insisted that he could not rule out if the native recording function was an existing piece of technology back in 2016.[^56] However, he conceded that he could not say that it did not exist either. Chong also conceded that he replicated the experiment with three different third party applications all of which yielded the same conclusion – that if a recording party mutes the phone, there will not be any sound captured.[^57]

### My findings

58     Based on the evidence given by the experts and the factual witnesses, I arrive at the following findings.

59     First, Dione did not mute her phone during the phone call. Dione’s evidence was that she had previously downloaded a third party recording application. She had used this application to record the phone call that night:-[^58]

> Q:    Okay. What kind of phone were you using at that time?

> A:    I think it’s Samsung 8 Plus.

> Q:    And a Samsung 8 Plus, correct me if I’m wrong, does not come with an auto record function as part of its suite of features, correct?

> A:    It doesn’t.

> Q:    So, you would have downloaded a voice recording programme on the phone.

> A:    Correct.

60     Hence, the issue of whether a native recording function was used on 25 October 2016 is moot. The conclusion reached by both experts appears to be that where a third party recording application is used and the recording party mutes the phone, there will not be any sound recorded. In the present case, since an audio recording of the phone call was obtained, the irresistible conclusion must be that Dione did not mute her phone.

61     Dione’s evidence that she muted her phone during the phone call is yet another lie. She had also stubbornly maintained this position in the face of strong and objective evidence that it would not have been technically possible for her to have muted the call and yet obtain an audio recording of the same.

62     Second, there appears to be evidence that the audio recording had been modified or edited. However, I do not find the experts’ evidence alone to be conclusive on the extent of the modifications carried out to the audio recording. It is necessary to reconcile both the experts’ and factual witnesses’ evidence in order to determine whether there had been modifications at the beginning, the middle mortions and at the end of the audio recording.

63     In my view, it appears most obvious that the end of the actual audio recording had been truncated. This is in light of Dinesh’s evidence and Dione’s eventual admissions that Dinesh spoke towards the end of the phone call.

64     I find the evidence that the audio recording had been spliced at the alleged timestamps to be equivocal. I note that various witnesses agreed that there appeared to be brief parts during the 4-minute recording where human speech was inaudible. However, in my view, the defence had made much ado of nothing of these inaudible parts. What is critical is whether the conversation flowed or was disjointed. In this regard, the defence had sought, at the eleventh hour, to call an expert in the Tamil language to opine on the flow of the conversation. According to the defence, the expert would testify that it is unlikely that people conversant in Tamil would speak in such a manner as is heard in the audio recording, and that the contents of the audio recording do not flow.[^59] I had rejected the defence’s application. I was of the view that this was a factual issue rather than one that called for an expert’s opinion. Furthermore, the participants of the telephone conversation are witnesses in the proceedings. They would be able to testify as to whether the conversation in the 4-minute audio recording flowed. They would also be able to provide the best evidence on the issue itself. I thus considered it unnecessary for an expert in the Tamil language to be called.

65     During cross-examination, Santha, the main speaker in the audio recording, was asked to pick out the parts which she believed Dione and Dinesh to have spoken but had been cut out. The parts which she identified did not correspond with the alleged timestamps wherein irregularities were found by the defence’s expert.[^60] The defence relied heavily on the irregularity at 1m 27s of the audio recording wherein Santha could be heard saying as follows:-

> \[in Tamil\] Ryan is not a (inaudible). You told me right? Christian… (inaudible) Oh Jesus (inaudible). The Indian goddess \[Mariatha\] will make you run on the streets naked. You will then know the status of the people. The daughter of a prostitute is still on the line.

66     The defence contends that the references to ‘Jesus’ and ‘Mariatha’ are incongruous because one deity belongs to Christianity and the other, Hinduism. I note that Dinesh also found this to be odd. However, I find the defence’s contention overplayed. After all, looking at the context in which the references were made, Santha appeared to have been on the topic of religion. Hence, I do not consider the references to ‘Jesus’ and ‘Mariatha’ to be as incongruous as the defence made it out to be. Apart from this particular example, it is also my finding that the defence has failed to properly articulate in what manner the conversation is disjointed in respect of the other timestamps wherein the other irregularities were found.

67     I also find Santha to be an unreliable witness, as I will explain later in this judgment.

68     The prosecution pointed out that during the 4-minute audio recording, there were four instances in which Santha appeared to question if Dione and Dinesh were still on the line, as follows:-

>   
| 

\[00:11 – 00.17\]

 |
| 

Santha:

 | 

Dina called her own mother bitch. Oh my god, is she on the line?

 |
| 

\[2:24 – 2:27\]

 |
| 

Santha:

 | 

She is listening lah. Is there anything else?

 |
| 

\[\[3:06 – 3:12\]

 |
| 

Santha:

 | 

She is. She is listening. She put in the mute. Either she be recce recce, recording. Ah, ah.

 |
| 

\[3:34 – 3:36\]

 |
| 

Santha:

 | 

She doesn’t want to talk?

 |

  
  

69     I considered the comments made by Santha in the audio recording to be of significance. In my view, it very clearly shows that Dinesh and Dione had not been speaking, thereby prompting questions at the sisters’ end as to whether Dinesh and Dione were still on the line. Furthermore, given that the purpose of turning on the recording was to show the ugly side of the sisters, it made sense that Dinesh and Dione would keep quiet and allow the sisters to continue the shouting and the verbal abuse. They were, after all, baiting the sisters to continue their rant whilst they recorded. As the defence submitted, the audio recording was meant to be “_a one-way expression of anger by the 3 sisters, that \[Dione\] and Dinesh merely kept silent, and did nothing to aggravate the situation_”.[^61] In light thereof, it is my finding that the 4-minute audio recording contains the entire conversation that took place in that 4-minute duration. There was no splicing done to the audio recording in its current form.

70     It is likely that there was conversation that preceded the 4-minute audio recording. First, the audio recording starts off abruptly with Santha saying “oh, Dina got boyfriend ah?” Second, it is odd that just some 11 seconds into the recording, Santha would ask if Dione is “on the line”. Third, Dinesh’s evidence is that he had told Dione to start recording because Santha and Seetha were shouting and being abusive. This suggests that the conversation had gone on for some time _before_ the recording started. Fourth, Dinesh admitted during the ancillary hearing that “some other things” were said before the recording started.

71     However, having further considered the evidence and parties’ submissions, I find that the defence has not met its evidential burden in showing that the beginning of the audio recording had been truncated. In my view, the earlier part of the conversation is not captured in the audio recording simply because Dione had only turned on the recording function later, after Dinesh had told her to do so.

72     Dinesh and Dione maintain that Dione did not speak throughout the phone call. Seetha and Santha are adamant that they heard Dione speak. I find it highly unlikely that Dione would not have said anything at all. The call was made to her phone. The evidence suggests there was only call. It is unlikely that Dinesh would have been the one who had picked up the call and speak to the sisters. It is also more likely than not that there was some exchange between both sides before the call descended into a one-side tirade.

73     The defence alleges that Dione had modified the audio recording to deceive and mislead for the purpose of these criminal proceedings. There is no evidence that this was so. The evidence, which the defence appears to accept, is that Dione had edited the audio recording to remove Dinesh’s voice as she wanted to send the audio recording to her mother. According to Dinesh, Dione’s mother did not have a good impression of him. Because Dione was also still married to Ryan at that time, she did not want her mother to hear Dinesh’s voice.

74     While I do not think that the act of modifying the original recording may not have been done in bad faith, I am troubled by the fact that Dione sent the edited audio recording to IO Daphne rather than the unedited one. There is no question that in sending the audio recording to IO Daphne, Dione knew that this recording would be used for the purposes of the present case. It is questionable if she had intended to mislead IO Daphne given that she had provided a statement stating that Dinesh spoke at the end of the phone call. However, seeing how Dione had prevaricated on this issue in the course of these proceedings, I can only surmise that Dione eventually wanted to create the impression that the phone call was one-sided and unprovoked.

75     I accept the prosecution’s contention that the audio recording shows the sisters harassing Dione. This is because the sisters continued insulting and abusing Dione even though she and Dinesh had kept quiet during the four minutes. It also clearly shows that there was animus between the sisters and Dione.

76     However, in my view, that is as far as the audio recording goes. The audio recording is an incomplete and unreliable record of the conversation between the parties. Dinesh admitted that he spoke towards the end of the telephone conversation. In Dinesh’s police statement,[^62] he stated that the sisters said they would “_meet and talk_”. In Dione’s police statement, she had stated that Dinesh told the sisters that if they wanted to speak, they “_could just come down and talk instead of shouting at me over the phone_”.[^63] These statements well change the complexion of the conversation that transpired between the parties. For one, the conversation was not a one-way call. Dione’s and Dinesh’s police statements also throw doubt on a pre-arranged common design to commit a criminal act to cause grievous hurt to Dione as they suggest that the purpose of the sisters going down to meet Dione and Dinesh was just to “meet and talk”. Dione’s statement also suggests that Dinesh may have invited or challenged the sisters to meet him and talk. The long and short is that the conversation may not be an unprovoked one as the prosecution makes it out to be. As the entire context of the conversation is missing, I agree with the defence that little weight should be accorded to the audio recording.

## Inherent problems and material inconsistencies in Dione’s evidence

77     I turn now to consider Dione’s evidence in relation to the incident on 26 October 2016. In my view, her evidence is inconsistent internally. It is also contradicted by Dinesh’s evidence. Dione would repeatedly claim that many matters are no longer within her recollection. However, I find her to be an evasive and untruthful witness. The problems with Dione’s evidence are catalogued below.

### Dione did not actually see or witness what each of the sisters did to her

78     Dione testified that during the scuffle, her eyes were shut and she was covering her face with her hands because she had a photoshoot a few days later and she did not want her face to be affected in any way. She said Santha was on her left, Sautha on her right and Seetha was in front of her taking photos. She was very certain that she saw Seetha taking a video of all that was happening.[^64] Dione says that when she was curled up on the ground, she “felt” kicks to both sides of her body. She is unable to say how many times she was kicked.[^65]

79     Dione admitted that she was covering her eyes and her vision was blocked.[^66] She tried to clarify that she did not cover her eyes throughout the entire ordeal.[^67] However, she conceded that she could not testify to what the sisters were actually doing around her.[^68] She ‘felt’ kicks to her body but she did not see who kicked her. She assumed Santha and Sautha kicked her only because she recalled they were by her sides. Dione confirmed she did not see Sautha kick her.[^69] In the same vein, Dione is unable to say for sure who pulled up her dress,[^70] but assumes that Santha and Sautha were the culprits.

80     In this regard, there is doubt as to whether Dione had, in fact, been kicked and had her dress pulled up. Even if this doubt can be dispelled, a further doubt arises as to the identities of the person or persons who had kicked her and pulled up her dress. Dione had described the incident as “messy” and that things were happening very quickly.[^71] Taking into account her evidence that she was curled up on the ground with her hands covering her eyes and with blows allegedly raining on her face and body at the same time,[^72] I find it doubtful that Dione would be able to make out, with such certainty, the relative positions of the sisters and what each had done to her.

### Dione claimed that she was dragged on the ground

81     Dione was asked during cross-examination if she had been dragged by her hair along the road.[^73] Dione categorically answered this in the negative.

82     This turned out to be inconsistent with the statements that she had given contemporaneously to the police officer who attended at the scene and the attending doctor at TTSH.

83     In Dr. Ng’s medical report,[^74] Dr. Ng recorded that “_she said she was assaulted by 3 women at 2:40am and she was dragged by the hair along the wet road_”. When confronted with this evidence, Dione claimed that she could not recall mentioning this to Dr. Ng.[^75] Dione, however, maintained that she had not been dragged on the road by the sisters although in the same breath, she also claimed that she was in a state of trauma at the material time and given the passage of time, cannot remember about being dragged.[^76]

84     In the NP306, a form which was filled up by the police officer who attended at the scene for the purpose of allowing Dione to seek medical attention, it is recorded that Dione’s hair was pulled and she was “_dragged on the ground_”.[^77] This allegation is repeated in the Emergency Department Case Record and also the Request for Radiological Investigation.[^78]

85     After these statements were shown to Dione, Dione claimed that the statements given to the police officer who attended at the scene and the various persons at TTSH “_has \[sic\] to be true because those are fresh_”. However, she is now unable to remember being dragged on the ground or making those statements.[^79]

86     Dione had changed her evidence on the stand on this issue when confronted with the contemporaneous documents. I find that Dione lied in the various statements about being dragged by her hair on the road. It is Dione’s own evidence that she and Santha were on the ground pulling hard at each other’s hair. It would therefore not have been possible or likely for Dione to have been dragged by her hair on the wet road.

### Whether Dione retaliated

87     Dione’s evidence is that she reached up to grab Santha’s hair to stop her from kicking or swinging the bag at her.[^80] According to Dione, she said she held on to Santha’s hair,[^81] “grabbed with all her might” and twisted it.[^82] Dione was certain Santha would have felt pain.[^83]

88     However, during the investigations, IO Daphne specifically asked Dione if she had retaliated. Dione’s response was that she “_did not have a chance to \[as the\] three of them were against me and the whole time, I was trying to cover my face_”.[^84]

89     This inconsistency is stark. Dione confirmed during cross-examination that she understood what “retaliate” meant.[^85] She also agreed that pulling Santha’s hair was an act of retaliation. When confronted with this inconsistency, Dione admitted that she lied in her statement to IO Daphne.[^86] I agree with the defence that Dione must have omitted mentioning this to IO Daphne to create the impression that she was outnumbered, helpless and vulnerable.

### Doubt as to how Dione could have pulled Santha’s hair whilst curled up on the ground

90     Dione’s evidence is that she was curled up on the ground shielding her face as she had a photoshoot to attend the next day. She agreed with defence counsel’s description that she was curled up on the ground like a “_cooked shrimp_”.[^87] That being the case, I find it questionable as to how Dione could have reached up to pull Santha’s hair. Dione claimed during cross-examination that she managed to pull Santha’s hair because Santha was bending down.[^88] However, I note that the prosecution had asked Dione the same question during examination-in-chief and she was unable to explain how she did it.[^89] In any event, even if Santha was bending down, I find it quite unbelievable that Dione would be able to reach Santha’s hair whilst she was curled up on the ground protecting herself from being kicked and hit by Santha’s bag.

### Doubt as to how Santha could hold her bag, pull Dione’s hair and try to pull up Dione’s dress all at the same time

91     Dione’s evidence was that she had pulled Santha’s hair to stop her from hitting or kicking her. After Dione had pulled Santha’s hair, Santha stopped hitting Dione with the bag and started pulling Dione’s hair as well.[^90] Later in the course of cross-examination, Dione said that she pulled Santha’s hair “_after because she was pulling onto my hair_”[^91] although she reverted to the earlier version when she was asked to explain the inconsistency.

92     Things get more confusing. Dione later testified that Santha continued hitting her whilst they were pulling each other’s hair.[^92] Dione also gave evidence that Santha and Sautha tried to pull up her dress to make her let go of Santha’s hair. I find Dione’s account difficult to believe. If Santha was on the ground pulling Dione’s hair and hitting her, it would not be possible for her to be pulling up Dione’s dress as well.

93     I note also that Dione had been evasive about the issue of whether Santha fell on the ground. Throughout her cross-examination, she maintained that she could not remember if Santha fell to the ground with her. However, if Dione could purportedly be able to recall where each sister was relative to her and what each of them were doing, there is no reason why she would not be able to recall if she and Santha had been pulling each other’s hair on ther ground. At the end of Dione’s testimony, she finally conceded that she had pulled Santha’s hair which resulted in Santha being “_pulled to the ground_”.[^93]

### Dione alleged that the accused had slapped her

94     During cross-examination, Dione claimed that Sautha held her hands and also slapped her.[^94] She maintained that Dione slapped her when defence counsel asked her if she was sure that was the case, as Dione did not mention Sautha slapping her during examination-in-chief.

95     Subsequently, defence counsel took Dione through her evidence given in Seetha’s criminal proceedings wherein Dione also never mentioned that Sautha had slapped her.[^95] It was at that point Dione then conceded that Sautha never slapped her.[^96] When asked why she had accused Sautha of slapping her initially, Dione claimed that she “_accidentally said slap instead of kick_”.[^97] I find Dione’s explanation quite unbelievable considering that a slap and a kick are very different types of actions.

96     Even if I accept that Dione had made a genuine mistake when first asked, defence counsel had asked her a second time if she was sure that was the case to which she confirmed emphatically. When asked if she was sure, it would have only been natural that this should have given Dione some pause to rethink if there was something wrong with her answer. However, she confirmed that Sautha did slap her. It was only after Dione’s evidence in Seetha’s criminal proceedings was read to her that she then denounced her earlier allegation that Sautha slapped her.

97     As the defence also pointed out, the accused stated in her police statement[^98] that “_Sautha used her right hand to slap me on my left cheek_”. I agree with the defence that the allegation was made with a high degree of specificity. If this allegation is true, I would expect Dione to be consistent in repeating this allegation in her recounting of the incident. On the stand, when Dione said that Sautha slapped her, that could not have been an “accident” as she had claimed. Rather, it was a case of Dione was getting tripped up and confused by the different versions of events that she had given over the years. Upon further cross-examination, Dione admitted that what she stated in her police statement is untrue.[^99]

### Dione claimed that she fell to the ground because she was in heels

98     In the criminal proceedings against Seetha, Dione testified that she fell to the ground because she was wearing heels. The relevant excerpt from the notes of evidence is as follows:-[^100]

> Q:    Okay, so, now let me take you back to the alleged assault, you said that ‘Santha’ – s—started to slap you? And at the same time ‘Sautha’ was trying to hold on to your hands?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    Okay, then tell the Court, what happened after that?

> A:     **As I was wearing heels, I actually fell off to the ground**, I curled myself and started covering my face, because they started to kick me and ‘Santha’ had this black drawstring pouch, which contained hard objects like batteries. And she started banging it on my face.

> \[Emphasis in bold added\]

99     In the present proceedings, Dione maintained that she fell because she was wearing heels.[^101] However, based on Exhibit P2.2 which was a video recording taken by Seetha immediately after the scuffle, Dinesh can be seen picking up a pair of shoes from the table at which he was drinking with Dione. When shown the video recording, Dinesh was unequivocal that he picked up Dione’s heels.[^102] In cross-examination, Dinesh testified that whilst he and Dione were drinking, Dione had taken off her shoes which had “_very high heels … because her leg was very painful_” and that she had been barefooted when the scuffle occurred and when he brought her over to Block 95.[^103]

### Dione’s claim that she was bleeding from her nose

100    As regard Dione’s alleged injures, Dione testified in these proceedings that she found dried blood in her nose when she saw the doctor at the hospital. She said that after the scuffle, “_there was blood coming out of my nose_”.[^104] However, she could not recall if she had bled from one or both nostrils and whether she had used a tissue paper or something to stem the flow of the blood. When Dione was again cross-examined on this issue in a later tranche of the proceedings (a few weeks later), Dione said that she could not remember if there had been blood flowing out of her nose.[^105] She also could not remember if and how the doctor treated the dried blood in her nose.

101    Dinesh testified that he saw a swell on Dione’s nose and the bleeding although he could not tell if the blood was from inside or outside her nose.[^106] When probed, Dinesh said that he cannot recall if Dione’s nose was bleeding or not.[^107] In Dinesh’s first statement given to IO Daphne, he stated that Dione’s nose was bleeding quite badly.[^108] Dinesh affirmed the contents of his first statement in his second statement given to IO Daphne on 28 September 2017. Despite being presented with his earlier statements, Dinesh could not recollect if Dione’s nose had been bleeding.[^109] I found this odd. If Dione’s nose had been bleeding badly, this would surely be something that would be imprinted in Dinesh’s memory and the statement should have jogged his memory.

102    I can only surmise that the claim that Dione’s nose was bleeding badly was an embellishment by both Dinesh and Dione. I find support for drawing this conclusion from the fact that Dr. Ng did not report any observation of blood. When she took the stand, she agreed that if she had found blood when examining Dione, she would have included this in her report. Further, neither the paramedics nor the police who arrived at the scene noted that Dione was bleeding. The paramedics testified that they would have treated Dione if they have noticed any bleeding. If Dione was indeed bleeding badly, as she had claimed, one would have expected to find bloodstains on her dress or even on Santha, as they had been in a scuffle. There is no evidence of this.

### The effect of alcohol on Dione’s judgment, powers of observation and temperament

103    Dione and Dinesh were drinking on the night of 25 October 2016. It was later revealed at the tail-end of the trial that both Dione and Dinesh were given a police warning for drinking in public during prohibited hours. Dinesh testified that they drank “_hard liquor_” that night. At the end of the day, it is unclear how much Dione and Dinesh drank that night and how inebriated, if at all, they had become. Dione testified that she was unaffected by the drinks and there is no evidence for me to find otherwise.

104    However, even if Dione and Dinesh may not have been intoxicated to the point of losing consciousness, I would have thought it critical to question if the alcohol could possibly have affected or impaired their judgment, powers of observation and temperament that night. IO Daphne agreed during cross-examination that this would have provided some useful insight into Dione’s state of mind at that time.[^110] And not only that. The consumption of alcohol could have impaired their perception and recollection of events subsequently. IO Daphne conceded that she did not think to question Dione about how much she drank because she formed the impression that Dione did not drink to the “_point where she was unable to function properly_”.[^111] This obviously made no sense. I find that there was no basis for IO Daphne to make such an assumption since she was not present at the scene and she did not even question Dione and Dinesh about how much alcohol they consumed that night.[^112] I will further consider IO Daphne’s role and thoroughness in the investigations of this case below.

### Criminal proceedings against Seetha and the Starhub bill

#### Seetha’s conviction

105    By way of background, Seetha was originally charged with the same offence as the accused in the present case. Seetha contested the charge and the trial commenced on 28 June 2018 before another District Judge.[^113] It should be highlighted that by the time of Seetha’s trial, Santha had already pleaded guilty to a charge brought under Section 323 read with Section 34 of the Penal Code. On 11 January 2019, Santha was convicted accordingly and sentenced to imprisonment for five months.[^114]

106    Dione took the stand in Seetha’s trial as the prosecution’s first witness. On the second day of trial, Dione testified that Seetha made no physical contact with her during the alleged scuffle. Dione also testified that Seetha’s role in the incident was only that she had recorded a video of the assault and whilst Santha and Sautha had pulled up her dress.[^115] The trial was adjourned to a second tranche of dates. During the interim, further representations were made by the defence on the basis of the evidence given by Dione in court. The prosecution responded to the representations by agreeing to lower the charge to one brought under Section 3(1)(a) read with Section 3(2) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap. 256A, Rev. Ed. 2015) instead. Seetha pleaded guilty to the reduced charge and was fined S$5,000, in stark contrast to the punishment that Santha received.

#### The Starhub bill issue

107    The Starhub bill issue, whilst appearing to be a peripheral issue, raises some serious doubts as to Dione’s credibility and the integrity of allegations raised against Dione and her sisters, notwithstanding the fact that Santha and Seetha had already been convicted and sentenced in respect of the incident.

108    Essentially, sometime in 2018, Seetha signed up for a number of phone lines with Starhub. Seetha testified during examination-in-chief that some of the Starhub phone lines were obtained for Dione and her sisters, Bernice and Lynn.[^116] Dione claimed that the phone line was not used by her but her daughter, Dina. By 2019, Seetha faced a mounting Starhub bill and the threat of legal action for the unpaid dues. She sought contribution from Dione and her sisters, to pay for what the phone lines they had used. Dione refused, on the basis that she had “helped” Seetha in respect of the criminal proceedings brought against Seetha for her involvement in the incident on 26 October 2016. Starhub eventually commenced legal proceedings against Seetha for unpaid bills in excess of S$11,000. Starhub obtained a default judgment against Seetha on 12 June 2019.[^117]

109    Returning to the present proceedings, the defence confronted Dione on a series of Whatsapp chats which suggest that Dione, being the alleged victim and key witness, had tailored her evidence in the criminal proceedings against Seetha. The following are some of the exchanges between Dione and her sisters on 11 November 2019.[^118] This was in the context of Dione and her sisters discussing how to respond to Seetha’s daughter, Gomathi, who was seeking paymnt from the sisters in a separate Whatsapp groupchat:-

Hi Gom. This was a verbal agreement between myself and your mum with Paal. I don’t know why I am keep quiet but this is getting out of hand. Yes we can pay what we owe but the agreement is that there would not be any monetary agreements or any communication between her and us after helping her with her case.

 |
| 

 | 

My eldest sister spoke to her and asked to aid us to speak to Starhub or speak to the MP way before this had become a lawyer’s case. **If I can help someone when it came to my case, why can’t your mother help us speak to the lawyers or the MP or even Starhub to reduce the amounts for my sisters at least?** How did it become our faults that it went to the lawyers when my sister told beforehand speak to Starhub. I’m not gonna pay because I and your mom have an agreement not to have any money issues between us. She is definitely going to ignore now. **But like I said, if I can help with a major case of mine then I don’t see why your mum can’t**. So let me know what’s the update after this.

**Your mother’s case verdict was only last year and the only reason why it was merely a fine is because I helped write in to make sure nothing happens to her. And the same help I am also asking for your mother to extend**. Like I said it was a verbal agreement. If you want the black and white then fine, get starhub or the lawyers to split the accounts and my sisters and I will pay on our own accord through the means that we are able to. Or I’ll bring this up to my DO and see if I’m supposed to even be paying this. Until my case has ended I am not supposed to have any contact with your mum. I still kept quiet. I still paid. But how long more am I supposed to be keeping quiet when we are always even getting reminders. If you wanna talk about law, Gom. My eldest is also with the law for borrowing tons of cash for your mum to pay off so much of debts til now no money is asked from her. The only reason I didn’t bring this up is because we wanted none of this to come up to you. And now this is going on, let me know if your mum can speak to the lawyers or not if not I myself will head over to small claims and see what can be done.

110    The messages which Bernice crafted for Dione were subsequently sent wholesale by Dione to Seetha’s daughter.[^119]

111    Dione repeatedly tried to distance herself from the Starhub bill issue by denying its relevance to the present proceedings.[^120] However, I found the Starhub bill issue to be highly relevant to the proceedings. The allegation that Dione changed her evidence to help Seetha in her criminal proceedings, if true, would directly impinge on the issue of her credibility and would cast doubt on the allegations now being raised against Sautha. Furthermore, if the Starhub bill issue was not relevant to the proceedings, there would have been no reason for Dione to be concerned about screenshots of her messages and call records “_go\[ing\] out wrongly_” in light of the fact that Sautha’s case was still pending.[^121] Little did Dione realise that her concerns would indeed come to pass with copies of the messages falling into the defence’s hands and being relied upon in these proceedings.

#### Relationship between Dione and Dinesh on the one hand, and Seetha on the other

112    Dione testified that she disliked Seetha, Sautha and Santha for what they had done to her in 2016.[^122] There was not interaction between Dione and the sisters after the incident and Dione would keep away from them at family functions.[^123] As regards Seetha, Dione claimed that they started speaking sometime in 2017 or 2018 because their children were close to each other. Even then, their interactions were limited to simple greetings and Dione would continue to keep a distance from Seetha.[^124] Dione testified that whilst Seetha’s case was still pending, the police had cautioned her not to have any contact with Seetha.[^125]

113    Dinesh also testified that he was not close to Seetha. He claimed that “_from \[sic\] day one, I don’t like her_”.[^126] He explained that he would attend functions and gatherings where Seetha was also present only because Dione was there too.

114    Seetha, however, appeared to have a completely different perception of her relationship with Dione and Paal. Seetha described her relationship with Dinesh as “close” and “genuine”.[^127] As regards Dione, Seetha said that until the Starhub bill issue arose, they had always enjoyed a close relationship even after the incident in 2016.[^128]

115    The defence adduced as Exhibit D2 a set of photographs taken from Dione’s Facebook page. These photographs were taken in the years subsequent to the incident on 26 October 2016. The photographs portrayed a relationship closer to what Seetha had described. The photographs showed Seetha and Dione attending many parties and gatherings together. Dione had invited Seetha to her house for a family gathering on 15 September 2018. This was mid-way through Seetha’s trial. There were numerous photographs of Seetha and Dione with arms around each other, both in smiles. Some of these photographs were even captioned with, in social-media lingo, smileys, emoticons and love-filled comments. Take for example, Seetha posted a “Happy Birthday” message on Dione’s Facebook page on the second anniversary of the incident accompanied with photographs on both of them. Dione replied with the message “Thank you KAAA with love” with a kiss emoticon.[^129] In another set of photographs taken at Seetha’s birthday party, Dione and Dinesh can each be seen feeding Seetha, again everyone in smiles.

116    Dione attempted the justify the photographs in various ways. When asked in cross-examination why she would tag Seetha in the photographs, she first testified that Seetha had been auto-tagged. She subsequently claimed that Seetha had been tagged in the photos accidentally.[^130] Certainly, neither explanation was true considering that some of the photographs were accompanied by comments and exchanges between Seetha and Dione. When further questioned, Dione would then conveniently claim that she could not remember why or how Seetha had been tagged.[^131]

117    In my view, the photographs in Exhibit D2 betray the manner in which Dione and Dinesh had described their relationship and interactions with Seetha. Clearly, Dione’s interactions with Seetha went beyond mere pleasantries. Under pressure during cross-examination, Dione was forced to backtrack and she tried to explain her relationship with Seetha as follows:-[^132]

\[Dione\]

 | 

Your Honour, can I just say something?

 |
| 

\[Court\]

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

\[Dione\]

 | 

Deep down, Seetha Letchumi is, uh, elder sister to me from young. So, in our family itself, we do not have like my sister is just my sister, Seetha used to be my eldest sister as well. **So, this incident of they, um, assaulting me, right, changed the whole thing but deep down, she’s still my elder sister. In that way I still respect her.** When my elder sister actually did her birthday, I actually went to work. But the fact that she assaulted me is still there back in my – back in my head **but in terms of family itself, we still have our own values going around that we are still family** but “You still need to get what you did to me.” That is my mindset itself. So, with the way that, um, he is actually going. He—he—he seems to be like pushing it to me that I deliberately or I don’t know how to put it actually.

\[Emphasis in bold added\]

118    As regards Dinesh, I do not believe that he is a person who would keep up pretences. Dinesh referred to the incident which led him to totally stopped talking to Seetha. He said that Dione and her sister, Lynn, once lied about going to a club. He blamed Seetha for bringing Dione and Lynn to the club. Since then, he totally stopped interacting with Seetha.[^133] I could not see how this lying incident could be worse than what allegedly took place in the wee hours on 26 October 2016. If the lying incident could have resulted in Dinesh giving Seetha a cold shoulder, I would have imagined that the alleged assault and outraged of modesty on his girlfriend in 2016 would have filled him with hatred towards the sisters. Yet, the photographs showed Dinesh to be enjoying himself in Seetha’s company.

#### My findings

119    The Starhub bill issue was first raised during the cross-examination of Dione on 4 January 2021.[^134] Dione denied that she had asked Seetha to pay for the Starhub bill because she had helped Seetha during the latter’s criminal proceedings. On all other matters pertaining to the Starhub bill, Dione would either cite a faulty memory or disclaim knowledge of the same. This was a tactic that pervaded Dione’s cross-examination. When asked if she had exchanged Whatsapp messages with Seetha’s daughter, Gomathi, on the Starhub bill, Dione claimed that she could not remember. This turned out to be a complete lie after the defence had doggedly traced and sought to adduce as evidence a trove of messages on this very topic.[^135]

120    During cross-examination the next day on 5 January 2021, defence counsel asked Dione if she had discussed her evidence given in Court with anyone to which Dione resolutely denied.[^136] Dione’s responses, yet again, turned out to be lies. After various call logs and Whatsapp messages between Dione and her sisters were produced and shown to Dione, Dione was forced to recant.[^137] An excerpt of the Whatsapp exchange between Dione and her sisters in a Whatsapp groupchat entitled “Keepsy & Tipsy” on 4 January 2021 between 13.56 and 14.35, just before the afternoon court session, shows that they had specifically discussed matters pertaining to the case. The relevant excerpt is reproduced below:-

121    The conversation between Dione and her sisters on the Court proceedings continued after the afternoon Court session on 4 January 2021 (at 14.03 to 14.07) as evidenced by the following exchange on Whatsapp:-

122    One of the messages also showed that Dione’s sister, Bernice, had called Seetha’s daughter during the lunch break on 4 January 2021 to ask if she was the one who “_shared the message_” on the Starhub bill issue with the defence.[^138]

123    Several issues arise here. First, Dione had discussed her evidence with her sisters despite me warning her in clear terms not to discuss the case with anyone. Dione explained that she had thought close family members were an exception but I find this to be rather disingenuous and that she should have known better. Second, it was clear that Dione was getting coached by her sisters on how to respond to the questions raised by defence counsel. In my view, Dione’s conduct in this regard was inappropriate and reproachable. Not only did she have little regard for Court orders. She had also been caught lying. This severely undermines her credibility.

124    However, it was Dione’s reaction to being confronted with the Starhub bill issue that gave me pause. Dione assumed that Seetha had provided the defence with copies of the messages on the Starhub bill and labelled her as being ‘ungrateful’ for doing so in spite of the help that Dione rendered to her. After some lengthy cross-examination, Dione eventually conceded that she had called Seetha ‘ungrateful’ in the messages because she considered that she had ‘helped’ Seetha in her criminal proceedings, yet Seetha had surfaced the Starhub bill issue to the defence in the present case.[^139]

125    The critical issue comes down to how Dione had ‘helped’ Seetha in the criminal proceedings. Dione claimed that her version of ‘helping’ Seetha was by not pursuing the matter further after she (i.e., Seetha) had been sentenced to a fine of S$5,000.[^140] Dione’s evidence was that Dinesh was upset about the incident and felt that Seetha got off too lightly with just a fine. Dione, however, persuaded Dinesh to let the matter rest and not pursue the matter further. Dione testified that if she truly wanted to help Seetha, she would have said that Seetha did not commit any wrongdoing at all.

126    I found Dione’s explanation to be neither likely nor convincing for the following reasons.

127    First, Seetha testified that the day before her criminal trial commenced, Dione told Seetha that she and Dinesh would help her.[^141] According to Seetha, Dione considered that Seetha had children and if she were to be convicted, she would likely be imprisoned, just as Santha was. Dione would therefore change her evidence as regards Seetha’s role in the incident.[^142] When asked why Dione would help her, Seetha explained that their families were “_so close that you wouldn’t do this to another cousin … that’s what she help \[sic\] me for_”.[^143] Seetha testified that she asked Dione how she would render help to which Dione said that she would “_change the hitting part_” and “_talk to Daphne and make things up_”. I note that in cross-examination, Seetha was barely contradicted on her evidence on this issue.

128    Dione and Dinesh have disavowed their closeness with Seetha. Whilst that may be the case after the Starhub bill issue arose, the evidence suggests that around the time of Seetha’s criminal proceedings, Dione and Dinesh were actually quite close to her. The photographs in Exhibit D2 that were obtained from Dione’s Facebook profile page showed that both cousins had gone out clubbing and partying on a regular basis, right up to the date of Seetha’s eventual conviction. In respect of some of the photos that were posted, Dione would include captions that portray a closeness and fondness between the two cousins. Dinesh is no exception. He was present in many of the photos, basking in Seetha’s company. I have no doubt that Dione and Dinesh had lied about their relationship with Seetha during this period. They were close to Seetha and it would explain why they decided to help her in the criminal proceedings.

129    I also find it highly improper that Dione and Seetha were fraternising and having a merry good time whilst Seetha’s criminal proceedings were ongoing. I accept that Dione and Seetha are cousins. However, they were also the alleged aggressor and victim in a criminal case, the key witnesses albeit one for the prosecution and the other for the defence. Dione had even been cautioned by the police not to have any contact with Seetha. I find it extremely difficult to imagine how Dione could stand in the witness box as Seetha’s accuser of a serious crime whilst enjoying such a close relationship with Seetha. Although hackneyed, it is axiomatic that “justice must not only be done, but also be seen to be done”. And this has to be viewed not only in the context of Seetha’s criminal proceedings, but in Santha’s conviction and the present proceedings faced by Sautha both of whom were originally named as Seetha’s co-accused persons. If Dione perjured herself during Seetha’s criminal proceedings to help Seetha get a lighter punishment, it throws doubt into the sanctity of Santha’s earlier conviction. It also casts serious doubt on Dione’s credibility in these proceedings and also on her integrity as the prosecution’s key witness.

130    Second, Dione’s explanation does not accord with what she had stated in her messages. It is clear from the messages that Dione considered that she had ‘helped’ Seetha get a fine instead of an imprisonment term. There was no other way in which Dione could have helped Seetha other than to tailor her evidence accordingly which resulted in the prosecution preferring a reduced charge against Seetha. She knew that Santha received an imprisonment term for allegedly physically assaulting her and she knew or must have known that there would have been a difference for Seetha if she testified that Seetha did not physically assault her.[^144]

131    Furthermore, the only reason why Dione labelled Seetha as “ungrateful” must have been because Seetha _knew_ and was _aware_ of how Dione had helped her. In this regard, from the evidence, Seetha only knew that Dione had helped her by falsely testifying about Seetha’s role in the incident. There is no evidence that Seetha was aware that Dione had tried to stop Dinesh from pursuing the matter, as Dione had baselessly allegedly.

132    Third, Dinesh’s evidence contradicts Dione’s testimony. During cross-examination, Dinesh agreed that he was unhappy with the sentence Seetha received for her involvement in the incident. His unhappiness, however, appeared to stem from his belief that Seetha had physically assaulted Dione, as well as outraged her modesty by pulling her dress up. He claimed that he did not know Dione had testified during Seetha’s trial that Seetha did not physically assault her (i.e., Dione). According to Dinesh, it is in these proceedings that he is hearing this revelation the first time.[^145]

133    Dinesh testified that he wanted to pursue the matter and sought advice from some of his friends on the options available to him. After learning there was nothing he could do after the sentence had been passed, Dinesh decided to leave the matter be.[^146] In order to give Dione a lifeline, Dinesh said that he never shared this with Dione and that Dione continues to labour under the impression that Dinesh still intends to pursue the matter.[^147] However, crucially, Dinesh denies that he had any discussion with Dione about not pursuing the matter.[^148] Furthermore, as far as Dinesh was concerned, there was nothing he could do about the sentence Seetha received. It thus cannot be said that Dinesh’s inaction had helped Seetha in any way.

134    Fourth, it is established that prior to Seetha’s trial, Dione had taken the position that all three sisters had physically assaulted her. This is what she told the police who attended at the scene, Dr Gabriella Ng who examined her at the A&E department at TTSH on 26 October 2016, and IO Daphne in her two statements recorded on 8 November 2016 and 28 September 2017.[^149] However, she changed her tune during Seetha’s trial in June 2018. Dione’s explanation was that, before Seetha’s trial, she tried to recollect what exactly happened during the incident. It was then that it dawned on her that Seetha did not physically assault her but only recorded the incident with her mobile phone.[^150] Dione claimed that she may have had given a further statement to IO Daphne to clarify Seetha’s involvement in the incident.[^151]

135    I find Dione’s explanation to be self-serving and disingenuous. IO Daphe confirmed that no further statement was recorded from Dione regarding Seetha’s precise role in the incident.[^152] In Dione’s first statement given on 8 November 2016, she specifically stated that Seetha “_was kicking and videoing me at the same time_”. She also stated that “_Santha, Sautha and Seetha started to kick me in my face and head area._”[^153] Her identification of Seetha as one of her assailants was clearly specific and deliberate.

136    Furthermore, I do not understand why Dione would wait until the eve of Seetha’s trial to try recollect what exactly took place some two years back on 26 October 2016. When Dione provided her statements to IO Daphne about the incident, surely that would have been the earliest and best opportunity for Dione to properly recollect the incident so that she can paint an accurate picture of what took place during the incident which she was obliged to do as part of the investigations. I am also doubtful that Dione’s memory would have improved after two years. The inconsistencies about Seetha’s involvement in Dione’s police statement and her evidence in Court are clearly material and is relevant to the issue of whether Dione’s credibility should be impeached.

137    In light of the foregoing analysis, I find that Dione had ‘helped’ Seetha by testifying during Seetha’s trial that Seetha did not physically assault her during the incident. This was an about-turn from her original position that all three sisters physically assaulted her. If she had genuinely recalled and believed that Seetha had not physically assaulted her, she would have told IO Daphne about the same. IO Daphne testified that she was in the dark about this revelation. I do not think there was any ‘agreement’ between Seetha and Dione such that Dione would help Seetha in her criminal proceedings and Seetha would fully bear the Starhub bill as _quid pro quo_. Rather, it would appear that Dione helped Seetha out of goodwill because they had, indeed, enjoyed a close relationship at the material time and Dione took pity on Seetha on account of Seetha’s children. Naturally, Dione became upset when Seetha asked her to pay her (i.e., Dione’s) share of the Starhub bill because in her mind, she had helped Seetha in her criminal proceedings and Seetha should return a favour by paying the Starhub bill.

138    This leaves me with the issue of what to make of Seetha’s conviction. The gravamen of the reduced charge against Seetha was that she had taken a video recording of Dione when her dress was allegedly being pulled up by Santha and Sautha. Notwithstanding that Seetha pleaded guilty to the reduced charge, she maintained in these proceedings that she never took any video recording of the incident. Dinesh and Dione only saw Seetha holding a phone and they assumed she was taking a video recording. There is no evidence that they saw what was on the Seetha’s handphone screen or that Seetha had said anything to the effect that she was taking a video recording. Furthermore, Seetha called for the authorities. To my mind, it is unlikely that she would have done so if she had done anything wrong. Ultimately, it is undisputed that Seetha’s phone was checked by the police on the night of the incident and no such video recording was found. IO Daphne also confirmed that during her investigations, she could not locate any such video recording. It leaves me with questions as to how the prosecution could nonetheless continue to bring a charge against Seetha with such a crucial and material piece of evidence missing.

139    Seetha claimed that she pleaded guilty only because she was aware that if she fought the case on the Section 325 Penal Code charge and was eventually convicted, she could face the same fate as Santha. The choice between imprisonment and a fine made the decision a clear one.[^154] As the High Court observed at \[89\] in _PP v Liew Kim Choo_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 2 SLR(R) 716</span>:

> There were reasons why a person might plead guilty and admit to a statement of facts even though he was innocent and the statement of facts untruthful. These reasons include (a) a very strong Prosecution’s case which might be premised on evidence that is difficult to rebut; **(b) a belief that it is better to plead guilty in the hope of a light sentence rather than to risk conviction and a heavier sentence;** (c) his having been advised by his lawyers to plead guilty because they believe the likelihood of his conviction to be strong although he is not actually guilty; and (d) the accused falling outside of the category of persons eligible for legal aid and yet being unable to afford expensive legal representation, especially in complex cases.

> \[Emphasis in bold added\]

140    There is no question that Seetha’s conviction stands in the eyes of the law. However, given that Dione had possibly either perjured herself when giving evidence in Seetha’s trial, or had perverted the course of justice by giving false information during the initial police investigations, I am invariably left to question the sanctity of Seetha’s conviction.

## Dione’s credibility and the defence’s application to impeach her credit

141    It would be _apropos_ to consider Dione’s credibility at this juncture.

142    The defence submits that Dione’s credit is impeached pursuant to Section 157(c) of the Evidence Act (Cap. 97, 1997 Rev. Ed.). Section 157(c) of the Evidence Act provides as follows:-

> 157.  The credit of a witness may be impeached in the following ways by the adverse party or, with the consent of the court, by the party who calls him:

>> …

>> (c)    by proof of former statements inconsistent with any part of his evidence which is liable to be contradicted.

143    Overall, I find Dione to be a dissembling and untruthful witness, and to call a spade a spade, a compulsive liar. She had been economical with the truth and had been shown up on numerous occasions during cross-examination. I accept that over five years have lapsed since the incident occurred. Witnesses’ memories are imperfect and I accorded a degree of latitude when assessing the inconsistencies in the evidence given by the various factual witnesses. However, Dione flip-flopped on her evidence in Court. She wavered and vacillated between positions. I found her to be defensive[^155] and evasive when answering questions on numerous occasions. This was largely attributable to the fact that Dione was an untruthful witness, rather than a faulty memory.

144    Dione eventually admitted that she lied in her statement to IO Daphne. There is also no question that she lied in court.

145    Essentially, Dione had little regard for the truth and the implications of her lies. The following anecdote best encapsulates this. In the course of cross-examination, the defence obtained a series of Whatsapp messages exchanged between Dione and her sister, Bernice, on the evening of 17 August 2020. This was the first day that Dione took the stand as witness. I reproduce below an excerpt of the relevant messages:-

>   
|

146    The above messages from Dione suggests that Dione and Paal had met up with the learned prosecutor, Mr. Jason Chua, and the IO handling the case, to discuss the case. This implicated Mr. Chua in two ways. First, it would have been highly inappropriate for both Mr. Chua and Dione to be discussing the case when Dione had already begun giving evidence in court. Second, another serious imputation that the messages raised was that Mr. Chua was coaching the witness on what evidence to give in Court.

147    The defence sought leave to cross-examination Dione on the matters raised in the messages. However, this compromised Mr. Chua’s position as the lead prosecutor on the matter as he was a potential witness on this issue. Eventually, the prosecution had to arrange for another DPP to take conduct of the matter whilst Mr. Chua recused himself pending Dione’s answers on the issue.

148    When asked about the messages, Dione claimed, amongst other things, that she could not recall where she was on the evening of 17 August 2020, she did not know what she meant by “chambers”, and she could not remember if she met Mr. Chua that evening.[^156] Dione also took a defensive stance stating that these are her “_private messages_”.[^157] Eventually, after some lengthy questioning, Dione admitted that she lied and that she did not meet Mr. Chua at his office on 17 August 2020.[^158] This lie is corroborated by Exhibit D6, which is the visitor records for the Attorney-General’s Office. It shows that there was no record of Dione entering the office on 17 August 2020.

149    Given Dione’s admission that she had lied in the messages, Mr. Chua was able to resume as lead prosecutor for the case. However, this anecdote serves to show how Dione’s lies, even seemingly innocent ones, had unnecessarily implicated and inconvenienced innocent third parties and nearly threatened to derail these proceedings.

150    The following exchange during cross-examination essentially summarises the extent of her lack of candour in these court proceedings:-[^159]

> Q    Alright. So, Ms Dione, I’m going to now put it to you that by virtue of your testimony in Court this morning and afternoon, you admitted that you’ve lied in Court. Yes or no?

> A    Yes.

> Q    You’ve admitted that you have lied in the message to be sent to Gomethi, yes or no?

> A    Yes.

> Q    But the truth is, you have also admitted that actually no one can really tell when you’re lying or telling the truth. Only you will know, correct?

> A    Yah.

> Q    And you’ve also shown that you are able to mix the truth with a lie. Because 1 message here about fighting with Paal. To create –

> A    Yes.

> Q    the impression that you want to create.

> A    Yes.

> Q    You are an untruthful witness, Ms. Dione, you agree or disagree?

> A    I disagree.

151    Apart from Dione’s untruthfulness, Dione’s conduct in these proceedings also left much to be desired.

152    On day 8 of the proceedings, I noticed that Dione did not look well during cross-examination. I enquired if she required a break and she informed me that she was unwell and that she had been issued a medical certificate by Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (“KTPH”) but did not have it on her. None of the parties had been informed of her medical status. Given the situation, I directed Dione to go to KTPH immediately to consult the doctor if she was feeling unwell and to obtain a copy of the medical certificate and the discharge summary, if any. As it was 12 noon, I directed that the proceedings resume at 3pm. When proceedings resumed at 3.10pm, I was informed that Dione had just reached the hospital. It was unclear why it took her 3 hours to get to the hospital. Regardless, the remainder of the trial day had to be vacated.[^160]

153    On day 10 of the proceedings, Dione was due to take the stand at 9.30am. She overslept and as a result, I had to vacate the morning session and proceedings could only resume in the afternoon. Before the trial was adjourned the day before, I had announced to the entire courtroom that proceedings would commence at 9.30am the next day. Yet, Dione flippantly claimed that she did not know that I was addressing her as well,[^161] a reason which I found to be contrived.

154    On 21 January 2021, being day 12 of the proceedings, Dione took ill. She was issued a Stay-Home Notice (“SHN”) until the results of her COVID-19 swab test was out. The medical certificate that she obtained did not excuse her from court attendance.

155    The next day, _i.e._, 22 January 2021, Dione took ill again. This was after she was cleared of COVID-19 and her SHN had expired. This resulted in another trial day being vacated.

156    On 22 March 2021, which was the first day of the following tranche of trial, Dione informed me that she had difficulties making arrangements for her children and that it was inconvenient for her to attend trial. According to Dione, she brought her 6 year old daughter to Court because there was no one to look after her at home. Notwithstanding that ample notice had been given to parties for this tranche of trial dates which would have given Dione time to make the necessary arrangements, I was concerned that Dione may not be in the right frame of mind to take the stand. As such, I vacated the hearing for the day to allow Dione to work out an arrangement. I had also directed that the proceedings was to commence at 9.30am, even if it was just for Dione to update me on her situation.

157    On 23 March 2021, Dione failed to turn up at the stipulated time. She informed the prosecution that she would not be able to turn up in Court as she had to look after her daughter. As a subpoena had been issued for Dione’s attendance in Court, I ordered Dione to be present in Court at 1.30pm failing which I would issue an arrest warrant against her. When proceedings resumed in the afternoon, I sternly informed Dione that I expected her to comply with all directions and orders made by the Court and that I was dissatisfied at the manner in which she treated the proceedings.

158    Dione’s lack of regard for the court’s directions and orders manifested after the defence had surprised Dione with messages and other evidence that she did not expect would surface in the proceedings. It was clear that her position became quite untenable at that point and she knew that she had been caught lying on various aspects of her evidence given in court. It subsequently became difficult to get Dione to take the stand. Precious trial days had to be vacated. Dione’s reluctance to testify even culminated with her telling me that she wanted to “withdraw the case” as it was taking a toll on her and her family and that it was not worth the while.[^162] I agree with the defence that Dione’s conduct and behaviour in this regard is relevant in assessing her overall credibility.

159    The High Court in _Mohammed Zairi bin Mohamad Mohtar and another v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 SLR(R) 211</span> summarised the law on the impeachment of a witness’ credibility at \[33\] as follows:-

> It is settled law that the credibility of a witness cannot be impeached unless there are serious discrepancies or material contradictions between his oral testimony and his previous police statements: _Muthusamy v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1948\] MLJ 57</span>. “Material” inconsistencies are those inconsistencies that go to the crux of the charges against the appellants: _Kwang Boon Keong Peter v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 2 SLR(R) 211</span>. In determining whether the credit of the accused or a witness has been impeached, the court will compare the oral evidence with the previous statement to assess the overall impression which has been created as a whole: _PP v Heah Lian Khin_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 2 SLR(R) 745</span>.

160    The prosecution sought to rely on the Court of Appeal’s decision in _Alwie Handoyo v Tjong Very Sumito_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 4 SLR 308</span> (“_Alwie Handoyo_”).[^163] In that case, the Court of Appeal cautioned at \[59\] that the court should be wary of the maxim _falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus_ – false in one thing, false in everything. The evidence of a witness need not be rejected _in toto_ simply because it is unreliable or untrue in some parts. The Court of Appeal held at \[61\] that:-

> The correct approach that the court should adopt in such cases is to appraise the witness’s entire evidence in the context of al the other evidence and circumstances of the case. A flawed witness may be telling the truth on some matters: _PP v Chee Cheong Hin Constance_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 2 SLR(R) 24</span> at \[103\]. It is only where the grain and the chaff are so inextricably linked that evidence from a witness who has been shown to be extremely unreliable may perhaps be discarded _in toto_; the mere fact that some part of a witness’s evidence is found to be deficient, unreliable or simply untrue is usually insufficient to justify the rejection of his evidence _in toto_.

161    The prosecution contends that Dione’s testimony should not be rejected _in toto_ simply because she had given inconsistent evidence in a few areas.[^164] The prosecution’s position is that, insofar as the inconsistencies relate to Sautha’s actions during the incident, these can be attributed to a faulty memory, given the passage of time. As regards the inconsistencies in relation to Seetha’s role, the prosecution simply relies on the Court of Appeal’s caution against relying on the all-or-nothing approach.

162    In my view, the prosecution has either failed to appreciate the full extent and gravity of the inconsistencies in Dione’s evidence, or has simply chosen to downplay or whitewash them. This is evident from the sweeping manner in which the prosecution had addressed the inconsistencies in Dione’s evidence.[^165]

163    To my mind, there is no question that the inconsistencies canvassed in my judgment above are material in that they go towards the crux of the charge against Sautha. It is incorrect for the prosecution to submit that only the inconsistencies relating to Sautha’s actions during the incident go towards the crux of the charge. The prosecution cannot run away from the fact that its case has always been about the audio recording and the actions of _all three sisters_ on 26 October 2016. The inconsistencies between Exhibit D3 and Dione’s evidence in Court cuts through the audio recording, the actions of the three sisters, and even the extent of her alleged injuries. As highlighted by the defence, the Case for the Prosecution[^166] states that Seetha had physically assaulted Dione by kicking her. The originally charge against Sautha thus lists Seetha as being complicit to the common intention offence. The charge was subsequently amended. Seetha was no longer deemed to have been involved in physically assaulting Dione. This was due to Dione changing her story about Seetha’s role at the eleventh hour during Seetha’s trial, as explained above. It can hardly be denied that the change in the identities of the alleged perpetrators of the assault, brought about by the inconsistencies in Seetha’s evidence, resulted in a dramatic shift in the prosecution’s case. The prosecution cannot therefore now regard as irrelevant the inconsistencies relating to Seetha’s involvement in the incident.

164    There is no merit to the prosecution’s contention that the inconsistencies can be attributed to a faulty memory. “I cannot recall” was Dione’s mantra. She used that answer whenever she was put in a difficult position and wanted to evade further questioning. It was used one time too many. Dione’s evidence about her memory also beggars belief. She claimed that at the time of the incident, she was unable to recall what had happened due to the trauma that she suffered. Two years later when she was due to give evidence for Seetha’s trial, she could suddenly recall what exactly happened. However, if she had been truly traumatised by the incident and could not recall what had happened, she would have told IO Daphne so. Instead, she was capable of providing a full account of what happened embellished with details. Further, if she had trouble recalling the incident two weeks after it happened, it is puzzling how she could suddenly recall it two years later.

165    Ultimately, Dione has admitted to lying in her statement to the police in Exhibit D3 and also in Court on material aspects of the case. This is precisely the situation where it is not possible to separate the grain from the chaff. Dione has also potentially either perjured herself in Court or has perverted the course of justice by giving false evidence to IO Daphne in relation to Seetha’s involvement. Dione had, by her conduct, shown a blatant disregard for Court orders and directions. Under the circumstances, I have no hesitation in finding that Dione’s credibility has been impeached and that her evidence should be rejected _in toto_.

## Material inconsistencies in Dinesh’s evidence

### Dinesh’s evidence in court

166    During the trial, Dinesh testified that after the group alighted from the vehicle, he walked towards Sathiyan and Henry with the purpose of asking them how they obtained his address.[^167] As Dinesh was walking towards the men, the sisters walked past him. Dinesh therefore did not observe the interactions between Dione and the three sisters because they were behind him while he was engaged with Sathiyan and Henry.[^168] Within a minute, he heard Dione shouting and yelling and when he turned, saw Dione on the floor, in a sitting down position with her dress to her shoulders.[^169] Dinesh did not notice what each of the sisters were doing because his main concern was Dione.[^170] However, according to Dinesh, someone was pulling Dione’s hair,[^171] someone was holding Dione’s hand,[^172] and another sister was standing with her back facing him. Dinesh testified that as he was helping Dione up, he was hit although he did not see who was hitting him.[^173]

167    Dinesh accepted that he did not witness any of the sisters kicking, slapping or using a bag to hit Dione.[^174] Dinesh also did not witness any of the sisters pulling Dione’s dress up.[^175]

### Dinesh claimed to have witnessed the incident in his police statement

168    In Dinesh’s statement to IO Daphne given on 8 November 2016,[^176] Dinesh was asked if he had witnessed the assault. Dinesh’s response was that he “_saw the three cousins were hitting Dione, pulling her hair, pulling her dress and kicking her_”.[^177] In the statement, he also told IO Daphne that:-

> \[5\]    One of the cousins was pulling Dione’s hair and the other two were standing on both sides of Dione, trying to pull her dress up. They were holding her hands down and trying to pull her dress up to her head.

169    The contents of Dinesh’s statement to IO Daphne appeared to be inherently unclear and muddled. They were also materially inconsistent with his testimony in Court. First, Dinesh testified that when he turned around upon hearing Dione’s shouts, he distinctly saw one person holding Dione’s hair, one person holding Dione’s hand and another who had her back facing him. He did not see anyone hitting or kicking Dione. In his statement to IO Daphne, Dinesh says that all three cousins were hitting and kicking Dione, pulling her hair and trying to pull her dress up. Second, Dinesh’s evidence in court was that one sister had her back facing him. In the statement, however, he states that he saw all three sisters were physically assaulting Dione. Third, Dinesh testified that Dione’s dress was already pulled up when he turned around. In his statement, Dinesh however creates the impression that he saw the sisters in the act of pulling Dione’s dress up.[^178] Fourth, the amount of time in between Dinesh turning around and picking Dione up must have been very short considering that they were not that far apart and he ran over to Dione’s aid upon hearing her shouts. After all, Dinesh described the entire incident as “everything happening in seconds”.[^179] It is thus questionable as to how he could have witnessed so many things happening all at once – the three sisters allegedly hitting and kicking Dione, pulling her hair, holding her hands down, and trying to pull up her dress.

170    Importantly, in Dinesh’s testimony, he tries to create the impression the person whose back was facing him was not involved in physcially assaulting Dione. Obviously, this was to corroborate Dione’s change of position that Seetha did not physically assault her. However, Dinesh’s police statement clearly states that he witnessed all three sisters physically assaulting Dione.

171    Dinesh was cross-examined on these inconsistencies and I found his responses to be entirely confusing. On one hand, Dinesh maintained that he did not see any of the sisters hitting Dione and that he could not account for the inconsistencies in the statement.[^180] Then, in the same breath, he said that he “_will never say no_” and it is just that he “_can’t remember_”.[^181] When I sought clarifications to Dinesh’s position, Dinesh agreed that even though his memory would have been fresher at the time the statement was given, which was some two weeks after the incident, his evidence given on the stand should be preferred.[^182] He explained, on numerous occasions, that what was recorded in the statement (Exhibit D13) was based on what he could remember at that time. However, given the lapse of time, the matters to which he testified in court are based on what he can remember at this time.[^183]

172    To my mind, there is no question that Dinesh had prevaricated on this issue. His answers were crafted to avoid having either his testimony given on the stand or his statement being impugned. However, the positions taken in his statement and his testimony are plainly irreconcilable.

173    I find it unlikely that Dinesh had witnessed the assault on Dione. Dinesh and Dione were dating at that time. If Dinesh had truly witnessed the assault on his girlfriend, that would surely have been a significant event to create a lasting impression. Oddly, Dinesh could recall some rather specific details such as someone pulling Dione’s hair, someone holding Dione’s hand, and another taking a video of the incident. But he cannot remember seeing anyone kick, slap or hit Dione with a weighted bag, actions which are more likely to create an impression on an eyewitness.

174    There is also no evidence from Dione that Dinesh told her what he witnessed during the incident. The only such evidence appears in a Whatsapp chat group called “Keepsy & Tipsy” wherein Dione wrote to her sisters on 14 November 2019 at 14.42[^184] as follows:-

> Exactly. How much I fought with Paal. Told him its OK. Made him lie for me. She was clearly one of them, **he repeatedly told me she was the one who was kicking u**, I told him nvm for her kids, they don’t have a father also.

> \[Emphasis in bold added\]

175    It is established that Dione and her sisters were chatting about Seetha and the incident on 26 October 2016.[^185] The message suggests that Dinesh witnessed who were the perpetrators of the alleged assault on Dione. In cross-examination, however, Dione conceded that the entire message was a lie.[^186] Dinesh also denied telling Dione that he saw Seetha repeatedly kicking her.[^187]

176    After much lengthy cross-examination, Dinesh finally admitted that he did not see Sautha assaulting Dione and that his account is based entirely on what Dione had told him immediately after the incident:-

> Q:    So, I’m saying, it’s entirely possible that my client was not doing anything at that time. You can agree or disagree.

> A:    I disagree.

> Q:    Why do you disagree?

> A:    Uh, okay. Why I disagree? I never see --- uh, **I never see wht is happening. I never see, uh, the --- I can’t remember who was playing the role, but on that day, I remember after the incident happened, uh, she, uh --- Ms. Dione told me. So, I’m only agreeing based on, uh, what she said that I disagree --- she, uh --- what she said that she got hit**.

> …

> Q:    what you saw is, it could be entirely possible, my client never touched Ms. Dione, correct? According ---

> A:    Sorry?

> Q:    according to your perception, using your own eyes ---

> A:    Mmm.

> Q:    you were there, right?

> A:    Yah.

> Q:     **What you saw with your own eyes, it’s entirely possible, my --- my client never touched Ms. Dione---**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> Q:    you agree? Yes. Because Ms. Dione can tell you whatever she does ---

> A:    Yes

> Q:    but you didn’t witness it.

> A:    Yes.

> Q:     **So, I put it to you again for the final time, my client, as far as you could see, did not assault Ms. Dione. You agree, disagree? As far as you could see, my client didn’t assault Ms. Dione. You agree or disagree?**

> **A:**      **Agree.**

> \[Emphasis in bold added\]

### Inconsistencies between Dinesh’s and Dione’s evidence, and in his own account

177    I note there were several inconsistencies between Dinesh’s and Dione’s evidence in Court. Dinesh’s account is also internally inconsistent in several aspects.

178    First, Dinesh’s evidence is that when he turned around, he saw Dione sitting on the ground.[^188] He saw one person holding on to Dione’s hair and another person holding her hand.[^189] All three sisters were standing.[^190] However, this is quite different from Dione’s account where she testified that she was lying curled up on the ground. There is no evidence from Dione that she got into a sitting position during the entire fracas. There is also no corroborative evidence that anyone was holding Dione’s hand whilst she was on the ground. The only time someone held Dione’s hand was at the start of the alleged fracas when Sautha held her hand to allow Santha to slap her. This was when Dione was standing and she fell soon after. During the time Dione was on the ground, Dione’s hands were either covering her face or pulling Santha’s hair. Hence, in my view, this is just an attempt by Dinesh to corroborate Dione’s evidence that someone held her hand. He could not have seen anyone holding on to Dione’s hand while she was on the ground.

179    Second, Dinesh said that he was the one who saw one of the sisters using a handphone to take a video of the incident. Accordingly, he told the police to check _their_ phones.[^191] This is obviously untrue as the evidence shows that the police only checked Seetha’s phone. In any case, this is inconsistent with what Dinesh himself said during examination-in-chief which is that Dione told the police to check the sisters’ phones because she was worried there would be a video of her with her underwear exposed. Dinesh’s account also contradicts Dione’s evidence. In Seetha’s trial, Dione testified that she was the one who told the police to check Seetha’s phone because Seetha had been recording the incident. When the police told her there were no videos of the incident, Dione even told the police to “_check in various folders_”.[^192]

180    Third, during examination-in-chief, Dinesh’s evidence was that when he turned around, he noticed one person holding Dione’s hair, one person holding her hand and another video recording. However, during cross-examination, he clarified that he only saw that the third person was video recording as he was bringing Dione away from the scene.[^193] Dinesh appears certain that one of the sisters was recording the incident with her handphone but he never actually saw the screen of the handphone or heard anyone say anything about a recording. He assumed the person was taking a recording based on the manner in which the phone was held. That appears to be a flimsy reason since everything was happening so fast and, if at all, he would only have caught a glimpse of the third person holding handphone.

181    Fourth, Dinesh was cross-examined as to why he was unable to identify the person holding the phone and recording. Dinesh responded to say that he did not see the person’s face because he was “covering” Dione. He had also said earlier in examination-in-chief that he was “holding her face”.[^194] Yet, at the same time, Dinesh made a gesture to show that he was covering his eyes. When questioned, Dinesh confirmed his hands were covering his eyes and he was peeking through “the small spots” as he brought Dione away.[^195] I find it difficult to imagine how Dinesh could be covering both his face and Dione’s face at the same time.

182    Fifth, Dinesh claimed that all three sisters were standing when he turned around. However, according to Dione, Santha was also pulled to the ground when Dione grabbed her hair.

183    Sixth, during examination-in-chief, Dinesh claimed that as he was helping Dione to get away from the sisters, he felt someone hit him with “a hard object like a bag”.[^196] Obviously, the reference to the “bag” is to corroborate Dione’s evidence that she had been hit by a bag filled with heavy objects. However, by the time Dinesh reached Dione, Santha had already stopped hitting Dione with the bag. She would also have been on the ground with Dione, both pulling each other’s hair. Hence, I find Dinesh’s claim unbelievable.

### Dinesh’s credibility and the defence’s application to impeach his credit

184    The defence submits that there are material inconsistencies between Dinesh’s testimony and his previous statements for which his credit should be impeached pursuant to Section 157 of the Evidence Act. Apart from the inconsistency pertaining to whether Dinesh had witnessed the sisters assaulting Dione, the defence also sought to rely on various inconsistencies relating to, amongst other things, the telephone conversation, what took place prior to the scuffle, and about how closely he knew the sisters prior to the incident.[^197]

185    In my view, the inconsistencies in Dinesh’s testimony and his police statements in relation to whether he witnessed the alleged assault were sufficient for me to rule that Dinesh’s credit should be impeached. The alleged assault forms the gravamen of the charge against Sautha. Dinesh effectively lied about being an eyewitness to the assault to corroborate Dione’s account of what happened. This is critical. When IO Daphne was recalled as a witness at the tailend of the trial, she testified that she had preferred Dione’s account to the accounts of the sisters and that it helped that Dinesh claimed to be an eyewitness who saw the sisters physically assault Dione. She confirmed that if Dinesh had not professed to have witnessed the assault, she “_might_” have taken a different view of the case.[^198] Dinesh’s lie in this regard goes right to the heart of this case. There is no question that his credit should be impeached.

## The Defence’s witnesses

### Sautha’s evidence

186    The accused, Sautha, testified that after the five had alighted at Block 96 Geylang Bahru, the sisters had walked ahead leaving Sathiyan and Henry trailing behind. As they were walking, they noticed a man, whom they recognised to be Dinesh, walking towards Sathiyan and Henry. Dinesh walked past the sisters and was shouting as he walked towards Sathiyan and Henry. Sautha was looking in Dinesh’s direction and she was in shock and fear at what was happening. Out of nowhere, Dione appeared and pulled Santha’s hair. Santha lost her balance and fell on top of Dione. Both of them were struggling on the floor but Sautha could not see what they were doing to each other. There was a lot of shouting - Dinesh was shouting; Santha and Dione were also shouting.[^199] Dinesh then started running back towards them. He helped Dione up and brought her away.[^200]

187    Sautha denies that she held on to Dione’s hands whilst Santha was slapping Dione. She also denies kicking Dione.[^201] She denies having any physical contact with Dione or Dinesh during the incident and she did not try to separate Dione and Santha during the struggle.[^202] Sautha also denies that Seetha made any physical contact with Dione.[^203]

### Sautha’s evidence is unshaken in cross-examination

188    Sautha stood firm in her account of what happened during the incident. The crux of the charge against Sautha is her participation in assaulting Dione. The prosecution’s case is that Sautha had held Dione’s hands so that Santha could slap her, Sautha had kicked Dione when she was curled up on the ground, and that Sautha had pulled up Dione’s dress. It would have been critical to elicit evidence of these acts. However, apart from presenting Sautha with Dione’s version of events which Sautha duly denied, and which I find to be mired in inconsistencies and gaps, there was nothing to show that Sautha’s account was internally inconsistent, and there was no objective evidence used to contradict Sautha’s account as to her involvement in the assault.

189    I find that the prosecution’s cross-examination of Sautha largely focused on peripheral issues. For example, a large chunk of the questions during cross-examination was on establishing the relative positions of the various persons at the scene and also of what Sautha witnessed. In doing so, the prosecution clearly failed to make any inroads in proving that Sautha had committed the alleged acts.

190    Even Sautha’s credibility emerged unscathed from the cross-examination. I note that the prosecution had sought to impeach the credit of various defence witnesses by relying on the material inconsistencies in their statements made to IO Daphne. Sautha also provided statements to IO Daphne in the course of the investigations. However, the prosecution did not attempt to do rely on her previous statements in cross-examination to contradict her and to impeach her credit. The logical conclusion must be that Sautha’s evidence in Court is consistent with her police statements.

191    Lastly, I had observed Sautha’s demeanour throughout the entire proceedings, both when she was seated in the dock and when she took the witness stand. Sautha exhibited a calm disposition when giving evidence. She remained firm in her answers and was not defensive or argumentative even when questions were being repeatedly asked. I cannot find any fault with her disposition and demeanour that would impugn her overall credibility.

### Sautha’s evidence is corroborated by Santha’s and Seetha’s evidence

192    Seetha and Santha testified that Dione started the fracas by pulling Santha’s hair. This resulted in Santha falling to the ground. Both Seetha’s and Santha’s police statements are consistent on this.

193    Seetha was consistent in her evidence that Sautha did not hit Dione. She testified that Sautha and Santha “_have no habit of kicking and slapping anyone_” and that Sautha did not physically assault Dione.[^204] In Seetha’s statement to IO Daphne,[^205] Seetha also stated that Sautha did not beat or kick Dione as her “_husband is very particular about her not getting into trouble as he works for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs_”.

194    On this note, I make one observation. It is undisputed that Sautha and her husband were leaving for Germany the next day. Sautha’s husband, Henry, was due to serve a two-year posting in Germany. I find it unlikely that Sautha would have wanted to court trouble the day before departure. It is also unlikely that Henry would have allowed Sautha to get involved if he had any inkling that a physical altercation would ensue.

195    Santha’s evidence is that she did not see what Sautha do as she was engaged in a scuffle with Dione on the ground.

### Inconsistencies between Sautha’s evidence and that of her sisters

196    There were some inconsistencies between Sautha’s evidence and that of Seetha and Santha. For example, Sautha testified that she and Seetha did not try to separate Santha and Dione during the scuffle.[^206] However, in Seetha’s police statement, she stated that Sautha tried to remove Dione’s hand from Santha’s hair. According to Santha’s police statement, it is also stated that both Seetha and Sautha tried to pull Dione away from her.

197    Further, Sautha’s evidence is that she had no physical contact with either Dione or Dinesh throughout. Santha, on the contrary, stated in her police statement that Sautha and Seetha pushed Dinesh when he had come to Dione’s aid. Seetha also claimed in her police statement that Sautha had used her bag to hit Dinesh in his stomach or pushed him to get away.

198    There were also inconsistencies as to what happened prior to the scuffle. Sautha testified that Dione appeared out of the blue and pulled Santha’s hair. In Seetha’s and Santha’s police statements, a different scenario is narrated in which the sisters had spotted Dione and Dinesh after they had alighted at the scene. They then went up to Dione and were engaged in conversation with her before Dione pulled Santha’s hair.

199    The prosecution did not cross-examine Sautha on these inconsistencies, in part because Santha’s and Seetha’s police statements surfaced after Sautha took the stand. However, there was no attempt by the prosecution to recall Sautha to the stand to cross-examine her on these inconsistencies.

200    In any event, apart from being relevant to the issue of Sautha’s credibility, these inconsistencies do not strenghten the prosecution’s case in any way. Even if I accept the narrative set out in the police statements of Santha and Seetha, it still points to Dione as being the aggressor and Sautha was merely coming to the assistance of Santha, who was the victim. There is no evidence in the police statements that Sautha had participated in physically assaulting Dione, which is what the prosecution has to prove. As regards what took place before the scuffle, it is critical to note that it is not even the prosecution’s case that parties were engaged in any conversation prior to the scuffle. Dione testified that there was no conversation between her and the sisters before they allegedly assaulted her. Hence, I do not consider these inconsistencies to be of significance.

### Santha’s and Seetha’s credibility

201    When Santha and Seetha took the stand to give evidence, it would have been hard to reconcile that they were the ones heard on the audio and video recordings cursing and swearing, talking in a loud, brash and uncouth fashion. Before me, they spoke softly and were relatively calm and subdued which, of course, could well have been rehearsed. But their demeanour could also have been affected by the stroke they suffered about a year earlier. A Hospital Inpatient Discharge Summary from the National University Hospital reveals that Santha suffered a stroke on 19 April 2020.[^207] A memo from her doctor states that she “_currently requires a caregiver_”. Santha testified that she suffers from poor memory as a result of the stroke.[^208]

202    As regards Seetha, she too, rather coincidentally, suffered an acute ischemic stroke in April 2020 and a recurrent stroke in July 2020. A memo from KTPH states that, as a result of the stroke, Seetha is now afflicted by aphasia, which impairs her ability to read, write and understand language.[^209]

203    I found Santha’s evidence in Court to be unreliable. I also had doubts as to whether she was a credible witness. Santha purportedly could not recall many events. Amongst other things, she was unable to answer many questions pertaining to her criminal proceedings. She allegedly could not recall going to Bombay in 2017 which resulted in her breaching her bail conditions. In respect of the incident on 26 October 2016, she was able to recall Dione pulling her hair and her Thali chain breaking but had little recollection of anything else, including the phone call that took place just hours earlier. She purportedly could not even remember if the signature on the police statements belonged to her.

204    However, Santha could seemingly recall that when she was giving her police statements, she told the investigating officer that she could not read or understand English. She could also remember being threatened by a male officer during her statement-taking and being told that only if she signed the statement could she be let off. Yet, she could not recall what she told IO Daphne about the incident.

205    The prosecution’s submission resonates with what I had observed during the trial, which is that Santha’s memory appears to be selective.[^210] She purportedly could not recall matters whenever they were against her interests.

206    Conversely, I find Seetha, the eldest sister, to be a credible witness. I accept that there were matters beyond her recollection owing to the stroke that she suffered and the passage of time, and she was generally consistent in her answers.

207    As an aside, midway through cross-examination, allegations were made by Santha that her police statement was given under threat. She claimed that when her statement was being recorded, a male officer shouted at her and banged on the table, placing her under fear, thus raising the spectre of whether her statement had been voluntarily given. I find Santha’s allegations to be dubious. She was unable to provide much details on the incident itself. IO Daphne also testified that during the two occasions when Santha’s statements were recorded, she was the only police officer in the interview room. The defence suggested that a male officer could have walked into the interview room without IO Daphne’s knowledge, for example, when she went out to use the toilet or to collect her documents from the photocopier. However, I find the defence’s theory completely speculative and I reject the same. Accordingly, I find no basis to impugn the voluntariness of Santha’s police statements.

208    The prosecution submitted on the impeachment of Santha’s and Seetha’s credit on the basis of various inconsistencies between their witness statements and their evidence in Court. These inconsistencies concerned the following areas: whether the sisters knew where Dione was when they arrived at the incident location; whether the sisters approached Dione; whether the sisters engaged Dione in conversation before the scuffle started; whether the accused had participated in trying to separate Dione and Santha; and whether the accused had physical contact with Dinesh.[^211]

209    I accept that the inconsistencies in these areas are stark. According to Santha’s and Seetha’s police statements, after the sisters alighted, they spotted Dinesh and Dione drinking. The sisters approached Dione and there was engagement between the parties before the scuffle broke out. Seetha was said to have hurled vulgarities at Dinesh. During the scuffle, Sautha and Seetha tried to separate Dione from Santha. When Dinesh tried to help Dione, Sautha pushed him away.

210    I also accept the likely reason for these inconsistencies is that Santha and Seetha were aligning their version of events as closely with that of Sautha’s. However, I do not think these inconsistencies go to the heart of the charge against Sautha. They are relevant but peripheral issues that, at its highest, go towards the credibility of the witnesses. They would have added colour and provided some context as to what happened before the scuffle. However, neither the version in the police statements nor the version given by the witnesses in Court on the above areas would have improved the prosecution’s case one bit. Hence, i find that these are not material inconsistencies that would justify the impeachment of Seetha’s and Sautha’s credit.

## Sathiyan and Henry did not witness what happened between the sisters and Dione

211    Henry and Sathiyan testified that they did not witness what took place between the sisters and Dione.[^212] This was because their attention was turned to Dinesh, who had walked up to them in a “challenging manner” with his hands behind his back. He was shouting as he walked towards them.[^213] According to Sathiyan, Dinesh had also hurled vulgarities at them.[^214] They had also heard Seetha shout to warn them to be careful as Dinesh may have “something behind his back”. When Dinesh approached Henry and Sathiyan, he was “jumping” around and behaved like a “hooligan”. He allegedly gave Sathiyan a push on his chest such that Sathiyan lost his footing and landed in a small drain.[^215]

212    The prosecution highlighted the discrepancy between Henry’s and Sathiyan’s accounts as to where precisely the initial engagement with Dinesh took place.[^216] However, I consider this to be immaterial. Ultimately, all the witnesses who were present at the scene testified to this initial engagement.

213    Dinesh’s evidence contradicts Henry’s and Sathiyan’s accounts. He claims that he approached them in a calm manner to talk to them. He denies having any physical contact with either Henry or Sathiyan. The prosecution also relies on Sautha’s evidence where she says she did not see Dinesh making any physical contact with Henry or Sathiyan.

214    As with Seetha and Santha, the prosecution also submitted that Sathiyan’s credit ought to be impeached in light of the inconsistencies between his police statement and his evidence in Court.[^217] However, for reasons stated above, I find that the inconsistencies highlighted by the prosecution do not go to the crux of the charge against Sautha. I therefore do not think that Sathiyan’s credit ought to be impeached.

215    As regards the issue of whether Dinesh had pushed Sathiyan during the initial engagement, it is unnecessary for me to make a finding in this regard. This issue has little bearing on the outcome of the case.

## Whether Dione’s dress was pulled up to expose her underwear

216    Dione’s evidence is that she felt her dress being pulled up. She did not see who pulled her dress up. She surmised that it was Santha and Sautha who did so because one was on her left and the other, her right. Dinesh’s evidence is that when he turned around after confronting Sathiyan and Henry, he saw that Dione’s dress was up to her shoulders.

217    The prosecution sought to rely on the video recordings taken by Seetha in the aftermath of the incident to show that the sisters had deliberately pulled Dione’s dress up. The prosecution’s case is that this is corroborative of the assault on Dione.

218    Exhibit P2.1 was a short video recording taken by Seetha after the police had arrived and were talking to Dione and Dinesh. An exchange[^218] between Santha and Seetha could be heard as follows:-

>   
| 

Seetha:

 | 

\[in Tamil\] **No Handa, we pulled her dress uh. Is that obscene? Is that so**? (Translator’s note: said in a tone of denial)

 |
| 

Santha:

 | 

Then who pull my chain la.

 |
| 

\[Emphasis in bold added\]

 |

  
  

219    Further, in Exhibit P2.3 which was a video recording taken after Dinesh had returned to the scene to retrieve Dione’s belongings, Santha was recorded as saying:-

>   
| 

Santha:

 | 

\[in mix of English and Tamil\] Tell the slut, **we made her run on roadside with nothing on her. She walked around in G-string**. Tell her that all the males saw it.

 |
| 

\[Emphasis in bold added\]

 |

  
  

220    The prosecution’s case is that the recordings contain inculpatory and contemporaneous evidence that the sisters were involved in pulling Dione’s dress up. Dione testified that she did wear a G-string that day. Hence, the prosecution contends that Santha would not made any reference to the G-string unless she had pulled up Dione’s dress to expose it.

221    Seetha and Sautha deny seeing that Dione’s dress was pulled up.[^219] Sautha and Santha deny that they pulled Dione’s dress up.[^220]

222    Santha, on the other hand, admits that she saw Dione wearing a G-string. She explained that Dinesh picked Dione up and both were walking away from the scene when she saw that Dione’s dress was up and that she was wearing a G-string.[^221] Santha was still on the ground when she saw that Dione’s dress was up.

223    The sisters have explained that Seetha’s comment was made when the police were speaking to Dione. Dione told the police that her dress was pulled up at which point Seetha questioned, in a tone of denial, if they had indeed pulled up Dione’s dress. The defence thus denies that this is an admission that Sautha and Santha had pulled up Dione’s dress.

224    When cross-examined, Santha admitted that she made the comment about making Dione walk around in a G-string. She explained that she said it because she did see Dione’s G-string as she walked away from the scene. Further, even as Dinesh and Dione were walking away, Dione’s G-string remained exposed.[^222] In response to the prosecution’s suggestion that the comment shows that Santha had caused Dione to be in a state of undress, Santha said that:-[^223]

> A:    I saw it. No one pulled it up, but I saw it --- the ---when she was walking away, the cloth was up. Because she is going with her boyfriend, she could have pulled the dress down, but she didn’t. She is just going. That’s when I saw.

> …

> Q:    So, you see, I’m asking you, why did you say, “We make her run on the roadside with nothing on her”, when you --- if you claim you didn’t do anything at all?

> A:    No. We didn’t make her run, because she, herself ran like that. That’s what I’m saying. At that time, I know what is the words I used. I just --- I saw --- what I saw, I just said.

225    In my view, based on Santha’s evidence, it would appear that Dione’s dress did ride up her body at some point during the scuffle, which resulted in her underwear being exposed. I find it possible that only Santha noticed it, and not Sautha or Seetha, particularly since Santha would have been the only one on the ground at that time.

226    However, I find the evidence on whether Santha and Sautha had pulled up Dione’s dress to be equivocal. First, the comments made by Seetha and Santha may appear inculpatory on its face, but they have to be considered in their proper contexts. The comment made by Seetha was clearly in the nature of a question. They were listening to what Dione was telling the police and when they heard her tell the police that her dress was pulled up, Seetha remarked as she did. As regards the comment made by Santha, that was purely hyperbole. There was no incident in which Dione was made to “_run on the roadside with nothing on her_”. I accept Santha’s explanation that she made the comment only because she saw that Dione’s dress was up and her G-string was exposed when Dione and Dinesh were walking away. In my view, it was likely said in the heat of the moment to spite and taunt Dinesh and that Santha had merely exaggerated the incident.

227    Second, the dress worn by Dione was not a long one. From Exhibit P6, which is a photograph of Dione at TTSH, it can clearly be seen that when she was seated on a chair, her dress barely covered half her thighs. In a scuffle, it is highly possible for the dress to ride up Dione’s body as she curled and squirmed on the ground, without anyone actually pulling it up. Third, Dione’s and Dinesh’s evidence is that Dinesh “hugged” Dione and pulled her up from the ground. Again, this could well have caused Dione’s dress to ride up her body. It must be borne in mind that Dione’s evidence that she “felt” her dress being pulled up by Sautha and Santha is completely uncorroborated. Given the nature of Dione’s evidence in these proceedings and my observations above, there are doubts as to the truth of the allegation. Further, I do not consider the comments made by either Seetha or Santha to have been admissions in any way.

## Seetha called the authorities

228    It is undisputed that Seetha called the authorities to the incident location. It is also undisputed that Seetha’s intention was to call the police, but ended up calling the ambulance instead. In Exhibit P2.3, which was a video recording of the immediate aftermath of the incident taken by Seetha, Seetha can be heard telling Dinesh that they will wait for the police to come.

229    The prosecution’s case is that the accused and Santha had set out with a common intention to voluntarily cause grievous hurt to Dione. This common intention was allegedly formed at the when the sisters were at Santha’s house on the night of 25 October 2016. Seetha was present at the time and she would unquestionably have been privy to whatever plans the accused and Santha had. That being the case, I find it unimaginable that Seetha would have called the authorities on her own sisters.

230    In fact, the prosecution initially took the position that Seetha was also complicit in the incident. Even on its own case as it stand, Seetha is alleged to have taken a video recording of the assault and was a party to it. I find Seetha’s act of calling the authorities quite inconsistent with the prosecution’s case theory that the sisters perpertrated the assault on Dione. I find it most unusual for the aggressors or perpetrators of a fight to be the ones calling the authorities.

231    Furthermore, the sisters did not leave the scene after the incident. They waited for the police to arrive. Sautha testified that after Seetha called the authorities, she told her sisters that she had called for the police and they should wait there for the police to arrive.[^224] I find that Seetha’s conduct in calling the authorities and in asking her sisters to wait at the scene lends weight to the sisters’ narrative that Dione was the aggressor.

## Santha’s and Seetha’s convictions

232    I had dealt with Seetha’s conviction above. Santha had pleaded guilty to a Section 323 Penal Code charge, and was sentenced to 5 months’ imprisonment. The prosecution seeks to rely on Seetha’s and Santha’s decisions to plead guilty, as evidence that Dione was indeed assaulted by the sisters on 26 October 2016.

233    As I had highlighted in the case of _Liew Kim Choo_ (above), defendants elect to plead guilty for various reasons, even if the charge and the statement of facts set out untruths against them.

234    Santha’s evidence in these proceedings is that Dione had appeared out of nowhere, pulled her hair, causing her to fall to the ground. She denies assaulting Dione. Santha testified that she had pleaded guilty to causing hurt to Dione for two main reasons. First, she did not have the funds to retain a lawyer to fight her case at trial as she was ill at the time and had no money. She explained as follows:-[^225]

> A:    I took a lawyer at that time and I had actually paid him a lot of money. What he said was --- okay. I didn’t know that I couldn’t go overseas and he informed me that this was illegal at that time. So, I was remanded and then the lawyer said that, “If you want to coninute fighting, continue talking about this, it will become more costly.” **And I didn’t have the money to pay for any more expenses at that time. So, he advised me and told me that if I pleaded guilty, he will mitigate for me and I will get a lesser sentence. And at that time, I didn’t have any other choice, and because I was very ill and had no money, I agreed**.

> \[Emphasis in bold added\]

235    Second, when Santha pleaded guilty in Court, she had already been in remand for over two months. She was denied bail because she left Singapore on 22 July 2017 for Bombay for prayers whilst on bail, and she had not obtained the Court’s prior permission.[^226] Santha was sentenced to 5 months’ imprisonment on 30 January 2018 and her sentence was backdated to take effect from 28 November 2017.[^227] Santha was released from prison some four weeks after being convicted and sentenced.

236    I would highlight that Seetha’s and Santha’s evidence in respect of them electing to plead guilty to their respective charges notwithstanding their denial that they assaulted Dione, has largely remained unchallenged in these proceedings.

237    It also appears clear to me that the Statement of Facts in support of the charge to which Santha pleaded guilty, is largely based on the accounts of Dione and Dinesh as set out in their police statements. Dione has admitted that she lied in her police statement. As for Dinesh, as I had explained above, he had lied about being an eyewitness to the assault in his police statement. Some of these untruths are replicated in the Statement of Facts to which Santha accepted. For example, in the said Statement of Facts at \[8\], it states that Dione “_did not retaliate and tried to cover her face with her hands_”. As established above, that is plainly not true given that Dione had retaliated by pulling Santha’s hair hard. Further, at \[9\] of the Statement of Facts, it states that “_Dinesh also observed that the victim’s nose was bleeding_”. There is no objective evidence that Dione bled on the day of the incident.

238    The same can be said of Seetha’s case in which she was convicted of an offence for taking a video recording of the assault on Dione. Seetha resolutely denies taking any video recording. There is no objective evidence that she took any video recording save for Dione’s and Dinesh’s assumptions that Seetha was taking a video recording of the incident because of the way she was holding her phone. The police who attended at the scene checked Seetha’s phone on the spot and found no such video recording. IO Daphne confirmed that during the investigations, an attempt was made to locate the video recording but to no avail.[^228] Seetha pleaded guilty to a reduced charge because the alternative was stark – she was aware that if she had contested the original Section 325 Penal Code charge and was convicted, she would definitely face a term of imprisonment. Santha’s case was long over by the time Seetha’s case was being dealt with.

239    I accept that there were good reasons for Seetha and Santha to have pleaded guilty to their respective charges at the material time. Further, it is also my finding that some of the material facts that have sustained their respective convictions are based on untruths. In the circumstances, I am disinclined to rely on Seetha’s and Santha’s convictions as evidence of the assault.

## Common intention

### The law

240    Parties have relied on the recent Court of Appeal decision in _Public Prosecutor v Aishamudin bin Jamaludin_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 2 SLR 769</span> (“_Aishamudin_”) on the interpretation of Section 34 of the Penal Code, in relation to common intention. In _Aishamudin_, the Court of Appeal reiterated that three elements must be present before Section 34 of the Penal Code can be invoked, namely, (a) a criminal act, (b) a common intention between the persons in question, and (c) participation in the criminal act. At \[49\], the Court of Appeal explained what these elements entail:-

> (a)    A criminal act in this context has been defined as “that unity of criminal behaviour, which results in something, for which an individual would be punishable, if it were all done by himself alone” … It refers not to the offence that the individuals concerned plan or carry out, but rather, to an act or a continuum of acts – in short, a criminal design.

> (b)    A common intention refers to a “common design” or plan, which might either have been pre-arranged or formed spontaneously at the scene of the criminal act … This must be the intention to do “the very criminal act done by the actual doer” … This is the critical aspect on which this court in _Daniel Vijay_ departed from the earlier analysis in _Lee Chez Kee_. As this formulation shows, the common intention, strictly speaking, refers not to the intention to commit the offence which is the subject of the charge, but to the intention to do the criminal act, although in many cases, the two will overlap.

> (c)    The parties to a common intention charge must participate in “any of the diverse acts which together form the unity of criminal behaviour resulting in the offence charged … This reflects the principle that “a person cannot be made liable for an offence with the help of s 34 unless he has actually participated in the commission of the crime” … It was also recognised in _Lee Chez Kee_ that participation may take many forms and degrees, and it was held that whether an accused person’s participation in a criminal act is of a sufficient degree to satisfy the participation element and attract liability under s 34 is a question of fact. In this regard, it was noted too that there is no requirement for an accused person to be physically present at the scene of the criminal act in order for him to be liable under s 34 …

241    As regards the actus reus and mens rea of a common intention charge, the Court of Appeal in _Aishamudin_ explained at \[50\] as follows:-

> 50    It is evident from the foregoing that a common intention charge against A for committing an offence pursuant to a common intention with B involves proof of the elements of common intention against both A and B, even if the trial is concerned only with A. In so far as the actus reus of such a charge is concerned, the criminal involved in the offence must be proved to have occurred, with the participation in the criminal act of both A and B. **As for the mens rea, common intention, when broken down to its constituent parts, requires the Prosecution to prove that A had the intention to do the criminal act, that B also had such an intention, and that this was part of a common design between them. Thus, it is not possible for the common intention charge against A to stand if B either did not participate in the criminal act, or did not share the requisite common intention with A. If either or both of these matters are not proved in respect of B (whether or not B is also being tried at the same trial), then there can be no common intention charge involving A and B. A, after all, cannot be said to have a common intention just by himself**.

> \[Emphasis in bold added\]

242    Rather oddly, notwithstanding the guidance provided by the Court of Appeal in _Aishamudin_, parties still diverge on what the mens rea of a common intention charge requires.

243    The prosecution submits that it only has to prove that (i) Sautha and Santha shared a common intention to commit a criminal act which amounts to voluntarily causing grievous hurt, and (ii) they both participated in the criminal act.[^229]

244    Conversely, the defence submits that the prosecution has to prove the following elements for mens rea:-

> (a)     That Santha had the intention to do the criminal act which amounted to voluntarily causing grievous hurt to Dione;

> (b)     That the accused, Sautha, had the intention to do the criminal act which amounted to voluntarily causing grievous hurt to Dione; and

> (c)     That Santha and Sautha having both possessed the intention to do the criminal act which amounted to voluntarily causing grievous hurt was part of a common design between them.[^230]

245    The defence further submits that since Section 325 of the Penal Code envisages two possible mens rea, it was open to the prosecution to prove that Sautha either had the requisite intention to cause grievous hurt or that she had the knowledge that she was likely to cause grievous hurt to Dione.

246    In my view, the prosecution’s reading of the Court of Appeal’s decision in _Aishamudin_ is completely erroneous, and its reliance on _Arumugam Selvaraj v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 881</span> misplaced. The Court of Appeal in _Aishamudin_ had clearly explained at \[50\] of its decision that “common intention” is satisfied only if it is proved that (a) A had the intention to do the criminal act, (b) B had the intention to do the criminal act and (c) this was part of a criminal design between A and B. That being the case, the prosecution has to prove that Sautha and Santha _each_ had the intention to commit a criminal act which would result in grievous hurt to Dione and that this was part of a common design between them.

247    Based on a review of the Notes of Evidence, I agree with the defence’s submissions that the prosecution failed to cross-examine Sautha on whether she possessed the requisite mens rea (intention or knowledge) to commit the criminal act that would result in causing grievous hurt to Dione. The prosecution also failed to cross-examine Sautha about any alleged common design between Santha and her. Expectedly, this resulted in the prosecution also failing to put its case to the accused in this regard as well. Without the opportunity to address such a critical aspect of the charge, the prosecution’s case against the accused must fail.

248    As the High Court in _Parti Liyani v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 187</span> at \[44\] reiterated the importance and significance of the rule in _Browne v Dunn_, as follows:-

> The rationale underpinning the Browne v Dunn rule is so that a witness is granted the opportunity to explain and clarify his or her position or version of facts before any contradictory version is put forth to the court as one of fact. The gist of the rule is sumarised by Professor Jeffrey Pinsler SC in _Evidence, Advocacy and the Litigation Process_ (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2010) at para 20.98:

>> If the cross-examiner has adduced, or intends to adduce, evidence which in any respect contradicts the evidence of the witness being cross-examined, he should put the contradictory facts to the witness so that the evidence of the witness is put into contention (officially challenged), and the latter is given the opportunity to respond. If the cross-examiner fails to put his case to the witness, the court is free to regard the witness’ evidence as undisputed regardless of the nature of the cross-examiner’s case.

249    It should be noted that the next day after Sautha had completed giving evidence in Court, Mr. Chua informed me that he intended to recall Sautha as a witness as he had “_inadvertently not put to Mdm. Sautha … as to whether she had possessed the mens rea of the charge at the material time_”.[^231] The application to recall Sautha was deferred until all the other defence witnesses had completed giving evidence. However, the application to recall Sautha as a witness was subsequently abandoned. Mr. Chua informed me that he had reviewed the position and felt that he had done what was necessary.

250    As it turns out, quite apart from the fact that the prosecution failed to put its case on common intention to Sautha, the prosecution failed to ask any questions on a common design or plan between Sautha and Santha. Surely, this must be fatal to the prosecution’s case.

251    The prosecution contends that the common design was either a pre-arranged plan that is evidenced by the phone call on 25 October 2016, or was made spontaneously as evidenced by the sustained and aggravated manner of the assault.[^232] Notwithstanding my finding above on the issue of mens rea, I will briefly explain why the prosecution’s contention on when the common design was formed lacks basis.

#### The phone call on 25 October 2016 – Evidence of a pre-arranged design

252    The phone call on 25 October 2016 is partially evidenced by the audio recording in Exhibit P1. I have explained above that the audio recording does not contain the entire conversation between the parties. In particular, parts of the conversation at the beginning and the end are not captured in the audio recording. The audio recording may be evidence of animus between the two parties but nothing more.

253    The prosecution submits that the common intention is evidenced by the fact that the sisters had “_harassed the victim and her daughter continuously for over four minutes in a phone call, where Santha also threatened that Seetha’s husband would break the victim’s face_”.

254    I disagree with the prosecution’s submissions. First, during the four-minute audio recording, it is incontrovertible that Sautha’s voice was heard the least. She only made an occasional comment. Even when her voice was heard, it appeared as if it was in the distance. This supports Sautha’s evidence that she was not directly participating in the phone call. Second, the insults and abuses were hurled at Dione by Seetha and Santha, not Sautha. Third, the prosecution sought to rely on two comments that Sautha made in the audio recording to suggest that she was participating in the phone call and that she harboured ill-feelings towards Dione:-[^233]

>   
| 

Santha:

 | 

Ah Mrs World. It’s called Mrs World, not Mrs Bitch.

 |
| 

Sautha:

 | 

**(laughs) That was a good one.**

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

Santha:

 | 

Mrs Bitch, and also Mrs Vagina’s daughter also. (laughs) It’s Mrs World. (laughs)

 |
| 

Sautha:

 | 

**Oh my God.**

 |
| 

\[Emphasis in bold added\]

 |

  
  

255    When cross-examined, Sautha explained that the first comment was made to Santha, not Dione. At that point, she was not aware that Santha was referring to Dione. She had thought that Santha was being witty by changing “Ms. World to Ms Bitch”. As regards the second comment, Sautha explained that this was an expression of shock at the kind of words that Santha used.[^234] The prosecution did not challenge any of the explanations given by Sautha.

256    Fourth, the prosecution submits that an intention to cause injury to Dione can be inferred from the following threat made by Seetha:-

> Seetha:    Do not call my daughter Gomathi. One more time you gonna message her, we will show it to you. Her father want to come down and break your bloody fucking face. Okay?

257    The defence contends that, assuming the threat was to be taken seriously, it was conditional upon Dione calling or messaging Seetha’s daughter Gomathi again. Since there is no evidence that Dione did so subsequent to the phone call, the threat would not have been executed. Furthermore, the threat relates to Gomathi’s father committing the assault, not the sisters. There is also no evidence of Gomathi’s father being involved in the present case. I do not think it is clear that this shows an intention on the sisters’ part to cause grievous hurt to Dione.

258    In my view, if the audio recording is anything to go by, it would suggest that Seetha and Santha had ill-feelings towards Dione. They were the ones who had insulted and verbally abused Dione, not Sautha. If the audio recording is to be regarded as evidence of a common design to commit a criminal act that would result in grievous hurt to Dione, I am not persuaded that Sautha was part of it.

#### Common design made spontaneously during the assault

259    The prosecution’s case, as based on Dione’s evidence, is that the assault started with Santha slapping Dione and Sautha trying to hold Dione’s hands to prevent her from blocking Santha’s slaps. This allegedly happened as soon as the sisters saw Dione. There was no conversation that took place between the sisters and Dione before the assault began. Given the concerted manner in which Santha and Sautha are said to have perpetrated the assault, it would suggest that if there was any common design between the two, that would have been pre-arranged, rather than made spontaneously.

260    In any event, as I have explained above, the evidence on what exactly happened during the incident is equivocal. Dione’s and Dinesh’s accounts are internally inconsistent. They also contradicted each other in material aspects. Both are not credible witnesses as well. I haarbour doubts as to whether there is any scintilla of truth in their versions of events. Conversely, the sisters’ evidence is that Dione started the scuffle by pulling Santha’s hair. Seetha and Santha have denied that Sautha had assaulted Dione. All three sisters have been consistent in their evidence in this regard, not only in their testimonies in Court, but also in their police statements. Accordingly, I find that any common design could not have been formed spontaneously during the alleged assault.

## The injuries

261    Staff Sergeant Siraja attended at the scene on 26 October 2016. He noticed that Dione had some injuries, including a cut on her nose bridge and under both eyes, and recorded the same. Dione went to the A&E department at TTSH subsequently after leaving the scene. Dr. Gabriella Ng attended to Dione. On examination, Dr. Ng found a number of injuries which she detailed in her medical report. The presence of these injuries are largely unchallenged by the defence. The prosecution submits that these injuries clearly show that Dione was assaulted.

262    The defence contends that Dione’s injuries, particularly her fractured nose, were caused by Dinesh prior to 25 October 2016. Seetha testified that Ryan, Dione’s husband, had told her that a day before the incident, Dione had returned home with bruises. She took some pain medication and went to bed straight after. Ryan told Seetha that Dione was beaten up by Dinesh.[^235] Seetha had also informed IO Daphne about what Ryan told her.

263    I agree with the prosecution that the defence’s contention is unsubstantiated by any objective evidence and I reject the same. What Ryan told Seetha clearly amounts to hearsay evidence. The defence failed to call Ryan as a witness. The defence cited difficulties in locating Ryan. However, according to the prosecution, the defence had Ryan’s police statements but there was no attempt to adduce them as evidence. Dinesh and Dione have also denied that Seetha’s allegations although their evidence must be viewed with circumspection considering that they would have an interest in concealing such an incident, and also my finding that neither are credible witnesses.

264    However, I do not think that the presence of the injuries necessarily leads to the finding that Dione was assaulted by both Santha _and_ Sautha. What appears to be common between the accounts of the sisters and Dione is this: both Dione and Santha were engaged in a scuffle on the ground with both pulling each other’s hair. In Seetha’s police statement, she stated that both Dione and Santha could have kicked each other during the struggle.[^236] That could well explain the injuries found on Dione.

265    The presence of the injuries is also not inconsistent with the evidence of all three sisters that Dione started the fracas by pulling Santha’s hair and that the injuries were sustained thereafter during the scuffle. In the latter situation, even if the injuries were caused by the sisters, the complexion of the case would be very different and would certainly not sustain a common intention charge for an offence under Section 325 of the Penal Code.

266    As such, my view is that the prosecution has overreached in its submissions, by drawing a conclusion that Sautha was responsible for causing the injuries found on Dione. It may be objective evidence that Dione did sustain the injuries. However, the injuries alone by no means prove that Dione had been assaulted or even if there was indeed an assault, that Sautha was part of it.

## Lack of objectivity in the conduct of the investigations

267    IO Daphne was the officer who handled the case. When IO Daphne took charge of the case, she was only some two months into the job. In cross-examination, the defence raised various issues concerning the manner in which IO Daphne conducted the investigations. Some of the allegations imputed shoddiness in the way the various statements were taken. For example, in Santha’s case, allegations were raised as to whether IO Daphne should have obtained the assistance of a Tamil interpreter as Santha is illiterate. IO Daphne was also unable to answer why there were discrepancies in the way Santha’s statements were filled up, for example, by omitting to fill in the field which asked for Santha’s highest education level, and also Santha’s second police statement which states that she has one child when she actually has none. The defence sought to play up these discrepancies by alleging that Santha’s statements were not properly recorded and that IO Daphne may have put words into Sautha’s mouth, so to speak. I will say no more about these allegations as the defence appeared to have dropped the pursuit of these issues in their closing submissions.

268    However, there are also allegations raised by the defence, which I find disconcerting, that suggests a lack of objectivity on IO Daphne’s part when she conducted the investigations. During cross-examination, IO Daphne admitted that her mind was set right from the beginning that the sisters were the aggressors and Dione was the victim and the course of the investigations was charted in that direction. It bears reproducing the relevant excerpts of the Notes of Evidence:-[^237]

> Q:    … I’m going to suggest to you that from the very beginning, alright, this case was typeset by the officers on the ground by identifying Ms. Sautha, Ms. Santha, and Ms. Seetha as the aggressors and Ms. Dione as the victim. And you just took that narrative and run with it because you were actually a very new officer and you just saw this, and you took it and you run with it. You can agree or disagree that this note here, the incident log … show that from the very beginning, alright, hours after the incident, officers on the ground identified 3 people as accused, 1 person as victim, correct?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    And this is the narrative that you continued, isn’t it, Ma’am? Because it is already kind of decided for you. These are the victims, this is the accused, right?

> A:    Yes, I began my investigations from there.

> Q:    Okay. And the point also is this, even though the victims --- even though the 3 ladies, Santha, Seetha, Sautha were telling you that actually Dione started the attack, you didn’t put any questions to Ms. Dione specifically as to whether she was the first person to pull Santha’s hair, did you? You look at the questions and answers. Did you have \[sic\] ever pose to her that she was the one who attacked first? Answer is “No.”, right?

> …

> You never posed to her that she was the aggressor, right?

> A:    No.

> Q:    So, again, you see 3 people tell you --- not one, but 3 people tell you later on --- I will just say 2 first. Two people tell you that, “Look she pulled Santha’s hair first.” Right, Ma’am?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    And you never posed that --- at least from the statements we see, you never challenged Ms. Dione to ask her “Did you do that”? right?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    So, you agree, Ma’am, that when you conducted these investigations, you just wholesale adopted Ms. Dione’s position without questioning or challenging her position, right? You just took her narrative isn’t it …?

> A:    … I believed what she said.

> Q:    Yes. And---and that actually you believed in what she said directed your investigations the way that’s \[inaudible\], right?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    If from --- and what --- the thing is that, you see … you’re a young officer, right? I mean in 2016, this case comes along, officers in the grounds say B1, B2, B3, right?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    It’s already typeset, right? It’s already clicked in, right?

> A:    Yes.

> …

> Q:    So, you would agree that if it had been more robust, right, --- I mean at that time, you are 2 months into work, okay. But if this case came to you now after 5 years of experience, you know, and you know not everyone who claims to be a victim is the victim, right? Now, you know that, right?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    You would have been more robust in the investigations and questioned Ms. Dione “Why is it those two are saying that you pulled the hair?” right?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    Alright. That could have been done better, isn’t it in this case? You agree?

> A:    Yes.

269    As the Notes of Evidence reproduced above show, because IO Daphne assumed that Dione was the victim, she never questioned Dione about the narrative put forth by Seetha and Santha, which is that Dione was the aggressor. Amongst other things, the lack of objectivity in the investigation process would also explain the following:-

> (a)     IO Daphne never questioned Dione and Dinesh about their state of mind during the incident and whether they were affected by the alcohol they had consumed earlier. IO Daphne was prepared to assume that Dione and Dinesh were unaffected by the alcohol even though she was not present at the scene and she had never questioned them on the issue. It was only revealed on the last day of the trial when IO Daphne was recalled to the stand, that Dinesh and Dione had been issued a warning for alcohol consumption in public during the prohibited hours. Had the defence known about this, they could have asked for disclosure of police statements and other relevant evidence, if any, on the matter. The prosecution contends that seeking such disclosure amounts to a fishing expedition but I differ in my view. As highlighted above, this could have shed some light on how much alcohol Dione and Dinesh consumed on 25 October 2016 and whether their perception, memory faculties, temperament and judgment could have been impaired or affected in any way, and the relevant witnesses could have been cross-examined accordingly.

> (b)     In Dinesh’s police statement, he stated that he spoke towards the end of the telephone call on 25 October 2016. When Dione handed over the audio recording to IO Daphne, telling her that the audio recording contains a record of the entire telephone conversation, IO Daphne did not question why Dinesh’s voice cannot be heard in the audio recording.

> (c)     IO Daphne did not follow up on Dione’s allegation that Seetha took a video recording of the incident even though such a recording could not be located. She must have continued to believe Dione’s version, which would explain Seetha’s subsequent conviction.

> (d)     The failure to secure the footages of the body-worn cameras that the police officers who attended the scene were equipped with. In oral closing submissions, the prosecution informed the court that the footages had already been overwritten. The footages would have shed light on various matters including the extent of Dione’s injuries given her claim that her nose was bleeding badly.

270    There also appeared to be an attempt to suppress Exhibit D8 from surfacing. Exhibit D8 is an Ambulance Case Record (the “ACR”). It was prepared by the lead paramedic, one Mdm Siti Nur Aisyah Binte Rosmadi (DW5), who attended at the scene. The ACR contains various fields to be filled up in respect of the incident, including the incident number, the patient’s particulars, the time log and the ambulance detail. In the field titled “Events Surrounding Incident”, Mdm Siti wrote the words “_CASE OF VERBAL DISPUTE. NO ONE INJURED. H/O PC T91040 FROM ROCHOR NPC. RETURNING ANR_”. Mdm Siti explained this meant that the case was classified as a “case of verbal dispute”, that no one was injured and the matter was being handed over to the police.[^238] “ANR” meant “ambulance not required”. There is no question that the ACR was a highly relevant piece of evidence.

271    When IO Daphne took the stand on the first day of the trial, the defence asked if she had received a copy of the ambulance report to which she categorically denied:-[^239]

> Q:    And do you have the identities of, at least, the names \[of the\] paramedic team that went down, correct?

> A:    Uh, yes.

> Q:    And you would have, in the course of your investigations, ascertained any report from them?

> A:    Um---

> Q:    Oh, sorry, “obtained” mind my language. Obtained any report from them?

> A:    There was --- it was not a compulsory procedure to ---

> Q:    No, no. My question is whether you did.

> A:    Uh, I did not re --- uh, during investigations, I didn’t retrieve any report from the paramedics.

> …

> Q:    But you know that paramedics will have an --- an account --- an incident report for their attendance, isn’t it?

> A:    Um, from what I understand, their report, um – uh, how should I – the – the report may not detail – might not have so many details involved, uh ---the – the incident itself.

272    This turned out to be completely untrue. When IO Daphne was recalled to the stand on the last day of the trial, she said that she had, in fact, obtained Exhibit D8 sometime in 2017 or 2018.[^240] She had no choice but to come clean on the issue because by then, Exhibit D8 had been disclosed by the prosecution midway through the proceedings after the defence had, on day 15 of the trial, expressed its intention to call the paramedics and ambulance officers as witnesses.

273    This dovetails into the final issue raised by the defence, _viz._, on whether the prosecution had breached its _Kadar_ disclosure obligations (see _Muhammad bin Kadar v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 3 SLR 1205</span>) following the late disclosure of Exhibit D8. There is no question that Exhibit D8 is a relevant document, and one that strengthens the defence’s case. The prosecution’s explanation for not disclosing the document at an earlier stage is that it did not consider the document to fall within the ambit of its _Kadar_ obligations, which of course, says nothing. I also fail to see how the prosecution could credibly advance such an explanation when Exhibit D8, on its face, clearly relates to the incident on 26 October 2016, was prepared by the paramedics who attended the scene, contains a description of the incident (however brief) and states that no one was injured. The extent of injuries suffered by a victim is, on its own, a key element of the Section 325 Penal Code offence. This is not even a situation where the relevance of the evidence in question falls on the borderline for which benefit of the doubt could be given that the failure to disclose is an error of judgment.

274    On day 15 of the trial, the defence informed me that it wanted to call the paramedics and ambulance officers as witnesses. The next day, the prosecution then surfaced the document out of prudence. Questions arise as to what had changed that precipitated the sudden disclosure and why such “prudence” was not exercised earlier. The prosecution was also pressed by the defence and the Court to state when it had come into possession of Exhibit D8. To date, no answer has been forthcoming. To my mind, considering the circumstances holistically, I am of the view that the prosecution had breached its _Kadar_ obligations in respect of the late disclosure of Exhibit D8.

275    As regards the prejudice that would have been occasioned to the defence, it is true that the defence had lost the opportunity to cross-examine the police officers who attended at the scene and Dr. Ng all of whom had testified about the injuries that they observed Dione to have suffered. The defence was entitled to raise a doubt and force the prosecution to explain why the paramedics, who were first to the scene, recorded Dione to have suffered no injuries and subsequently, for the police officers and Dr. Ng to say otherwise. Undoubtedly, these witnesses could have been recalled but at the expense of precious court time and resources. The defence was also forced to take a schizophrenic approach by running two distinct case theories, namely, that Dione actually suffered no injuries from the scuffle, and that she was assaulted by Dinesh the day before. However, apart from the inconveniences caused to the defence, I did not find Exhibit D8 to be a reliable record of Dione’s injuries, especially in the face of the objective evidence from the police officers who attended at the scene, and Dr. Ng who examined Dione a couple of hours later.

276    I conclude my analysis by expressing regret at the lack of objectivity in the way the investigations were carried out and, to an extent, the prosecution of the case. IO Daphne ought to have kept an open mind about the case, investigate and ask the relevant questions, and follow the trail of evidence. However, she had closed her mind to other possibilities at an early stage of the investigations and as a result, failed to follow up on material issues. Perhaps, this may well boil down to a rookie error. However, the repercussions can be far-reaching. As it is, in prosecutions generally, there is an informational imbalance that tilts in favour of the prosecution. The _Kadar_ obligations seeks to level the playing field in that regard. However, if the wide powers accorded to the police in the course of their investigations are not exercised fairly and objectively, resulting in the failure to uncover potentially exculpatory evidence, this may well rob the _Kadar_ obligations of any meaning. For an indigent accused person who is unable to retain the services of a dogged and tenacious defence counsel to dig up such evidence, he may find the odds overwhelmingly stacked against him for which pleading guilty may seem the only option. The role of the police in the criminal justice system cannot be overstated. Once the wheels of the criminal justice system are set in motion, it is almost invariably the case that it will be a life-changing moment for an accused person. The police has a duty in that regard to ensure that they exercise their powers judiciously, impartially and ethically.

## Conclusion

277    In sum, the prosecution’s case rests on the accounts provided by Dione and Dinesh. It is established that Dinesh lied about being an eyewitness. Dione admitted to lying in her police statements and in Court. She prevaricated on many issues and often sought to rely on a faulty memory to evade difficult questions. I took a dim view of her overall conduct and demeanour in Court. Dione had also lied about Seetha’s involvement in the incident. In doing so, she had potentially either perjured herself or perverted the course of justice by lying in her police statements. It was difficult to distill truths from lies from her evidence. I therefore rejected her evidence _in toto_.

278    The sisters testified that Dione started the fracas by pulling Santha’s hair. They had consistently taken this position in their police statements, and in their testimonies in Court. Sautha denied physically assaulting Dione and this is largely corroborated by Seetha’s and Santha’s evidence. Sautha’s evidence in Court was robust – the prosecution failed to leave a dent in her evidence or cast doubt on her credibility as a witness. Critically, the prosecution failed to ask Sautha any questions and put its case to Sautha on the issue of mens rea and common intention. This alone would have been fatal to the prosecution’s case.

279    Eventually, there was one crucial fact that was common to both parties, _viz._, that both Santha and Dione were pulling each other’s hair on the ground. This could well explain the injuries that Dione sustained.

280    Having regard to the foregoing, I find that the prosecution has not proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The accused, Sautha Letchumi d/o Supramaniam, is hereby acquitted.

281    On a final note, I am grateful to Mr. Chua and counsel for their hard work on this case which had, for various reasons, resulted in a rather protracted trial. In particular, I wish to commend Mr. Kalidass and his outstanding and hardworking second chair, Mr. Ashvin, for their meticulousness in the conduct of the defence. Mr. Kalidass had taken reasonable and fair positions throughout the proceedings. As a defence advocate, he is thorough and presents his arguments in a well-articulated, coherent and persuasive manner.
