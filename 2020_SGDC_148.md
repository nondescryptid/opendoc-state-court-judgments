3       Five other PHTA charges, and five other Passports Act charges, were stood down.

4       At the conclusion of trial, I was not satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case on all proceeded charges beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I acquitted the Accused of all proceeded charges. The Prosecution was dissatisfied with the acquittal, and has filed an appeal against the acquittal. The Accused is on bail pending appeal.

5       I shall now set out my grounds of decision.

## Facts

6       The Accused was at all material times a manager in Taraana Pte Ltd (“the Company”).[^1] The Company operated a music lounge at 33B Circular Road, named Taraana Hindi Music Lounge (“Taraana Club”). The Accused ran Taraana Club together with DW9, Balakrishnan s/o Jaganathan (“Balan”), who was her husband and the Director of the Company.[^2]

7       Victim 1 and Victim 2 (collectively referred to as “the Victims”) both entered into employment contracts with the Company as performing artistes at Taraana Club on 28 August 2015 and 12 June 2015 respectively.[^3] The Victims were paid approximately 50,000 Bangladeshi takas or S$800 monthly.[^4] At all material times, the Victims resided at the accommodation provided by the Company (“the Accommodation”).[^5]

8       Investigations by the police commenced in September 2015.[^6] The case was referred to the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) with information that a girl was being confined by her employer and was not allowed to leave employment and the Accommodation. As part of MOM investigations, on 7 October 2015, PW1, Elwin Kuah (“IO Elwin”), a Senior Investigation Officer in MOM, inspected the Accommodation.[^7] However, MOM assessed that the threat to the performing artistes was not immediate.[^8] The performing artistes, including the Victims, continued to reside at the Accommodation. IO Elwin met the performing artistes again on 1 and 2 March 2016.[^9]

9       On 2 March 2016, IO Elwin and his colleagues found the performing artistes unwilling to work for the Company.[^10] The performing artistes left the employment of the Company after 2 March 2016, and were housed by MOM.[^11]

## Case for the Prosecution

### PHTA charges (C3 and C7)

10     The Prosecution alleged that the Accused had harboured the Victims by means of abuse of power for the purpose of exploitation (_to wit_, servitude) in Singapore. According to the Prosecution, the Accused and Balan ran Taraana Club together, and were the alter egos of the Company.[^12] They were responsible for the working and living conditions of all performing artistes employed at Taraana Club, including the rules and regulations that the performing artistes had to abide by.[^13]

11     The Prosecution submitted that the Accused and Balan had power over the Victims as employers.[^14] The Victims were poor and lowly educated foreigners who had to rely on the Accused and Balan for their survival.[^15] Further, the Prosecution submitted that in order to keep the Victims in employment, the Accused and Balan abused their power over them in the following ways[^16]:

> (a)     Curtailing their freedom of movement inside and outside the Accommodation, by prohibiting them from leaving the Accommodation without permission, and keeping them under close monitoring when they were allowed outside;

> (b)     Keeping them under CCTV surveillance at work and in the Accommodation;

> (c)     Curtailing their freedom of communication, by restricting their access to personal mobile phones, and limiting their opportunities to contact their families and outsiders;

> (d)     Imposing an unlawful and onerous obligation that they pay a large sum of money in the event that they terminated their employment prematurely, when it was financially impossible for them to do so;

> (e)     Requiring the Victims to purchase expensive lehenga (a traditional costume), which further added to their financial lack of freedom;

> (f)     Making them sign employment contracts which contain unlawful and unfair contractual terms, and not explaining the contracts to them, with the intent that the contracts could be enforced against the Victims if it were in their interests to do so;

> (g)     Confiscating their passports for the entire term of their employment; and

> (h)     Creating a culture of fear and compliance.

12     The Prosecution submitted that the abuses of power rendered the Victims financially, physically and psychologically unable to leave the Company’s employment for the period of the contracts.[^17]

13     Further, it was the Prosecution’s case that the Accused and Balan had harboured the Victims so that they could exploit them through their servitude in Taraana Club - i.e. so that they were bound to work at Taraana Club for the entire six-month contractual period and were not free to leave whenever they wanted.[^18]

14     The Prosecution indicated that the Victims were brought on outings such as to restaurants.[^19] However, the Prosecution submitted that these transient acts did not affect how the Victims were exploited by the Accused and Balan.[^20]

### Passports Act charges (C10 and C14)

15     The Prosecution submitted that the Accused and Balan had a policy of retaining possession of all the performing artistes’ passports for the entire six-month employment period in order to prevent the performing artistes from leaving Singapore.[^21] The Accused had asked Victim 1 for her passport when the latter arrived on 28 August 2015 and had obtained it. Victim 1 did not wish to give her passport, but felt she had no choice but to comply.[^22] Balan had asked Victim 2 for her passport when the latter arrived on 12 June 2015 and had obtained it. Victim 2 initially refused to hand over her passport, but eventually did so because Balan insisted - she felt that she had no choice but to do so.[^23] The passports would only have been returned to the Victims at the end of their employment contracts had the investigations by MOM not begun.[^24]

16     According to the Prosecution, there was no reasonable excuse for the Accused and Balan to keep the Victims’ passports.[^25]

### Prosecution’s applications to substitute statements of three Defence witnesses in place of their testimonies

17     During the course of trial, the Prosecution sought to show that the testimonies of some Defence witnesses (DW2 Yuliana Bani (“Ana”), DW5 Akter Mst Switi (“Switi”), and DW10 Malialagan s/o Appavoo (“Mathi”)) were materially inconsistent with their earlier statements recorded by MOM.[^26] Accordingly, the Prosecution applied to substitute the oral testimonies of these witnesses with their previous inconsistent statements.[^27] At the material time, Ana was Balan’s domestic helper who resided at the Accommodation, Switi was a performing artiste with the Company (until about 6 January 2016[^28]), while Mathi was the Company’s appointed driver.

18     In support of its submission, the Prosecution relied on sections 147(3) and 147(6) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“EA”). The Prosecution also urged the Court to impeach the credibility of the three Defence witnesses pursuant to section 157(c) of the EA.

19     It is clear that the statements of Ana, Switi and Mathi could be made _admissible_ under section 147(3) of the EA - the provision states that a previous inconsistent or contradictory statement made by a person called as a witness is admissible as evidence. As there were inconsistencies in the respective statements of Ana, Switi and Mathi, I allowed the Prosecution’s application to admit the statements into evidence. The issue then was how much _weight_ should be attached to the statements of Ana, Switi and Mathi.

20     Section 147(6) of the EA states that in estimating the weight to be attached to a statement admissible in evidence by virtue of section 147, regard must be had to all the circumstances from which any inference can reasonably be drawn as to the accuracy or otherwise of the statement and in particular, whether or not the statement was made contemporaneously with the occurrence or existence of the facts stated, and whether or not the maker of the statement had any incentive to conceal or misrepresent the facts.

21     It is trite that the following factors would also be taken into account:

> (a)     An explanation of the inconsistency and why the statement is an accurate representation of the facts would _materially affect_ the weight to be accorded to a prior inconsistent statement; and

> (b)     The context of the statement. This requires a consideration of all the circumstances affecting the accuracy of the statement.

> (_Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 619</span> at \[71\])

22     The Prosecution had also submitted that Ana’s oral testimony in court which was inconsistent with her statements should be rejected in place of her statements. I noted at the same time that section 147(6) of the EA requires the court to treat the admitted previous inconsistent statement as a separate piece of substantive evidence and to attribute to it the proper weight after a careful scrutiny of the totality of the evidence before the court. After careful consideration of all the circumstances, I did not place much weight on her statements for the following reasons:

> (a)     I considered Ana’s explanation when asked why her testimony was different from what she stated in Exhibit P12, which was her statement recorded by MOM. She testified that she had tried to inform the recording officer, one Derrick Teng (“Derrick”) of the truth, but was told that what she said was _“different”_ from what the Accused and the performing artistes testified. It was in such circumstances that she told him: _“in that case, I will just follow them_.[^29]_”_ She testified that she signed Exhibit P12 as she was afraid - she had been accused of lying[^30]. When Prosecution suggested that she could have complained if she felt pressure or if she thought she was being made to sign an untrue statement, Ana testified: _“I felt very pressured because--the 1_st_reason, because my brother passed away. 2_nd_, because they did not give me my passport. The 3_rd_one, because they will charge me in Court. And 4_th_, because this is not my country.[^31]”_

> (b)     This is further buttressed by the testimony of PW8 Lee Jia Yi (“Lee”), one of the recording officers from MOM. Lee stated that the statement recording for Ana occurred _“because Ana was wanting to go back to her home country for something urgent that happened at home.[^32]”_ This appears to corroborate Ana’s testimony, and illustrates Ana’s state of mind when she gave her statements in Exhibit P12. In my view, this raised the question of whether the statements contained in Exhibit P12 may be untruths - Ana conceivably could have given the statements simply to comport with the statements of the other witnesses, so that she could leave Singapore quickly to go back to her home country as her brother had passed away.

> (c)     I had also observed that Derrick never testified either as the Prosecution’s witness or as a rebuttal witness. Accordingly, the Court never had the benefit of Derrick’s evidence which could confirm or contradict Ana’s testimony of the events which occurred prior to her statements being recorded. I noted that the Prosecution made efforts to try to contact Derrick and to produce him in Court. However, the result of Derrick not testifying is simply that the Court only has Ana’s testimony on the recording of the statements. In light of the allegations made which were not contradicted or confirmed, it would be unsafe to rely on Exhibit P12.

> (d)     In relation to Exhibit P11, which was also her statement recorded by MOM, Ana testified: _“This is not my word”_.[^33] I observed that a different _“worker name”_ was reflected, one _“Peterson”_, instead of Ana’s name on the bottom right of page 2 of Exhibit P11. Still, Ana signed that page. To my mind, this raised some doubt as to whether Ana had signed Exhibit P11 without actually agreeing to what she was signing, given that she could not have _agreed_ to adopt a different name in her statement. I therefore did not think it safe to rely on Exhibit P11.

> (e)     I highlight also that the mere fact that Ana was earning less previously in Indonesia before her employment with the Company did not necessarily mean that she had a motive (that she _wanted_ potential employment with the Accused) to lie.[^34] It is crucial to consider that these salaries do not provide a fair comparison since they were earned in completely different countries altogether, without any reference to the costs of living involved in the respective countries.

23     As with Ana’s statements, I also did not accept the Prosecution’s submission that Switi’s testimony in Court which was inconsistent with her statements recorded by MOM (Exhibits P13, P15 and P16) should be rejected in place of her statements. I also did not place much weight on her statements for the following reasons:

> (a)     Switi testified that the recording process of Exhibits P13, P15 and P16 was improper. She testified that she was instructed by Derrick to _“make the boss \[look\] as bad as possible”_ prior to an interview by AGC[^35], because _“that will be better for \[her\]._[^36]_”_ Switi testified that Derrick told her: _“Whatever you are been \[sic\] taught now you will tell the lawyers._[^37]_”_ She testified that Exhibits P13, P15 and P16 was already pre-prepared and she was simply made to sign it.[^38]

> (b)     Crucially, in respect of Exhibit P13 (a statement recorded by Derrick), I observed that the name of _Akter Swapna_ (one of Taraana Club’s performing artiste) appears on the bottom right of one of the pages.[^39]_Yet_, Switi had signed on Exhibit P13. This was evidence which casted doubt on whether Exhibit P13 was Switi’s own words, or whether her statement was pre-prepared. It also suggested that Switi signed Exhibit P13 without actually agreeing to its contents. Further, in respect of Exhibit P15, I observed that both the alleged recording officer, Ms Lee Jia Yi (“Lee”), and the Bengali interpreter, were unable to state whether Derrick had interviewed Switi _before_ Lee recorded her statement.[^40]

> (c)     Similarly, I considered that Derrick never testified either as the Prosecution’s witness or rebuttal witness. Accordingly, the Court never had the benefit of Derrick’s evidence which could confirm or contradict Switi’s testimony of the events which occurred _prior to_ her statements being recorded. The Court only has before it Switi’s testimony and the above evidence on the recording of the statements. In light of the allegations made which were not contradicted or confirmed, it would be unsafe to rely on Switi’s statements.

24     In relation to Mathi, I did not place much weight on either his statement recorded by MOM (Exhibit P17) or his testimony in Court. I considered that Mathi did not provide a convincing explanation as to the inconsistencies between his statement and his testimony. I also considered that it was not safe to rely on Mathi’s evidence because he had a possible motive to state untruths - Mathi had first approached Balan in 2004 because Mathi had a business then which was _“losing money”_ and Mathi was unable to manage and pay rentals. Balan had taken over this business and had offered him a job.[^41] In these circumstances, I was therefore of the view that his evidence was more likely to be biased.

## Case for the Defence

### PHTA charges (C3 and C7)

25     The Defence did not dispute that the Victims were harboured.[^42] However, the Defence denies that the Victims were harboured by means of abuse of power.[^43] The Defence led evidence from former performing artistes of Taraana Club and Ana to show that the performing artistes:

> (a)     Had freedom of movement and could leave the Accommodation to purchase food and necessities as they wished[^44];

> (b)     Were provided with abundant food and drink[^45];

> (c)     Had regular outings to Mustafa Centre and regular leisure outings to restaurants and other places[^46];

> (d)     Were not forced to achieve tips targets set by the Accused or to allow customers to physically in order to achieve tips targets[^47];

> (e)     Were not subjected to physical or verbal abuse, or strip searches[^48]; and

> (f)     Had a good relationship with the Accused and felt that they were part of a family.[^49]

26     It was the Defence’s position that the Accused did not take advantage of the poor financial state of the Victims, but had instead paved the way for them to find a way out of their poor socio-economic situations.[^50] The Defence sought to show that the Accused and Balan had made advance payments to the Victims, paid for their food, transport and accommodation and had brought them out regularly to attractions and to dine at restaurants.[^51]

27     Further, the Defence denied that the Victims were harboured for the purpose of servitude. The Defence sought to show that both the Victims did not: (a) request for any changes in the conditions of their contract; and (b) raise any complaints when MOM inspected the Accommodation on 7 October 2015.[^52] According to the Defence, it was not the case that the Victims could not change or escape from the conditions of their employment, but that they had no need to change or to escape from the conditions of their employment.

28     I should add at this juncture, that the Defence had submitted detailed written submissions when it made its submission of no case to answer (“NCTA”) at the close of Prosecution’s case. After hearing parties’ submissions, I ruled that the Defence had a case to answer as there was some evidence not inherently incredible which satisfied each and every element of the proceeded charges.[^53] Nevertheless, I noted that the Defence maintained its NCTA submissions in some respects during the course of trial and in its closing submissions.[^54] Therefore, I will refer to the Defence’s NCTA submissions in the later parts of this decision.

### Passports Act charges (C10 and C14)

29     The Defence disputed that the passports of the Victims were retained by the Accused.[^55] According to the Defence, their passports were kept in the Company’s office.[^56] The Accused testified that the passports were safekept by the Company to mitigate against the passport being misplaced and for the purposes of making any necessary applications.[^57] In any event, the Defence submitted that the Accused had a reasonable excuse to retain the passports of the Victims within the meaning of s 47(7) of the Passports Act.[^58]

## Issues to be determined

30     The issues to be determined are as follows:

> (a)     Assessment of evidence of witnesses, including the Victims;

> (b)     In relation to the charges under PHTA (C3 and C7):

>> (i)       Elements required to establish a charge under s 3(1) of the PHTA;

>> (ii)       Whether the Accused’s harbouring of the Victims was by means of abuse of power; and

>> (iii)       Whether the Accused’s harbouring of the Victims was for the purposes of exploitation, i.e. _servitude_, as set out in C3 and C7.

> (c)     In relation to the charges under the Passports Act (C10 and C14):

>> (i)       Whether the elements required to establish both charges under s 47(5) of the Passports Act are established, including whether the Accused had a reasonable excuse to have possessed or controlled the passport.

## Issue 1: Assessment of evidence of witnesses

31     A significant part of the case was dependent on the witnesses’ credibility. In assessing the witnesses’ credibility, I was mindful of the need to consider their demeanour, internal consistency or lack thereof in the contents of the witness’s evidence, and external consistency or lack thereof between the contents of the witness’s evidence and the available extrinsic evidence: _PP v GCK and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 486</span> (_“GCK”_).

32     The present case was an unusual case. Both the Prosecution’s and Defence’s witnesses were generally unreliable and lacked credibility. This included both the Victims. Given the case mounted by the Prosecution, the nature of the charges, and also the Prosecution’s reliance (almost exclusively) on the oral testimony of the Victims, I gave careful attention to the Victims and had observed them with enhanced scrutiny while they were testifying in court. There were internal and external consistencies in their evidence, and their evidence in several areas was inherently improbable. I observed that they had adroitly used exaggerated statements, extreme body gestures, even flowing tears and hyperbole during the course of their testimonies. I will address the inconsistencies and contradictions throughout this grounds of decision. The Victims did not at all impress me as being creditworthy witnesses. In my judgment, the testimonies of the Victims, put simply, did not have the ring of truth.

33     At the same time, I should emphasise that in assessing the Victims’ credibility, I was acutely mindful that the testimonies of victims of human trafficking may be riddled with inconsistencies, exaggerations and omissions given their vulnerability and the trauma that they have undergone. I also noted that the lapse of time and fallibility of human memory could result in minor inconsistencies. However, there were _material_ inconsistencies and omissions by the Victims in the present case. There were also a lack of corroboration of the Victims’ testimonies with that of other performing artistes, and importantly, objective, contemporaneous evidence (addressed at \[66\]) which illustrated the fond relationship between: (a) the Victims and the Accused; (b) the Victims and Balan; and (c) other performing artistes and the Accused; and (d) other performing artistes and Balan. This was materially and significantly, inconsistent with the Prosecution’s case and tended instead to corroborate the Defence’s case.

## Issue 2: Elements required to establish a charge under s 3(1) of the PHTA

### Overview of elements

34     I begin with addressing the PHTA charges. There are three elements to be established for a charge under s 3(1) of the PHTA:

> (a)     An act - in this case, charges C3 and C7 specify the act as that of _harbouring_ the Victims respectively;

> (b)     By certain means - charges C3 and C7 specify the means as that of _abuse of power_; and

> (c)     For the purpose of exploitation - charges C3 and C7 specify the form of exploitation as _servitude._

>> (i)       “Exploitation” is defined in s 2 of the PHTA to include, amongst other things, servitude.

35     In assessing whether the elements are established, I was mindful that Parliament had contemplated for the thresholds for a human trafficking offence to be _“appropriately high”_ - the Prosecution must show that all three elements (the act, means and purpose) are established: MP Mr Christopher De Souza, _Response Speech on Prevention of Human Trafficking Bill_ (3 November 2014). This is fundamental given that human trafficking is a serious offence carrying severe penalties, and acts as a safeguard: (a) to ensure that lesser violations are not incorrectly elevated into trafficking offences; and (b) against false claims of trafficking.

### Key disputed elements in this case

36     At trial, the Defence did not dispute that the Accused did harbour the Victims. In any event, I found that this element was established. The PHTA does not define the term “harbour.” I accepted the Prosecution’s submission that harbour is ordinarily understood as providing food or shelter.[^59] This is consistent with the definition of “harbour” in other statutes such as the Immigration Act (Cap 133) (Rev Ed 2008) and the Penal Code (Cap 224) (Rev Ed 2008). The Accused had provided food and shelter to the Victims.

37     The Defence disputed the latter two elements of the PHTA charges - i.e. that the Victims were harboured _by means of abuse of power_, and for the purpose of _servitude._[^60] These issues are addressed accordingly.

## Issue 3: Whether the Accused’s harbouring of the Victims was by means of abuse of power

38     I considered whether the Accused had harboured the Victims _by means of abuse of power._

39     The term “abuse of power” is not defined in the PHTA. The term is also not defined in the United Nations (UN) Protocol to Prevent, Supress and Punish Trafficking in Persons (“TIP Protocol”), which the PHTA was based on. The Prosecution submitted that “abuse of power” appears to be a general concept referring to relationships where there is an imbalance of power between the parties, which is then misused by one party against the other.[^61]

40     I considered a related phrase of “abuse of position of vulnerability” which was defined in section 2 of the PHTA. In my judgment, the phrase “abuse of power” simply means, in relation to an individual, taking advantage of a victim through whatever means.

### Evidence did not corroborate Prosecution’s case

41     However, the evidence before the Court did not corroborate the Prosecution’s case in relation to whether the Victims were harboured by means of abuse of power. There was a lack of evidence suggesting that the Accused and Balan had taken advantage of the Victims. I proceed now address the Prosecution’s submissions on the element of abuse of power accordingly.

#### Alleged curtailment of freedom of movement

42     Firstly, the Prosecution submitted that the Accused and Balan imposed rules which limited the Victims’ freedom of movement.[^62] According to the Prosecution, this was one such way the Accused and Balan abused their power to continue to harbour the performing artistes. The Prosecution submitted that:

> (a)     The Victims were not allowed to go out of the Accommodation on their own without the Accused’s permission.[^63]

> (b)     The Victims were physically locked in the Accommodation - there were padlocks in the Accommodation and the Victims did not have keys to any of the doors or locks.[^64]

> (c)     The Victims were monitored and supervised when they were allowed to leave the Accommodation, including by the Accused, Balan, Mathi, one Elvis (who was the dance instructor in Taraana Club) and/or one Ravinder Singh (“Cheena”) (who was the disc jockey in Taraana Club).[^65]

43     However, Victim 1’s evidence on the alleged restrictions to her movements was internally inconsistent.

> (a)     During examination-in-chief, she testified that she was not allowed out of the house and that once a month she was taken to Mustafa Centre to buy cosmetics, for the purposes of her work.[^66] However, during cross-examination, she admitted that she had been to _other places_, including: a shop which sold Nasi Lemak, and 7-Eleven.[^67] It was also only at the stage of cross-examination that Victim 1 testified that she could leave the house to these shops near the Accommodation if she collected more than $700 to $800 in tips. This alleged condition to her freedom of movement was not mentioned during examination-in-chief.

> (b)     During cross-examination, Victim 1 recounted an incident where she had left the Accommodation _alone and unaccompanied_ - when she took a taxi by herself from the Accommodation.[^68]

44     Crucially, both Victims testified of a different _condition_ to their freedom of movement. While Victim 1’s evidence was that a performing artiste had to earn at least $700 to $800 in tips and obtain the Accused’s permission in order to go out of the Accommodation, Victim 2 testified that the performing artistes could leave the Accommodation three months after arrival, _unaccompanied_, to buy food if they sought the Accused’s permission.[^69] Victim 2 did not suggest that she had to earn any amount of tips before she could go out of the Accommodation. I found this to be a material inconsistency which creates doubt as to whether the Victims were speaking the truth on alleged restrictions to their freedom of movement.

45     For completeness, I note that the Prosecution had submitted that the timing at which the Accused had started allowing Victim 2 to go out with her permission coincided with the start of MOM investigations - i.e. September 2015, which was three months after Victim 2’s arrival on 12 June 2015.[^70] However, it is important to observe that Victim 1 never testified that from September 2015, which was when Victim 1 first arrived in Singapore, she was permitted to leave the Accommodation with the Accused’s permission. Again, there was an inconsistency between the testimonies of the Victims.

46     Other performing artistes of Taraana Club (including those who resided at the Accommodation at the same time as the Victims) had also consistently indicated that there were no restrictions on movement:

> (a)     Both Switi and DW3 Khanum Taslima Rane (“Rane”) testified that the key to the Accommodation held by Elvis could be used by the performing artistes:

“Q

 | 

Who had access to the key that was for Elvis and the girls?

 |
| 

A

 | 

**That key**, bhaiya and **we could use**.”[^71]

 |
| 

Cross-examination of Rane

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, you and the girls did not have your own keys to the accommodation?

 |
| 

A

 | 

No. There was only 1 key that placed it on the table.

 |
| 

Interpreter:

 | 

He \[sic\] say, “I do not know that---where is there any other spare keys or not **but there is 1 key, it was placed on the table, and Elvis bhai also used this key.”**

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Okay. Ms. Rani, I’m going to put it to you that you and the girls were not allowed to go out---to use any key to go out of the house without Madam’s permission and if you were not accompanied by someone.

 |
| 

A

 | 

**Disagree.”** [^72]

 |

  
  

> (b)     Switi denied that there were conditions which had to be satisfied before she could leave the Accommodation.[^73] In her own words, _“I was free to go.”_[^74] Even though Switi left the Accommodation accompanied during her own free time to visit shops, this was because she _wanted_ to be accompanied by her colleagues - as opposed to the Accused setting restrictions on movement in this regard.

> (c)     Rane during cross-examination testified that there were occasions when she used to leave the Accommodation unaccompanied. She also testified that when she was accompanied, it was because she had _requested_ for the Accused, Elvis or Cheena to accompany her out of the Accommodation.[^75]

47     Further, it could not be true that the Accused and Balan monitored and supervised the Victims out of the Accommodation. The Victims had been brought by the Accused and Balan to places where there were high volumes of people (e.g. Mustafa Centre) on a routine basis - at least once a month.[^76] If the Accused and Balan intended to monitor and supervise the performing artistes, there is no reason why the performing artistes would be brought to places where there were large crowds of people. This would make any form of supervision or monitoring difficult. Indeed, it would even facilitate the easy escape of the Victims, if as alleged by the Prosecution, the Victims were truly being exploited and being kept in servitude.

48     Taken together, the above analysis illustrates that there is doubt as to whether the freedom of movement of the Victims was curtailed.

#### Alleged curtailment of freedom of communication

49     Secondly, the Prosecution submitted that the Accused and Balan curtailed the freedom of communication of the Victims. According to the Prosecution, this was another way by which the Accused and Balan abused their power while harbouring the performing artistes.[^77] The Prosecution’s submission in this regard had three planks:

> (a)     The Victims had no access to their personal mobile phones, as these were taken away from them when they arrived in Singapore and kept in the Accused’s rooms. Company phones were provided, but their usage was strictly limited.[^78]

> (b)     The Victims had strictly limited opportunities to contact their families. They were supervised when they made personal calls. They were only allowed to talk to their families for half an hour every Sunday on their company phones.[^79]

> (c)     The Victims were prohibited from telling customers of their plight.[^80]

50     However, in relation to the submission at \[49(a)\] and \[49(b)\], other performing artistes of Taraana Club had testified that there were no restrictions in making phone calls whether to home or others.

> (a)     Victim 2 had testified that the mobile phone she was given had credit for both local and _international_ calls[^81], which would necessarily include calls to her family back in Bangladesh.

> (b)     DW4 Akter Shilpi (“Shilpi”) had testified that she _“sometimes call\[ed\] home_._”[^82]_ Shilpi disagreed with the suggestion that the performing artistes were only allowed to communicate with their families for only half an hour every Sunday - she testified: _“anyone could speak at any time to their family.”_[^83] She testified that if she did not have balance on her phone to make a call, she used to borrow the phones of other performing artistes to do so.[^84]

> (c)     Rane had testified that she had sought the assistance of customers to top up her phone credit balance[^85] - clearly to allow her to make personal calls. There is no reason why she would seek customers’ assistance to top up her credit balance if it was for the purpose of work (i.e. making calls to customers as alleged) - she could have requested that the Accused or Balan do so.

51     Further, in relation to the submission at \[49(c)\], it could not be said that the Victims were prohibited from telling customers of their plight. In this regard, the testimonies of Victim 1 and the performing artistes should be considered.

> (a)     Victim 1 had testified that she spoke to certain customers whom she was close to about her alleged situation at Taraana Club.[^86] Despite her testimony which could have corroborated the Prosecution’s case, _no_ such customers were called as witnesses to testify. This was surprising. This therefore casts doubt as to whether Victim 1’s testimony in this respect can be accepted as true, and whether the reason why she did not raise any complaints was because she was not harboured by means of abuse of power.

> (b)     Both Rane and Shilpi who were performing artistes at Taraana Club testified that they had sought customers’ assistance on personal matters such as remitting monies to Bangladesh on their behalf.[^87] It is crucial to appreciate that these requests for assistance were made _without_ the Accused’s knowledge. As these requests for assistance were not one-off but were repeated, the performing artistes clearly reposed a degree of trust in these customers they sought assistance from.

> (c)     In my judgment, if it was indeed true that the Victims were subjected to a condition to work which they could not change or escape from, or were harboured by means of abuse of power, the customers of the Company provided an avenue for the Victims to reach out for assistance and to raise complaints. However, there were either no such complaints raised, or no customers called as witnesses to testify that the Victims had raised complaints. This was equally puzzling.

52     Accordingly, the evidence before the Court casts serious doubt on whether the Victims had their freedom of communication curtailed.

#### Alleged financial demands in the event of premature termination of employment

53     Thirdly, according to the Prosecution, the Accused told the Victims that if they wanted to end their employment before their 6-month employment period, they would have to pay back to the Accused monies amounting to approximately $3,000, and if they were unable to do so, they would have to continue to be employed by the Company.[^88]

54     However, the Prosecution’s submission is inconsistent with the evidence before the Court. In respect of 10 performing artistes listed in Exhibit D29 who appear to have prematurely terminated their employment, the Accused had testified that no financial demands or monies were requested from them.[^89]

55     It is important to observe that two of the former performing artistes referred to in Exhibit D29 who prematurely terminated their employment (Akter Babna and Riya Roksana Akter) had done so during periods which corresponded with the time that Victim 2 was employed by the Company. Significantly, Victim 2 had also crucially _admitted_ during cross-examination that she was aware that Akter Babna (who she agreed was working with her and also residing with her while she was working in Singapore) did _not_ have to pay 200,000 takas (approximately S$3,000) to prematurely terminate her employment.[^90] Accordingly, the Accused’s testimony appears to be corroborated by the above evidence.[^91]

56     The Accused testified that the only time the performing artistes had to pay a certain amount back to her was if they left the Company within a month of their arrival in Singapore.[^92] Even then, the Accused had not demanded such sums from any performing artiste.[^93] Again, in this regard, Victim 2’s testimony appears to corroborate that of the Accused – during cross-examination, Victim 2 testified that there was no reason why Akter Babna had to pay 200,000 takas when her employment was prematurely terminated because _“she has worked for 3 months”_, instead of one month.[^94]

57     Further, the testimonies of the following former performing artistes also provided corroboration of the Accused’s testimony:

> (a)     Shilpi, a performing artiste who was employed by the Company in 2014, testified that she was aware of two performing artistes leaving before the six month period was up, and that the girls did _not_ have to pay any monies for prematurely terminating their employment.[^95]

> (b)     Rane testified that the only requirement to make payment when there was premature termination was if a performing artiste worked less than a month.[^96] If a performing artiste worked more than a month, no monies had to be paid for prematurely terminating before the six month period was completed.[^97]

#### Alleged confiscation of passports

58     Fourthly, the Prosecution submitted that the Accused and Balan abused their power over the Victims by illegally taking their passports away and withholding them without their consent during their employment.[^98] According to the Prosecution, this was a sure-fire way to ensure that the Victims could not leave Singapore even if they wanted to.[^99]

59     However, I found that the Victims handed their passports _voluntarily_ to the Accused, with the expectation that such possession was for the purposes of safekeeping, _as well as_, for necessary applications being made on their behalf – such applications relating to their employment in Singapore.[^100] Victim 1 testified that the Accused told her that the possession of her passport was for the purposes of safekeeping.[^101] Therefore, Victim 1 was clearly aware of the purpose of the Accused’s possession of her passport.

60     Further, if the purpose of the Accused’s retention of the Victims’ passports was to prevent them from leaving Singapore or from seeking help, it is surprising that the Accused did _not_ also ask to retain the work permits of the Victims. The work permits would allow the Victims to establish their legal status in Singapore and to seek help, including having MOM or the authorities assist to investigate any alleged exploitation or abuse and if necessary, help the Victims to be repatriated from Singapore.

#### Alleged requirement by the Accused for the performing artistes to purchase expensive lehengas from her

61     Fifthly, the Prosecution submitted that since the Accused made the performing artistes wear lehenga when performing at Taraana Club, the Accused also made the performing artistes purchase lehengas only from her at an exorbitant price of $200 each.[^102] The Prosecution suggested that the Accused ran a side business of selling lehengas to a captive and ignorant market and used that as a means to impose additional financial demands on the victims such that they had to continue working for her.[^103] The Victims had testified that they were _required_ to buy lehengas from the Accused and had no choice but to do so.[^104] Victim 1 had also testified that the Accused told her she could not wear old lehengas as there would be returning customers going to Taraana Club.[^105]

62     However, the evidence before the Court was inconsistent with the Prosecution’s submission. During cross-examination, Victim 1 agreed that she would exchange lehengas with other performing artistes or sell lehengas to each other.[^106] In my judgment, it appears inconsistent that the Accused would allow the performing artistes to exchange or sell the lehengas to one another, if the Accused _required_ them to buy new lehengas from her and prevented the performing artistes from wearing old lehengas.

63     Further, I accepted the evidence that there was a performing artiste, one Meena Rani (Exhibit D17), who did not purchase any lehengas from the Accused because she had brought her own lehengas to Singapore.[^107]

64     The reasonable conclusion to be drawn is that the performing artistes were not _required_ to buy the lehengas from the Accused.

#### Alleged creation of culture of fear and compliance

65     Finally, the Prosecution submitted that the Accused created a culture of fear and compliance including subjecting the Victims to restrictions on food, daily strip searches, as well as physical and verbal abuse.[^108]

66     However, the following contemporaneous exhibits illustrate the _fond relationship_ between the Victims and the Accused and Balan. In my judgment, it was not logical that the Victims would continue to act very fondly with the Accused and Balan, if it was true that they were subjected to daily strip searches as well as physical and verbal abuse. The following evidence was therefore clearly inconsistent with the Prosecution’s case:

> (a)     Exhibit D44 was a video where the performing artistes including the Victims addressed Balan as _“Jaanu”_, which loosely translated means ‘darling.’ Exhibit D44 also illustrated Victim 1 reaching out to Balan and kissing him on the cheek.[^109] Exhibit D44 clearly paints an affectionate, fond and friendly relationship between the performing artistes and Balan. This video was taken on 6 October 2015, just _one day_ before MOM visited the Accommodation on 7 October 2015.

> (b)     Exhibits D10 and D11 showed Victim 1 and Accused in selfie photographs. Similarly, Exhibit D26 shows Victim 1, Victim 2 and the Accused together in a ‘selfie’ photograph. These exhibits were captured on 28 November 2015. Exhibit D24 also captures a group photo involving the Accused and Victim 2. This exhibit was likely taken on 19 August 2015.

> (c)     Victim 1 admitted that she had gone shopping with the Accused in Orchard, and the Accused had bought her a perfume from a store called Zara.[^110] The question is _why_ the Accused would have brought Victim 1 shopping, if she was indeed exploiting Victim 1. This would be almost perverse conduct on the part of the Accused.

> (d)     Exhibit D21 illustrates Victim 2 and Balan cutting a cake together, Victim 2 blowing the candle, and Victim 2 smiling and appeared to want to feed Balan with a cake. These photos in D21 were captured on 25 October 2015. These photos illustrated Victim 2’s birthday being celebrated. I did not find it logical or credible that the Accused and Balan would on the one hand celebrate Victim 2’s birthday, if on the other hand, they were also deliberately abusing their power and exploiting her.

> (e)     Switi had testified that the Accused was _“like a family member, just like a mother”_ to her.[^111] Ana, who resided at the Accommodation, had testified that she observed the Accused and the Victims to be _“like friends, like a good friend_._”_[^112]

> (f)     There were also photographs illustrating the fond and friendly relationship between the Accused and other performing artistes (aside from the Victims) (Exhibit D23).

67     Further, the Prosecution sought to show that the Accused and Balan had restricted the amount of food that the Victims had daily.[^113] Victim 1 testified that she felt very bad about not having enough food, that she “_had to drink more water to appraise \[curb\] her hunger_”, and that she “_use\[d\] to feel sad_” as she was “_working for food_”.[^114] Victim 2 testified that when she was hungry, she would _“tell the customer to bring chocolate\[s\] for \[her\]”_ at Taraana Club and she _“used to share \[it\] with the other girls_.”[^115] Victim 2 also testified that there were two incidents where a performing artiste was slapped for taking and consuming a chicken wing from a customer.[^116] During cross-examination, Victim 1 had also suggested that she had lost weight as a result of the alleged abuses.[^117]

68     However, the Prosecution’s case was again inconsistent with the following evidence:

> (a)     Victim 2 testified that there were two meals provided a day - one in the morning and one in the afternoon.[^118] Victim 2 also testified that Balan had bought food to the Accommodation for the performing artistes, including biryani, various types of Indian food, ice cream and chocolates.[^119] Victim 2 testified that there had been a number of occasions when her colleagues and her consumed KFC.[^120] She also testified that she had been brought to three restaurants.[^121]

> (b)     It was not in dispute that Ana was hired as a helper by Balan, and her tasks include cooking for the performing artistes. What was disputed was the amount of food cooked by Ana. I found that there was doubt as to whether the amount of food provided to the Victims was restricted. It must be borne in mind that the Victims’ job was physically demanding - i.e. to dance nightly for long hours at Taraana Club. As the other performing artistes testified, it is not logical that they would continue to be able to dance _daily_ if they were not provided sufficient food.

> (c)     Contemporaneous photographs (Exhibits D12, D15 and D20) showed that Victim 1 and the performing artistes were brought to consume food outside of the Accommodation - at restaurants and at a picnic. These photos were captured during the period of both PHTA charges - i.e. on 3 January 2016[^122] and 11 August 2015[^123] respectively.

69     I considered the Prosecution’s submissions that there was a commercial reason for these photographs being taken of the performing artistes. According to the Prosecution, photographs of dancers in various social settings, both inside Taraana Club and outside the Club were used as promotional material on Taraana Club’s Facebook page.[^124] The Prosecution suggested that there was no reason why photographs taken in 2015 of the Victims would not have been used in the same manner. However, a search on Taraana Club’s Facebook page reveals that none of the photographs and the video identified in \[66\] had been uploaded on the homepage. Further, most if not all of these photographs were of a very revealing nature or showed personal celebratory occasions. These were not the kind of photographs normally associated with promotional materials on the Facebook homepage of a reputable dance club. Accordingly, I was unable to accept these photographs admitted into evidence functioned purely as promotional material. I therefore rejected the Prosecution’s submission.

#### Lack of objective contemporaneous evidence adduced by Prosecution

70     For completeness, I should add that I found an almost total lack of objective, contemporaneous evidence adduced by the Prosecution in support of its case. This was unfortunate. It could otherwise have assisted the court considerably in arriving at its findings. Further, there were only _three Prosecution witnesses_, which essentially made up the entire Prosecution case.

> (a)     Two of these three witnesses were the Victims, whom I had earlier found to be lacking in credibility.

> (b)     The other witness was IO Elwin, whose evidence was mostly formal. Notably, I observed that IO Elwin actually gave evidence which tended to corroborate the Defence’s case - as I will address later.[^125]

71     The Prosecution even relied on MOM statements of a number of the Defence witnesses. However, as highlighted earlier, I did not place much weight on these statements which were in any case, challenged by the Defence.

72     The paucity of credible and objective evidence in general, was distinctly troubling. Here, it is apposite to refer to _Jagatheesan v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 45</span>, which was followed by the Court of Appeal in _GCK_. The High Court held that reasonable doubt might arise from the _lack of evidence submitted_, if such evidence is necessary to support the Prosecution’s theory of guilt, at \[61\]:

> “To summarise, the Prosecution bears the burden of proving its case beyond reasonable doubt. While this does not mean that the Prosecution has to dispel all conceivable doubts, the doctrine mandates that, at the very least, those doubts for which there is a reason that is, in turn, relatable and supported by the evidence presented, must be excluded. **Reasonable doubt might also arise by virtue of the lack of evidence submitted, when such evidence is necessary to support the Prosecution’s theory of guilt.”**

> \[Emphasis added\]

73     As aptly encapsulated by the Court of Appeal in _GCK_, in ascertaining whether a reasonable doubt has arisen on the totality of the evidence, the Court ascertains whether a reasonable doubt has arisen from the _state of evidence at the close of the trial_, at \[143\] to \[145\]:

> “We turn to the second way in which **a reasonable doubt may arise**, which is **upon an assessment of the totality of the evidence**…

> The totality of the evidence logically includes the Defence’s case (both as a matter of the assertions put forth by the accused person, and the evidence he has adduced). The evaluative task here is not just internal to the Prosecution’s case, but rather, also comparative in nature…

> Conversely, what the Defence needs to do to bring the Prosecution’s case below the requisite threshold is to point to such evidence that is capable of generating a reasonable doubt: see Pinsler at para 12.009. If the Prosecution fails to rebut such evidence, it will necessarily fail in its overall burden of proving the charge against the accused person beyond a reasonable doubt. We would add that such evidence need not necessarily be raised (in the sense of being asserted, or being made the subject of submissions) by the Defence in order for it to give rise to a reasonable doubt. **What matters is that a reasonable doubt arises (in whatever form) from the state of the evidence at the close of the trial.”**

> \[Emphasis added\]

## Issue 4: Whether the Accused’s harbouring of the Victims was for the purposes of exploitation, i.e. _servitude_

74     Next, I considered the third element to be established under a PHTA charge - whether the Victims were harboured for the purpose of exploitation, to wit_, servitude_, as set out in the PHTA charges. “Servitude” is defined in section 2 of the PHTA to mean, in relation to an individual, any condition or obligation, not authorised by any written law, to work or render services from which the individual _cannot escape_ or which the individual is _not free to change._

### Meaning of “escape”

75     At the outset, I address the meaning of “escape” in the definition of servitude under section 2 of the PHTA. Parties had submitted extensively on this issue during the course of trial. I considered that a proper understanding of the meaning of “escape” would allow for a better appreciation of my findings in the subsequent parts of this decision.

76     In essence, both the Prosecution and Defence did not dispute that _physical escape_ was also included within the scope of “escape.” The dispute was whether “escape” should be extended beyond physical escape to cover non-physical escape (i.e. the victim’s ability to end the condition or obligation to work or render services).

#### Prosecution’s submissions

77     The Prosecution submitted that “escape” is not limited to physical escape in the sense of a victim running away, and should extend to non-physical escape - i.e. covering situations where the victim is able to freely end his or her condition or obligation to work.[^126] According to the Prosecution, limiting the definition of “escape” to physical escape:

> (a)     Ignores the textual context of the term, which refers to “any condition or obligation”, opposed to physical restraints or a physical place of detention[^127];

> (b)     Would be inconsistent with what Parliament intended as it penalises a successful escapee - the very fact of escape would absolve the accused person of holding the victims in servitude[^128]; and

> (c)     Would set a high standard for servitude to be established, which practically means that there would be no cases of servitude in Singapore.[^129]

78     The Prosecution submitted that interpreting the term “escape” as extending to non-physical escape would accord with Parliament’s intention for the PHTA to be aligned with international benchmarks, and to have regard to the local context.[^130] The Prosecution cited the following extracts from the Second Reading of the Prevention of Human Trafficking Bill (“PHT Bill”) as stated by Mr Christopher De Souza[^131]:

> “The objectives of the Prevention of Human Trafficking Bill before Parliament today are fourfold…Lastly, **the Bill will bring Singapore closer in line with international standards**, and uplift efforts to combat TIP in Singapore and the surrounding region.

> …

> In developing this Bill, **we have, indeed, benchmarked ourselves to international standards and norms, especially the UN TIP Protocol**.”

> …

> Key findings during the public consultations were considered carefully. For example, it was raised during the public consultation that **Singapore’s definition of key TIP terms should be closely aligned with international benchmarks and standards**, **but should also be adapted to suit the local context**.

> …

> Nevertheless, I must stress that **we have been mindful to ensure that all terminology and measures we have adopted internationally work well with our existing frameworks and laws**. We want to ensure our measures are enforceable and pragmatic.”

> \[Emphasis added\]

79     The Prosecution had also highlighted two aspects with regard to the local context:

> (a)     First, a sizeable portion of Singapore’s workforce are legal foreign workers.[^132] The fact that they are legally in Singapore does not exclude the possibility that they may be trafficked. The Prosecution indicated that victims of human trafficking often enter Singapore willingly because of their financial motivation to work here, having come from neighbouring countries with poor economic conditions.[^133] Such victims are not forcefully smuggled into Singapore.[^134] The Prosecution cited the speech by Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for Manpower, during the Second Reading of the PHT Bill[^135]:

>> “In spite of the presence of a large foreign work permit holder population in Singapore, based on the number of cases we have come across over the years, we have good reason to believe that TIP is not an endemic problem here…

>> Foreign workers in Singapore are largely treated in accordance with the law by their employers…

>> That said, from time to time, we do come across cases where workers are denied their rights or abused.”

> (b)     Second, the Prosecution submitted that given Singapore’s effective law enforcement it is unlikely that human trafficking offenders would rely upon egregious acts of violence or physical captivity.[^136]

80     As Parliament had referred to the UNODC Model Law in formulating the definitions in PHTA[^137], the Prosecution cited the commentary to the definition of “servitude” in the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime Model Law (“UNODC Model Law”), as set out below:

> “Servitude is prohibited by, among other instruments, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966). Neither of these international instruments contains an explicit definition of servitude. The definition given is based on an interpretation of the Universal Declaration and the Covenant listed.

> In its 2005 judgement in the case of Siliadin v. France the European Court of Human Rights defined servitude as:

> “An obligation to provide one’s services that is imposed by the use of coercion, and is to be linked to the concept of slavery.”

> (ECHR, 26 July 2005, No. 73316/01)

> An example of a criminal law definition of servitude is:

> “Servitude means a condition of dependency in which the labor or services of a person are provided or obtained by threats of serious harm to that person or another person, or through any scheme, plan or pattern intended to cause the person to believe that, if the person did not perform such labor or services, that person or another person would suffer serious harm.”

> (Source: US State Department Model Law to Combat Trafficking in Persons)”

81     According to the Prosecution, restricting “escape” to physical escape renders the existence of coercion and threats of serious harm (identified in the above UNODC Model Law definition) meaningless in a case of alleged human trafficking. Even in the presence of coercion and threats of serious harm, there would be no servitude if the victim could run away or report to the authorities. The Prosecution submitted that interpreting “escape” as extending to non-physical escape would correctly recognise that coercion and threats of serious harm continue to play a role in cases of human trafficking.[^138]

#### Defence’s submissions

82     On the other hand, the Defence submitted that “escape” refers to the act of physical escape, and not a situation where the victim merely contemplates being able to freely end his state of detention.[^139]

83     The Defence highlighted that if the phrase “cannot escape” means that the victim cannot freely terminate the condition or obligation (as the Prosecution submitted), the phrase “not free to change” would be rendered otiose.[^140] According to the Defence, the phrase “not free to change” should be interpreted as including _both_ a termination and an alteration of the condition or obligation.[^141] The Defence also submitted that if Parliament intended for “cannot escape” to mean a situation where a victim is unable to terminate the condition or obligation, it would have simply said so.[^142]

84     Further, the Defence also argued that the Prosecution’s position would be inconsistent with the references to “escape” in sections 11 and 14 of the PHTA - both of which clearly contemplate physical escape.[^143]

85     The Defence also submitted that a high threshold exists before a case can be classified as human trafficking.[^144] According to the Defence, it is for this reason that “servitude”, “slavery” and “forced labour” were classed together in the PHTA. The Defence therefore submitted that “servitude” must be interpreted with reference to “slavery” and “forced labour.”[^145] In support of its submission, the Defence referred to the following materials:

> (a)     In the UNODC Model Law, in defining “servitude”, reference is made to the 2005 judgment of _Siliadin v France_ (ECHR, 26 July 2005, 73316/01) (“_Siliadin”_), where the European Court of Human Rights defined servitude as: _“An obligation to provide one’s services that is imposed by the use of coercion, and is to be_ **_linked to the concept of slavery_**_.”[^146]_

> (b)     In _Regina v K(S)_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] QB 82</span> (_“R v K”_), the Court set out the distinction between the terms “slavery”, “servitude” and “forced labour”. According to the Court, at \[39\]:

>> **“\[the elements of slavery, servitude and forced labour\] form a hierarchy of denial of personal autonomy.** The essence of the concept of “slavery” is treating someone as belonging to oneself, by exercising some power over that person as one might over an animal or an object: see para 122 of the court’s judgment in Siliadin’s case. **The essence of the concept of “servitude” is one person’s obligation to provide services to another, an obligation imposed by the use of coercion**: paras 123 and 124 of the court’s judgment in Siliadin’s case. The essence of the concept of “forced or compulsory labour” is work exacted under the menace of a penalty and performed against the will of the person concerned, a concept which brought to mind the idea of either physical or mental constraint, the essential character of the work or service involved being work or service for which the person had not offered himself voluntarily: see para 117 of the court’s judgment in Siliadin’s case.

>> **These concepts are not necessarily mutually exclusive. A person can at the same time be subjected to “slavery or servitude” and to “forced or compulsory labour”.** The common denominator is that the victim is subject to a degree of enforced control.”

>> \[Emphasis added\]

#### Findings on meaning of “escape”

86     Having considered parties’ submissions, the PHTA and Parliamentary debates on the PHT Bill, I agreed with the Prosecution that the term “escape” refers to physical escape _as well as_ non-physical escape - i.e. “escape” must be broad enough to cover situations where: (a) a victim cannot physically escape or run away from the obligation to work or render services; as well as (b) where a victim cannot be free from an obligation to work or render services. In reaching this conclusion, I was mindful of the following:

> (a)     The above interpretation would be consistent with Parliament’s intention. In two illustrations cited by Mr Christopher De Souza during the Second Reading of the PHT Bill[^147], the term “escape” was referred to. It is clear from these illustrations that “escape” connotes not merely physical escape but also the ability of the victim to be free from any condition or obligation to work or render services that the victim was subjected to during the period of the offence:

>> “The first is a story of a lady who was working as a chef in a country in the region. She was offered a job to work as a chef in Singapore. She considered her options carefully and found that the potential earnings that she could make from taking up the offer far exceeded what she was then earning in her home country. So, she left her child behind and came to Singapore in the hope of earning more money to support her family back home.

>> Upon arrival in Singapore, she was told that she was in debt to the man who had arranged her entry into Singapore and that she would have to work as a prostitute and sexually service as many men as would be necessary for her to repay her debt. She refused to work the first day, she refused to work the second day and was adamant that she would not become a sex worker, and good for her. She said she was physically beaten up on the third day as a sex worker to pay back what she owed. **Soon after, she found an opportunity to escape and sought help. She is currently residing safely in a shelter and away from her environment of harm.**

>> The second story is one of a lady who was destitute and was told she could earn a sizeable amount of money by coming to Singapore. In her desperation to earn money to support her family, she agreed to the offer and left her home town. Upon her arrival, she was similarly told to prostitute herself to make a living and to repay her debt. She was told to work on a daily basis from 9.00 am to midnight – and all of us in this House can agree that this is extremely exploitative by any measure. **After three days, while her captors were distracted, she saw an opportunity to escape and she took it. She is now recovering safely in a shelter and receiving counselling support.**

>> **These two stories encapsulate what this Bill is all about**…”

>> \[Emphasis added\]

> (b)     Such an interpretation would also be consistent with the PHTA’s ethos to “_speak up for the voiceless and helpless by sending as strong a signal as we can against these serious crimes_”, “_to protect the most vulnerable of the vulnerable_” and “_to prevent \[trafficking in persons\] from taking root in our community_.”[^148]

> (c)     Further, the above interpretation would be consistent with international standards. I observed that both _Siliadin_ (which was specifically referred to in the UNODC Model Law) and _R v K_ refer to “servitude” being one person’s obligation to provide services to another, an obligation imposed by the use of coercion_._[^149] This means that the essence of servitude is whether an individual is able to _free himself or herself from the condition or obligation to work or render services_. Accordingly, an interpretation of “escape” which includes non-physical escape would be consistent with these cases.

87     Under this interpretation, I emphasise that whether or not a victim can physically escape remains a relevant factor in determining whether servitude can be established. In my view, I noted that this would not perversely penalise successful escapees. The mere fact that a victim has successfully escaped does not prevent a finding of servitude. It must be appreciated that in all cases under s 3 of the PHTA, the Court would necessarily have regard to the totality of the evidence in ascertaining whether there was servitude:

> (a)     In cases where a victim physically escaped, the Court would consider for instance whether the victim had actual freedom and whether the accused person effectively had control over the victim.

> (b)     In cases where a victim did not escape despite there being opportunities to do so, the Court would have regard to the reasons why the victim did not escape.

88     I observed that the above interpretation of “escape” would not result in any internal inconsistencies with sections 11 and 14 of the PHTA which also refer to the term “escape”. I noted that the _context_ in which the term exists in these provisions must be appreciated. The term “escape” in the definition of “servitude” in s 2 of the PHTA must be read in the context of the obligation or condition to work or render services. In contrast, the term “escape” in ss 11 and 14 refer to the police powers of _arrest_ - i.e. clearly referring to situations of physical escape.

89     Further, I highlight that the above interpretation of the term “escape” is not inconsistent with Parliament’s intention to set a high threshold for offences of human trafficking since as stated by Mr Christopher De Souza MP “…_TIP is a serious offence carrying severe penalties, it is important for the thresholds to be appropriately high_.” In any case, I note that even if a condition or obligation is one which a victim cannot escape or change, an offence under s 3(1) of the PHTA is _not_ made out unless the other elements of “acts” and “means” are also established.[^150] These are all necessary and appropriately high thresholds for TIP cases.

90     With this background, I considered the following in ascertaining whether servitude was established:

> (a)     Failure to leave the Accommodation or raise any complaints despite clear opportunities;

> (b)     Offer of alternative accommodation not taken up;

> (c)     Victims were not isolated and had contact with third parties; and

> (d)     Victim 1 had not convincingly explained why she became employed at Taraana Club for the second time if the circumstances were similar as before.

### Failure to leave the Accommodation or raise any complaints despite clear opportunities

91     Firstly, I considered that the Victims had failed to leave the Accommodation or to raise any complaints to a third party despite there being clear opportunities to do so.

#### Visit by officers from MOM on 7 October 2015

92     The first such opportunity arose on 7 October 2015, when IO Elwin, together with a group of MOM officers and Bengali interpreters conducted an inspection at the Accommodation (“the 7 Oct 2015 MOM Visit”).[^151] During the visit, IO Elwin saw the Victims and four other performing artistes of Taraana Club.[^152]

93     During cross-examination, IO Elwin testified that all four of the performing artistes as well as the Victims he interviewed that day did _not_ want to leave the Accommodation, or expressed any complaints to him.[^153] I found that the visit (which fell within the period of _both_ PHTA charges) presented an opportunity for the victims to raise their complaints to the MOM officers, especially since they were accompanied by interpreters who communicated in Bengali[^154] - i.e. a language that the Victims communicated in. However, the Victims both testified that they did not do so.

94     In fact, IO Elwin himself testified that _“the threat was not… immediate”­_ – the “threat” being whether the girls could not leave the Accommodation or their employment with Taraana Club as and when they wanted.[^155] It bears mention that the visit was triggered by the police’s referral of the case to MOM, informing MOM that there was a girl that was being confined by the employer and was not allowed to leave the employment.[^156] This means that MOM would have been acute to any signs of abuses or servitude. Accordingly, there is a doubt as to whether the Victims were indeed subjected to a condition or obligation to work from which they could not escape or which they were not free to change.

95     For completeness, I noted that IO Elwin later testified that the performing artistes informed him that they could not simply leave the Accommodation as and when they wanted and had to be accompanied.[^157] However, I found such an explanation unconvincing. The 7 Oct 2015 MOM Visit was precisely an opportunity for the Victims to seek help if these were victims who genuinely could not escape or could not change the condition or obligation they were subjected to.

96     Further, Exhibit D44 in my judgment, is palpably inconsistent with the suggestion that the Victims were subjected to a state of servitude. It is significant and crucial to appreciate that Exhibit D44 was a video recording captured on 6 October 2015[^158] (i.e. just _one day_ before MOM visited the accommodation on 7 October 2015). Exhibit D44 illustrated the Victims as well as other performing artistes with Balan, where the former referred to Balan as _“Jaanu”_, a Hindi term meaning “Darling.” These acts clearly point towards an affectionate relationship between the Victims and Balan. In my judgment, Exhibit D44 therefore corroborates the Defence suggestion that the Victims had not been subjected to a condition or obligation from which they could not escape or change.

97     Against the backdrop of the environment depicted in Exhibit D44, the only reasonable explanation for the Victims not raising any complaints during the 7 Oct 2015 MOM Visit is that they were clearly not harboured for the purpose of servitude.

#### Further visits to MOM

98     The 7 Oct 2015 MOM Visit was not the only time the Victims met officers from MOM. There were at least two _other_ occasions where they met MOM officers and accordingly, had opportunities to seek assistance. The two occasions are as follows:

> (a)     Sometime before 1 March 2016, when the Victims went to MOM to obtain their Special Pass. They met either IO Elwin or Derrick.[^159]

> (b)     On 1 March 2016, the Victims again visited MOM (“1 Mar 2016 MOM Visit”). This time, they met IO Elwin again.[^160]

99     However, on all these occasions the Victims did not either express that they wished to leave the premises of the Accommodation, or sought for assistance from MOM, or expressed any complaints at all. [^161] This was baffling behaviour by the Victims. The Victims had met with MOM officers who were in fact investigating the case for the _second or third time_ on 1 March 2016 - almost five months since the first visit on 7 October 2015. It also bears mention that whilst the 7 Oct 2015 MOM Visit was at the Accommodation, the Victims met the MOM officers at MOM Headquarters itself on the subsequent occasions. Even if the Victims did not find that they could safely convey their plight to the MOM officers on 7 October 2015 because they felt scared or uncomfortable doing so at the Accommodation, the other occasions presented yet another golden opportunity for them to have sought help. Again, the Victims chose not to do so.

100    It was not until 2 March 2016 that there was a _“turn of event\[s\]”_, in the words of IO Elwin, when the statements of the performing artistes were recorded, that the Victims finally sought help from MOM.[^162]

#### Effect of not leaving Accommodation or raising complaints when the opportunities arose

101    In my judgment, the failure of the Victims not to leave the Accommodation or to raise complaints when the opportunity arose on several occasions casts serious doubt as to whether they were indeed subjected to a condition or obligation from which they could not escape or were not free to change. At trial, neither Victim 1 nor Victim 2 provided a convincing explanation as to why they had not complained or sought the assistance of the MOM officers when the opportunities arose.

102    For completeness, Victim 1 had testified that she had allegedly attempted to run away in 2013 when she first worked for the Company.[^163] She testified that during that incident, she went to MOM to complain that she had been _“beaten”_ by the Accused, but that MOM _“did not do anything”_, including not conducting investigations, and most surprisingly, even allowed Victim 1 to be employed again for the second time in 2015 by the _same employer -_ the Company.[^164] First, I note that this was an unsubstantiated account of at the very least, MOM inaction. Second, it was tantamount to alleging MOM of being inept or worse, totally insensitive to at the very least, worker abuse or at its worst, a serious case of human trafficking. It is patently clear that this alleged attempt to run away, in particular noting that it was driven by the Accused’s own self-serving actions, was both fanciful and inherently improbable. It could not have been true on any reasonable analysis. I therefore rejected Victim 1’s account of her previous escape attempt as being nothing more than a creative and chimerical story.

103    In reaching my finding on this issue, I was acutely mindful that victims of human trafficking could be in a state of helplessness and unable to escape even when they are presented with opportunities to escape, or if they escape, they return to captivity.[^165] This happens when[^166]:

> “\[t\]raffickers systematically isolate their victims, creating a sense of disconnection from others…utilize verbal abuse and humiliation to impact their victims’ sense of self…\[and\] create an environment of fear through threats of harm to victims or their families. This chronic fear activation can lead to physiological changes that impair the ability of victims to mobilize the physical and psychological resources needed to escape.”

104    Further, there could be cases where power imbalance is so great that victims do not dare to ask for any changes in their work or living conditions or had opportunities to do so.[^167]

105    The totality of the evidence before the court however, manifestly demonstrated that this was patently not a case where the Victims were helpless, or where the power imbalance was demonstrably great. The Victims did not appear to be operating under an environment of fear, subjected to abuse and humiliation, or isolated from others. In particular, I have referred earlier to objective, contemporaneous evidence in the form of Exhibits D44, D10, D11 and D26, all vividly illustrating the fondness, high-spirited and merry relationship between the Victims and Balan and also between the Victims and the Accused. Evidence was also led that the Victims were not isolated (as will be addressed below). I found this credible, contemporaneous and compelling evidence to be inconsistent with the Prosecution’s case. It was also a huge disconnect which had not been satisfactorily explained by the Victims.

106    Further, it is important to appreciate that this was not a case where the Victims only had _one opportunity_ to raise complaints to MOM officers, and did not seize that one missed opportunity. On the contrary, there were _several opportunities_ for the Victims to raise their complaints to the MOM Officers who were right in front of them. Further, it is also reasonable and fair to assume that the MOM Officers would have reassured the Victims that there was nothing to be afraid of and that they would be safe. It is therefore puzzling why the Victims chose not to do so, until the very last occasion. When the totality of the evidence is considered, there is again doubt cast on the Prosecution’s case.

107    Nevertheless, the mere fact that a victim is able to physically escape is not the be all and end all - servitude can also be established if despite having opportunities to physically escape, a victim _cannot end or change_ the condition or obligation to work or to render services. However, even on this basis, the evidence suggested that the Victims _could have ended or changed_ the condition to work but chose not to. In this regard, Exhibit D29[^168] disclosed that there were _10_ former performing artistes of the Company who appear to have prematurely terminated their employment (i.e. who cancelled their Work Permits even _before_ the expiry of the Work Permit), and returned to their home country shortly after. The Accused had testified that no financial demands or monies were requested from these performing artistes for leaving earlier.[^169] Victim 2 had even _admitted_ during cross-examination that she was aware that there was a performing artiste who did _not_ have to pay 200,000 takas (approximately S$3,000) to prematurely terminate her employment.[^170] The testimonies of several former performing artistes also corroborated the Accused’s testimony.[^171] Accordingly, I find that the Victims could have ended or changed their condition or obligation to work had they chosen to do so.

### Offer of alternative accommodation initially not taken up by Victim 2

108    Secondly, sometime before March 2016, Victim 2 went to MOM to collect her Special Pass. During this visit, MOM had informed Victim 2 that if she was not happy with the Accommodation, MOM would provide her with alternative accommodation.[^172]

109    However, even though Victim 2 testified that she _“felt like \[she was\] in a jail”_ and that she was _“very scared”_, Victim 2 did _not_ take up the offer of alternative accommodation and opted instead to continue staying at the Accommodation.[^173] Victim 2 testified that she did not do so because the Accused had informed her that: (a) the _“living condition \[in hostels\] is not good”_, including showing her photographs; (b) she would have to pay for staying in the hostel, and in order to raise money to do so, she would have to go out with customers; and (c) the _“food is also not good.”_[^174]

110    In my judgment, the fact that Victim 2 did not take up the offer of alternative accommodation was significant. If Victim 2 was truly subjected to a condition or obligation from which she could not escape or could not change, and was now offered alternative accommodation which would precisely afford her the avenue to leave the Accommodation, it is curious why the hostel’s allegedly poor living conditions and food provided was Victim 2’s _immediate_ concern, as opposed to immediately seizing the opportunity to be housed elsewhere.[^175] I should also add that this was not a mere case of worker abuse or even a minor breach of labour laws or licensing conditions. This was a case which involved very serious allegations that Victim 2 was being harboured for the purposes of _exploitation_, i.e. _servitude_ by the Accused_._ Put simply, this was a case involving human trafficking. There was simply no logical or reasonable explanation that was proffered as to why Victim 2 would make a conscious choice to continue living under the _same conditions_ she had been subjected to, if the serious allegations against the Accused were indeed true.

### Victims were not isolated and had contact with third parties

111    Thirdly, I found that the Victims were not isolated and did have contact with third parties. It was the Prosecution’s case that the Accused and Balan effectively cut off the contact of the Victims with the outside world.[^176] The Prosecution submitted that even if the Victims knew where to seek help, their ability to do so would have been severely limited_._[^177] The Prosecution sought to show that:

> (a)     The movements of the Victims in public were tightly controlled[^178]. They could not leave the Accommodation without permission. They were monitored and accompanied on the rare occasions they were allowed to leave the Accommodation. Further, they were monitored when travelling by company transportation between the Accommodation and Taraana Club.

> (b)     The Accused monitored the Victims in the Accommodation and in Taraana Club through CCTV cameras.[^179] Victim 1 testified that the monitoring made her feel like a _“terrorist”_ or a _“criminal”._[^180]

> (c)     The freedom of communication of the Victims was curtailed.[^181] They had no access to their personal mobile phones.[^182] They had strictly limited opportunities to contact their families.[^183] They were prohibited from telling customers of their plight.[^184]

112    However, the evidence at trial painted a starkly different picture. The Victims were not isolated, _had_ contact with what the Prosecution terms the “outside world” and were able to seek help if they wanted to.

> (a)     The Victims had been brought to places where there were _large crowds_ and also other well-known and popular places where the Victims could likely find friendly persons who spoke the _same language_ as them (e.g. Mustafa Centre, Indian restaurants).[^185] In fact, the visit to Mustafa Centre was a _routine_ visit_._ It was not logical for the Accused and Balan to bring the Victims to these places where there was a heavy footfall and large crowds which could make it easier for them to leave and seek help, if the intent was to isolate the Victims. It simply made no sense and involved a high risk for the Accused and Balan to visit these places. To suggest therefore that these visits were not post-work group outings or normal outings for relaxation among work colleagues, but involved surveillance, control and restrictions on the freedom of movement of the Victims, was simply a tepid proposition. This was especially so if what the Accused and Balan were trying to achieve, was to prevent the Victims from seeking help and to isolate the Victims and the other performing artistes.

> (b)     The Victims also had contact with their families.

113    Notwithstanding the above examples, I note that I have also addressed the alleged restrictions and curtailment of the Victims’ freedom of movement in greater detail in an earlier part of this decision at \[42\] to \[48\].

### Victim 1 had not convincingly explained why she became employed at Taraana Club for the second time if the circumstances were similar as before

114    Finally, in relation to Victim 1, I also took into consideration that the relevant period of the charge C3 was not Victim 1’s first employment stint with Taraana Club - it was her _second_ (the first was from 16 April 2013, for a period of six months[^186]). Evidence was led that the circumstances at the Accommodation and at Taraana Club were not starkly different in 2013 and in 2015. For instance, Victim 1 herself alleged: (a) that she was not allowed outside the accommodation unaccompanied in both 2013 and 2015[^187]; (b) that the Accused took her hand phone both in 2013 and 2015[^188]; that the Accused told her if she wanted to return, she had to pay back her agent fees and advance monies, and that if she did not have monies to make such payment, she would have to work for three to four months for free.[^189]

115    I considered Victim 1’s explanation that she worked for the Company again in 2015 because she had no job, needed money to support her family and was told by the Accused that _“things have been changed.[^190]”_ However, I did not find her explanation convincing for two reasons:

> (a)     There was no reason given as to why she had returned all the way from Bangladesh to Singapore, to be employed by the same Company for a second time and doing the same job, knowing that there was a likelihood that she could have been subjected to the same allegedly oppressive conditions as her 2013 previous employment stint at the Company. Further, I noted also that Singapore was not the only country Victim 1 had previous employment experience in aside from Bangladesh. Victim 1 had experience working in _other_ countries such as Dubai and Malaysia, also as a performing artiste.[^191] Even if Taraana Club was the only place in Singapore she had previously been employed at, she could have also sought employment in these other countries or in other dance clubs in Singapore.

> (b)     Even if Victim 1 truly and honestly believed the Accused when she promised that things had changed in Taraana Club, what is more surprising is that when Victim 1 subsequently realised that nothing had changed, Victim 1 did _not_ raise any complaints.[^192] Her return to the Company to work in these circumstances was clearly more than illogical. It was simply incredulous and not believable.

116    The fact that Victim 1 became employed by the Company for the second time in 2015 is even more so surprising in light of Victim 1’s testimony that she had allegedly attempted to run away in 2013 when she first worked for the Company (which I had earlier in this decision found to be inherently improbable).[^193] Accordingly, I had grave doubts as to whether Victim 1 had truly been harboured for the purpose of servitude. More importantly, I had strong reservations as to whether she even could be considered as a credible witness, let alone a witness of truth.

### Conclusion on whether the Victims were harboured for the purpose of servitude

117    Having considered the above issues, I found that there was considerable doubt as to whether the Victims could not escape or change their condition or obligation to work. Accordingly, there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the Victims were harboured and exploited for the purpose of servitude.

## Issue 5: Whether the Passports Act charges are made out

### Elements of charge under s 47(5) of the Passport Act

118    The elements of a charge under s 47(5) of the Passports Act are as follows:

> (a)     A person has or retains possession or control in Singapore of a foreign travel document; and

> (b)     The person knows that the foreign travel document was not issued to him.

119    At the same time, there is a defence to the charge if the person had a reasonable excuse to have or retain possession or control of the foreign travel document under s 47(7) of the Passports Act.

### Submissions by parties and court’s findings under s 47(5) of the Passports Act

120    The Prosecution submitted that the Accused and Balan retained the Victims’ passports in their possession without their consent from the time they arrived in Singapore.[^194] On the other hand, the Defence disputed that the _Accused_ retained the passports of the Victims.[^195] It was the Defence’s position that the passports were held by the _Company_, at the Company’s office. [^196]

121    I found, as a fact, that:

> (a)     the Accused had retained the passports of the Victims. The Accused had asked for Victim 1’s passport when Victim 1 arrived at the Accommodation. Balan had asked for Victim 2’s passport when Victim 2 arrived at the Accommodation. Both Victim 1 and Victim 2 gave the Accused and Balan their passports. As manager and Director of Taraana Club respectively, the passports were kept at the Company’s office under the Accused’s or Balan’s instructions; and

> (b)     the Accused knew that the passports of the Victims was not issued to her.

### Whether the Accused had a reasonable excuse to retain the passports of the Victims

122    Next, I considered whether the Defence could rely on s 47(7) of the Passports Act for each of the Passports Act charges to show that the Accused had a reasonable excuse to retain the passports of the Victims.

123    The leading case of _Ma Wenjie_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 137</span> (_“Ma Wenjie”_) establishes that whether or not an excuse is reasonable has to be determined in light of the particular facts and circumstances of the individual case, from the perspective of a _reasonable person in the accused’s shoes_ at the relevant time of the offence: at \[31\]. It is also clear that the Defence bore the burden to show on a balance of probabilities, that the Accused had a reasonable excuse for retaining the Victims’ passports: at \[35\].

124    The Defence submitted that the passports of the Victims were kept in the Company’s office for the following purposes: safekeeping to mitigate against the passports being misplaced, and for the making of any necessary applications. [^197]

125    On the other hand, the Prosecution submitted that that the Accused had no reasonable excuse to retain the Victims’ passports because such retention was without the consent of the Victims and without any explanation, in circumstances where the Victims were perfectly capable of keeping their passports themselves.[^198]

#### Holding passport as a custodian could amount to reasonable excuse

126    The High Court in _Ma Wenjie_ cited the decision of _Ma Yuxiang_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 311</span> (_“Ma Yuxiang”_), where it was held that there could be a reasonable excuse for being in possession with someone else’s passport where an accused was retaining a passport on behalf of the passport holder with lawful authority: at \[29\] of _Ma Wenjie_. The High Court in _Ma Wenjie_ observed that there was reasonable excuse in _Ma Yuxiang_ because the accused possessed five PRC passports on the authority of the passport-holders for the purpose of applying for visas in Singapore.

127    I was also guided by the example cited in _Ma Yuxiang_ of the Bruneian decision of _Wong Ting Yong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1987\] 2 MLJ 753</span> (_“Wong Ting Yong”_) of a situation which could potentially amount to a reasonable excuse[^199]: _Ma Yuxiang_ at \[105\] and \[106\]_._ In _Wong Ting Yong_, the appellant was charged with, without lawful authority, the possession of five passports belonging to two Filipinos and 3 Thais. The appellate court of Brunei held that the passports were handed over by the passport holders _voluntarily_ in order to extend their visitors’ passes and working permits for them to remain lawfully to work. The appellant’s authority to retain the passports was never revoked and he assumed the responsibilities as custodian of the passports for and on behalf of the passports. Importantly, even though the passports of two of the passport holders were handed to the accused for him to obtain visit passes and work permits _which he failed to acquire_, he _continued to hold on to those passports_ until they were seized by the authorities. Neither passport holder had asked the accused for the return of her passport.

128    On the facts of _Wong Ting Yong_, the Court observed that there was no evidence that the appellant held onto the passports for an unlawful purpose, and that merely continuing to hold the passports did not evidence any possession by the accused for an unlawful purpose. In reaching its decision, the Court considered it relevant that there was no request for the return of a passport.

129    Applying _Wong Ting Yong_, the retaining of passports for safekeeping could amount to a reasonable excuse, provided that the passports were given voluntarily for the purposes of applications which would allow the Victims to remain in Singapore for work, and such authority was never revoked by the Victims.

130    In view of the above, I find that:

> (a)     The Victims had handed their passports _voluntarily_ to the Accused, with the expectation that such possession was for the purposes of safekeeping, _as well as_, for applications being made on their behalf – such applications relating to their employment in Singapore.[^200] This included work permit applications and medical examinations conducted when the Victims arrived in Singapore. The Accused’s testimony that the Victims’ passports were held for the purposes of safekeeping was corroborated by Victim 1’s own testimony during cross-examination:

>> (i)       Victim 1 testified that the Accused told her that she needed the passport “_for safe keeping_.”[^201]

>> (ii)       Victim 1 also testified and that the Accused informed her that _“\[k\]eeping \[the passport\] with \[the Accused\] or \[Victim 1\] is the same thing, but if it’s with \[the Accused\] it is more safe…_”[^202]

> (b)     The Accused retained possession of the passports as a custodian – she held the passports for and on behalf of the Victims. It bears mention that the Victims’ passports were kept in the Company’s office, and not in the Accused’s personal possession.

> (c)     The Victims never requested for their passports be returned to them. Accordingly, the Accused’s continued retention of the passports could not be said to be without reasonable excuse.

> (d)     Further, there was no evidence that the Accused held onto the Victims’ passports for an unlawful purpose.

131    In reaching my findings, I also noted the observation in _Ma Yuxiang_ that the passport offences in the Passport Act is “_really intended to prevent terrorists from slipping in and out of Singapore freely with stolen or forged passports as well as to deter syndicates from selling lost or stolen Singapore and foreign passports_”, and that s 47 of the Passports Act is targeted at “_address\[ing\] the problems relating to misuse, forgery and tampering of foreign travel documents like passports_”: _Ma Yuxiang_ at \[142\].

132    In my judgment, the present case does not seem to fall within the purpose as intended by Parliament. Parliament had envisaged a situation where persons may have a _bona fide_ need to temporarily hand over their passports to other persons like travel agents or visa couriers _to facilitate their travel_ - so long as the passports are not being abused or used as a form of security or surety while in transit or otherwise: _Ma Yuxiang_ at \[143\]. The Accused in the present case had in fact held onto the Victims’ passports to facilitate applications relating to their employment, and to safe keep the passports, _without_ abusing or using the passports as a form of security or surety. As was aptly noted in _Ma Yuxiang_, the scope for “reasonable excuse” cannot be so narrow until it becomes impractical or absurd: _Ma Yuxiang_ at \[143\].

133    Accordingly, I found that there was a reasonable excuse for the Accused to have retained the passports of the Victims.

## Whether the charges have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt

134    The Court of Appeal in _GCK_ established that a reasonable doubt may arise upon an assessment of the totality of the evidence: at \[135\]. This involves a holistic assessment of both the Prosecution’s and the Defence’s cases, and the interactions between the two: _GCK_ at \[135\]. Crucially, the Court of Appeal highlighted that the Defence can bring the Prosecution’s case below the requisite threshold by pointing to such evidence that is capable of generating a reasonable doubt: _GCK_ at \[145\]. If the Prosecution fails to rebut such evidence, it will necessarily fail in its overall burden of proving the charge beyond a reasonable doubt: _GCK_ at \[145\].

135    In relation to the PHTA charges, having considered the evidence in totality, I found that:

> (a)     There was a reasonable doubt as to whether the Victims could not escape or change the condition or obligation to work. Accordingly, there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the Victims were harboured for the purpose of _servitude_. I also considered that:

>> (i)       The Victims did not escape or try to leave the Accommodation or raise any complaints despite clear opportunities to do so. I also did not find any explanations they had offered as to why they had not done so, to be convincing. This was especially troubling in light of evidence showing that performing artistes _could_ prematurely terminate their employments without financial demands being sought from them.

>> (ii)       Victim 2 did not initially take up the offer of alternative accommodation offered by MOM. I did not find Victim 2’s explanation convincing.

>> (iii)       This was not Victim 1’s first time being employed by the Company, but her second occasion. She had not convincingly explained why she became employed by the same Company for the same job and for a second time, if the conditions were the same exploitative conditions as before and now even involved allegedly, the more serious offence of human trafficking involving servitude.

> (b)     There was also reasonable doubt as to whether the Victims were harboured by means of _abuse of power._ The Defence had adduced sufficient evidence to raise a reasonable doubt that the Victims were harboured by means of abuse of power.

136    In relation to the Passports Act charges, having considered the evidence in totality, I found that the Accused had a reasonable excuse to have retained the passports of the Victims.

137    Accordingly, in relation to all the proceeded charges, I am satisfied that the Prosecution has failed to prove its case against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt: see _GCK_ at \[145\].

138    In the circumstances, I acquitted the Accused of all the proceeded charges. The Accused is given a discharge amounting to an acquittal of all the four proceeded charges against her.
