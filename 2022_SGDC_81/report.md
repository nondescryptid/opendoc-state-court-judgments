Criminal Law – Offences – Hurt

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9037/2022/01.\]

14 April 2022

### District Judge Lim Wen Juin:

1       Following a trial I convicted the accused, a 64-year-old man who was not represented by counsel throughout the proceedings, on a single charge of voluntarily causing hurt punishable under s 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). I convicted him because I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that, on 26 September 2020 around 12.30pm in a Korean restaurant at HillV2 (“the Restaurant”), he grabbed and twisted the right arm of Ms Shin Jihye (“Ms Shin”) at or near the wrist knowing that he would likely cause bodily pain to her, and in doing so caused her to sustain an injury to her right triangular fibrocartilage complex (“TFCC”), which is a structure comprising ligaments and cartilage located near the right wrist.

2       Having convicted him on the charge I imposed a sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment. I also ordered that he pay a sum of $1,418.80 by way of compensation to Ms Shin pursuant to s 359 of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010, that sum being the total amount of medical expenses Ms Shin incurred in connection with her right TFCC injury. The accused has lodged an appeal against conviction and sentence and so I set out in writing my reasons for convicting him and for imposing the sentence.

## The uncontroversial facts

3       I start by describing the basic uncontroversial facts that emerged from the evidence. On 26 September 2020, the accused and several of his family members went to the Restaurant for lunch. Ms Shin was the manager – also known as the “lady boss” – of the Restaurant.

4       The family members accompanying the accused comprised his wife Ms Wang Lin Ke as well as their daughter Ms Fei Xiaorui (“Ms Fei”) and her husband and their two daughters. Given the size of the group they were assigned separate tables in the Restaurant. The accused, Ms Wang Lin Ke and one of Ms Fei’s daughters sat in a small room separate from the main dining area, while Ms Fei, her husband and their other daughter sat in that main dining area. In the small room there was another table beside the one occupied by the accused. One of the diners at that other table was Mr Song Kwang Hoon (“Mr Song”).

5       Some unhappiness arose when the accused’s order was delivered to his table. The accused and Ms Wang Lin Ke thought that there was a significant and unacceptable discrepancy between what was delivered and what was depicted on the menu. In response to this unhappiness Ms Shin entered the small room. Following a verbal exchange Ms Shin began clearing the table of the order that had been delivered. The accused was holding a menu and he tried to take a photograph of it using his mobile phone. Ms Shin did not want him to do so and attempted physically to take the menu from him. Moments later Ms Shin cried out and squatted while holding her right wrist with her left hand. The paramedics and police were called to the Restaurant. The first information report summarised the information conveyed to the authorities during the call in the following way: “ARGUMENTS WITH CUSTOMER TWIST HER ARM AND SCALDED HER ARM”. Thereafter Ms Shin was taken by an ambulance to the accident and emergency (“A&E”) department of Ng Teng Fong General Hospital (“NTFGH”).

6       At the NTFGH A&E department Dr Bey Shimin (“Dr Bey”) attended to Ms Shin around 2.50pm. According to a medical report dated 5 October 2020 (“the A&E Report”) Ms Shin informed Dr Bey that a customer had “grabbed her right wrist and forcibly supinated her right wrist”. She reported “some pain and mild swelling in the right wrist”. The A&E Report also recorded “some tenderness over her right ulnar styloid and distal ulna” and “pain on the extremes of flexion as well as on ulna and radial deviation”. An X-ray was taken of her right wrist. Ms Shin was discharged the same day “with a right below elbow slab cast and appropriate analgesia”.

7       Slightly more than a week later, on 5 October 2020, Ms Shin went to the Hand Surgery clinic at NTFGH. There she saw Dr Chin-Yi Janice Liao (“Dr Liao”), a hand specialist. A second X-ray was taken of her right wrist. On 13 October 2020 a CT scan was taken of her right wrist. Over the next few months Ms Shin saw Dr Liao on three further occasions. During this period she was treated for a right TFCC injury with occupational therapy sessions. By the time of her last recorded visit on 4 January 2021 “her symptoms had improved, and she was discharged with an open date for follow up”. Ms Shin’s consultations with and treatment at the NTFGH Hand Surgery clinic are described in a medical report dated 20 April 2021 (“the Specialist Report”).

## Overview of the parties’ positions and the evidence

8       According to the prosecution, the reason why Ms Shin cried out and squatted holding her right wrist was that the accused had grabbed and twisted her right arm and thereby caused injury to her right TFCC. The accused denied this. He characterised Ms Shin as the aggressor in the incident. His case was that she had “attacked” him as he tried to take photographs of the Restaurant’s menu with his mobile phone. He said that he had merely acted in self-defence by using his arm to block her attacks and had not meant to hurt her. He said, moreover, that if his act of blocking Ms Shin resulted in any physical contact between his and Ms Shin’s arm, that contact did not cause any injury to Ms Shin. He claimed that by crying out and squatting while holding her right wrist Ms Shin had in fact been feigning injury. He suggested that Ms Shin had had a pre-existing right wrist injury and that in attacking him she opportunistically sought to manufacture “points of contact” between her and him so that she could blame him for the injury and so “extort” and “blackmail” him.

9       There was no video footage of the incident. Hence the evidence before me comprised mainly the oral testimonies of eyewitnesses. The prosecution called Ms Shin as its first witness (she was designated PW1). Then it called three witnesses who testified that they had seen the incident. One of them was Mr Song (PW4). The other two were members of the Restaurant’s staff at the time of the incident, namely Ms Wang Ying (PW2) and Ms Som Swee Xuan (“Ms Som”, designated PW3).

10     In addition the prosecution called four medical doctors to the stand, including Dr Bey (PW5) and Dr Liao (PW8), both of whom had attended to Ms Shin. The other two doctors had never met Ms Shin and their only involvement in this case was that they had written the two medical reports from NTFGH that were in evidence before me: Dr Lim Zhe Yee Samuel (PW6) wrote the A&E Report by typing Dr Bey’s consultation notes into a “formal format”, and Dr Ada Ngo (PW7) wrote the Specialist Report based on Dr Liao’s contemporaneous clinical notes. Given the very limited involvement of these two doctors in this case I do not need to say anything more about their testimonies.

11     On the side of the defence, the accused took the stand (as DW1) to give evidence, and he also called Ms Wang Lin Ke (DW2) and Ms Fei (DW3) as witnesses. The accused did not call any medical doctors or put forward any medical evidence. This was so even though he had alluded in the course of the trial to having had discussions with a doctor from the National University Hospital – whom he knew only as “Dr Yung” – about this case and Ms Shin’s medical reports. He was given ample opportunity during the trial to call Dr Yung or any other doctor as a witness. Bearing in mind that he was unrepresented by counsel and might not be familiar with criminal procedure, I explained to him that he had the right to apply to me to issue process for compelling the attendance of a doctor to give evidence on his behalf, and that he would not have to pay the doctor’s costs for attending court, and that it was entirely up to him to decide whether or not to call any doctor as a witness, but if he decided not to do so it would mean that the medical evidence I could take into account would be confined to that which the doctors called by the prosecution had put forward. He decided not to call a doctor as a witness and so closed his case after Ms Fei had given her evidence.

12     I discuss the evidence given by the witnesses in more detail below but it might be useful at this juncture to describe in broad outline the testimonies of the non-medical witnesses. Ms Shin testified that the accused grabbed her right palm and twisted. Ms Wang Ying and Ms Som both testified that they saw the accused grab Ms Shin’s arm, but there were differences in their accounts as to the exact part of her arm that he grabbed: Ms Wang Ying said that he grabbed Ms Shin at the wrist, while Ms Som said that he grabbed Ms Shin’s forearm below the wrist away from the hand. Ms Som testified that the accused twisted Ms Shin’s arm after grabbing it, whereas Ms Wang Ying said that she could not see if he had used force after grabbing Ms Shin’s palm, but she did see that Ms Shin’s palm was bent downwards and her hand had started to swell. As for Mr Song, he testified that he saw the accused push Ms Shin’s hand “very hard” and that he did not recall whether the accused had grabbed or held on to Ms Shin’s arm because the incident had occurred “all of a sudden”.

13     Against this, the accused, Ms Wang Lin Ke and Ms Fei testified that there had been no grabbing and twisting of Ms Shin’s arm. Ms Fei said that she had seen the incident even though she had been assigned a separate table in the main dining area, and she explained that this was because she had got up and gone to the small room where the incident occurred after having heard the accused speaking to a waitress. The evidence of the accused, Ms Wang Lin Ke and Ms Fei was largely consistent. They agreed that Ms Shin had reached out to try to stop the accused from taking photographs of the Restaurant’s menu, and that the accused had done nothing more than to ward off her attempts.

## The issues and my approach

14     As the prosecution submitted, given the definition of “voluntarily to cause hurt” in s 321 of the Penal Code, in determining whether the accused had committed the offence of voluntarily causing hurt punishable under s 323 of the Penal Code I had to decide whether the following three elements had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt:

> (a)     first, that the accused grabbed and twisted Ms Shin’s right arm;

> (b)     second, that the accused did so knowing it to be likely that he would thereby cause hurt to Ms Shin; and

> (c)     third, that the accused thereby caused Ms Shin to sustain a right TFCC injury.

15     Given the parties’ positions and the state of the evidence, my approach was first to consider the third element. This entailed assessing the nature and cause of Ms Shin’s injury. In this regard the parties had canvassed three broad possibilities: (a) that her right wrist had not been injured at all and she had merely feigned injury, (b) that she had had a pre-existing right TFCC injury prior to the incident on 26 September 2020 such that there was no causal link between that injury and the incident, or (c) the incident caused her to sustain a right TFCC injury. The reason why I considered the third element first was that it depended on the medical evidence, and I thought that the medical evidence was the least controversial aspect of the evidence before me because it had been given by independent professionals who could not possibly have had any personal stake in the outcome of these proceedings against the accused, and because the accused had not called any doctor of his own to the stand and, as such, had not put forward any admissible material inconsistent with the evidence of the doctors called by the prosecution.

16     From the medical evidence I concluded that Ms Shin sustained a right TFCC injury as a result of physical contact with the accused during the incident on 26 September 2020. With this premise established I turned to the first and second elements. In that connection the disputed non-medical evidence gave rise to two alternative hypotheses: either the accused grabbed and twisted Ms Shin’s arm, which was the prosecution’s position, or he caused the injury unintentionally in taking the purely defensive action of blocking her as she attempted to grab the menu he was holding, which was the version of events advanced by him and his family members whom he called as witnesses. The former would give rise to criminal liability but the latter would not.

## The nature and cause of Ms Shin’s injury

17     In ascertaining the nature and cause of Ms Shin’s injury I relied largely on the evidence of Dr Liao. I thought that Dr Liao was familiar with the physical condition of Ms Shin’s right wrist given that she had examined Ms Shin on 5 October 2020, about nine days after the incident involving the accused, and thereafter examined her on three further occasions on 19 October 2020, 16 November 2020 and 4 January 2021. I was also satisfied that Dr Liao had a substantial degree of medical knowledge and expertise in matters relating to the hand. She trained for seven years to attain her hand-specialist qualifications (see the certified transcript of the trial proceedings (“CT”) at Day 5 p 20 lines 30–31), and given that at the time of her testimony in court on 18 November 2021 she had been a hand specialist for two-and-a-half years (CT at Day 5 p 20 lines 25–26), when she first examined Ms Shin on 5 October 2020 she would have had more than a year’s working experience as a hand specialist over and above her seven years’ training.

### The medical diagnosis of a right TFCC injury

18     Dr Liao’s diagnosis was that Ms Shin had sustained a TFCC injury. Dr Liao explained in court that patients with such an injury would “present with pain and swelling over ulnar side of the wrist, with reduced range of motion especially pronosupination”, and would be observed on examination to “have swelling and tenderness over the ulnar … fovea”, and would “in more severe cases” have “laxity” in the distal radioulnar joint (CT at Day 5 p 42 lines 8–16). Given Dr Liao’s knowledge and expertise, and the absence of contrary medical evidence, I accepted this as a wholly correct description of the signs and symptoms that would generally be seen in patients with TFCC injuries.

19     I pause to set out the understanding of some of the relevant medical terminology that I obtained from the evidence. From Dr Bey’s testimony (CT at Day 4 p 5 lines 1–19) I learnt that the “ulna” is a bone that “extends from the wrist all the way back to the elbow”. The “distal ulna” denotes a location along that bone that is closer to the wrist than to the elbow – where it is closer to the elbow the term is “proximal”. The “ulnar” side of the wrist is that which is closer to the body on the horizontal plane when the palm is facing upward – it is the side where the little finger is, and the side further away, where the thumb is, is the “radial”. As for “pronosupination”, Dr Liao explained that this referred to a “twisting motion of the forearm” (CT at Day 5 p 26 lines 10–11).

20     Prior to Dr Liao’s diagnosis, the initial diagnosis in the A&E Report of Ms Shin’s condition was that she had sustained a “right distal ulnar fracture”. This was in large part because, as stated in the A&E Report and the Specialist Report, the X-ray of Ms Shin’s right wrist carried out on 26 September 2020 showed a fracture of her distal ulna. I understand that the charge originally framed against the accused alleged that he had caused Ms Shin to sustain a wrist fracture, the reason being that at the time the accused was first charged only the A&E Report had been obtained. But with the benefit of further medical scans and examination it has since become clear that, as Dr Liao explained in court, this fracture was an “old” one that did not occur “in recent times” (CT at Day 5 p 24 lines 12–21). Thus it was not suggested at any point in the trial that the incident on 26 September 2020 had caused Ms Shin to sustain a fracture.

21     The Specialist Report contains little information about the physical condition of Ms Shin when Dr Liao examined her on 5 October 2020. But when Dr Liao testified in court she was able to provide much more detail in this regard. Dr Liao explained that even though this detail was not mentioned in the Specialist Report it was “documented in the medical record” (CT at Day 5 p 26 lines 3–4), and she or a medical officer accompanying her prepared this medical record “at the same time” the examination of Ms Shin took place, and she or the medical officer would also vet the record (CT at Day 5 p 21 lines 21–30). Given this explanation I was satisfied that Dr Liao’s testimony in court as to what occurred during the examination of Ms Shin was based on contemporaneous notes and was thus accurate, and so I accepted her testimony as a reliable supplementation of the contents of the Specialist Report.

22     On the basis of Dr Liao’s testimony in court, I found that when she examined Ms Shin on 5 October 2020 Ms Shin had “signs of acute swelling and pain … over her ulnar fovea” (CT at Day 5 p 26 lines 25–26), “pain and some laxity” when her distal radioulnar joint was stressed (CT at Day 5 p 25 lines 23–24), and reduced range of motion on “flexion, extension and pronosupination” (CT at Day 5 p 26 lines 4–13). These observations fit very closely the signs and symptoms generally seen in patients with TFCC injuries (as set out at \[18\] above), and so seemed to me to constitute compelling evidence that Ms Shin had a TFCC injury by 5 October 2020.

23     Moreover, the Specialist Report records that the CT scan carried out on Ms Shin on 13 October 2020 showed a “dorsal subluxation of the distal ulna”. Dr Bey explained in court that this refers to a “partial dislocation” in the sense of “a slight abnormality in the location of the right distal ulnar bone from … the wrist joint” (CT at Day 4 p 9 lines 9–19). Dr Liao testified that the “dorsal subluxation” could be a result of a TFCC injury (CT at Day 5 p 28 lines 5–6) and was “suggestive” of such an injury (CT at Day 5 p 45 lines 6–7). This was therefore further evidence that Ms Shin had that injury by 5 October 2020.

24     For these reasons I accepted without reservation Dr Liao’s diagnosis that Ms Shin had sustained a right TFCC injury. Although this diagnosis was based on an examination that took place more than a week after the incident involving the accused on 26 September 2020, I had no doubt that Ms Shin had sustained the right TFCC injury by the time she saw Dr Bey at the NTFGH A&E department on 26 September 2020. This was because when Ms Shin saw Dr Bey there were already indications that her right wrist had been injured. As alluded to earlier (at \[6\] above), the A&E Report recorded “some tenderness over her right ulnar styloid and distal ulna” and “pain on the extremes of flexion as well as on ulna and radial deviation”.

25     Accordingly, I rejected the suggestion by the accused that Ms Shin might have been feigning injury altogether when she cried out and squatted while holding her right wrist at the Restaurant on 26 September 2020. I would add that the plausibility of that suggestion was much diminished to begin with by the existence of the dorsal subluxation and the swelling at Ms Shin’s right wrist. These were objectively ascertainable signs and symptoms that could not possibly have been faked.

### Whether the TFCC injury might have been a chronic pre-existing one

26     I had then to deal with the accused’s suggestion that Ms Shin’s TFCC injury could have been a chronic pre-existing one that he had not caused. He advanced this case primarily on the basis that even prior to her encounter with him Ms Shin had been wearing plasters or patches near her right wrist that were meant for pain relief. He suggested that Ms Shin might have sustained this chronic pre-existing injury from repetitive use of her wrist as she worked in the kitchen over months and years.

27     There was no question that Ms Shin had an old right wrist fracture, and I was willing to assume that an old fracture might possibly give rise to persistent residual disabilities in that wrist. I was also prepared to find that even before Ms Shin cried out and squatted holding her right wrist she had been wearing pain-relief patches on that wrist. This was because Mr Song testified that he saw those patches at the time he witnessed Ms Shin squat and hold her wrist (CT at Day 3 p 12 lines 26–28 and p 14 lines 24–30).

28     But on the strength of Dr Liao’s evidence I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Ms Shin’s right TFCC injury was not a chronic one that had existed even before 26 September 2020. Dr Liao testified that if a patient has a chronic injury arising from repetitive use they “usually will not have acute swelling and pain” (CT at Day 5 p 28 lines 22–24). That being so, the fact that Dr Liao observed acute swelling and pain over Ms Shin’s right ulnar fovea on 5 October 2020 was weighty evidence that Ms Shin’s right TFCC injury was not a chronic one. Dr Liao explained that “acute” pain is understood in contrast to “insidious” pain. Where an injury is chronic the pain is “usually more insidious”, in that the pain “happens slowly” and “comes and goes” such that patients “usually don’t recall any event that brought this pain on in the first place” (CT at Day 5 p 34 lines 15–18). On the other hand, acute pain arises in a “sudden” manner such that the patients “usually … remember when it happens” (CT at Day 5 p 33 lines 31–32). In Ms Shin’s case, at the examination on 5 October 2020 she informed Dr Liao definitively that the pain had started on 26 September 2020 (CT at Day 5 p 34 line 21 to p 35 line 5). Thus Ms Shin’s pain was acute in nature and so unlikely to have been caused by a chronic injury.

29     Another reason Dr Liao offered for her view that Ms Shin’s TFCC injury was not likely to have been chronic was that Ms Shin had responded to the TFCC “rehabilitation protocol” that Dr Liao prescribed, in that Ms Shin’s “symptoms improved at the end of 3 months of this rehabilitation protocol” (CT at Day 5 p 26 lines 27–32). This protocol was a “standardised” one comprising “total immobilisation with a Muenster splint”, which is a splint that goes up to the elbow, for a period of one month to six weeks, followed by “range of motion exercises” for one month, and then “strengthening” for the final one month (CT at Day 5 p 30 lines 2–20). Dr Liao explained that “usually … a chronic injury is less likely to respond” to such a protocol (CT at Day 5 p 27 lines 3–4). Given Dr Liao’s professional learning and experience I deferred to her testimony and accepted Ms Shin’s responsiveness to the rehabilitation protocol as additional evidence that her TFCC injury was not a chronic one.

30     As for the presence of pain-relief patches near Ms Shin’s right wrist, I did not think it possible to draw any firm inferences or conclusions from this. It could, as the accused suggested, indicate that Ms Shin was living with a chronic right TFCC injury even before the incident on 26 September 2020. But I thought that there could be other plausible explanations for the patches that were not inconsistent with Ms Shin having sustained an acute right TFCC injury on 26 September 2020. It might be that Ms Shin had an intact TFCC but wore the patches to ameliorate discomfort around her right wrist that did not reach a level or degree sufficient to be perceived as pain, or that she was injury-free but wore the patches as a pre-emptive step in the hope of preventing chronic pain or a chronic injury from arising. Looking at the matter holistically in the light of the cogent medical evidence from Dr Liao, I did not think that the mere presence of pain-relief patches generated reasonable doubt in the accused’s favour.

31     Hence I ruled out the possibility that Ms Shin might have had a chronic pre-existing right TFCC injury. It followed that Ms Shin’s right TFCC injury was caused by an event that occurred on 26 September 2020. It was not disputed that on that day Ms Shin cried out and squatted holding her right wrist in the course of her dispute with the accused at the Restaurant and thereafter required the attention of paramedics, and was then taken to NTFGH where Dr Bey observed tenderness around her right wrist. Given this sequence of events, and given my certainty that Ms Shin was not feigning injury, I had no doubt that the event on 26 September 2020 that caused her right TFCC injury was physical contact with the accused during their dispute.

## Whether the accused grabbed and twisted Ms Shin’s right arm

32     As alluded to earlier (at \[16\] above), I was presented with two alternative hypotheses as to the way in which the physical contact with the accused had caused Ms Shin to sustain her TFCC injury. Either he grabbed and twisted her arm, or he caused the injury inadvertently when acting in self-defence to block her as she attempted to grab the menu he was holding.

### The key evidence incriminating the accused

33     The prosecution relied on testimony from four witnesses who all said that they personally experienced or witnessed the incident between Ms Shin and the accused. Purely to provide a more complete and vivid picture of the proceedings before me, I describe briefly here my broad overall impressions of them from their time in court.

> (a)     Ms Shin gave evidence through a Korean interpreter. She was composed during examination-in-chief and re-examination by the prosecution, but was visibly indignant and exasperated at times during cross-examination by the accused.

> (b)     Ms Wang Ying gave evidence through a Mandarin interpreter. She spoke throughout in a measured and deliberate manner and never with heightened emotion. She seemed very sure of her recollection of events and struck me as candid, for instance in the way she readily acknowledged that the photographs of dishes in the Restaurant’s menu might depict a larger portion than what would actually be served to customers (CT at Day 2 p 22 line 19 to p 23 line 24).

> (c)     Ms Som gave evidence in English. She spoke at a fast pace and tended in giving her account to compress events and omit the smaller steps or details in a given sequence of events, but when specifically directed to the details and invited to comment would give more granular descriptions and fill in what had been omitted. She was forthcoming about the fact that she could not remember various details and that her evidence was at times based on reconstruction or reasonable assumption.

> (d)     Mr Song gave evidence through a Korean interpreter. He was succinct and straightforward in his responses to questions and was ready to acknowledge an inability to recall various details of what had happened.

34     As mentioned above (at \[12\]), two of the prosecution witnesses, namely Ms Shin and Ms Som, testified in court that the accused grabbed and twisted Ms Shin’s right arm, while one of them, namely Ms Wang Ying, testified that the accused grabbed Ms Shin’s arm and thereafter Ms Shin’s palm was bent downwards and her hand started to swell. The three of them differed as to the exact part of Ms Shin’s arm that the accused grabbed.

> (a)     When Ms Shin demonstrated the act of grabbing in court, the contact was at the palm (CT at Day 1 p 20 line 18 to p 21 line 5), and elsewhere in her testimony she said that the accused had grabbed her palm (CT at Day 1 p 68 line 6). Although elsewhere in her testimony Ms Shin also referred to her wrist having been grabbed, and the A&E Report records that she reported that her “right wrist” had been grabbed, Ms Shin explained that she mentioned her wrist because when the accused grabbed her palm and twisted it was her wrist that hurt. I was satisfied that there was no internal contradiction in Ms Shin’s evidence and that her position was that the accused had grabbed her palm.

> (b)     Ms Wang Ying testified that the accused grabbed Ms Shin at the “wrist area” (CT at Day 2 p 11 lines 26–27).

> (c)     Ms Som testified that the accused grabbed Ms Shin’s “forearm”, and when she demonstrated in court the location along Ms Shin’s forearm where contact was made I recorded it as being below the wrist away from the hand (CT at Day 2 p 43 lines 17–28).

35     The fourth prosecution witness, Mr Song, testified that what he saw was that the accused “pushed” Ms Shin’s hand “very hard” (CT at Day 3 p 7 lines 11–18). The accused sought to rely on Mr Song’s evidence in this regard, characterising Mr Song as a “neutral party”. He argued that Mr Song’s evidence was inconsistent with that of Ms Shin, Ms Wang Ying and Ms Som because Mr Song did not say that he saw the accused grab Ms Shin’s arm, and this showed that Ms Shin, Ms Wang Ying and Ms Som had all spoken falsely when they said in court that they had witnessed him grab Ms Shin’s arm.

36     I rejected this argument of the accused. As the prosecution pointed out, Mr Song also testified that the incident had occurred “all of a sudden” so that he could not remember whether the accused had “grabbed or … held any part” of Ms Shin’s arm (CT at Day 3 p 8 lines 17–19). Hence I thought that Mr Song’s evidence did not rule out the possibility that the accused had grabbed Ms Shin’s arm. On the contrary, I thought that Mr Song’s evidence positively undermined the accused’s allegation that he had been acting in self-defence against Ms Shin. When the accused suggested to Mr Song in cross-examination that he had used his hands merely “to block and not to push” Ms Shin, Mr Song said that to him it looked like a push (CT at Day 3 p 15 line 29 to p 16 line 4). Thus Mr Song’s evidence was that the accused was the aggressor when he made contact with Ms Shin, and this did not support the accused’s case that he was acting defensively.

37     As for the differences between Ms Shin, Ms Wang Ying and Ms Som as to the exact part of Ms Shin’s arm that the accused grabbed, I did not think that this undermined their testimonies. Given that the incident had occurred “all of a sudden”, in Mr Song’s words, I believed that in the rush of events the witnesses might not have perceived precisely where the contact was, and so it was not surprising that their evidence might diverge on that detail. The important point in my view was that all three of them agreed that the accused had grabbed Ms Shin’s arm near her wrist, and two of them agreed that he had twisted Ms Shin’s arm while the evidence of the remaining one was consistent with this in that it implied that he had done something to Ms Shin’s arm after grabbing it to cause her palm to bend and her hand to swell.

38     I therefore regarded the testimonies of these four prosecution witnesses as compelling evidence that the accused had grabbed Ms Shin’s arm near her right wrist and twisted. Their testimonies also ran counter to the accused’s allegation that he had merely been acting in self-defence by blocking Ms Shin’s attempts to snatch the menu in his hand.

### The honesty and motives of the prosecution witnesses

39     Faced with all this incriminating testimony, the accused sought to undermine the credibility of these prosecution witnesses except for Mr Song. He alleged that Ms Shin was seeking to frame him and pin liability on him for her old wrist injury, and that Ms Wang Ying and Ms Som had fallen in with Ms Shin given that they were her employees. But I found this unconvincing.

40     Starting with Ms Wang Ying and Ms Som, I was unable to discern any motive that they might have for giving false testimony against him. By the time they gave evidence in court they had both ceased to be employed at the Restaurant, and so they no longer had any working or social relationship with Ms Shin. Hence I did not see how they would have had anything to gain by framing the accused, or how they would have felt beholden to Ms Shin and obliged to help her if she were intent on framing him. Further, I thought that they gave their evidence in a fair and neutral manner. In particular, as the prosecution pointed out, Ms Wang Ying had no qualms about saying that Ms Shin’s attitude towards the accused was “not as good” (CT at Day 2 p 26 line 2), and Ms Som characterised Ms Shin as having acted in an “angsty” and “angry” and “passive-aggressive” manner during the incident with the accused (CT at Day 2 p 43 lines 2–9). The fact that both Ms Wang Ying and Ms Som were ready to describe Ms Shin’s conduct in those negative terms strongly suggested to me that they had no allegiances in this matter and were thus impartial and unbiased observers.

41     As for Ms Shin herself, I was likewise unable to see any reason why she would want to frame the accused. To begin with, on the basis of the medical evidence I had already rejected any suggestion that Ms Shin might have been feigning injury when she cried out and squatted holding her right wrist during the incident with the accused, or that her right TFCC injury was a chronic one that she had had all along. It appeared to me that these findings necessarily cut away the premise underlying the accused’s allegation of deceit and blackmail against Ms Shin. Over and above that, while I accepted that Ms Shin felt angry towards the accused on the day of the incident as a result of his complaints about the food, I could not believe that she would have sought to take revenge on him by making a false complaint against him. It seemed to me that Ms Shin underwent a substantial amount of inconvenience after 26 September 2020, in that she could not work for a while and had to visit the hospital several times over the next three or four months for treatment and therapy. My impression of Ms Shin from her time in court was that she was a rational and reasonable person, and I found incredible the notion that she would go through all that and then give false evidence in court out of nothing more than a grudge against the accused. And even if Ms Shin had already had discomfort in her right wrist prior to the incident I did not see what she would have to gain by blaming the accused for it given that I did not understand her to have sought any financial compensation from him.

42     Therefore I rejected the accused’s allegation that Ms Shin, Ms Wang Ying and Ms Som were all conspiring or conniving to accuse him of something he had not done. I had no doubt instead that they were honest witnesses seeking to give a truthful account of the incident that occurred in the Restaurant on 26 September 2020.

### The accused’s criticisms of the prosecution’s evidence

43     Besides impugning generally the motives of Ms Shin, Ms Wang Ying and Ms Som, the accused also advanced several specific criticisms of their evidence in support of his contention that they should not be believed. I found none of those criticisms persuasive. Before I explain why, I summarise the testimonies of Ms Wang Ying and Ms Som to the extent needed to understand the criticisms that the accused put forward.

44     Ms Som testified that she was working at the Restaurant on 26 September 2020 and that she delivered the accused’s order to his table in the small room. The order included raw meat, and she proceeded to grill this meat over the barbeque stove at the table. While she was doing so the accused asked why the order that had been delivered looked so different from the pictures in the menu (CT at Day 2 p 38 line 28 to p 39 line 6). Noticing that the accused was “slowly getting agitated” she went out of the small room and asked “lady boss \[_ie_, Ms Shin\] for help” (CT at Day 2 p 40 lines 18–20). Ms Shin entered the small room and took over the task of grilling the meat, and so Ms Som “went out to continue to serve other customers” (CT at Day 2 p 41 lines 10–12). Thereafter Ms Som “heard a big commotion”. She “walked past the area” and saw Ms Shin “aggressively” returning the grilled meat to the plate it had come in with the intention of taking the plate out, “but then the customer \[_ie_, the accused\] held” Ms Shin’s arm “and then after that twisted it, because clearly he was … in agitation” (CT at Day 2 p 41 lines 16–26). Ms Som said that when the accused twisted Ms Shin’s arm he was “in the midst of standing” (CT at Day 2 p 44 lines 7–10). Ms Som proceeded to call the ambulance, and about 20 or 30 minutes later called the police on the instructions of the male boss of the Restaurant (CT at Day 2 p 38 lines 11–17). As to the fact that the first information report recorded a reference to scalding (as mentioned at \[5\] above), Ms Som explained that she “assumed” that Ms Shin had “scalded her arm because of the proximity with the grill”, but found out later on checking directly with Ms Shin that Ms Shin had not in fact scalded her arm.

45     Ms Wang Ying testified that she too was working at the Restaurant on 26 September 2020. She had not been involved in taking or delivering the accused’s order. Her interaction with the accused began when “the waiter or waitress who was grilling the meat \[at the accused’s table\] came over and call\[ed\] out” for her. She understood from her colleague that the accused was “not satisfied with the … meal that he ordered, because what was eventually served was different from the menu” (CT at Day 2 p 7 lines 14–23). She spoke to the accused in the small room but he remained “rowdy” in that “his voice was very loud and it affected a lot of customers” who “turned to look”, and so she had to “call the lady boss to come over” (CT at Day 2 p 8 lines 4–27). Even with Ms Shin there the accused was “still quite agitated”. Eventually Ms Shin “removed the grill plates from the table” because she did not want the accused to continue dining at the Restaurant. Ms Wang Ying recalled Ms Shin informing the accused that he would not have to pay for what he had ordered (CT at Day 2 p 9 lines 6–26). Then the accused stood up “holding on to the menu in his hand”, and Ms Shin “went to snatch the menu from him”. Ms Wang Ying said that Ms Shin’s first attempt at snatching was unsuccessful, and when she tried a second time, the accused “grabbed hold of the lady boss hand” (CT at Day 2 p 10 lines 5–20). Ms Wang Ying testified that she “could not see if he had used force when he was grabbing on to the lady boss’s hand”, but what transpired next was that Ms Shin “let out a … cry”, and Ms Wang Ying saw that Ms Shin’s “palm was actually bent downwards and the hand started to swell”. She explained that as all this occurred she was “standing between the both of them \[_ie_, Ms Shin and the accused\], in the middle” (CT at Day 2 p 11 lines 14–25).

46     A noteworthy point is that Ms Som said repeatedly that she did not recall Ms Wang Ying having entered or been present in the small room where the incident between Ms Shin and the accused occurred (CT at Day 2 p 54 lines 1–3, p 55 lines 17–20, p 57 lines 11–12). Although Ms Wang Ying said that she had herself been summoned to the small room by “the waiter or waitress who was grilling the meat”, who would have been Ms Som, Ms Som testified that she did not remember any colleague entering the small room before she went to get Ms Shin (CT at Day 2 p 41 lines 7–9). Both Ms Som and Ms Wang Ying recollected having been the one to call Ms Shin into the small room to attend to the accused.

47     I address now the accused’s criticisms, roughly in descending order of importance. I should mention that I might present his criticisms in a form that is rather different from that in which they were raised before me. Being unrepresented by counsel the accused raised his criticisms at various stages of the proceedings, and not only during closing submissions. For ease of comprehension I have endeavoured to draw the threads together and extract his key arguments. I should mention also that I address only those criticisms that I have deemed meaningful enough to warrant a response.

48     First, the accused argued that Ms Wang Ying did not witness the incident between him and Ms Shin. He said that he had never met or seen Ms Wang Ying before. He cited in support Ms Som’s stated inability to recall Ms Wang Ying’s presence at the scene.

49     I did not give weight to this criticism. Given that there was a substantial period of more than nine months between the incident on 26 September 2020 and the time Ms Som gave evidence in court on 12 July 2021, I thought it was entirely plausible that her inability to remember Ms Wang Ying’s involvement might simply have been a failure of memory. After all, Ms Som did testify that she remembered Ms Wang Ying working at the Restaurant on 26 September 2020 (CT at Day 2 p 55 lines 7–10). Ms Som also accepted that it was a tenable assumption that she would have “approached Wang Ying first” because she perceived a “language barrier” between her and the accused (CT at Day 2 p 55 lines 30–32), in that she “could not grasp completely” his “Chinese accent” in addition to the fact that she was “a little bit bad at Chinese as well”, and Ms Wang Ying would have been better able to communicate with him (CT at Day 2 p 57 lines 2–10). Hence, viewing Ms Som’s evidence holistically, I did not think it excluded the possibility that Ms Wang Ying had been present in the small room to observe the incident between Ms Shin and the accused. Ms Wang Ying gave clear and firm evidence that she had been, and I could see no reason at all why she would say this and go to the trouble of attending court as a witness if this had not in fact been so, and so Ms Som’s evidence did not introduce any substantial doubt in my mind on this point.

50     Second, the accused argued that given the limited size of the small room in which the incident occurred there could not have been sufficient space for him to grab and twist Ms Shin’s arm as alleged, and there also could not have been sufficient space to accommodate Ms Wang Ying. He added that the space would have been reduced still further by the presence of a food trolley located at the entrance to the room. I accepted that the room was a small one. That was apparent from the photographs that were in evidence, namely photographs 3 and 4 in exhibit P2 and exhibits D2 and D4. I also accepted on the basis of Ms Shin’s evidence that there had been a trolley near the entrance to the room (CT at Day 1 p 64 lines 28–32).

51     But I did not think that the accused’s points were valid. Although I did not have measurements of the room, it was an undisputed fact that Ms Shin was standing next to the accused in the room. Using D4 to gauge the accused’s location relative to the barbeque stove, he was seated around the place where the two chairs meet in photograph 4 in P2, and Ms Shin was standing to the right of the table. I did not see why it would have been physically improbable for the accused to have grabbed and twisted Ms Shin’s arm while they were next to each other in close proximity, and so it seemed to me that there would have been enough space in the small room for him to do so.

52     As for the point concerning Ms Wang Ying – whose testimony, to reiterate, was that she was “standing between” the accused and Ms Shin, “in the middle” – although I agreed that there would likely not have been enough space for Ms Wang Ying to have stood in the small room between them such that all three of them formed a straight line, I did not think that this was the positioning Ms Wang Ying intended to convey because it would mean that she was directly in the way of the physical struggle between the accused and Ms Shin, which by all accounts she was not. I thought it far more sensible to interpret Ms Wang Ying’s testimony as meaning that she stood between them but closer to the entrance to the room, or perhaps even slightly outside the room, such that the trio formed the points of a triangle containing only acute angles. I did not understand Ms Wang Ying to have testified that she stood inside the small room, and so I thought it entirely plausible that she had stood at the entrance to the room or just outside it, around the spot where the food trolley had been placed, while maintaining a good view of the incident between the accused and Ms Shin. On this interpretation it seemed to me that there was space enough for Ms Wang Ying notwithstanding the small size of the room.

53     Third, the accused argued that Ms Som could not have witnessed the incident between him and Ms Shin. In this connection he relied on Ms Wang Ying’s testimony that after Ms Som had grilled the meat Ms Som left the small room and did not return (CT at Day 2 p 20 lines 8–13). He argued that this contradicted Ms Som’s claim to have seen the incident. But as the prosecution pointed out, Ms Som’s evidence was that she observed the incident from outside the small room, about two metres away, and she added that at that distance she “could clearly see what was happening” given that there was nothing obstructing her view (CT at Day 2 p 44 lines 22–30). Thus Ms Som’s evidence was not inconsistent with Ms Wang Ying’s testimony that Ms Som left the small room before the incident took place and did not return to it. I was satisfied that even though Ms Som was outside the small room serving other customers of the Restaurant she eventually made her way to a point outside the small room from which she was able to see the dispute between Ms Shin and the accused.

54     Fourth, the accused argued that the evidence of the prosecution’s witnesses was inconsistent on the matter of whether he was standing up or sitting down when he allegedly grabbed and twisted Ms Shin’s arm. It is true that their testimonies diverged in that regard, in that Ms Wang Ying said that he was standing and Ms Som that he was “in the midst of standing” but Ms Shin and Mr Song said that the accused was sitting (CT at Day 1 p 20 line 1, and at Day 3 p 8 line 23). But given the substantial lapse in time between the incident on 26 September 2020 and the time they gave evidence in court, I did not expect the prosecution’s witnesses to recall all the details of the incident with precision. I thought that the physical contact between the accused and Ms Shin would have been a significant and extraordinary occurrence in comparison with which the surrounding circumstances might in the witnesses’ memory recede into the background as being of less importance. I considered that this matter of whether the accused was standing or sitting was a relatively trivial or minor circumstance that might reasonably be forgotten or misremembered by honest people whose recollections were otherwise accurate, and so the differences between the witnesses on that matter did not suggest to me that they were untruthful or that their testimonies were erroneous in other aspects.

55     Fifth, the accused pointed out that Ms Som could not recall many details. But, as just discussed, I did not find this surprising given the time that had elapsed since the incident when Ms Som gave evidence in court. Thus this did not undermine my view that Ms Som was generally a reliable witness.

56     Sixth, the accused complained at some length that the prosecution and police had previously made unjustified allegations that he had scalded Ms Shin and caused her to sustain a wrist fracture. I thought that these complaints led nowhere. The simple answer was that these elements of scalding and fracture formed no part of the allegations against the accused at trial, and so there was no prejudice whatsoever to the accused occasioned by earlier references to those elements. In any event I was amply satisfied that there were reasonable explanations for those earlier references. The reference to scalding was entirely derived from the first information report, and I accepted Ms Som’s explanation in her testimony (summarised at \[44\] above) that this arose out of an honest mistake, and I accepted also the testimony of the investigation officer Ms Emma Toh (who gave evidence as PW9) that there had been no mention of scalding in any earlier version of the charge against the accused. As for the reference to a fracture, as I have explained (at \[20\] above), this was based on the A&E Report, which diagnosed Ms Shin as having sustained such an injury. That was unquestionably a reasonable diagnosis given the X-ray and examination of Ms Shin carried out on 26 September 2020, and I could see nothing untoward in the fact that the Specialist Report, which revealed that the fracture was an old one unconnected to the accused, was sought and obtained only later.

57     For these reasons, the criticisms of the testimonies of the prosecution’s witnesses that the accused put forward did not move me from my view that Ms Shin, Ms Wang Ying, Ms Som and Mr Song were all striving to tell the truth and were largely accurate in their accounts of events. This meant that I continued to regard their testimonies as compelling evidence that the accused had grabbed and twisted Ms Shin’s arm.

### The evidence of the accused and the defence witnesses

58     I had then to weigh in the balance the testimonies of the accused and his witnesses Ms Wang Lin Ke and Ms Fei. I convey here my broad overall impressions of them from their time in court.

> (a)     The accused gave evidence through a Mandarin interpreter. He did so in a forceful, strident and combative fashion. He seemed to feel earnestly that he had been gravely maligned by Ms Shin and the prosecution witnesses, and it was clear that he saw himself as a victim of great injustice in having had to endure this criminal prosecution.

> (b)     Ms Wang Lin Ke gave evidence through a Mandarin interpreter. She was more tentative and hesitant in her manner compared to the accused, but was firm and unyielding in affirming his innocence on the charge and in portraying him as one who had been wronged by Ms Shin and the prosecution witnesses.

> (c)     Ms Fei gave evidence in English. She came across as confident and assured. She spoke in an emotionally neutral tone that at times verged on light-hearted breeziness.

59     I thought that they all told the same story such that there were no glaring inconsistencies or contradictions within or between their accounts that might signal falsehood. They all testified that after Ms Shin entered the small room she angrily cleared the accused’s order from the table. When the accused tried taking a photograph of the menu, Ms Shin attempted to snatch the menu from him by clawing or scrabbling at him repeatedly with her arms. Both the accused and Ms Wang Lin Ke demonstrated in court what this clawing or scrabbling motion looked like: they raised both arms slightly above their heads, then in rapidly alternating fashion brought each arm down and stretched it out ahead of them, as if pedaling a bicycle with their arms. The accused and Ms Fei testified that he used his arm to block Ms Shin as she was clawing at him. All three of them agreed that Ms Shin then cried out and squatted holding her hand.

60     But I was unable to believe the version of events advanced by the accused and his witnesses. As a starting point I could not ignore the fact that all three of them had a clear interest in giving evidence that would exculpate the accused. The accused would want naturally to be acquitted on the charge, and Ms Wang Lin Ke and Ms Fei would as his kin naturally also desire that outcome. Thus I had to treat their testimonies with a degree of circumspection.

61     I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that there were two aspects of the accused’s case that undermined its veracity. First, the accused made allegations about the conduct of Mr Song during the incident that I thought were unfounded given the internally inconsistent position that the accused took in respect of Mr Song’s evidence. At the start of the trial the accused tendered a letter (exhibit D9) asking that I “disqualify” Mr Song as a witness on the ground that Mr Song and his dining companion had been “shouting and banging tables at \[the accused\] during the incident”. The accused described them as having engaged in “incitement and agitation” such as to convey “the impression that they are ready for a fight, to root for the lady boss \[_ie_, Ms Shin\]”. I denied the accused’s request to disqualify Mr Song given that I saw no legal basis to do so, and when Mr Song attended court the accused alleged that Mr Song and his dining companion had “knocked on the table” to “instigate” Ms Shin (CT at Day 3 p 11 line 27 to p 12 line 21). Mr Song categorically denied having done so, but even after this the accused persisted in his allegation that Mr Song had participated in the incident and incited Ms Shin (CT at Day 6 p 56 lines 24–29).

62     Despite having made these allegations against Mr Song the accused sought ultimately to rely on Mr Song’s testimony as evidence that he had not grabbed and twisted Ms Shin’s arm. In oral closing submissions the accused submitted that Mr Song had spoken “the truth” (CT at Day 8 p 25 lines 11–13). In effect the accused’s position was that Mr Song was truthful when he said that he had seen the accused push Ms Shin’s arm but untruthful when he said that he had not hit the table and incited Ms Shin. I thought that this was an internally inconsistent and unsustainable position for the accused to take. I agreed with the proposition put by the prosecution to the accused that it did not make sense for Mr Song to have told the truth regarding one aspect of the incident while lying regarding another. The accused did not offer any rational explanation for why Mr Song might have done so (CT at Day 6 p 55 line 11 to p 56 line 23).

63     Given the accused’s own reliance on most of Mr Song’s evidence, I was satisfied that Mr Song was an honest witness who endeavoured in court to narrate nothing more nor less than what he had seen and heard of the incident between Ms Shin and the accused. That being so I believed that he had not tried in any way to incite Ms Shin. I could see no reason why he would have wanted to do so given that he was simply having a meal in the Restaurant and would have had no interest in the goings-on between Ms Shin and the accused. It followed that the accused had levelled false allegations against Mr Song. This negatively affected my assessment of the accused’s overall credibility.

64     Second, as the proceedings went on the accused embellished his account of the manner in which Ms Shin had attempted to snatch the menu from him, and I thought that he failed to provide an acceptable explanation for the belated nature of the embellishment. As mentioned above (at \[59\]), the accused testified that Ms Shin clawed at him repeatedly and demonstrated in court how this was done. I considered this to be a major detail of his case given that it concerned the extent of Ms Shin’s alleged aggression towards him, which would provide important context to his claim that he acted in self-defence against her. It was apparent that the accused also regarded this as a significant detail given that in his examination-in-chief of Ms Wang Lin Ke he prompted her by demonstrating that action (CT Day 7 p 21 line 25 to p 22 line 7, and p 30 line 19 to p 31 line 20). Yet, as the prosecution pointed out, the accused did not mention or demonstrate this alleged repeated clawing in his cross-examination of the prosecution’s witnesses. The first time that it emerged was when he gave evidence after I had called on him to give his defence.

65     I did not think that the accused adequately explained his omission to allege or demonstrate the repeated clawing earlier in the proceedings. When I invited him to explain the omission during oral closing submissions I understood his answer to be that when cross-examining the prosecution’s witnesses his questions were guided by the contents of their testimonies and not by his own version of events (CT at Day 8 p 33 line 17 to p 34 line 12). But even accepting that being unrepresented by counsel he might be unaware of the need to put his case to the prosecution’s witnesses on points of disagreement, I found his answer unconvincing because it seemed to me that he had not had any difficulty challenging the prosecution’s witnesses with allegations that went beyond their testimonies. To illustrate, when he cross-examined Ms Shin, he was fully able to allege that she had been “in a fit of anger” when she entered the small room and that she was “yelling” and her “attitude was poor” (CT at Day 1 p 52 lines 13–21), even though she had testified in examination-in-chief that she had apologised to him many times and did not raise her voice (CT at Day 1 p 17 line 24 to p 18 line 15). Hence I would have expected him to allege and demonstrate the repeated clawing at least during his cross-examination of Ms Shin, especially given that he alleged while cross-examining her that she had “started to grab and snatch the menu” (CT at Day 1 p 54 lines 25–32).

66     The inference I drew was that the accused’s allegation that Ms Shin had clawed at him repeatedly was a mere afterthought and invention intended to buttress his case of self-defence. I could see no other reason why the accused had not made the allegation earlier in the proceedings. The fact that the accused was prepared to embellish his account with an untrue allegation further undermined his overall credibility. It undermined also Ms Wang Lin Ke’s credibility given that she had made the same allegation.

67     In addition I thought that the evidence of Ms Fei was quite incredible. As mentioned above (at \[13\]), Ms Fei testified that even though she had been assigned a separate table in the main dining area, she got up and went to the small room where the incident occurred after having heard the accused speaking to a waitress, and in this way she ended up witnessing the incident. She said that she stood right behind the accused’s chair (CT at Day 7 p 36 line 30 to p 37 line 1) – referring to photograph 4 in P2, she elaborated that she stood “in between the chairs and the partition board” (CT at Day 7 p 70 lines 16–25). She was in the small room long enough to see a waitress go out and call first the male boss and then Ms Shin into the room, and to see Ms Shin attempt to grab the menu that the accused was holding and thereafter squat holding her hand (CT at Day 7 p 37 line 9 to p 38 line 14), and the whole time she remained standing behind the accused’s chair (CT at Day 7 p 65 line 30 to p 66 line 5). Through all this she did not say anything and did not intervene in any way (CT at Day 7 p 65 lines 12–29 and p 66 lines 19–28).

68     I found this testimony very difficult to believe. It appeared to me from the photographs, including D4, that the available space behind the accused’s chair was extremely limited, and so it seemed highly implausible that an adult woman such as Ms Fei could have stood behind the chair all that time without anyone noticing. Even the accused said that he had not seen Ms Fei enter the small room (CT at Day 7 p 38 lines 15–16). I also thought it exceedingly unrealistic that she would not have reacted in any way to the incident as it unfolded, especially given her own evidence that she had gone to the small room because she thought that the accused might need some sort of help given that his English was not very good (CT at Day 7 p 60 lines 4–11). If she had taken the effort to get up from her table in the main dining area and walk to the small room to assist the accused, it seemed to me unbelievable that she would have stood right behind him without stepping in to lend him aid as the exchange between him and Ms Shin grew acrimonious. Given the inherently improbable nature of Ms Fei’s evidence I considered her an unreliable witness. I thought it likely that she had not in fact been in the small room to witness the incident.

69     Although the prosecution did not put it to Ms Fei in cross-examination that she was lying when she said she had been present in the small room to witness the incident, it is clear from High Court authority that the court may, on a “careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence”, reject testimony that was not contradicted in cross-examination, for instance where that testimony is “obviously fanciful” and “wholly unsupported by documentary evidence”: _Liza bte Ismail v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 1 SLR(R) 555</span> at \[72\] and \[76\]. This seemed to me an appropriate course to take here. Ms Fei’s story struck me as so incredible that I could not accept it as truth under any circumstances.

70     Therefore I gave little weight to the testimonies of the accused and Ms Wang Lin Ke in so far as they differed from the testimonies of the prosecution’s witnesses, and I gave no weight at all to the testimony of Ms Fei. It followed that there was no reliable evidence to support the accused’s case that he made physical contact with Ms Shin unintentionally when acting in self-defence against her attacks as she sought to snatch the menu from him.

## My findings on the elements of the charge

71     Synthesising the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the following material events occurred in the small room in the Restaurant where the accused was seated on 26 September 2020. Ms Som brought the accused’s order to his table, whereupon the accused became upset because the amount of raw meat in the order was significantly less than the quantity depicted in the pictures in the menu. Ms Som called Ms Wang Ying into the room to speak to the accused. Ms Wang Ying was unable to placate him, and so either she or Ms Som called Ms Shin into the room. Ms Shin and the accused exchanged words and both of them became more agitated. The accused spoke loudly and angrily. Ms Shin began to clear the table of the order that had been delivered. Meanwhile the accused tried to take photographs of the menu. Seeing this, Ms Shin told him not to take photographs and tried twice to snatch the menu from him. On the second attempt the accused intentionally grabbed Ms Shin’s right arm near the wrist and twisted. This twist caused Ms Shin to sustain a right TFCC injury.

72     It was not suggested by the prosecution that the accused had intended to inflict a TFCC injury on Ms Shin, but I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that when he grabbed and twisted Ms Shin’s arm the accused at least knew that he was by that act likely to cause “bodily pain” to her, “bodily pain” being one of the meanings of “hurt” under s 319 of the Penal Code. Given that the accused was angry at Ms Shin I had no doubt that he applied substantial force in twisting her arm. I thought it common knowledge that when one twists a person’s arm forcefully one is likely to cause pain to that person, and so I had no hesitation inferring that the accused, being a rational adult, in fact knew this.

73     I therefore found that all the elements required to make out the offence of voluntarily causing hurt punishable under s 323 of the Penal Code (as set out at \[14\] above) had been established beyond a reasonable doubt in this case. I duly convicted the accused on the charge.

## Sentence

74     In sentencing the accused I was guided by the framework governing offences punishable under s 323 of the Penal Code set out in the High Court decision of _Low Song Chye v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 526</span> (“_Low Song Chye_”) at \[77\]–\[78\]. The framework prescribes “three broad sentencing bands providing indicative sentencing ranges based on the hurt caused by the offence”, as follows:

> (a)     Band 1 encompasses cases of “Low” harm with an indicative range of a fine or short custodial term up to four weeks’ imprisonment;

> (b)     Band 2 encompasses cases of “Moderate” harm with an indicative range of four weeks’ to six months’ imprisonment; and

> (c)     Band 3 encompasses cases of “Serious” harm with an indicative range of six to 24 months’ imprisonment.

75     But I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that these indicative sentencing ranges had to be adjusted arithmetically because at the time the offence in _Low Song Chye_ was committed the maximum sentence was two years’ imprisonment but this had been increased by 50% to three years’ imprisonment by the time the accused committed his offence on 26 September 2020. There had been no change to the definition of the offence, and so I thought that the conceptual underpinnings of the _Low Song Chye_ framework remained intact and the framework thus remained applicable, but given the well-established need to “have regard to the full breadth of the permitted sentencing range” (see _Low Song Chye_ at \[67\]), I considered that arithmetic adjustment was necessary to utilise the entire sentencing range up to three years’ imprisonment.

76     I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that the “legislative intent” behind the increase in the maximum sentence was for “general benchmarks for s 323 offences to be increased across the board”: Penal Code Review Committee, _Report_ (August 2018) at section 35, para 8. Given that Parliament in effect accepted the recommendation of the Penal Code Review Committee on this point I thought that Parliament could be said to have adopted that stated legislative intent. Bearing in mind this intent, it seemed to me that the indicative sentencing ranges in the _Low Song Chye_ framework ought to be increased “across the board” in proportionate and linear fashion. This would entail increasing by 50% the upper limit of the range for each sentencing band (and correspondingly the lower limit of the range for the next higher band). I therefore used the following indicative sentencing ranges:

> (a)     Band 1 – fine to six weeks’ imprisonment;

> (b)     Band 2 – six weeks’ to nine months’ imprisonment;

> (c)     Band 3 – nine to 36 months’ imprisonment.

77     I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that this case fell within Band 2. According to _Low Song Chye_, the “Moderate” harm contemplated within that band would include “hurt resulting in short hospitalisation or a substantial period of medical leave, simple fractures, or temporary or mild loss of a sensory function” (at \[77\]). It was apparent from the medical certificates in evidence (exhibit P6) that Ms Shin was placed on hospitalisation leave for a total of 50 days from 26 September 2020 to 16 November 2020 (excluding 3 and 4 October), and thereafter she was until 4 January 2021 deemed fit for “Light Duty” only. This was without question a very substantial period of medical leave that comfortably fit the description of “Moderate” harm.

78     When cross-examining the medical doctors in court, the accused seemed to insinuate that the doctors had erred in giving Ms Shin hospitalisation leave, in that they had done so even though she had not been kept overnight in the hospital at any time. I did not think there was any substance in this point. The accused relied on what appeared to be a print-out from the website of the Ministry of Manpower (exhibit D8), but I could not fathom how this document assisted him given that it envisaged that hospitalisation leave might be given to an employee who “requires rest or further medical treatment” even where that employee has been discharged from hospital. I accepted Dr Liao’s evidence that hospitalisation leave is not confined to situations in which the patient has to be hospitalised but extends to situations in which the patient has a “prolonged inability to go to work” (CT at Day 5 p 47 lines 25–27), and in Ms Shin’s case she was unable to work until 16 November 2020 because she required “total immobilisation with a splint” (CT at Day 5 p 48 lines 17–21).

79     Given also that Ms Shin’s TFCC injury took months to heal, it was clear that the injury was by no means a minor one. It could not possibly constitute “Low” harm such as to bring the case within Band 1 of the _Low Song Chye_ framework because that band was meant for injuries of a superficial nature such as scratches and lacerations. There could be no doubt that the degree of severity of Ms Shin’s TFCC injury went well beyond that.

80     The prosecution submitted that the indicative starting point in this case should be six weeks’ imprisonment. This was the lower limit of the range for Band 2 and I adopted it given that there existed no other position within that band that could possibly be more favourable to the accused. The prosecution then correctly pointed out that the _Low Song Chye_ framework was designed for offenders who pleaded guilty and that for offenders who claimed trial, as the accused had done, “\[a\]ppropriate calibrations” could be made to the indicative starting sentences (at \[77\]–\[78\]). The prosecution submitted that two months’ imprisonment should be imposed in this case.

81     I fully agreed with the prosecution’s characterisation of the accused as lacking in remorse. This was evident from his allegations that Ms Shin was feigning injury and seeking to malign and blackmail him, and that Ms Wang Ying and Ms Som were complicit in this scheme. Furthermore, the accused had no compunction casting entirely unwarranted aspersions on the prosecution and the police. For instance, in oral closing submissions, the accused said that there had been a “dereliction of duties” on the part of the police and the prosecution and even the medical doctors (CT at Day 8 p 21 lines 8–12), and that the prosecution had “misuse\[d\] the law” and participated in “a humiliation of the law” (CT at Day 8 p 23 line 1) and failed to act “in line with \[its\] mission as well as \[its\] work ethics” (CT at Day 8 p 27 line 32 to p 28 line 1). It was all too clear that the accused persistently refused to accept responsibility for his act of causing hurt to Ms Shin and sought instead to blame everyone else for his predicament in having to face criminal proceedings. All this meant that the accused should not be granted the measure of leniency generally afforded offenders who demonstrate genuine contrition in pleading guilty, and so I accepted that in principle an uplift to the indicative starting sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment would ordinarily be called for.

82     But as against this I was minded to give the accused some degree of allowance on account of two circumstances. First, I accepted that Ms Shin had contributed to the heated and emotionally fraught atmosphere during the incident by her own angry and aggressive behaviour, especially in her attempts to snatch the menu from the accused. Second, the accused’s offence consisted of a momentary and one-off act and there was no further physical contact between him and Ms Shin after that. Taking these circumstances together with the accused’s lack of criminal antecedents and his relatively advanced age – he was 62 years old at the time of the offence – I was prepared to believe that he was acting out of character in committing this offence and that he was unlikely to commit a similar offence in the future, meaning that there was no great need for specific deterrence.

83     With that in mind I did not think it was necessary to apply an uplift to the indicative starting sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment. Already this was not an insubstantial duration and I thought that it would adequately serve the purposes of retribution and deterrence.

84     The accused urged me not to impose a sentence of imprisonment on the ground that his health was poor. On the basis of medical documents that he produced I was satisfied that as of 23 December 2021 he had sustained a “recent” compression fracture of the L1 vertebral body in his spine, and that he would be on hospitalisation leave until 28 March 2022 and had follow-up medical appointments on 14 and 21 April 2022. But, taking guidance from the High Court decision of _Chew Soo Chun v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 2 SLR 78</span> at \[38\], I did not think that the accused’s physical condition reached the level of exceptionality required for the exercise of judicial mercy, and I also did not think that it was so unusual or unmanageable that it would cause imprisonment to have a disproportionate impact on him compared to able-bodied offenders of similar age. Hence I did not think the accused’s poor health was reason to reduce or modify the sentence and accordingly I imposed a sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment.

## Compensation

85     Given that the accused had caused Ms Shin’s right TFCC injury I thought it fair and appropriate that he should at least pay for the medical expenses that she incurred in having the injury examined and treated. From the invoices and receipts in evidence before me (exhibit P7) I was satisfied that Ms Shin had in that connection paid a total of $1,418.80 out of her own pocket. I duly ordered that the accused pay that sum to Ms Shin.
