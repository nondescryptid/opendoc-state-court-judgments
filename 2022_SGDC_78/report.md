Civil Procedure – Discontinuance – Reinstatement application

13 April 2022

### Deputy Registrar Kim Bumsoo:

1       The plaintiffs are brothers. The 1st Plaintiff (“**Sadiq**”) was injured in a road traffic accident on 6 April 2016. His claim is for the personal injuries sustained in the accident. The 2nd Plaintiff (“**Shafie**”) owned the motorbike that Sadiq was riding at the time of the accident. His claim is for damage to his motorbike. The suit was automatically discontinued on 24 November 2020 pursuant to O 21 r 2(8) of the Rules of Court 2014 (“**ROC**”). They filed DC/SUM 3803/2021 seeking to reinstate the suit. Having heard the parties and considered their suit, I dismissed their application.

2       This reinstatement application, while brought by both brothers, affected Sadiq more than Shafie. If Sadiq cannot have this claim reinstated, he is statutorily barred from bringing a fresh claim for his personal injuries. Presumably, that is why the brothers have brought an appeal against my decision.

## Facts

### Background to the dispute

3       In brief, the brothers:

> (a)     filed their claims in 2017;

> (b)     obtained interlocutory judgment in 2018; and

> (c)     filed their Affidavits of Evidence in Chief (“**AEICs**”) and Bundle of Documents (“**BODs**”) on 25 January 2019.

The last step in the proceedings was taken on 24 November 2019 when the Defendant filed a notice of change of solicitor. Thereafter, no further steps were taken by any party even though damages were yet to be assessed. The matter was automatically discontinued on 24 November 2020.

4       For the purposes of this application, there were three key facts.

5       First, Sadiq killed somebody whilst driving recklessly on 13 September 2018 (“**the 2018 Incident**”).[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) This was a different accident from the one that formed the subject matter of this suit. Sadiq said he was traumatised about having caused another person’s death. He sought to rely on this in explaining his inaction between _November 2019_ and _November 2020_. This is despite evidence that he had been capable of conducting his case from as early as in January 2019, when his AEIC and BOD were filed.

6       Second, in late 2018, there were some discussions between Sadiq, his ex-employer, and his ex-employer’s insurers (“**FCI**”) about how the damages received from this suit would be split between them. Those discussions carried on until 2020. Sadiq claimed that these discussions proved that he was actively working on his case throughout 2020. This is despite evidence that the matter had, for all intents and purposes, resolved by 17 August 2020[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) – the discussions stopped a full three months before the guillotine date on 24 November 2020.

7       Third, in 2020, criminal prosecution commenced for Sadiq’s role in the 2018 Incident. He claimed that these matters kept him from prosecuting his case effectively in 2020. This is despite the fact that he would have known the criminal consequences of his actions in 2018 and was involved in pre-trial conferences (“**PTCs**”) from as early as 1 July 2019 with seemingly no difficulty in conducting this lawsuit at the same time. Indeed, there was evidence that he was meeting with his solicitors as late as on 8 July 2020.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3)

## The legal principles

9       First, some definitions. O 21 r 2(8) of the ROC requires two dates to be ascertained: the trigger date, “the date of the last step in the action as it appears in the court records”, and the guillotine date, “the day before the anniversary of the trigger date”: _Moguntia-Est Epices S.A. v Sea-Hawk Freight Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 4 SLR(R) 429</span> (“**_Moguntia_**”) at \[20\]. Once the guillotine date passes without any step in the proceedings taken since the trigger date, the action is automatically discontinued.

10     Second, the applicable test. _Moguntia_ set out the three guidelines in determining whether a reinstatement application should be granted:

> (a)     has the plaintiff satisfied the court that he is innocent of any significant failure to conduct the case with expedition prior to the trigger date having regard to the particular features of the case. If he has not, then reinstatement should be refused (“**_Moguntia_****Guideline 1**”);

> (b)     has he satisfied the court that in all the circumstances his failure to take any step in the action since the trigger date (and this would include his failure to apply for an extension of time) is excusable, _ie_ should be forgiven? If he has not, then again reinstatement should be refused (“**_Moguntia_****Guideline 2**”);

> (c)     has the plaintiff satisfied the court that the balance of justice indicates that the action should be reinstated? If not, once again reinstatement should be refused.

11     Finally, the principles. Given the rationale of O 21 r 2(8) of the Rules of Court 2014 (“culling dormant suits and inducing plaintiffs to prosecute their actions with reasonable diligence”: _Moguntia_ at \[17\]), reinstatement applications will generally only be granted in exceptional circumstances: _Moguntia_ at \[21\]. Additionally, the first two steps in the _Moguntia_ guidelines “have to be satisfied before the court will consider the third”: _Singapore Civil Procedure 2021_ vol 1 (Cavinder Bull gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 2021) at para 21/5/16.

12     I found that neither of the first two _Moguntia_ Guidelines were satisfied.

## My decision

13     As a preliminary matter, Shafie simply had no case. He chose not to file any affidavit in support of the application. This was odd. Sadiq and Shafie were co-plaintiffs. This was a reinstatement application that affected both brothers and naturally, the court should have been given all the relevant information to make an assessment as to the merits of the case. Here, Shafie’s refusal to offer an affidavit completely cut out an entire party’s evidence on the matter. This was especially troubling since the two brothers were in qualitatively different positions and in considering this reinstatement application, I should have been given the evidence necessary to consider all the circumstances in their totality.

14     As I mentioned to the brothers’ counsel, all the reasons stated for this application were Sadiq’s. It would have been odd if Shafie could take the benefit of Sadiq’s reasons when those were not applicable to him. Notwithstanding this unfortunate state of affairs, I was not minded to grant the brothers a further opportunity to produce another affidavit from Shafie. This application had been adjourned multiple times already, and it was clear from the hearing that the brothers’ counsel (they were represented by the same firm) was fully aware of this issue and had instead chosen consciously not to file any affidavit from Shafie in support of this application. Shafie’s action in this application was a non-starter. I turn then to the Sadiq’s case proper.

## Moguntia **_Guideline 1_**

15     This stage of the inquiry concerned Sadiq’s conduct before the trigger date.

16     I accepted that Sadiq was innocent of any significant failure to conduct the case with expedition between the commencement of the action and 25 January 2019, when the brothers filed their AEICs and BOD. Prior to even interlocutory judgment being granted, Sadiq’s solicitors wrote to Tan Tock Seng Hospital on 27 August 2017, seeking an updated medical diagnosis. It appeared that the hospital took a long time to respond, providing a specialist medical report only on 13 August 2018. While the Defendant was right to point out that Sadiq took almost a year to file their AEIC and BOD after interlocutory judgment was granted (on 31 January 2018), I accepted that some time was required to study the medical report, gather further evidence (indeed Sadiq had changed jobs at least twice, by 2018)[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7) and compile this into a coherent AEIC.

17     I should clarify however, that my decision in this aspect was not influenced by Sadiq’s 2018 Incident and did not take into account the alleged trauma that resulted from it. There was nothing to suggest that the trauma was so debilitating that he could not have taken any steps to, at the very least, keep the matter “live”. The Institute of Mental Health (“**IMH**”) report produced for his criminal prosecution made no suggestion to that effect.[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8) In fact, Sadiq acknowledged in his own affidavit that he was “able to conduct \[his case\] and periodically give instructions”.[^9] It seemed that the trauma did not hinder him from prosecuting his case up to 25 January 2019, when the brothers’ AEICs and BOD were filed.

18     Even taking his case at its highest, it was difficult to take the trauma into consideration. Sadiq’s psychiatric reports showed that he had a history of psychiatric issues ranging from a Post-Concussion Syndrome (he was assaulted in 2009), to an Acute Stress Reaction during his National Service days. But the real question was whether these longstanding psychiatric issues excused his delay in prosecuting the present case. In that regard, I took the view that there had to be at least a demonstrable causal connection between these psychiatric issues and his ability to conduct his case with reasonable diligence. There was no evidence to that effect. On the contrary, he brought this claim in 2017 with no issue. And it appeared that he continued to be engaged in the case throughout the years, securing interlocutory judgment in 2018, and later filing his AEIC and BOD in 2019. Again, by his own evidence, it seems that the trauma did not cripple him or prevent some discussion of the case.

19     I turn then to the period between 25 January 2019 and the trigger date. Sadiq’s lack of action during that period was inexplicable. There was simply no explanation for what Sadiq (or even Shafie, for that matter) were doing between January 2019 and November 2019. And this was not simply an ordinary failure. It represented 10 months of unexplained indolence that materially contributed to the delay experienced. It was a crucial period for Sadiq. The bulk of the evidence to be relied on was available to all parties – parties which, I note, were fully represented in these proceedings. Settlement could have been an option. Negotiations should have been commenced. It would have been the simplest thing to seek further directions from the court, either by filing a notice of assessment of damages and receiving an indication about the possible damages that Sadiq might receive in this suit, or by seeking timelines with further extension as necessary. Instead, that crucial window of opportunity appears to have been wasted. It is no answer to point to the 2018 Incident as an excuse. As I stated earlier, the accident does not appear to have had a significant impact on Sadiq’s ability to conduct his case up till 25 January 2019, when the trauma would have been, presumably, fresher on Sadiq’s mind. All the more, I could not see how it could explain the lack of action **_after_** the AEICs/BOD were filed.

20     To my mind, this represented a significant failure to attend to the case with expedition and for that reason, this application therefore failed the first stage of the _Moguntia_ test.

## Moguntia **_Guideline 2_**

21     Though not strictly necessary, I turn then to Sadiq’s conduct since the trigger date of 24 November 2019. That is the period which _Moguntia_ Guideline 2 is concerned with. Sadiq offered five explanations. None of them were persuasive.

#### Sadiq’s First Explanation – COVID-19 Movement Controls

22     The first explanation was a generic reference to COVID-19 movement controls (“\[after\] March 2020, the COVID-19 movement controls were implemented. This had affected our daily lives and movements \[…\] After July 2020, I did not follow-up with my lawyers”).[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10) This was no excuse. In the very same paragraph where he brought up the COVID-19 difficulties, he acknowledged that he was still in contact with his lawyers during that period, going so far as to meet them in July 2020.[^11] These were, in other words, not serious explanations for the lapses that form the subject of these proceedings.

23     In any case, COVID-19 cannot be a catch-all justification for any and all procedural lapses, much less those involving year-long defaults. It behoves an applicant to explain with at least reasonable specificity how COVID-19 affected his ability to prosecute his case effectively. A general reference to “movement restrictions” is not enough. An abstract reference to difficulties associated with the pandemic will not suffice. As sympathetic as I was to the fact that COVID-19 is an unprecedented pandemic, and even as I understood that a pandemic experienced by all may affect certain individuals more than others, I could not simply speculate about such things without better evidence. Sadiq bears that burden of proof, and I was not satisfied with their simple references to COVID-19 movement controls.

#### Sadiq’s Second Explanation – Trauma from the 2018 Incident

24     Sadiq’s affidavit described his trauma from the 2018 Incident, suggesting that he was incapable of conducting his case with reasonable diligence. I was initially sympathetic to this explanation. But upon examination of his actions and the relevant timelines, the facts did not add up. The incident happened in 2018. The period of delay was in 2020. And as stated earlier, it was unclear how exactly that trauma effected his ability to conduct his case. The IMH report did not assist him[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12) and to the contrary, it stated that he was fit to plead. Sadiq himself acknowledged that he was “able to conduct \[his case\] and periodically give instructions”.[^13] The evidence did not suggest that treatment was extensive either. In fact, Sadiq was not undergoing any sort of treatment plan till 9 December 2020 (_ie, after_ the guillotine date), much less an “eventful” one of the sort that excused the plaintiff in _Kim Seong Mo v Securiforce Sdn Bhd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 297</span>. It is difficult to see how either the trauma or its treatment could have hampered his ability to conduct his case.

25     When this was raised to counsel, I was urged to take Sadiq’s word that there had indeed been continuing psychological difficulties for him in carrying conducting this case. Anything else, it was suggested, was speculative. But the evidence betrayed Sadiq. There were many instances since 13 September 2018 (the date of the 2018 Incident) where he demonstrated both ability and willingness to pursue this case. For some reason however, no step was taken in the proceedings and no explanation was offered for why the matter was allowed to fall into neglect.

#### Sadiq’s Third Explanation – Criminal Prosecution for the 2018 Incident

26     Sadiq also pointed to his criminal prosecution for the 2018 Incident, relying on it to excuse his inaction between 25 November 2019 and 24 November 2020. Again, I was initially sympathetic to this but ultimately found that the evidence could not support Sadiq’s explanations:

27     First, it was clear that he had been capable of both attending to his criminal prosecution and conducting this case at the same time. He first came before the Court on 10 April 2019.[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14) His last PTC was on 27 November 2020. Despite the ongoing criminal prosecution, he was capable of and did in fact meet with his solicitors about the present case in February and July 2020.[^15] In that regard it was hard to believe that his criminal prosecution had hampered him from attending to this case. If he had been speaking to his solicitors, the question then turned to why none of that translated into an actual step in the proceedings. Again, there was no explanation forthcoming.

28     Second, his solicitors could not credibly explain why Sadiq had not been advised of the impending guillotine date. Sadiq’s counsel explained at the hearing that he did not know of Sadiq’s criminal prosecution until after Sadiq had been released from prison. But that missed the point. The clock started running on 24 November 2019. The guillotine date was approaching on 24 November 2020, months before any imprisonment and way before his eventual plead guilty mention on 26 July 2021. There was, in other words, ample time before his imprisonment for his counsel to have advised him of the possibility of automatic discontinuance. Sadiq’s counsel further explained that he “\[relied\] on \[Sadiq\] to periodically check with \[him\] on the progress of \[Sadiq’s case\]”.[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16) Accordingly, when Sadiq stopped updating his solicitors, the matter fell into neglect. But that is really no explanation at all. It is Sadiq’s solicitors who should have informed him that there were further steps which had to be taken. The guillotine date was approaching in three months when Sadiq last saw his solicitors on 8 July 2020. There was ample time for the solicitors to advise Sadiq, take instructions and ultimately prevent the automatic discontinuance. That was not done.

#### Sadiq’s Fourth Explanation – “developing evidence”

29     Sadiq also submitted that he had been “developing evidence on his injuries”.[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17) I noted in my oral judgment that this was a bare submission not backed up by any affidavit evidence. And even on the most cursory perusal of this case’s procedural history, there was no proof that this was true. The evidence had already been compiled by the trigger date. The AEICs and BOD were filed. I could not see what evidence Sadiq could possibly have been compiling in the meantime. There was certainly no suggestion of any new medical report sought or any kind of settlement negotiation with the Defendant after the trigger date. Even if there had been preparatory steps taken as Sadiq suggests, none of those matured into actual steps in the proceedings. There was no explanation offered for why that was the case either.

#### Sadiq’s Fifth Explanation – FCI discussions

30     Sadiq’s final explanation was that he was mired in discussions with FCI about how the damages from this suit was to be sorted out between him, his ex-employer, and FCI.[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18) That may be true. But all this only suggested to me that Sadiq was perfectly capable of giving instructions and had a set of solicitors who were vigorously advancing his interests at that time (see for example, the letter dated 17 August 2020).[^19] If so, that made the complete radio silence in this suit even more inexcusable, especially since all it would have taken would have been for the solicitors to write to court seeking an extension of time.

31     Moreover, I could not see how Sadiq’s negotiations with FCI – a non-party in these proceedings – excused his conduct in _these_ proceedings with the defendant. Those arrangements he was brokering with FCI were related to this suit, yes. But they were ultimately a separate issue and should not have hampered the prosecution of this case with reasonable diligence. The best that could be said was that FCI’s position on the matter could affect whether Sadiq would claim for medical bills and pre-trial loss of income against the Defendant. This was the explanation offered by counsel in the hearing as well. But that was a matter raised as early as 28 December 2018[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20) and which appeared to have been resolved when FCI’s solicitors stopped pursuing the matter after the letter sent on 17 August 2020.[^21] These FCI discussions, in other words, were at best only credible explanations for the delay till 17 August 2020.

32     A perhaps subtler argument (alluded to in \[15\] and \[20\]–\[23\] of Sadiq’s submissions dated 18 January 2022) is that the rule in O 21 r 2(6) of the ROC really seeks to address a specific mischief: dilatory case management. Having shown continued efforts to engage with this case, Sadiq ought to have his claim reinstated, so the argument goes. While I agreed with this argument in principle, I did not think it applied on the present facts. There were at least two periods of time where there was no evidence of anything being done at all. These were:

> (a)     between the trigger date and 16 June 2020 (the date when FCI’s solicitors appear to have sent a chaser about FCI’s concerns); and

> (b)     between 17 August 2020 (the date when correspondence with FCI appears to have stopped) and the guillotine date.

33     The best that could have been said was that criminal proceedings were afoot in 2020. But as I’ve explained above, those were not credible explanations for the delay.

#### The totality argument

34     Quite separately from the five discrete explanations raised above, a further argument was alluded to in the hearing. The suggestion was that when all these factors were taken in their totality, they were greater than the sum of their parts. The accident bled into the trauma. And the trauma bled into conduct of the case. All these had to be assessed against the background of COVID-19 and an impending criminal prosecution. However, I was ultimately not persuaded that the totality of the circumstances could warrant a reinstatement.

35     These matters were eminently within Sadiq’s knowledge and perfectly foreseeable. Criminal proceedings were a possibility as early as 2018. His psychiatric condition stretched back to his National Service days. The FCI issues were live even back in 2018. There was ample knowledge of these events early on and ample time to address them. They were not. And that, in my view, was the crux of this matter. Sadiq has had a series of incredible misfortunes – misfortunes more than most. But he was also in some sense, given more time than most to address them. In the circumstances, it was inexcusable for him to have let this matter fall to the side.

36     For these reasons, I held that Sadiq has failed at the second stage of the _Moguntia_ guidelines as well. Having held that the application has failed on both the first and second stage, it was unnecessary for me to go into detail about the third stage of the _Moguntia_ guidelines. I would only comment that interlocutory had already been entered and all that remained was for quantum to be assessed. If the failures and delays had been excusable, I would have been minded to agree with the brothers that a reinstatement would have been profitable. There was no prejudice in the defendant supposedly “losing” a limitation defence. That sort of argument was already convincingly dismissed in _Ng Ah Lay_ (at \[16\]) and I was inclined to agree with the learned District Judge on that score.

### Costs

37     Costs wise, I took the counsel up on their invitation to fix costs for both the application and the proceedings as a whole.

> (a)     For the application itself, I awarded a single sum of $2,500 (exclusive of GST and disbursements), given the factual and legal complexity of the matter, the fact that Shafie appeared to be a nominal plaintiff at best, and the work done for this matter. I ordered these costs to be borne by Sadiq.

> (b)     For the proceedings, I fixed costs payable by Sadiq to the Defendant at $4,000 (exclusive of GST and disbursements) considering the work involved (especially those involving liaising with external parties), the complexity of this matter and the fact that the Defendant had already acknowledged liability in this matter. As for costs payable by Shafie to the Defendant, I fixed costs at $500 (exclusive of GST and disbursements), bearing in mind the nature of Shafie’s claim, the fact that interlocutory judgment had already been entered and liability had been admitted by the Defendant, and the work done in preparation for contesting Shafie’s claim.

## Conclusion

38     Ultimately, this case boiled down to whether a plaintiff had successfully proven that the various misfortunes visited on him could explain his delays/failures. The misfortunes themselves were diverse and heart-wrenching. And it was especially difficult to leave discontinued an application that appeared otherwise, to be a perfectly good one. But the law makes it clear that reinstatement applications are rarely granted. This remained true especially when the evidence simply could not support the assertions advanced by the plaintiff.
