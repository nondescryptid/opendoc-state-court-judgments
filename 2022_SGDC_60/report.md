Landlord and Tenant – Recovery of possession

Contract – Waiver

Contract – Remedies – Damages – Causation

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in HC/DCA 5/2022.\]

28 March 2022

### District Judge Lim Wee Ming:

## Introduction

1       The plaintiff claims that the defendant breached the tenancy agreement between them, by wrongfully re-entering the premises tenanted to the plaintiff. The defendant has counterclaims for misrepresentation, nuisance and trespass. The defendant also has a counterclaim against Gabriel Lim Wei Quan (“Gabriel Lim”), the managing director of the plaintiff, for the corporate veil to be lifted, so that Gabriel Lim, is personally liable for the counterclaims against the plaintiff.

2       I dismissed the plaintiff’s claims and the defendant’s counterclaims. The plaintiff has appealed against my decision. The defendant has not appealed.

## Facts

3       The plaintiff is engaged in the cryptocurrency business, including cryptocurrency mining. Gabriel Lim is the managing director and majority shareholder of the plaintiff. According to Gabriel Lim, between 13 March 2018 to 1 March 2019, his friend, Ng Cheong Jie (“Mr Ng”), was his business partner in the plaintiff.[^1]

4       The defendant is in the business of letting and operating real estate. The director of the defendant is Yap Kah Seng (“Mr Yap”).

5       The defendant is the owner of the property known as 196 Pandan Loop #07-21 Pantech Business Hub. The aforesaid unit #07-21 was subdivided into eight rooms, labelled Suites 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.[^2]

### Tenancy agreement – written consent for renovations

6       The plaintiff and the defendant entered into a tenancy agreement dated 29 March 2018 (“the Tenancy Agreement”), wherein the defendant let to the plaintiff Suites 3 and 5 (“the Premises”), for a term of 24 months at a monthly rent of $900 for the first year and $1,100 for the second year.[^3]

7       Mr Poon Yau Loy (“Mr Poon”), the defendant’s real estate agent, dealt with the plaintiff on behalf of the defendant.

8       According to Mr Poon, before the Tenancy Agreement was entered into, Gabriel Lim informed Mr Poon that the plaintiff was in the trading business.[^4] However, according to Gabriel Lim, he had informed Mr Poon that the plaintiff was in the IT business.[^5]

9       The Tenancy Agreement requires the defendant’s written consent for renovations to the Premises. Clause 2(iv) of the Tenancy Agreement states that the plaintiff covenants with the defendant as follows:

> Not to make any alterations, additions or structural alterations in the Demised Premises without the previous written consent of the Landlord. No alterations, renovation works or fitting out works prior to the commencement of tenancy (“the Works”) shall be carried out at the Demised Premises unless the plans and drawings in respect of the Works have been first submitted to the Landlord and the Landlord has given his consent in writing to the Works and the Tenant has complied with any conditions that may be imposed by the Landlord in giving such consent. …

10     The plaintiff wished to remove the aforesaid provision in clause 2(iv) but the defendant did not agree to this. The aforesaid provision remained in the Tenancy Agreement that was signed between the parties.

### Renovations to bypass the circuit breakers

11     Gabriel Lim states in paragraph 49 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) that he had informed Mr Poon of the following proposed renovations:

> (a)     The installation of ventilation fans.

> (b)     The construction of partition walls.

> (c)     The connection of additional electrical wiring and power sockets around the Premises.

> (d)     The installation of additional Ethernet ports around the Premises.

12     According to Gabriel Lim, Mr Poon assured him that the defendant was “fully aware of \[the plaintiff’s\] proposed renovation works set out at paragraph 49 \[of Gabriel Lim’s AEIC\] and had no issues with them.”[^6]

13     On 2 April 2018, the plaintiff commenced renovation works.[^7] The renovations included the installation of electrical components to the defendant’s distribution board box (“DB Box”) to bypass the circuit breakers of the DB Box, which was outside the Premises. This enabled the plaintiff to operate the mining rigs on the Premises for its cryptocurrency mining business.

14     According to Gabriel Lim:

> (a)     On 3 April 2018, Mr Poon’s assistant, Ms Owyong, dropped by the Premises and had no comment on the renovations.[^8]

> (b)     On 20 April 2018, Ms Owyong inspected the completed renovation works including the mining rigs and did not comment on them, save that they “were looking good”.[^9]

15     On 24 and 25 April 2018, Mr Poon sent messages to Gabriel Lim, raising issues with a humming noise and the electrical consumption at the Premises.[^10] Mr Poon again raised the high electrical consumption issue in a message to Gabriel Lim of 27 April 2018. In the same message, Mr Poon stated “We rented the place to u with the understanding that u r using it as an office.”[^11] There was no reply from Gabriel Lim to dispute this.

16     On 11 May 2018, Mr Poon called Gabriel Lim to raise the issue of electricity consumption again. Gabriel Lim proposed that the defendant subscribe to an alternative electrical services package that provided lower electrical tariffs and that there be a meeting with the defendant to discuss the issue. [^12]

### Defendant’s repossession of the Premises

17     On 12 May 2018, the defendant re-entered the Premises without notifying the plaintiff.[^13] According to Mr Yap, he noticed an “abnormally high ambient temperature and a pervasive burnt odour in the air”.[^14] He discovered that the electrical wires to the Premises had been re-wired to bypass the DB Box circuit breakers.[^15] The electricity to the Premises was turned off and an electrician was engaged to remove the plaintiff’s electrical components from the DB Box.[^16]

18     On 14 May 2018, the defendant replaced the digital lock on the main door of unit #07-21 with a manual lock.[^17] Effectively, this prevented the plaintiff from entering the Premises.

19     After the defendant re-entered the Premises, there was a meeting on 15 May 2018 between Gabriel Lim, Mr Yap, his wife and Mr Poon. According to Gabriel Lim, the meeting was “to discuss the events that had transpired since 12 May 2018”.[^18] Gabriel Lim recorded the entire meeting, and a transcript of the meeting was produced at the trial.

20     The parties were unable to resolve their differences at the meeting. The plaintiff commenced the action herein against the defendant on 17 May 2018. The plaintiff applied for an interim injunction against the defendant for the defendant to be restrained from evicting the plaintiff from the Premises. At a hearing of the application on 25 May 2018, the application was dismissed.[^19] Thereafter, the matter proceeded for trial in 2021.

## Parties’ positions

21     The plaintiff’s claim against the defendant is for breach of the covenant for quiet enjoyment, in that on or about 12 May 2018, the defendant had wrongfully re-entered the Premises without notifying the plaintiff, contrary to section 18 of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap 61, 1994 Rev Ed) (“CLPA”).[^20] It is not disputed that the requisite notice under section 18 of the CLPA was not given.

22     The defendant has pleaded that the plaintiff was in breach of clause 2(iv) (“the Written Consent Clause”) of the Tenancy Agreement in that the plaintiff had without the defendant’s consent:

> (a)     Carried out electrical wiring works at the Premises.

> (b)     Installed two unauthorised electrical components to the DB Box to bypass the circuit breakers of the DB Box.[^21]

23     It is not disputed that the plaintiff had installed electrical components to bypass the circuit breakers of the DB Box. In the plaintiff’s reply submissions, the plaintiff refers to “the Plaintiff’s electrical components from the Main DB Box.”[^22] In the expert witness report of Wong Liang Toon, the licensed electrical technician instructed by the plaintiff, he states that “Shiki’s electrical wiring works caused the electrical supply to the Premises to be drawn directly from the MB \[Main Breaker\] without passing through the RCCB \[Residual Current Circuit Breaker\] in the Main Distribution Board.”[^23]

24     The plaintiff’s position is that it had specifically asked Mr Poon on multiple occasions whether consent was required and was repeatedly assured by Mr Poon that the defendant was very “easygoing”, that verbal consent was sufficient, and that the defendant had waived the Written Consent Clause.[^24]

25     The plaintiff submits that the real reason for the defendant’s re-entry was that the defendant was unhappy with the high electricity bill it received on 11 May 2018, prior to the re-entry on 12 May 2018.[^25] Under the Tenancy Agreement, the electricity bills incurred at the Premises were to be borne by the defendant.

26     The defendant has a counterclaim against the plaintiff for misrepresentation, nuisance and trespass. The defendant also has a counterclaim against Gabriel Lim for the aforesaid claims, on the basis that the corporate veil of the plaintiff may be lifted.

## Issues relating to the plaintiff’s claim

27     The main issues relating to the plaintiff’s claim are as follows:

> (a)     Whether the defendant had waived the Written Consent Clause.

> (b)     Whether the defendant should have given the requisite notice under section 18 of the CLPA.

> (c)     Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the damages that it is claiming.

## Plaintiff’s claim

28     In relation to the plaintiff’s claim, my findings are:

> (a)     The defendant had not waived the Written Consent Clause in relation to the installation of electrical components to bypass the circuit breakers of the DB Box.

> (b)     The defendant had wrongfully re-entered the Premises, in failing to give the requisite notice under section 18 of the CLPA.

> (c)     The plaintiff has failed to prove the damages it suffered as a result of the defendant wrongfully re-entering the Premises.

### The defendant had not waived the Written Consent Clause

29     In _Audi Construction Pte Ltd v Kian Hiap Construction Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 317</span> at \[57\], the Court of Appeal held that waiver by estoppel refers to the doctrine of equitable estoppel, and requires an “unequivocal representation by one party that he will not insist upon his legal rights against the other party, and such reliance by the representee as will render it inequitable for the representor to go back upon his representation”.

30     I find that there was no waiver of the Written Consent Clause in relation to the installation of electrical components to bypass the circuit breakers of the DB Box. The evidence from the defendant’s Gabriel Lim and Mr Ng do not support such a waiver.

31     Gabriel Lim states in his AEIC that he had informed Mr Poon of the following proposed renovations:

> (a)     The installation of ventilation fans.

> (b)     The construction of partition walls.

> (c)     The connection of additional electrical wiring and power sockets around the Premises.

> (d)     The installation of additional Ethernet ports around the Premises.[^26]

32     Mr Ng states in his AEIC that “We informed Mr Poon that Shiki intended to make a few renovations to the Premises. These renovations included the installation of ventilation fans, the erection of partitioning walls, and the installing of electrical wiring, additional power sockets and Ethernet switches at the Premises.”[^27]

33     From the AEICs of Gabriel Lim and Mr Ng, it does not appear that Mr Poon was informed of the installation of electrical components to bypass the circuit breakers of the DB Box.

34     The DB Box (which the plaintiff has described as the Main Distribution Board) is not within Suites 3 and 5 that were leased to the plaintiff.[^28] Accordingly, even if Mr Poon had consented to additional electrical wiring, this cannot extend to the installation of electrical components to bypass the circuit breakers of the DB Box that was not even within the Premises leased to the plaintiff. There was no unequivocal representation by Mr Poon that would give rise to such a broad waiver, that would cover the plaintiff’s electrical wiring works carried out on the DB Box that was not even on the leased Premises.

35     Furthermore, it is clear from the transcript of the meeting on 15 May 2018 that Gabriel Lim had been deliberately vague in using the word “renovation”. In that meeting with Mr Yap, his wife and Mr Poon, Gabriel Lim repeatedly stated that “‘Renovation’ is a very general word.”[^29] When Mr Poon accused Gabriel Lim that “You never even tell me anything about electrical”, Gabriel Lim did not dispute this but merely replied, “I said renovation, very general way.”[^30]

36     It is clear from this extract that Gabriel Lim had been deliberately vague in his earlier conversation with Mr Poon on the scope of the renovations and was seeking to rely on that, at the 15 May 2018 meeting. Such a general and vague reference to the word “renovation” certainly cannot cover electrical works that are not even within the Premises leased to the plaintiff. It cannot give rise to an “unequivocal representation” required for a waiver by estoppel.

37     Gabriel Lim claimed that he was at the meeting “to resolve matters, not to discuss about what renovation really means”.[^31] I am unable to accept Gabriel Lim’s explanation. As Gabriel Lim came to the meeting with a recording device and recorded the entire meeting,[^32] his intention clearly went beyond resolving matters. In that context, if Gabriel Lim had in fact informed Mr Poon of the electrical works at the DB Box, when Mr Poon confronted Gabriel Lim that “You never even tell me anything about electrical”, there would be no reason for Gabriel Lim not to dispute this, rather than merely replying “I said renovation, very general way.”

38     In cross-examination, Gabriel Lim’s evidence on whether he told Mr Poon about the plaintiff’s intended works to the DB Box was inconsistent in that:

> (a)     Gabriel Lim claimed that Mr Poon ought to have known about the intended works to the DB Box because Gabriel Lim had looked at the DB Box when Mr Poon was at the Premises.[^33] Gabriel Lim accepted that he did not expressly inform Mr Poon about the plaintiff’s intended works to the DB Box,[^34] but claimed that by referring to the installation of additional power sockets and wiring, it would be logical that they would have to be connected to the DB Box.[^35] However, this is entirely different from installing electrical components to bypass the circuit breakers in the DB Box.

> (b)     Gabriel Lim further claimed there was no alteration to the DB Box, but that it was merely an extension.[^36] This is contrary to the evidence of the plaintiff’s own expert, whose report stated that “Shiki’s electrical wiring works caused the electrical supply to the Premises to be drawn directly from the MB \[Main Breaker\] without passing through the RCCB \[Residual Current Circuit Breaker\] in the Main Distribution Board.” [^37]

39     I am of the view that Gabriel Lim’s aforesaid evidence in cross-examination is further evidence of his prevarication on the plaintiff’s proposed renovation works. This reinforces my view that there was no unequivocal representation from the defendant that the plaintiff could bypass the circuit breakers in the DB Box.

40     I further note that the evidence of the plaintiff’s expert, Wong Liang Toon, is that:

> (a)     “There would only be one utility account for the entire Unit #07-21, which would have been in the Landlord’s name at the material time”,[^38] and

> (b)     “it was for the Landlord to seek the necessary approvals for the electrical installation works.”[^39]

41     In the light of this, it follows that the plaintiff would have to expressly inform the defendant of the electrical works it intended to carry out to bypass the circuit breakers of the DB Box, before the defendant would be in a position to seek the necessary approvals. There is no evidence that the plaintiff expressly informed the defendant of this. A mere general reference to “renovation” or even “additional electrical wiring” by the plaintiff, would not suffice. This further points to there being no unequivocal representation from the defendant, allowing the plaintiff to bypass the circuit breakers in the DB Box.

42     The plaintiff has submitted “That the Defendant was aware of the scope of the Plaintiff’s renovations and had consented to it is further evidenced by Ms Owyong’s attendance at the Premises on 20 April 2018.”[^40] I am unable to agree with this submission. There is no evidence that Ms Owyong was even aware of the plaintiff’s installation of electrical components to bypass the circuit breakers of the DB Box that was outside the Premises. Accordingly, I am of the view that there is nothing arising from Ms Owyong’s attendance at the Premises on 20 April 2018, that supports the plaintiff’s case.

43     In the light of the aforesaid reasons, I find that there was no waiver of the Written Consent Clause, in so far as the installation of electrical components to bypass the circuit breakers of the DB Box is concerned. The plaintiff is in breach of the Written Consent Clause by installing the electrical components to bypass the circuit breakers of the DB Box without obtaining the written consent of the defendant.

### The defendant had wrongfully re-entered the Premises

44     Section 18(1) of the CLPA provides that:

> A right of re-entry or forfeiture under any provision or stipulation in a lease, for a breach of any covenant or condition in a lease, shall not be enforceable, by action or otherwise, unless the lessor serves on the lessee a notice specifying the particular breach complained of and, if the breach is capable of remedy, requiring the lessee to remedy the breach, and, in any case, requiring the lessee to make compensation in money for the breach, and the lessee fails, within a reasonable time thereafter, to remedy the breach, if it is capable of remedy, and to make reasonable compensation in money, to the satisfaction of the lessor, for the breach.

45     The plaintiff’s case is that the defendant had wrongfully re-entered the Premises without notifying the plaintiff, contrary to section 18 of the CLPA. The plaintiff relies on the High Court decision of _Ritzland Investment Pte Ltd v Grace Management & Consultancy Services Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 1342</span> (“_Ritzland_”) at \[99\] which held that “rules of … relief against forfeiture … continue to apply” even when the tenant is in repudiatory breach.

46     In the light of the aforesaid decision in _Ritzland_, I agree with the plaintiff’s case that the defendant had wrongfully re-entered the Premises without notifying the plaintiff.

### The plaintiff has failed to prove its claim for damages

47     The issue then is whether the plaintiff is entitled to its claim for damages against the defendant for wrongfully re-entering the Premises.

48     The plaintiff has claimed the following heads of loss:

> (a)     Losses arising from the defendant’s wrongful re-entry.

> (b)     Losses incurred as a result of the plaintiff’s relocation to new premises.

> (c)     Losses arising from the plaintiff’s inability to operate its business following the defendant’s breach.

49     In relation to the plaintiff’s claim for relocation losses, these relate to:

> (a)     the additional charges involved in leasing the new premises,

> (b)     duplicative expenses in setting up the new premises, and

> (c)     damages for inconvenience in relocating to the new premises.[^41]

50     In relation to the plaintiff’s claim for losses arising from being unable to operate its business following the defendant’s re-entry onto the Premises, the plaintiff is seeking loss of income for the disruption in the plaintiff’s business until it resumed operations at its new premises on 2 July 2018.[^42] The plaintiff claims that it suffered losses in the following income streams:

> (a)     mining rig hosting services,

> (b)     mining rig repair and optimisation services,

> (c)     sales of cryptocurrency mining rigs, and

> (d)     cryptocurrency mining losses.[^43]

51     In relation to the plaintiff’s claim for relocation losses and losses from the plaintiff’s inability to operate its business, I am unable to accept the plaintiff’s claim for such losses, as these would have been incurred even if the defendant had given the notice required under section 18 of the CLPA.

52     In _Sunny Metal & Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng Khim Ming Eric_ \[2007\] 3 SLR (R) 782, the Court of Appeal held that “to determine whether an act or omission was a cause of the loss, eliminate the act or omission mentally and consider whether or not the loss would still have occurred. … If the loss would still have occurred, even when the act or omission in question is disregarded, the loss has not been caused by this act or omission” (at \[64\]).

53     In the present case, if the defendant had given the required notice, the plaintiff would still have to vacate the Premises, as the plaintiff’s breach of the Tenancy Agreement in installing the electrical components to bypass the circuit breakers of the DB Box could not be rectified, as it would not have been possible for the plaintiff to carry out its business of cryptocurrency mining on the Premises, without bypassing the circuit breakers. The plaintiff had bypassed the circuit breakers in the DB Box, to enable it to carry out its cryptocurrency business on the Premises, and there is no evidence that the plaintiff could carry out its cryptocurrency business on the Premises, without bypassing the circuit breakers.

54     In the premises, I find that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover its relocation losses and losses from the plaintiff’s inability to operate its business, as these would have been incurred even if the defendant had given the requisite notice under section 18 of the CLPA. The plaintiff cannot be in a better position, than that if the requisite notice had been given.

55     As for the plaintiff’s claim for losses arising from the defendant’s wrongful re-entry, there were the following two heads of claim:

> (a)     Equipment that was damaged when the defendant switched off the main power supply when it re-entered the Premises causing damage to the plaintiff’s equipment. The plaintiff claims the sum of $7,808, as the cost of replacing the damaged equipment.[^44]

> (b)     Cost of re-installing the electrical components at the DB Box after these components had been removed by the defendant, but before the defendant changed the lock to the main door of unit #07-21. The plaintiff claims the sum of $428 for this item.

56     In relation to the plaintiff’s claim for $7,808 for the cost of replacing the damaged equipment,[^45] the defendant has pointed out that although the plaintiff has produced a quotation in support of its claim, no invoice has been produced.[^46] The equipment was purportedly damaged when the Premises were re-entered on 12 May 2018 and it would be reasonable to expect the equipment to have been replaced shortly after that, well before the trial in 2021. There is no good reason why the plaintiff has only produced a quotation, but no invoice to support his claim. Accordingly, I am unable to allow the plaintiff’s claim for the cost of replacing the damaged equipment.

57     As for the plaintiff’s claim for $428 to re-install the electrical components at the DB Box, no invoice or receipts have been produced in support of this claim. In the premises, I am unable to allow the plaintiff’s claim for the cost of re-installing the electrical components.

58     Furthermore, a fundamental difficulty with the plaintiff’s claim for loss of income and the plaintiff’s claim to re-install the electrical components, is that to allow these claims would effectively be allowing the plaintiff to make a claim for damages that is premised on its continued breach of the Tenancy Agreement, in bypassing the circuit breakers in the DB Box outside the Premises without the defendant’s consent. The plaintiff cannot found its claim on its own continued breach of the Tenancy Agreement. There is no rational basis to allow such a claim. This is a further ground for disallowing these claims.

59     In the light of the aforesaid reasons, I am not satisfied that the plaintiff has proven its claims for damages against the defendant. Accordingly, the plaintiff’s claims were dismissed.

## Defendant’s counterclaims

60     The defendant has counterclaims against the plaintiff for misrepresentation, nuisance and trespass. The aforesaid counterclaims are also made against Gabriel Lim personally, on the basis that the plaintiff’s corporate veil may be lifted.

61     As I have mentioned earlier, I dismissed the defendant’s counterclaims and there is no appeal by the defendant. The oral grounds which I gave for dismissing the defendant’s counterclaims are set out below.

62     In relation to the defendant’s counterclaim that the plaintiff had on or about 13 March 2018 misrepresented that it was in the trading business,[^47] I am unable to accept this. In cross-examination, Mr Poon agreed that Gabriel Lim’s message of 12 March 2018 that he was “planning to start another business”,[^48] meant that it was a different business from that of trading that Mr Poon was told about in December 2017.[^49] In the circumstances, I find that there was no misrepresentation that the plaintiff was in the trading business.

63     Furthermore, I agree with the plaintiff that there was no rescission for misrepresentation. Mr Yap’s evidence that he had rescinded the tenancy agreement appeared contrived as it was clear from his evidence that he did not know the meaning of the word despite using it repeatedly.[^50] In the premises, the defendant’s counterclaim for misrepresentation is dismissed.

64     In relation to the defendant’s counterclaim for nuisance and trespass to land, the defendant does not appear to be seriously pursuing this as the defendant merely states in its closing submissions in relation to this claim (at \[70.2\]), that “we repeat the submission made in our Opening Statement”. Furthermore, the defendant has not quantified its counterclaim for nuisance and trespass. In the premises, the defendant’s counterclaim for nuisance and trespass is dismissed.

65     As for the defendant’s counterclaim to lift the corporate veil, the defendant claims that the plaintiff “was set up to perpetuate a fraudulent facade to rent the Premises from the \[defendant\]”.[^51] The defendant relies on the plaintiff not having a corporate bank account and depositing its earnings into the personal bank accounts of Gabriel Lim and Mr Ng in support of its counterclaim to lift the corporate veil.[^52]

66     However, the defendant’s pleaded case is that the plaintiff “was set up to perpetuate a fraudulent facade to rent the Premises from the \[defendant\]”.[^53] The defendant’s pleaded case is very specific that the plaintiff was set up to perpetuate a fraud against the defendant. The fact that the plaintiff did not have a corporate account and deposited its earnings into the personal bank accounts of Gabriel Lim and Mr Ng on its own, does not establish such a fraud. I find that such a fraud against the defendant has not been established.

67     The defendant sought to rely on the Court of Appeal decision of _Alwie Handoyo v Tong Very Sumito_ (“_Alwie Handoyo_”) <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGCA 44</span> at \[96\], in support of its argument that the corporate veil should be lifted as the plaintiff was carrying on the business of its controller, Gabriel Lim. The plaintiff has submitted that _Alwie Handoyou_ may be distinguished.[^54] I agree with the plaintiff’s submission. In _Alwie Handoyo_, Alwie’s evidence was that “I am entitled to receive the money” (at \[98\]). In the present case, there is no such concession by Gabriel Lim that he was personally entitled to the money.

68     In any event, the lifting of the corporate veil would only be relevant if the defendant has a viable counterclaim for misrepresentation, nuisance, or trespass in the first place. In the light of my earlier findings in respect of these counterclaims, any claim against Gabriel Lim by lifting the corporate veil would fail as well.

69     In the premises, the defendant’s counterclaims were dismissed.

## Conclusion

70     In conclusion, both the plaintiff’s claims and the defendant’s counterclaims were dismissed. Parties were directed to write in for written submissions on costs, if they are unable to agree on costs.
