### District Judge Eddy Tham Tong Kong:

1       The Accused pleaded guilty before me to three charges, namely:

> DAC 905788/2019

> “… are charged that you, on or about 14 September 2018, at 2 Limau Walk, Singapore 467764, did arrange and plan a gathering of Reuben Chay Ser Zhe (male, 19 years old) (“Reuben”), Avinash Kapal Matani (male, 23 years old) (“Avinash”), Yong Zixian (male, 19 years old) (“Zixian”), Zackrie Bin Muhammad Kamaluddin (male, 20 years old) (“Zackrie”) and yourself, to wit:

>> (a)    by initiating a gathering for the purpose of consuming controlled drugs (“the gathering”);

>> (b) by inviting, via phone messages, Reuben and Avinash to join you for the gathering;

>> (c)    by informing Reuben and Avinash that the gathering was for the purpose of consuming controlled drugs;

>> (d)    by telling Reuben that you wanted to consume drugs with more persons, pursuant to such, Reuben invited Zixian to the gathering with your knowledge;

>> (e)    by directing Avinash to collect controlled drugs from Wan Dannial Farhan Bin Rhyme Poizee (“Dan”) for the purpose of consuming the drugs at the gathering;

>> (f)    by directing Dan to pass the controlled drugs to Avinash;

>> (g) by inviting Reuben, Avinash, Zixian and Zackrie to gather at the playground in the vicinity of 2 Limau Walk, Singapore 467764 (“the playground”); and

>> (h) by causing the controlled drugs to be brought to the playground,

> with the knowledge that controlled drugs were to be consumed at the gathering, and the gathering of Reuben, Avinash, Zixian, Zackrie and you was held on 15 September 2018 at or about 1.00 a.m., at the playground, without authorisation under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”) or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 11A(1) of the MDA.”;

> DAC 905799/2019

> “… are charged that you, on or before 15 September 2018, in Singapore, did consume a controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), to wit, 25B- NBOMe or any of its bromo, dimethoxy and methoxy positional isomers in the respective phenyl rings, without authorisation under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) or the regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 8(b)(i) of the said Act, punishable under Section 33(1) of the said Act.”; and

> DAC 911294/2019

> “… are charged that you, on or before 4 March 2019, in Singapore, did consume a Specified Drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), to wit, MDMA, without authorisation under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) or the regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) punishable under s 33(1) of the said Act.”

2       One more charge of consuming a specified drug, listed in the Fourth Schedule, namely, 11-Nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid, on the same date of 15 September 2018 as the charge in DAC 905799/2019, an offence under section 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (“MDA”), was taken into consideration.

3       I sentenced the Accused to 6 months of reformative training (“RT”).

4       The Accused being dissatisfied with the sentence has filed an appeal against it. The sentence has been stayed pending the outcome of this appeal and the Accused is currently on bail.

5       I now set out my grounds of decision for the sentence.

#### The Statement of Facts

6       The Accused is Jonas Andersen a 20-year-old, male Singaporean (D.O.B: 14 June 1999). He was a student of Temasek Polytechnic at the material time. The Accused resides at 2 Limau Walk, Singapore 467764 (the Accused’s residence).

7       The other parties involved in this case are as follows:

> a.     Yong Zixian (Deceased), a 19-year-old male Singaporean (“Zixian”). At the time of the offence, Zixian was a student studying Medicine at the National University of Singapore;

> b.     Reuben Chay Ser Zhe, a 19-year-old male Singaporean (“Reuben”). At the time of the offence, Reuben was serving his National Service with the Singapore Armed Forces;

> c.     Avinash Kirpal Mahtani, a 23-year-old male Singaporean (“Avinash”). At the time of the offence, Avinash was unemployed; and

> d.     Zackrie Bin Muhammad Kamaluddin, a 21-year-old male Singaporean(“Zackrie”). At the time of the offence, Zackrie was a student of Temasek Polytechnic.

8       On 15 September 2018 at about 12.35 p.m, as part of follow-up investigations for a coroner’s case pertaining to Zixian, officers from the Singapore Police Force visited the Accused’s residence. It was established that the Accused had gathered with four others, namely, Zixian, Reuben, Avinash and Zackrie at a playground in the vicinity of his residence for the consumption of controlled drugs. The Accused was thereafter placed under arrest for drug-related offences. The Accused was escorted to Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters for further investigations.

#### Facts pertaining to DAC-905788-2019

9       Investigations revealed that on 14 September 2018 at or about 11.43 pm, the Accused texted Reuben via phone messages to initiate a gathering for the purpose of ‘tripping’ together. ‘Trip’ was a slang word they used to refer to the act of consuming ‘acid’. The Accused stated that he wanted for more people to ‘trip’ together. Pursuant to this and with the Accused’s knowledge, Reuben invited Zixian to join in the gathering with the Accused for the purpose of consuming ‘acid’. Zixian agreed.

10     On 15 September 2018 at or about 12.17 am, the Accused texted Avinash via phone messages, inviting the latter to ‘trip’ together with friends. Avinash then invited Zackrie to join in the gathering for the purpose of tripping. Zackrie agreed.

11     Thereafter, the Accused instructed and arranged for Avinash to collect five tabs of 25B-NBOMe, which they referred to as ‘acid’, from a drug supplier known as Wan Dannial Farhan bin Rhyme Poizee, whom the Accused knows as ‘Dan’. The five tabs cost $200; the Accused had informed the members of the gathering about the price he paid, and expected them to cover their own share of the cost of the drugs. The Accused discussed with Avinash and came to the final arrangement where the Accused will grant Avinash a $5 discount for the latter’s purchase of one tab, in return for Avinash heading over to Blk 244, Simei Street 5, Singapore to collect the tabs from ‘Dan’. Separately, the Accused arranged for ‘Dan’ to head down to the foot of the said Blk 244. When Avinash informed the Accused that he was at the location, ‘Dan’ was directed to pass the five tabs to Avinash. After collecting the tabs from ‘Dan’, Avinash brought the tabs to the Accused’s residence for the purpose of consumption by members of the gathering.

12     On 15 September 2018 at or about 1 am, the Accused together with Zixian, Reuben, Avinash and Zackrie first met up at the Accused’s residence before proceeding to a playground in the vicinity of the Accused’s residence to consume controlled drugs. This was on the invitation of the Accused.

13     The Accused brought his own supply of ‘weed’ to the gathering. There, he rolled up the ‘weed’ (street name for cannabis and cannabis mixture), which he brought, into a joint with cigarette paper. He then lit up the joint of ‘weed’ and smoked a few puffs of it, and thereafter shared it with Reuben, Avinash and himself.

14     Then, the Accused, having received the five tabs of ‘acid’ from Avinash, distributed one tab each to Reuben, Avinash and Zixian. The Accused, Reuben, Avinash and Zixian then placed one tab of ‘acid’ under their respective tongues and left it there for a while. Thereafter, they swallowed it. The Accused claimed that he misplaced the last tab of ‘acid’. The group then returned to the room at the Accused’s residence.

15     Sometime after, Zixian was observed to be displaying unusual behaviour and fidgeting violently, such as hitting his hands and legs against the ground. An ambulance was called by the parents of the Accused. Later, on 15 September 2018 at about 5.44 am, Zixian was pronounced dead at Changi General Hospital. The cause of death was found to be 25B-NBOMe toxicity.

16     By virtue of the foregoing, Accused had arranged and planned a gathering where controlled drugs were to be consumed without authorization under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder and has thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 11A(1) of the MDA.

#### Facts pertaining to DAC-905799-2019

17     Following his arrest on 15 September 2018, the Accused provided two bottles of his urine samples which were then sent to the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) on 17 September 2018 for analysis.

18     The HSA subsequently issued two Certificates under Section 16 of the MDA, stating that on analysis, the said urine samples were found to contain 25B-NBOMe or any of its bromo, dimethoxy and methoxy positional isomers in the respective phenyl rings.

19     25B-NBOMe and its bromo, dimethoxy and methoxy positional isomers in the respective phenyl rings are Class A Controlled Drugs listed in the First Schedule to the MDA.

20     The Accused admits to having consumed one tab of 25B-NBOMe (‘acid’) as per \[14\] above. The Accused is not authorised under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to consume the said controlled drug and he has thereby committed an offence under Section 8(b)(i) of the MDA, punishable under Section 33(1) of the said Act.

#### Facts pertaining to DAC-911294-2019

21     On 4 March 2019 at about 8.32 am, whilst on Court bail, the Accused was arrested by officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) at his residence for the offence of consumption of a specified drug under s.8(b)(ii) of the MDA. The Accused was subsequently escorted back to CNB Bedok Division for further investigations.

22     Following his arrest on 4 March 2019, the Accused provided two bottles of his urine samples which were sent to the HSA on 05 March 2019 for analysis. The HSA subsequently issued two Certificates under Section 16 of the MDA stating that on analysis, the said urine samples were found to contain MDMA.

23     MDMA is a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA. The Accused admitted to the consumption of Ecstasy (street name for MDMA) tablet on 1 March 2019 at about 10 pm, orally. The Accused claimed he felt euphoric after consuming Ecstasy.

24     The Accused is not authorised under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to consume the said specified drug and he has thereby committed an offence under Section 8(b)(ii) of the MDA, punishable under Section 33(1) of the said Act.

#### Antecedent records

25     The Accused does not have any previous convictions.

#### Prosecution’s submissions

26     The Prosecution sought for the Accused to be sentenced to RT for the minimum period of 6 months based on the recommendation in the RT report that the Accused is suitable to undergo level 1 intensity of rehabilitation.

27     The Prosecution relied on the following factors as to why RT is more appropriate than probation:

> i.     the Accused committed a very serious offence of arranging and planning a gathering knowing that controlled drugs would be consumed which carries with it a minimum mandatory imprisonment of 3 years and the Accused is also liable for caning. It was further submitted that based on the aggravating factors present, if the Accused were to be sentenced as an adult, the appropriate length of sentence would have been at least 5 years;

> ii.     specific deterrence is needed here in view of the Accused reoffending with another drug consumption offence whilst on bail;

> iii.     there were aggravating factors present for the offence of arranging and planning a gathering for drug consumption:

>> a.       the Accused had extensive involvement. He was both the initiator and coordinator and had even paid one of the co-accused to collect drugs from the supplier. He then distributed drugs to all attendees at the gathering. This act would have constituted several counts of trafficking. He not only shared the controlled drug “acid” but also another controlled drug in the form of “rolled out” weed.

>> b.       he hosted the event. The gathering was held at his residence before moving to a park nearby and then back to his residence;

>> c.       the harm was great. Tragically, one of the attendees of the gathering died as a result of consuming the controlled drug.

28     Whilst probation has been assessed to be still viable by the Probation Officer, Prosecution submitted that the Accused’s ability to be reformed is called into question as he had committed another offence of consumption barely after 6 months from the first offence and even after being charged for very serious offences. This was despite seemingly positive factors highlighted in the probation report such as parents having undertaken closer monitoring over him and the Accused voluntarily seeking treatment and ceasing contact with drug taking peers.

#### Mitigation

29     The Defence relied heavily on the case of _A Karthik v Public Prosecutor_ 5 SLR 1289 that rehabilitation should be at the forefront as a sentencing consideration for young offenders.

30     The Defence, relying on _Karthik_, further submitted that the Probation Officer is in the best position to assess the rehabilitative potential of the Accused and the Court should be slow to depart from the Probation Officer’s recommendation. The Defence Counsel highlighted several strong protective factors in support of the recommendation for probation:

> i.     the Accused’s father has taken 12 months’ leave of absence to ensure that reoffending does not recur;

> ii.     post-probation report, the Accused had been going for treatment to address any issues;

> iii.     the Accused had been engaged in pro-social conduct – the Accused had been engaged as a football coach and had been regularly coaching 3 times a week; and

> iv.     the Accused is in the midst of pursuing his polytechnic diploma. This was cited as an important factor in the case of _Praveen Krishnan v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1300</span> (“_Praveen_”). The alternative of RT, Defence submitted would be destructive and counterproductive to his rehabilitative process.

#### Principle of Sentencing

31     It is well established that rehabilitation would take centre stage as a sentencing consideration for young offenders below the age of 21, given that their capacity for reform would be greater during the formative years of their lives. It has also been generally accepted that the young would tend to be more impulsive and did not know better.

32     The Courts have applied a 2-step inquiry in the sentencing of young offenders:

> i.     the first stage is to identify and prioritize the primary sentencing considerations appropriate to the youth in question having regard to all the circumstances including those of the offence; and

> ii     the second stage is to select the appropriate sentence that would best meet those sentencing considerations and the priority that is placed on the relevant ones

(see _Public Prosecutor v Mohammad Al-Ansari in Basri_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 449</span> at \[77-78\] and _Public Prosecutor v Koh Wen Jie Boaz_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 1 SLR 334</span> at \[28\]).

33     Applying these principles to the present case, based on the offences committed _per se_ I found that the rehabilitation is still a relevant consideration. This is consistent with the fact that probation has been granted even in cases of trafficking in the past which offence carries a more severe punishment. Both prosecution and defence have implicitly taken the position that the offences committed were not so serious to rule out rehabilitation as the primary sentencing principle in their submissions. I also noted that the Accused has had a clean record until the present offences. In the Probation Report, there were several protective factors highlighted that showed positive prospects of successful rehabilitation such as strong familial support and the Accused’s engagement in studies and football coaching.

34     The only issue is which is the most appropriate rehabilitative regime to adopt under the 2nd stage of the inquiry.

35     I found that, at this second stage of the inquiry, a more deterrent element needed to be reflected in the sentence.

36     Firstly, whilst rehabilitation is not ruled out, the fact is that the Accused had committed a very serious offence in arranging for drugs to be consumed by five persons including himself. He initiated the gathering and even provided the controlled drugs for consumption. He even incentivised one of the co-accused to commit an act of trafficking by giving him a small discount for the cost of his drugs to collect the controlled drugs and bring them back for the gathering. The final aggravating factor for this offence is that there was a tragic fatality and the loss of a young life resulting directly from the act of the Accused in arranging for this drug consumption gathering.

37     I would agree with prosecution, that if the Accused had been sentencd as an adult, in the light of the numerous aggravating features, the starting point would have been easily 5 years’ imprisonment.

38     Therefore, clearly the principle of general deterrence would have to be given more precedence in the sentencing of the Accused. Accordingly, the appropriate sentence should be one with a strong dose of deterrence, thus militating towards a sentence of RT.

39     In my view, whilst the Accused did show some capacity for rehabilitation, this factor alone pale considerably when compared to the factors advocating for a more deterrent effect and structured environment afforded by RT.

40     First and foremost, any remorse or horror felt by the Accused as a result of the death of his friend had little lasting effect on the Accused. Instead of completely turning away from controlled drugs and any negative peers, the Accused continued to associate with such peers leading to him committing another offence of consumption barely six months after the tragic incident.

41     In _Praveen_, the offender had pleaded guilty to one charge of consumption of a specified drug and one charge of possession of a controlled drug for the purpose of trafficking. The offender was similarly still studying in polytechnic, had been attending counselling sessions and had volunteered to teach guitar to younger children. On appeal to the High Court, he was granted probation. It was noted by the High Court that the offender had not reoffended since his arrest and ceased all drug-related activities.

42     In my view, the very significant difference between the present case and _Praveen_ is that the Accused had reoffended despite his expressions of remorse. He had admitted to the Probation Officer in the Probation Report at page 5 that after his initial arrest, he had thought that he would be able to resist further temptation. Hence, he did not think much about continuing association with peers who also consumed drugs. Thus when a friend offered him the drug, he was unable to resist the temptation and consumed the drug. This inability to steer clear from negative influence resulted in him re-offending.

43     It is also noteworthy that by this time in March 2019 he would have already been on psychotherapy at Winslow Clinic for about 4 months[^1]. Furthermore, by this time, he had already been charged in court for the first set of offences and would have realised the gravity of the situation. The Accused blatantly threw caution to the wind and recklessly re-offended showing total disregard for the law.

44     The strong familial support whilst present proved ineffective to prevent the reoffending of the Accused. The parents, after the Accused’s arrest, would have stepped up their involvement in the Accused’s life given that they had told the Probation Officer that they were shocked and disappointed by the arrest of the Accused over his drug offences[^2]. Unfortunately, this greater concern of and engagement by the parents were not sufficient to prevent a relapse.

45     Specific deterrence comes very much to the fore in the circumstances of this case. The Accused needs to learn that there is a consequence to his cavalier attitude and failure to take drug offences seriously.

#### Conclusion

46     I am of the view that the more serious the offences are, the greater the onus on a young offender to show strong rehabilitative potential before probation should be granted. He needs to show more than just expression of remorse over the severity of the offences he has committed. He needs to back up such expression of remorse with a change of behaviour and action.

47     The Court has to take into account not just the potential for reform but the overall circumstances of the case, in particular, the culpability of the offender as well as the harm caused by the offender. Here, I found that there is a great need for the application of both general and specific deterrence within the overall umbrella of rehabilitation. Accordingly, RT would be more appropriate as it would serve both the rehabilitative needs as well as the need for deterrence in this case.

48     The Accused had nonetheless shown potential for reform as can been seen in the recommendation for probation in the Probation Report as well as the recommendation in the RT report for the Accused to undergo level 1 intensity of rehabilitation which can be delivered over a 6-month period as opposed to level 2 intensity which would require a minimum of 12 months’ detention. I had thus sentenced the Accused to RT with the shorter period of detention of 6 months pursuant to section 305(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code.
