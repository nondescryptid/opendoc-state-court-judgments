22 July 2019

### District Judge Luke Tan:

## (1)   Introduction

1       In the early morning of 28 January 2017, two riots took place within an hour of each other. Both riots occurred around the vicinity of Orchard Towers, and some members of the first group of rioters, were also involved in the second riot.

2       The accused, Nithiyanathan S/O Veerappan, a 32-year-old male Singaporean was, involved only in the second riot, during which his six-man group inflicted violence against four victims, all foreigners, causing two of them to suffer serious injuries.

3       For his role, the accused was charged with committing an offence of rioting under section 147 Chapter 224. His charge reads:

> “You…. are charged that you on 28 January 2017, at or about 5.49am, outside Orchard Towers located at 400 Orchard Road, Singapore, together with Mohammad Hasri Bin Abdul Hamed, Muhammad Qasim Bin Abdul Raub, Abdul Kahtar Mohideen s/o M A Abdul Barie, Suresh s/o Dashinamoorthy and Muhammad Aidil Bin Sumadi, were members of an unlawful assembly whose common object was to cause hurt to Asiri Yahya Mohamed Y, Barayan Abdulrahman Majed O, Almalki Bader Saud G and Alshehri Khaled Ali M, and in the prosecution of the common object of such assembly, one or more of you had used violence, _to wit_, by punching and kicking two or more of them, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 147 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).”

4       The accused’s case was originally fixed for trial. Subsequently, after setting out the parties’ respective positions, the matter was fixed for a Newton Hearing to resolve issues relevant to sentencing. However, prior to the Newton Hearing itself, the accused’s counsel wrote to the court to indicate that his client would be taking a certain course of action.

5       On 24 June 2019, the accused pleaded guilty to his rioting charge and also admitted to the contents of the statement of facts (SOF) without qualification. The SOF also made reference to CCTV footages that were taken of the incident.

6       Both the Prosecution and the Defence then made extensive submissions on sentence, during which CCTV footages, that showed different aspects and angles taken of the second riot, were shown in court. The Prosecution relied on CCTV footages from two cameras, while the Defence made reference to one of these same two sets of footages, as well as footage from another camera.

7       The Prosecution, represented by DPPs Kelly Ho and Li Yihong sought a sentence of at least 36 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane for the accused. The accused’s counsel, Mr Lau Wen Jin (“Mr Lau”), submitted for a sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment with no caning. Having considered the matters put before me by the parties, as well as the cases tendered, the relevant sentencing principles and factors, and the fact that the accused had been in remand for about 74 days before he was placed on bail, I sentenced the accused to 27 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. The sentencing took place on 25 June 2019. At his request, I deferred the commencement of his sentence until 24 July 2019.

8       On 8 July 2019, the accused filed an appeal against sentence. He is currently on bail pending the hearing of the appeal. I now set out my reasons for the sentence imposed.

## (2)   The Statement of Facts (SOF)

9       The accused admitted to the contents of the SOF without qualification. The SOF is reproduced below, which some parts highlighted in bold and underlined for emphasis.

On 28 January 2017, at around 5.51am, A1 Asiri called ‘999’ stating: “He came to hit me again [left line].” Later at 5.52am, an unknown male caller also called ‘999’ stating: “Case of Stabbing. Got many blood.” The incident location given was Orchard Towers, Blk 400 Orchard Road, Singapore.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><em>Facts pertaining to the charges</em></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">7. Investigations revealed that around midnight on 28 January 2017, the victims visited a few clubs in Orchard Towers. At around the same time, the Accused Persons were working at their respective clubs in Orchard Towers. Whilst on duty, Hasri, Qasim and Kahtar met up with their friends, Nur Zahree Bin Zainudin and Rishi Mohan, for some drinks. They then consumed alcohol at some of the clubs in Orchard Towers.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">8. At around 5am, as the clubs were closing, the victims were walking out of Club Downunder on level 3 of Orchard Towers. Hasri, Qasim, and Kahtar were standing outside the club near the escalators leading down to level 2, escorting customers out of the club. Zahree and Rishi were leaving for home and were walking towards the escalators. Al Asiri made some comments about having to leave the club. Hasri, Qasim, Kahtar, Zahree and Rishi then assaulted A1 Asiri outside Club Cabin, near the escalator on level 3. A1 Asiri managed to escape from the group and ran down the escalator.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">9. Sometime later that morning at around 5.44am, Hasri, Qasim, and Kahtar met up with Suresh, Aidil and <b>Nithiyanathan</b> outside Club Cabin. They went down the lift to the first floor together.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">10. At around 5.49am, the Accused Persons made their way to the entrance of Orchard Towers together, and walked in the direction of the victims who were standing outside Orchard Towers. At around the same time, A1 Asiri had called ‘999’ and left the line when the Accused Persons approached him and the other victims. <b><u>The Accused Persons immediately surrounded the victims and started attacking them</u></b><u>.</u> Qasim, Aidil, Kahtar and Suresh surrounded A2 Barayan and started punching him. In the scuffle, Aidil slashed A2 Barayan on his face with a penknife, which he had earlier kept in his back pocket. Suresh then grabbed A2 Barayan in a chokehold and brought him to the ground.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">11. <b><u>At around the same time, Hasri, Aidil and Nithiyanathan pushed, punched and kicked A1 Asiri, A3 Almalki and A4 Alsheri</u></b>.

A3 Almalki and A4 Alsheri managed to escape and ran across the street. <b><u>Nithiyanathan then kicked A1 Asiri one more time as he lay on the ground, while Aidil bent over A1 Asiri and slashed him about three times on his face with the penknife</u></b>.

The Accused Persons subsequently fled the scene.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">12. A1 Asiri was subsequently conveyed <em>via</em> ambulance to Singapore General Hospital (“SGH”), whilst A2 Barayan was sent to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (“TTSH”).</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">13. <b><u>The assaults were captured on multiple Closed-Circuit Televisions and Police Cameras [CD-ROMs containing video footages - ANNEX A].</u></b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><em>Injuries suffered by victims</em></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">14.

10     A few important matters can immediately be distilled from the SOF:

> (1)     On the date of the offence, the accused and his five co-accused persons were all working for clubs in Orchard Towers, employed as DJs, bouncers, security personnel, floor supervisors or managers (see \[2\] of the SOF).

> (2)     There was an initial riot (“first riot”) at around 5 am when five persons, including some of the co-accused persons assaulted one of the victims, A1 Asiri, who managed to run off and escape. The accused was not involved in the first riot (see \[8\] of the SOF).

> (3)     Subsequently at around 5.44 am, three of the original assailants Hasri, Qasim, and Kahtar met up with other co-accused persons, Suresh, Aidil as well as the accused outside Club Cabin. They went down the lift to the first floor together (see \[9\] of the SOF).

> (4)     At around 5.49 am, the accused and his co-accused persons approached the four victims, and surrounded and attacked them. Three of the co-accused persons including Qasim surrounded one victim, A2 Barayan, and started punching him before the co-accused, Aidil, slashed A2 Barayan on his face with a penknife, while Suresh grabbed A2 Barayan in a chokehold and brought him to the ground (see \[10\] of the SOF).

> (5)     At around the same time, Hasri, Aidil and the accused pushed, punched and kicked the other three victims, two of whom (A3 Almalki and A4 Alsheri) managed to escape. The accused “then kicked A1 Asiri one more time as he lay on the ground, while Aidil bent over A1 Asiri and slashed him about three times on his face with the penknife.” (see \[11\] of the SOF).

> (6)     There were eye witnesses to the incident, and were also multiple Closed-Circuit Televisions and Police Cameras (with the footages contained in CD-ROMS) that captured the assaults. Both the eye witnesses and the CCTV footages were specifically referred to in the SOF (see \[5\] and \[13\] of the SOF).

> (7)     One victim, A1 Asiri, suffered numerous injuries as detailed in the SOF. This has led to him receiving extensive medical treatment in the hospital where he had to be warded for 90 days. Thereafter, A1 Asiri was granted medical leave for 107 days. Amongst other things, A1 Asiri was diagnosed with having severe Broca’s aphasia characterized by moderate receptive language impairment and severe expressive language impairment. He also has severe writing skills impairment with mild reading impairment, and had suffered seizures. The total medical expenses for A1 Asiri amounts to at least S$157,332.75. In addition, he has been recommended to continue speech and language therapy when he returns to Saudi Arabia (see \[14\] – \[20\] of the SOF).

> (8)     Another victim, A2 Barayan, also suffered serious injuries, including a right lateral wall and orbital floor fracture, and left orbital roof fracture, and had to undergo an operation on 8 February 2017. He was also given a total of 33 days of hospitalisation leave. At present, the total medical expenses for A2 Barayan amounts to at least S$9,091.23 (see \[21\] – \[25\] of the SOF).

## (3)   Prescribed Punishment and Antecedents Record

11     An offender who is convicted on a charge of rioting under section 147 of the Penal Code “shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years and shall also be liable to caning.”

12     It is pertinent to note that the maximum imprisonment term of 7 years applies for offences committed on or after 1 February 2008. Prior to that date, the maximum prescribed punishment for a rioting charge was only 5 years’ imprisonment. This is relevant when considering sentences imposed in precedent cases where the offences occurred before 1 February 2008. This issue will be discussed further at a later part of this judgement.

13     The accused only has antecedents related to road traffic offences.

## (4)   Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

14     The Prosecution tendered a written submission and also responded to some of the matters put up by the Defence in its submission. In essence, the Prosecution argued that the sentence imposed should be at least 36 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane due to the following factors:

> (1)     Seriousness of the injuries caused: DPP Kelly Ho argued that the serious injuries suffered by the victims warrants harsh punishment being imposed.

>> (i)       She highlighted that A1 Asiri’s head injury had caused him to lose his ability to speak, and that he has difficulty identifying letters and numbers. Further, he has been greatly hampered in continuing his studies given that he has had to re-learn how to produce vowels and basic sounds. Even after two years, his condition has not significantly improved; he is still having to rely on gestures and pictures to communicate, his writing skills have been severely impaired, and he suffers from difficulty in controlling seizures.

>> (ii)       Whilst it was the co-accused, Aidil, who had inflicted the stab wounds, this does not absolve the accused. This is because an offender who is charged for rioting is not being sentenced for his individual acts considered in isolation, but for his participation in the collective offence of rioting (citing _Phua Song Hua v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGHC 33</span> at \[39\]). Thus, the accused must bear the full consequences of his choice to participate in the group violence, and for the fact that a member of his group was armed with a penknife, as well as for the extensive injuries sustained by the victims.

> (2)     Disruption to public order: The present offence took place early on Saturday morning in Orchard Road, and at Orchard Towers which is a popular drinking spot for locals and foreigners alike. The CCTV footage also clearly captured the large crowd milling outside Orchard Towers, as it was around closing time for most of the pubs in Orchard Towers at that time. Thus, she argued that due to the high human traffic, the potential for group violence to descend into greater chaos and in creating alarm to innocent bystanders is greater.

> (3)     Participation in the violence: The accused was an active participant in the violence against the victims. He had also joined in to kick one of the victims (i.e. A1 Asiri) multiple times, even when the latter had fallen to the ground and was defenceless.

> (4)     Group attack: With reference to the Defence’s focus on the acts of the accused alone, the Prosecution reiterated that we should not just consider the physical act of the accused himself, as this is not a charge against him of voluntarily causing hurt. Instead, the accused was part of a group attack. As his co-accused Aidil, who carried out the slashing, was also part of the group, the accused can and should also be held liable for the actions of the group. Further, it is impossible to pin-point the actions of each individual member of the group, and we should consider the acts and violence perpetuated by the group in totality. Moreover, the accused was not a passive onlooker, and his acts cannot be said to be minimal.

> (5)     Plea of guilt: Little weight should be given to the accused’s plea of guilt. Unlike his co-accused, Qasim, who had pleaded guilty before the trial dates were given, the accused only decided to plead guilty on Day 4 of the trial. Also, the accused’s actions had been captured on video footage, and thus there was already strong evidence against him.

15     The Prosecution also tendered a table of sentencing precedents. Of the cases in the table, DPP Ho urged me to consider, in particular, the sentences imposed in the following two cases:

> (1)      _Mohamad Iskandar Mariano bin Roslan v PP_ **(**MA 221/2003): For this case, the young offender, who was only 19 years old and who had not caused serious injury to the victim (pain in his left knee), was sentenced to 3 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane for a rioting offence. This was because the district judge saw the need to impose a deterrent sentence due to the offender’s previous rioting conviction.

> (2)      _PP v Mohd Jeffri bin Ithnin_ (MA 349/2000). Here, the offender was sentenced to 3 years’ imprisonment and 9 strokes of the cane, even though the injuries that were caused were minor (bruises). However, there was a large number of people (more than twenty persons) involved in the riot, and they greatly outnumbered the two victims.

16     The Prosecution argued that in the present case, there were a total of six persons, namely the accused and his five co-accused persons, who had likewise punched and kicked the two victims. The seriousness of the injuries sustained by the victims, and the aggravating circumstances of the case, justified imposing a similarly deterrent sentence.

17     Further, as regards the High Court case of _Phua Song Hua_ that the Defence (and the Prosecution) had cited in its submissions, the DPP pointed out that the High Court there did not actually set out any benchmark sentence. Instead, the High Court had made the observation that the sentencing range for an offence under section 147 is 18 months to 36 months’ imprisonment, and caning of between 3 to 12 strokes. Nevertheless, the sentences imposed in _Mohd Jeffri bin Ithnin_ (36 months’ imprisonment and 9 strokes of the cane) and in _Mohamad Iskandar Mariano bin Roslan v PP_ (3 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane) were within the sentencing range identified in _Phua Song Hua._

18     The Prosecution reiterated that the co-accused, Qasim, who had pleaded guilty way before the accused, was sentenced to 33 month’s imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane for a charge that is equivalent to that of the accused. Thus, even if there should be a difference in their sentences, the length of the sentences imposed for each of them should not be very far apart. In this regard, Qasim had also not used a knife during the riot. The Prosecution further stated that in cases of group assault, there cannot be a significant significance in the sentence of the co-offenders, especially so in light of the operation of the parity principle (citing _Lim Bee Ngan Karen v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 183</span>).

## (5)   Defence’s submissions on sentence

19     The Defence Counsel tendered a written submission on sentence, a written reply to Prosecution’s submissions on sentence, and also made oral submissions.

20     The essential features of the Defence’s submissions are set out below:

> (1)     Counsel argued that the following features that may be aggravating for such offences, were all not present in this case:

>> (i)       A vulnerable victim;

>> (ii)       Any common object to cause serious injury;

>> (iii)       Premeditation;

>> (iv)       The offence being secret society-related or racially motivated; and

>> (v)       Any abuse of position on the part of the accused.

> (2)     The accused was not implicated in the first riot. As for the second riot, he was not involved for a large part of it. He only joined in the fight towards the end, after initially smoking, stepping back and observing it. Thus, there was no premeditation on the accused’s part, and he joined in the fight spontaneously.

> (3)     The accused’s role could be clearly delineated, and it was shown in the CCTV footage that he only inflicted a very low level of violence in that he only used force (a single kick and a push) on a single victim Al Asiri. In this regard in deciding on sentence, the court can take into account the actual conduct of an offender in the riot (citing _Lim Thiam Hor v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 1 SLR(R) 758</span>, which was applied in _Phua Song Hua_ at \[39\] and \[40\], _Public Prosecutor v Mukhantan s/o Perumal_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGDC 94</span> at \[33\], and _Public Prosecutor v Leong Soon Kheong_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 4 SLR(R) 63</span>).

> (4)     Counsel also argued that the accused had only admitted to the facts set out in the SOF, and that in its submissions on sentence, the Prosecution should not make reference to the contents of the CCTV, which were not part of the SOF that the accused had agreed to or which contained matters that were not proven (citing _K Saravanan Kuppusamy v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 88</span> and _Public Prosecutor v Development 26 Pte Ltd_ \[2015\] 1 SLR 30).

> (5)     Specifically, as regards the Prosecution’s allegation that the accused had kicked A1 Asiri three times, counsel disputed this arguing that not all the kicks may have landed on the target. Counsel submitted that the first time that the accused allegedly kicked at A1 Asiri, the kick could have missed or the footage could merely have showed him jumping. For the second time that the accused allegedly kicked at A1 Asiri, the CCTV footage showed that someone else had pushed A1 Asiri, and this was what had actually caused him to fall down. The accused’s kick had missed hitting A1 Asiri on this occasion. Only the accused’s third kick had landed on A1 Asiri when he was on the ground. At most this would have caused him to have suffered a bruise.

> (6)     Moreover, the accused did not use any weapon, and he was not aware that others were armed. He was also less culpable than the co-accused persons, and his sentence must be proportionate to the harm or injury that he had caused. In this regard, while he had used force against A1 Asiri, and while Al Asiri had suffered serious injuries, those injuries were attributable to the co-accused Aidil (who had slashed Al Asiri three times on his face with a penknife), and were not attributable to the accused. As for the other three victims named in the charge, A2 Barayan, A3 Almalki, and A4 Alsheri, the accused did not actually use force against them.

> (7)     At the onset, the accused had admitted to kicking A1 Asiri in his statement dated 4 February 2017. However, he did not plead guilty earlier as his position has always been that the more appropriate and fairer charge against him was that of voluntary causing hurt. He should also receive a sentencing discount for pleading guilty instead of claiming trial, as this has avoided wastage of resources. Further, he was sorry for pushing and kicking A1 Asiri and his plea of guilt is indicative of his genuine remorse. In addition, he had cooperated with the investigating authorities and surrendered during the early stages of the investigation.

> (8)     The accused does not have any criminal antecedents except for some traffic/parking offences. He supports his widow mother who is elderly and who has a heart condition (she went for a bypass surgery). His mother also lives with him in a rental flat. There would be financial strain on the family if the accused should be put in prison for a long time.

21     Counsel sought to distinguish the sentence of 33 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane that was imposed on the co-accused Qasim who had pleaded guilty earlier. He argued that Qasim’s case was entirely different from that of the accused, and that the consideration of parity was not applicable for the following reasons:

> (1)     Qasim was a senior member of a secret society and sentences involving secret society members are enhanced.

> (2)     Qasim was also involved in both the first and second riots. For the second riot, there was premeditation on Qasim’s part, while the accused only joined the riot at the end.

> (3)     Further, Qasim faced other charges. He was sentenced for three separate rioting offences and one offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt. This showed a certain pattern of conduct on the part of Qasim, and this factor must have weighed heavily on the mind of the sentencing judge. Qasim also had four charges which were taken into consideration for sentencing (TIC charges). The TIC charges would have had an effect on enhancing the sentence in Qasim’s case. They also showed premeditation on Qasim’s part.

> (4)     There was also an abuse of positon in Qasim’s case as he was working as a bouncer on the date of the offence. In contrast, this factor does not apply to the accused who was a DJ at that time.

22     The accused also addressed the court and informed the court that he was remorseful when he saw blood on the victim and that he was badly injured. The accused said that he would apologise to the victims. In addition, the accused said that his mother has had a bypass, and that he wants to finish his imprisonment sentence and to be around to see her.

23     As for the precise sentence to impose on the accused in the present case:

> (1)     Counsel argued that there is a “well-established and well-applied sentencing benchmark” of 18 to 24 months’ imprisonment (citing the Practitioners’ Library Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts 3rd Ed (2013) at p 377) which arose from the decision in _Phua Song Hua._

> (2)     Counsel also cited the cases referred to in _Public Prosecutor v Nirmal Singh_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 293</span> at \[12\], where co-accused persons, who had pleaded guilty to section 147 charges were sentenced to 24 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane for their actions of swinging their belts at other persons.

> (3)     Counsel argued that based on the sentencing factors and cases that he had highlighted, the appropriate starting sentence for the present case should be 18 months’ imprisonment. This sentence should then be further reduced by 3 months on account of the accused having been in remand for (what counsel said was) “slightly more than 12 weeks” (citing _Vasentha d/o Joseph v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 122</span> (“_Vasentha_”) at \[86\]).

> (4)     Finally, counsel argued that no caning should be imposed as the accused has a clean record and had pleaded guilty.

## (6)   The Court’s decision

### (a)   Precedents tendered and the usual sentencing range for rioting offences

24     It was clear that for rioting offences under section 147, stiff sentences have been meted out by the courts. However, what could also be seen from the cases in the Prosecution’s sentencing table that was tendered to the court, was that the sentences imposed by the courts in the different cases have come within a wide range, with imprisonment terms of 10 months, 12 months, 15 months, 18 months, 20 months, 24 months, and 36 months being imposed in different cases. Further, caning of between 3 to 9 strokes has been imposed on some offenders, while in some other cases, no caning has been imposed. These figures suggest that the sentences imposed in those cases have been very fact specific, likely depending on particularly circumstances of the offence, and/or the unique facts of the different offenders.

25     However, as many of the cases in referred to by the Prosecution in their sentencing table were unreported decisions, it was difficult to ascertain the basis by which the sentences were reached in those cases. In this regard, I note the caution expressed by Chan Sek Keong CJ (as he then was) in _Luong Thi Trang Hoang Kathleen v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 1 SLR 707</span> against relying on unreported decisions as “(c)omparisons based on unreported decisions are difficult and are _likely to be misleading_ because a proper appraisal of the particular facts and circumstances are simply lacking” … (at \[21\]).

26     Thus, it was to the reported cases, and the guidance provided by the courts in those cases, that I largely looked at in determining the appropriate sentence to impose in the present case. To this end, I first considered the decision of the High Court in _Phua Song Hua_, which was a case that both the Prosecution and the Defence had referred me to.

27     In _Phua Song Hua_, Yong Pung How CJ (as he then was) had to decide on an appeal against conviction and sentence filed by an offender who had been convicted of two separate charges of rioting under section 147 of the Penal Code. While I agree with the Prosecution that his Honour there did not actually set out a benchmark for rioting offences under section 147, Yong CJ nonetheless noted, without disapproval, at \[42\] that:

> “The courts have consistently imposed 18 to 36 months’ imprisonment, as well as caning ranging from three to 12 strokes: _Chua Hwee Kiat Louis v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] SGDC 220</span>, _Yim Kar Mun Stanley v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] SGDC 1</span>, _Osman bin Ramli v PP_ (\[35\] supra), _Rajasekaran s/o Armuthelingam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] SGHC 275</span> and _Tan Li Hui v PP_ \[1999\] SGDC.”

28     It should, however, be noted that the sentencing range for rioting offences that Yong CJ referred to in _Phua Song Hua_, pertained to cases decided prior to 1 February 2008. In _Phua Song Hua_ itself, when deciding the sentence of the offender for his rioting charges, Yong CJ explicitly recognised that the maximum prescribed imprisonment for a section 147 offence was 5 years’ imprisonment (see \[39\] of _Phua Song Hua_).

29     Since the maximum prescribed imprisonment term for section 147 offences has since been increased from 5 years to 7 years, in the case of offences committed on or after 1 February 2008, it could be argued that such an increase in the maximum prescribed sentence reflects the legislature’s desire for stiffer imprisonment sentences to be meted out for those who commit such offences.

30     In this regard, the Court of Appeal in _Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 653</span> (“_Angliss”_) had made it clear at \[84\] that “…sentencing judges must take note of the maximum penalty and then apply their minds to determine precisely where the offender’s conduct falls within the spectrum of punishment devised by Parliament.” Thus, it may well be that the “sentencing band” of 18 months to 36 months’ imprisonment – recognised and implicitly endorsed in _Phua Song Hua -_ should now be raised to reflect the harsher attitude that the courts may now be expected to take towards perpetrators of such offences.

31     Accordingly, in determining the sentence of the accused in the present case, I had to carefully consider “…precisely where \[his\] conduct falls within the spectrum of punishment” of up to 7 years of imprisonment, rather than the maximum range of up to 5 years’ imprisonment which applied in _Phua Song Hua._

### (b)   Group offence, violence inflicted and serious injuries caused

32     In _Phua Song Hua_, Yong CJ also set out the following useful guidance for courts dealing with section 147 offences:

> (1)    “The gravamen of the offence of rioting is the pursuit of the common unlawful purpose through weight of numbers. **The individual is thus not being sentenced for his individual acts considered in isolation, but for his participation in the collective offence of rioting**” \[39\]

> (2)    “The principle does not imply that the role of the accused, relative to the other offenders, can never be taken into account” \[40\].

\[emphasis added\]

33     The importance of considering the effect of the group, rather than just focussing on the effort of just the individual rioter, was also recognised in the recent case of _Public Prosecutor v Nirmal Singh_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 293</span>, a case that was referred to in the Defence’s written submissions. At \[27\] of the judgement, the court stated that:

> “….in such cases of mob violence, rather than just look at the act of any one individual of the group, one should consider the collective effect and violence of the group as a whole. If nothing else, each member of the group could, through his own participation and involvement, have emboldened and spurred on the rest of the group, significantly magnifying the damage that could have been caused.”

34     The decision in _Nirmal Singh_ was subsequently affirmed by the High Court on appeal.

35     Separately, while it was also recognised in _Phua Song Huat_ that the role of the individual offender may still be relevant, it appears that one of the main issues that needs to be considered when looking at this issue is whether the offender himself had actually inflicted any violence against the victim(s).

> (1)     Thus in _Lim Thiam Hor v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 1 SLR(R) 758</span>, another case referred to by the Defence, the offender who did not attack the victim himself was sentenced to 18 months, while his son, who had used violence against the victim, received a sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment and six strokes (see \[40\] of _Phua Song Huat_)

> (2)     Similarly, in _Phua Song Hua_ itself, the offender (Phua) received quite different sentences for his two separate rioting charges:

>> (i)       Where Phua himself had not used any violence in respect of the first rioting charge, Yong CJ accepted that a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment without caning was sufficient. In affirming this sentence, Yong CJ also took into account Phua’s young age (see \[40\] of _Phua Song Huat_).

>> (ii)       However, in respect of the second rioting charge, where Phua had used violence by punching one of the two victims on the side of the head while the latter was on the ground, his sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment and caning of three strokes was affirmed. This sentence was imposed despite the fact of Phua’s young age, and despite the fact that the injuries suffered by the two victims were relatively minor in the form of bruises on their heads and arms (see \[41\] of _Phua Song Huat_).

36     In the present case, I note that serious injuries had been caused by the group as a whole, and that the accused himself had actively and deliberately participated in the riot, and had inflicted violence in the course of it.

> (1)     First, it was not disputed that very serious injuries were caused to the victims, in particular to A1 Asiri and also to A2 Barayan. These injuries were extensive, and caused not only immediate pain and suffering, but also resulted in long periods of hospitalisation (90 days in the case of A1 Asiri), followed by extensive periods of hospitalisation leave having to be given (107 days in the case of A1 Asiri and 33 days in the case of A2 Barayan)). Huge medical bills had been incurred, especially in the case of A1 Asiri (at least S$157,332.75), and his grave and debilitating injuries have severely impacted his well-being, and seriously hampered his ability to live a normal and productive life. This is especially unfortunate as both of these victims are young men, in the prime of their lives, since A1 Asiri is only about 23 years old, while B2 Barayan is only 25 years old. Both were also students at the material time.

> (2)     As the accused was indisputably a member of the six-man group which had the common object of cause hurting to the four victims, the accused cannot now shy away from the consequences of the actions of the group, nor can he disassociate himself from the injuries that had resulted to the victims. In this regard, I agreed that it was not fully possible to pin-point the precise actions of individual members of the rioting group, and that we should consider the acts in totality and the violence perpetuated by the group as a whole. Indeed, I would echo the words of Yong CJ in _Phua Song Hua_ that “(t)he gravamen of the offence of rioting is the pursuit of the common unlawful purpose through weight of numbers. The individual is thus not being sentenced for his individual acts considered in isolation, but for his participation in the collective offence of rioting” (\[39\] of _Phua Song Huat)_.

> (3)     Second, even in the case of the slash injuries inflicted by his co-accused Aidil on A1 Asiri, the accused cannot distance himself from them, especially as it was quite clear that the accused had kicked A1 Asiri around the same time that his co-accused, Aidil, was inflicting the slash injuries on the same victim. Both Aidil and the accused had also attacked A1 Asiri while the latter was already on the ground after having been felled by the actions of the group of rioters (see \[11\] of the SOF, as well as the CCTV footages that were shown in court and referred to at \[13\] of the SOF that the accused had admitted to). Thus, like Aidil, the accused had attacked A1 Asiri when the latter was essentially helpless and in an exposed position. In the circumstances, what the accused did, by ganging up with Aidil at that time to attack a vulnerable and defenceless victim, can only be described as vicious and savage.

> (4)     In short, the accused was liable as a member of the rioting group for the violence inflicted by that same group on its victims. Further, not only was the accused a member of the mob that had attacked the victims, he was an active participant who had clearly and cruelly inflicted violence himself. He had also done so in a reprehensible and deplorable manner. Under such circumstances, the sentence that has to be imposed on him must be sufficiently stiff not only to reflect that his charge is essentially one of mob violence against the victims, but also to recognise that the accused himself had used violence, as well as to take into account the devastating harm that has been caused.

### (c)   Scene of offence, disruption to public disorder and danger to bystanders

37     In _Public Prosecutor v Md Al Amin Faruqe Azam and Sumon Md Halim_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGDC 133</span>, a decision of a District Court which was affirmed on appeal, the court had looked at sentencing considerations set out in the “Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts” 3rd Ed (2013) at p 376-378 for section 147 offences. Amongst other things, the authors had commented that: “For adult offenders, a sentence of imprisonment is inevitable. The length of the imprisonment term would depend on the size of the group or the scale of the riot, the duration of the attack, the level of violence, the extent of injuries or the present or potential danger of injury inherent, the use of weapons, the degree of deliberation in committing the offence and **the nature of the premises/scene of the offence**.” (emphasis added)

38     In the present case, the offence had taken place in the early morning in a public area, just outside Orchard Towers which was in a tourist distinct. As could be seen from the footages, there were numerous onlookers (numbering at least in the tens) in the vicinity at the time the riot occurred. In this regard, I accepted the Prosecution’s argument that in the circumstances, the riot could have caused grave pubic alarm, and that potential chaos could have resulted. Further, there was real danger posed to innocent bystanders, both from violence that may be accidentally inflicted on those who could have been caught in the melee (see \[28\] of _Nirmal Singh_), as well as to unfortunate third parties who may get hurt trying to escape from the violence taking place around them.

39     Clearly, such circumstances also call for a deterrent sentence to be imposed.

### (d)   Parity in Sentencing

40     The Prosecution also argued that the principle of parity in sentencing should also apply in the present case, such that the sentence that I impose on the accused should take into account the sentence of 33 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane that had been imposed on his co-accused, Qasim, for the equivalent charge. In fact, the Prosecution argued that the accused’s sentence should be higher than that of Qasim since:

> (1)     Qasim had pleaded guilty much earlier, while the accused had only pleaded guilty on the 4th day of trial; and

> (2)     As Qasim had pleaded guilty to a total of 4 charges: 3 separate rioting offences as well as a charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, the sentences he had received for each charge (including the charge equivalent to that faced by the present accused) were likely to have been moderated downwards to take into account the totality principle. In other words, Qasim would have received a higher sentence for his involvement in the same riot as the current accused, had there not been other offences that he was also sentenced to at the same sitting. As such, the Prosecution appeared essentially to be saying that I should have regard to the notionally higher sentence that Qasim would have received, had he been sentenced to only the equivalent rioting charge as that faced by the accused, and that it was this notionally higher sentence for Qasim that I should consider when deciding the sentence to impose on the accused.

41     As regards the principle of parity, Yong Pung How CJ (as he then was) in _PP v Ramlee_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 95</span> (“_Ramlee_”) had stated at \[7\] of the case that:

> “Where two or more offenders are to be sentenced for participation in the same offence, the sentences passed on them should be the same, unless there is a relevant difference in their responsibility for the offence or their personal circumstances …”

42     In _Lim Bee Ngan Karen v Public Prosecutor_, a case cited by the Prosecution, Chao Hick Tin JA (as he then was) had explained at \[53\] that “\[t\]he objective of the parity principle is to **ensure that there is a high level of consistency in sentencing**”.

\[emphasis mine\]

43     Finally, in the recent case of _Chong Han Rui v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 25</span>, Sundaresh Menon CJ elaborated on the parity principle in the following terms:

> “47.  The crucial consideration in considering the application of the parity principle is not whether the accused feels aggrieved that a co-accused person has been treated more leniently, but whether the public, with knowledge of the various sentences, would perceive that the appellant had suffered injustice (Kow Keng Siong, Sentencing Principles in Singapore (Academy Publishing, 2009) (“Sentencing Principles in Singapore”), citing R v Lowe, The Times (14 November 1989) at para 13.019). **In my judgment, it is useful to understand that the parity principle ultimately rests on the need to preserve and protect public confidence in the administration of justice**. Public confidence in this context demands that sentencing is carried out with due regard to the element of basic fairness. **Where this is not the case, and where co-offenders in a common criminal enterprise are sentenced in an unduly disparate manner, the sentences would then seem to be arbitrarily imposed and this raises fundamental rule of law concerns….”**

\[emphasis mine\]

44     In line with the above authorities, I agreed that the principle of parity is clearly an important and relevant consideration in the present case, especially since both Qasim and the accused faced essentially the same charges, and as both Qasim and the accused had not used any weapon during the riot. That said, there were clearly differences in Qasim’s case from that of the accused which could not be ignored. These differences, highlighted by both the Prosecution and the Defence, meant that their final sentences should not be identical.

> (1)     First, Qasim was involved in not one, but two riots against A1 Asiri, with the first riot taking place a short distance away and a short time before the second riot occurred. Indeed, it appeared that Qasim and his friends had purposely sought our A1 Asiri after the first riot had taken place. In contrast, the accused was not involved in the first riot, and he only joined in the later confrontation after his fellow rioters were fully involved (as shown in the CCTV footage shown by the Defence). Qasim’s involvement in the earlier riot had also resulted in him facing an additional rioting charge that was taken into consideration for sentencing.

> (2)     Second, Qasim, being a bouncer on the date of the offence, had undermined the safety and security of the patrons (i.e. the victims) that he was originally tasked to look after by attacking them. This was unlike the accused, who was engaged as a DJ and who thus did not play the same “protective role”. That said, I was cognisant of the fact that the riot had occurred outside club premises, and also after closing hours.

> (3)     Third, Qasim was a senior member of a secret society, while there was no evidence that the accused played the same role. Of course, it could also be argued that there was no evidence that Qasim’s secret society link, was directly relevant to the riot that had occurred, nor that it had played any part in its consequences.

45     However, a strong mitigating feature that may have featured in Qasim’s sentencing was the fact that he had pleaded guilty much earlier on 17 January 2019, while the accused here pleaded guilty only after trial dates had been fixed (albeit I agreed with the Defence that the trial did not actually commence). Thus, in terms of demonstrating remorse or saving of public resources and court time by his plea of guilt, even as I accepted that some discount should be given to the accused, clearly he should receive less of a sentencing discount than Qasim.

46     Thus, after carefully reviewing all the relevant sentencing considerations, I was of the view that while the accused should receive a custodial sentence that should be less than that imposed on Qasim, his sentence should nevertheless not differ too much from the custodial sentence of 33 months’ imprisonment that Qasim had received. On balance, I was of the view that a sentence of about 30 months’ imprisonment – or about three months less than what Qasim was sentenced to - would have been an appropriate sentence, bearing in mind the circumstances of the case.

### (e)   Period spent in remand and personal circumstances

47     In addition, I note that, unlike Qasim, the accused had been remanded for a considerably long period before he was released on bail. Counsel argued that a period of 12 weeks should be deducted from his “notional” imprisonment sentence, in order to take into account (what counsel initially thought was) a period of more than 12 weeks that the accused had spent in remand.

48     While it was subsequently clarified in court that the accused’s period of remand was actually only 74 days, from the date that he was first charged until the date that he was released on bail, I was of the view that a deduction of 3 months’ imprisonment – to take into account his period of remand as well as his personal and family circumstances cited in mitigation – was not inappropriate. Accordingly, I deducted a term of 3 months from the 30 months’ imprisonment sentence that I would have otherwise imposed, to reach a final custodial sentence of 27 months’ imprisonment.

### (f)   Whether caning should be imposed

49     As for the question of caning, I was of the view that contrary to counsel’s argument, neither a plea of guilt nor the relative young age of an offender is necessarily an impediment to caning being imposed. This is clear even from some of the cases set out in the Prosecution’s table of precedents.

50     In the present case, wanton and serious violence had been inflicted by the rioters, including by the accused himself. A weapon had also been used, albeit by the co-accused who had nonetheless done so in the presence of the accused, and at around the same time and on the same victim that the accused was assaulting. Further, as discussed above, all of these acts of violence were inflicted in full public view, and had posed danger and alarm to members of the public who were present. The acts of violence had also resulted in horrendous consequences as detailed in the SOF.

51     Clearly caning should be imposed on the accused, both in line with the principle of deterrence (see _Chia Kim Heng Frederick v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1992\] 1 SLR(R) 63</span>), and as a manifestation of the retributive principle (see Sentencing Principles in Singapore (Academy Publishing 2009) at page 1087).

52     Thus, consistent with the 6 strokes that was imposed on the co-accused Qasim, and also consistent with _Phua Song Hua_, I ordered that the accused receive 6 strokes of the cane.

## (7)   Summary

53     In summary, I imposed a sentence of 27 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane on the accused. I am of the view that such a sentence is fair and proportionate, and adequately reflects the culpability, harm and the aggravating and mitigating features of the case, including the period of remand that the accused had undergone before he was released on bail.

54     The custodial sentence is also within the 18-36 months’ imprisonment range that the High Court in _Phua Song Hua_ had recognised to have been imposed for non-secret society related offences in earlier cases even though, as noted above at \[29\], the maximum prescribed imprisonment sentence has since been raised from 5 years’ imprisonment (at the time of _Phua Soon Huat)_ to 7 years’ imprisonment in the present day.

55     Finally, the accused’s sentence of 6 strokes is similarly within the range of three to 12 strokes referred to in _Phua Soon Hua._

56     The accused, being dissatisfied, has filed an appeal against the sentence. He is on bail pending the hearing of the appeal.
