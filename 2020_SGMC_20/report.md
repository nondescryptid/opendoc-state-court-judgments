### District Judge Shaiffudin Bin Saruwan:

## INTRODUCTION

The Accused pleaded guilty to one charge of mischief under s 427 of the Penal Code, Cap 224 (“PC”).

2       On 5 Aug 18, the Accused went for drinks with two colleagues at a bar. Thereafter he went to another location and continued drinking. Sometime past midnight, he left for home at Sengkang East Way. When he alighted from the Grab car at the foot of his flat, he saw a police car parked near the rubbish chute of his flat. No one was inside the police car. At the time, the police officers were at 11th floor of the flat responding to a case.

3       The Accused picked up a piece of concrete brick measuring 24 cm by 16 cm from a garden at the foot of the flat. He then took the elevator up. He alighted at an unknown floor, and threw the brick at the police car parked below. He knew that the brick would likely cause damage to the police car. Having done the deed, he went home to his unit on the fifth floor.

4       The brick caused a large dent on the bonnet of the police car. The damage amounted to S$2,782.60. The Accused was arrested at 5.00 am the same day at his home.

5       The Accused had made full restitution for the damage. He is a first offender.

## PROSECUTION’S SUBMISSION ON SENTENCE

6       DPP Michelle Tay sought a sentence of two months’ imprisonment. She pointed out three factors that warranted this. First, the offence was committed on a public institution ie the Singapore Police Force. The police car was integral to the discharge of police functions. It was trite law that deterrence was the primary sentencing consideration in such cases.

7       Secondly, the Accused had employed a highly dangerous means of causing damage to the police car. There was a high level of potential harm to the public that could be caused by the act. It was fortuitous that no one was injured. In such circumstances, the need to protect the public warranted the sentence proposed.

8       Thirdly, the Accused was intoxicated at the material time. Ordinarily, intoxication was treated as an aggravating factor in the commission of an offence. Intoxication could not be used as an excuse for the Accused’s action. He should be held to the full consequences of his criminal behaviour.

9       DPP Tay cited two cases to show that the prosecution’s proposed sentence was consistent with the case precedents. In _PP v Lim Hock Soon_ (DAC 909624/14) (“_Lim Hock Soon_”), the offender was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment for using his fingers to dig at and peel away a portion of the padded flooring of a padded lock-up cell at Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional Headquarters. The damage caused was S$2,480. In the second case, _PP v Goran Jeremic_ (MAC 900013/14)(“_Goran Jeremic_”), the offender, a tourist, was sentenced to three weeks’ imprisonment for ripping the padding from the floor of a padded lock-up cell at Central Police Divisional Headquarters. The damage caused was S$12,153.52.

10     DPP Tay stressed that the prosecution’s proposed sentence had been calibrated after taking into account the fact that the Accused had pleaded guilty and had made full restitution. She concluded by saying that two months’ imprisonment appropriately reflected the harm caused, the Accused’s culpability and gave proper effect to the need for general deterrence against such behaviour.

## ACCUSED’S MITIGATION PLEA

11     Mr Kalidas highlighted the following factors which he said were mitigating -

> (i)     The act was random in nature ie there was no premeditation. There was no evidence that the Accused had specifically targeted the police car.

> (ii)     The incident happened very early in the morning so there was very little likelihood of harm to the public.

> (iii)     Full restitution was made early on.

> (iv)     Full cooperation was rendered to the police.

> (v)     He has pleaded guilty which showed his genuine remorse.

> (vi)     The act was a one-off incident.

> (vii)     He has a clean record, and the testimonials attesting to his good conduct and character showed a high propensity for reform.

12     For the above reasons, Mr Kalidas sought for a high fine of up to the maximum of S$10,000 or in the alternative, for a short detention order (“SDO”) coupled with a community service order (“CSO”).

13     In relation to his submission for a fine, he cited several cases where fines ranging between S$3,000 to S$7,300 have been imposed.

14     In his alternative submission for SDO and CSO, he said that SDO and CSO struck a balance between deterrence and rehabilitation. The SDO would give the Accused a “_short sharp shock_”, and the CSO would require him to “_make amends to the community_” for the offence, citing _Kalaiarasi d/o Marimuthu Innasimuthu v PP_ \[2012\] SLR 74 (at \[35\]) in support. The punitive element of SDO would satisfy the need for deterrence, and CSO would facilitate his rehabilitation. With SDO and CSO, there would be minimal dislodgement from family and employment, and this in turn would facilitate his reintegration into society.

## THE SENTENCE

### What is the appropriate type of sentence?

15     The offence committed was colloquially known as the ‘killer litter’ offence. Prosecution of such cases was usually under s 336(a) PC. In the context of s 336(a) PC, a custodial sentence was the norm because the key sentencing consideration for a ‘killer litter’ offence was deterrence[^1]. The underlying rationale was that as the majority of the population in Singapore live in high-rise flats and/or apartments, acts of throwing items down to the ground must be severely curtailed before the problem become unmanageable. The potential harm that could be caused, in terms of personal injury and/or property damage, was obvious. In my view, this underlying rationale applied with equal force in this case, albeit in the context of a mischief charge under s 427 PC. Therefore, a custodial sentence was warranted in this case. Case precedents showed that deterrent sentences, in the form of imprisonment, have been meted out for offences of mischief where some aspect of public interest was engaged, for example, where the mischief offence was committed in the context of a “road rage”.

16     SDO and CSO, both community-based sentences, were only appropriate in cases where the key sentencing consideration was rehabilitation, or where rehabilitation displaced deterrence as the key sentencing consideration, for example a youthful offender. I did not think that rehabilitation superseded deterrence as the key sentencing consideration in this case; the Accused’s clean record, his good character, and his seeming propensity towards rehabilitation notwithstanding. The public interest considerations set out in \[15\] warranted the imposition of a deterrent sentence.

17     The facts of _PP v Teo Chang Heng_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1163</span> (“_Teo Chang Heng_”) which Mr Kalidas cited to support his submission for SDO and CSO were distinguishable from those of the present case. In _Teo Chang Heng_, the respondent had pleaded guilty to an offence of mischief under s 426 PC for causing damage to a car belonging to his spouse which was driven by the spouse’s boyfriend. The respondent and his spouse were separated at the material time but he was hopeful for a reconciliation. He happened to chance upon the boyfriend driving his spouse’s car. Consumed by anger and frustration, he impulsively followed the boyfriend and used his car to cause damage to his spouse’s car.

18     See Kee Oon J, in affirming the sentence of ten days’ SDO and 120 hours CSO, explicitly stated that the facts were unusual and quite exceptional. He found that the respondent had –

> “…snapped and acted rashly and impulsively, in hot blood and without actual planning or premeditation. … Within a matter of moments, he immediately sought to atone for what he had done – he called the police to surrender himself.”[^2]

See J also found the act of self-reporting the offence to be demonstrably spontaneous, and that it reflected the respondent’s palpable remorse and contrition. This was a strong indication of a potential for rehabilitation.

19     The facts in the present case were not so unusual and exceptional. The Accused’s offence was not something done in ‘hot blood’. The offence was formed in the Accused’s mind when he saw the parked police car. Therefore I disagreed that he had not targeted the police car. I would agree with Mr Kalidas that it was not planned insofar as the crime was formed spontaneously in his head when he saw the police car. But after that, there was some level of deliberation when he went to the garden and picked up the brick to use as a projectile. Unlike the respondent in _Teo Chang Heng_, after the deed was done, the Accused had gone home to sleep. He was only arrested some four hours later.

20     More significantly, in _Teo Chang Heng_, See J did not find any pressing public policy considerations that militated against the imposition of the community-based sentences. In the present case, there were public policy considerations that rendered SDO and CSO inappropriate.

21     Mr Kalidas pointed out the Accused’s demeanour and behaviour after his arrest and during his psychiatric assessment which Mr Kalidas argued pointed to his genuine remorse and contrition. I accepted the point that the Accused had demonstrated his remorse and contrition. However, it did not reach the same level as that in _Teo Chang Heng_. Although I would give it the appropriate weight as a mitigating factor, it did not displace deterrence as the primary sentencing consideration.

22     I also accepted Mr Kalidas’s point that this was a one-off incident and not in keeping with the Accused’s general character. The testimonials tendered on behalf of the Accused supported this conclusion. In other words, the Accused had committed the offence because of his intoxicated state. On the other hand, I agreed with the submissions of DPP Tay at \[8\] above, that intoxication could not be used as an excuse for his conduct. He must bear the consequences of his voluntary excessive consumption of alcohol: see _PP v Stephen Albert_ (MA 9254/2017 & CM 10/2018). However, in this case, I did not treat the intoxication as an aggravating factor, although I was mindful that in _Wong Hoi Len v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 1 SLR(R) 115</span> (“_Wong Hoi Len_”), V K Rajah JA had said that the sentencing judge should ordinarily take into account intoxication as an aggravating factor. _Wong Hoi Len_ had involved the offence of voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 PC. In that context, an assault by a person who was at the time intoxicated would certainly have instilled greater fear, anxiety and trauma on the victim. In this context, intoxication would be an aggravating factor. However, that was not the case here.

23     For the same reasons that led me to the conclusion that SDO and CSO were not appropriate sentences, I was also not persuaded that a fine, even the maximum amount of S$10,000, would constitute sufficient deterrence such that it would adequately address the public interest considerations in this case. The cases cited by Mr Kalidas in support for a fine did not involve the type of public policy considerations that featured in the present case.

### What is the appropriate quantum of imprisonment?

24     I now turn to the two cases under s 427 PC that involved damage to police property cited by DPP Tay. The first was _Lim Hock Soon_ (at \[9\]). The accused person in that case was found by police officers standing naked and incoherent along the common corridor of a flat. When placed in a padded lock-up cell at the Ang Mo Kio Police Division Headquarters, he used his fingers to dig at and peeled off a portion of the padded flooring. The damaged portion measured 10 cm by 4 cm and cost $2,480 to repair. A psychiatrist report from the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) stated that the accused person was an abuser of benzodiazepines and alcohol, and that he was probably intoxicated with them, plus cough syrup, at the time of the offence. The report also stated that he did not suffer any psychotic illness at the time and was not of unsound mind. He was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment.

25     Significantly, he was traced for, _inter alia_, offences of a similar nature -

> (i)     Two convictions for s 20, Cap 184 (disorderly behaviour) in 2005;

> (ii)     Two convictions for s 426 PC (mischief) in 2005 and 2010;

> (iii)     One conviction for s 336 PC (rash act that endangers life or personal safety of others) in 2006.

26     In _Goran Jeremic_ (at \[9\]), the accused person was drunk and had behaved in a disorderly manner at Zouk. He was also aggressive towards the staff of Zouk. He was advised to calm down by police officers but he refused. In the course of his arrest and conveyance to Central Police Division Headquarters, he had verbally abused a police officer. Whilst in the police cell, he ripped the padding from the floor of the cell, causing damage that cost $12,153.52. He was a first offender. He was sentenced to three weeks’ imprisonment.

27     The facts in _Lim Hock Soon_ were far more egregious than the present case on two counts; firstly, he had similar previous convictions and, secondly, the act of mischief was brazen in that he committed it when he was placed under arrest and was in police custody. _Goran Jeremic_ was closer to the present case and therefore more useful as a guide. In _Goran Jeremic_, the offender had been intoxicated when he committed the offence, although I noted that, like the offender in _Lim Hock Soon_, he had also committed the offence while in police custody. Using _Goran Jeremic_ as a guide, I was of the opinion that the starting point should be two months’ imprisonment. This was because the present case was placed somewhere in between _Lim Hock Soon_ and _Goran Jeremic_, but it was more egregious than the latter case on account of the public interest considerations. I noted the three significant mitigating factors present, namely, genuine remorse and contrition, full restitution made early, and his conduct was an aberration from his otherwise good character. These significant mitigating factors warranted a significant downward revision from the starting point. Therefore, I imposed a sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment on the Accused. I was of the opinion that this sentence adequately addressed the deterrence principle.

28     Both parties have appealed against the sentence. The Accused is on bail pending the outcome of the appeal.
