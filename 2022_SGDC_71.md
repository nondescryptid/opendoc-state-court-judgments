5 April 2022

### District Judge Teoh Ai Lin:

1       The accused Miah Motaleb a Bangladeshi national aged 31 years claimed trial to one charge of consuming methamphetamine on or before 9 March 2020 under section 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the MDA”).

2       I convicted and sentenced the accused to the mandatory minimum of one year’s imprisonment. The accused appeals against conviction and sentence and is on bail pending appeal.

## The Charge

3       The accused was charged as follows:

> DAC 907001-2020

> You… are charged that you, on or before 9 March 2020, in Singapore, did consume a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”), to wit, methamphetamine, without authorisation under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder, and you had thereby committed an offence under section 8(b)(ii) and punishable under section 33(3A) of the MDA.

## Background

4       The accused was in Singapore on work permit as a shipyard worker. In 2019 he had an accident in the course of work and made a claim for compensation with the Ministry of Manpower. He was placed on special pass and was not working at the time of his arrest.

5       The accused was arrested in the early morning hours of 9 March 2020 at Lorong 19 Geylang. Two other Bangladeshi nationals, Md Mizanur Rahman (“Mizanur”) and Shepon, were arrested with him.[^1]

6       Urine samples were taken from the accused at the Bedok Police Division on the morning of 9 March 2020. His instant urine test was positive for amphetamine.[^2] Subsequently two analysts from the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) issued two certificates pursuant to section 16 of the MDA which stated that the accused’s urine samples contained methamphetamine.[^3]

## Overview of the parties’ cases

### Prosecution’s case

7       Prosecution called seven witnesses, which included the arresting officers, the officers involved in the urine collection, and the HSA analysts. Prosecution relied on the presumption of consumption in section 22 of the MDA.

### Defence

8       The accused elected to give evidence and did not call any witnesses. He denied that he had consumed methamphetamine and said he did not know why his urine tested positive. The defence was that his drink could have been spiked, or he had passively inhaled when he was in a car with persons who could have been smoking drugs. The defence also alluded to some irregularities in his urine procurement.

## Evidence for the prosecution

### Circumstances leading to the arrest of the accused on 9 March 2020 at Geylang Lorong 19

9       PW1 Chiam Dao Xian a Deputy Chief Superintendent of Customs was the Ops Commander. He said that in the early morning hours of 9 March 2020 Customs was conducting a duty-unpaid cigarettes operation on the suspect Mizanur (one of the two men arrested with the accused on 9 March 2020).

10     At 1.30am on 9 March 2020, Mizanur was seen driving his blue Honda Vezel (“the Honda”) alone from his residence in Bukit Panjang to Kranji MRT station where he picked up five passengers. After that Mizanur drove to Jalan Kayu and all six persons in the Honda alighted. Customs kept observation on the Honda and did not follow the passengers. At 3am Mizanur and two passengers returned to the Honda, and the vehicle was driven to and reached Lorong 19, Geylang at about 330am. The Honda was stationery and at about 430am, one of three men was seen loading a bag into the boot of the Honda.

11     PW1 then called for his officers to move in and check the bag, suspecting that it contained duty-unpaid cigarettes. Mizanur was in the driver’s seat, Shepon was in the rear passenger seat and the accused was seated at the kerb beside the Honda. Two other men were seen behind the accused, but they ran away.

12     The bag was found to contain only clothing. PW1 spoke to Mizanur who said that he was helping his friend to move house. PW1 did not speak to the accused.

13     PW1 searched the vehicle and found suspected drug apparatus in the compartment between the front passenger and driver’s seat. This comprised two small flasks and four long straws.[^4] He suspected the liquid in one of the flasks contained drugs. No one admitted ownership or possession of the drug paraphernalia. PW1 called the police for assistance, and subsequently he handed over the matter to the police.

### Arresting officers at the scene on 9 March 2020

14     PW3 Staff Sergeant Sofri bin Abu Samah was one of the arresting officers and had lodged the arrest and seizure report.[^5]

15     PW3 was deployed to the scene at Lorong 19 Geylang with his partner and arrived at about 530am on 9 March 2020.

16     On arrival PW3 saw three men detained by the Customs officers near a blue Honda Vezel. PW3 called for further police resources and also called his team leader PW2 Mohamad Fazlin, who also proceeded to the scene subsequently and became the ground commander.

17     PW3’s partner searched Mizanur. PW3 spoke to Mizanur but he was slurred in speech and unsteady in gait and PW3 was unable to ascertain proper facts from him. PW3 did not speak to the accused but he had observed the accused to be very calm while Shepon was crying hysterically.

18     The team leader PW2 Mohamad Fazlin arrived at the scene at about 730am. He is currently an Assistant Superintendent of Police and was a team leader at Geylang Neighbourhood Police Center in March 2020.

19     On arrival PW2 saw that the Customs officers had detained three dark-skinned male persons, who were outside the car and separated.

20     PW2 searched the accused and aside from his personal effects, cash of $2000 plus was found on him. He spoke to the accused in broken English and the accused said the money was from his boss. The accused appeared a bit lethargic and a bit jittery. One of the other suspects with a moustache was hysterical. All three denied possession of the drug paraphernalia.

21     PW2 activated the K-9 unit to do a more thorough search. PW2 also conducted a manual search of the car in the presence of the three detained persons and found a small black straw nestled in the lumbar area of the driver’s seat.[^6]

22     PW2’s role was to supervise his police officers on the ground and he referred the matter to CNB, who made the decision to arrest the suspects. The suspects were escorted into the police cars, and PW2’s involvement ceased.

### Urine procurement and instant urine test at Bedok Police Division

23     PW4 Sergeant 3 Loh Wai Lon conducted the urine procurement from the accused on the morning of 9 March 2020 at about 945am.[^7] The accused was escorted to the toilet of the remand cell and asked to wash and dry his hands.

24     PW4 escorted the accused to the remand changing room and the accused was asked to choose a sealed master-bottle and two other sealed containers, which the accused carried.

25     The accused was then escorted to the toilet of the remand lock-up cell. He urinated into the master-bottle but was unable to provide a sufficient urine specimen. PW4 temporarily sealed the master-bottle and the two containers with masking tape and put them in a tamper-proof polymer bag which was returned to the accused. The accused was sent back to the lock-up cell.

26     At about 1014am, the accused said he could provide more urine and was escorted to the toilet of the remand cell carrying the sealed polymer bag. The accused urinated into the same master-bottle and this time the urine was 80ml or more and of sufficient volume.

27     PW4 asked the accused to transfer urine specimens from the master-bottle into each of the two containers. PW4 then temporarily sealed the master-bottle and the two containers, and the master-bottle was placed in a tamper-proof polymer bag[^8] and the two containers were placed in another bag. Both bags were handed to the accused.

28     The accused was then escorted to the CNB office next to the Bedok Police Division charge office for his instant urine test.[^9]

29     PW5 a CNB officer holding the rank of Station Inspector Mohamad Hafiz conducted the instant urine test at about 10.27am. He transferred some urine from the master-bottle into a test-tube. It tested positive for amphetamine.

30     At 1151am, the screening test result was ready and PW4 capped the two containers tightly and printed the accused’s name and FIN on two self-adhesive labels. The accused was asked to check and sign the labels, and PW4 affixed the labels to seal the two containers. The accused was asked to deposit the containers in different parts of the locked security box. The accused was escorted back to his cell and PW4 put the locked security box into the refrigerator in the CNB office.[^10] He then locked the refrigerator and put the key in the key box in the charge office.

31     The next day 10 March 20 at about 10am, CNB officer Narziyanto bin Isro collected two locked security boxes containing urine specimens from the CNB office and delivered them to the HSA at 1103am the same day.[^11]

### Both urine specimens tested positive for methamphetamine by two different HSA analysts

32     HSA analysts PW6 Goh Mei Ling Evelyn and PW7 Chan Si Jia issued certificates that the accused’s urine samples they had each tested contained methamphetamine.[^12]

33     PW6 testified that the methamphetamine concentration in the accused’s urine sample was 606 nanograms per millilitre of urine.[^13] PW7 testified that the methamphetamine concentration in the accused’s other urine sample was 602 nanograms per millilitre.[^14]

34     PW6 said that the HSA cut-off was 500 nanograms per millilitre of urine, and a positive certificate would be issued if the methamphetamine concentration was greater than the cut-off.

## The accused’s evidence

### With Mizanur in his car on Saturday 7 March 2020

35     The accused said Mizanur his friend was the driver of a Grab car.[^15] The accused was in Mizanur’s car on 7 March 2020.

36     Mizanur came to Tuas at about 5 to 6pm on 7 March 2020 and asked the accused to sit inside his car. The accused sat at the rear with two other persons. There was another person in the front seat who asked to go to Penjuru, where two persons alighted from the car.

37     Then they went to Mustafa – Mizanur was driving and Mizanur’s friend Khashim was with them. They had dinner in the Mustafa area.[^16] The accused was dropped off at 11pm to Pioneer where his dormitory was. He did not pay for the trip but Khashim paid Mizanur.[^17]

38     During his cross-examination the accused said that he had seen Mizanur and Khashim smoke cigarettes that day. He also suspected that something was mixed in the water that was given to him.[^18]

### The accused’s account of the events of 8 and 9 March 2020

39     The accused testified that he was with his friend Mosharaf on the night of 8 March 2020 up until his arrest on 9 March 2020. He denied that he was inside Mizanur’s car at any time on 8 or 9 March 2020 prior to his arrest.

40     The accused said that he had eaten with his friend Mosharaf at the Mustafa area on the night of 8 March 2020. At around 1030pm he went to Geylang where Mosharaf was staying. Mosharaf told the accused to stay over with him in Geylang even though the accused wanted to go back to his own dormitory at Tuas. [^19]

41     Mosharaf asked the accused to follow him to a Bangladeshi canteen at Lorong 23 Geylang where they drank water. Then they went to a room in Lorong 19 Geylang until about 2am on 9 March 2020.

42     Sometime after 2am Mosharaf and the accused went downstairs to meet a few of Mosharaf’s friends. Mosharaf was talking to them. There was a car parked along the roadside. Mosharaf’s friend came out of the car and gave Mosharaf a can of coke. Mosharaf drank from the can and passed the half can of Coke to the accused. The accused drank from it and threw the can away.[^20] Mosharaf also gave the accused a cigarette and the accused smoked it.[^21]

43     The accused was sitting along the roadside at the rear of the car, which belonged to Mizanur.[^22] Another car came and some persons came out showing their identification cards. Mosharaf told the accused to leave, if not there will be problem.[^23]

44     Mosharaf and his friend then left, and the accused was about to leave when he was detained. He showed them his special pass. The police were checking Mizanur’s car. Shepon who was seated at the rear of the car was asked to come out. The accused was asked whether he knew Mizanur and Shepon. The accused said that he knew Mizanur for some time as he is a Bangladeshi, and he had seen Shepon at his dormitory.

45     Uniformed police officers came and the accused, Mizanur and Shepon were taken to Bedok Police Station in separate cars.

46     The accused said that he was brought to the toilet and was unable to provide sufficient urine. The officer took the container from him and kept it with him and the accused didn’t know where the container was kept. He was then brought back to the lock-up. He drank more water and was brought back to the toilet and given the same bottle to pass urine.[^24]

47     He could not remember whether he returned the container to the officer or the officer held on to the packet and the accused put the container inside. His urine sample was poured out into two smaller bottles, but he could not remember whether he poured it or the officer did the pouring. He was then brought to the CNB office with the plastic packet for his instant urine test but he was not informed anything.[^25]

48     Then he was brought back to the lock-up. The accused confirmed that his name and FIN number were written on the sticker which was pasted on the containers and he placed the two containers into separate holes in a small box.[^26]

### Denied consuming drugs in his police statements

49     The accused denied consuming any drugs and said he did not know why his urine was positive in his first statement recorded on 9 March 2020, the afternoon of the day of his arrest.[^27]

50     In his subsequent two statements recorded on 26 March 2020 after he was shown the two positive HSA certificates, he again denied that he had consumed any controlled drugs and he did not know why his urine samples tested positive. [^28]

## Issues for determination

51     Section 22 of the MDA which Prosecution relied on provides as follows:

> **Presumption relating to urine test**

> 22.    If any controlled drug is found in the urine of a person as a result of both urine tests conducted under section 31(4)(_b_), he shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have consumed that controlled drug in contravention of section 8(_b_).

52     As the Court of Appeal in _Mohammad Ashik bin Aris v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 802</span> (“_Mohammad Ashik_”) observed at \[10\], if there are positive results from both the urine tests carried out in compliance with section 31(4)(b) of the MDA, section 22 will operate to presume that the accused had consumed the controlled drug detected in his urine samples in contravention of section 8(b). Section 22 presumes both the _actus reus_ and the _mens rea_ of the consumption offence.

### Irregularities in urine procurement and the section 22 presumption

53     Allegations of irregularity in urine procurement would not affect the triggering of the section 22 presumption, as the urine test referred to in section 31(4)(b) does not encompass the urine procurement process: _Zheng Jianxing v AG_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 120</span> at \[30\] and \[31\], and _PP v Mohammad Ashik bin Aris_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 34</span> at \[31\] and \[33\] and \[241\] to \[243\].

54     The Court of Appeal in _Mohammad Ashik_ had ruled that the urine test under section 31(4)(b) would only include certain processes conducted at the HSA laboratory. Therefore any irregularities in the urine procurement process would only be relevant in rebutting the presumption after it had been triggered.

### No dispute about urine tests conducted by HSA

55     The accused did not dispute that the urine tests were conducted in accordance with section 31(4)(b). The section 22 presumption was therefore triggered upon both the urine tests carried out in compliance with section 31(4)(b) of the MDA testing positive.

56     Once the presumption was triggered the burden of proof fell on the accused who would have to disprove either the _actus reus_ or the _mens rea_ of the offence on a balance of probabilities. It was insufficient if the accused merely raised a reasonable doubt: _PP v Cheng Siah Johnson v PP_ \[2002\] 1SLR(R) 839 at \[15\] citing _Vadugaiah Mahendran v PP_ \[1995\] 3 SLR (R) 917.

### Issues

57     Based on the allegations raised by the accused, the following issues were raised for determination by the court:

> (a)     Was there spiking of the accused’s drinks?

> (b)     Was there passive inhalation by the accused?

> (c)     Were there irregularities in the urine procurement process?

## Assessment of Evidence and Findings

### Vague and inconsistent spiking claims

#### What was spiked and circumstances of spiking not raised in evidence in chief

58     In his evidence in chief the accused merely gave an account of his activities and the persons he was hanging out with on 7, 8 and 9 March 2020. He only mentioned two instances of consuming drinks during this period – drinking water at a Bangladeshi canteen in Geylang with his friend Mosharaf on 8 March 2020 and drinking from a can of Coke on 9 March 2020 before the police arrived[^29]. However he did not testify that the water or the Coke could have been spiked.

59     He said only that he did not know why drugs were found in his urine sample and he “suspected” that maybe somebody “mixed with my drink” and unknowingly he drank it.[^30] His evidence in chief was non-specific as to when or how the spiking could have occurred between 7 to 9 March 2020, which of his drinks he suspected to be spiked, nor the possible spiker. This was despite counsel having put a specific case to the two HSA analysts that the spiking had occurred “a day earlier” before his arrest.[^31]

60     It was only during the accused’s cross-examination when prosecution referred him to his counsel’s put case to PW6 about his drink being spiked on 8 March 2020 that the accused then raised for the first time in his testimony that he suspected they had mixed drugs in the can of Coke which was passed to him on 9 March 2020 before the police arrived.[^32]

#### Fleeting claims also made about his water being spiked on 7 March 2020

61     There was no mention in the accused’s evidence in chief that he had drank anything or that anyone had passed him any drinks during his 7 March evening outing with Mizanur.[^33]

62     However during his cross-examination when Prosecution asked the accused whether he was saying that he had consumed any spiked drinks on 7 March 2020 that the accused then claimed that he had also drank water on 7 March which was given to him, and he suspected that something was mixed with this water.[^34] Even then at this point he did not say who had given him the water or when and where he had consumed this water during his 7 March 2020 outing.

63     He then quickly retracted this spiking claim after it was drawn to his attention by Prosecution that his counsel had put it to PW6 that his drink was laced with methamphetamine on 8 March 2020 and not 7 March 2020. In response the accused then mentioned Khashim’s name and said he did not suspect the water was spiked because Khashim had bought the water from a shop, and said maybe he had made a mistake.[^35]

Spiking on 7 March 2020 inconsistent with put case and Case for Defence

64     Not only did the accused prevaricate about alleged spiking taking place on 7 March 2020, but the claim was also inconsistent with the case put by counsel to both the HSA analysts and appeared to be an opportunistic attempt to cast his net further on his spiking claims.

65     It was not put to either HSA analysts that the accused’s drinks could have been spiked on 7 March 2020. The put case to PW6 was that his instructions were that the accused could have consumed a “drink” laced with methamphetamine “a day earlier”.[^36] As the accused was arrested on 9 March 2020, this would be a reference to 8 March 2020. Subsequently counsel had also put it to PW7 that his instructions were that the accused had consumed _a can of Coke_ he had shared with someone on _8 March 2020_ which could have been spiked with methamphetamine.[^37]

66     The accused’s fleeting allegation about his water being spiked on 7 March 2020 was also inconsistent with the Case for Defence. There was nothing mentioned in the Case for Defence suggesting that spiking could have occurred on 7 March 2020.

67     Spiking was raised in the Case for Defence which stated that as the accused was in the company of individuals “who may have been popping drugs in the form of tablets or through drinks”, there was a distinct possibility someone could have laced some “soft drinks” without the accused’s knowledge as the accused had consumed “soft and alcoholic drinks on the night before”[^38].

68     This allegation of drinking spiked water on 7 March 2020 was inconsistent with the Case for Defence not only as to when the spiking had taken place, but also that it was soft drinks that had been spiked. By the time of the closing submissions, there was only a brief and general reference to spiking of drinks without any reference as to when the spiking occurred or what drink had been spiked.[^39]

#### Spiking account about the can of Coke internally and externally inconsistent

##### The can of Coke

69     The accused had given a shifting account about who passed the can of Coke to Mosharaf and whether Mosharaf had drank from it before passing the can to the accused.

70     In his evidence in chief the accused first said that Mosharaf’s friend came out of Mizanur’s car, and it was “Mosharaf’s friend” who gave Mosharaf a can of Coke. Mosharaf drank from the can of Coke and passed the can to the accused. The accused then smoked a cigarette that Mosharaf had given him before the customs officers came.[^40]

71     However the details about this can of Coke changed in the course of his testimony. When his counsel asked him where did Mosharaf get the can of Coke from, this time the accused replied that it was “Mizanur’s friend” who passed the Coke to Mosharaf. He then suddenly also claimed that he did not see whether Mosharaf drank from the can of Coke as he was sitting down and looking at his handphone. He also did not see who opened the can of Coke - it could have been “Mosharaf’s friend” who was inside the car.[^41] He maintained in cross-examination that he did not notice whether Mosharaf drank from the can of Coke.[^42]

##### Spiking claims about the can of Coke inconsistent with Case for Defence and put questions

72     The spiking defence stated in the Case for Defence was that as the accused was in the company of individuals “who may have been popping drugs in the form of tablets or through drinks”, someone could have laced soft drinks as the accused had consumed soft and alcoholic drinks the night before.

73     Consistent with the Case for Defence, the put questions to both HSA analysts were that the accused had consumed a can of Coke which could have been laced _the day before_ his arrest[^43], which would be a reference to 8 March 2020 as the accused was arrested in the early morning hours of 9 March 2020.

74     However the accused claimed to have drank from a spiked can of Coke on 9 March 20 before the Custom officers arrived. Contrary to the Case for Defence and the put questions, it was not any part of his testimony that he had drank any _Coke or soft drinks or alcoholic drinks_ on _8 March 2020_. Instead the only drink he specifically testified to have consumed on 8 March 2020 was _water_ at the Bangladeshi canteen with Mosharaf.

75     Neither did the accused claim that he had been with anyone who could have been or suspected to be taking drugs in whatever form on the 8 and 9 March 2020 as the Case for Defence claimed. Under cross-examination the accused said it was just his suspicion that someone mixed drugs in the form of tablet or any other form into his drink.[^44]

76     When the Case for Defence about persons popping tablets was surfaced to him during cross-examination, the accused denied that he had seen anyone taking drugs in the form of tablets and also denied that anyone had given him any tablets.[^45] As regards the drug paraphernalia found in Mizanur’s car, this was neutral as there was nothing in evidence that it had been used by any of his associates that evening. The accused also claimed that he had spoken to Mizanur and Shepon after their arrest and they told him their urine tested positive.[^46] However the accused had denied being in the car with either of them on 8 or 9 March 20, neither did he link the can of Coke to either of Mizanur or Shepon. In any event, he did not suggest that these associates were engaged in drug-taking when he was with them on 9 March 2020 before the customs officers arrived. His account was devoid of any supporting substratum of credible facts to support his claim that his Coke had been unknowingly laced by people taking drugs.

#### Dissociative account of activities and the people he had been with

77     A dissociative quality pervaded the accused’s account of his activities and his associates.

##### His association with Mizanur

78     The accused prevaricated about his relationship with Mizanur who he referred to as Mizan, a Bangladeshi and the driver of a Grab car[^47]. In his testimony the accused variously described Mizanur as “my friend” [^48], but also said that he was “not very close to him and he was just “an acquaintance”[^49]. In his police statement he said that Mizanur was a mutual friend and he did not know him very well.[^50]

79     He also gave a sketchy account of the time he spent with Mizanur on the evening of 7 March 2020 although he had been with Mizanur for a substantial period from 5pm to 11pm that evening.

80     He said that Mizanur had come to Tuas near his dormitory and it was Mizanur who “asked me to sit inside the car”[^51]. He did not answer the question his counsel asked him as to whether they were planning to go somewhere but merely gave an account of travelling in Mizanur’s car going to various places with various passengers, before going to Mustafa for dinner with Mizanur and one Khashim who he described as “Mizanur’s friend”[^52].

81     His interactions with Mizanur on 7 March 2020 suggested that Mizanur was at the least someone known to and socially familiar with the accused. He had been out socially with Mizanur just two days before his arrest, and was again with Mizanur at the time of his arrest. Moreover the accused had been driven to and from his dormitory that evening without the need to make any payment to Mizanur even though Mizanur was a Grab driver and Khashim had made payment.[^53]

82     The accused’s prevarications about his associates extended also to Shepon, who was arrested at the same time as the accused. In his police statement he said Shepon stayed in his dormitory and he was “my friend” and they worked in the same shipyard.[^54] However in court he described Shepon as someone he had seen his dormitory and that he did not know him for long[^55].

##### His friend Mosharaf

83     The accused denied being in the car with Mizanur and Shepon on 8 or 9 March 2020 and said he had been with his friend Mosharaf.

84     As the accused had mentioned this Mosharaf in his first police statement[^56] it was plausible that the accused had been with Mosharaf that evening. Although PW1 had testified that the accused had been with Mizanur and Shepon when they boarded Miah’s car at Jalan Kayu at about 3am on 9 March 2020, PW1 also said that he first saw the accused at Lorong 19 Geylang when they moved in for the arrest. PW1 agreed with counsel that it was possible that he could have been mistaken about observing the accused boarding Mizanur’s vehicle at Jalan Kayu.[^57]

85     The dissociative tone the accused adopted pervaded his account of his activities with Mosharaf on 8 and 9 March 2020 as well. He portrayed Mosharaf as playing a leading and central role in their activities and he was just following Mosharaf about.

86     The accused said that on the evening of 8 March 2020 he had been at Mustafa with Mosharaf, and then left Mustafa for Geylang at about 10pm to 1030pm. After he reached Geylang he told Mosharaf he wanted to return to his dormitory but it was Mosharaf who told him to stay with him in Geylang. Mosharaf then told the accused to accompany him to Lorong 23, Geylang to meet his friend and they drank water at a Bangladeshi canteen. Then Mosharaf brought him to a room in Lorong 19 Geylang where they stayed until 2am and they later went down to meet “Mosharaf’s friends”[^58].

87     The accused described this group of people he met at Geylang Lorong 19 as “Mosharaf’s friends” and there was “a car” parked along the road and “Mosharaf’s friends” came out of the car, and then “Mosharaf’s friend” gave Mosharaf a can of Coke.[^59]

88     However as more details emerged, the “a car” the accused referred to was in fact Mizanur’ car in which he had ridden just on 7 March 2020. In fact nearly all the persons the accused described as “Mosharaf’s friends” were known to and also the accused’s associates. This group included Mizanur, and Shepon who lived in the accused’s dormitory and who the accused had described as his friend.[^60] Aside from Mizanur and Shepon, the only two other persons mentioned in evidence as being present that evening but who had left the scene before they could be detained[^61] included the accused’s friend Mosharaf.

##### Other inconsistencies in account of his activities on 8 and 9 March 2020

89     There were also other inconsistencies between his testimony about his interactions with Mosharaf that night and his first police statement recorded on 9 March 2020.

90     In court the accused said that on 8 March 2020 he had been in Mustafa to eat with Mosharaf and Mosharaf’s friend. The accused also told the court that when they saw the custom officers’ car, it was Mosharaf who told him to leave as “it will be problem”[^62]. However in his police statement the accused said that he was hanging out in Mustafa and then received a call from Mosharaf who asked him to go to Geylang and he met up with Mosharaf in Geylang.[^63] In his police statement the accused said that it was the accused who sensed some danger and he had told Mosharaf to leave.[^64] As for Mosharaf who had left the scene before he could be detained, the accused was also vague about the whereabouts of his friend and said that “maybe” Mosharaf had left Singapore already[^65].

91     These inconsistencies were by themselves minor in nature. However taken together with the pervasive dissociative tone which imbued the accused’s entire account, the accused seemed to be deliberate distancing himself from his associates and their activities.

#### Rejected the accused’s spiking claims

92     Prosecution had submitted that an adverse inference should be drawn from the lack of any mention of spiking in the accused’s police statements[^66] However I regarded the non-mention of the spiking as neutral, in particular as regards his first police statement which was recorded on the afternoon of his arrest. The accused had denied taking drugs and spiking may not necessarily surface to an accused’s mind until he had time to contemplate the events surrounding his positive urine test.

93     However having assessed the accused’s demeanour and the totality of his evidence in the round, I found the accused to be a shifting and inconsistent witness who gave an account lacking in cogency, and I rejected his claims.

94     His fleeting retracted claims of spiking on 7 March 2020 were opportunistic, being inconsistent with the Case for Defence and the put questions by his own counsel.

95     As for the alleged spiking from the can of Coke on 9 March 2020, I was of the view that his claim about having drunk from a can of Coke passed to him by Mosharaf before his arrest on 9 March 2020 was a fabrication to bolster his denials of consuming drugs. His bare assertions of drinking from this can of Coke were riddled with internal and external inconsistencies which have been discussed in the preceding paragraphs. Further even if this can of Coke really existed and Mosharaf had passed it to him to drink, it was pure surmise that the can of Coke was spiked. As the court in _Cheng Siah Johnson v PP_ \[2002\]1 SLR(R) 839 observed, allegations of spiking are extremely easy to make and almost impossible to debunk and a judge should approach such a defence with greater caution and circumspection than usual in the absence of any other credible evidence: at \[15\].

### Passive inhalation in the car an afterthought

96     Passive inhalation was only raised for the first time during the trial when counsel put it to the _second_ HSA analyst PW7 who took the stand. Counsel had put it to PW7 that the accused had sat in a vehicle “a day before”[^67] and could have passively inhaled when someone had smoked methamphetamine in the vehicle.

97     Up until then, there was no mention in the Case for Defence that the accused had been in a car with persons who could have smoked drugs, nor any mention of the possibility of passive inhalation.[^68] Neither did counsel put the issue of passive inhalation to the first HSA analyst PW6 who had taken the stand the day before PW7.[^69]

98     Despite counsel’s put to PW7 which he specifically said was based on the accused’s instructions that the accused had been in a car “a day before”, when the accused eventually took the stand in his defence, he denied that he was in Mizanur’s car or in any car the day before his arrest. He claimed he had been in Mizanur’s car only on 7 March 2020, which was _two days_ before his arrest on 9 March 2020.

#### Not the accused’s evidence that anyone had been smoking in the car

99     Aside from the time discrepancy as to when the passive inhalation in the car had taken place, during the accused’s own evidence in chief, he had only given an account of being in a car driven by Mizanur with other passengers on the evening of 7 March 2020. Notably he _made no mention whatsoever_ that anyone had been smoking in the car, or for that matter, there was anyone smoking in his presence on the evening of 7 March 2020.[^70]

100    It was only during the accused’s cross-examination when Prosecution sought to clarify with the accused whether he was making any allegations that anyone was taking drugs in his presence on 7 March 2020 that the accused made vague and tentative references about seeing “them” smoke on 7 March 2020. I reproduce the brief exchange he made as regards his passive inhalation claims below[^71]:

>   
| 

Q

 | 

So, between 5 to 6---sorry. Between 5 to 11 PM, you are not alleging that anyone took drugs in your presence, correct?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I have seen to smoke but since I know what is drug and what does it look like, so I don’t know about this.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

But you’re now saying that the smoke contains drugs, correct?

 |
| 

Singh:

 | 

Your Honour, may I ask my learned friend to clarify which smoke he is referring to?

 |
| 

Tan:

 | 

Your Honour, the accused said that he has seen smoke. That was with reference to his last answer.

 |
| 

Singh:

 | 

Very well.

 |
| 

A

 | 

I have seen them to smoke cigarette.

 |
| 

Singh:

 | 

Very well.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Sorry? “I have seen them to smoke”?

 |
| 

Interpreter:

 | 

To smoke cigarette.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Who is “them”?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

By “them”, I am referring to ‘Khashim’ and Mizan.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

By Mizan, you are referring to Mizanur?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes, it is Mizanur.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

You have no reason to suspect that the cigarette contains drugs, correct?

 |
| 

Q

 | 

No, my question was, you have no reason to suspect that they contain drugs.

 |
| 

A

 | 

Since I have not seen what is drug and how does it look like, then, I cannot say that they are taking drug or not.

 |

  
  

101    In gist, the accused claimed that he saw Mizanur and Khashim smoke cigarettes. However he did not once say that Mizanur and Khashim were smoking whilst they were in the car with him, nor when or where this smoking had taken place during the 7 March 2020 evening outing. His bare claims about Mizanur and Khashim smoking fell far short of the put case by counsel that the accused had been _in the car_ with persons who could have been smoking drugs. Neither did counsel further seek to clarify or elicit further details about the accused’s cursory allegations about the persons smoking during re-examination. In any event, even if Mizanur and Khashim had been smoking on 7 March 2020, it was entirely speculative that Mizanur and\\or Khashim were smoking drugs that evening. The presence of drug paraphernalia in the car was neutral, and there was nothing to suggest that it had been used on 7 March 2020.

102    I found the accused’s claims about Mizanur and Khashim smoking on 7 March 2020 to be an afterthought. The accused’s own testimony did not support the put case that he had been in a car, whether on 7 March 2020 or 8 March 2020, with persons smoking methamphetamine and which he could have passively inhaled. In any event, even if the accused had indeed been in a car with persons who were smoking drugs, it was purely speculative that passive inhalation could have taken place in that manner. The Defence claim in the closing submissions[^72] that the drug concentration in the accused’s urine was marginally above the cut-off point lent weight to the passive inhalation claims were bare assertions. PW7 the HSA analyst had testified that there was no study or literature about passive inhalation of methamphetamine, and she was not able to comment on the scenario posed by counsel to her about passive inhalation of methamphetamine in a vehicle.[^73]

### Inconsistent and half-hearted attempts to impugn the urine procurement process

103    Although counsel had put a series of alleged irregularities to PW4 in cross-examination, the majority of these alleged irregularities were not even raised by the accused in his testimony.

104    Counsel had put it to PW4 that the accused was not asked to wash and dry his hands, that it was PW4 who chose the two containers for the accused, that it was PW4 who transferred the urine from the master bottle to the two containers, and that the two containers were left on the table and not handed to the accused.[^74]

105    As regards the put question to PW4 that it was the officer who had poured the urine from the master-bottle into the two containers, the accused in his examination in chief said that he himself had poured the urine from the master-bottle into the two containers, but then changed his testimony to say that he could not recall whether it was poured by him or the officer.[^75] However in cross-examination the accused agreed with prosecution that he had transferred the urine from the master -bottle into the two containers.[^76]

106    In the accused’s examination in chief the only allegation he made about the urine collection process was that after his urine sample was found to be insufficient, the officer took the master container from him and kept it with him.[^77] On this, PW4 had given a detailed and cogent account that he had temporarily sealed the master bottle and the two containers in a tamper-proof bag and returned the bag to the accused.[^78] PW4 further testified in response to counsel that after the accused returned to his cell the tamper-proof bag was placed outside his cell in a dedicated box.[^79]

107    When Prosecution had put it to the accused that the urine specimen he provided came from him and no one else and that there were no irregularities in the urine collection process, the accused had agreed. Counsel did not further seek to clarify with the accused whether this was otherwise in re-examination.[^80]

#### Allegations abandoned in Defence closing submissions

108    The Defence claims as to alleged urine procurement irregularities were half-hearted attempts to impugn the urine procurement process. In any event it was not actually clear what arguments were being advanced on behalf of the accused apart from the general denial that the accused did not consume drugs.

109    If Defence was suggesting that irregularities in the urine procurement process resulted in contamination or a break or mix-up in the urine procurement chain such that the urine specimen that tested positive was not the accused’s, this argument was not raised in his Case for Defence [^81] nor in the Defence closing submissions[^82].

110    In fact by the time of the closing submissions, nothing further was raised about any irregularities in the urine procurement process.

## Decision - Guilty and Convicted

111    The Prosecution relied on the section 22 MDA presumption of consumption. Once the presumption was triggered, the burden to rebut the _actus reus_ or _mens rea_ for the offence on the balance of probabilities lay on the accused. The accused had failed to discharge this burden.

112    I did not find the accused to be a credible witness and I found his spiking and passive inhalation claims to be baseless. I disbelieved his nebulous claims about Mosharaf passing him a can of Coke to drink before the customs officers arrived which could have been spiked. Not only were the passive inhalation claims purely speculative, notably it was not even any part of the accused’s testimony that he had been in a car with persons who were smoking whether on 7, 8 or 9 March 2020 for the alleged passive inhalation to have taken place. As for the accused’s urine procurement I accepted the evidence of the prosecution witnesses and was satisfied that the urine procurement procedures had been followed and that the urine samples sent to HSA which tested positive for methamphetamine belonged to the accused.

113    I therefore convicted the accused as charged.

## Parties’ submissions on sentence

### Prosecution submission

114    Prosecution said that it had no objection to the mandatory minimum of one year’s jail.

### Mitigation

115    The oral mitigation dealt mainly with the accused’s background and personal circumstances. The accused had been in Singapore for five years and a work permit holder earning $800 per month. He was the eldest child and supporting his family in Bangladesh.

116    Counsel said the accused’s instructions were to ask for a fine but counsel also conceded that a fine-alone sentence was not possible.

## Sentence

117    The punishment prescribed under section 33(3)(A) for a drug consumption offence under section 8(b)(ii) of the MDA carried an imprisonment term of not less than one year and not more than ten years, and the offender shall also be liable to a fine.

118    Counsel’s submissions did not raise anything of mitigating value. I noted that the accused was a first offender, and claiming trial was not an aggravating factor.

119    I was of the view that the mandatory minimum of one year’s imprisonment was appropriate and sentenced the accused accordingly. The sentence was backdated to his date of arrest on 26 March 2020, and to take into account his period of remand and to exclude the period he was on bail.
