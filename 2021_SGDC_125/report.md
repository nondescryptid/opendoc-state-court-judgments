\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9063/2021/01.\]

7 July 2021

### District Judge Shaiffudin Bin Saruwan:

## Introduction

1       It was common for jobseekers, both locals and particularly foreigners, to engage employment agents to help them secure employment in Singapore. This was because employment agents have the expertise to help them. In turn, the employment agents were expected to discharge their duties with integrity, probity, diligence and skills. Unfortunately, not every employment agent was committed to these values. Some unscrupulous agents took advantage of these vulnerable and desperate jobseekers by charging them exorbitant fees. Some foreigners have even been left stranded in Singapore when these agents reneged on their promises to find jobs, and then disappeared after pocketing the fees. In order to protect these jobseekers, the Employment Agencies Act (Cap 92, Rev Ed 2012)(“EAA”) was enacted to regulate the activities of employment agencies and agents. All employment agencies and agents were now required to hold a licence to operate.

## The charge

2       The Accused had claimed trial to one count of s 6(1) punishable under s 6(4)(a) of the EAA. The offence was one of carrying on an employment agency without a licence issued by the Commissioner for Employment Agencies. The periods of offence were from July to 28 September 2014, and 14 March to September 2016. The Accused was alleged to have sourced for employment in Singapore for 11 Bangladeshi nationals.

3       At the end of the trial, I convicted the Accused and fined him $40,000. The Accused had filed an appeal against conviction and sentence.

4       The prosection was led by Mr Amos Tan and Ms Sophia Lin from the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”). The defence was led by Mr Siraj Shaik Aziz and Ms Cheryl Ng from M/s Intelleigen Legal LLC.

## The trial

### Case for the prosecution

5       It was not disputed that pursuant to s 6(1) EAA, a person required a licence authorising him to carry on an employment agency[^1]. An “employment agency” was defined as any agency “…carried on or represented as being or intended to be carried on (whether for the purpose of gain or reward or not) for or in connection with the employment of persons in any capacity…”[^2]. It was the prosecution’s case that in sourcing employment for the 11 Bangladeshi nationals, the Accused had carried on an employment agency and therefore he required a licence to do so.

6       The prosecution relied primarily on the Accused’s admissions in his statement to MOM dated 2 May 2017 (“P42”). Mr Amos Tan also drew support from the consistencies between the contents of P42 and other extrinsic evidence, namely the emails found in the Accused’s email account (XXX@gmail.com), the Accused’s further statement to MOM dated 12 April 2018 (“P4”) and the evidence of the 11 Bangladeshi nationals.

7       The prosecution’s case was that the Accused was an employment agent in Bangladesh. When he came to Singapore sometime in 2014, he continued to act as an employment agent because he needed to earn extra money to clear his debts. The Accused was approached mainly by people from his village and his friends for help to find employment for them. He charged them fees between $2,500 to $3,000. Sometime in 2016, he entered into a joint business with one “Faruk”. Faruk was the Accused’s employment agent. The Accused’s role was to look for companies in Singapore who needed foreign workers, while Faruk’s role was to source for Bangladeshis who were looking to work in Singapore. Under this joint business, the Accused was paid between $100 to $200 for each worker. At the same time that he carried on the employment agency business in Singapore, he was also employed by various employers here. His employers were not aware of his side business.

8       In the course of acting as an employment agent, the Accused had received and/or sent numerous emails containing copies of passports, work certificates, and/or in-principle approvals (“IPA”) of various Bangladeshi nationals using his email account. All these documents were concerned with or were in connection to seeking employment in Singapore.

### Case for the defence

9       It was not disputed by the defence that the Accused’s email account showed a lot of traffic involving the documents set out in \[8\] above. However, Ms Cheryl Ng submitted that this did not conclusively pointed to the Accused’s guilt. The defence claimed that he had allowed his friends to use his email account and smartphone to sent these documents and papers to save cost. He had done this for two reasons; firstly, to help his friends save cost because if they had done this via an internet shop or café, they would have to pay fees; and secondly, some of this friends were IT-illiterate so he had helped them to do so.

10     Needless to say, the Accused had challenged the admissibility of P42. The challenge, as phrased in the defence written submissions at the end of the ancillary hearing, was two-fold. The first challenge was that the defence claimed that oppression had been exerted on him by the statement recorder, Investigation Officer Jocelyn Leong (“IO Jocelyn Leong”) in the course of recording P42. The oppression comprised –

> (a)     Oral threats, namely, IO Jocelyn Leong had threatened “I will call the police and you will go to jail now”;

> (b)     Non-verbal threats, namely, IO Jocelyn Leong had slammed the table and wagged or pointed her finger when she made the oral threats above;

> (c)     The Accused had felt uncomfortable because the room was very cold. His request for the thermostat to be adjusted was refused. Instead he was told that he could leave the room after he had signed P42.

> (d)     The Accused had been told that he must sign P42 because he had signed a previous similar statement which was also recorded by IO Jocelyn Leong and interpreted by Ms Syeda on 3 October 2016 (“the 3 Oct 16 statement”). He alleged that during the recording of the 3 Oct 16 statement, he had been shown the same documents and asked the same questions in relation to the documents as were done during the recording of P42. The Accused alleged that he had signed P42 on the basis of that belief.

11     The second challenge was that there were serious procedural irregularities in the recording of P42 such that its prejudical effect outweighed the probative value. These serious procedural irregularities were mainly tied to the allegation that P42 was not read back to the Accused in its entirety, but was instead cursorily summarised by Ms Syeda.

### Issue(s) to be determined

12     As such, the issues for determination, in chronological order, were –

> (a)     Were the threats made and/or inducements offered to the Accused by IO Jocelyn Leong during the recording of P42 such that they rendered P42 involuntary and therefore inadmissible?;

> (b)     Did the threats and/or inducements amount to oppression such that they had sapped the Accused’s free will to act?;

> (c)     Were there serious procedural irregularities in the recording of P42 such that the prejudicial effect of the statement outweighed its probative value to the extent that P42 should be excluded?

> (d)     Did the Accused act as an employment agent without a licence at the material time?

13     It was not disputed that the Accused had never held a licence to act as an employment agent or run an employment agency under the EAA at all material times. The question was whether he had acted as an employment agent.

### Analysis of the evidence

##### (1)   Admissibility of the Accused’s statement P42

14     It was not disputed that there were only three persons in the room during the recording of P42, and that throughout the recording process, no one else had entered the room. It was also not disputed that IO Jocelyn Leong had met the Accused and Ms Syeda at Hall B at the MOM Service Centre, Bendemeer Road, and thereafter all three had proceeded to the interview room[^3].

15     I was mindful that the prosecution had to prove that P42 was made voluntarily by the Accused without any threat, inducement, promise or any form of oppression. The standard of proof required was that of beyond reasonable doubt: see _Teo Yeow Chuah v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 2 SLR(R) 563</span> at \[20\].

(A)   Were there verbal and physical threats made to the Accused before and/or during the recording of P42?

16     IO Jocelyn Leong had denied making any threat. Ms Syeda had also denied that there were threats made during the recording of P42. According to IO Jocelyn Leong, P42 had been recorded from 2.31 pm to 5.00 pm. The Accused had chosen to speak in Bengali. Ms Syeda was the external interpreter. IO Jocelyn Leong testified that there was no difficulty in communication between the three of them. This was not disputed by the defence. P42 was recorded firstly in narrative form followed by the question and answer format. The Accused’s statements and responses were typed by IO Jocelyn Leong using her lap-top. In the course of the statement recording, the Accused was shown all the documents referred to in P42. The Accused had signed on each document as proof that they had been shown to him. The defence did not allege that he had not been shown the documents. At the end of the recording, IO Jocelyn Leong printed out a hard copy of the statement. The hard copy was then read back to the Accused in Bengali. IO Jocelyn Leong maintained that she had recorded down accurately whatever the Accused had said.

17     Ms Syeda was a Bengali interpreter of 20 years’ experience. She confirmed that in the course of the recording, she had interpreted what IO Jocelyn Leong had said to the Accused from English to Bengali, and then interpreted the Accused’s response from Bengali to English to IO Jocelyn Leong. She confirmed that P42 was an accurate interpretation of what the Accused had said to her during the recording process. She said that if there was a discrepancy or inconsistency in the Accused’s responses, it was not her job to question or clarify. She would merely interpret what he had said. She testified that both IO Jocelyn Leong and the Accused had behaved normally throughout the recording. She denied that IO Jocelyn Leong had acted aggressively towards the Accused. She confirmed that IO Jocelyn Leong had not made any threats to the Accused[^4]. She said that if such incidents had happened, she would have remembered them[^5].

18     I noted that the testimonies of both IO Jocelyn Leong and Ms Syead were internally and externally consistent. A close examination of the content of P42 and some aspect of the Accused’s testimony about the recording of P42 showed that their evidence that there was no threats made and that P42 was an accurate record of what the Accused had said was cogent and credible. Firstly, there were instances in P42 where IO Jocelyn Leong had recorded that the Accused had declined to give responses to some queries raised by her[^6]. P42 also showed instances where the Accused had denied knowing some of the people whose copies of passports were found in his email account. These were not consistent with the Accused’s potrayal of IO Jocelyn Leong as having pre-judged the Accused as guilty of the offence and was bent on him admitting to the offence. If she was truly of this disposition, then she would not have recorded these exculpatory statements. To butress this conclusion, I noted that the Accused himself had said that IO Jocelyn Leong had shown no reaction when he made these statements[^7]. All these were wholly inconsistent with the Accused’s potrayal of IO Jocelyn Leong and her bias against the Accused.

19     Compared to the consistent evidence of IO Leong and Ms Syeda, the Accused’s testimony in relation to his allegations of threats were inconsistent in many significant aspects. These inconsistencies were set out below.

20     During his examination-in-chief, in relation to the recording of P42, I noted that the specific allegations raised by the Accused were different in very significant ways. His allegations were that IO Jocelyn Leong had been a bit rude, had raised her voice at him[^8], and was angry at various points of the recording, for example, when he had refused to admit that he had taken commissions[^9] from the Bangladeshi nationals. He did not say that IO Jocelyn Leong had threatened to call the police and that he would go to jail. He did not say that IO Jocelyn Leong had slammed the table and wagged or pointed her finger. These omissions were significant given that these were the allegations pleaded in the defence’s submissions on the ancillary hearing. I concluded that these allegations were fabrications.

21     During his cross-examination, these omissions persisted. Instead the Accused had merely repeated that IO Jocelyn Leong had been angry for two reasons namely, because he had talked to Ms Syeda for too long for her liking[^10], and because he had disagreed with IO Leong that he had acted as an employment agent[^11]. Even when Mr Amos Tan had prompted him by asking him if IO Jocelyn Leong had raised her voice at him, he had replied that she was angry and “was slapping on the table” and had scolded him by pointing her finger at him for talking too much and had told him to look at her[^12]. Therefore, even at this stage of the cross-examination, and right through his re-examination, he did not say that she had threatened to call the police and that he would go to jail.

22     The threat to call the police first came up only in the Accused’s further statement to MOM on 24 August 2018 (“P31”). In P31, the Accused had alleged that IO Jocelyn Leong had slammed the table many times, and pointed her finger at him when he had denied some of the questions posed by her[^13]. She had also shouted at him and said that she would call for the police. But there was no allegation that IO Jocelyn Leong had threatened that he would go to jail. Instead, a new threat was added, which was, that she had asked him to take a polygraph test to see if he was lying. It was pertinent to note that the Accused had also stated that he could not recall exactly for which statement these threats had been made. All these points, coupled with my observations and conclusions in \[20\] and \[21\] above, cast serious doubts on the cogency and credibility of the Accused’s allegations.

23     It was also interesting to note that, if the Accused’s evidence was accepted as true, the exact same threats had been made to him by IO Jocelyn Leong when the alleged 3 Oct 16 statement was recorded. The Accused said that on 3 October 2016, IO Jocelyn Leong had become angry because she felt that he had talked far too long with Ms Syeda[^14]. IO Jocelyn Leong had shown her anger by “hitting on the table, pointing finger at \[him\]” and had asked him to look at her[^15]. Then on 2 May 2017, some seven months later, there was a repeat telecast of the events that transpired on 3 Oct 16. In other words, IO Jocelyn Leong had recorded the 3 Oct 16 statement from the Accused in the course of which she had shown him the emails and attachments found in his email account. Then on 2 May 2017, she had recorded P42 from him, in the course of which she had shown him the same emails and attachments and asked the same questions seven months ago. And in the course of the recording, she had made similar threats and offered similar inducements to him. I found this to be wholly inexplicable.

24     I rejected the Accused’s allegation that a statement had been recorded from him on 3 October 2016. It simply did not make sense. If IO Jocelyn Leong had already recorded a statement on 3 October 2016, there was no reason for her to record a similar statement covering the very same grounds all over again. In contrast, IO Jocelyn Leong could not remember having recorded a statement from the Accused on 3 Oct 16. Ms Syeda also testified that the first time she had met the Accused was when P42 was recorded. Lastly, and significantly, IO Jessie Lim, who had taken over the case from IO Jocelyn Leong, had testified that she had gone through the investigation papers for the case, including the relevant investigation diary maintained by IO Jocelyn Leong pertaining to the case, and she did not find any record of any statement having been recorded from the Accused on 3 October 2016 by IO Jocelyn Leong. There was no reason for me to reject IO Jessie Lim’s testimony on this.

25     The inconsistencies of the Accused’s evidence were further underscored by his further statement made on 12 April 2018 (“P4”). P4 was made some 11 months after P42 and four months before P31. It was recorded by IO Jessie Lim. P4 was interpreted by one Ms Shirin, a different interpreter. At the commencement of the recording of P4, the entirety of P42 was read back to the Accused. Significantly, the Accused had confirmed that the contents in P42 were true and accurate, save for the parts about him charging agency fees and getting commissions. In P4, the Accused did not mention about the alleged threats at all. In my mind, there was no reason for the Accused not to tell IO Jessie Lin about the threats. The Accused’s explanation for this significant omission was that he had told IO Jessie Lim about the threats but that she had not asked him for the details, and that was why the threats were not recorded in P4. I found the Accused’s explanation disingenuous and I rejected it. P4 was admitted into evidence by consent. No objection was raised against P4 on the basis that it had not been recorded accurately, or that IO Jessie Lim had not recorded down that he had mentioned the threats made by IO Jocelyn Leong. I also noted that the Accused had signed P4 after its contents had been read back to him. As such, the only reasonable conclusion I could make was that the Accused’s explanation about why there was no mention about the threats in P4 was quite obviously an afterthought.

(B)   Were there inducements offered to the Accused before and/or during the recording of P42?

26     The inducements offered, as pleaded in the defence’s submissions, were two-fold – one, that he had signed P42 because the interview room was so cold that it made him feel very uncomfortable, and he was told that he could leave the room only after he had signed P42, and two, he signed P42 because he was told that he should sign as he had signed the 3 Oct 16 statement, which was a similar to P42. Having examined and analysed the evidence adduced, I found that there was no inducement offered before and/or during the recording of P42.

27     The Accused’s case was that as he was troubled by the cold temperature in the room, he had informed Ms Syeda about it and requested her to ask IO Jocelyn Leong to increase the thermostat. He said that Ms Syeda had conveyed his request to IO Jocelyn Leong but it was rejected. He was told that he could leave the room if he signed P42. It was pertinent to note that the Accused had raised these allegations in the context of the 3 Oct 16 statement[^16]. There was no evidence from him that these inducements had also been offered during the recording of P42. In any event, in relation to the recording of P42, Ms Syeda had denied that the Accused had told her about the cold temperature in the room.She also denied that she had relayed the request to turn down the temperature but it was rejected[^17]. More importantly, it was not put to IO Jocelyn Leong that the Accused had made the request to her through Ms Syeda and that IO Jocelyn Leong had rejected his request. As such, I rejected the Accused’s claim that he had been induced into signing P42 because the room was extremely cold and he had signed P42 in order to leave the room. As I had made the finding that there was no 3 Oct 16 statement, I also rejected his claim that he had been induced into signing P42 because he had signed the 3 Oct 16 statement.

(C)   Was there oppression?

28     In view of the same discussion in the preceding paragraphs, it logically followed that there was no oppression on the Accused such that his free will was sapped when P42 was recorded.

29     In conclusion, I found that P42 was voluntarily made by the Accused. I therefore admitted P42 into evidence.

(D)   were there serious procedural irregularities?

30     The defence also contended there were serious procedural irregularities in the recording of P42 such that it should be excluded. These serious procedural irregularities pertained to the allegation that the contents of P42 was not read back to the Accused line by line. Instead Ms Syeda had merely summarised its contents in a cursory fashion, after which he was asked to sign P42. According to the defence, this allegation was supported by three points, namely -

> (a)     The presence of an obvious inconsistency or contradiction in P42 in relation to the issue of the fees that the Accused had charged or received as an employment agent. At \[3\] of P42, it was recorded that the Accused had charged between $2,500 to $3,000, whereas in the last paragraph at page 3 of P42, it was recorded that he was paid $100 to $200 for each foreign worker.

> (b)     The presence of obvious errors in P42 which would have been spotted if it had been read back line by line, but which had remained unamended. These errors were in the main typographical errors in the form of repetition of certain phrases and names.

> (c)     Given the length of P42, which comprised 21 pages, it was not possible that it took only 30 minutes to read the whole content of P42 back to the Accused.

31     In relation to sub-paragraph (a) above, a closer examination of P42 showed that there was no inconsistency or contradiction in the Accused’s statement about the fees. At \[3\] of P42, the $2,500 to $3,000 fees was in relation to the period 2014 to 2016 when the Accused had operated as an employment agent in Singapore. The $100 to $200 fees cited by him was in relation to the period when he was in a joint business with Faruk for about six months in 2016. In this joint business, Faruk’s role was to look for workers in Bangladesh while the Accused would look for companies in Singapore who needed foreign workers. According to the Accused, Faruk had charged each worker between $3,000 to $3,500, and the Accused received $100 to $200 from Faruk per worker. Therefore, there was no inconsistency or contradiction as contended by the defence. In any event, as IO Jocelyn Leong had explained, she had merely recorded what the Accused had told her. In my mind, this was consistent with IO Jocelyn Leong’s positin that she had faithfully recorded whatever the Accused had told her during the recording of P42.

32     In relation to sub-paragraph (b), I was of the view that simply because these errors which were typographical in nature had not been corrected did not necessarily mean that only a summary of the contents had been read back, and not the whole statement.

33     In relation to sub-paragraph (c), one needed to examine closely the composition of the content in P42. Almost half of P42 comprised references to numerous email addresses and the attachments retrieved from the Accused’s email account. The other half comprised the actual statements made by the Accused. That explained why the recording process took two and a half hours. The Accused would have been referred to the emails and attached documents, studied them to refresh his memory, and then gave his responses to questions posed by IO Jocelyn Leong. When P42 was read back to him, as he had already studied the emails and the attachments, and his memory refreshed. As such I did not find it inconceivable that it took only 30 minutes for the whole content of P42 to be read back to him.

34     Ms Syeda had testified that she had read the whole of P42 to the Accused. She had strenuously denied that she had only given a summary of the contents. The Accused had alleged in his testimony that she had lied to hide the fact that she had not read back the whole statement to him[^18]. I saw no reason for Ms Syeda, who had no vested interest in the case, to lie in court in relation to her evidence that she had read the whole of P42 to the Accused. It was also noteworthy that the allegation that Ms Syeda had lied to hide the fact that she had only summarised the contents was not put to her. On that basis, I found that the Accused’s allegation about Ms Syeda was an afterthought.

35     For the above reasons, I rejected the defence’s submission that there were serious procedural irregularities in the recording of P42, such that it should not be admitted into evidence on the basis that its prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value. I attached full weight to the contents in P42.

##### (2)   P42 - internally and externally consistent

36     In P42, the Accused had described the duration of his unlicensed employment agent activites on his for the period 2014 to 2016, and also when he entered into a joint business with Faruk for the period of six months in 2016. He had disclosed that he had started the employment agency activity when he was still in Bangladesh and had continued with the activity when he came to Singapore to work in 2014. He had described how he had used his email account and whatsapp to conduct his employment agency business. He had also disclosed that, over the period 2014 to 2016, he had acted as an employment agent for about 10 to 15 Bangladeshi nationals. He had charged fees ranging from $2,500 to $3,000 per worker.

37     The Accused knew that as an employment agent, he helped to facilitate and source for employment. He disclosed that he had continued with his employment agency activity when he came to Singapore to work because he wanted to earn extra income to pay his debts. He also disclosed that his employers in Singapore did not know about his employment agency activities. He also admitted that the copies of documents found in his email account were of those Bangladeshi nationals whom he was helping to source for employment in Singapore. The 11 Bangladeshi nationals who testified and whose documents were found in the Accused’s email account corroborated the Accused’s account in P42. They confirmed that their documents were furnished by them for the purpose of securing employment in Singapore.

38     I rejected the defence as set out at \[9\] above. I agreed with Mr Amos Tan that his evidence was self-contradicting and so inconsistent such that they cast serious doubts on his credibility. In relation to the documents found in his email account, the Accused had at first said that he did not know all the persons who had sent him emails[^19]. He had even offered an unbelievable account about how he had to leave his phone with his friend, one Pavel, for one week and he was not sure if Pavel had used his email account during this period[^20]. In fact, his position kept changing from not knowing these persons who had sent him the emails to knowing them, and subsequently agreeing that they were his friends[^21].

39     I noted that the Accused’s defence was not stated anywhere in P42, P4 and P31. Further, I rejected his testimony that he had told IO Jocelyn Leong about leaving his phone with Pavel but that she had not recorded this down in P42. This was because this allegation was never put to IO Jocelyn Leong. Also, the Accused had not called Pavel to corroborate his story. I concluded that the defence was contrived as it was wholy inconsistent with his statement in P42, where he had consistently stated that the emails and documents had been sent to him for the purpose of sourcing for employment.

##### (3)   The Accused’s testimony was not externally consistent

40     The Accused had stated that he did not know why the email and attachments in P2 were sent to him. The attachments in P2 were a copy of the passport and result slip belonging to Mamun Mohammad AL (“PW2”). His denial in court was inconsistent with his answer in P42 on the same matter. In P42 he had admitted that he was looking for a job for PW2. PW2 also confirmed in court that the documents were in relation to his attempt to find a job in Singapore. When confronted with these evidence, the Accused had to concede that his answer in P42 was consistent with what PW2 had said in court.

41     In court, the Accused had denied that he had said in P42 that he was in a joint business with Faruk and that Faruk had charged between $3,000 to $3,500 as his agency fees. However, Howlader Rubel (“PW4”) had testified that he was made aware of a job opening in a company in Singapore through the Accused who was a friend. He had then furnished his a copy of his passport and some certificates, including the in-principle approval (at P3), to the Accused and Faruk in order to secure the job. PW4 confirmed that that he had been introduced to Faruk by Kamal, and Faruk had quoted $3,000 as the agency fee[^22]. PW4’s evidence was therefore consistent with what the Accused had said in P42. As such, his denial flew in the face of the evidence.

42     For the above reasons, I found the Accused not to be a credible witness.

43     All considered, I found the Accused guilty of the charge and duly convicted him.

## Antecedents

44     The Accused was a first offender.

## The mitigation plea

45     Ms Cheryl Ng highlighted the Accused’s personal circumstances to the court. He came from a poor family and he first came to Singapore to work in 2011. He was the sole supporter of his elderly parents, who were in poor health. The Accused settled all their medical bills. In 2014, the Accused returned to Bangladesh to marry. When his wife was pregnant, he decided to return to Singapore to work in March 2016. This was because of his increasing financial commitments to his parents and his own family. His child was born in April 2016. Because of the present case, he had not gone home since.

46     He was currently employed as a construction worker with JMJ Consultants Pte Ltd, under the Temporary Job Scheme (“TJS”). TJS allowed workers, who were under investigations or who were charged in court, to work while they were emplaced on a Special Pass. The TJS pass was subject to renewal every six months. In his current employment, his monthly salary was approximately $1,000. He kept $200 for his own expenses here and remitted the rest to his family.

## The sentence

### The prescribed punishment

47     The prescribed punishment was a fine not exceeding $80,000 or to imprisonment not exceeding two years or both.

### Sentence by the court

#### General deterrence the dominant sentencing consideration

48     I agreed with the prosecution that general deterrence was the dominant sentencing consideration for the offence before me. This stood out clearly when the regulatory framework of the EAA was enhanced by the amendments which came into effect on 1 April 2011. The key consideration for the enhancements was the need for stronger regulations to tackle errant and unlicensed employment agents. The penalties for unlicensed agencies and agents were raised to ensure that they were commensurate with the potential gains from abuses and malpractices[^23].

49     Apart from the clear intention of Parliament, the present case also featured the four elements that generally attracted deterrence as set out in _Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> (“_Law Aik Meng_”). They were –

> (a)      Offence was committed against vulnerable victims. Unemployment agencies activities undermined the regulatory framework by competing with licensed law-abiding employment agencies. They also tended to exploit the vulnerable workers from developing countries by charging them exorbitant fees and might not give them the promised jobs in return. In the present case, the Accused had charged fees ranging from $2,500 to $3,000 per worker. And in the present case, seven of the foreigners were not successful in landing employment in Singapore.

> (b)      Prevalence of offence. The EAA amendments were also spurred by the prevalence of unlicensed employment agencies and agents. The Minister had observed that the increasing number of complaints received had led to the necessity for the amendments. The increase in malfeasance was attributable to the lucrative nature of such activities.

> (c)      Difficulty of detection/apprehension. The nature of the offence was such that it was difficult to detect. In the present case, the Accused’s offence was detected by chance when IO Jocelyn Leong was investigating into another case on 28 September 2016. By then, the Accused’s activities had gone on undetected for about two years and three months.

> (d)      The offence affected multiple victims. The present case involved 11 foreigners, seven of whom did not obtain employment despite having paid the high fees. In the context of the social background of these foreigners, the fees that they had paid represented a fortune.

50     I also agreed with Mr Amos Tan there were two offence-specific aggravating factors. These were – (i) the period of offence which spanned 10 months, and (ii) the profits that the Accused had enjoyed over this period.

51     There was no offender-specific factor which was significantly mitigating in this case.

#### Case precedents

52     I referred to a series of decided cases of s 6(1) EAA to distill some guidance on sentence.

53     The case that was closes in alignment with the present case was _International Placements (S) Pte Ltd v PP and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 46</span> (“_International Placements_”). In that case, the offender had earned management fees by arranging for nine foreign students to join the on-the-job training (“OJT”) programme at a company named DDPL. It had sourced for the foreign students, and collected and forwarded their biodatas to DDPL. The offender had also arranged for the interviews between DDPL and the foreign students, assisted in the preparation of the students’ work pass applications, which DDPL then submitted to MOM. It also managed the details of their accomodation in Singapore, upkeep and medical treatment, and also facilitated their return to their home countries. The foreign students were not under any contract of service during the OJT programme. They worked at DDPL’s stores, performed retail, management and stocking duties. The offender was convicted after a trial, and was sentenced to a fine of $40,000.

54     The trial judge had considered the following factors in arriving at the sentence –

> (a)     There was a deliberate intention to circumvent and undermine the regulatory framework under s 6(1) EAA (at \[85\]).

> (b)     Culpability was medium given that the quantum of the fees collected and the number of foreign students involved were significant (at \[86\]).

> (c)     Harm was low as all the foreign students had been emplaced, and there was no evidence of exploitation or that they or DDPL had been compromised by the unlicensed activity (at \[87\]).

> (d)     A stronger sentence was justified in view of the difficulty in detecting such offences (at \[88\]).

> (e)     The offender was not entitled to any sentencing discount as it had claimed trial to the charge (at \[89\]).

> (f)     The offender was a first offender (at \[95\]).

55     I was of the opinion that these factors applied with equal force in the present case, except for factor (c). In the present case, seven foreigners did not obtain employment.

56     In _PP v Lina Khoo Ling_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGDC 58</span> (“_Lina Khoo Ling_”), the offender had initially possessed a license to run an employment agency. She did not renew the license when it expired in end-March 2011. Nevertheless she continued to act as an employment agent from 1 April to 12 December 2011. She matched potential employees with prospective employers, assisted in the crediting of these employees via GIRO and continued to source potential employers for her clients. She emplaced a total of 38 employees with various employers and was paid agency fees of $1,200 for each successful emplacement. One similar charge was taken into consideration. She was fined $15,000.

57     In _PP v Arumugam Kannan_ (DAC 42617/2012)(“_Arumugam Kannan_”), the offender held a work pass to work as a construction worker. However, like the Accused, he had acted as an unlicensed employment agent and emplaced some 200 workers, of which only nine were identified. He had collected agency fees both in Singapore and India. He was fined $50,000.

58     In _PP v De Luna Noriza Dancel_ (DAC 47999/2011)(“_De Luna Noriza Dancel_”), the offender was the holder of an employment agent license for a company named RSD. She set up a second company named NWCD with her husband. NWCD was not licensed as a employment agency. Notwithstanding this, she conducted recruitment activities through NWCD. When investigations were conducted against her, and MOM did not renew her license in relation to RSD, she set up a third company named “Impact” in order to continue with her illegal recruitment activities. She also used another company to make online applications for work passes. A total of 23 persons were emplaced and $31,700 were collected as agency fees. She was fined $50,000

59     In my mind, the culpability of the Accused was similar to that of the offender in _International Placements_; which was medium culpability. As the High Court in that case had observed, in determining culpabilty, the number of trainees emplaced and the quantum of fees collected were relevant factors to consider. Like the offender in _International Placements_, the Accused’ role was more than just receiving and forwarding documents to a third party. As he had admitted in P42, he had looked for jobs for his friends and people in his village who had forwarded their documents to him. Apart from acting as an employment agent himself, he had also entered into a joint business with Faruk for six months in 2016. In this joint business, his role was to look for companies in Singapore who needed manpower while Faruk, who was based in Bangladesh, looked for workers in Bangladesh.

60     Ms Cheryl Ng’s argued that the Accused’s culpability was much lower than that of the offender in _International Placements_. She relied on the fact that the Accused had collected fees of around $1,100 to $1,200, as compared to $19,990 in _International Placements_. I disagreed and my reasons were set out below.

61     The Accused had disclosed in P42 that he had worked as an employment agent from 2014 to 2016. It was the Accused’s evidence that he charged $2,500 to $3,000 per worker. Then for about six months in 2016, he had concurrently gone into a joint employment agency business with Faruk. In this joint business, he received $100 to $200 per worker from Faruk. Of the 11 Bangladeshi nationals listed in the charge, only two were in relation to the joint business with Faruk. These were Howlader Rubel and Razzak. The Accused had stated that he had received the in-principle approvals for these two persons from Faruk[^24]. For these two, he would have received fees of between $200 ($100 x 2) and $400 ($200 x 2). The other nine were in relation to his own employment agency business. For these nine, he would have received fees between $22,500 ($2,500 x 9) and $27,000 ($3,000 x 9). On that basis, the total amount of fees collected by the Accused from these 11 Bangladeshi nationals ranged between $22,700 and $27,400. Therefore, even if we take the lower amount, it was more than the amount in _International Placements_.

62     Notwithstanding that, I was of the opinion that the appropriate fine in the present case should not be more than that imposed in International Placements, as the difference in the amounts involved were not so significant that a higher fine was warranted in the present case. As such I imposed a fine of $40,000 in default to serve 8 weeks’ imprisonment.

## Conclusion

63     The Accused has lodged an appeal against conviction and sentence. The Accused is currently on bail pending appeal. I ordered a stay of execution of the payment of the fine pending the outcome of the appeal.
