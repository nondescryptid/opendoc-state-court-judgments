### District Judge Shaiffudin Bin Saruwan:

## INTRODUCTION

The Accused pleaded guilty to one charge of criminal breach of trust under section 406 of the Penal Code, Cap 224.

## THE FACTS

2       Sometime between June 2015 and June 2017, the Accused and the victim’s son were in a romantic relationship. The Accused had moved in to stay with her beau at the victim’s flat at Blk 152, Woodlands Drive 14. During the same period, the victim had on occasions allowed her to borrow her jewelleries. In this regard, the victim had also entrusted her with the key to the jewellery box.

3       Sometime between October 2016 and January 2017, the Accused had taken the jewelleries and pawned them without the victim’s knowledge. The total value of the jewelleries misappropriated in this way was $16,250/-. Only three pieces of jewellery were recovered from the pawnshops namely, one gold anklet, one gold piece and one gold bracelet. The Accused had made full restitution of $16,250/- to the victim.

## SENTENCING SUBMISSION & MITIGATION PLEA

4       The Accused was a first offender.

5       DPP Nicholas Lim cited case precedents which showed that the sentence for items valued around $16,000/- was between 15 weeks’ and three months’ imprisonment. He asked for a three months’ imprisonment sentence.

6       The Accused, who was self-represented, informed that she had to borrow money to pay restitution. She also informed that her son would be sitting for his PSLE examination this year. She was the sole carer of her son, and her husband was currently overseas. She asked for a non-custodial sentence.

## THE SENTENCE

7       The case precedents for a s 406 Penal Code offence showed that 15 weeks’ to three months’ imprisonment have been imposed where the value of the item or items misappropriated ranged from $12,996/- to $16,546/-.

8       In _PP v Osi Maria Elenora Protacio_ , the accused was a receptionist in a dental clinic. She misappropriated payments from patients and used them to settle her debts. The amount involved was $14,089.05. Full restitution was made. The District Judge fined her $4,000/- but on appeal the sentence was enhanced to 15 weeks’ imprisonment.

9       In _PP v Lim Yew Heng_ , the accused was the dormitory manager of a construction company. He pockets three cheques totalling $12,332/- from customers. Full restitution was made. The sentence imposed was three months’ imprisonment.

10     In _Tham Whye Tong v PP_ , the accused was a general manager of a company. He misappropriated a sum totalling $13,547.57. Full restitution was made. He was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment.

11     In _PP v Nurita Binte Salem_ (DAC 917187/16), the accused was the principal of a pre-school. She misappropriated a total of $12,996/- from the school. She made full restitution. She was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment.

12     In _PP v Halijah Binte Jamaludin_ (DAC 916583/16), the accused was a customer service officer who misappropriated cash payments made by customers totalling $16,546.50. She made full restitution. She was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment.

13     In all these cases, the accused persons were either first offenders or had no similar or related antecedent. In all these cases, full restitution was also made.

14     I see no reason why I should not be guided by these case precedents. Granted, they all involved employer-employee relationships. The accused persons in these cases were placed in positions of trust by virtue of the post or designation that they held in their organisations or companies.

15     The present case was not an employer-employee relationship. However, I did not think that the degree of abuse of trust was any different. The facts showed that the victim had placed a high degree of trust in the Accused. She had not just allowed the Accused to use her jewelleries on occasions, but also had entrusted the key to the jewellery box to the Accused.

16     For these reasons, I imposed a sentence of three months’ imprisonment.

17     The Accused has appealed against the sentence. She is currently on bail pending appeal.
