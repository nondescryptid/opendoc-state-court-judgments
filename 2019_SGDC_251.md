\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9260/2019/01.\]

26 November 2019

### District Judge Ng Peng Hong:

1       The Accused claimed trial to a single charge of drug trafficking in a Class A controlled drug by having in his possession 10.14 grams of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking without authorisation, an offence under s5(1)(a) read with s5(2) and punishable under s33(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act.

2       From the court record, the Accused had a legal counsel. However, at trial, the Accused appeared in person. He is appealing against his conviction and sentence.

3       After the conclusion of the trial, both parties submitted their respective written submissions. Having considered the submissions and the evidence, I found that the Prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt the charge against the Accused. Accordingly, I found him guilty and convicted him on the charge.

4       I sentenced the Accused to 20 years’ imprisonment. He is currently serving his sentence.

## Case for Defence

5       The defence was one of denial. He claimed that he did not order the bundles containing diamorphine that were delivered to him. He alleged that the prosecution witness Lee Kwor Liang (also known as ‘Ah Liang’ or ‘Liang’) put the bundles into his vehicle. He did not know the contents of the bundles. He claimed that it was a case of wrong delivery as he only asked for 50gm of ‘leng eh’ which he said was “Ice”. ‘Ice’ is a well-known street name for Methamphetamine. He asserted that the drugs (‘leng eh’) that he ordered was for his own consumption. He also challenged the admissibility of the various police statements (including P9, P29 and P30) made by him. He alleged that he was induced into making the statements because his wife was threatened or that he gave the statements after the IO promised to allow him to make a phone call to his wife after the statement recording. He also alleged that the statements made by him contained inaccuracies. Indirectly, the Accused questioned the integrity of the officers from the Central Narcotic Bureau (‘CNB’) who had recorded his statements.

## Undisputed Facts

6       The Accused was an odd job worker.

7       Exhibit P5 is a set of photographs taken on 11 April 2017. P5 showed the photographs of the motor cycle JPS 6104 ridden by Lee Kwor Liang and the motor car SGZ2090G which was driven by the Accused.

8       P5 also has the photographs of the exhibits seized. Of particular relevance were photographs 14, 15 and 16, which depicted the two bundles retrieved from the said motor car.

9       It was not disputed that on 11 April 2017, Lee Kwor Liang (‘Liang’), the rider of said motor cycle JPS 6104 boarded the car SGZ2090G driven by the Accused. Soon after Liang has alighted from the car, the Accused drove to block 9, Teck Whye Lane. After the Accused alighted from his car, he was arrested when walking towards the void deck. A search was conducted on the car and the two black bundles shown in P5, photograph 14, were found. The two bundles were sent to HSA for analysis.

10     The two bundles marked as “A1A1” and A2A1” were found to contain 898.6 grams of granular/powdery substance and was pulverised and homogenised into powdery substance. The powdery substance was analysed and found to contain not less than 10.14 grams of diamorphine. See exhibits P2 and P3.

11     After the arrest, the Accused was brought to his flat at #XXX, Block 9, Teck Whye Lane (‘the unit’) where a search was conducted. Nothing incriminating was found in the unit.

12     There was no denial that Liang had made about 10 deliveries of drugs to the Accused before he was arrested.

13     Three mobile phones were seized from the Accused and identified as GAK-HP1, GAK-HP2 and GAK-HP3 (P24, P25 and P26). See also photograph 27 of P5. The Accused confirmed he was the only one who used these three phones.

## Case for the Prosecution

14     The Prosecution called 16 witnesses. I will summarise the evidence of the key witnesses.

15     The Accused put up a struggle when he was arrested. A search was conducted on the car driven by the Accused and two black bundles were recovered under the driver’ seat. After the arrest, the Accused was brought up to his unit. Upon entering the unit, a search was conducted. The Accused’s wife was in the unit. She was arrested and brought to CNB Office, Woodlands Check Point for urine testing.

16     During the search in the unit, there was a phone call made to the Accused’s mobile phone. The conversation between the caller and the Accused was on speaker mode. Inspector Tay Cher Yeen (PW 5) recorded the phone conversation in his field diary at 0234 hours on 11 April 2017. See exhibit P8. The circumstances surrounding the recording of P8 will be elaborated below. Soon after P8 was recorded, SSGT Au Yong Hong Mian (PW6) recorded a contemporaneous statement from the Accused at 2.46am. See exhibit P9.

## Mobile phones

17     The Prosecution seized various mobile phones and SIM cards from the accused person. It also tendered the records of the messages found on the various mobile phones capturing the records from 1 March 2017 to 11 April 2017. See exhibits P11, P12 and P13. Exhibit P14 was in respect of the ZTE mobile phone owned by Liang. Where relevant, I will refer to them.

## Statements from Co-Accused Lee Kwor Liang (PW13)

18     Liang gave two statements dated 13 April 2017 and 14 April 2017 respectively. These statements were admitted pursuant to s147 (3) Evidence Act and marked as exhibits P22 and P23 respectively. Liang admitted these were his statements and that they were true. I had no doubt as to their reliability given the fact that the statements were given soon after the arrest of the Accused and PW13. Moreover, there was no good reason or motive for PW13 to lie. It were also consistent with other objective evidence.

19     Exhibit P22 at \[14\] stated, “after meeting Ah Poh, he handed me a modified helmet and told me inside got two bundles. Ah Poh told me the two bundles contain ‘Re Shui’ and told me to deliver to ‘C’.

20     At \[36\] of P23, Liang admitted that “ over the past 6 months I have made at least 10 deliveries of ‘Re Shui’ to C. C only buy ‘Re Shui’ and nothing else. In the past deliveries, I will deliver either one or two bundles of ‘Re Shui’ to C.”

## Statements from the Accused

21     The Accused challenged the admissibility of his statements and its accuracy. The Accused gave a cautioned statement dated 11 April 2017 (exhibit P28), two long statements dated 16 April 2017 and 18 April 2017 respectively (Exhibits P29 and P30). Station Inspector Quah Yong Sen (PW15) recorded these three statements.

22     The Accused also gave a contemporaneous statement dated 11 April 2017, to SSGT Au Yong Hong Mian (PW6). See exhibit P9.

23     I ruled that the statements (P9, P29 and P30) were made voluntarily and were interpreted to him. Other than the obvious clerical mistake as to the date in P29 \[9\], they reflected what the Accused said to the respective CNB officers.

24     In exhibit P9, the Accused admitted that Liang came into his car and placed the ‘leng eh’ in between his legs. In P9, the Accused also admitted that he would pass the ‘leng eh’ as instructed by the Malaysian side. He had done this for about 10 times.

25     In P29 \[6\], the Accused stated that Lee Kwor Liang (‘Liang”) was the deliveryman assigned by the Malaysian supplier to deliver drugs to him. On that day, the Accused met Liang to collect the drugs.

26     At P29 \[8\], the Accused informed Station Inspector Quah Yong Sen that ‘Leng Eh’ is also known as ‘Ice’. In P29 \[9\], the Accused also alleged that he ordered over the phone for 25 gm of ‘Leng Eh’ and 25 gm of ‘Sio Kway’ also known as Ketamine. He said these were for his own consumption.

27     At P29 \[10\] the Accused said “I stopped my car for Ah Liang to board. Ah Liang boarded and sat at the front passenger seat. As soon as Ah Liang sat down, I tried to make a U-turn to face the car towards the car park entrance. At this moment, I think Ah Liang placed something on the gear lever.” At P29 \[11\], the Accused added that as he was making a left turn out of the car park, something dropped onto the floor mat and he used his left hand to sweep the things which felt like two square blocks, underneath his seat.

28     In P30, at the last page, the Accused drew two squares in response to \[24\] of P30 where the Accused mentioned about the drugs wrapped into bundles in different sizes.

## Evidence of Jason Tay Cher Yeen (PW5)

29     PW5 was a Station Inspector with CNB for 19 years. He was involved in the arrest of the Accused, the recording of a telephone conversation between the Accused and a Malaysian caller, taking of statements and the handling of exhibits for photograph taking. The items seized from the Accused were documented in exhibit P7. He also saw SGT Yogaraj s/o Ragunathan Pillay (PW4) recovered two black bundles from under the driver’s seat of the Accused’s car.

30     PW5 was also present in the Accused’s flat and was aware that SSGT Au Yong Hong Mian (“SSGT Au Yong”) was going to take statement from the Accused. While in the flat, PW5 asked the Accused about the Malaysian boss and who were the intended recipients of the two black bundles. The Accused told him that he needed to wait for the phone call from the Malaysian boss who will tell him where and who to deliver the bundles to. Then the phone call came through to the Accused’s white IPhone. The phone call was from a Malaysian caller. PW5 recorded the telephone conversation in his own handwriting and had it typed out. PW5 confirmed in court that the transcript was correct and admitted as exhibit P8 collectively. I rejected the Accused’s allegation that P8 was fabricated by PW5. There was no reason for him to do so. The contents of P8 were also corroborated by PW6.

31     The recording of the phone conversation with the Malaysian caller was in the presence of the Accused and SSGT Au Yong. In the transcript, P8, ‘B1’ denoted the Accused. There were two calls made to the Accused by the contact “8899”. The first call was recorded at 0234 hours and the second call was recorded at 0238 hours. “8899” was the contact saved in the Accused’s mobile phone and it referred to a Malaysian telephone number +XXX. “Jetty” in P8 denoted PW5. It was a call sign used by him. “XXX” in P8 was the PIN to the Accused’s mobile phone.

32     The conversation between the Accused and the caller was in Mandarin. The phone conversation was in speaker mode. PW5 translated and recorded it in English. See exhibit P8. After the call, PW5 read the recording in Mandarin to the Accused and he acknowledged and signed. The Accused also confirmed the recording was correct and he signed on it.

33     PW5 testified that during the conversation the caller seemed puzzled as the Accused repeatedly asked the caller whom he was supposed to pass the two things. The Accused claimed that he had ordered “50 water” but “Ah Liang give me wrongly”. Given the nature of the operation carried out by the CNB officers that day, it was clear to PW5 that the two things referred to the two black bundles retrieved from the Accused’s car.

34     PW5 testified that “one” referred to in P8 was not the numerical meaning of one but the Singlish slang. “Ah Liang” was Lee Kwor Liang and was arrested as reflected in the arrest report.

35     PW5 commented that from the phone conversation, it also appeared that the Accused hinted to the caller that he has been arrested. This was because the caller asked, “your side got problem is it?” The Accused replied “Ah” in a very fast manner and said “the two you want me to pass to who?” The caller then hung up. “Two” mentioned here was the numerical number.

36     After the call ended, SSGT Au Yong proceeded to record the contemporaneous statement from the Accused. PW5 was unable to hear exactly what transpired during the statement recording by SSGT Au Yong.

37     During the cross-examination, PW5 disagreed that the caller was asking for Ah Liang. PW5 also mentioned that the Accused did not mention “leng eh” during his phone conversation. PW5 confirmed that his transcript was true. He also disagreed that an officer had said to the Accused that if he did not admit something would happen to his wife.

38     PW5 also explained, “leng eh” meant “Ice” or methamphetamine.

## Evidence of SSGT Au Yong Hong Mian (PW6) (SSGT Au Yong)

39     SSGT Au Yong was with the CNB. He confirmed that on 11 April 2017, the CNB officers were at the vicinity of Teck Whye to conduct an operation to arrest drug traffickers. He corroborated PW5’s evidence.

40     SSGT Au Yong confirmed that the Accused struggled when arrested.

41     The Accused was handcuffed and brought to his car. PW4 did the search of the car and found two bundles under the driver’s seat. The Accused was then brought up to his flat.

42     In the Accused’s flat, PW6 served the mandatory death penalty notice on the Accused in the presence of PW5. Then the Accused’s phone rang. PW5 asked the Accused to answer. The call was placed on speaker mode. SSGT Au Yong confirmed that the phone conversation was consistent with P8 as recorded by PW5. He also confirmed that the caller appeared to be puzzled during his conversation with the Accused. PW6 also did not recall the Accused saying “50 Leng eh” in Hokkien. The Accused spoke in a mixture of Hokkien and Mandarin with the caller. PW6 also testified that when the phone call came in the screen showed the contact name “8899”. PW6 also confirmed “water” recorded in P8 whether spoken in Hokkien or Mandarin did not refer to any drug slang.

43     After the phone conversation, PW6 proceeded to record a contemporaneous statement (P9) from the Accused in the living room of the unit. The statement was recorded in Hokkien as the Accused was comfortable speaking in Hokkien. It was read to the Accused and signed by the Accused. The Accused confirmed P9 was true and correct.

## Ancillary Hearing for the Admissibility of P9

44     The Accused objected to the admissibility of the statement (P9) on the ground that he was told that if he did not admit something would happen to his wife. Hence, an ancillary hearing was conducted. I found that the statement was made voluntarily by the Accused without any threat, inducement or promise. The statement was admitted and marked as P9. The statement was taken on 11 April 2017 at 0246 hours in the living room of the Accused’s unit and recorded in PW6’s pocket book. I found that PW6 had not met the Accused before. I had no doubt that the answers given by the Accused were recorded by PW6. PW6 confirmed that no officer had said to the Accused that if he did not admit, something would happen to his wife later. PW6 also testified that other than PW5 and himself there was no other officer present in the living room during the recording of P9. PW6 was the only officer that posed the questions to the Accused in the recording of P9. The allegations against Tony Ng Tze Chian, a Senior Inspector with CNB were unfounded. I found there was no reason for PW6 to threaten the Accused or to frame him.

45     The Prosecution also called Tony Ng Tze Chian, a Senior Inspector with CNB (“SI Tony”) to give evidence during the ancillary hearing. He too never met the Accused before. He confirmed that he was not involved in the recording of P9. Neither was he nearby during the recording of P9. He was walking around the house. There was no reason for him to be present during the recording. He also said he did not make any threat, inducement or promise to the Accused or his wife. He testified that he did not threaten the Accused that his wife would be arrested if he did not co-operate. SI Tony also did not pose any question to the Accused. He confirmed that he was not the recorder of the statement and had no reason to threaten the Accused that something will happen to his wife. There was no reason for SI Tony to frame the Accused. I accepted his evidence.

46     The Prosecution also recalled PW5 for the ancillary hearing. PW5 confirmed that during the recording of P9, SI Tony did not speak to the Accused and he was not nearby. He also confirmed that SI Tony did not threaten the Accused that he would arrest his wife if he did not co-operate.

47     The Accused’s evidence during the ancillary hearing was that SI Tony was present when PW6 was recording P9. The Accused also alleged that PW6 omitted to record his statement that he had ordered 50gm of “leng eh” for his own consumption and that SI Tony threatened him to admit otherwise something will happen to his wife. He alleged that SI Tony was the only one who had threatened him.

48     The Accused admitted that he signed P9 and had never met PW6 before. He also admitted that he did not know PW5 and conceded that PW6 had no reason to frame him.

49     The Accused also acknowledged that he had never met SI Tony before his arrest and did not know of any reason why SI Tony would threaten or frame him. He also agreed that by signing the statement, it meant he acknowledged it and agreed with it. I found that the allegations against Tony Ng Tze Chian, a Senior Inspector with CNB were unfounded.

50     I found that the evidence given by the prosecution witnesses for the ancillary hearing was consistent. I also agreed with the Prosecution that P9 was more of an exculpatory statement in that P9 stated that the Accused met Liang to take 50 which was understood to be 50 gm of “leng eh” meaning methamphetamine whereas the charge against him was trafficking a larger quantity of diamorphine. Hence, there was no reason for any threat inducement or promise made to the Accused.

51     In the circumstances, I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that P9 was made by the Accused voluntarily and his statement was recorded accurately.

52     PW6 explained in details about P9. Among other things, PW 6 elaborated that Q12 in P9 was posed to the Accused based on the earlier phone conversation the Accused had with the Malaysian caller (See P8). That was why PW6 asked Accused whom did he intend to pass the drugs to. The two black bundles were shown to the Accused during the recording of P9. See Q7 and A7 of P9. In A13 of P9, the Accused mentioned that he did this for about 10 times for the Malaysian. In P9, A14, the Accused answered that the last delivery he did was on 10 April 2017 at about 1pm in Choa Chu Kang area. In P9, A15, the Accused said he delivered the drugs for free.

## Dr Stephen Phang (PW7)

53     PW7 was the author of the IMH report dated 10 May 2017. See exhibit P10.

54     PW7 did the psychiatric assessment of the Accused over three interviews conducted primarily in Mandarin and occasionally in English. PW7 confirmed that the Accused understood him without any requirement of an interpreter.

55     With reference to P10, PW7 confirmed that the words or sentences in italic were verbatim quotations from the Accused. At \[11\] of P10, the Accused used the words “gear elevator”.

56     During cross-examination, PW7 also confirmed that the Accused did mention there were 2-3 instances when wrong delivery were made by the boss to him. See \[10\] of P10. The Accused also told PW7 that he had ordered 50gm of “leng eh”.

57     PW7 also confirmed that the Accused did mention, “feel that it was two bundles, square- shaped” as stated in \[12\] of P10.

58     PW7 clarified that the Accused’s accounts in P10 from \[8\] to \[14\] were self-reported accounts by the Accused.

## Tay Tat Hwa (PW9)

59     PW9 was a forensic examiner from KordaMentha. He has many years of experience in computer and mobile phone forensic investigations.

60     PW9 prepared a mobile phone forensic examination report of the exhibit GAK-HP3. See exhibit P11.

## Lee Catherine Susan (PW10)

61     PW10 specialised in forensic technology for about 13 years. She prepared the mobile phone forensic examination report for exhibit GAK-HP1 – a mobile phone that was shown in photograph 27 in P5. See exhibit P12.

62     P12 contained details of the said phone contacts, the call records and SMS messages from 1 March 2017 to 11 April 2017.

63     Annex D of P12 at pages 11 and 12 showed the deleted SMS messages recovered from the mobile phone. It also showed the exact timestamp of the mobile phone. It also indicated the Accused “Kiat Gan” was the name of the one of the users’ accounts of this particular phone.

64     PW10 also prepared a mobile phone examination report for exhibit GAK-HP2 –a mobile phone pictured at photograph 27 in P5. See exhibit P13.

65     P13 contained details of the said phone and WhatsApp contacts, the call records and SMS messages including MMS and WhatsApp messages from 1 March 2017 to 11 April 2017. It also included those that were deleted.

## Pang Ching Yen (PW11)

66     In May 2017, PW11 was a forensic specialist attached to the CNB. PW11 conducted a forensic examination on one ZTE mobile phone containing two SIM cards marked as “LKL-HP. See exhibit P14.

67     P14 provided the details of phone contacts, phone calls, WhatsApp call, WhatsApp incoming video call, SMS messages and WhatsApp chat messages from 1 March 2017 to 11 April 2017.

## Wong Png Leong (PW12)

68     PW12 was a Language Executive attached to the CNB. He specialised in Mandarin and Hokkien.

69     PW12 prepared the document, exhibit P15, which contained the English translation of the Chinese SMS messages appearing at P12, Annex D, pages 11 and 12 of 14 ( the deleted SMS messages from mobile phone GAK-HP 1).

70     PW12 also translated into English the Chinese SMS messages at P13, Annex D, page 5 of 7. The English translation was marked as exhibit P16.

71     Exhibit P17 was the English translation done by PW12 for the exhibit P14 in respect of the Chinese messages. In P17, serial number 1, the message translated was C-84676977 = 3400 from the Chinese SMS message at page 30 of 217 at P14 – the incoming message from sender +XXX to the ZTE phone of Lee Kwor Liang.

72     PW12 was also familiar with the various Mandarin slangs for heroin and Methamphetamine. He testified that “shao de”, ‘re shui’ and ‘bai fen’ were all street names for diamorphine. Methamphetamine can be referred to as ‘leng de’, ‘leng shui’ or ‘Ice’. It will be known as ‘leng eh’ in Hokkien. See page 57 Day 3 NE.

73     PW12 was referred to serial number 704, at page 25 of 30 in P17 where PW12 used the word “hot”. It reads “_Liang reply after you wake up, we are still friends even if we are not working, I just do not dare to promise the customers, I ask you now (which could read as “I am asking you first”), C placed an order for goods today hot I will promise C if you want to do else I do not dare to promise him_”. It was a WhatsApp chat message from number XXX to Lee Kwor Liang. PW12 confirmed that “hot” would be a slang related to heroin. He also testified that he translated the word “hot” from the Mandarin word “Re”. On the other hand, Methamphetamine might relate to the slang “cold”.

74     PW12 also prepared a transcript and translation of audio files in Lee Kwor Liang’s mobile phone. See exhibit P18.

75     P19 is a translation of selected SMS messages between Lee Kwor Liang and number +XXX.

## Lee Kwor Liang (PW13)

76     PW13 was arrested on 11 April 2017. He has since been convicted for drug trafficking and was sentenced to 17 years’ imprisonment. At the material time, PW13 was arrested soon after he had passed to the Accused two black bundles of drugs. His arrest report was exhibited as P6. Exhibit P6 stated that S$3400 were recovered from PW13.

77     PW 13 was helping Teo Ah Poh, a Malaysian to deliver illegal drugs to Singapore. Among the drugs delivered included Erimin 5 and Ice also known in Mandarin or dialect as “leng shui” meaning cold water. He also knew of the item “hot water” or “re shui” which he came to know about it when the CNB officer opened the packaging. He admitted that “re shui” referred to heroin.

78     PW13 owned the ZTE mobile phone marked as LKL-HP shown in photo number 21 of exhibit P5.

79     Exhibit P21 was a compilation of what were in P14 as well as the English translation done by the CNB translator.

80     PW13 confirmed the number +XXX as belonging to Teo Ah Poh. He also confirmed that Teo Ah Poh addressed him as “Liang”.

81     PW13 was referred to at page 21 of 22 of P21. He confirmed that on 10 April 2017, Teo Ah Poh was preparing to deliver two packages to C and asked PW13 to collect 3,400 from C. C was identified as the Accused present in court.

82     PW13 testified that on 10 April 2017, sometime past midnight, he rode the motorcycle to Singapore with a helmet provided by Teo Ah Poh. He rode to a convenience store 7-Eleven at Teck Whye where he took out the two bundles hidden in his helmet. When the Accused arrived in his car, PW13 boarded the car. PW13 placed the two bundles near the gearbox and was asked to take the money at the handbrake. After taking the money, PW13 alighted from the car. Thereafter, PW13 was arrested.

83     PW13 confirmed that on the material day he only had the items for the Accused. This was corroborated by the message sent by Teo Ah Poh to him as seen at s/n 169 to 171 of P21.

84     Initially PW13 claimed that he did not know what was given by Teo Ah Poh to him for delivery to the Accused. But he admitted that Teo Ah Poh had told him before, during the 6-month period when he made deliveries to the Accused over 10 occasions, the items were “hot water”. PW13 admitted that “re shui” was heroin or in Chinese “white powder”. PW13 also testified that he did not see it.

85     PW13 insisted that he was not certain what was delivered to C. Hence, the Prosecution applied and given leave to cross-examine PW13 on his previous statements dated 13 April 2017 and 14 April 2017, which were inconsistent with his testimony in court. These statements were admitted and marked as P22 and P23 respectively. PW13 agreed with the learned DPP that these statements were true and interpreted to him. The material portions of his statements have been set out above under the rubric “Statements from Co-Accused Lee Kwor Liang (PW13).

86     During his cross-examination, PW13 affirmed that before his arrest, Teo Ah Poh told him that the bundles were ‘re shui’ and after his arrest; he saw the contents when CNB officers unwrapped the bundles. After the arrest, he saw it was ‘Bai Fen’ when CNB officer opened it. He also confirmed that he guessed that ‘re shui’ was ‘bai fen’. See Day 4 NE at page 26, lines 13 – 28.

87     PW13 also agreed that his boss had told him to deliver ‘re shui’ to the Accused. He explained that his boss gave him no choice and “will press me down and not let me do my.things that I want to do freely”. See Day 4 NE at page 30, lines 16-27.

## SSGT Ibrahim Bin Juasa (PW14)

88     PW14 was attached to the CNB. He testified that the gross weight of diamorphine seized was about 900gm. Based on his experience; he said that the street price for these would be $5700 to 7,000 based on the inland arrest in Singapore. However, the price would be lower if it were from Malaysia. On the other hand, the street price for 50 gm of ice or Methamphetamine during the period of 11 April 2017 would be about $1700 to $1800. However, if ordered from Malaysia the price will be lower.

## Quah Yong Sen (PW15)

89     Quah Yong Sen was an Inspector attached to CNB (“Inspector Quah”). He was the investigation officer for this case involving the Accused and Lee Kwor Liang. He recorded the caution statement from the Accused. The Accused agreed that there was no threat, inducement or promise. It was admitted and marked as P28.

90     PW15 also recorded two long statement from the Accused on 16 April 2017 and 18 April 2017 respectively. Accused challenged its admissibility on the basis that he had requested the IO to allow him to call his wife but was told that he will be allowed to call after the recording of the statement. An ancillary hearing was accordingly held.

91     The main trial resumed after the ancillary hearing and the admission of P29 and P30 into evidence. The Accused also challenged the accuracy of his statements that were likely to implicate to him.

92     Inspector Quah disagreed that before the recording of P29 and P30 he told the Accused just to answer the questions asked and there was no need to answer those that were not asked.

93     In respect of the last sentence in P30 \[26\], Inspector Quah disagreed that it was incorrect. He disagreed that the Accused had told him instead that he “will return back to the runner sent by Lao Ban, and then collect the drugs that I had ordered from the runner.”

## Long statements from the Accused (P29 and P30)

94     The material portions of P29 and P30 have been detailed above.

95     Inspector Quah (PW15) confirmed that both P29 and P30 were interpreted and read back to the Accused. Both the statements were provided by the Accused.

96     Inspector Quah also confirmed that when the cautioned statement P28 was read to the Accused, he did not raise any complaints.

97     Inspector Quah testified that “8899” was from a Malaysian and the number was saved in both the Accused’s hand phone and Ah Liang’s hand phone. 8899 was the Malaysian based supplier who supplied the drugs.

98     During the cross-examination, the Accused questioned PW15 intensely on the accuracy of P29 and P30. PW15 explained that although the Accused spoke directly to him in Mandarin, the presence of the interpreter PW16 was to ensure there was no miscommunication and to assist in clarifying some words and the sentence structure. PW15 also admitted that there was a typographical error at \[9\] of P29 regarding the date, it should read 10 April 2017. He also confirmed that the Accused did request to make a phone call.

99     Regarding P29 \[9\], PW15 confirmed that the Accused did not mention that he wanted 50gm of ‘Leng Eh’. Neither did he mention the amount was $2,000 and not $2400 as stated at P29 \[9\].

100    PW15 confirmed that P29 \[13\] was accurately recorded without any omission of what the Accused said. PW15 reiterated that at the end of the recording of P29, it was read back to the Accused before the Accused signed on it. PW15 also testified that if the Accused disagreed with the interpretation, he can disagree with the interpreter and PW15 would seek clarification.

101    The Accused in the main trial again questioned about the accuracy of P30 recorded on 18 April 2017. He claimed that he never said, “share the drugs with my friends” at P30 \[22\] which PW15 disagreed. PW15 also disagreed that at \[22\] of P30 where the Accused said his order was around 50 gm of ‘Ice’ and 50 gm of ‘K’ was inaccurate. PW15 disagreed that the correct version should be “order will be around 50 gm of ‘Leng Eh’ or 50 gm of K.” The Accused also challenged the accuracy of P30 \[24\] where it was stated that the two bundles were found underneath the seat of the car. PW15 disagreed that it should read as “inside my rental car”.

102    In respect of P30 \[25\] the Accused also claimed to have said to PW15 a different version. He was very detailed in stating what should be the correct version which can be found in Day 5 NE page 43 Line 2 – page 44 Line 4 (reproduced below) which PW15 disagreed.

> QOkay. Alright, I will proceed to read paragraph 25 to you. “Whenever I received the bundle from Ah Liang, I will not open it to check the contents. I don’t open the bundle because I will wait for Lao Ban to call me back for a confirmation. What I meant is that after I handed the remaining payment to Ah Liang, Lao Ban will call me again to confirm the amount tallies to drug that I had ordered. Most of the time, the bundle that I received will contain drugs which are not my order. In such case, Lao Ban will get somebody to approach me to collect the bundle. Those people will meet me at public places but I don’t remember where. When they arrived at those locations, they will approach me to take the bundle away. A short while later, the person will come back and pass me the drugs that I ordered. I don’t get paid for doing this as I’m not working for Lao Ban. I’m only doing Lao Ban a favour and I’m not expecting any rewards in return. I assume these people are the actual buyers but I cannot be sure. I’ve seen at least 3 different people, I don’t know who this people are and I don’t have their contact numbers. I’m unable to describe these people because I don’t remember how they look like.” Alright, so what I told you is actually slightly different. “Most of the time, the bundle that I received will contain drugs which are not my order. But a few times the drugs was wrongly delivered to me, in such cases, Lao Ban will get his runner to approach me to collect back the bundle. When the runner reached the location at my carpark, I open the car door and pointed the thing to the runner and they collect it themselves. After that, I collect the actual order from the runner. I am not working for Lao Ban, I only buy the drug for my consumption. I have seen at least 3 different people, I don’t know who this people are and I don’t have their contact numbers. I’m unable to describe this people because I don’t remember how they look like.” This is what I told you instead.

103    The Accused also claimed that P30 \[26\] was not accurate in that it should be “I swept away this in the car” and not “underneath the car seat”. PW15 disagreed,

104    In P30 \[27\], the Accused also alleged that it was not accurate in that it should read “enjoy drugs with friends” and not “share my drugs with them for free”. PW15 disagreed.

105    PW15 also disagreed with the Accused’s allegation that P30 was signed after he had made the phone call.

106    During the ancillary hearing, PW15 testified that there was no threat inducement or promise. During the recording of the statement, the Chinese interpreter Ee Soon Huat (PW16) was present.

107    PW15 confirmed that on 11 April 2017, the Accused’s wife was arrested at the Accused’s unit and brought to station for urine testing. At the time when PW15 commenced the statement recording on 16 April 2017 at 1:51pm (P29), the Accused’s wife has been released. Her release has been communicated to the Accused when P28 was recorded on 11 April 2017. PW15 also confirmed that the Accused did ask to make a phone call to his wife when the statement was being recorded. PW15 explained that he did not want the process of interview to be interrupted and hence offered him the opportunity to call his wife after the recording of the statement. The Accused did subsequently make the phone call.

108    PW15 also recorded a further statement from the Accused on 18 April 2017 without any threat inducement or promise (P30). But the Accused also similarly objected to its admissibility on the ground that PW15 promised him that he would be allowed to make a phone call after the recording of the statement. PW15 did not deny there was such a request and offered the same explanation as what happened for the statement recorded on 16 April 2017 (P29). The Accused was allowed to make the call after the statement recording.

109    PW15 testified that there was no threat inducement or promise made to the Accused for the recording of the 18 April statement. This statement was also recorded in the presence of Ee Soon Huat, the interpreter.

110    The statements recorded on 16 April and 18 April respectively were read and interpreted in Mandarin by Ee Soon Huat.

111    PW15 disagreed that the statement was printed for signature after the Accused had made the phone call. PW15 also disagreed that the statement (P29) was not interpreted back to him. He confirmed the contents of P29 came from the Accused.

112    PW15 also clarified that for both statements (P29 and P30) he did not insist that the Accused must give a particular account in return for the opportunity to make a phone call. The Accused also did not raise any concern about his wife during the recording of P29 and P30.

## Ee Soon Huat (PW16) (ancillary hearing)

113    PW16 specialised in Mandarin and dialects including Hokkien. He has been an interpreter for about 30 years. He was the interpreter for the recording of P29 and P30. He has read to the Accused both the statements after the recording. He also confirmed that there was no threat, inducement or promise given to the Accused. The statements were given voluntarily and that there were no complaints by the Accused during the recording. The Accused affirmed it to be true by signing on every page of the statements.

114    PW16 also said that he was unable to recall whether the Accused did ask PW15 for permission to call his wife before the recording. Neither was PW16 able to recall that the IO promised the Accused that he can make call after the recording.

## Ancillary Hearing for the Admissibility of P29 and P30 (Evidence of Gan Ann Kiat)

115    During the ancillary hearing for the admissibility of P29 and P30, the Accused Gan Ann Kiat gave evidence. When interviewed by the IO, he wanted to call his wife to know her status as she was also arrested that day. He alleged that the IO wanted him to provide statement first and promised that if he gave the statement he will be allowed to call his wife after that.

116    When he was arrested and was at his home, the Accused alleged that the officer told him to co-operate and admit otherwise something might happen to his wife. Hence, he signed out of fear. He was also concerned that something might happen to his wife.

117    During his cross-examination, the Accused admitted that during the recording of P29 and P30, PW16 was present on both occasions with PW15. He also admitted that he signed both these statements. He also agreed that by signing the documents it signified his agreement. But he claimed that he signed out of fear.

118    I found the Accused to be an inconsistent and untruthful when testifying during the ancillary hearing.

119    When questioned by the learned DPP whether the Accused knew his wife has been released because he requested to make a phone call to her, the Accused insisted that it was after the recording of the statement not before. When questioned further, the Accused clarified that he wanted to find out whether or not she was indeed being released. See Day 5 NE at page 11, lines 16-29. This clearly showed that the Accused was tailoring his evidence and was not a truthful witness. The Accused must have known of his wife’s release otherwise he would not have requested to make a phone call to her. When the same question was asked in relation to P30 that he knew his wife has been released, the Accused agreed but added that he was asked to co-operate otherwise his wife might be sent back. See Day 5 NE at page 12 lines 4-10. The Accused admitted that PW15 and PW16 did not make any threat inducement or promise in relation to the wellbeing of the Accused’s wife. The Accused insisted that if he were not promised the phone call to his wife, he would not have given the statement. But he agreed that PW15 did not demand that he was to provide a specific account for P29 and P30. He agreed that the proposal by PW15 to make call after the statement recording was reasonable.

120    When the learned DPP pointed out to the Accused that he did not object to the admissibility of P28 which was recorded by PW15 and interpreted by PW16, the Accused then alluded to the allegation that he had not slept for two nights and he just gave the statement so that he could sleep. He also mentioned that he was worried over his wife. He then said he now wanted to challenge its admissibility. Clearly, the Accused was trying to wriggle his way out when cornered.

## Ruling on the Admissibility of P29 and P30

121    Having heard the evidence and the submissions, I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that both the statements were made voluntarily and admitted it as P29 and P30. I found that the allegations by the Accused that he gave the statements out of fear for the well-being of his wife was unfounded and untrue. I agreed with the Prosecution that the arrest of the Accused’s wife was because she was a suspect. She was arrested for urine testing. The Accused was not asked to give a particular account in his statement in exchange for a phone call to his wife. In any event, by the time the statement was recorded the Accused had been informed that his wife had been released. He was informed of his wife's release when his cautioned statement was recorded on 11 April 2017. I agreed with the Prosecution that if there were any fear, it was self-perceived which would not be considered as inducement. See _PP v Lu Lai Heng_ \[1994\] 1 SLR (R) 1037 at \[19\].

122    To allow the Accused to make a phone call to his wife after the recording of the statement was reasonable as PW15 stated clearly that he did not want the phone call to disrupt the statement recording process. The Accused also conceded that this was a reasonable arrangement. There was no reason for me to doubt the evidence of PW15 and PW16 given for the ancillary hearing. I also did not think that PW15 would infringe the law in the presence of the interpreter. Accordingly, P29 and P30 were admitted into evidence.

## Evidence of Ee Soon Huat (PW16) for the main trial

123    PW16 was the Hokkien interpreter when the cautioned statement P28 was recorded from the Accused on 11 April 2017 at 1908 hours. He was also the interpreter when P29 was recorded from the Accused. It was interpreted in Mandarin to the Accused. He also confirmed the Accused understood what was interpreted to him and did not raise any objection to the content of the statement.

124    PW16 also interpreted the statement P30 in Mandarin to the Accused. He observed that the Accused understood what was interpreted to him. There was no objection raised by the Accused with regard to the contents of the statement and he signed the statement.

125    During the cross-examination, PW16 confirmed that he interpreted to the Accused P29 and P30. He disagreed that the statement was given to the Accused to sign after the Accused had made the phone call.

## Defence

126    The Defence elected to give evidence. The Accused had no other witness.

127    A summary of the Defence has been stated above. In addition, the Accused stated that out of the 10 deliveries, 3 or 4 times, it was given to him wrongly. Consequently, the boss will call him to inform him of the wrong delivery and will send someone to collect it back from him.

128    On the day in question, the Accused claimed that Liang just came into his car and put the bundles on the car, took the money and left. Whilst driving, the bundles fell off and he swept them away. He continued driving to his car park where he alighted and was arrested. He claimed that he did not know what were inside the bundles.

129    The Accused was brought to his unit. He alleged that the officer wanted to arrest his wife despite his protest that she had nothing to do with the case. A search was conducted in the unit but nothing incriminating was found.

130    Whilst in the unit, a phone call came through his phone. The phone conversation was recorded as P8. Later a second call came, the Accused alleged that he told the boss that “I asked for 50 gm of ‘leng eh’, what did you give me?” Thereafter, SSGT Au Yong took a statement from him and recorded it on his pocket book. See P9. At Q7A7 of P9, the Accused said when asked he told the officer these were ‘leng eh’ which he supposed it were as he had not opened it up to check at that time. It was for his own consumption. He alleged that he was threatened to co-operate otherwise something might happen to his wife. He claimed that he was asked to admit and fearing that something might happen to his wife, the Accused alleged that he was forced into saying he was actually waiting for the boss to tell him where to send these next. See Day 6 NE at page 18 lines 14-20. He claimed that the statement was not read to him although he signed it.

131    After the Accused was charged in court, another statement was taken from him. He requested from the IO to be allowed to make a phone call to his wife. He alleged that the IO replied that after the recording of the statement he would be allowed to call his wife. He told the IO he would order a variety of drugs for his own consumption for about 10 occasions. But out of these, 3-4 times the boss sent him the wrong things. He would return it in exchange for the correct things that he ordered. The Accused alleged that after the statement was recorded he was allowed to make the call and after the call, he was asked to sign the statement. The statement was not read back to him. Similarly, for P30, he also made a request to the IO to make a phone call to his wife. After the statement, he was allowed to make the call and after the call, the statement was given to him for signature. It was not read back to him but he signed. He claimed that he did not know the contents of the statement.

## The applicable law

132    In _PP v Tan Swim Hong_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 246</span> the High Court stated as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="100%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">55 In <em>Muhammad Ridzuan bin Md Ali v Public Prosecutor and other matters</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 3 SLR 0721.xml')">[2014] 3 SLR 721</a> at [59], the court summarised the elements to be proved for a charge of trafficking under s 5(1)(<em>a</em>) read with s 5(2) of the MDA:</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(a) possession of a controlled drug (which may be proved or presumed pursuant to s 18(1) of the MDA);</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(b) knowledge of the nature of the drug (which may be proved or presumed pursuant to s 18(2) of the MDA); and</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(c) possession of the drug was for the purpose of trafficking which was not authorised.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">56 Where the Prosecution seeks to prove the fact of possession, it must prove that the accused was in possession of the receptacle and that he knew that it contained something, which may later be established to be the drugs in question (<em>Zainal bin Hamad v Public Prosecutor and another appeal</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22557-SSP.xml')">[2018] 2 SLR 1119</a> at [12]). The Prosecution need not prove that the accused specifically knew that he was in possession of drugs – that question is an inquiry that arises when considering the question of knowledge (at [12]–[13]). Once it is proved that the accused had physical control over or possession of the receptacle that contains the thing in question, the court is entitled to infer that he had knowledge of the existence of that thing. The accused then has to discharge the evidential burden by raising a reasonable doubt that this was not the case. The Prosecution may also rely on the presumption of possession under s 18(1) of the MDA, which an accused can rebut by showing that he did not actually know that the thing was in his possession, such as if it was slipped into his bag or planted without his knowledge: <em>Adili Chibuike Ejike v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/23477-SSP.xml')">[2019] 2 SLR 254</a> (“<em>Adili</em>”) at [34] and [71].</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">57 Under s 18(2) of the MDA, the accused is presumed to know the specific drug that he is proved or presumed to have had in his possession: <em>Obeng Comfort v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20295-SSP.xml')">[2017] 1 SLR 633</a> (“<em>Obeng Comfort</em>”) at [35]. He may rebut that presumption by proving on a balance of probabilities that he did not know the nature of the controlled drug, such as by proving that he genuinely believed that he was in possession of something innocuous such as washing powder when it was in fact heroin: <em>Nagaenthran a/l K Dharmalingam v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2011] 4 SLR 1156.xml')">[2011] 4 SLR 1156</a> at [23] and [27]. The accused should be able to say what he thought or believed he was carrying: <em>Obeng Comfort</em> at [39].</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

## Credibility of Accused

133    I found the Accused to be an evasive witness and not a witness of truth. Accordingly, I rejected his defence.

134    Firstly, the Accused was asked whether he gave Liang $3400. He was evasive in answering that he “left it there and he took it and left.” See Day 6 NE at page 32 lines 5-9. His evasiveness was also evident when he was asked :

>   
| 

Q

 | 

And your version is that Mr. Lee Kwor Liang placed the drugs on the --- where the gear stick of the car is?

 |
| 

A

 | 

So I do not know where he place it but I---he---when---he place it, he left the car and I drove off immediately. It was so dark I didn’t see. I think it should be around that area, but the exact location, I wouldn’t be able to tell. I didn’t see where he placed. The moment he alighted, I just drove off.

 |

  
  

> See page 32 Day 6 NE, lines 10-16.

135    When the learned DPP confronted the Accused with the text messages between Liang and Teo Ah Poh or 8899, which did not mention about Liang being instructed to give money to him, the Accused gave a long explanation but without answering the question asked by the Prosecution. See Day 6 NE page 41 lines29 to line10 at page 42.

136    The Accused was referred to P21 – the voice and text messages between Lee Kwor Liang (LKL) and his handler from Malaysia - XXX, XXX, XXX. In particular, the Accused was referred to P21 page 21 of 22 serial number171 – message to LKL from +XXX, which the Accused agreed was the same as 8899 - “Liang I got the things already two C’s”. In response, the Accused disagreed that the Malaysian supplier intended to send the two bundles to him. He explained at page 34, Day 6 transcript: “So I do not know who this person is. I don’t know what were the arrangements like but what are the two things in the first place, because I had already said earlier that I only ordered 50 grams of Leng eh. So this conversation is happening between the---the Malaysian side. As I said earlier, I do not know what are the arrangement is like.”

137    The Accused agreed that he did not know of any motive for Liang to frame him. Yet, he disagreed with the statement at \[36\] of P23 given by Liang that he had delivered ‘Re Shui’ to him in the past.

138    The Accused did not even want to acknowledge that a square has 4 corners. See page 72, Day 6 NE

139    Besides being evasive, the Accused was also inconsistent in his evidence. The Accused was referred to P15 containing messages that he owed money to others. Despite the fact that these multiple messages were sent within a few hours asking for money yet the Accused disagreed he was indebted and explained that these messages were merely a front to induce 8899 to pay up for the losses in horse betting. The Accused confirmed that he was expecting money from 8899. In my view, this was inconsistent with his own evidence that on the material day he paid $2000 to Liang. I also found that the Accused’s allegation lacked clarity in that he cannot even give the precise amount that he was owed. Moreover, the Accused was unable to tell the sum of money he was expecting from 8899 (whom he also addressed as ‘boss’). The Accused also did not mention anything about horse betting in any of his statements.

140    The allegation of paying $2000 to Liang was not only inconsistent with the sum of $3400 recovered from Liang but also contradicted the message sent by the Teo Ah Poh to Liang to collect $3400 from the Accused.

141    I found that the Accused’s allegation about 8899 having to return money to the Accused incredible. There was clear evidence that the Accused was the one who handed a sum of money for his Malaysian supplier through Liang. He did not even have any record of the alleged winnings or losses arising from the horse betting. In fact, such allegation was not made in his long statements as well as his cautioned statement. The Accused was clearly lying.

142    The Prosecution referred the Accused to s/n 23 and 24 of P12, Annex D and he disagreed that these messages did not come from 8899. In my view, these messages suggested that the Accused was a punter as the message to him read: “ see u want to bet”. It was not a case of 8899 placing bets with the Accused. It was inconsistent with his allegation that he was collecting horse betting from the Malaysian boss.

143    There were many other areas of inconsistencies in the Accused’s evidence. He claimed that the drugs were for his own consumption but when confronted with P30 \[22\] which stated “Sometimes I will also share the drugs with my friends”, he then turned around to deny that was what he had told the recorder. He alleged that he told the IO “I enjoy drugs with my friends”.

144    The Prosecution also highlighted the inconsistency of P9, Q5A5 with the account the Accused told to Dr Stephen Pang and Inspector Quah (PW15) but again the Accused replied that the statement was wrongly recorded and was not read back to him. The Prosecution then read to the Accused the conclusion of P9, which stated, “I now concluded the Contemporaneous Statement of Gan Ann Kiat. The above statement consisting of 15 questions and 15 answers was read back to B1 in Hokkien and he confirmed it to be true and correct. B1 does not want to amend the above statement.” The Accused again disagreed it was read to him and said that he was merely asked to sign without it being read to him. Exhibit P9 showed that the Accused knew that Liang had placed two black bundles with the Accused while they were in the car.

145    Next, the learned DPP then confronted him with his psychiatric report provided by Dr Stephen Phang where he told the doctor that the things were put on the gear elevator. Despite this, the Accused persisted in saying that he did not know the exact location. See Day 6 NE, page 32, lines 22 – 32.

146    The Accused also disagreed that what was stated at P30 \[26\] that he did not know what he swept away in the car were two black bundles but only knew about it after the officers found them was contrary to P10 \[12\] where he said he felt two square shaped bundles. When questioned further, the Accused admitted he knew there were two bundles which he knew was squarish. He also added that he only knew two bundles when it dropped. He claimed that he did not see what Liang had passed to him. He claimed that it was too dark at the car park. The Accused even denied that what he swept away were the things that Liang had given him. He claimed that what he swept was the food placed by his wife and did not know what the items Liang gave were. See Day 6 NE, pages 54 -55. I found this to be an incredible story. Clearly, the Accused was making up his defence as he went along. Moreover, it was contrary to P10 \[11\] and \[12\].

147    The Prosecution also highlighted to the Accused that his claim that he ordered 50 grams of Methamphetamine was inconsistent with his statement, P29, paragraph 9 where he said, “Over the phone, I told Lao Ban I wanted 25 grams of Leng eh and 25 grams of ‘Sio Kway’. He explained it was a mistake made by the IO who wrote it wrongly, as it was inconsistent with A3 in P9. Clearly, the Accused relied on P9 when it suited him otherwise he would claim that P9 was not read to him and he was merely asked to signed.

148    I found the Accused even denied that he had told Dr Phang that the bundles were square as stated in P10. He claimed that it was written by Dr Phang and not coming from him despite the fact that Dr Phang had testified that the words in italics in P10 came from the Accused and the Accused’s confirmation earlier during the cross examination that the contents of P10 were accurate. The Accused testified that: “When I swept it away, I just told him that, 'Oh, I felt something like a square’, but I did not tell him that it is a square. I only tell him, I think it’s roughly like a square”. See Day 6 NE, page 67. The Accused initially even denied that he had touched the bundles. If so, how could he have swept it away?

149    In these circumstances, I found the Accused to be an untruthful witness, not worthy of any credit.

## Accused was in Possession of the Bundles

150    I found that there were overwhelming evidence that the Accused was in possession of the two bundles containing the drugs.

151    Exhibit P12 was the forensic report of the examination of GAK-HP1 prepared by Lee Catherine Susan. From this mobile phone and SIM card, P12 showed the phone and WhatsApp contacts; the call records from 1 March to 11 April 2017 and all SMS, MMS and WhatsApp messages from 1 March to 11 April 2017.

152    Based on P12, it was clear that the name 8899 and the Malaysian phone +XXX – was the Malaysian supplier that the Accused purchased the drugs from and was the same person who had told Liang to deliver the drugs to the Accused on 11 April 2017. It also showed that both of them were in communication with each other. The Accused agreed that serial number 19 at page 11 of annex D, P12 was his communication with the Malaysian supplier 8899 in Chinese text. P15 was the translated text in English of P12 annex D, page 11.

153    The Accused admitted that on the day in question, he went to meet Liang to collect drugs. He admitted that Liang placed drugs in his car. See page 82, Day 6 NE. See also P8 where the Accused admitted that “Ah Liang give me two”. He claimed he did not know it was diamorphine. He thought it was ‘leng eh’. I disbelieved his evidence that he thought it was ‘leng eh’.

154    Next, at pages 61 to 62 of Day 6 NE, the Accused admitted that he knew two square shaped bundles when he swept them. His admission was also recorded by Dr Stephen Phang in P10. These two bundles were subsequently established to contain not less than 10.14 grams of diamorphine. The Accused also admitted in P28 that the deliveryman “placed goods near to the gear level.”

155    I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that “PW13 LKL met the accused to conduct a drug transaction. PW13 LKL was supposed to pass the accused the drugs, and the accused was supposed to pay PW13 LKL. The transaction had taken place. PW13 LKL stated that the Supplier instructed him to deliver the Bundles to the accused.[^1] He also testified that he placed the Bundles near the Car’s gear stick and collected the accused’s cash.[^2] The accused was aware that PW13 LKL placed the Bundles in the Car. The accused stated in his statements that he was aware that PW13 LKL had placed “something” in his Car.[^3] The accused told PW7 Dr Phang that he felt “two bundles, square-shaped” when he swept them with his hands.[^4] The accused also confirmed during his EIC that PW13 LKL had “put the _bundles_ in my car and took the monies”.[^5]

156    In the circumstances, I found that the Accused was in possession of the two bundles ordered by him and delivered to him by Liang.

## Accused knew that the Bundles contained Diamorphine

157    I found that the Accused knew that the two bundles found in his possession contained diamorphine.

158    Firstly, I found that Teo Ah Poh had told Liang to deliver ‘Re shui’, which was the street name for diamorphine to the Accused. On previous occasions, the Accused had also ordered ‘Re shui’. Liang confirmed that the Accused only bought ‘Re shui’. Liang also confirmed that on that day, he had only the two bundles for the Accused.

159    Next, having regard to P8, I agreed with the Prosecution that the caller was puzzled by the Accused who kept asking the two things were to be passed to who. The caller was certain that the Accused ordered the two things. On the other hand, this was how the Accused explained at Day 6 NE, page 58 about P8: “_Well, if you can see the original, then you---you realise that the timing was also being cancelled out and I wasn’t asked to sign there, and no one had actually read this back to me. If you just take a look, this will be on the 2nd page of the original, and even the 1st page, so many cancellations. Yet there is no signature to confirm that there were amendments being made. So---and there was no reading back of the statement to me and there is nowhere in this that is written that this was read back to me in either Hokkien or Mandarin or whatever. So if this is really a true account, then I would request for the officers to produce the records of this conversation because they---at that point of time, they have their handphones around, they can actually record the conversation if this is true.”_ The Accused insisted that the caller did not insist that the two items belonged to him. In my view, the Accused was not telling the truth. When confronted with incriminating evidence against him, the Accused would resort to casting aspiration on the integrity of the CNB officer (PW5) who recorded P8. He even went to the extent to say that P8 were fabricated by the CNB officer (PW5). I rejected the allegation that PW5 fabricated P8. I found PW5 had no motive to do so. Clearly when confronted with incriminating evidence, the Accused will make wild allegations against the CNB officers and even the interpreter PW16. P8 was also consistent with the evidence of Liang. I noted that the Accused even accused Liang of lying despite the fact that he had earlier conceded that Liang had no motive to do so. P21 at page 21, serial number 169 to 171 where the caller with the phone numbers +XXX which shared the same phone number as 8899 told Lee Kwor Liang, “Liang I got the things already two C’s.” Clearly, the Malaysian supplier had arranged to give the Accused the two bundles. In fact, on the day in question, two black bundles were recovered from the Accused’s car. This was also consistent with P8.

160    The Accused claimed that what he ordered were for 50 grams of Methamphetamine and not diamorphine. I rejected this allegation.

161    Firstly, the Accused was evasive when it was put to him that “you would have returned the bundles to Lee Kwor Liang immediately, if the order was indeed wrong.” He claimed that he did not see what was passed to him and yet he allowed Liang to take the sum of $3400. The $3400 cannot be for the purchase of 50 grams of Methamphetamine as according to PW14, the street price would be about $1700 to $1800 and lower if obtained from Malaysia. Moreover, the size of the two bundles were much bigger than what he alleged to have ordered, namely, 50 grams of methamphetamine. As stated earlier I found that he knew they were two square shaped bundles.

162    The Accused was also evasive in answering when asked whether he knew Liang placed something in his car despite what he said in P10 \[11\] and \[12\]. See Day 6, page 75 and 76. He did not admit even when shown his own cautioned statement P28. The Accused did not even want to admit that he knew Liang placed the drugs. In my view, the Accused clearly knew that Liang had placed the bundles containing the drugs.

163    In P29 \[6\], the Accused admitted that PW13 was the deliveryman assigned by the Malaysian supplier to deliver drugs to him. PW13 was to deliver “hot” to the Accused. See serial number 704, at page 25 of 30 in P17. PW13 in his statements (exhibits P22 and P23) clearly implicated the Accused. PW13 was told by Teo Ah Poh to deliver the two bundles to the Accused. Teo Ah Poh told him that these contained ‘Re Shui’. PW13 added that the Accused only bought ‘Re Shui’ and nothing else. See P22 at \[14\] and P23 at \[36\]. ‘Re Shui’ is the street name for diamorphine.

164    Next, the Accused’s phone conversation with the Malaysian supplier showed clearly that the delivery of the two bundles were for the Accused. See exhibit P8. This was corroborated by the message sent to PW13 to deliver the “two” things to the Accused. I agreed with the Prosecution that “there could not have been a mistake in the drug order as the amount that the Supplier asked PW13 LKL to collect from the accused ($3,400)[^6] matches the amount seized from PW13 LKL after the transaction.[^7]”

165    I rejected the Accused’s assertion that he ordered 50gm of Methamphetamine for his own consumption. “If the accused had indeed ordered 50 grams of methamphetamine, he would have noticed the discrepancy in the size and quantity of the Bundles and rejected them immediately. The fact that he accepted the Bundles unquestioningly showed that he knew their contents and there was no mistake in the delivery.” See \[80\] of the Prosecution’s submission.

## Bundles were for the Purposes of Trafficking

166    The Prosecution relied on the presumptions under s 17(c) of the MDA to prove that the Accused possessed the bundles for the purposes of trafficking. I found that the Accused failed to rebut the presumption on the balance of probabilities.

167    I have found that the two bundles were in the possession of the Accused. It was not disputed that the two bundles were analysed and found to contain 10.14 grams of diamorphine. Therefore, under s 17(c) of the MDA, the Accused was presumed to have the drug in his possession for the purposes of trafficking. In fact, the large quantity of diamorphine strongly suggested that the drugs were for the purposes of trafficking rather than for the Accused’s consumption.

168    Having rejected the Accused’s allegation that the drugs were for his own consumption, there was no positive evidence adduced by the Accused as to what he planned to do with these two bundles. The Accused had therefore failed to rebut the presumption under s 17(c) of the MDA.

169    Besides the statutory presumption, there were clear evidence that the Accused was trafficking in drugs. I found that the Accused’s mobile phone record showed that he was in the business of drug trafficking. The Accused had texted the Malaysian supplier stating that he was “not waiting anymore” and wanted the supplier to “give \[him\] back the money” as he “cannot run \[his\] business anymore”. These showed that the Accused was involved in the business of dealing with drugs. I also disbelieved his evidence that he did not have to sell drug to earn money and had no pressing debts owing to others.

170    The Accused was unable to give a reasonable explanation as to why on 9 April 2017, he received the following suspicious text message from an unknown sender “Bro can keep for me and later my bro wake up I go take from u”. See exhibit P12, Annex A4-2, p 12 at entry no. 21. In my view, this message indicated that the Accused was involved in dealing with drugs.

171    Next, I found that exhibit P21, s/n 7 and 84, were corroborative evidence that the Accused was trafficking in “hot”, a slang for diamorphine, and consistent with P15, s/n 30, the message: “Today if can bring one over, tomorrow also can”. This message was sent to the Accused on the day before his arrest.

## Conclusion

172    Considering all the circumstances, I rejected the Accused’s contention that he had ordered 50grams of Methamphetamine but what was delivered was diamorphine, which he did not know. I was satisfied that the elements of the charge against the Accused had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. I therefore found the Accused guilty and convicted him on the charge.

173    Given the quantity of the drugs involved, the Prosecution submitted for the mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment without any additional term of imprisonment in lieu of caning. The Accused did not make any mitigation plea. I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission and sentenced the Accused to 20 years’ imprisonment.
