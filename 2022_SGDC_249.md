## STATEMENT OF AGREED FACTS

2       Both parties had agreed and signed a Statement of Agreed Facts (SOAF) (together with an agreed list of exhibits attached to the SOAF) which provided as follows:

> “1.    The accused is Cheng Jin Quan Mark.

> 2.    The co-accused is Loh Zhi Xiang. He is also known as Jeff.

> 3.    Zabel Global Investments Ltd (“Zabel”) was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on 30 August 2013.Jeff was a director of Zabel from 30 August 2013. Another involved party, Peh Wei Siang (“Wei Siang”) was also a director of Zabel from 30 August 2013 until on or around February 2014. The accused was employed as the Director (Operations) of Zabel. His letter of employment is admitted as Exhibit ASOF-1.

> 4.    From April 2014 to June 2014, investors invested capital into funds managed by Zabel. Investors’ monies were pooled and used to trade in shares. The funds marketed comprised the following:

>> a.    Zabel Assured Sovereign 12 (“ZAS12”), which was marketed by Chow Siew Wan Alice (“Alice”), a consultant with Zabel. About 16 investors invested about SGD7.6 million in ZAS12 from April – June 2014. The factsheet that Alice showed to all the investors represented that no management fees were charged for this fund and that performance fees would only be payable if the fund’s returns exceeded 12% per annum. The factsheet is seen at Exhibit ASOF2. The documentation signed by these investors stated the same (i.e. that there were “0% management fees”).

>> b.    Zabel Assured 12, which was marketed by Tan Kim Lin, a consultant with Zabel. It collected about S$25,000 from one investor (Sam Phui Lin) on 26 May 2014. This fund charged 1.5% management fees per annum if the fund made a profit.

>> c.    Zabel Assured Special, which collected about SGD731,124 from six investors. It was represented to these investors that 0% management fees would be charged for this fund and the documentation signed by these investors stated the same. This fund was set up to invest in shares of Heng Fai Enterprises Limited.

> 5.    These investors’ details are attached in the Annex. Their contract notes with Zabel, where available, are collectively admitted in Exhibit ASOF-3. Zabel had no other sources of income apart from the funds that it managed, which the accused knew.

> 6.    Zabel’s abovementioned activities fell within the definition of “fund management” under the Second Schedule of the Securities and Futures Act (Cap 289) (“SFA”) and is thus a regulated activity requiring a Capital Markets Services (“CMS”) licence from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). At the time that Zabel was conducting the regulated activity between April 2014 and June 2014, Zabel did not hold the requisite CMS licence, nor was it exempt from the requirement to have a CMS licence. Zabel has thereby committed an offence under Section 82(1) punishable under Section 82(3) SFA.

> 7.    The accused opened a UOB Kay Hian trading account XXX (“the accused’s UOBKH trading account”) on 25 February 2014. The account opening form is admitted as Exhibit ASOF-4. This account was opened solely for Zabel’s use as a temporary measure until bank accounts were opened in Zabel’s name. The letter confirming this arrangement, dated 25 Feb 2014, is admitted as Exhibit ASOF-5.

> 8.    The accused also opened a personal UOB Current Account XXX (“the accused’s UOB account”) on 1 March 2014. The UOB account was opened for the purpose of receiving funds from the UOBKH trading account. The letter confirming this arrangement, dated 15 March 2014, is admitted as Exhibit ASOF-6.

> 9.    The funds that Zabel collected from its investors from all three abovementioned schemes were deposited into the accused’s UOBKH trading account. When these monies were to be paid out, they were withdrawn from the accused’s UOBKH trading account, deposited into the accused’s UOB account, and thereafter withdrawn from the latter. The only monies flowing into the accused’s personal UOB account from 17 April 2014 to June 2014 were from his UOBKH trading account[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) and the accused knew this.

> 10.    In April 2014, the following emails were exchanged between the accused, Jeff, and/or Alice regarding the documents used to promote the ZAS12 fund.

>> a.    Email dated 17 March 2014 at 12.30 p.m. from Jeff to the accused titled “Re: Slides and Commission” with attachments titled:

>>> i.    Annex Details\_V1\_17032014.pdf;

>> d.    An email from Alice to the accused titled “factsheet add Capital Assured” on 13 April 2014 at 11.16 p.m.; with attachment (Collectively admitted as Exhibit ASOF-10); and

>> e.    An email from the accused from his personal email to his Zabel email titled “Re: factsheet add Capital Assured” on 14 April 2014 at 2.50 a.m. with attachment titled “Zabel Assured Sovereign 12- Final 140414.pdf” (Collectively admitted as Exhibit ASOF-11).

> 11.    On 22 May 2014, S$3,125,000 was transferred from the accused’s UOB account to Heng Fai Enterprises Limited for the purchase of 53,000,000 Heng Fai placement shares. The fund transfer form is admitted as Exhibit ASOF-12.

## PROSECUTION’S CASE

3       To prove its case against the AP, the prosecution relied on the above SOAF, called 4 witnesses (namely, Loh Zhi Xiang (Jeff) (“PW1”); Chow Siew Wan (Alice) (“PW2”); Peh Wei Siang (“PW3”); and Tiah Lan Tim Lynne (“PW4”) with a list of 34 exhibits.

## CLOSE OF THE PROSECUTION’S CASE

4       At the close of the prosecution’s case, the defence made an application on no case to answer which I had dismissed for the following reasons:

> **_Law on application on no case to answer_**

> (a)     Sections 230(1)(e), (j) and (k) of the Criminal Procedure Code (“**CPC**”) set out the procedures which must be complied with at the trial in all courts as follows:

>> _“(1)(e):_      _the prosecutor must then examine his witness, if any, and each of them may in turn be cross-examined by the Accused and every co-Accused, after which the prosecutor may reply to the submission;”_

>> _“(1)(j):_      _…if after considering the evidence referred to in paragraph (e), the court is of the view that there is some evidence which is not inherently incredible and which_ **_satisfies each and every element of the charge_** _as framed by the prosecutor or as altered or framed by the court_, **_the court must call on the Accused to give his defence_**_;”_ (emphasis added)

>> _“(1)(k):.. the court must order a discharge amounting to an acquittal if it is of the view that there is no such evidence as referred to in paragraph (j)”._ (emphasis added )

> (b)     Section 230(1)(j) of the CPC is the statutory codification of the test set out in the seminal decision of the Privy Council in _Haw Tua Tai and others v PP_ _\[1981 – 1982\] SLR(R) 133 at \[17\]_ that:

>> “_As a decider of law, the judge must consider whether there is some evidence (not inherently incredible) which, if he were to accept it as accurate, would establish each essential element in the alleged offence. If such evidence as respects any of those essential elements is lacking, then, and then only, is he justified in finding “that no case against the accused has been made out which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction” …”_

> (c)     In _Re Nalpon Zero Geraldo Mario_ _<span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 440</span> (“Re Nalpon”) (at \[26\])_, the High Court had made the following observations:

>> “_In essence, at the close of the Prosecution’s case, the judge must, keeping in mind the distinction between primary facts and inferred facts, ask himself: “If I were to accept the Prosecution’s evidence as accurate, would I establish the case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.”_

> (d)     In _PP v Wong Wee Keong and another appeal \[2016\] SHC 84_, the High Court, after citing _Re Nalpon_ laid out the following guiding propositions when deciding whether to call on the accused to enter his defence (at \[33\]) (emphasis added) below:

>> (i)       All evidence of primary fact should be accepted as being true, unless it is **so inherently incredible** that no reasonable person would be able to accept it as being true or if it **has been discredited** or shown to be wholly unreliable.

>> (ii)       It is not enough that the inference may be credible or not inherently incredible. In this regard, there is a different standard which applies to primary facts and inferences insofar as the former should be accepted as true unless it is inherently incredible whereas inferences can only be accepted if they can reasonably be drawn. It is not necessary that the inference be irresistible or that it must be the only possible inference that may be drawn from the facts.

>> (iii)        **The totality of the evidence has to be considered** when determining whether evidence is so inherently incredible that it can be accepted or if the inferences sought to be drawn are reasonable enough to pass muster. **The court cannot only look to those parts of the evidence which are favourable to the prosecution’s case and ignore those which are detrimental**; i.e., it cannot pick out only the plums and leave the duff behind.

> **_Dismissal of the defence application on no case to answer_**

> (e)     After careful consideration of the Statement of Agreed Facts and the documentary evidence therein, the testimonies of the 4 prosecution witnesses, and the written submissions of both parties, I found no merit in the defence submissions and I dismissed the defence application on no case to answer for reasons as follows:

>> _1st charge in DAC-930902-2019_

>> (i)       As regards the 1st charge in DAC-930902-2019, I accepted the prosecution submissions that the prosecution has adduced evidence that is not inherently incredible of all the elements of the 1st charge. Both parties agreed that from April to June 2014, Zabel carried on business in fund management, a regulated activity pursuant to the Second Schedule of the SFA, when it had neither a CMS licence from the MAS to conduct the said activity, nor any exemption from the requirement to have a CMS license. Zabel had thus committed an offence under s 82(1) r/w s 82(3) SFA[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5). There is some evidence that the AP purported to act in the capacity of a manager of Zabel, as he had executive control in Zabel.

>> (ii)       The terms “manager” and “officer” bear similar connotations. In particular, both terms connote that a “manager” and an “officer” is one that who exercises an executive function or holds an executive position in the company, or purports to act in any such capacity. This is clear from the following legislation and caselaw:

>>> (1)       The term “officer” is defined in Section 331 of the SFA as follows:

>>>> _“officer”, in relation to a body corporate, means a_ **_director_** _, member of the committee of management_, **chief executive, manager, secretary or similar officer of the body**_, and_ **_includes a person purporting to act in any such capacity_**.” (emphasis added)

>>> (2)       Section 4 of the Companies Act 1967 provides further guidance as to the definition of an officer as follows:

>>>> _“officer”, in relation to a corporation, includes –_

>>>>> (a)     _any_ **_director_** _, or_ **_secretary_** _of the corporation or_ **_a person employed in an executive capacity_** _by the corporation;_

>>>>> (b)     _a receiver and manager of any part of the undertaking of the corporation appointed under a power contained in any instrument; and_

>>>>> (c)     _any liquidator of a company appointed in a voluntary winding up_.” (emphasis added)

>>> (3)       In _Rozawi Bin Mustaffa v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] SGDC 80</span>, the court found that the three offenders had acted in the capacity of managers of a company for the purposes of offences under the Immigration Act (Cap 133) because they were in “positions of authority and decision-making”: at \[69\]. Specifically, they had been actively involved in managing the company’s business, which included the authority to employ and terminate the employment of workers: at \[80\]. The court stated that (at \[68\]) “_the term “manager” should be given its natural and ordinary meaning as one who is in_ **_charge of the affairs_** _of the company or one who has_ **_executive control or authority_**_. The title or lack thereof is immaterial_.” (emphasis added)

>>> (4)       In _Hasan Shofiqul v China Civil (Singapore) Pte Ltd_ _<span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 511</span> (“Hasan”)_ at \[64\], the High Court provided useful guidance on the definition of an “executive” and stated that _“\[t\]he courts will approach the question of whether an employee is employed in an executive position by_ **_looking at all the circumstances of the case_**”. (emphasis added)

>>> (5)       The High Court in _Hasan_ relied on the decision _in Brightway Petrochemical Group Singapore Pte Ltd v Ang Lily_ _<span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR(R) 729</span>_ and set out the relevant facts to take into consideration to determine whether an employee is employed in an executive position and held (at \[11\] to \[15\]) as follows:

>>>> (a)       The description ‘managerial, executive or confidential’ position although not defined by the said Act, must be ascertained from the terms, express or implied of the contract of employment, and includes those relating to the remuneration, designation and responsibilities of the employee as well as his qualifications. All relevant factors must be taken into consideration, each given its appropriate weight.

>>>> (b)       As the respondent reported to the finance manager, this indicated that she was playing more of a supportive role although her designation stated in the job offer letter was “accountant”. While the respondent was in a new set-up with only two of them in the finance department, namely, the finance manager and herself, she did not have any supervisory functions or any staff under her charge. Her work involved setting up the company’s accounts, filing of vendor bills, issuing cheques, preparing payment vouchers, creating petty cash and payment voucher forms, booking air tickets for the staff, arranging for interviews for candidates for the operation manager, making enquiries of the medical check-up procedures and performing other duties assigned by the finance manager. Even though setting up the company’s accounts was one aspect of her work, she would probably be doing so under the direct supervision of the finance manager, whom she reported to. After considering all the relevant circumstances and the nature of her employment, the respondent’s duties and responsibilities were predominantly administrative and non-confidential in nature.

>>>> (c)       As the respondent was a diploma holder and did not have an accountancy degree, this fortified the court’s view that she was not employed in a managerial, executive or confidential position, although the court accepted her counsel’s contention that the higher the salary, the less likely it would be a clerical position. But this was not the only factor that the court had to take into account.

>> (iii)       In my view, the AP with the assigned title of “Director Operations” with no shares or directorship in Zabel is an officer of Zabel employed in an executive capacity as he has purported to act as a manager in charge of the affairs of Zabel with executive control or authority in Zabel based on following evidence:

>>> (1)       PW1 testified that he, the AP and PW3 were all involved in managing Zabel and had equal say in that regard.[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) He mentioned several decisions that they made collectively, including the decisions: to use a current account in the AP’s name to hold Zabel’s monies until a corporate account could be set up for Zabel;[^7] not to charge investors administrative and management fees, and to only charge them performance fees after Zabel had exceeded an overall return of 12% per annum;[^8] and how much Zabel ought to invest into the Heng Fai Enterprises share placement.[^9]

>>> (2)       PW1 also testified that each of the trio had different areas of responsibility: the AP handled Zabel’s sales, PW3 handled investments and PW1 did administrative work.[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10) Each of them did not need to seek approval from the other two for decisions within their respective spheres[^11] as shown when PW3 executed a trade on behalf of Zabel using the UOBKH Trust Account to buy 250,000 Hyflux shares at the price of SGD 1.18 (the “Hyflux Trade”)[^12] on 25 June 2014 on his own accord without the AP’s confirmation. As for the AP, he had hired salespeople for Zabel like Alice (PW2) and Tan Kim Lin without seeking approval from either PW1 or PW3.[^13] The salespeople also reported to the AP, not to PW1 or PW2.[^14] The AP did not contradict any of the above evidence.

>>> (3)       The AP signed several of the investors’ contract notes, as a director of Zabel, on behalf of Zabel.[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15) After investors sent in application forms, they were given contract notes that set out the terms of their investment with Zabel[^16] and which plainly denote Zabel’s acceptance of the same. By signing the contract notes, the AP was in effect committing Zabel to a contractual relationship with the investors.

>>> (4)       The defence assertion that PW1 named PW3 as the “_person who controlled Zabel_” mischaracterised PW1’s evidence. Though PW1 agreed that PW3 was the _‘mastermind’ of Zabel_[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17), he explained that he understood this to mean that PW3 _“came up with the ideas … the whole business model”_. He expressly clarified that he did not mean by this answer that “_every decision has to go through \[PW3\] for approval_”.[^18] PW1 also explained that he said PW3 was “technically” in control of Zabel because the latter was in charge of investments, Zabel’s only source of revenue: “_without \[PW3\] doing his job … \[the\] company would collapse_”.[^19] This had nothing to do with extent of executive control that PW3 wielded in Zabel, much less the AP’s role in Zabel. Thus, when viewed in its proper context, PW3’s evidence does not support the defence at all.

>>> (5)       As for PW4’s evidence, her perception of the AP’s role in Zabel is of little utility to the defence because she was not involved in Zabel’s business. PW4 managed a company which provided corporate secretarial services to Zabel. Her assistance in the incorporation of Zabel on 30 August 2013 preceded the AP’s involvement in Zabel.[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20) Further, there is no evidence that she had interacted with the AP, PW3, and/or PW1 on matters apart from the provision of the aforesaid services. Accordingly, she would not have any knowledge of how Zabel had been managed from April to June 2014, or the AP’s role in the same. Her evidence thus cannot shed any light on whether the AP had purported to act as a manager of Zabel. In this regard, I rejected the defence submissions that based on PW4’s evidence[^21], the AP was a ”_mere employee”_, “_an unknown…business development person”_, or a mere _“runner”_ who is not involved in the management of Zabel and “_did not call the shots_” in relation to the corporate structure of Zabel.

>>> (6)       As for the last element of the charge that the AP consented to Zabel carrying on business in fund management without a CMS licence, to show that the officer of a company consented to an offence by said company under s 331(1) SFA, the prosecution must prove that the officer knew “the material facts that constituted the offence” by the corporate entity, and “have agreed to its conduct of business on the basis of those facts”.[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22) Applying this to the present situation, the prosecution must show that the AP was (1) aware that Zabel was carrying on fund management without such a licence and (2) had agreed to Zabel doing so.

>>> (7)       The defence assertion that the element of consent requires proof that the AP knew Zabel required a CMS licence to conduct fund management is misconceived. The offence under s 82(3) SFA is established once it is shown that Zabel had undertaken a regulated activity without a CMS licence and does not require further proof that Zabel subjectively knew it required a CMS licence to conduct said activity.

>>> (8)       Similarly, secondary liability under s 331 SFA does not require proof of any licensing requirement. This is evident from the case of _PP v Tan Seo Whatt Albert_ _<span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 654</span>_ where the offender, a manager of a company, pleaded guilty to offences under s 240(1) r/w s 331(3A) SFA for consenting to the said company offering securities to investors without a prospectus. The offender claimed at his sentencing and on appeal that he genuinely believed that a prospectus had not been required. The High Court noted that the plea of guilt had been validly taken as the requirement of consent under s 331 SFA “does not require that the individual has knowledge of the legal requirements giving rise to the primary offence” because “a requirement for knowledge of a need for a licence is tantamount to undermining the principle of _ignorantia juris non excusat_ (ignorance of the law excuses not)”.[^23]

>>> (9)       The case of _PP v Nancy Tan Mee Khim_ _<span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 230</span>_ (MA 9423/2020) further affirmed this position. The offender, the director of a company, was convicted after trial on a charge under s 82(3) r/w s 331(1) SFA for consenting to the said company dealing in securities without a CMS licence. She claimed in her defence that she sought legal advice from three different lawyers as to whether her company was in breach of the applicable regulations. The trial court not only rejected this claim, it found that, even if the offender had received improper legal advice, this would be a mistake of law irrelevant to her liability.[^24] The High Court dismissed the offender’s appeal against conviction and sentence.

>>> (10)       There is no legal basis for the defence assertion that it must be proved that the AP knew Zabel required a CMS licence to conduct fund management before he may be said to have consented to Zabel’s offence under s 82(3) SFA. To the contrary, all that needs to be shown is that the AP knew Zabel was carrying on business in fund management without a CMS licence and had agreed to Zabel’s conduct of business on that basis.

>>> (11)       There is evidence of both the aforesaid requirements. The AP knew Zabel was carrying on business in fund management without a CMS licence. He admitted in his statement to the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) that he knew Zabel did not have a CMS licence and that PW1 and PW3 told him Zabel did not need one[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25). This is consistent with PW1’s evidence that PW3 told him and the AP that Zabel did not require a CMS licence to conduct fund management because it was an offshore company.[^26] The AP also conceded this, given that the defence put to PW3 that he (PW3) had told the AP that no licence was required for Zabel to conduct fund management.[^27] Further, the AP agreed to Zabel’s conduct of business in fund management on that basis. Moreover, despite knowing Zabel did not have a CMS licence, the AP accepted investments from clients by signing their contract notes and processing their paperwork. He also received funds from investors which he proceeded to deal with.[^28] The AP’s active participation in Zabel’s business showed that he had agreed to Zabel’s conduct of fund management without a CMS licence. In this regard, I rejected the defence submissions and reliance on the evidence of PW1 to PW4 that the AP cannot be said to have given his consent within the meaning of s 331(1) of the SFA as there has not been any evidence adduced from any of the 4 prosecution witnesses stating that the AP had known during the relevant period that the carrying out by Zabel of the regulated activity required a CMS licence.

>>> (12)       In the light of the above, I rejected the defence submissions that:

>>>> (i)       the AP was not an officer of Zabel within the ambit of s 331(1) of the SFA and did not purport to act as a manager of Zabel as his involvement with Zabel was restricted only to that of an ordinary employee relating to sales, recruitment of new relationship managers and dealing with the administrative aspect of such recruitment;

>>>> (ii)     the AP can be said to have consented to Zabel carrying out a regulated activity without the CMS licence only if he had knowledge that Zabel required the CMS licence to carry out its activities and consented to performing the regulated activity without the CMS licence; and

>>>> (iii)    no evidence had been adduced by the prosecution to show that the AP was an officer of Zabel within the ambit of s 331(1) of the SFA as he purported to act as a manager of Zabel, and he had consented to Zabel carrying out a regulated activity without the CMS licence.

> _2nd to 4th charges in in DAC 930903-5 of 2019_

> (f)     The 2nd to 4th charges in DACs 930903-5 of 2019 concerned the commissions that the AP paid to PW1, himself, and PW2 out of the AP’s UOB current account. The AP set up a UOB Kay Hian trading account and a UOB current account for the purposes of holding money from Zabel’s investors. The latter account received monies solely from the aforementioned trading account.

> (g)     “Criminal conspiracy” is defined under s 120A(1) of the Penal Code as follows:

>> “**_When a person agrees with another person to commit an offence or cause an offence to be committed_**_, such an agreement is designated a criminal conspiracy_.” (emphasis add)

> (h)     In _PP v Yeo Choon Poh_ _<span class="citation">\[1993\] 3 SLR(R) 302</span>_, the Court of Appeal stated (at \[19\]) that the essence of a conspiracy is agreement. However, in most cases the actual agreement takes place in a private setting. In such circumstances, direct evidence of such an agreement will rarely be available. To that end, the Court also noted that proof of an agreement could be inferred from the words and actions of the parties as follows (at \[20\]):

>> “**_One method of proving a conspiracy would be to show that the words and actions of the parties indicate their concert in the pursuit of a common object or design, giving rise to the inference that their actions must have been co-ordinated by arrangement beforehand_**_. These actions and words do not of themselves constitute the conspiracy but rather constitute evidence of the conspiracy.”_ (emphasis added)

> (i)     The inference of a conspiracy was further clarified by the High Court in _Er Joo Nguang v PP_ _<span class="citation">\[2000\] 1 SLR(R) 756</span>_ (“_Er Joo Nguang_”) (at \[35\]):

>> “_So far as proof goes, conspiracy is generally a matter of inference deduced from certain acts of the accused parties, done in pursuance of an apparent criminal purpose in common between them. Both the surrounding circumstances and the conduct of the parties before and after the alleged commission of the crime will be useful in drawing an inference of conspiracy…_ **_An inference of conspiracy would be justified only if it is inexorable and irresistible, and accounts for all the facts of the case_**.” (emphasis added)

> (j)     The elements of the offences under s 406 r/w s 109 PC are as follows:

>> (i)       The AP had been entrusted with Zabel’s monies in his UOB account.

>> (ii)       There was a conspiracy between the AP and PW1 to dishonestly misappropriate these monies. Dishonest misappropriation refers to the act of assigning monies for a wrong use,[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29) whilst knowing that one is not legally entitled to do such act;[^30] and,

>> (iii)       Pursuant to said conspiracy, the AP transferred the various sums stated in the charges to himself, PW1 and PW2.

> (k)     I rejected the defence submissions that the prosecution case is bereft of evidence of any conspiracy (or agreement) between the AP and PW1 to dishonestly misappropriate and commit criminal breach of trust of Zabel’s monies as the prosecution case is that the AP and PW1 agreed to dishonestly misappropriate Zabel’s monies by paying commissions to themselves and PW2 out of the monies in the AP’s personal UOB current account even though they knew that they were not legally entitled to use these monies for this purpose. Specifically, both the AP and PW1 knew that the monies in the AP’s UOB current account comprised capital from Zabel’s investors; Zabel did not charge its investors any management fees and would only charge performance fees on returns exceeding 12% per annum; and Zabel’s returns had not exceeded 12% at the time the commissions were paid out in May – June 2014. Zabel was thus not entitled to charge its investors any such fees or to use any of their funds for its own expenses. It flows from this that PW1 and the AP knew that they were not entitled to use the monies in the AP’s UOB current account to pay commissions. However, they agreed to do so, and did so anyway.

> (l)     There is evidence proving the existence of a conspiracy between PW1 and the AP as follows:

>> (i)       PW1 had testified that he, the AP, and PW3 had agreed to pay commissions to themselves and PW2 using the investors’ funds in the AP’s trading account, even though they knew Zabel had not reached returns of 12% per annum, because PW3 said he was confident of making back the promised returns with the remaining funds.[\[note: 31\]](#Ftn_31) However, PW3’s optimism does not alter the fact that they were not legally entitled to use the funds from Zabel’s investors to pay commissions to themselves at the time that they did.

>> (ii)       In this regard, PW1 had pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiring with the AP to dishonestly misappropriate Zabel’s monies under s 406 r/w s 109 PC in relation to the sums paid to himself. He also consented to the two other charges concerning the payments to the AP and PW2 being taken into consideration for sentencing.[\[note: 32\]](#Ftn_32) The Statement of Facts that PW1 admitted to without qualification sets forth his _mens rea_ as well as the details of the aforementioned conspiracies.[^33]

> (m)     The existence of a conspiracy between PW1 and the AP is further corroborated by the AP’s statements to the CAD where he stated that:

>> (i)       The monies in the AP’s trading account belonged to Zabel’s investors and that Zabel should invest these monies.[\[note: 34\]](#Ftn_34)

>> (ii)       The AP knew that Zabel’s clients were not charged any management fees.[\[note: 35\]](#Ftn_35)

>> (iii)       The AP, PW1 and PW3 had agreed to pay commissions to themselves and to PW2.[\[note: 36\]](#Ftn_36) They did so because PW3 said profits “_will definitely exceed 12%”_ and so they could draw commissions “_in expectations \[sic\] that there will be a surplus of profits more than 12% from 31 May 2014”_[^37]. and,

>> (iv)       The AP believed that these commissions ought not to have been paid without first confirming that profit of more than 12% had been obtained.[\[note: 38\]](#Ftn_38)

> (n)     There is evidence to show that the AP and PW1 specifically knew of and had agreed to make each of the payments mentioned in the 3 charges preferred against the AP. PW1 admitted to this without qualification when he was sentenced.[\[note: 39\]](#Ftn_39) As for the AP, it is not disputed that he had sole access to his personal UOB current account in his name[^40] – had he not agreed to these payments, they could never have been made. Further, PW1 signed two letters setting out the payments made to the AP[^41], and both the AP and PW1 were copied in correspondence concerning PW2’s commission.[^42]

> (o)     The defence argument that there is no evidence of a conspiracy between the AP and PW1 because PW1 denied that there was “_a secret agreement \[between him and the AP\] to act dishonestly by taking away money from the investors_”;[\[note: 43\]](#Ftn_43) and because PW3 denied that PW1 and the AP planned to “_siphon off money belonging to Zabel’s investor \[sic\] for their own benefit”_,[^44] is overly simplistic. Whether PW1 and the AP had conspired to dishonestly misappropriate Zabel’s money is a legal question which neither PW1 nor PW3 can answer as laypeople. They can only attest to the facts, and PW1’s account (as explained above) in fact supports the prosecution case theory. In this regard, I rejected the defence submissions that none of the 4 prosecution witnesses has offered a shred of evidence of any conspiracy or arrangement between PW1 and the AP to commit breach of trust of Zabel’s monies based in their testimonies given in Court.

> (p)     Further, the defence questions posed to PW1 and PW3 did not accurately capture the meaning of the various legal concepts involved, i.e. ‘conspiracy’, ‘dishonestly’, and ‘misappropriate’. Contrary to what the defence suggested to PW1, conspiracy does not in fact require a ‘secret’ agreement[\[note: 45\]](#Ftn_45), as based on the case authorities cited above, the essence of a conspiracy is agreement and what is required and has been adduced in evidence by the prosecution at the close of its case is that the words and actions of the parties, namely the AP and PW1, indicated their agreement and concert in the pursuit of a common object or design, giving rise to an inexorable and irresistible inference that their actions must have been co-ordinated by arrangement beforehand and accounts for all the facts of the case. In addition, dishonesty under s 24 PC does not require proof of personal gain, yet the defence repeatedly questioned PW3 on whether the AP acted for his “own benefit” or “own personal gain” in making the requisite payments.[^46]

> **_Conclusion on application on no case to answer_**

> (q)     Based on the totality of the evidence adduced by the prosecution at the close of its case, I took the view that the prosecution has adduced evidence that is not inherently incredible on all the elements of the 1st charge in DAC 930902 of 2019, as well as for the element of conspiracy for the 2nd to 4th charges in DAC 930903-5 of 2019. The defence application on no case to answer must therefore be dismissed and the AP must be called to give his defence pursuant to s 230(1)(j) of the CPC. Accordingly, I administered the standard allocution to the AP who elected to give evidence in his own defence and also to call 2 witnesses from UOB Kay Hian, Peh Yew Hin (DW1) and Tan Mei Loo (DW2). However, the defence subsequently decided not to call DW2 as a witness.

## ISSUES FOR DETERMINATION

5       After careful consideration of the written submissions, responses and replies of both parties, my determination on each of the following legal and/or factual issues arising from the trial is as follows:

> **_Issue (1): Whether each of the prosecution witnesses (PW1 to PW4) is credible and truthful, and why? In particular, is PW3 a credible and truthful witness and should any part of his testimony be accepted, and why?_**

> **_PW1’s credibility_**

> (a)     I agreed with both parties that PW1 is a credible and truthful witness as he had already been convicted and sentenced for his role in these events at the time of his testimony and he thus has no reason to lie. He had pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiring with the AP to dishonestly misappropriate Zabel's monies under s 406 read with s 109 of the PC (the 2nd charge (DAC-930907-2019)). He had consented to the 3rd and 4th charges (DAC-930908-2019 and DAC-9309092019 respectively) being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. These charges correspond to the s 406 charges faced by the AP.

> (b)     However, I took the view that PW1’s oral evidence is to be accepted and preferred over the oral evidence of the AP and PW3 as well as the other prosecution and defence witnesses only when his oral evidence is also materially corroborated by the AP’s statements to CAD, the evidence of the other credible prosecution witnesses, and/or other contemporaneous documents. I accepted the prosecution submission that the purported differences that the defence have highlighted between PW1’s evidence and that of the other witnesses do not affect his credibility because they are in truth not discrepancies and even if they are discrepancies, they may be explained by the motive of the other witnesses to lie (eg PW3 and the AP given the charges against them), or their limited knowledge of the facts in dispute (eg PW4).

> (c)     In this regard, I found that PW1’s denial in his oral evidence that there was _“a secret agreement \[between him and the AP\] to act dishonestly by taking away money from the investors_” should be disregarded since, as admitted by the defence, PW1’s aforesaid oral evidence is inconsistent with his position as seen in the court documents relating to his previous convictions in DAC-930907-2019, and DAC-930908-2019 and DAC-930909-2019, both of which had been taken into consideration for purposes of sentencing and the said charges correspond to the s 406 charges faced by the AP. Below are some examples of PW1’s evidence which I had accepted in preference over the AP’s evidence in my determination of the issues arising from the trial:

>> (i)       As PWI had testified that he had never been told that Zabel’s funds had already generated returns[\[note: 47\]](#Ftn_47), but he and the AP had used investors’ monies to make payments despite knowing that Zabel’s returns had not exceeded 12% per annum because of PW3’s assurance to him and the AP in person that he would achieve the necessary returns[^48], I accepted PW1’s evidence and rejected the AP’s evidence that he was made to believe that Zabel’s return on investment had exceeded 12% per annum as PW3 had instructed him to make the withdrawals from the UOB account.

>> (ii)       I accepted PW1’s evidence on the AP’s role and found that the AP with the assigned title of “Director Operations” with no shares or directorship in Zabel is an officer of Zabel employed in an executive capacity as he has purported to act as a manager in charge of the affairs of Zabel with executive control or authority in Zabel.

>> (iii)       As regards PW1’s evidence on whether Zabel requires a CMS licence, I took the view that this is a legal issue for the court’s determination and not a factual matter to be decided based on the views or opinion of PW1 or any other witness.

>> (iv)       I accepted PW1’s evidence that the AP signed the contract notes as the head of sales[\[note: 49\]](#Ftn_49) and that the AP had only joined Zabel a few months after it was incorporated, and that thereafter they assumed co-equal roles[^50] without bothering to make changes to the register of directors because of the costs involved.[^51]

>> (v)       PW1’s evidence that he and the AP had used investors’ monies to make payments despite knowing that Zabel’s returns had not exceeded 12% per annum because PW3 assured them _in person_ that he _would_ achieve the necessary returns.[\[note: 52\]](#Ftn_52)

>> (vi)       Though PW1 agreed that PW3 was the _‘mastermind’ of Zabel_[\[note: 53\]](#Ftn_53), he explained that he understood this to mean that PW3 _“came up with the ideas … the whole business model”_. He expressly clarified that he did not mean by this answer that “_every decision has to go through \[PW3\] for approval_”.[^54] PW1 also explained that he said PW3 was “technically” in control of Zabel because the latter was in charge of investments, Zabel’s only source of revenue: “_without \[PW3\] doing his job … \[the\] company would collapse_”.[^55] This had nothing to do with extent of executive control that PW3 wielded in Zabel, much less the AP’s role in Zabel.

> **_PW2’s credibility_**

> (d)     While I agreed with the defence that PW2 is a credible and truthful witness, I took the view that her evidence that PW3 had told her that Zabel did not require a CMS licence is irrelevant as this a legal issue for the court’s determination and not a factual matter to be decided based on her views or opinion, or that of PW3 or any other witness. I agreed with the prosecution and accepted PW2’s evidence identifying the AP as a decision-maker in Zabel as follows:

>> (i)       PW2 said that the decision as to what fees to charge investors would have been made by PW3 and the AP.[\[note: 56\]](#Ftn_56) This shows that PW2 did not perceive PW3 to be superior to the AP.

>> (ii)       PW2 also testified that she suggested changes to the fund factsheet to the AP and waited to receive the approved version from him so that she could commence marketing the scheme.[\[note: 57\]](#Ftn_57) Although the AP asserted belatedly that he had been tasked to convey PW2’s input on the factsheet to PW3 and _vice versa_ like a “postman”,[^58] this, as submitted by the prosecution, is implausible given that PW2 and PW3 were already in contact and could have liaised directly with each other on the same. The AP’s other explanation that he could approve the addition of “capital guaranteed” as seen in ASOF-11 because it had already been pre-agreed, does not address the nub of the issue: that the AP was able to make changes to Zabel’s fund factsheet as he wished.

> **_PW3’s credibility_**

> (e)     I agreed with both parties that PW3 is not a credible and truthful witness. He has been charged with sixteen (16) charges relating to his involvement in Zabel and there were strong reasons and indeed, motivation, for PW3 to downplay his involvement in Zabel in order to avoid or mitigate his criminal liability. He denied any involvement in the management and affairs of Zabel. Despite being a director and shareholder of Zabel, PW3 denied having knowledge or having sight of the AP’s Employment Letter[\[note: 59\]](#Ftn_59) which was signed off by one Mr Edwin Tan as the Human Resource Director of Zabel Global Pte Ltd at that time, and whom PW3 denied knowing or being acquainted with.[^60] Further, PW3 denied receiving any letter of termination or reasons for his termination from UOB Kay Hian[^61], and it was only after his notice of termination by UOB Kay Hian dated 3 July 2014[^62] (“Notice of Termination”) was adduced by the defence that PW3 admitted to receiving the said Notice of Termination[^63].

> (f)     As pointed out by the defence, pursuant to the Notice of Termination, PW3 was terminated from his employment at UOB Kay Hian for, _inter alia_, managing/controlling Zabel, which purported to be vehicles for the investments funds; representing to potential third party investors that the investment funds or Zabel were related to, associated with and/or managed by UOB Kay Hian; and/or that UOB Kay Hian provided investment services to them; and procured and/or facilitated the opening of trading accounts in the names of the AP and Zabel with a view to procuring transfers of monies from third party investors in the investment funds into such accounts, which he falsely represented to be an investment trust account maintained by UOB Kay Hian for the purposes of managing such monies and in respect of which such investors constituted beneficiaries.

> (g)     I agreed with the defence that it is absurd that PW3, as a director of Zabel at that time, could not have known that the AP had been employed by Zabel. It is also preposterous that he could not recall or deny receiving a termination letter or reasons for his termination, especially so given that the reasons for his termination were due to his above egregious conduct.

> (h)     It is trite that even if there are any discrepancies between the evidence of various witnesses as well as contradictions in a witness’s own evidence, there is no rule of law that the testimony of a witness must be believed in its entirety or not at all, and it falls to the court to assess which part of a witness’s testimony is credible and the court is fully competent to accept one part of the witness’s testimony and to reject the other[\[note: 64\]](#Ftn_64).

> (i)     While I found PW3 not to be a credible and truthful witness, I did not reject his testimony entirely and I have accepted those parts of his testimony which are not self- serving, or seek to exculpate himself of criminal liability or mitigate it, or are corroborated by any documentary evidence or the evidence of other credible prosecution witnesses. Some examples of PW3’s evidence which I had accepted and taken into account in my determination of the issues arising from the trial are as follows:

>> (1)       PW3’s evidence that Zabel’s investments comprised only the trading of stocks and shares in the AP’s UOBKH trading account and the private placement of shares in Heng Fai Enterprises,[\[note: 65\]](#Ftn_65) and that neither generated profit within the material period[^66] as his evidence is corroborated by the tabulation of the realised gains and losses from the trades in the AP’s UOBKH trading account from March to June 2014 in ASOF-25[^67] which shows clearly that there was a net loss over this period.

>> (2)       PW3 had denied[\[note: 68\]](#Ftn_68) the existence of any representation to the AP that the Heng Fai Enterprises placement had generated 300% profit as claimed by the AP. The AP’s claim that PW3 told him the placement would and had yielded profits of 300% by June 2016[^69] is contradicted by other documentary evidence showing that PW3 had represented the indicative returns to be much more modest, and to be paid yearly. The emails that PW3 sent to the AP and others to introduce the Heng Fai Enterprises placement stated that it would produce about 8 – 10% returns per _annum_; even taking into account a discount on the share price which PW3 claimed would be given, the returns would be about 20%.[^70]

>> (3)       PW3’s evidence that he did not decide to engage salespersons for Zabel and that they did not report to him[\[note: 71\]](#Ftn_71) was corroborated by PW2’s evidence that as far as administration, she reported to the AP[^72] which, as submitted by the prosecution, does not support the case of either party on whether the AP held executive authority in Zabel as it does not shed light on who gave instructions to PW2 regarding the conduct of her work in Zabel, or who she was accountable to as an agent of Zabel.

>> (4)       In this regard, I rejected the defence submission and agreed with the prosecution that as PW2 did not testify that she reported to PW1 or PW3 for anything as since her testimony was that she “only \[knew\]” the AP and PW3, and that they were the “only 2 person \[she\] \[contacted\]”, it may be inferred that she did not have significant interaction with PW1.[\[note: 73\]](#Ftn_73) While PW2 did testify that DW1 had told her to liaise with PW3 who in turn told her that paperwork would go to the AP [^74], this however does not address the issue of _what_ matters PW2 had spoken to PW3 about or whether she reported to PW3.

> **_PW4’s credibility_**

> (j)     While I agreed with the defence that PW4 is a credible and truthful witness, I have rejected her evidence on the AP’s role as an employee as PW4 did not have any knowledge on how Zabel had been managed and the AP’s role on the same.

> **_Issue (2): Whether the AP is a credible and truthful witness, and why?_**

> (a)     I rejected the defence submissions that the AP is a credible and truthful witness as his oral testimony is inconsistent with his CAD statements and contained various contradictions by way of new and vivid details in his testimony not mentioned in and critically different from his CAD statements, and the AP had given no plausible explanations during his trial. In addition, his oral testimony is inconsistent with the more reliable testimonies of PW1, in particular, and of PW3 in some aspects (as explained under Issue (1) above) as well as other documentary evidence adduced by the prosecution.

> (b)     Some examples of the AP’s inconsistencies and contradictions in his evidence which I had rejected in my determination of the issues arising from the trial are as follows:

>> (i)       the AP’s evidence on his role as a mere employee is inconsistent with PW1’s evidence which I have accepted for the reasons as explained under Issue (1) above. His evidence is also inconsistent with the evidence of PW3 and PW2 on his control over Zabel’s sales and hiring of salespeople for Zabel like PW2 and Tan Kim Lin as PW3 had testified that he did not decide to engage salespersons for Zabel and that they did not report to him,[\[note: 75\]](#Ftn_75) and PW2 stated that as far as administration, she reported to the AP[^76] which, as submitted by the prosecution, does not support the case of either party on whether the AP held executive authority in Zabel as it does not shed light on who gave instructions to PW2 regarding the conduct of her work in Zabel, or who she was accountable to as an agent of Zabel.

>> (ii)       The AP’s evidence on his role as a mere employee is also inconsistent with other objective documentary evidence. He had sent emails in April and June 2014 to four persons he recruited to act as sales representatives for Zabel, where he told them to report directly to him.[\[note: 77\]](#Ftn_77) His control over sales is further evidenced by his act of signing the investors’ contract notes as a director of Zabel and on behalf of Zabel.[^78] PW1 had testified that the AP signed the contract notes as the head of sales.[^79] These contract notes set out the material terms of the investors’ investment with Zabel[^80] and were provided to them after they submitted application forms. The AP had agreed that by signing the contract notes, he committed Zabel to a contractual relationship with the investors.[^81] This is a clear demonstration of his executive authority in Zabel.

>> (iii)       The AP’s evidence that PW3 had told him that the potential returns for Heng Fai Enterprise share placement were 2 to 3 times of the original investment[\[note: 82\]](#Ftn_82) was inconsistent with PW3’s evidence and the tabulation of the realised gains and losses from the trades in the AP’s UOBKH trading account from March to June 2014 in ASOF-25[^83] which shows clearly that there was a net loss over this period.

>> (iv)       I rejected the AP’s evidence that PW3 had told him that Zabel would eventually obtain a CMS licence when DW1 joined Zabel as it was not open to the AP, as a matter of law[\[note: 84\]](#Ftn_84), to claim that he had asked both PW1 and PW3 and was repeatedly misled by and had relied on the advice of PW1 and PW3 to believe that Zabel did not require a CMS licence to carry out its activities as an offshore company.

> **_Issue (3): Whether the defence witness (DW1) is credible and truthful, and why?_**

> (a)     I agreed with the defence that DW1 is a credible and truthful witness since he is a neutral party as he is not a party to the proceedings and does not face any charge, and despite his familial relationship with PW3 who is his nephew, he gave evidence which undermined PW3’s evidence as follows:

>> (i)       Contrary to PW3’s testimony, DW1 did not render any advice to PW3 or Zabel relating to the CMS licence requirements.[\[note: 85\]](#Ftn_85)

>> (ii)       PW3 claimed that he checked with DW1 to confirm with UOB Kay Hian compliance department if the fund factsheet can state that “Dealing, Research and Trustee Services” were done by UOB Kay Hian[\[note: 86\]](#Ftn_86). However, DW1 testified that PW1 did not check or consult him on whether the fund factsheet could state that “Dealing, Research and Trustee Services” were done by UOB Kay Hian[^87].

>> (iii)       DW1 was not aware that Zabel was in the business of fund management[\[note: 88\]](#Ftn_88).

> **A. The s 82(3) r/w s 331(1) SFA Charge**

> **_Issue (4): Whether the AP purported to act as a manager of Zabel ?_**

> (a)     The elements of the charge under s 82(3) r/w s 331(1) SFA are as follows:

>> (i)       Zabel carried on business in a regulated activity without a CMS licence for the said activity, and as such, had committed an offence under s 82(3) SFA.

>> (ii)       The AP purported to act in the capacity of a manager of Zabel and was thus an officer of Zabel.[\[note: 89\]](#Ftn_89)

>> (iii)       The AP consented to Zabel carrying on business in a regulated activity without the requisite CMS licence.

> (b)     The first element is not disputed as it is agreed between the parties that, from April to June 2014, Zabel committed an offence under s 82(1) r/w s 82(3) SFA by carrying on business in fund management, a regulated activity pursuant to the Second Schedule of the SFA, when it had neither a CMS licence from the MAS to conduct the said activity nor any exemption from the requirement to have a CMS license.[\[note: 90\]](#Ftn_90)

> (c)     As regards the second element of the charge, I rejected the defence submissions and accepted the prosecution submissions and I found that the AP with the assigned title of “Director Operations” with no shares or directorship in Zabel is an officer of Zabel employed in an executive capacity as he has purported to act as a manager in charge of the affairs of Zabel with executive control or authority in Zabel for the following reasons :

>> (i)       The legislation and caselaw cited by the parties in their submissions relating to the defence application on no case to answer at the close of the prosecution case remain relevant to my determination on this issue of the terms “officer” and “manager” as used in the SFA.[\[note: 91\]](#Ftn_91)

>> (ii)       In the present case, the AP purported to act in the capacity of a manager and thus as an officer of Zabel because he had executive control in Zabel. He had an equal say in Zabel’s management together with PW1 and PW3 and was in charge of Zabel’s sales. PW1 had testified that he, the AP and PW3 were all involved in managing Zabel and had equal say.[\[note: 92\]](#Ftn_92) He highlighted several significant decisions that they had made collectively, including: to hold Zabel’s monies in a UOB account in the AP’s name until a corporate account in Zabel’s name was set up[^93]; not to charge investors administrative and management fees, and to only charge performance fees after Zabel had exceeded an overall return of 12% per annum[^94]; and on how much Zabel ought to invest into the Heng Fai Enterprises placement[^95]. PW1 had also testified that they discussed the orientation and sales process at the onset of Zabel’s fund management activities[^96].

>> (iii)       PW1’s account that the AP had an equal say in Zabel’s management is underscored by his evidence that the trio were to receive equal commissions for April 2014. This is corroborated by the AP’s email dated 16 May 2014 to PW3 requesting that these sums be withdrawn to his UOB account (Exhibit ASOF18), as well as his statement to CAD on 8 Nov 2017 at Q608 (Exhibit ASOF-22). This implicitly undermined the AP’s claim that his role in Zabel was like an “introducing postman” – if so, he would not have received the same remuneration as PW1 and PW3, the persons that he claimed made all the decisions for Zabel. Accordingly, the AP had purported to act in the capacity of a manager and thus as an officer of Zabel as he, PW1 and PW3 ran Zabel’s business in consensus.

>> (iv)       As regards the inconsistency between PW1’s evidence and PW3’s evidence where PW1 had testified that PW3 had an equal say in managing Zabel in 2014 and decided on Zabel’s investments[\[note: 97\]](#Ftn_97), while PW3 denied having control over Zabel after he joined UOBKH as a dealer in early 2014[^98] and claimed that he merely recommended investments to the AP who would make the final call[^99], I agreed with the prosecution that PW1 is more credible and his evidence ought to be preferred to PW3’s evidence as PW1 had already been convicted and sentenced for his role in these events at the time of his testimony[^100] and thus has no reason to lie. In contrast, PW3’s proceedings were still ongoing when he gave evidence[^101]; in particular, he faced a charge under s 82(3) r/w s 331(1) SFA for purporting to act in the capacity of a manager of Zabel from April to June 2014. He thus had an incentive to downplay his involvement in Zabel to exculpate himself of liability for the same.

>> (v)       PW1 had also testified that each of the trio took charge of different aspects of the company: the AP had charge of Zabel’s sales, PW3 investments, and PW1 administrative work[\[note: 102\]](#Ftn_102). Each of them did not need to seek approval from the other two for decisions within their respective spheres[^103]. In line with this, the AP hired salespeople for Zabel like PW2 and Tan Kim Lin without seeking approval from either PW1 or PW3[^104]. The salespeople also reported to the AP and not to PW1 or PW3[^105]. The AP’s control over Zabel’s sales is corroborated by that of the other prosecution witnesses and the objective evidence. PW3 similarly testified that he did not decide to engage salespersons for Zabel and that they did not report to him.[^106] PW2 stated that as far as administration, she reported to the AP[^107] which, as submitted by the prosecution, does not support the case of either party on whether the AP held executive authority in Zabel as it does not shed light on who gave instructions to PW2 regarding the conduct of her work in Zabel, or who she was accountable to as an agent of Zabel. The AP also sent emails in April and June 2014 to four persons he recruited to act as sales representatives for Zabel, where he told them to report directly to him.[^108]

>> (vi)       I agreed with the prosecution and accepted PW2’s evidence identifying the AP as a decision-maker in Zabel as follows:

>>> (1)       PW2 said that the decision as to what fees to charge investors would have been made by PW3 and the AP.[\[note: 109\]](#Ftn_109) This shows that PW2 did not perceive PW3 to be superior to the AP.

>>> (2)       PW2 also testified that she suggested changes to the fund factsheet to the AP and waited to receive the approved version from him so that she could commence marketing the scheme.[\[note: 110\]](#Ftn_110) Although the AP asserted belatedly that he had been tasked to convey PW2’s input on the factsheet to PW3 and _vice versa_ like a “postman”,[^111] this, as submitted by the prosecution, is implausible given that PW2 and PW3 were already in contact and could have liaised directly with each other on the same. The AP’s other explanation that he could approve the addition of “capital guaranteed” as seen in ASOF-11 because it had already been pre-agreed, does not address the nub of the issue: that the AP was able to make changes to Zabel’s fund factsheet as he wished.

> (d)     In this regard, I rejected the following defence claim and submissions:

>> (i)       The defence claim that the fact that the AP was not appointed as a director of Zabel shows that he did not have executive control is a nonstarter. PW1 had testified that the AP had only joined Zabel a few months after it was incorporated, and that thereafter they assumed co-equal roles[\[note: 112\]](#Ftn_112) without bothering to make changes to the register of directors because of the costs involved.[^113] In any event, a person’s formal appointment in a company or lack thereof sheds no light on the role they actually play therein. The defence must itself acknowledge this as the AP himself was not a director of Zabel at the material time but the evidence showed that the AP had been making decisions for Zabel. In this regard, I rejected the defence submission that as taking the necessary steps to make changes to the register of directors is a clear representation of a company’s formal appointment of a director, and is also evidence of one’s acceptance of the role of director of a company, no evidence has been adduced by the prosecution which shows that the AP accepted such a role.

>> (ii)       Though the defence has cited the AP’s emails dated 10 March 2014 and 11 March 2014[\[note: 114\]](#Ftn_114) to Tan Kim Lin and (PW2) respectively, informing Tan Kim Lin and PW2 that PW1 and PW3 had decided to appoint them as directors and shareholders of Zabel and also informing Tan Kim Lin that both PW1 and PW3 would appoint other directors who would oversee certain roles in Zabel in support of the AP’s contention that he did not have the power to hire sales representatives for Zabel, I agreed with the prosecution that these are statements by the AP which do not shed light on the truth of who made these decisions as it is clear from the evidence adduced at the trial that the AP had the power to hire sales representatives for Zabel. Further, the defence did not put its case to either PW1 or PW3 for their explanation in breach of the rule in _Browne v Dunn[^115]_ and as such, their evidence in this regard ought to be taken as undisputed. Therefore, I found that the AP’s recruitment of salespersons or relationship managers was not subject to the final decision and confirmation of PW1 and PW3.

>> (iii)       Contrary to the defence submissions, I accepted the prosecution submission that ASOF-18 does not show that the AP played a subservient role _vis-à-vis_ PW3 simply because he requested PW3’s “help” to withdraw monies to his UOB account. It was the consistent evidence of PW1,[\[note: 116\]](#Ftn_116) PW3,[^117] and the AP[^118] that PW3’s assistance was required for monies to be drawn from the UOBKH trading account to the AP’s UOB account and it is in this light that ASOF-18 ought to be construed.

>> (iv)       As for the AP proffering multiple reasons in a bid to discredit the emails where he told the salespeople of Zabel to report directly to him, I rejected them as afterthoughts, as submitted by the prosecution. When questioned about Jonathan, the AP had claimed that Jonathan did not end up reporting to the AP because Jonathan “decided not to join in the end”, and that the AP told him to report to him as a “one-off instance”.[\[note: 119\]](#Ftn_119) Yet after he was confronted with _three more emails_ where he had told three other salespersons of Zabel to report directly to him, which clearly undermined this explanation, the AP’s answer then shifted in re-examination to them only reporting to him for administrative matters[^120]. Plainly, the AP was simply inventing excuses to explain these emails and make them comport with his defence that he had no executive authority in Zabel.

>> (v)       Just because the AP received the same commission for April 2014 as PW1 and PW3 does not necessarily mean that the AP had an equal say in Zabel’s management as I accepted PW1’s evidence that the AP, PW1 and PW3 had equal say in Zabel.

>> (vi)       The AP’s explanation of the breakdown of the April 2014 Remuneration showed that the AP was not a mere postman receiving $25,000 remuneration and had referred to his role involving salespeople for Zabel like PW2 and Tan Kim Lin, and the evidence adduced at the trial showed that the AP did not merely introduce sales agents such as PW2 and Tan Kim Lin to Zabel and the ultimate decision of recruiting or rejecting such sales agents did not lay with PW1 and PW3.

>> (vii)       Even if the AP’s statement to the CAD that PW1 and PW3 made the decision to distribute the commissions equally between the trio were true, this does not relegate the AP to a mere runner or employee of Zabel as I accepted PW1’s evidence on the AP’s role in Zabel.

>> (viii)       The AP’s evidence that any reporting by the sales agents to him was only because he was the point of contact between the sales agents and PW1 and PW3 and such reporting was only limited to _administrative matters_[\[note: 121\]](#Ftn_121) were clearly afterthoughts.

>> (ix)       The AP’s evidence that the emails he had circulated to the sales agents were standard template emails and he had no one reporting to him were clearly afterthoughts, and contrary to PW1’s evidence on the AP’s role in charge of Zabel sales, as well as PW2 who stated that as far as administration, she reported to the AP[\[note: 122\]](#Ftn_122) which, as submitted by the prosecution, does not support the case of either party on whether the AP held executive authority in Zabel as it does not shed light on who gave instructions to PW2 regarding the conduct of her work in Zabel, or who she was accountable to as an agent of Zabel.

> (e)     The AP’s control over sales is further evidenced by his act of signing the investors’ contract notes as a director of Zabel and on behalf of Zabel[\[note: 123\]](#Ftn_123). PW1 testified that the AP signed the contract notes as the head of sales[^124]. These contract notes set out the material terms of the investors’ investment with Zabel[^125] and were provided to them after they submitted application forms. The AP agreed that by signing the contract notes, he committed Zabel to a contractual relationship with the investors[^126]. This is a clear demonstration of his executive authority in Zabel. In this regard, the defence attempt to explain the AP’s signing of the contract notes as an “administrative function” and these contract notes being nothing more than administrative documents is undermined by the AP’s own evidence that his act of signing these notes committed Zabel to a contractual relationship with the investor.[^127]

> (f)     In his examination-in-chief, the AP denied that he was the person deciding who to engage salespersons for Zabel[\[note: 128\]](#Ftn_128) and these salespersons reported to him[^129]; and further claimed that he only signed the contract notes because PW1 told him to do so.[^130] I agreed with the prosecution that the AP’s aforesaid evidence should be rejected as afterthoughts given their belated nature. Further, and in any event, these claims were not put to any of the prosecution witnesses[^131], the consequence of which is that the court may treat any testimony left unchallenged as undisputed. The AP’s claims go to the heart of his defence that he did not purport to act as a manager of Zabel and there was no explanation for the defence omission to contradict the prosecution witnesses on these points. In this regard, I rejected the defence submissions that the AP’s involvement with Zabel was restricted only to that of an ordinary employee relating to sales, recruitment of new relationship managers and dealing with the administrative aspect of such recruitment and that PW1 and PW3 had the final say on recruitment.

> (g)     I also rejected the defence submissions that even though PW4 might not have been privy to all the internal workings of Zabel, her testimony should not be disregarded and should be given weight because PW4 was not involved in Zabel’s business and her observations were equivalent to those of an independent neutral outsider who had no interest to favour or be biased toward any party. In my view, PW4’s observations that the AP “_appeared to be an employee working for \[PW3\]…_”[\[note: 132\]](#Ftn_132), was not part of the management of Zabel and described him as a “_runner_”[^133], and the AP therefore did not take the helm and was not at the top of the hierarchal chain of command in Zabel during its incorporation process and would have to take instructions from PW1 and/or PW3 before conveying their instructions to other parties, are of no assistance to the court. PW4 was not involved in Zabel’s business as she merely managed a company which provided corporate secretarial services to Zabel. Her assistance in the incorporation of Zabel on 30 August 2013 preceded the AP’s involvement in Zabel.[^134] Further, there is no evidence that she had interacted with the AP, PW3, and/or PW1 on matters apart from the provision of the aforesaid services. Accordingly, she would not have any knowledge of how Zabel had been managed from April to June 2014, or the AP’s role in the same. Her evidence thus cannot shed any light on whether the AP had purported to act as a manager and was thus an officer of Zabel.

> (h)     As for whether the AP have any financial background or possess the necessary academic qualifications to hold an executive position in a fund management company such as Zabel, I took the view that this was an issue for PW1 and PW3 to decide together with the AP in the assignments of their respective duties at the relevant time and is therefore not a relevant issue for this Court’s consideration and determination.

> (i)     For the above reasons, I found that the AP had purported to act in the capacity of a manager and was thus an officer of Zabel because he had executive authority in sales and had hired salespeople for Zabel like PW2 and Tan Kim Lin without the need to seek approval from either PW1 or PW3 and the salespeople reported to the AP and not to PW1 or PW3. There is no requirement that a person must have complete or exclusive authority in a company before he is found to have acted as a manager of the said company. In this regard, the defendants in _Rozawi Bin Mustaffa_ were found to have acted as managers for the relevant company even though there was evidence to suggest that they took charge of different aspects of the business[\[note: 135\]](#Ftn_135).

> **_Issue (5): Whether the AP consented to Zabel carrying on a regulated activity without a capital markets services licence?_**

> (a)     There is no legal basis for the defence assertion that it must be proved that the AP knew Zabel required a CMS licence to conduct fund management before he may be said to have consented to Zabel’s offence under s 82(3) SFA. To prove that an officer of a company consented to an offence committed by the company under s 331(1) SFA, he must be shown to have known "the material facts that constituted the offence" by the company, and "to have agreed to \[the company's\] conduct of business on the basis of those facts"[\[note: 136\]](#Ftn_136). The case authorities of _PP v Tan Seo Whatt Albert <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 654</span>_ and _PP v Nancy Tan Mee Khim \[2020\] SGDC230 (MA 9423/2020)_ which I have cited when I dismissed the defence application on no case to answer at the close of the prosecution case remain applicable[^137].

> (b)     In the present case, the AP consented to Zabel's offence under s 82(1) SFA because he knew Zabel was carrying on business in fund management without a CMS licence and agreed to Zabel's conduct of business on that basis. There is evidence of both the aforesaid requirements. As submitted by the prosecution, the AP had conceded that he knew Zabel did not have a CMS licence from the onset of his participation in the company.[\[note: 138\]](#Ftn_138) This is corroborated by his statements to CAD[^139] and PW1’s evidence.[^140] The AP had also conceded that he had agreed to Zabel carrying on business in fund management even though he knew that Zabel did not have a CMS licence.[^141] This is borne out by his acts of recruiting salespeople like PW2 and Tan Kim Lin; marketing Zabel’s funds to potential clients through them; accepting investments from clients by signing their contract notes; and dealing with funds from these investors.[^142]

> (c)     In this regard, I rejected the defence submissions and found that the prosecution has proved that the AP knew that Zabel was carrying on a business in fund management; knew that Zabel was doing so without a CMS licence; and consented to Zabel carrying on a regulated business in fund management without a CMS licence.

> **_Issue (6): Whether PW1 and/or PW3 were involved in the management of Zabel?_**

> (a)     I agreed with the defence submissions that both PW1 and/or PW3 were involved in the management of Zabel for the following reasons:

>> (i)       PW1 had testified that each of the trio took charge of different aspects of the company: the AP had charge of Zabel’s sales, PW3 investments, and PW1 administrative work. Each of them did not need to seek approval from the other two for decisions within their respective spheres .

>> (ii)       As regards the inconsistency between PW1’s evidence and PW3’s evidence where PW1 had testified that PW3 had an equal say in managing Zabel in 2014 and decided on Zabel’s investments[\[note: 143\]](#Ftn_143), while PW3 denied having control over Zabel after he joined UOBKH as a dealer in early 2014[^144] and claimed that he merely recommended investments to the AP who would make the final call[^145], I had found (under Issue (1) above) that PW1 is more credible and his evidence ought to be preferred to PW3’s evidence as PW1 had already been convicted and sentenced for his role in these events at the time of his testimony[^146] and thus has no reason to lie. In contrast, PW3’s proceedings were still ongoing when he gave evidence[^147]; in particular, he faced a charge under s 82(3) r/w s 331(1) SFA for purporting to act in the capacity of a manager of Zabel from April to June 2014. He thus had an incentive to downplay his involvement in Zabel to exculpate himself of liability for the same. In this regard, I agreed with the defence that PW3 is not a credible and truthful witness as he has strong motivations to downplay his involvement in Zabel to avoid criminal liability.

> (b)     As PW1 had already been convicted and sentenced for his role in these events at the time of his testimony[\[note: 148\]](#Ftn_148) and thus has no reason to lie, I found PW1 to be a more credible witness than the AP and I was therefore unable to accept the AP’s evidence that he was not involved in the management of Zabel.

> (c)     For the reasons given under Issue (4) above, I rejected the defence submissions that the ultimate decision in relation to matters pertaining to the recruitment of salespersons or relationship managers lay in the hands of PW1 and PW3.

> **_Issue (7): Whether PW1 and/or PW3 were involved in Zabel carrying on a regulated activity without a capital markets services licence, and if so, does this exonerate the AP from any criminal liability under s 82 r/w s 331 SFA?_**

> (a)     I accepted the defence submissions that PW1 and/or PW3 were involved in Zabel carrying on a regulated activity without a capital markets services (CMS) licence. However, I took the view that this does not exonerate the AP from any criminal liability under s 82 r/w s 331 SFA for the following reasons:

>> (i)       Under Issue (5) and the reasons given therein, I have rejected the defence submissions and found that the prosecution has proved that the AP knew that Zabel was carrying on a business in fund management; knew that Zabel was doing so without a CMS licence; and consented to Zabel carrying on a regulated business in fund management without a CMS licence.

>> (ii)       The case authorities of _PP v Tan Seo Whatt Albert_ _<span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 654</span>_ where the High Court held that the requirement of consent under s 331 SFA “does not require that the individual has knowledge of the legal requirements giving rise to the primary offence” because “a requirement for knowledge of a need for a licence is tantamount to undermining the principle of _ignorantia juris non excusat_ (ignorance of the law excuses not”[^149], and also of _PP v Nancy Tan Mee Khim <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 230</span> (MA 9423/2020)_ where the court held that even if the offender had received improper legal advice, this would be a mistake of law irrelevant to her liability[^150], both of which I have cited and relied upon when I dismissed the defence application on no case to answer at the close of the prosecution case, remain applicable to this issue[^151].

>> (iii)       In this regard, I agreed with the prosecution that the defence has proffered no basis at all for its assertion that the involvement of PW1 and PW3 in Zabel should exonerate the AP from liability. The court’s observations in _PP v Nancy Tan Mee Khim_ that the offender had consented to the company’s s 82(3) SFA offence is merely an application of the law[\[note: 152\]](#Ftn_152) to the facts of the case. The court did not purport to establish a further requirement that _only_ the directing mind of a company may be proved to have consented to an offence by the said company. In any event, such a proposition would be plainly incorrect. There is nothing in law to state that only one person may act as an officer or manager of a company. As such, whether the AP had been told or advised by PW1 or PW3 or any other person that Zabel did not require a CMS licence is irrelevant to his liability.

>> (iv)       Further, I took the view that it was not open to the AP to claim, as a matter of law[\[note: 153\]](#Ftn_153), that he had asked both PW1 and PW3 and was repeatedly misled by and had relied on the advice of PW1 and PW3 to believe that Zabel did not require a CMS licence to carry out its activities as an offshore company. In this regard, I rejected the defence submissions that due to the mistaken belief created by PW1 and PW3, the AP could not have consented to Zabel carrying on a business in fund management without a CMS licence and the prosecution has not proffered a shred of evidence to show that the AP was acting on his own accord instead of on instructions from PW1 and PW3 as his bosses.

> (b)     In this regard, I rejected as without basis the following AP’s evidence that the AP had been continuously misled by PW1 and PW3 and believed**:**

>> (i)       PW1 and PW3 had consulted professionals who advised them that Zabel did not require a CMS licence to carry on its business of fund management;

>> (ii)       UOB Kay Hian's compliance would check and inform PW3 if Zabel required a CMS licence after the monies from the investors had been collected. PW3 would correspondingly inform the AP and PW3 of the same; and

>> (iii)       Matters relating to Zabel's licencing requirements would only be sorted out after DW1 joins Zabel.

> (c)     I also rejected the defence submissions that :

>> (i)       The AP naively trusted PW1 and PW3 as he was impressed by PW3's success and he was unfortunately unaware that the duo egregiously misled him into believing that Zabel did not require a CMS licence to carry out fund management;

>> (ii)       The AP’s gullibility should not be taken as him consenting to Zabel conducting fund management business without a CMS licence; and

>> (iii)       The obligation and responsibility to confirm whether Zabel required a CMS licence to carry out its activities did not lie with the AP as it was beyond his job scope.

> **B. The s 406 charges**

> **_Issue (8): Whether the AP was entrusted with Zabel’s monies in his personal UOB account no XXX ?_**

> (a)     The statutory provisions on the definition of “criminal conspiracy”, the case authorities on what is the essence of a conspiracy and how it is to be proved and the elements of the offences under s 406 r/w s 109 PC which have been set out earlier when I dismissed the defence application on no case to answer remain applicable to this issue[\[note: 154\]](#Ftn_154).

> (b)     The element of the offences under s 406 r/w s 109 PC that the AP transferred the various sums stated in the charges to himself, PW1 and PW2 is not disputed. Both the AP[\[note: 155\]](#Ftn_155) and PW1[^156] admitted that they agreed to make each of the payments in the charges, which is corroborated by the objective evidence.[^157] It is also not disputed that the AP made the relevant payments to himself, PW1 and PW2 from his UOB account in May and June 2014.[^158]

> (c)     As for the element of the AP been entrusted with Zabel’s monies in his UOB account, a person is ‘entrusted’ with property when he receives possession of said property with the knowledge that the entrusting party had, at least, possessory rights to the property, and he was to deal with the property in the manner instructed by the entrusting party.[\[note: 159\]](#Ftn_159)

> (d)     It is not disputed between the parties that:

>> (i)       the persons who had invested in Zabel’s funds deposited their capital into the UOBKH trading account in the AP’s name;[\[note: 160\]](#Ftn_160)

>> (ii)       Zabel was supposed to invest these monies;[\[note: 161\]](#Ftn_161)

>> (iii)       Zabel’s only inflow of monies was investors’ capital.[\[note: 162\]](#Ftn_162) It is thus clear that the Zabel’s monies in the AP ’s UOBKH trading account belonged to Zabel’s investors.[^163]

>> (iv)       the monies in the AP’s UOBKH trading account had first to be transferred to his personal UOB account before they could be withdrawn or otherwise used.[\[note: 164\]](#Ftn_164) As the account-holder, the AP was the only person able to withdraw monies from the said UOB account.[^165] He thus plainly had possession of the monies therein, and had therefore been entrusted with the monies of Zabel’s investors.

> (e)     I agreed with the defence that the evidence showed that the UOB Account and the corresponding UOB Kay Hian Trust Account belonged to Zabel at all material times as they were opened by the AP who was instructed by PW1 and PW3 to open the UOB Account and the UOBKH Trust Account under his name as there were some difficulties in opening a corporate bank account for Zabel as it was a foreign company[\[note: 166\]](#Ftn_166), and both PW1 and PW3 also told the AP that the purposes of the UOB Account and the UOB Trust Account were to serve as temporary corporate accounts until Zabel sets up its corporate account in its own name[^167]. The AP was asked to sign a letter of confirmation of ownership of the UOB Account dated 15 March 2014 (“Letter of Ownership for the UOB Account[^168]”) addressed to the management of Zabel[^169] which stated that:

>> (i)       the monies in the UOB Account belonged to Zabel as Zabel had full authority and ownership of the UOB Account;

>> (ii)       the arrangement was temporary pending Zabel setting up its corporate account in its own name. Upon Zabel opening its corporate account, all the monies in the UOB Account would be transferred to Zabel’s corporate account; and

>> (iii)       the withdrawals from the UOB Account would be authorised and done by PW3 and PW1.

> (f)     I accepted the defence submissions that pursuant to the Letter of Ownership for the UOB Account, it is clear that Zabel was the beneficial owner of the UOB Account. However, notwithstanding the terms of the Letter of Ownership for the UOB Account, the undisputed evidence showed that the Zabel’s monies in the AP’s UOBKH trading account belonged to Zabel’s investors[\[note: 170\]](#Ftn_170) and that the monies in the AP’s UOBKH trading account had first to be transferred to his personal UOB account before they could be withdrawn or otherwise used.[^171] As the account-holder, the AP was the only person able to access and withdraw monies from his personal UOB account.[^172] He thus plainly had possession of the monies therein, and had therefore been entrusted with the monies of Zabel’s investors.

> (g)     In this regard, I agreed with the prosecution that the defence argument that the money in the AP’s personal UOB account had not been entrusted to him because these monies belonged to Zabel and he had no authority to deal with them without PW1 or PW3’s approval holds no water. The defence itself acknowledges that entrustment is contingent on one’s receipt of _possession_ to property, _not_ ownership. The AP evidently had possession of the monies belonging to Zabel’s investors in his personal bank account given that the account was in his name and he was entrusted with the monies in the account which he withdrew and made payments to himself, PW1 and PW2. As such, I rejected the defence submissions that notwithstanding that the AP was the account holder of his personal UOB account, the AP was not in possession of the monies in his personal UOB account as he had no control over the same, and the AP was not entrusted with the monies in the UOB account since the AP did not have proprietary rights to the monies in the UOB account as he had no authority to deal with the monies therein without PW1 or PW3’s approval.

> (h)     Accordingly, I found that the AP was entrusted with Zabel’s monies in his personal UOB account no XXX.

> **_Issue (9): Whether the AP knew that the monies withdrawn from his personal UOB account no XXX comprised the capital from Zabel’s investors?_**

> (a)     I am unable to accept the defence submissions that evidence showed that the AP did not know that the monies withdrawn from his personal UOB Account comprised the capital from Zabel’s investors. It is clear from the evidence adduced at the trial that the AP knew he was not entitled to use the monies in his personal UOB account to make payments to himself, PW1 and PW2 in May and June 2014 because he knew that Zabel only charged investors fees if/when its returns exceeded 12% per annum and he also knew that Zabel had not achieved such returns at the material time. The AP had admitted to knowing, at the material time, that Zabel only charged its investors fees if/when it generated returns exceeding 12% per annum.[\[note: 173\]](#Ftn_173) This is also consistent with his statements to CAD [^174] where he admitted to CAD that he had paid commissions to himself, PW1 and PW2 out of the monies in his personal UOB account in the expectation that Zabel’s returns would exceed 12% per annum. He also stated in his statement that there was no explicit statement from PW3 to say that the fund had achieved more than 12% profits during its period of operations as PW3 only said that it will yield more than 12% profits[^175]. In this regard, I rejected the defence submission that there was no way that the AP could have ascertained whether Zabel’s returns on investments had exceeded 12% per annum, and that there was no resource available to the AP to ascertain whether the withdrawn monies comprised profits from Zabel’s investment or the capital from Zabel’s investors.

> (b)     I rejected as afterthoughts the following parts of the AP’s oral evidence which are either inconsistent with, or have been omitted by the AP in his above CAD statements:

>> (i)       Sometime in April to May 2014, PW3 informed the AP that he had invested in certain equities for Zabel that had yielded profits and such profits would exceed 12% per annum by 31 May 2013.[\[note: 176\]](#Ftn_176) On that basis, the AP believed that Zabel’s returns on investments had exceeded 12% per annum when PW3 had told him to release the funds from the UOB Account.

>> (ii)       The AP believed that the withdrawn monies comprised profits as PW3 told him that the profits will attain 12% by 31st May 2014; updated that he will release the funds for withdrawal only when the funds---when the---profits hit 12%, and thereafter, PW3 told the AP that the money has been already transferred because the profits has already been achieved[\[note: 177\]](#Ftn_177).

> (c)     I rejected the following defence submissions and found no basis that:

>> (i)       In the AP’s mind, PW3’s instructions to the AP to make the withdrawals meant that PW1 had done the necessary accounting and determined that the investments had exceeded 12% per annum and that both PW1 and PW3, based on their respective assigned roles in charge of Zabel’s administrative work and investments, had discussed and decided that the monies withdrawn from the UOB Account were profits from the investments.

>> (ii)       Without any alternative method to verify whether Zabel’s returns had exceeded 12% per annum, the AP could only rely on what was told to him by PW3, who was not only his superior but also the person in charge of handling Zabel’s investments.

> (d)     Accordingly, I found that the AP knew that the monies withdrawn from his personal UOB account no XXX comprised the capital from Zabel’s investors.

> **_Issue (10): Whether Zabel’s returns in April – June 2014 exceeded 12%?_**

> (a)     I agreed with the defence that factually Zabel’s returns from the period of April 2014 to June 2014 did not exceed 12% per annum. However, for the reasons as stated under Issue (9), I found that the prosecution has proved that the AP subjectively knew that Zabel’s returns had not exceeded 12% at that material time.

> **_Issue (11): Whether the AP acted dishonestly with respect to the monies that were withdrawn from his personal UOB account no XXX that comprised the capital from Zabel’s investors, and specifically, if he knew that commissions could not be paid out from the money from Zabel’s investors at the material time?_**

> (a)     The s 23 and s 24 Penal Code definitions of “dishonesty”, “wrongful gain” and “wrongful loss”[\[note: 178\]](#Ftn_178) and the case authorities on how to prove wrongful gain or loss which have been set out earlier when I dismissed the defence application on no case to answer remain applicable to this issue.

> (b)     The pertinent question, in the assessment of dishonesty in a CBT charge, is whether the accused intended to do an act that would cause wrongful gain or wrongful loss to another in circumstances where he knew that he was not legally entitled to do that act. Such an intention would often have to be proved by inference from the surrounding circumstances. The finding of dishonesty is premised on whether an accused knows that an action is unauthorised but nonetheless proceeds to execute it voluntarily.[\[note: 179\]](#Ftn_179) However, the mere fact that the property has been put to unauthorised use does not necessarily make the accused guilty of CBT as the accused is entitled to show that he genuinely believed that he could use the property in the unauthorised manner and that he was not dishonest.[^180] In order to establish the requisite element of dishonesty, the accused must know that the gain or loss was wrongful.[^181] Thus, where it can be shown that the accused genuinely believed that he was legally entitled to perform the relevant transactions, the accused cannot be said to have acted dishonestly.[^182]

> (c)     For the reasons as stated under Issue (9), I disagreed with the defence submissions and I found that as the AP knew and had admitted that Zabel’s investors were charged 0% management fees and the performance fees would only be payable if Zabel’s returns exceeded 12% per annum[\[note: 183\]](#Ftn_183), he had not been misled by PW3 to genuinely believe that Zabel’s returns on investments had exceeded 12% per annum.

> (d)     I agreed with the prosecution that the evidence adduced at the trial showed clearly that the AP knew he was not entitled to use the monies in his personal UOB account to make payments to himself, PW1 and PW2 in May and June 2014 because he knew that Zabel only charged investors fees if/when its returns exceeded 12% per annum, and he also knew that Zabel had not achieved such returns at the material time. The AP had admitted to knowing, at the material time, that Zabel only charged its investors fees if/when it generated returns exceeding 12% per annum.[\[note: 184\]](#Ftn_184) This is also consistent with his statements to CAD [^185] where he admitted to CAD that he had paid commissions to himself, PW1 and PW2 out of the monies in his personal UOB account in the expectation that Zabel’s returns would exceed 12% per annum. He also stated in his statement that there was no explicit statement from PW3 to say that the fund had achieved more than 12% profits during its period of operations as PW3 only said that it will yield more than 12% profits[^186].

> (e)     In this regard, I rejected as afterthoughts the following parts of the AP’s evidence which are either inconsistent with, or have been omitted by the AP in his CAD statements:

>> (i)       PW3 had represented to the AP that Zabel’s return on investment would exceed 12% per annum by 31 May 2014 and upon Zabel reaching its returns on investment of 12% per annum, PW3 would follow through with the withdrawals from the UOB Account[\[note: 187\]](#Ftn_187).

>> (ii)       PW3 told the AP that Zabel had to pay commissions to UOB Kay Hian for recommending the Heng Fai Enterprises share placement and that the potential returns for the share placement were 2 to 3 times the original investment.[\[note: 188\]](#Ftn_188)

> (f)     I found no basis and rejected the defence submissions that:

>> (i)       from the AP’s perspective as an employee of Zabel (which I have found earlier he is not a mere employee), PW3’s instructions to the AP to make the withdrawals signified that PW1 had done the necessary accounting and determined that the investments had exceeded 12% per annum and both PW3 and PW1 had discussed and decided that the monies withdrawn from the UOB Account were profits from the investments.

>> (ii)       there was no resource available to the AP to ascertain whether the withdrawn monies from the UOB Account comprised profits from Zabel’s investment or the capital from Zabel’s investors. As such, the AP could only rely on what was told to him by PW3.

>> (iii)       the AP did not know that Zabel had not achieved the returns at the material time, and the prosecution has not proved that the AP had access to sufficient details of Zabel’s trading activities such that he ought to have known that Zabel’s returns had not exceeded 12% per annum.

> (g)     Accordingly, I found that as AP had no basis to genuinely believe that he was legally entitled to perform the relevant transactions in respect of the payments referred to in the 3 charges preferred against him, he had acted dishonestly and intended to cause wrongful loss with respect to the monies that were withdrawn by him from his personal UOB account that comprised the capital from Zabel’s investors, and specifically, he knew that commissions could not be paid out from the money from Zabel’s investors at the material time.

> **_Issue (12): Whether the AP and PW1 were engaged in a conspiracy to misappropriate Zabel’s monies ?_**

> (a)     The statutory definition of “Criminal conspiracy” and the case authorities on what is a conspiracy and how it can be proved[\[note: 189\]](#Ftn_189) which I have considered earlier when I dismissed the defence application on no case to answer remain applicable to this issue.

> (b)     The AP and PW1 had conspired to dishonestly misappropriate these monies as they were not entitled to use these monies for anything but investment at the material time. It is not disputed that the persons who invested in Zabel’s funds were not charged management fees from April – June 2014[\[note: 190\]](#Ftn_190) and would only be charged performance fees if/when Zabel’s returns exceeded 12% per annum.[^191] Accordingly, investors’ monies could only be applied to Zabel’s expenses and payment of commissions if Zabel’s returns exceeded 12% per annum in the material period.

> (c)     However, Zabel’s returns did not exceed 12% per annum at any point in May and June 2014. In fact, Zabel’s investments incurred a net loss in the material period[\[note: 192\]](#Ftn_192). This is seen from PW3 ’s evidence – given that he had charge of Zabel’s investments in the material period, he is best-placed to speak on his. He testified that Zabel’s investments comprised only the trading of stocks and shares in the AP’s UOBKH trading account and the private placement of shares in Heng Fai Enterprises[^193], and that neither generated profit within the material period.[^194]

> (d)     PW3’s evidence is corroborated by the tabulation of the realised gains and losses from the trades in the AP’s UOBKH trading account from March to June 2014 in ASOF-25[\[note: 195\]](#Ftn_195) which showed clearly that there was a net loss over this period.

> (e)     The AP knew he was not entitled to use the monies in his personal UOB account to make payments to himself, PW1 and PW2 in May and June 2014 because he knew that Zabel only charged investors fees if/when its returns exceeded 12% per annum, and he also knew that Zabel had not achieved such returns at the material time. The first point is not disputed – the AP admitted to knowing, at the material time, that Zabel only charged its investors fees if/when it generated returns exceeding 12% per annum, as set out in the Notes of Evidence (NEs) below.[\[note: 196\]](#Ftn_196) This is also consistent with his statements to CAD.[^197]

>> NEs, Day 9 – Page 59:

>> Q:    So at that time in May, June 2014, you’re aware that Zabel can only pay you commissions if the returns exceeded a certain rate, correct?

>> A:    Yes, as per the fact sheet, yah.

>> Q:    Right. And as per the fact sheet, you knew that they can only pay you fees---performance fees if the returns exceeded 12% per annum, correct?

>> A:    That’s correct, yes.

> (f)     As regards the second point, the AP knew that Zabel’s returns had not exceeded 12% per annum at the material time. This is evident from his statements to CAD and PW1’s evidence as set out below.

> (g)     The AP had admitted to CAD that he had paid commissions to himself, PW1 and PW2 out of the monies in his UOB account in the _expectation_ that Zabel’s returns would exceed 12% per annum. He also denied having received any confirmation from PW3 that Zabel’s returns had exceeded 12% per annum. These are excerpted below \[emphasis added\]:

AP’s statement recorded on 9 Nov 2017 (Exhibit ASOF-22)

 |
| 

Q597

 | 

If the fund factsheets consistently stated 0% management fees, and the Zabel BVI could only earn profits when the profits from the fund was more than 12%, why were there commissions and reimbursements paid to Kim, Alice, you, Wei Siang and Jeff, as you elaborated earlier?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Wei Siang claimed that he had invested in certain equities that yield profits. And **he also said that the profits will definitely exceed 12%, so he told us that we are able to draw down the commissions**. This should be around April to May 2014.

This also explains why bulk of the monies were also withdrawn around May to June 2014.

 |
| 

Q598

 | 

I refer to your answer to Question 597. Did Wei Siang said that Zabel BVI has already achieved profits of more than 12%, or is he saying that Zabel BVI will achieve profits of more than 12%?

 |
| 

A

 | 

He said "will definitely achieve by the end of the month," referring to 31 May 2014.

 |
| 

Q599

 | 

**Can you confirm that there was no explicit statement from Wei Siang to say that the fund had achieved more than 12% profits during its period of operations**?

 |
| 

A

 | 

**No. He only said that it will yield more than 12% profits**.

 |
| 

Q600

 | 

If that is the case, why is Zabel BVI able to remunerate the three of you, namely Wei Siang, Jeff and you, and the marketing agents, Alice and Kim in advance?

 |
| 

A

 | 

**In expectations that there will be a surplus of profits more than 12% from 31 May 2014**.

 |
| 

**…**

 |
| 

Q602

 | 

Notwithstanding that there was no such agreement, should Zabel BVI have provided such remunerations without confirming that profits of more than 12% have been attained?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I believe it should not be the case.

 |
| 

Q603

 | 

Did you attempt to ask Wei Siang for the investment records confirming that the yield is more than 12%?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes, and I was given the response by him that **it will definitely yield more than 12%.**

 |

  
  

> (h)     I agreed with the prosecution that the AP’s claim in cross-examination that the above answers referred only to the period _prior_ to 31 May 2014[\[note: 198\]](#Ftn_198) should be rejected as a transparent attempt to cast doubt on these admissions. There was no reason for the AP to limit his answers as he claimed given that the questions posed did not state any particular time period. To the contrary, Q597 and Q600 expressly referred to the payments made to the AP, Jeff (PW1) and Alice (PW2). These had been made in May _and_ June 2014,[^199] and, in particular, the only payment to PW2 occurred in June 2014. These underscore that the AP was being questioned about the entire period of Zabel’s operations, and thus that his answers were not confined to the period before 31 May 2014.

> (i)     PW1’s testimony also corroborated the AP’s account in ASOF-22. PW1 said that he and the AP had used investors’ monies to make payments despite knowing that Zabel’s returns had not exceeded 12% per annum because PW3 assured them _in person_ that he _would_ achieve the necessary returns, as set out in the Notes of Evidence (NEs) below.[\[note: 200\]](#Ftn_200) PW1 also stated that he had never been told that Zabel’s funds had already generated returns.[^201]

>> NEs, Day 1 – Page 39:

>> Q:    Okay. So, Mr. Loh, if Zabel’s investors were not being charged any management fees---

>> A:    Yah.

>> Q:    and the performance fees would only be payable after Zabel had achieved the return of 12% per annum-

>> A:    Yah.

>> Q:    and you---you---as far as you knew at this point, 16th May 2014, Zabel had not reached 12% returns per annum-

>> A:    Yah.

>> Q:    why then were commissions being paid out of the investors’ monies?

>> A:    I mean, at that point in time, we didn’t really relate these commissions to the management fees, but basically, we---I mean, we actually, um, so-called asked Wei Siang and then during the discussion, he say that even with the 6% drawdown, he can actually make back the 20% or 25% or 30% return. Hence, **we will just---we assumed that he actually can make it, so we just actually gave the commission out from there as well.**

>> NEs, Day 1 – Page 40:

>> Q:    Alright. Mr. Loh, in your answer, you referred to “we asked Wei Siang and we assumed that Wei Siang can make-- can make it”, who is “we”?

>> A:    Uh, me and Mark.

>> Q:    Do you recall how this discussion between you, Wei Siang, and Mark Cheng took place? Was it in person?

>> A:    Uh, in person.

> (j)     The same account is set out in the Statement of Facts that PW1 had pleaded guilty to.[\[note: 202\]](#Ftn_202) Yet the defence did not challenge PW1 on this evidence at any point – another breach of the rule in _Browne v Dunn[^203]_ which goes to the _heart_ of the AP’s defence.

> (k)     In the light of the AP’s admissions and PW1’s evidence as set out above, I found that the AP knew he was not legally entitled to use the monies from Zabel’s investors to make payments to himself, PW1 and PW2. By making these payments, he clearly intended to cause wrongful loss to Zabel’s investors by depriving them of monies that should otherwise had been invested. He had therefore acted dishonestly in doing so.

> (l)     I agreed with the prosecution and rejected as afterthoughts the following claims made by the AP that he believed he could make the payments out of his personal UOB account to himself, PW1 and PW2 because of certain representations made to him by PW3 and/or PW1 about the source of the monies in his UOBKH trading account, where he claimed to have been told:

>> (i)       By PW3[\[note: 204\]](#Ftn_204) and PW1[^205] with regards to the payment to PW1 on 26 May 2014, that the UOBKH trading account contained “exceptional returns” generated from Prive’s investment activity;

>> (ii)       By PW3[\[note: 206\]](#Ftn_206) and PW1[^207] in relation to all payments, that his UOBKH trading account had generated returns from the trades therein; and that PW3 said in June 2014 that these “far exceeded” 12% per annum;[^208]

>> (iii)       By PW3 with regards to the payments in June 2014, that the Heng Fai Enterprises placement had generated realised profit of 300%.[\[note: 209\]](#Ftn_209)

> (m)     It is telling that the AP did not raise any of the above claims in any of his CAD statements despite having been expressly questioned on why commissions had been paid out of investors’ monies in Q597 and Q600, and further if he had ever received confirmation that Zabel’s returns exceeded 12% per annum in his CAD statement recorded on 9 Nov 2017 (Exhibit ASOF-22). The AP had confirmed that he gave multiple statements to CAD voluntarily, that they were accurately recorded, and that he made amendments to them as he wished.[\[note: 210\]](#Ftn_210) I agreed with the prosecution that these was simply no reason for the AP to omit these exculpatory claims from his statements if they were true.

> (n)     The AP’s above claims that with regards to the payment to PW1 on 26 May 2014 that the UOBKH trading account contained “exceptional returns” generated from Prive’s investment activity, and that in relation to all payments, his UOBKH trading account had generated returns from the trades therein that “far exceeded” 12% per annum arose at an extremely belated stage, during the AP’s examination in chief. As submitted by the prosecution, they were neither set out in the Case for the Defence **(“**CFD**”**) (Exhibit PE7) nor put to PW1 or PW3 in cross examination. The omission of these claims from the CFD is conspicuous. Given that the CFD sets out the purported representation by PW3 concerning the returns from the Heng Fai Enterprises placement,[\[note: 211\]](#Ftn_211) the defence must have appreciated the significance of such representations to the AP’s defence. There is no reason for the defence to deliberately leave the other two claims out of the CFD. Pursuant to section 169(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010, I drew the inference from the aforesaid omissions that the AP invented these claims during his trial, as submitted by the prosecution.

> (o)     As for the defence failure to put the above claims to PW1 and/or PW3, these are again violations of the rule in _Browne v Dunn__[\[note: 212\]](#Ftn_212)_. In particular, the defence failed to contradict PW1’s evidence that Prive’s investments had not generated returns at the point that CAD commenced investigations in July 2014.[^213] The evidence of PW1 on these aspects should thus be accepted in full.

> (p)     I also rejected the AP’s claim that PW3 told him the Heng Fai Enterprises placement had generated 300% profit for the following reasons, as submitted by the prosecution:

>> (i)       Both PW1[\[note: 214\]](#Ftn_214) and PW3[^215] denied the existence of such a representation. PW1 has no reason to deny this if it were true, as it would have exculpated him of his charges for conspiring with the AP to dishonestly misappropriate Zabel’s monies.[^216]

>> (ii)       The AP’s claim that PW3 told him the placement would and had yielded profits of 300% by June 2016[\[note: 217\]](#Ftn_217) is contradicted by other documentary evidence showing that PW3 had represented the indicative returns to be much more modest, and to be paid yearly. The emails that PW3 sent to the AP and others to introduce the Heng Fai Enterprises placement stated that it would produce about 8 – 10% returns per _annum_; even taking into account a discount on the share price which PW3 claimed would be given, the returns would be about 20%.[^218] PW1’s evidence corroborated this – he said that PW3 told him and the AP that the returns on this placement would be about 20-25% after one year.[^219]

>> (iii)       Even if the AP had been told that the Heng Fai Enterprises placement generated 300% returns, he would never have believed it. This meant that the placement had paid out _9.375 million_ of returns in less than four weeks.[\[note: 220\]](#Ftn_220) This defied belief. The AP also has no explanation for failing to verify these purported returns – it would have been as simple as sighting a bank statement seeing as it was supposedly realised profit. That he did not do so underscores the incredible nature of this claim.

>> (iv)       As between the evidence of PW1 and that of the AP, I found that not only is PW1 a credible witness, his evidence is also materially corroborated by the AP’s statements to CAD, the evidence of the other credible prosecution witnesses, as well as the contemporaneous documents. In contrast, the AP’s evidence comprises belated afterthoughts and incredible assertions.

> (q)     I rejected the defence submissions and reiterate my earlier decision when I dismissed the defence submission on no case to answer that as “conspiracy”, “dishonestly” and “misappropriation” are legal concepts, PW1’s denial in his oral evidence that there was “_a secret agreement \[between him and the AP\] to act dishonestly by taking away money from the investors_”[\[note: 221\]](#Ftn_221) should be disregarded since, as admitted by the defence, PW1’s aforesaid oral evidence is inconsistent with his position as seen in the court documents relating to his previous convictions in DAC-930907-2019, and DAC-930908-2019 and DAC-930909-2019, both of which had been taken into consideration for purposes of sentencing and the said charges correspond to the s 406 charges faced by the AP. PW3 had also denied that PW1 and the AP planned to “_siphon off money belonging to Zabel’s investor \[sic\] for their own benefit”._[^222] I agreed with the prosecution that whether PW1 and the AP had conspired to dishonestly misappropriate Zabel’s money is a legal question which neither PW1 nor PW3 can answer as laypeople as they can only attest to the facts and their respective evidence on this legal question throws no reasonable doubt as to whether there had been an agreement between PW1 and the AP to commit CBT, as contended by the defence.

> (r)     Contrary to the defence submissions, the case authorities cited by the parties held that the essence of a conspiracy is agreement, and what is required and has been adduced in evidence at the trial is that the words and actions of the parties, namely the AP and PW1, indicated their agreement and concert in the pursuit of a common object or design, giving rise to an inexorable and irresistible inference that their actions must have been co-ordinated by arrangement beforehand and accounts for all the facts of the case. In addition, dishonesty under s 24 PC does not require proof of personal gain, yet the defence repeatedly questioned PW3 on whether the AP acted for his “own benefit” or “own personal gain” in making the requisite payments.[\[note: 223\]](#Ftn_223)

> (s)     I agreed with the prosecution that the AP’s attempt to explain away his admission to CAD in ASOF-22, that he took PW3’s alleged instructions to make the payments as implicit confirmation that Zabel had made the necessary returns, is unbelievable. His purported belief does not appear anywhere in ASOF-22 even though the AP had been expressly asked _why_ commissions had been paid out, and whether he had received confirmation that Zabel had achieved the relevant returns.[\[note: 224\]](#Ftn_224) To the contrary, the AP had expressly stated that Zabel could make payments to him, PW1 and PW2 “in **expectations** that there **will be** a surplus of profits more than 12% from 31 May 2014” (emphasis added).[^225] If the AP genuinely believed that Zabel _had_ achieved the necessary returns at the time he made the payments to himself, PW1 and PW2, he would have told CAD this in so many words. After all, he conceded in the same statement that they ought not to have made these payments unless it had been confirmed that Zabel had exceeded the necessary rate of return.[^226] His attempt to cast his answers in ASOF-22 in a different light now is obviously self-serving. In any event, the AP’s answers in ASOF-22 are also corroborated by PW1’s evidence that he and the AP had used investors’ monies to make payments despite knowing that Zabel’s returns had not exceeded 12% per annum because PW3 assured them _in person_ that he _would_ achieve the necessary returns.[^227]

> (t)     As submitted by the prosecution, the defence argument that PW3 may have told PW1 and the AP different things about the returns Zabel had made from the Heng Fai Enterprises placement is implausible. PW1 maintained that Zabel did not achieve the necessary rate of return when the payments to himself, PW2 and the AP were made, and he was convicted and sentenced for his role in the same. There is no reason for any asymmetry of information between PW1 and the AP regarding the source of these monies given that payments were made to both. Given the defence claim that PW1 was the AP’s boss, one may even expect PW1 to have _more_ information than the AP given his purportedly higher status in Zabel. The only explanation for this discrepancy is that PW1 told the truth, and the AP’s defence is a desperate fiction invented to absolve himself of liability.

> (u)     As I have found under Issues (9) and (11) above, there is simply no basis for the AP to genuinely believe that the monies in his personal UOB account comprised profits from Zabel’s investments and that he had only paid out the commissions to PW1, PW2 and himself after receiving assurance and confirmation by PW3 that Zabel’s returns had exceeded 12% per annum.

> (v)     For the above reasons, I found that the AP and PW1 were engaged in a conspiracy to misappropriate Zabel’s monies.

> **_Issue (13): Whether the rule in Browne v Dunn requires the defence to put its case to the prosecution witnesses on points or issues material to the defence since the prosecution witnesses had testified first ?_**

> (a)     The rule in _Browne v Dunn_ which evidently, the function of which is to give both the witness, as well as the party calling said witness, notice of the cross-examiner’s case, requires that “any matter upon which it is proposed to contradict the evidence-in-chief given by the witness must normally be put to him so that he may have an opportunity of explaining the contradiction, and failure to do this may be held to imply acceptance of the evidence-in-chief”. The rationale for this rule was that:

>> (i)       “It gives the witness the opportunity to deny the challenge on oath, to show his mettle under attack”;

>> (ii)       It also “gives the witness opportunity both to explain or to qualify his own evidence in the light of the contradiction of which warning has been given and also, if he can, to explain or to qualify the other evidence upon which the challenge is to be based”; and

>> (iii)       “more significantly, it gives the party calling the witness the opportunity to call corroborative evidence which in the absence of such a challenge is unlikely to have been called”.[\[note: 228\]](#Ftn_228)

> (b)     One exception to the rule in _Browne v Dunn_ is that where the witness has been given full notice as to the intention on the part of the cross-examiner to impeach (or challenge) his version of events, the witness need not, strictly speaking, be confronted in relation to the cross-examiner’s position on the matter. This appears to be illustrated by the case of _Awtar Singh s/o Margar Singh v PP_ _<span class="citation">\[2000\] 2 SLR(R) 435</span>_ where the appellant had been convicted of eight charges of abetment through intentionally aiding another individual to harbour eight immigration offenders. The said immigration offenders had given testimony, _inter alia_, that, they had seen the appellant in the premises in question on a number of occasions and that some of them even knew him as the owner of the said premises. The appellant’s position was that he did not see the immigration offenders during his visits to the premises. The appellant was convicted, and one of the grounds of appeal was that the rule in _Browne v Dunn_ had been contravened because the accused was not confronted on the prosecution’s contention that he must have seen the immigration offenders during his visit to the premises. Rejecting such a contention on the premise that the appellant must surely have been put on notice that the prosecution’s case was that the appellant must have seen the immigration offenders during such visits, the High Court opined (at \[44\]) as follows:

>> “… I did not find it strictly necessary for the Prosecution to put to the appellant that he saw the immigration offenders during his visits. **It was apparent to the appellant what the Prosecution’s case was** and it was that the immigration offenders saw him at the premises collecting rent and performing various other tasks pertaining to the upkeep of the premises. **His defence was a complete denial that he had ever seen these immigration offenders**. That being the case, in my view, **it could not be said that the failure to put the question to the appellant resulted in any procedural unfairness to him, in the sense that he had been deprived of an opportunity to explain his evidence which would amount to nothing more than another denial that he had not seen them before**… (Emphasis added).

> (c)     Applying the above legal principles to the present case, I accepted the prosecution submissions that:

>> (i)       the rule in _Browne v Dunn_ requires the defence to put its case to the prosecution witnesses on points or issues material to the defence case since the prosecution witnesses had testified first.

>> (ii)       the defence failed to contradict the prosecution witnesses on the following points or issues material to the defence:

>> In relation to the s 82(3) r/w s 331(1) SFA charge

>> The defence did not contradict PW1’s evidence on the various decisions which he said he, the AP and PW3 had made collectively. The defence did not contradict PW1’s evidence that the AP hired salespeople for Zabel without seeking approval from either PW1 or PW3; that these salespeople reported to the AP, not PW1 or PW3; and further that the AP signed the contract notes of investors because it concerned sales, which he was in charge of.

>> In relation to the s 406 r/w s 109 PC charges:

>> The defence did not contradict PW1’s evidence that he and the AP had made payments out of the AP’s UOB account because PW3 told them in person that he could make the necessary returns and they assumed he would. The defence did not put to PW1 or PW3 that they told the AP that the UOBKH trading account contained returns from Prive’s investment; or that they told the AP that the monies in his UOB account came from “investment profits”.

>> (iii)       the defence has proffered no explanation for the above omissions. This is telling of the fact that the defence has no explanations, and these were clearly afterthoughts invented by the AP on the stand. The only response the defence has mustered is that the AP’s position in relation to his role in Zabel did not take the prosecution by surprise. This is firstly untrue – the AP first claimed that he did not decide to engage Zabel’s salespersons and that they did not report to him in his examination-in-chief, an extremely belated stage. Even if this assertion that the prosecution was not taken by surprise were true, it does not answer the animating rationale behind the rule in _Browne v Dunn_ – that the witness be given the opportunity to respond to these allegations. This argument thus failed to explain why the defence ought not to be taken to have accepted the evidence of the prosecution witnesses given their omission to contradict them.

>> (v)       the defence argument that the prosecution violated the rule in _Browne v Dunn_6 is patently without merit. As submitted by the prosecution, the Notes of Evidence show that every fact underlying the prosecution case, including PW1’s evidence, had been put to the AP for his answer during cross-examination.[\[note: 229\]](#Ftn_229) The _only_ point that the defence asserted had not been put to the AP concerned not a fact but rather an argument concerning the logical coherence of the AP’s explanation for now seeking to resile from his statement to CAD in ASOF-22 as regards the defence submission that AP’s answers in his CAD statement referred only to the period prior to 31 May 2014 which the prosecution had shown to be incorrect as his answers were not confined to the period prior to 31 May 2014 and which plainly does not come within the rule in _Browne v Dunn_. This defence submission is a futile attempt to cast out an argument that the defence is unable to address substantively.

> (d)     In this regard, I rejected the defence submissions that :

>> (i)       the rule in _Browne v Dunn_ does not require the defence to put its case to the prosecution witnesses on the disputed points or issues material to the defence since the prosecution witnesses had testified first. In my view, the Case for the Defence (CFD) merely asserts the AP’s version of events which the defence must put to the prosecution witnesses for them to respond and explain, first for the court’s overall assessment of the evidence of all the prosecution witnesses and that of the AP and his witness, and then for the court’s determination on the issues arising from the trial. It cannot be taken as plain and obvious position to the prosecution witnesses of the defence case without the defence putting its case to them, as contended by the defence. I found that the defence case is not apparent to the prosecution witnesses and the AP’s evidence and position that he had taken instructions from PW1 and/or PW3 on various matters and did not make the decisions on matters relating to the recruitment of sales agents or had the sales agents report to him for matters not relating to administrative matters were not specifically put to the prosecution witnesses at the trial, particularly PW1, for their response and explanation.[\[note: 230\]](#Ftn_230)

>> (ii)       the above exception to the rule in _Browne v Dunn_ and the factual matrix in _Awtar Singh s/o Margar Singh v PP_ (which applied the exception when the High Court held that it was not strictly necessary for the prosecution to put to the appellant that he saw the immigration offenders during his visits as it was apparent to the appellant what the prosecution’s case was and it was that the immigration offenders saw him at the premises collecting rent and performing various other tasks pertaining to the upkeep of the premises, and the defence was one of complete denial) is applicable here as that case is clearly different from the present case where the defence case is not apparent to the prosecution witnesses who must be given an opportunity to specifically respond to the AP’s version of the events. Contrary to the defence submissions, PW1 and PW3 had not been given full notice that the AP disputed their evidence in relation to the points or issues material to the defence and both PW1 and PW3 can be said to have been taken by surprise by the AP’s stand on these issues. I found that there was procedural unfairness on the part of the defence in breach of the rule in _Browne v Dunn._

>> (iii)       if the AP’s evidence had contradicted PW1’s evidence, the onus would have been on the prosecution to cross-examine the AP on the discrepancies or differences in the evidence given by the AP and PW1 on the AP’s role in Zabel on matters relating to the recruitment of salespersons and to whom they report to for administrative matters or otherwise.

> (e)     Accordingly, I found that that the defence has breached the rule in _Browne v Dunn_ and accepted the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, specifically PW1 and PW3, on the issues of : (i) whether the AP played a part in managing Zabel and in deciding to hold Zabel’s monies in a UOB account in the AP’s name; on the fees to charge to investors; and how much Zabel ought to invest in the Heng Fai Enterprises placement; (ii) whether PW1 was one of the AP’s bosses and was a person who held executive authority in Zabel; (iii) who engaged the sales representatives; (iv) who the salespersons or representatives reported to; (v) why the AP signed the contract notes of investors; (vi) whether the AP knew that he was not authorized to use the monies in his UOB account to make payments to himself, PW1 and PW2; (vii) whether PW1 himself told the AP that the monies in the AP’s personal UOB account came from investment profits; and (viii) whether PW1 and PW3 told the AP that the monies in his UOB trading account contained profits from Prive’s investments.

> **_Issue (14)(a): What is the AP’s defence to each of the charges preferred against him, and has the AP raised a reasonable doubt in the prosecution’s case, and why?_**

> **_Issue (14)(b): Whether the prosecution has established its case against the AP beyond a reasonable doubt, and why?_**

> (a)     It is trite that all that the principle of reasonable doubt requires is that upon a consideration of all the evidence presented by the prosecution and/or the defence, the evidence must be sufficient to establish each and every element of the offence for which the accused is charged beyond reasonable doubt. The doctrine of beyond reasonable doubt, mandated that, at the very least, those doubts for which there was a reason that was, in turn, relatable to and supported by the evidence presented, had to be excluded. Reasonable doubt could also arise by virtue of lack of evidence submitted, when such evidence was necessary to support the prosecution’s theory of guilt. A trial judge had to apply his mind to the evidence, to carefully sift and reason through the evidence to ensure and affirm that his finding of guilt or innocence was grounded entirely in logic and fact.[\[note: 231\]](#Ftn_231)

> (b)     In the light of my determinations on Issues (1) to (13) above, I rejected the defence submissions and found that, on the totality of the evidence in respect of the SFA charge in DAC-930902-2019, the defence has not raised any reasonable doubt as to whether the AP has purported to act as a manager and thus as an officer of Zabel and whether he had consented to Zabel carrying on a regulated activity without a CMS licence while acting as an officer of Zabel. Upon my consideration of all the evidence presented by both parties, I found that contrary to the defence submissions, the AP’s involvement in Zabel was not restricted to that of an ordinary employee or a mere introducer of salespersons or relationship managers to Zabel (despite undisputed evidence that the AP was neither a shareholder nor a director of Zabel and that the AP was not appointed as a member of the board of directors of Zabel as well as PW4’s evidence on him as a runner and not part of Zabel’s management and the AP’s lack of academic and financial qualifications) as he has purported to act in the capacity of a manager and thus as an officer of Zabel in charge of sales and did not need to seek approval from ether PW1 and/or PW3, and he had hired salespeople for Zabel like PW2 and Tan Kim Lin without seeking approval from either PW1 or PW2[\[note: 232\]](#Ftn_232) and the salespeople also reported to him and not to PW1 or PW2.[^233] Contrary to the defence contention, I had found, based on the law and evidence under Issue (5), that the prosecution has proved that the AP knew that Zabel was carrying on a business in fund management; knew that Zabel was doing so without a CMS licence; and consented to Zabel carrying on a regulated business in fund management without a CMS licence.

> (c)     In the light of my determinations on Issues (1) to (13) above, I rejected the defence submissions and found that, on the totality of the evidence in respect of the three s 406 charges in DACs 930903-5 of 2019, the defence has not raised any reasonable doubt as to the AP’s guilt as the evidence adduced at the trial clearly showed that:

>> (i)       contrary to the defence submissions that the AP was not entrusted with the various sums of monies stated in the s 406 charges and had no proprietary rights to the monies in his personal UOB account and was in no position to deal with the monies therein without the approval or instruction of PW1 or PW3, the Zabel’s monies in the AP’s UOBKH trading account belonged to Zabel’s investors[\[note: 234\]](#Ftn_234), and the monies in the AP’s UOBKH trading account had first to be transferred to his personal UOB account before they could be withdrawn or otherwise used.[^235] As the account-holder, the AP was the only person able to access and withdraw monies from his personal UOB account.[^236] He thus plainly had possession of the monies therein, and had therefore been entrusted with the monies of Zabel’s investors.

>> (ii)       the prosecution had established the _mens rea_ of the offence for CBT, i.e., that the AP had acted dishonestly and had no basis to genuinely believe that the monies withdrawn from his personal UOB account comprised profits which PW3 had instructed him to release from the UOB account.

>> (iii)       the AP knew he was not entitled to use the monies in his personal UOB account to make payments to himself, PW1 and PW2 in May and June 2014 because he knew that Zabel only charged investors fees if/when its returns exceeded 12% per annum and he also knew that Zabel had not achieved such returns at the material time. The AP had admitted to knowing, at the material time, that Zabel only charged its investors fees if/when it generated returns exceeding 12% per annum.[\[note: 237\]](#Ftn_237) This is also consistent with his statements to CAD[^238] where he admitted to CAD that he had paid commissions to himself, PW1 and PW2 out of the monies in his personal UOB account in the expectation that Zabel’s returns would exceed 12% per annum. He also stated in his statement that there was no explicit statement from PW3 to say that the fund had achieved more than 12% profits during its period of operations as PW3 only said that it will yield more than 12% profits[^239]. Hence, there is no basis for the defence submission that there was no way that the AP could have ascertained whether Zabel’s returns on investments had exceeded 12% per annum, and that there was no resource available to the AP to ascertain whether the withdrawn monies comprised profits from Zabel’s investment or the capital from Zabel’s investors.

> (d)     Under Issue (12) above, I have rejected as afterthoughts, the AP’s claim that PW3 had represented to the AP that the monies in the UOB Account were consolidated and comingled with the monies from Prive Investments and the payment of $50, 500 to PW1 came from the Prive returns, as this claim was not raised by the AP in any of his statements despite having given multiple statements to CAD voluntarily, confirmed that they were accurately recorded, and that he made amendments to them as he wished[\[note: 240\]](#Ftn_240), and there was therefore simply no reason for him to omit these exculpatory claims from his statements if they were true. This AP’s claim was also not set out in the Case for the Defence (“CFD”) (Exhibit PE7) nor put to PW1 or PW3 in cross-examination. There was no basis for the AP to believe that PW3 had given instructions to the AP to make the withdrawals and this meant that PW1 had done the necessary account and determined that the investments had exceeded 12% per annum and that both PW3 and PW1 had discussed and decided that the monies withdrawn were profits from the investments.

> (e)     Under Issue (1) above, I have found that PW1’s denial in his oral evidence that there was “a secret agreement \[between him and the AP\] to act dishonestly by taking away money from the investors” should be disregarded since, as admitted by the defence, PW1’s aforesaid oral evidence is inconsistent with his position as seen in the court documents relating to his previous convictions in DAC-930907-2019, and DAC-930908-2019 and DAC-930909-2019, both of which had been taken into consideration for purposes of sentencing and the said charges correspond to the s 406 charges faced by the AP. Further, whether PW1 and the AP had engaged in a conspiracy to dishonestly misappropriate Zabel’s money is a legal question which PW1 cannot answer as a layperson who can only attest to the facts.

## CONCLUSION FOR THE TRIAL

6       Having applied my mind to the all the evidence presented by both parties, carefully sifted and reasoned through the evidence, I was satisfied that a finding of the AP’s guilt was grounded entirely in logic and fact. My determinations on Issues (1) to (14) above were made after my consideration and weighing of the merits of each party’s arguments made in their respective submissions. It was clear to me that the AP has no defence and that the prosecution has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt in respect of the 4 charges in DAC-930902-2019 and DACs 930903-5 of 2019 which have been preferred against the AP. Accordingly, I found the AP guilty and convicted him of the aforesaid charges.

## SENTENCING CONSIDERATIONS & FRAMEWORK AND INDIVIDUAL AND GLOBAL SENTENCES

### Issue (15)(a): What are the sentencing considerations and framework as well as the aggravating and mitigating factors to be taken into account by the court in sentencing the AP for each of the charges preferred against him ?

### Issue (15)(b): What is the appropriate sentence to be imposed on the AP for each of the proceeded charges and also the global sentence, and why?

### Mitigating factors

7       I accepted the following mitigating factors as submitted by the defence. The AP was only 26 years old at the time he was employed by Zabel. He did not continue his studies after completing his A-levels due to his family circumstances. He had worked with his parents in their printing company after leaving school. He saw the employment at Zabel as an opportunity for him to learn more about financial investment. The AP had shown remorse as he had made restitution[\[note: 241\]](#Ftn_241) of $57,750 to the investors[^242]. Moreover, this is the first offence[^243] that the AP faces. It is important to note that eight (8) years have elapsed since the discovery of the offences in 2014. Further, the AP was cooperative during the investigation process. The AP has made rehabilitative progress since 2014. Presently, he is making a decent living doing odd jobs such as working as a delivery driver. The AP is also employed by a printing company where he holds a sales role.

### No inordinate delay in prosecution causing prejudice to the AP

8       I accepted the prosecution submission and rejected the defence submission[\[note: 244\]](#Ftn_244) that there was an “inordinate delay in prosecution” which caused prejudice to the AP. While the AP was charged in 2019 about five years after investigations began in 2014, it is not the case that any delay in a prosecution will warrant a reduction in sentence: this must first be shown to be a delay “well beyond the sort of time scale that is typically encountered in broadly similar cases”. This in turn turns on the “factual and evidential complexity of the matter, the gravity of the offence, the number of witnesses, the extent to which the accused person is forthcoming, the number of accused persons”.[^245]

9       I rejected the defence submission and agreed with the prosecution that there was no inordinate delay in the present case given the factual complexity of the matter. The investigations concerned three accused persons (the AP, PW1 and PW3) and the operations of two companies (Prive and Zabel), both of which had solicited substantial investments from multiple investors, many of whom were resident overseas.[\[note: 246\]](#Ftn_246) There was also a need to establish the purposes to which the investors’ monies were applied, which involved funds tracing for multiple accounts.

10     Contrary to the defence submission, I found no inordinate delay between the commission of the offences and the ultimate disposition of these offences via the criminal justice process which might warrant a sentence that might otherwise be viewed as "a quite undue degree of leniency". There was also no evidence adduced by the defence of any prejudice suffered by the AP with undue agony, suspense and uncertainty inflicted on him.

### Sentence for the SFA charge in DAC-930902-2019

11     I accepted the following sentencing considerations for the SFA offence as submitted by the prosecution:

> (a)     A sound and progressive financial services sector is integral to the success and resilience of the Singapore economy. People will only transact in the financial markets to invest and to raise capital if they have confidence in the financial system. There is therefore a need to promote transparency and fair-dealing by those operating in the financial services sector. The licensing of regulated activities is a means by which Singapore seeks to achieve this objective. Licensing allows the MAS to safeguard investors’ interests and preserve confidence in the system. A licensing regime also gives MAS the legal powers to take supervisory and enforcement actions against those that compromise these objectives. A clear signal must be sent to those who intend to engage in business in regulated activities that they must comply with the necessary criteria and obtain the requisite licences. Only then may the objectives of protecting the public and promoting confidence in the financial sector be achieved.

> (b)     As submitted by the prosecution, the sentencing considerations for this CMS licence charge which bear on the potential harm of this offence are as follows[\[note: 247\]](#Ftn_247):

>> (i)       Zabel received a substantial sum of $8,397,762 of investments into its fund management business, from about 20 investors.

>> (ii)       Whilst CAD’s swift action in this case resulted in the preservation of the bulk of investors’ capital, a loss of at least $151,677 accrued from the monies paid out to PW2 that were not returned.

>> (iii)       The period that Zabel carried on the business of fund management without a CMS licence with the AP’s consent is about three months.

>> (iv)       Zabel’s operations were relatively organised, as seen from its engagement of multiple sales representatives to reach out to investors and the processes and paperwork devised by the AP, PW1 and PW3.

> (c)     I agreed with the prosecution submission that at least 2 months’ imprisonment should be imposed for the SFA charge in DAC-930902-2019 in the present case based on my consideration and calibration of the following sentencing precedents cited by both parties (which I found instructive, but I am mindful that no two cases can or will ever be completely identical or symmetrical as sentencing is neither a science nor an administrative exercise and sentences cannot be determined with mathematical certainty nor should they be arbitrary, but the sentence must fit the crime[\[note: 248\]](#Ftn_248)) as well as the mitigating factors cited by the defence which I have earlier accepted (emphasis in bold below mine):

>> (i)        _PP v Nancy Tan Mee Khim_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 230</span> (MA 9423/2020)[^249] concerned the managing director of a company which solicited over $15 million of investments into securities without a CMS licence. About $9.5 million of losses were accrued by over 100 persons because of the company’s activities. **The offender was sentenced to 8 months’ imprisonment**. This case is undeniably more egregious given the losses involved as CAD’s swift action in the present case resulted in the preservation of the bulk of investors’ capital with a loss of at least $151,677 accrued from the monies paid out to PW2 that were not returned.

>> (ii)       The present case is undoubtedly more serious than _PP v Lee Chang Yeh Bentley_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 329</span> (MA 345/2017)[^250] where the offender who collected $872,752 from three persons as investments into two funds which he managed solely without a CMS licence. **There was no evidence of loss to the investors. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a fine of $50,000 (i/d 2 months’ imprisonment).** However, Zabel collected a sum of $8,397,762 which is ten times greater than the sum collected from the investors in _Lee Chang Yeh Bentley._ There was a loss of at least $151,677 accrued from the monies paid out to PW2 that were not returned in the present case, while there was no loss in _Lee Chang Yeh Bentley._ Zabel involved a greater extent of organisation given the number of persons (including the AP who is in charge of Zabel’s sales) involved in its sales and marketing efforts and concerned a larger-scale business handling vast sums of money which carried far more significant potential harm than that in _Lee Chang Yeh Bentley_. In addition, the AP claimed trial. A heavier sentence is therefore called for in the present case as a fine of $50,000 (i/d 2 months’ imprisonment imposed on the offender in _Lee Chang Yeh Bentley_ is wholly inappropriate for the AP as sought by the defence in the present case.

>> (iii)       The case of _PP v Tan Sock Kuan__[\[note: 251\]](#Ftn_251)_ involved an offender who ran a fund management business for over two years without a CMS licence – she had a full-time employee who assisted only in administrative tasks. The charge concerned her collection of just under $12 million from six investors. **Each suffered loss but the quantum could not be ascertained because the offender did not keep detailed records of the payments she made to them. She pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 4 months’ imprisonment.** In the present case, the AP had claimed trial and while the span of offending is shorter, the business was more organised than that of _Tan Sock Kuan_ and there was a loss of at least $151,677 accrued from the monies paid out to PW2 that were not returned in the present case. All considered, a shorter sentence of less than 4 months’ imprisonment will be appropriate in the present case.

>> (iv)       In _PP v Ng Ngah Hiong_[\[note: 252\]](#Ftn_252) where **the offender pleaded guilty** and was convicted under s 82 SFA and **sentenced to 4 months’ imprisonment** for running a fund management business, by seeking investments from mostly friends (and friends of those friends) for him to trade in stock options. In total, he collected $2,472,740 from 35 investors. **The amount owing to the investors was about $500,000.** In my view, this case is far more egregious than the present case where the loss of $500,000 is far more than the loss of at least $151,677 accrued from the monies paid out to PW2 that were not returned in the present case even though the AP claimed trial and Zabel received a more substantial sum of $8,397,762 of investments into its fund management business from about 20 investors. A shorter sentence of less than 4 months’ imprisonment will therefore be appropriate in the present case.

> (d)     Accordingly, I rejected the defence submission for a fine of $50,000 and **imposed a sentence of 2 months’ imprisonment on the AP for the SFA charge in DAC-930902-2019** in the present case, as sought by the prosecution.

### Sentences for the 3 s 406 charges in DACs 930903-5 of 2019

12     The following sentencing precedents concerning first-time offenders convicted of offences under s 406 PC were cited by the parties (emphasis in bold below mine):

> (i)     In _PP v Tan Lay Yen_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 5</span> (MA 9001/2017),[^253] the offender misappropriated two cheques amounting to **$53,502** belonging to her employer. She made full restitution, pleaded guilty, and was **sentenced to six months’ imprisonment.**

> (ii)     The offender in _PP v Prem Hirubalan_ _<span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 156</span>_[^254] was a securities dealer who misappropriated **$54,000** belonging to one client by depositing the sum into another client’s account in order to cover up trading losses eventuated from trades he executed without authorisation. Full restitution was made during the internal investigations carried out by his employer. He was charged about four years after he returned to Singapore from his studies abroad and pleaded guilty to the charges against him. The appellate court considered that 6 months’ imprisonment was warranted for the s 406 PC charge. **The court however imposed 4 months’ imprisonment finally to take into account that the offender was under the impression that he could put this incident behind him until his arrest.**

> (iii)     In _PP v Ng Ah Ghoon_ _<span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 184</span>_, the offender pleaded guilty to seven CBT charges under s 406 PC **with no restitution** and was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment for amount of $81,000; **6 months imprisonment for amount of $30,000**; 9 months imprisonment for amount of $45,000; and 10 months imprisonment for amount of $61,000.

> (iv)     In _PP v Raj Kumar s/o Brisa Besnath_ _<span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 57</span>_, the offender claimed trial to a charge of CBT under s 406 PC with no restitution and was **sentenced to 13 months imprisonment for amount of $81,000.**

> (v)     In _PP v Rahmat bin Mohamed Amin_[\[note: 255\]](#Ftn_255), the offender pleaded guilty to 1 charge of CBT under s 406 PC and was **sentenced to 3 years’ imprisonment for amount of $289,884.**

13     Based on my consideration and calibration of the above sentencing precedents cited by both the parties (which I found instructive, but I am mindful that no two cases can or will ever be completely identical or symmetrical as sentencing is neither a science nor an administrative exercise and sentences cannot be determined with mathematical certainty nor should they be arbitrary, but the sentence must fit the crime[\[note: 256\]](#Ftn_256)) as well as the mitigating factors cited by the defence which I have earlier accepted and the sentencing considerations below, I took the view that the following sentences of imprisonment should be imposed on the AP for each of the three s 406 charges in DACs 930903-5 of 2019 in the present case:

> (b)     The above sentencing precedents indicate a sentencing range of 12 to 36 months (3 years) for amounts between $81,000 to $289,884 and I noted that the facts in those sentencing precedents and the present case are not largely analogous. For the charge in DAC-930903-2019 involving the $133,500 paid to PW1, PW1 was sentenced to 10 months’ imprisonment for this charge after pleading guilty. I took the view that **a sentence of 11 months’ imprisonment would be warranted for the AP** who had claimed trial and would not be entitled to any sentencing discount that PW1 received for pleading guilty and he therefore ought to receive a higher sentence than PW1. However, in calibrating the extent of the uplift, I took into account the fact that the AP did not stand to gain directly from the sum of $133,500 which was received by PW1 solely, as well as the above mitigating factors.

> (c)     In this regard, I also took into account the sentencing considerations as submitted by the defence that :

>> (i)       the mere fact of claiming trial is not an aggravating factor. There may be no additional aggravating factors if the accused does not necessarily prolong his trial. On the other hand, an accused who pleads guilty may usually expect a “discount” in sentence, relative to the sentence which may be imposed on an accused who elects to claim trial. There is no rigid rule in sentencing which indicates that a “discount” should invariably be ordered in every case. The circumstances of each case have to be considered.[\[note: 257\]](#Ftn_257)

>> (ii)       While the parity principle states that the sentences imposed on the offenders engaged in the same offence or the same criminal enterprise should, generally speaking, be the same, relevant differences in the offenders’ respective degrees of responsibility and/or respective personal circumstances must be accounted for.[\[note: 258\]](#Ftn_258)

> (d)     In the light of my findings under Issues (1) to (13) above, I rejected the defence sentencing submissions that the degree of culpability between PW1 and the AP is distinct as at all material times, the AP took instructions from PW1 and PW3 or was misled by the duo, and that as stated by the AP himself, if he had known that Zabel did not have the requisite CMS licence to conduct fund management activities, or that the monies in the UOB account belonged to Zabel’s investors, the AP would not have gone along with the scheme or carried out the transactions.

> (e)     The above sentencing precedents concerning first-time offenders convicted of offences under s 406 PC indicate a **sentencing range of 4 to 6 months for amounts between $30,000 to $54,000** and I noted that the facts in those sentencing precedents and the present case are not largely analogous. As for the charge involving the payment of $37,875 to the AP in DAC-930904-2019, I took the view that in the light of the above mitigating factors, **a sentence of 4 months imprisonment, as submitted by the defence, will be appropriate for this charge**. In this regard, I took into account the defence submission that the court must also consider other factors such as the level of trust reposed on the offender, the duration of the offence, and the use to which the money taken was put to, and balance these factors with any mitigating circumstances.[\[note: 259\]](#Ftn_259) I accepted that the degree and level of trust reposed on the AP is not as significant as the offender in _PP v Tan Lay Yen_ as the AP did not procure any investors to invest in Zabel as all investors were procured by Tan Kim Lin or PW2 and the AP had made restitution of $57,750 to the investors.

> (f)     The above sentencing precedents indicate a sentencing range of 12 to 36 months (3 years) for amounts between $81,000 to $289,884 and I noted that the facts in those sentencing precedents and the present case are not largely analogous. In relation to the charge of $151,677 paid to PW2 in DAC-930905-2019, I took the view that as the AP who had claimed trial did not receive any direct pecuniary benefit from the sum of $151,677 paid to PW2 and in the light of the above mitigating factors, **a sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment would be warranted for the AP** as these monies were not returned and represented an unmitigated loss to Zabel’s investors.

### Global sentence imposed on the AP

14     In _Muhammad Sutarno bin Nasir v PP_ _<span class="citation">\[2018\] SGCA 43</span>_, the Court of Appeal laid down the following legal principles governing consecutive sentences (emphasis in bold below mine):

> (a)     S 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code provides that where a person is sentenced to imprisonment for at least three distinct offences, the court must order the sentences for at least two offences to run consecutively.

> (b)      **Distinct offences should be punished separately with consecutive sentences so as to ensure that each legally-protected interest is properly vindicated.** Otherwise, the imposition of concurrent sentences for unrelated offences would result in **the perverse and unjust outcome of the offender not having to bear any real consequences for the further offending**.

> (c)     The court must consider whether the cumulative sentence is proportionate to the overall criminality of the offences by applying the totality principle. The principle has two limbs: first, to examine whether the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed, and second, to examine whether the effect of the aggregate sentence **on the offender is crushing and not in keeping with his past record and future prospects**. If an aggregate sentence is considered excessive, the court may opt for a different combination of sentences to run consecutively or adjust the individual sentences.

> (d)     The sentencing court must also bear in mind the aggregation principle which is that the totality principle should ordinarily apply with greater force in cases that involve longer aggregate sentences. The aggregation principle recognises the fact that aggregation in such cases **may result in a compounding effect that bears more than a linear relation to the overall criminality of the case, and that longer sentences may induce feelings of hopelessness that destroy the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation and reintegration.**

15     In _Maideen Pillai v PP_ _<span class="citation">\[1995\] 3 SLR(R) 706</span>_, the Court held (at \[7\] and \[11\]) that where consecutive sentences are imposed on an offender, the overall punishment should be in proportion to the overall gravity of his criminal conduct, taking into account the circumstances in which he offended and also the pattern of his previous behaviour. While there is no absolute rule precluding the court from making more than two sentences consecutive, **a decision to go beyond the minimum of two consecutive sentences should be taken only in exceptional cases.** (emphasis in bold mine)

16     In _Mohamed Shouffee Bin Adam v PP_ _<span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 34</span> at \[81\]_, it was held that the court would need to have regard to the totality of the criminal behaviour of the offender in considering which sentences should run consecutively. Further, the consideration of which sentences should run consecutively is a multi-factorial consideration in which the court assesses what would be a proportionate and adequate aggregate sentence having regard to the totality of the criminal behaviour of the accused person. Thereafter, the sentencing judge should then apply **the totality principle to check against an excessive overall sentence.** (emphasis in bold mine)

17     Applying the above legal principles to the present case, I took the view that **the sentence of 2 months’ imprisonment imposed on the AP for the SFA charge in DAC-930902-2019 and the sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment for the s 406 charge in DAC-930905-2019 should run consecutively, thereby giving a global sentence of 17 months’ imprisonment**. In my view, the SFA charge and the three s 406 charges are distinct offences and the sentence for the SFA charge should run consecutively with only one of the three s 406 charges so as to ensure that each legally-protected interest is properly vindicated and in order to avoid a perverse and unjust outcome of the AP not having to bear any real consequences for the SFA offence.

18     Applying the totality principle to check against an excessive overall sentence and not to impose on the AP a crushing sentence not in keeping with his past record and future prospects which may result in a compounding effect that bears more than a linear relation to the overall criminality of the case and induce feelings of hopelessness that destroy the AP’s prospects of rehabilitation and reintegration, I see no exceptional reason to order more than 2 consecutive sentences, or to order only two of the three s 406 charges in DAC-930904-2019 and DAC-930905-2019 to run consecutively without the sentence for the SFA charge (as sought by the prosecution).

## CONCLUSION ON SENTENCE

19     In the light of the above, I sentenced the AP to a global sentence of 17 months’ imprisonment which, in my view, was not manifestly excessive or inadequate, but wholly appropriate and commensurate with the nature and extent of the AP’s culpability, and was a sufficient deterrent sentence tempered with proportionality without the effect of a crushing sentence.

[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1_1)Section 82 of the SFA read with section 331(1) of the SFA provide as follows: “**Need for capital markets services licence**82.—(1) Subject to subsection (2) and section 99, no person shall, whether as principal or agent, carry on business in any regulated activity or hold himself out as carrying on such business unless he is the holder of a capital markets services licence for that regulated activity.(2) Subsection (1) shall not apply to any person specified in the Third Schedule.(3) Any person who contravenes subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $150,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not exceeding $15,000 for every day or part thereof during which the offence continues after conviction.331.—(1) Where an offence under this Act committed by a body corporate is proved to have been committed with the consent or connivance of, or to be attributable to any neglect on the part of an officer of the body corporate, the officer as well as the body corporate shall be guilty of that offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly.”

[^2]: Section 405 and 406 read with section 109 of the Penal Code provides as follows:**Criminal breach of trust**405\. Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with property, or with any dominion over property, dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use that property, or dishonestly uses or disposes of that property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged, or of any legal contract, express or implied, which he has made touching the discharge of such trust, or wilfully suffers any other person to do so, commits “criminal breach of trust”.**Punishment of criminal breach of trust**406\. Whoever commits criminal breach of trust shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years, or with fine, or with both.**Punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence, and where no express provision is made for its punishment**109\. Whoever abets any offence shall, if the act abetted is committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for the punishment of such abetment, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence.”

Under s 23 PC, “Wrongful gain” in turn refers to “gain by unlawful means of property to which the person gaining it is not legally entitled”, and “Wrongful loss” means “ loss or exposure of risk to a loss by unlawful means of property to which the person losing it or exposed to the risk of losing it is legally entitled.” In PP v _Lam Leng Hung and other appeals <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 474</span> at \[184\]_, the court stated that the question is whether “whether the accused intended to do an act that would cause wrongful gain or wrongful loss to another in circumstances where he knew that he was not legally entitled to do that act. Such an intention would often have to be proved by inference from the surrounding circumstances.”
