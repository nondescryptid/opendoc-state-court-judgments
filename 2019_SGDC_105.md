\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9107/2019/01.\]

23 May 2019

### District Judge May Lucia Mesenas:

## Background

The accused, a 20-year old male, pleaded guilty to two charges on the first day of trial, namely, one count of assisting an unlicensed moneylender in carrying on of the business of moneylending, by providing his OCBC Bank ATM card and corresponding password linked to his OCBC bank account to the said unlicensed moneylender, which is an offence under section 5(1) of the Moneylenders’ Act (Chapter 188, 2010 Rev Ed)(“MLA”) and punishable under section 14(1)(b)(i) read with section 14(1A)(a) of the said MLA (“UML charge”), as well as one count of voluntarily causing hurt under section 323 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224) (“PC”) (“VCH charge”).

2       Two other charges were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. They were for voluntarily causing hurt under section 323 PC as well as being drunk in a public place and conducting himself in a manner as to cause annoyance to another under section 14, punishable under section 14(2)(i) of the Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Act 2015 (No. 5 of 2015) (“LCA”), respectively.

3       The prosecution submitted for reformative training to be imposed whereas the defence submitted for an imprisonment term. I exercised my discretion to call for a reformative training suitability report (“RTC report”) to explore all sentencing options available. The accused was found suitable for reformative training. On 10 May 2019, he was sentenced to undergo reformative training for a minimum period of 12 months’ detention in a reformative training centre (“RTC”). Dissatisfied with the sentence, the accused, acting on his own, filed a notice of appeal on the same day. The accused is currently on bail pending the hearing of the appeal.

## Summary of Facts

4       The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts pertaining to the above charges, without qualification. The salient points are as follows:

> DAC 929478/2018 (Assisting an unlicensed moneylender)

> (a)     The accused is the registered owner of the OCBC Bank Account No. XXX (the “bank account”).

> (b)     Sometime in September 2017, the accused went online in search for moneylenders as he was in need of money. The accused came across an online advertisement promoting moneylending services, and sent a WhatsApp message to an unlicensed moneylender known as “Simon” to request for a S$500 loan. However, “Simon” denied the accused’s request due to the accused’s lack of income.

> (c)     A few days later, “Simon” contacted the accused and offered him S$400 in return for the use of the accused’s ATM card. The accused knew that “Simon” was an unlicensed moneylender and that his ATM card would be used by “Simon” for the latter’s illegal moneylending business. Nonetheless, the accused agreed to this.

> (d)     On 4 September 2017, the accused proceeded to the OCBC bank and opened the above bank account. On the same day, pursuant to “Simon’s” instructions, the accused left the OCBC ATM card linked to his bank account at a particular location. The said ATM card was then picked up by an unidentified runner of “Simon’s”. Subsequently, the corresponding passcode to the ATM card was also communicated to “Simon”.

> (e)     The accused received S$400 in exchange for providing “Simon” with the ATM card, its corresponding passcode and its linked bank account. Thereafter, the accused did not utilise the bank account at all.

> (f)     Subsequently, the bank account was flagged out for suspicious activity due to its high volume of transactions. The said bank account was used to further “Simon’s” unlicensed moneylending business from the period between September 2017 and 12 April 2018, when the account was closed. During the said period, the total amount deposited into the bank account was not less than $638,988.69 and the total amount withdrawn was no less than $639,951.60. Thereafter, the accused was arrested on 7 May 2018 on suspicion of assisting in the business of unlicensed moneylending.

> MAC 902066/2019 (Voluntarily causing hurt)

> (g)     The victim is a 20-year old female. At the time of the offence, she was 19 years old and the accused’s ex-girlfriend.

> (h)     The complainant was 19 years old and the victim’s boyfriend at the material time.

> (i)     On 24 November 2018 at about 2.00am, the victim was at the complainant’s house. The accused had sent the victim Whatsapp messages to find out her whereabouts. The victim informed the accused that she was at the complainant’s house. The accused was unhappy about this and proceeded to the complainant’s house to confront the victim.

> (j)     When the accused was at the complainant’s house, an argument ensued between him and the complainant, following which the accused and the complainant were involved in a physical scuffle. The victim managed to separate the accused and the complainant. However, at this juncture, the accused used his right hand to slap the victim twice on her left cheek. This in turn caused the victim to sustain redness on her left cheek, which resulted in the complainant calling for the police.

> (k)     Upon the police’s arrival, the accused was found to be in an emotional states and smelt strongly of alcohol. The victim did not seek any medical treatment.

> (l)     The accused had committed the current offence while he was on bail and after he was first charged in court for the offence under the MLA (UML charge) on 4 September 2018.

## Prosecution’s Submissions

6       The prosecution urged the court to call for a RTC Report in view of the seriousness of the offences, the accused’s repeat offending (despite being previously placed on two probation orders), committing offences while he was police bail (namely, the VCH charge and being drunk in a public place) as well as the accused’s lack of remorse in attempting to delay proceedings to avoid the sentence of reformative training. The accused had initially claimed trial to the current offences but had pleaded guilty on the first day of trial on 29 March 2019 (just before he turned 21 years old on 12 April 2019).

7       The accused was previously placed on probation by the Youth Court for an offence of rioting, following which he had breached the order by committing a further offence for harassment of a debtor under the MLA and placed on a second probation order with more stringent conditions as stated above. The prosecution submitted that probation would be wholly inappropriate in light of the two previous probation orders which had failed to deter his current re-offending. Furthermore, it was submitted that in view of the aggravating factors highlighted above, there was a need for deterrence and in particular, reformative training would offer the court the middle ground between sending the accused to prisons and the need to rehabilitate him, where the accused would benefit from the rehabilitative programmes under the RTC regime.

## Mitigation

8       In defence counsel’s written mitigation, he submitted for a short custodial sentence in view of the accused’s relative immaturity where he had fell into bad company and ‘was cynically exploited by uncaring and callous criminal sorts to carry out illegal deeds by way of being tempted with easy and fast pocket money’.

9       Additionally, the accused’s school reports showed that the accused performed relatively well in the Institute of Technical Education (“ITE”) in 2016 where he scored “Very Good” for “Electrical Services” and “Mechanical Services” and “Good” for “Personal and Professional Development”. In 2014, it was highlighted that the accused scored “A” for Chinese, “B” for “Computer Applications” and “Mobile Robotics” respectively for his secondary 4 Normal (Technical) examinations. He was further commended by his teachers in secondary school in that he was described as ‘a friendly and sociable student’ who is ‘always willing to help others’ and displayed a high level of commitment to do his best in his area of interest. He further displayed ‘care and concern for the community’ and ‘showed a keen interest in personal development’. He had also earned an Edusave Certificate of Academic Achievement in 2011 for being in the top 25% in terms of academic performance in his level as well as his good conduct in school. In view of the above, it was submitted that the court ought to impose a short custodial sentence ‘to register the Court’s disapproval of his errant ways’.

## Further submissions

10     The accused was found mentally and physically fit to undergo reformative training. The prosecution submitted that reformative training would be the most appropriate sentence in the circumstances given the factors highlighted above.

11     Defence counsel did not have anything further to add.

## Decision of the court

### Sentencing considerations in relation to a young offender

12     It is undeniable that the UML charge is serious as evident in the punishment prescribed, which carries a minimum fine of $30,000 up to a maximum fine of $300,000 and mandatory imprisonment term of up to 4 years. Furthermore, an offender can also be liable to caning of up to 6 strokes.

13     As for the VCH charge, the punishment prescribed is a discretionary fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment of up to 2 years or both.

14     I am mindful of the competing sentencing considerations of deterrence and rehabilitation when deciding on the appropriate sentence for the accused, a young offender, who has committed serious offences as stated above, in particular, the UML charge. That said, as a starting point, rehabilitation is generally the dominant sentencing consideration when deciding on an appropriate sentence for a young offender aged 21 years and below (see _Maurice Mok_ at \[21\] and followed in _Leon Russel Francis_ at \[13\]).

15     In this case, the accused had submitted for a short custodial sentence. Defence counsel did not submit on the sentencing principles applicable for which the court ought to consider a short imprisonment term instead of a sentence of reformative training, for which the minimum detention period is either 6 or 12 months, depending on the needs of the offender. Counsel merely stated that he was constrained by his client’s instructions. Notwithstanding that the accused may have turned 21 years old at the time of sentencing, I am of the view that the offences were nonetheless committed when he was below 21 years old, in which case, rehabilitation would still be a relevant sentencing consideration. The issue is thus whether deterrence ought to play a dominant role such that it eclipses the rehabilitative needs of the accused, and where an imprisonment term should be imposed.

16     As observed by the learned Justice of Appeal, Justice VK Rajah in the case of _PP v Mohamed Al Ansari bin Basri_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR 449</span> (“_Al Ansari_”) at \[58\]:

> .. it is clear that reformative training by itself, with the attendant element of incarceration, implicitly carries with it a significant deterrent effect, both on a specific and general level. As such, it is my view that the sentencing option of reformative training provides the courts with a middle ground that broadly encapsulates the twin principles of rehabilitation and deterrence in relation to young offenders..

17     Furthermore, it is also pertinent to note in _Al Ansari_ at \[61\] as follows:

> If the offence is so heinous and the young offender so devoid of any realistic prospect of being reformed then deterrence must form the dominant consideration, and the statutorily prescribed punishment (probably imprisonment) for the offender would be the obvious choice.

18     In determining the balance to be struck between the dominant consideration for rehabilitation and the need for deterrence, some relevant factors to be considered as stated in _Al Ansari_ at \[67\] included:

> (a)     the seriousness of the offence;

> (b)     the culpability of the offender;

> (c)     the existence of antecedents;

> (d)     the nature of the rehabilitation best suited for the offender;

> (e)     the availability of familial support in the rehabilitative efforts; and

> (f)     any other special reasons or need for rehabilitation.

19     Further, as noted by Sundaresh Menon CJ in the case of _PP v Koh Wen Jie Boaz_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 1 SLR 334</span> (“_Boaz Koh_”) at \[30\], rehabilitation can be diminished or eclipsed by considerations such as deterrence or retribution in appropriate situations, where (the “_Boaz_ factors” as termed by Chan Seng Onn J in the case of _Muhammad Zuhairie Adely Bin Zulkifli v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 134</span> (“_Muhammad Zuhairie_”) at \[23\]) :

> (a)     the offence is serious;

> (b)     the harm caused is severe;

> (c)     the offender is hardened and recalcitrant; or

> (d)     the conditions do not exist to make rehabilitative sentencing options such as probation or reformative training viable.

20     As observed by Chan J in _Muhammad Zuhairie_ at \[30\], that in light of the relevant factors as stated in _Al Ansari_ (as above), as well as consideration of the _Boaz_ factors:

> ..it would still be necessary for the court to consider all the relevant facts and circumstances which ultimately aid the court in achieving the right balance between deterrence and rehabilitation when sentencing a young offender. In the delicate balancing exercise, one of the key considerations would in my view be the _rehabilitative potential of the young offender._

21     With the above sentencing considerations in mind, I now turn to the factual matrix of the present case.

#### Seriousness of the offences

22     As stated above, the UML charge is serious in view of the punishment prescribed.

#### Culpability of the accused

23     There was no question that the UML charge was committed out of greed, and the lure of quick money when the accused was in need of money. Instead of finding legal employment to deal with his financial difficulties, the accused turned to the unlicensed moneylender when the offer came up for him to provide his ATM card and passcode linked to his bank account registered under his name, in return for $400. The said bank account was deliberately opened by the accused for this nefarious purpose, which the accused was clearly aware of. I also note that the bank account was used for illegal purposes for a relatively long period of about seven months (from September 2017 to 12 April 2018) where transactions involved totalled to a substantial amount of almost $640,000, which resulted in the bank ‘flagging’ it out as being ‘suspicious’ due to its high volume of transactions.

24     As for the VCH charge, I note that there were two victims involved (including the TIC charge) and the offences were committed while the accused was inebriated. The fact that the accused smelt strongly of alcohol at the material time is not a mitigating factor and would instead be regarded as an aggravating factor since he had consumed it voluntarily (see PP v Satesh s/o Narvalan <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 119</span> at \[17\]).

#### Existence of antecedents

25     The accused was clearly not a first offender. As stated above, he had been previously sentenced to probation by the Youth Court in 2014 for an offence of rioting, for which he had breached the probation order by re-offending and committing the offence of harassment of a debtor under the MLA. He was placed on a second probation order for this offence and another offence for voluntarily causing hurt was also TIC.

26     Whilst the accused may have completed the second probation order, yet, despite the various interventions as seen from above, the accused was still clearly not deterred when he re-offended about four months after the completion of the second probation order[^2], sometime in September 2017 for the UML charge.

## Evaluation and reasons for decision

27     As noted above, the accused had committed the UML charge despite having been sentenced to a probation order in May 2015 for a similar charge under the MLA where he committed the offence of harassment of a debtor together with other co-accused persons. Furthermore, his propensity for violence is evident when he committed the current VCH charge, which was also similar in nature to the TIC charge when he was sentenced to the second probation order. Further, his first brush with the law was similarly for a violence related offence of rioting when he was sentenced to his first probation order in the Youth Court. It is evident that the accused has a blatant disregard of the law in not only repeatedly committing offences of a similar nature, namely, offences under the MLA as well as violence related offences, he had also failed to abide by his bail conditions, especially when he committed the VCH charge (on 24 November 2018) while he was on police bail and even after he was charged in court for the UML charge on 4 September 2018.

28     I also note in the RTC report that the accused’s antisocial patterns of behaviour linked to violence, which precipitated the commission of the previous offence of rioting and current VCH charge, was due to his ‘poor ability to manage negative emotions and stress’. In particular, he was unable to manage his anger (namely, he was angry with his ex-girlfriend for cheating on him) or when he is provoked by the victims (namely, when the victims pushed him and he retaliated in anger)[^3].

29     There was also a genuine lack of remorse where the accused seemed to minimise his actions and the impact on others, where he reported that he did not think that the UML charge was serious given that he did not physically harm others and felt that it was unfair that he was charged in court for such an offence[^4].

30     In light of the above aggravating factors, as well as the fact that the previous probation orders had plainly failed to deter him in committing these current offences, which are also serious, there is thus evidently a need for specific deterrence, which must be reflected in the sentence to be imposed, to deter the accused from his criminal offending ways.

31     I now turn to the accused’s personal circumstances. In particular, I note the accused’s weak familial ties, where he reported that he was not close to his family members and did not confide in them. The strained relationships between him and his mother and brother were often marked with frequent quarrels over money issues. There is clearly a lack of emotional support from his mother as well, who was only able to provide him with the bare necessities such as food and money.

32     The accused was also not constructively engaged after he dropped out of ITE in end 2017 and where he reported a period of unemployment thereafter. It was only in early 2018 where he eventually secured stable employment in a construction company until he was enlisted into National Service (“NS”) in October 2018. However, he did not turn up for work in NS as he was unhappy with the job posting, often applying for medical certificates on several occasions even when he was not unwell[^5].

33     The accused had also used maladaptive ways of coping with stress and insomnia when he started consuming alcohol regularly from mid-2017. Whilst his alcohol use did not interfere with his health or daily functioning, it is noted that it had clearly contributed to the commission of his offences, specifically for the VCH charge as well as causing annoyance whilst drunk in public[^6].

#### Selection of the appropriate sentence

34     Having taking into account the nature of the offences, the accused’s previous antecedents as well as his personal circumstances, the issue then is whether deterrence has totally displaced rehabilitation such that an imprisonment term would be the preferred sentencing option.

35     As the accused was a young offender at the material time, namely, below 21 years old, I am of the view that rehabilitation still retained its primacy in the sentencing matrix. Whilst the accused may have been unengaged following the completion of the second probation order in mid-2017, I note, however that there was nonetheless, no reported disciplinary infringements while he was in the hostel[^7]. This suggests that the accused was still amenable to discipline within a structured environment. Further, defence counsel also highlighted the accused’s past academic achievements, which further suggests that the accused is capable to undergo studies if given the opportunity. It would appear that there was still scope for the accused to be rehabilitated given his rehabilitative potential, where the secondary school which the accused previously attended, noted that the accused displayed a high level of commitment to do his best in his area of interest. His potential can still be tapped upon with a firm hand and guidance that the accused plainly needs.

36     Notwithstanding the need for specific deterrence as highlighted above, I did not think that the accused was such a hardened offender or that the offences were so heinous that the accused was devoid of any realistic prospect of being reformed which necessitated a custodial sentence to be imposed, similar to the case of _PP v Mohamed Noh Hafiz bin Osman_ \[2003\] 4 SLR (R) 281 (“_Mohamed Noh_”)[^8]. Whilst _Mohamed Noh’s_ case can be distinguished from the present in that the offences committed in _Mohamed Noh_ are far more serious and heinous than the present one, nonetheless, an imprisonment term, which is deterrent in nature and for which rehabilitation would have lesser dominance, would to my mind, not be the preferred sentencing option given the circumstances of the present case. The accused’s poor familial support, his pro-criminal thinking as well as regular consumption of alcohol (which appears to embolden him into committing offences), may not be adequately addressed after he serves an imprisonment term, especially if it is a short custodial sentence.

37     I am thus of the view that reformative training would, instead, allow the accused to undergo the various rehabilitative programmes under a structured environment while avoiding the danger of exposing the young offender to the potentially unsettling influence of an adult prison environment (see _Boaz Koh_ at \[38\]). All considered, a sentence of reformative training would therefore be the most appropriate sentence in the circumstances as it would represent a right balance between the twin goals of rehabilitation and deterrence (see _Al Ansari_ as above).

38     Following the recent amendments to the RTC regime, for which an offender can be recommended for either level 1 or level 2 intensity of rehabilitation, the accused would fully benefit from the minimum detention of 12 months in RTC, while undergoing all the programmes offered to address his criminogenic needs (which in this case, includes his antisocial beliefs and attitudes towards a criminal lifestyle as well as his regular alcohol consumption)[^9]. Furthermore, the accused would also be able to undergo vocational training/academic studies and intensive family programmes[^10] which he clearly requires, in order to reform him and for the prevention of crime.

_The accused was sentenced to undergo reformative training for a minimum of 12 months’ detention in a reformative training centre._

The victims were pre-pubescent girls where he followed them into lifts when they were returning home alone. He would follow them into the lifts and approach them from behind after they emerged from the lifts, covered their mouths and dragged them to a staircase landing where the offences were committed. The accused was sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane.
