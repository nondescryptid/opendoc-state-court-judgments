### District Judge Jasbendar Kaur:

## Introduction

1       The Accused, Samuel Sia Pik Hing, 30-year-old male Malaysian was tried on one charge under section 324 read with section 511 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Rev Ed) and one under section 324 of the same. The first charge accused him of attempting to voluntarily cause hurt to the first victim, one Yap Jin Hong Randy (hereinafter referred to “PW 1”), by means of a dangerous weapon by thrusting a broken glass bottle into his left rib cage area with the intention to cause hurt to him. Under the second charge, he was accused of voluntarily causing hurt to the second victim, one Hugh Lee Jin Peng (hereinafter referred to as “PW 2”) by means of a dangerous weapon by stabbing him with a broken glass bottle at his abdomen area with the intention to cause hurt to him.

2       The trial was heard over 5 days and a total of 11 witnesses (including the Accused and one defence witness) testified. At the conclusion of the trial, I acquitted the Accused on both charges.

3       These grounds are issued as the Prosecution lodged a Notice of Appeal against his acquittal.

## Brief Background

4       The Accused was working as a cashier at the coffeeshop located at Block 501, Jurong West Street 51 during the material time. On 4 August 2019, the Accused’s brother visited the coffeeshop to celebrate his birthday with his friends. During the course of the evening, the Accused’s brother had an altercation with a group of older men who were there drinking when his chair accidentally “knocked” the chair occupied by one of the older men, Toh Yong Bee. Toh Yong Bee assaulted the Accused’s brother for not appearing sufficiently apologetic and then the group of older men left the coffeeshop. When the Accused was alerted by his supervisor, one Yong Chek Eng (hereinafter referred to as “PW 6”) that his brother had been assaulted, he rushed down to check on him. The CCTV camera located at the lift landing next to the coffeeshop captured the Accused rushing down from level 2 and entering the coffeeshop and then dashing out to confront the group of older men who had assaulted his brother.

5       According to Prosecution, two fights took place after the Accused dashed out to confront the group of older men with a beer bottle. The first fight involved the Accused and the group of older man, including some bystanders who joined in to assault the Accused (hereinafter referred to as the “first fight”) and the second fight involved the Accused and the victims (hereinafter referred to as the “second fight”).

6       When the first fight was going on, the victims and their friends ran over from across the road to where the fight was taking place to observe it. After the first fight ended, it was the Prosecution’s case that the Accused in his angry and agitated state decided to attack the first and second victims with a broken beer bottle by stabbing them in their rib cage/abdominal area. The first victim managed to escape unscathed as he was wearing a jacket, but the second victim sustained injuries to his abdominal area and neck. The altercation ended when the Accused’s friends intervened and led him back to the coffeeshop

7       The Accused denied attacking PW 1 and PW 2 and claimed that he did not recognise the victims and did not see them during the incident. It was his case that he had armed himself after the first fight to attack the victims’ friend, one Ong Yi Kai Zander (hereinafter referred to as “PW 3”) who was continuously scolding and provoking him. Basically, the Accused disputed the Prosecution’s case that (i) the victims and their friends did not engage in any anti-social behaviour during and after the first fight and (ii) he had attacked the two victims with a broken beer bottle after the first fight. The Accused did not deny arming himself with a beer bottle when he confronted the group of older men or when he decided to confront PW 3 but insisted that he did not break the bottle to confront and/or attack them.

## The Undisputed Facts

8       Based on the contents of the CCTV footage submitted by the Prosecution (Exhibit P14), the following facts were not disputed by both parties:

> (a)     The fight in the coffeeshop started at about 20:07:10;

> (b)     The Accused’s colleague called and informed the Accused’s supervisor at about 20:08:42 and he rushed down from level 2 to check on his brother at about 20:09:04;

> (c)     About 18 seconds later at about 20:09:22, the Accused rushed out in anger with a glass bottle to confront the group of older men who were then standing near the 7/Eleven store;

> (d)     The Accused managed to hit one of the older men before the group charged at him. The Accused was quickly over-powered and mauled by the group and by the bystanders who joined in to assault him;

> (e)     The fight slowly moved to a location behind the lift shaft, beyond the view of the CCTV camera;

> (f)     The two victims and their friends, PW 3, Teo Jian Wei (hereinafter referred to as “PW 4”) and one “Keith” ran over to Block 501, Jurong West Street 51 at about 20:10:02;

> (g)     The fight behind the lift shaft continued for almost a minute before the Accused was seen being led back to the coffeeshop;

> (h)     At about 20:10:56, the Accused picked up a glass bottle and moved in an aggressive manner towards PW 1 before disappearing behind the lift shaft;

> (i)     About 23 seconds later at about 20:11:19, the Accused was led back to the coffeeshop without a glass bottle in his hand;

> (j)     The Accused’s friends and colleagues took about 41 seconds to drag him back to the coffeeshop in his agitated state; and

> (k)     The Accused then stayed in the coffeeshop to wait for the police and subsequently, the Accused and his brother were taken to the hospital in an ambulance.

9       Based on the objective evidence provided by the CCTV footage, it was clear that the Accused had confronted the group of older men with a beer bottle in his hand and he was overpowered by the group of older men as soon as the fight started. What was not clear in relation to the first fight was whether he had broken the bottle before he confronted the group and whether the victims and their friends had joined the fight. It was also unclear whether the Accused had quarrelled with PW 3 after the first fight ended and whether he had subsequently grabbed another beer bottle to attack PW 3 or the two victims.

## Prosecution’s Theory of Guilt

10     The Prosecution’s case against the Accused was that he had specifically targeted the two victims and had “aggressively” attacked them with a broken glass bottle as he had assumed that they had joined the first fight. It was also their case that the victims and their friends had not scolded and/or provoked the Accused after the first fight ended and that all they did after they arrived at the scene was to observe and to stop the first fight. There was also some suggestion that PW 1 and PW 2 were attacked as they happened to be standing close to the Accused when he armed himself with a bottle and/or the Accused had viewed them as easy targets since they were both smaller in size.

## The Evidential Burden on the Prosecution

11     To prove the charges against the Accused, the Prosecution had to prove the following critical aspects of their _theory of guilt_ (based on the evidence of the Prosecution’s witnesses and the case put to the Accused when he was cross-examined):

> (a)     The first fight had not ended when the victims and their friends arrived at the scene and that they had entered the fray only to deescalate the situation to stop the fight;

> (b)     None of the youths had done or said anything to provoke and /or abuse the Accused and that he attacked them because he had mistakenly believed that they had entered the fight and had assaulted him;

> (c)     The Accused had grabbed and smashed the glass bottle that he had removed from the crates placed outside the coffeeshop with the intention to attack the two victims;

> (d)     The Accused had first targeted PW 1 as he was small sized and he had threatened him, “I see you small size. I also want to stab you.” before stabbing him at the left side of his rib cage;

> (e)     The Accused did not manage to cause any injuries to PW 1 as he was wearing a jacket;

> (f)     The Accused next targeted PW 2 and had asked him, “You also want?” before “poking” him with the same broken beer bottle at his abdominal area, causing him to sustain injuries;

> (g)     PW 2 retaliated by using his legs to sweep the Accused to the ground and he had pinned the Accused down by holding on to him as he struggled and swung his arms with the broken beer bottle; and

> (h)     The Accused was disarmed by one of the youths before he was attacked by a group of older men until he was assisted by his friends and brought back to the coffeeshop.

12     The Prosecution submitted that they managed to prove their case beyond reasonable doubt as the evidence of their witnesses was largely credible and compelling. They also submitted that the Accused’s defence and the evidence of his witness, one Kong Teck Fung (hereinafter referred to as “DW 2”) was confusing, illogical and did not “cohere” with the CCTV footage of the entire incident.

13     After considering the evidence of the Prosecution’s witnesses and the evidence in totality, I found that the Prosecution failed to prove their _theory of guilt_ beyond reasonable doubt. This was mainly because the evidence of their witnesses on the material aspects was not consistent, raising a serious doubt in the credibility of the Prosecution’s case on why and how the victims were attacked by the Accused.

14     I will now discuss the evidence and explain my findings.

## Court’s Findings

15     The Prosecution’s case largely hinged on the credibility of the evidence of PW 1 and PW 2 as the charges concerned the attacks on them. To prove their case against the Accused, the victims’ individual evidence had to be (i) inherently consistent, (ii) consistent with each other’s evidence and with the evidence of the other Prosecution witnesses who were there at the scene since the attacks were part of a continuum and (iii) any extrinsic evidence; i.e.; the CCTV footage Exhibit P14 \[See **_Farida Begam d/o Mohd Artham v PP_** <span class="citation">\[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 592</span> at \[9\]\]. After analysing the Prosecution’ evidence and the evidence in totality, I found that the Prosecution’s case in relation to the interaction of the victims and their friends with the Accused and the sequence of events leading to the alleged attacks on the victims suffered from material inconsistencies.

## Part 1: The serious inconsistencies within the Prosecution’s case

### Inconsistencies between the evidence of PW 1 and PW 2

16     Briefly, PW 1’s version was that he and his friends ran over to Block 501 out of curiosity and to stop the fight. By the time they arrived at the scene, the first fight had stopped and only the Accused and two of the older men were shouting at each other. He stated that he decided to intervene to “calm” the Accused down as he was still very agitated, and he was bleeding from a head wound. He did this by telling him “Enough, Stop. Don’t fight.” When he said this, the Accused started walking back towards the coffeeshop and PW 1 followed him to continue in his efforts to calm him down. According to PW 1, the Accused then suddenly grabbed a beer bottle and charged at him after smashing it against a pole. PW 1 stated that the Accused stabbed him once and when this was happening, PW 2 was “trying to get a hold of him.”[^1]

17     PW 2’s description of the same sequence of events was quite different. He stated that the group walked over normally just to watch the first fight and when they arrived at the scene, they saw the Accused and five to seven older men shouting vulgarities at each other. According to PW 2, PW 3 intervened to “pull the old men away” while both he and PW 1 stood aside to watch.[^2] In fact, it was his evidence that both he and PW 1 moved towards the coffeeshop as “Uh, we ---actually wanted to go down and sit down.”[^3] When they were near the coffeeshop, they saw the Accused running in their direction - “Just watching like from far and I ---we just know he ran over.”[^4] He had then observed the Accused taking a bottle from the crates, smashing it and attacking PW 1 after shouting “You are small size, I want to eat you.” before attacking him (PW 3) in a similar manner. According to him, PW 1 was just standing near the coffeeshop and not talking to anyone when he was attacked by the Accused with the broken beer bottle[^5]

18     As it can be seen from above, the evidence of PW 1 and PW 2 on what they did when they arrived at the scene and on how they were attacked was wholly different. PW 1 suggested that he had intervened to deescalate the situation as he was concerned about the accused’s well-being and may have been attacked for doing this. PW 2, on the other hand, stated that they had stayed away from the Accused until they became victims of an unprovoked attack by the Accused. To me, these two different narratives could not be reconciled. This was because if PW 2’s recall was accurate and he told the truth, then PW 1’s evidence that he had jumped in to intervene and that he had followed the Accused when he walked off in an agitated state in the direction of the coffeeshop had be rejected. On the other hand, if PW 1’s recall was accurate and he told the truth, then PW 2’s evidence that he and PW 1 did not get involved and were standing aside to watch the fight when they became victims of a random attack had be rejected. Further, even if it is assumed that PW 1 had intervened to deescalate the fight before walking with PW 2 to the coffeeshop, it is difficult to understand why PW 2 failed to mention PW 1’s dramatic intervention when he was there and would have witnessed it.

19     The other inconsistency was the fact that PW 1 omitted to mention that the Accused had threatened to attack him as he was small- sized – “You are small size, I want to eat you.” This was an interesting inconsistency as it is odd that PW 1 failed to mention the threat that was specifically directed at him when his friends could remember it in detail, suggesting that the threat may not have been uttered.

20     Apart from PW 2’s version of the events being inconsistent with PW 1’s, his evidence on what happened after he had allegedly felled the Accused and pinned him was also unclear. It was his evidence that after he swept the Accused to the ground and pinned him, he had held on to him until the “uncles” returned to assault him. When he was asked to explain how he had avoided being hit by the “uncles” since both he and the Accused were lying on each other, he first answered “I cannot remember. Like I only know I ---I was like on the floor than I holding his shirt.” When he was queried on how he managed to keep the Accused “pinned down”, he first answered, “I don’t know” and “I cannot remember” a few times before suggesting that he managed to do this as the Accused “never run then I just hold his shirt”. He later stated that after both fell, the Accused had stood up, but he managed to pull him down again by grabbing his shirt “so he cannot get away”. [^6] He said that he held the Accused in this manner until the “uncles” came to “untie him” and that was when he (PW 2) managed to walk away[^7]. Basically, he could not explain clearly what happened after both he and the Accused fell to the ground and he also vacillated several times when clarifications were sought from him.

21     PW 2’s evidence on the injuries that he sustained during the attack was also rather ambiguous. He had initially claimed that all the injuries that he had sustained as shown in photographs that were taken by PW 1 after they left the scene were caused by the Accused (Exhibits P 7 to P 9). He stated that the scratch mark on his neck was caused when the Accused was swinging his arms when he was “pinning him down”. When he was questioned on how the Accused only managed to cause an abrasion on his neck (as shown in Exhibit P7) when he was allegedly armed with a broken beer bottle when he was swinging his arms, he could not provide a compelling explanation. During cross-examination when the Accused asked him if he was suggesting that he (the Accused) had only “slightly touched” his neck with the broken bottle, PW 2 answered that while the “poking” action was forceful, the injury on his neck occurred when the Accused “slightly touch something.”[^8]

22     In relation to the injury on his stomach area, PW 2 had initially suggested that the Accused had “poked” the bottle into his abdomen once but when he was questioned further, he vacillated and said that the Accused could have “poked” him more than once[^9] before stating that looking at the holes in his t-shirt that he wore that night, it was likely that he was stabbed twice. Further, the injuries in his abdominal area did not cohere with his evidence that the “poking” action was forceful. Photograph P8 showed that he suffered minor injuries on his abdomen, i.e.; a linear abrasion and a singular minor cut and if he was stabbed twice with a broken bottle with “many sharp parts”, one would expect PW 2 to suffer from several cuts and possibly deeper cuts. As for the injuries on his leg, he initially could not explain how he had sustained the scratches and later admitted that the scratches may have been caused by the fall and not by the Accused.

23     The Prosecution argued that even though PW 2’s evidence on what happened after he fell the Accused to the ground was not clear, his evidence on the main injury (the cut and abrasion on his abdomen) was credible since he had “consistently maintained that the accused had stabbed his abdomen.” and that this part of his evidence was collaborated by the injuries that he had sustained and the holes in the t-shirt that he was wearing that night.[^10] In relation to the holes in his t-shirt, the number and size of the holes as shown in photograph Exhibit P 11 suggested that the sharp edges of the broken bottle must have cut right through the t-shirt at several points. Yet, the injuries in photograph P 8 suggested that the broken bottle may have only “slightly touched” him at two points since he only suffered a small cut and an abrasion. Basically, PW 2’s evidence on how he was attacked by the Accused and what happened after he had allegedly felled him to ground to subdue him suffered from several inherent inconsistencies.

24     Further, apart from the fact that the material aspects of the evidence of PW 1 and PW 2 could not be reconciled, their evidence on the sequence of events leading to the attacks was also not consistent with the evidence of the other Prosecution witnesses.

### Inconsistencies between the evidence of the victims and PW 3 and PW 4

25     Contrary to what the victims had stated, PW 3 stated that the first fight was still going on when he and his friends arrived at the scene. He said that when he saw the Accused beating up one “Simon” who was his friend’s father[^11], he and his friends “tried to stop the fight and we just pulled ‘Simon away” and when they did this, the fight stopped. PW 3 stated that they had then decided to leave and as they were walking away, they heard the Accused shouting again. This caused him, “Chin Wei” and PW 1 to turn back to “settle this thing peacefully and stop the fight” as they did not want “any more disputes” in their neighbourhood. According to PW 3, he saw the Accused taking a bottle and charging at PW 1 after breaking it when they turned back.[^12]

26     The first discrepancy concerned PW 3’s evidence that he had intervened together with PW 2 and “Chin Wei” as PW 2 had testified that only PW 3 intervened to assist “Simon”.[^13] If PW 3’s recall was accurate and reliable, then PW 2’s evidence that he did not get involved and was “Just watching like from far” had to be rejected. Further, if PW 2 told the truth, PW 2 may have downplayed his involvement in the first fight when he testified that he stayed away from the first fight and observed it from afar.

27     The second discrepancy concerned PW 1’s evidence. It was PW 3’s evidence that after the first fight ended, he, “Chin Wei” and PW 1 were leaving the place when they heard some shouting that caused them to turn back to “settle this thing peacefully and stop the fight.”[^14] He also stated that it was at this point that he saw the Accused taking a broken bottle and charging at PW 1 after saying in Chinese “I see you’re small size, I want to hit you.” If PW 3’s evidence on the sequence of events is accurate, then PW 1’s evidence that he was trying to calm the Accused down when he was attacked had to be rejected as it was simply difficult to reconcile the two versions.

28     PW 4’s sequence of events that related to the attacks on the victims was also different. Like PW 3, PW 4 testified that when they arrived at the scene, the Accused was still fighting with “Simon” and some older men near the railings.[^15] PW 4 claimed that it was he who had tried to separate the group by dragging “Simon” away from the Accused. According to him, the victims were attacked when he, PW 1, PW 2 and PW 3 were walking away with “Simon”. His version was that when one of the older men started assaulting the Accused again after shouting ‘oi’, the Accused grabbed a bottle from the crates and smashed it before attacking PW 1 as he “was just standing beside him”.[^16] PW 4 stated that he heard the Accused telling PW 1 that “You are small size, I want to eat you” before he “poked” him. It was also his evidence that PW 1 ran away in a circular motion when he was attacked and since PW 2 was standing behind PW 1, the Accused then “just attacked Hugh”.

29     The material discrepancy in PW 4’s evidence concerned PW 1’s evidence. If PW 4’s recall is accurate that he and his friends were leaving the place and had turned back when the fight restarted, then PW 1’s evidence that he was trailing the Accused when he was attacked could not be true. What was interesting was that PW 4 was the second Prosecution witness who insisted that PW 1 was leaving place with “Simon” when he and his friends turned back to settle the fight; suggesting that PW 1’s claim of being a good Samaritan could have been a fabrication.

### Inconsistencies between the evidence of the victims and PW 7 and PW 8

30     The evidence of Soh Peng Guan (hereinafter referred to as “PW 7”) and Tan Poh Tee (hereinafter referred to as “PW 8”) contradicted the claim by the victims and their friends that they did not join the first fight and did not quarrel with the Accused after the first fight ended. Their evidence also suggested that PW 2 may have sustained his injuries during the first fight.

31     In relation to the first point on whether the victims and their friends had joined the first fight, PW 7 stated that he saw the “teenagers” arriving at the scene and “charging forward” as soon as they arrived when the Accused was “on the floor” and fighting back[^17]. PW 8’s evidence was that the “kids/teenagers” who arrived at the scene also joined the fight and had assaulted the Accused. [^18] PW 8 in fact stated that the adults stopped hitting the Accused when the “kids” came forward to hit him after he fell - “He was already hit by the kids, why should we hit him some more?”

32     PW 7’s version also contradicted the evidence of PW 1, PW 3 and PW 4 that the fight stopped when they intervened. PW 7 stated that the first fight stopped when the Accused’s supervisor, PW 6 told them to stop fighting. He also stated that the fight did not restart thereafter – “After that, the supervisor came down and said, “stop fighting”…Then we left.”[^19]. PW 8’s evidence on this was similar in that he stated that after the “kids/teenagers” started assaulting the Accused, the adults stepped away and he and PW 7 left soon after – “We faster run away.”[^20] What is important is that both PW 7 and PW 8 did not mention the fight being stopped by PW 1, PW 3 or PW 4.

33     The significance of these discrepancies is that they contradicted the very core of the Prosecution’s case that the youths had not joined the first fight to assault the Accused or to provoke him. This is a material discrepancy as it raised serious concerns about the credibility of the evidence of the two victims. Essentially, the evidence of PW 7 and PW 8 suggested that the involvement of the victims and their friends in the first fight may not have been altruistic as they had claimed and that it is highly likely that they had joined the fight just like some of the bystanders who were captured in the CCTV footage.

34     Most importantly, their evidence considered together lent some credence to the Accused’s evidence that (i) after the first fight, a “plump youth” had provoked him and that (ii) the youths had scolded him and shouted vulgarities at him as he was being led away by his friends. It also suggested that Yong Teck Fung (hereinafter referred to as “DW 2”)’s evidence was not inherently incredible when he stated that he had seen the Accused quarrelling with some youths and that the youths had scolded and provoked him when he was being dragged back to the coffeeshop by his friends.[^21]

35     The second point concerns the sequence of events. The Prosecution’s case was that the Accused had attacked the victims after the first fight ended and thus, the injuries that PW 2 suffered which he had shown to PW 8 were sustained in a separate incident. It was also the Prosecution’s submission that PW 2’s evidence was contemporaneously corroborated by the fact that he had immediately shown his injuries to PW 8 which was witnessed by PW 7. I had much difficulty in agreeing with the Prosecution as the evidence of PW 7 and PW 8 considered together suggested that PW 2’s injuries may have been sustained during the first fight and not in a separate incident.

36     According to PW 7, he had looked for PW 8 soon after the first fight ended and as he was walking towards him, he saw a “kid” showing a cut at his stomach area to PW 8. The significance of this evidence is that both he and PW 8 testified that they left the place soon after the first fight ended, and the Accused was still seated on the ground at that point. Therefore, if PW 2 had shown his injuries to PW 8 before PW 8 and PW 7 left the place, he could not have sustained the injuries in a separate attack. Further, if he had sustained the injuries as per his version, both PW 7 and PW 8 should have seen the Accused arming himself and attacking the victims and testify to this fact which they did not.

37     The Prosecution also relied on PW 8’s evidence that he had seen the Accused stabbing a kid wearing a jacket and argued that this evidence materially corroborated the evidence of the two victims since PW 8 remembered this even in his confused state. The problem was that PW 8’s narrative of the events was muddled and since he only mentioned the injured “kid” wearing a black-coloured jacket after he was shown the CCTV footage at 08:10:50[^22], it is unclear whether the footage had the effect of refreshing his memory or that he had decided to conveniently add this detail after watching the said footage.

38     Second, even if I were to accept PW 8’s evidence that he had seen a “kid” wearing a jacket being stabbed, his evidence would not be sufficiently reliable to corroborate PW 1’s evidence. This is because his evidence on when the “kid” was stabbed was not consistent even with the Prosecution’s case. He was insistent that the attack on the youth could not have taken place after the first fight started[^23]. Even when he was shown the CCTV footage captured at 08:10:50, he stated that “He (the Accused) already fell behind. He couldn’t stand up and thrust the kid. He thrust the kid earlier.”[^24] He was so insistent that he got agitated when he was questioned by the Prosecution on this point and he went on to affirmatively state that “I’m very sure he thrust the kid first, then he charged towards us…If he charged towards us, then he already fell on the floor. How can he go and thrust the kid? Ambulance already there.”[^25] Based on this, I decided that it was generally unsafe to rely on PW 8’s evidence. This included his evidence that he heard the Accused say, “I want to stab(eat) the kid.” when he was shown the CCTV footage captured at 08:10: 50 as he had prefaced his response by admitting that he was “Very confused. I didn’t see.” the incident captured in the recording.[^26]

39     Considering the above, I could not agree with the Prosecution that the victims’ “account was largely consistent with what was witnessed by the other prosecution witnesses.”[^27] Although certain aspects of their evidence were consistent, the material discrepancies in their evidence in relation to the sequence of events, how they were involved in the first fight, what their friends did and how they were attacked were extremely troubling. This was mainly because one would expect the victims and their friends to have observed generally the same things since they all arrived at the scene together and had observed the same things.

### The Inherent Weakness in the Prosecution’s Case

40     The Prosecution argued that there were only three inconsistencies in their case, and they were:

> (i)     how the glass bottle was broken when the Accused confronted the older men;

> (ii)     whether the Accused was assaulted by the older men after he had attacked the victims; and

> (iii)     whether the Accused has used two bottles when he confronted the group of older men.

41     They submitted that these inconsistencies were not material to the charges being made out as “they either relate to events that are after the incidents in the charges, or do not affect the _mens rea_ and _actus reus_ of the charge.” The fact was that these were not the only inconsistencies in their case and the other inconsistencies were more serious in nature, especially when the evidence of the other witnesses contradicted the evidence of the two victims on the sequence of events leading to the attacks on them. This, in my judgment, was the main weakness in their case, raising a serious doubt even after giving due consideration to one’s fallibility to recall events after some time has passed.

42     In addition, I was also unable to agree with the Prosecution that the victims and their friends had no reason to collude or embellish their accounts as they had no motive to lie about what happened that night since they were strangers to the Accused. It was their case that the victims and their friends did not enter the first fight as they did not want to add “fuel to the fire”[^28] and that their involvement, if any, was to put an end to the fight to ensure peace in their neighbourhood. The fact was that the evidence of victims and their friends that they did not get involve in the fray was contradicted and there was some suggestion that they may have added “fuel to the fire” and may have continued to do so until they left the place. Based on this, I had to consider whether the victims and their friends could have been motivated to embroider their evidence to incriminate the Accused to avoid being investigated and prosecuted for assaulting the Accused. In other words, even though the youths were strangers to the Accused, the possibility that they could stand to gain by casting themselves as peacemakers and/or innocent bystanders could not be excluded.

43     Therefore, based on the reasons stated above, a reasonable doubt was clearly raised from “within the case mounted by the Prosecution.”

## Part 2: Assessment of the Prosecution’s case with regard to the totality of the evidence

### Assessment of the Accused’s Evidence

44     It was the Accused’s case that after he saw his brother bleeding, he grabbed a beer bottle from one of the tables and rushed out of the coffeeshop to find out who had assaulted him. When he asked, “Who hit my brother?”, someone directed him to the three men standing near the 7-Eleven. He stated that he was very angry when he approached the three men and as he came closer to them, he had sought confirmation by turning around to ask “Is it that three?”.[^29] According to him, he only managed to hit one of them with the beer bottle that was his possession before the older men charged towards him and the fight started - “That was how the fight started, I think I hit one man on his head.” He stated that all this happened so fast that he did not manage to ask them why they had attacked his brother.

45     The Accused insisted that the bottle in his possession was unbroken when he had used it to hit one of the older men and that it was snatched away from him before he could use it again. He also added that the unbroken bottle was used to hit his head when the fight started, and he did not know what happened to it once he was mauled by the group as he had to focus on protecting himself with many people hitting him. He referred to the CCTV footage and stated that the group attacking him kept moving because he was trying to get away from them - “When they were trying to hit me, I---moved backwards. I think I moved and when I fell and got up, it was near the bus stop.”. He could recall one of brother’s friend coming forward to pull him away and it was at this point that he saw some young men near him -“We were face to face.” [^30]

46     He stated that he noticed one tall and a “bit plumb” young man and another who was a “slimmer guy, smaller built” and he had assumed that they were involved in first fight and had assaulted him.[^31] He then started quarrelling with the taller, “a bit plump guy” as he had “scolded” him and said some provocative things about him being a Malaysian. As they quarrelled, they had also shouted vulgarities at each other. The Accused stated that this quarrel had nothing to do with the first fight with the older men or the attack on his brother and that he quarrelled with the “plump guy” because of what he was saying to provoke him.

47     It was the Accused’s case that his brother’s friend pulled him away from the “plumb guy” and told him to stop quarrelling. According to him, the “ a bit plumb guy” followed him and continued to scold him “trying to provoke me”[^32] - “They were scolding me. They continuously scolding me.” When he came close to the crates for the beer bottles that were placed outside the coffeeshop, he took a beer bottle and turned around as “I want to hit the plumb guy.” He said that he was provoked to fight with PW 3 as the vulgarities angered him – “I ---heard him saying “fuck my mother” to me. My mother is not for him to scold, so I’m very angry and I remember these words.”[^33] However, he did not manage to do this as his brother’s friend took away the bottle from him and others held on to him. Thereafter, he and the “plump guy” continued to quarrel until he was pulled back again to the coffeeshop.[^34] He stated that the “plumb guy” and his friends stayed for “a short while” before they left the scene.[^35]

48     In relation to the events that were captured in the CCTV footage at 20:10:56, the Accused stated that it showed the part when he had taken the bottle to attack the “a bit plumb guy”. He insisted that he did not attack PW 1 or PW 2 and that in actual fact, he had no recall of seeing them at the scene.[^36]

49     It was the Prosecution’s case that the Accused’s account of the sequence of events was confusing and not logical and more importantly, it was not consistent with the CCTV footage of the events. They also argued that his cross-examination of PW 1 and PW 2 and their friends had not shaken their credibility.

50     In relation to the second point, it was a fact that the Accused did not ask many questions in cross-examination and was mostly unsure about what to ask to put his case to the witnesses. However, I gave little or no weight to this since he was a litigant-in-person who had to conduct his own defence.

51     As for the first point, I would agree with the Prosecution that some parts of the Accused’s evidence was wanting. There was some indication that he was trying to downplay his aggressive conduct and he had changed his evidence when he was confronted by the Prosecution during cross-examination. For e.g.; he first suggested that he decided to approach the older men to only find out why they had attacked his brother and that he had taken the bottle for self-protection. He also stated that it was the older men who had first charged at him and started the fight. When he was confronted with the CCTC footage, he admitted that it was he who had started the fight by pushing one of them.[^37] He also admitted that he confronted the older men to seek “justice” as he was very angry that they had injured his brother - “But if family members was hit, of course, you will have to seek justice.”[^38] When the Accused was asked whether he had retaliated when he was being assaulted by the group, he initially denied doing this but later admitted that he had fought back and tried to push people away when he was being hit and punched. However, I did not think that these inconsistencies were serious as they did not concern the assault on the victims.

52     Further, his evidence on his initial interaction and quarrel with PW 3, how PW 3 had scolded and provoked him and why he had grabbed a beer bottle to attack him remained unshaken and it was collaborated by DW 2. In addition, the evidence of PW 7 and PW 8 considered together also lent credence to his evidence that he did not confront the group of older men with a broken glass bottle since both did not affirmatively state that he used a broken bottle to assault them. PW 7 stated that he was uncertain whether the bottle was broken - “Possible. I drank quite a lot that day. So, I saw him holding the bottle. I saw him hitting the floor but I’m not sure whether it broke.” PW 8 also stated that he was not sure if the Accused was carrying one or two bottles and he could not recall if the bottle/s were broken.

53     DW 2, who is a friend of the Accused’s brother, witnessed the assault on his brother in the coffeeshop, part of the fight involving the older men and Accused’s altercation with the youths after the first fight ended. He did not witness how the fight with the older men started as he stayed back to help the Accused’s brother and when he started observing the fight, he saw the Accused being hit by about 5 to 6 old and young persons. He decided to intervene when he saw the group using a chair to hit the Accused after he had fallen to the ground.

54     DW 2 had also witnessed the victims and their friends arriving at the scene and quarrelling with the Accused when he was helping him to get on his feet to bring him back to the coffeeshop. It was DW 2’s evidence that one of the youths scolded the Accused very loudly for starting the first fight and reminded him that “This is Singapore, not Malaysia.”[^39] He said that he told the youths to stop agitating the Accused but they did not listen and continued to scold the Accused as they followed him back to the coffeeshop – “The kids kept following us and continued scolding and talking...”[^40] DW 2 confirmed that the Accused had grabbed a beer bottle to confront the youths as captured in the CCTV footage at 08:10:55 but added that the Accused did not manage to use the bottle as it was taken away from him by another friend who placed the unbroken bottle back in the crates.

55     When D2 was cross-examined, he admitted that he could have missed seeing the Accused attacking PW 1 and PW 2 when he was busy blocking some other youths from getting involved in the altercation, but he insisted that the Accused could not have attacked the victims with a broken bottle as alleged by them since the bottle was taken from him by another friend. He mentioned that he did see the Accused slip and fall together with one of the youths, but this was after the bottle was taken away from him. DW 2 also stated that the Accused was not physically attacked after that as some people pulled him up and led him back to the coffeeshop.[^41] The youth who had fallen together with him got up on his own. Thereafter, the youths followed the Accused for a short while, scolding him “This is Singapore. If you want to create trouble, they are not afraid.”[^42].

56     While it is true that DW 2 was unable to say with certainty that the Accused had not attacked the victims[^43] and his evidence that he had seen the Accused slipping and falling together with a youth may seemingly confirm the Prosecution’s case, this part of his evidence must be considered together with his other evidence. First, he insisted that the beer bottle was taken away from the Accused before he could use it to attack PW 3 who was scolding him continuously. Second, when he was asked why he was disagreeing that the Accused had attacked PW 1 when he was not paying attention, he stated that he had to disagree as he saw his friend snatching the bottle from the Accused and putting it back in the crates:

> Q:    You have no proper basis to---to disagree because you weren’t even paying attention to what Mr Sia was doing.

> A:    Because I saw my friends snatching the bottle from him and putting it back into the crate It’s his brother’s friend. When he wanted to dash out, the friends were all around him. I was on one-hand blocking then I turned back and looked. I know he dashed out with a bottle but the bottle was taken away and I continued to block.[^44]

57     The Prosecution suggested that DW2’s evidence did not support the Accused’s defence since he could have missed the attack when he was trying to block the other youths. In my view, if the attack on PW 2 had taken place in the manner that he had described, it is unlikely that DW 2 would have missed it as it was sustained attack and DW 2 was turning around intermittently to check on what the Accused was doing – “On one hand when I was blocking, I did turn back and see what he was doing.”[^45] More importantly, he confirmed the Accused’s case that the youths had quarrelled with him and that they had provoked the Accused by scolding him loudly when he was being dragged back to the coffeeshop.[^46] Further, DW 2’s evidence in relation to sequence of events was confirmed by the CCTV footage as it showed the Accused being dragged back to the coffeeshop by some people before he released himself to grab a beer bottle from the crates and then being dragged back to the coffeeshop again by a group of people after about 23 seconds.

## Assessment of the evidential value of the CCTV footage from 20:10:45 to 20:11:00

58     According to the Prosecution, the CCTV footage from 20:10:45 to 20:11:00 corroborated PW1’s evidence as the footage showed the Accused taking a glass bottle before moving in a threatening manner towards PW 1. It was their case that he had smashed the bottle after he moved behind the lift shaft pillar before attacking PW 1 and PW 2. They also argued that the footage showed that the Accused had ample time to attack both PW 1 and PW 2 as he disappeared behind the pillar for about 30 seconds before he was seen again being dragged back to the coffeeshop. Basically, it was their position that “The witnesses’ accounts thus coheres with the CCTV footage.”[^47]

59     Having examined the CCTV footage and observing the conduct of the other persons that was captured in the footage, I found that the footage could also be said to support the Accused’s defence for the following reasons:

> (a)     The footage confirmed the Accused’s evidence that his friends had intervened to stop him from fighting and he was dragged back to the coffeeshop after the first fight, which fact was not mentioned by the victims and their friends;

> (b)     The footage did not show him breaking the bottle and it remained unbroken even as he moved towards PW 1;

> (c)     With many bystanders standing in the vicinity as captured in the CCTV footage, it was not totally implausible that the Accused may have intended to attack PW 3;

> (d)     The presence of PW 1 in the vicinity lend credence to the Accused’s evidence that the youths had followed him when he was being dragged back to the coffeeshop; and

> (e)     The time gap of about 30 seconds that the Prosecution said supported their case, also supported the Defence’s case. The CCTV footage showed the Accused being dragged back by his friends on two occasions and this was a slow process since he was highly agitated and reluctant to return to the coffeeshop. Since his friends took about 41 seconds to drag him back to the coffeeshop from the pillar, it is unlikely that the Accused could have attacked PW 1, engaged in a sustained fight with PW 2 and then be attacked by the older men before his friends intervened and started dragging him back to the coffeeshop within 30 seconds. In fact, the time gap was only about 23 seconds.

60     Therefore, while the CCTV footage did confirm the Prosecution’s case that the Accused had grabbed a beer bottle and had turned in the direction of PW 1, it also supported certain aspects of the Accused’s defence.

## In Conclusion

61     Having examined the evidence in totality, I was left in doubt as to whether the Prosecution managed to prove their “_theory of guilt_” against the Accused and this was mainly because the discrepancies within the Prosecution’s case in relation to evidence of the two victims, their friends, PW 7 and PW 8 created a reasonable doubt in their case. The glaring inconsistencies in relation to the sequence of events leading to the alleged attacks simply could not be reconciled and more importantly, the different narratives failed to provide a coherent and reliable account of how and why the two victims were attacked.

62     I accept that there were also serious gaps in the Defence’s case but when assessing the evidence in this case, it was not my duty to decide based on which case had fewer gaps or that which provided a more probable version of what happened on 4 August 2019 at about 8.11 pm outside the coffeeshop at Block 501 Jurong West Street 51. As pointed out in **_PP v GCK_** \[2020\] 1 SGCA at \[136\] and \[140\], the flaws in Defence’s case cannot be used to “shore up” the Prosecution’s case or ameliorate the serious deficiencies:

> “136  As we recently explained in _Mohd Ariffan_ (\[130\] _supra_) at \[113\], given that the legal burden lies on the Prosecution throughout a trial, as part of its own case, the Prosecution must adduce sufficient evidence to establish the accused person’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on at least a _prima facie_ basis. One example of a failure to do so would be where, after the Defence has been called, there are discrepancies in the accused person’s testimony, but there remain significant inconsistencies _in the Prosecution’s case_ that nevertheless generate a reasonable doubt. In such a situation, the court would be obliged to acquit the accused person

>     .…

> 140    Once the court has identified the weakness internal to the Prosecution’s evidence, in the absence of corroborative evidence that can militate against this weakness such that the Prosecution’s evidence as a whole can still prove the case against the accused person beyond a reasonable doubt, weaknesses in the Defence’s case cannot ordinarily shore up what is lacking in the Prosecution’s case to begin with (see \[139\] above).”

63     Therefore, for the reasons stated above, I acquitted the Accused on the two charges – DAC 933039/2019 to DAC 933040/2019.
