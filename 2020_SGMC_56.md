Criminal Law – Offences – Unlawful Assembly

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9846/2020/01.\]

16 November 2020

### District Judge Shaiffudin Bin Saruwan:

## Introduction

1       The Accused was charged with being a member of an unlawful assembly whose common object was to cause hurt to one Mohammad Ibrahim Bin Nordin (“Arab”). This was an offence under s 143 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”).

2       The Accused and Arab were members of rival secret society gangs. The case revolved around a feud between a member of the Accused’s gang and Arab. The feud culminated in a settlement talk - which was a euphemism for a physical and likely violent confrontation - on 3 May 2017 at or about 2.26 am, at the vicinity of the coffee-shop at Blk 232 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 (“the coffee-shop”).

3       The Accused admitted that he was at the coffee-shop at the material time. He saw a gathering of people there. But he claimed that he did not know the purpose of the gathering. He also claimed that he did not know anybody at the coffee-shop. He also denied being a member of a gang.

## Facts

### The parties

4       The Accused was jointly tried with Muhammad Zulqarnian Bin Suhaimi (“Zulqarnain”) and Muhammad Faiz Bin Muhamad Ghazali (“Faiz”). All three were found guilty of the charge and sentenced accordingly. Zulqarnain and Faiz did not appeal against their convictions and sentences.

5       The following co-accused persons who had pleaded guilty to similar s 143 PC charges and called as witnesses in the trial were -

> (a)     Muhammad Erwan Bin Mohamed Halim (“Erwan”);

> (b)     Mohamad Edryn Alfyan Bin Mohamad Hermi (“Edryn”);

> (c)     Faizal Bin Mustafa (“Faizal”);

> (d)     Nur Muhammad Zulkarnain Bin Zolkiple (“Buyot”).

### The case for the prosecution

6       The Accused and the co-accused persons were members of the Sio Kun Tong (SKT) Kallang Airport gang (“SKT Kallang Airport”). They had arranged to meet at the coffee-shop for a settlement talk with Arab. This was over a dispute between Arab and Buyot. Arab was a member of a rival “SKT Tanjong” or “Tjr” gang. The dispute arose because Arab had been rude towards Buyot’s godmother. Buyot decided to teach Arab a lesson. He mobilised his gang members for this purpose. In this regard, they communicated with one another using the Whatsapp chat group that they had created and which they named “Anak2 KECYK”. The Accused was not part of this chat group.

7       Some of members of the Accused’s gang, including Buyot, Faizal, Zulqarnain and Faiz, had met up first at the flat belonging to Buyot’s godmother (“the flat”) before they proceeded to the coffee-shop. When the group left the flat and proceeded to the coffee-shop for the settlement talk, the Accused had contacted Faizal to inform him that there was a police patrol car at the vicinity of the said coffeeshop. He advised Faizal not to proceed to the coffee-shop yet. Acting on the Accused’s advice, Faizal and the others waited at a nearby block.

8       A little while later, the Accused contacted Faizal again to inform him that the coast was clear. They proceeded to the coffeeshop. When the group arrived at the coffeeshop, Arab and his gang were already waiting. The Accused and some other members of his gang were also already at the coffee-shop. Buyot and Arab sat with a few others at one table. Buyot and Arab then had the settlement talk, while their gang members sat at various tables in the coffee-shop. At one point during the settlement talk, Arab had stood up and had spoken in an aggressive manner to the people sitting at his table.

9       After the settlement talk, Buyot and Arab shook hands. It was at around this moment that the police arrived. All the members of the two gangs tried to escape. The Accused, Zulqarnain and Faiz were some of those who managed to evade the police that morning. The Accused was subsequently arrested on 23 Feb 18. Zulqarnain was arrested on 8 Jun 17. Faiz was arrested on 10 Aug 17.

### The case for the defence

10     The Accused denied that he was a member of the SKT Kallang Airport gang. He admitted that he was present at the coffee-shop sometime that morning. He claimed that he had planned to go to Johore Bahru when he received a phone call from Faizal asking to borrow money from him. Faizal was his cousin. The Accused then rode his motorcycle from his girlfriend’s flat at Punggol to the coffee-shop to meet Faizal. When he reached the coffee-shop, he handed cash $30 to Faizal. He then sat down with Faizal and a few of Faizal’s friends at one of the tables in the coffee-shop. After about five to ten minutes, he left the coffee-shop and proceeded to Johore Bahru. The Accused claimed that he did not know anyone at the coffee-shop, except for Faizal and one other tattoed person whom he had recognised. He had only spoken to Faizal at the coffee-shop that morning. He also did not know why there was a gathering of persons at the coffee-shop that morning.

11     In summary, the Accused’s defence were as follows –

> (a)     He was not a member of the SKT Kallang Airport gang;

> (b)     He did not know that there was a settlement talk between Buyot and Arab; and

> (c)     He did not share a common object with the members of the SKT Kallang Airport gang to cause hurt to Arab.

## Issues to be determined

12     It was clear that on the morning in question, there were five or more persons who had gathered at the coffee-shop for the settlement talk between Buyot and Arab. They comprised members of the two gangs ie SKT Kallang Airport and SKT Tanjong. They were seated at the various tables in the coffee-shop, while Buyot and Arab parleyed.

13     As the Accused admitted that he was present at the coffee-shop at the material time, the two questions that needed to be answered in determining whether the Accused was guilty or not guilty were –

> (a)     Was the Accused a member of the SKT gang?;

> (b)     Did the Accused share the SKT gang’s common objective to cause hurt to Arab that morning?.

## Analysis of the Evidence

### The Accused was a member of the SKT gang

14     The Accused’s assertion that he was not a member of the SKT Kallang Airport gang was against the weight of the evidence.

15     In Zulqarnain’s police statements P6 and P7, he, had identified the Accused as a member of the SKT Kallang Airport gang. Zulqarnain had disclosed that the Accused was known as “Zam Star” among the gang members[^1]. Zulqarnain also confirmed that the Accused was present with the other members of the gang at the coffee shop during the settlement talk[^2].

16     In court, Zulqarnain tried to retract what he had said in his police statements about the Accused. He said that the statements P6 and P7 had been recorded accurately save for the parts that implicated the Accused. He alleged that he had made a mistake when he told the statement recorder that the Accused was a member of SKT Kallang Airport. But this claim was incongruous with his admission that the statement had been read back to him, and that he had been given the opportunity to make amendments to his statement. When pressed about this, he offered the excuse that he had not realised the mistake at the time. However, he was unable to give any explanation how he could have made such a mistake. It was pertinent to note that during the statement recording, Zulqarnain had pointed out the Accused’s photograph from a photoboard containing some 18 or so photographs. He had identified the Accused as Zam Star and provided the Accused’s contact details to the recorder. All these pointed to the inexorable conclusion that there was no mistake on Zulqarnain’s part when he stated in his statement that the Accused was a member of the SKT Kallang Airport gang.

17     The statement recorder had also confirmed that he had recorded what Zulqarnain had told him accurately. The statement had been read back to him and he was asked whether he wished to make amendments or deletions or additions. He had not made any amendments to the incriminating parts Thereafter he had signed the statement.

18     Zulqarnain had also attempted to retract his statement that the Accused was present at the coffee-shop during the settlement talk. Once again, his attempt to do so were replete with inconsistencies –

> (a)     He had claimed that he did not tell the statement recorder that the Accused was present at the coffee-shop[^3],

> (b)     He had told the recorder that the Accused was only there to pass money to Faizal but this was not recorded down by the recorder[^4],

> (c)     When pressed about the inconsistent accounts, he said that he could not remember what he had told the statement recorder[^5].

19     There were other inconsistencies that pressed home the point that Zulqarnain was not a truthful witness on the stand. When he was asked by Mr Norhakim, Counsel for the Accused, whether he had seen the Accused that morning, he had answered “not sure” and “I don’t think so”[^6]. When he was shown what he had said in his police statements, he quickly changed his evidence and instead claimed that he had seen the Accused passed Faizal money at the main road, but that he was not present during the settlement talk as he had left straight away on his motorcycle after that[^7]. Subsequently, when DPP Li pointed out to him that it was not possible that the Accused was not present at the settlement talk because he had said that Arab and his gang were already waiting for them at the coffee-shop when they arrived, he changed his evidence yet again and claimed that the Accused was present whilst the settlement talk was in progress but was not involved in it[^8].

20     I accepted DPP Li’s submission that Zulqarnain’s statements to the police (Exhibits P6 and P7) that the Accused was a gang member of SKT Kallang Airport, and that he knew about the settlement talk, were true. I noted that Zulqarnain himself had confirmed on the stand that he had no choice but to tell the truth in his police statements because the police had already seized his handphone which contained all the contact details of his gang members[^9]. The inconsistent explanations and excuses offered by him in court were nothing more than a desperate attempt to retract those parts of his statement that had incriminated the Accused.

21     In the course of recording his police statement, Erwan had also picked out the Accused’s photograph from a photoboard. He confirmed that the Accused’s name was Nurulizam. He also disclosed that the Accused was also known as Nizam Star or Zam Star[^10]. Erwan also confirmed that the Accused was a member of the SKT Kallang Airport gang together with him, Zulqarnain, Faizal, Buyot and Edryn[^11], amongst others. He also confirmed that the Accused was present during the settlement talk. All these revelations were consistent with what Zulqarnain had disclosed to the police in his statements.

22     It was patently clear that the Accused was a member of the SKT Kallang Airport gang. It was also clear that the Accused’s claim that he did not know anyone at the coffee-shop that morning was not true. He knew both Zulqarnain and Erwan. His contact numbers were saved in their handphones. In fact, Erwan and the Accused were closer than the Accused wished the court to know. Prior to 2 May 17, the Accused and Erwan had exchanged Whatsapp messages wherein the Accused had offered to recommend Erwan for a job as a bouncer at the Hollywood Club[^12]. Terms of endearment such as “my brother”, “love you” and “Zam Star’s family (member)” were used in these messages[^13]. There was no doubt that both Erwan and the Accused were close and regarded one another with some affection. When confronted with these messages, the Accused could only say that he could not recall exchanging these messages with Erwan. He however confirmed that he was the only person who had access to his handphone[^14] at the time. As such, I was satisfied that the Accused and Erwan were the parties who had exchanged these messages.

### The Accused shared the common objective of causing hurt to Arab

#### The “Anak2 KECYK” Whatsapp chat group messages

23     The SKT Kallang Airport gang had used the Whatsapp chat group “Anak2 KECYK” as their main mode of communication. It presented the police with a smorgasbord of information concerning the circumstances that led to the settlement talk and the planning done by the gang on how to deal with Arab.

24     The settlement talk at the coffee-shop had stemmed from Buyot’s unhappiness over Arab’s insolent and insulting behaviour towards Buyot’s godmother. To add insult to injury, the godmother had helped Arab by becoming his bailor when he was arrested by the police for a separate case. It also turned out that Buyot, Arab and Faizal shared the same godmother. The audio files containing the altercation between Arab and his godmother were disseminated to all the members of the “Anak2 KECYK” chat group[^15]. There then followed a verbal altercation between Buyot and Arab over the phone whereby vulgarities were exchanged. This culminated in the ultimatum to meet for a settlement talk[^16] that morning at the coffee-shop.

25     As both Buyot and Arab were members of rival gangs, it was inevitable that their gang rivalries were brought into the dispute. References were made in the “Anak2 KECYK” chat group to Arab’s gang affiliation. There were messages touching on Arab’s affiliation with their rival “SKT Tanjong” or “Tjr” gang, and about how his leader or boss was either one “Toy” or “Lane”[^17]. Buyot had also used the “Anak2 KECYK” chat group to mobilise his SKT Kallang Airport gang members “in the north”[^18]. Messages containing references to their own gang slogans and emblems were also exchanged[^19]. The gang was also told to be on standby[^20]. Members of the gang were also directed to meet up at Buyot’s godmother’s flat at Block 224 before they made their way to the coffee-shop[^21].

26     Faizal was the leader of the gang. This was confirmed by Buyot. Faizal himself had admitted to this in court[^22]. He had used the moniker ‘_Bos Kecyk Mandek_’ in the chat group[^23]. It was also disclosed that Faizal had come to know Arab when they were both serving their sentences in the Reformative Training Centre. He said that they were not on good terms[^24].

27     The messages in the “Anak2 KECYK” chat group also revealed the gang’s intention to commit violence at the settlement talk. Faizal had sent out a photograph of himself holding a knife of a sizeable dimension[^25]. I agreed with DPP Li’s submission that this was an overt display of aggression. It was intended to stoke feelings of aggression amongst the gang members against Arab. It was clear that the gang had not intended the settlement talk to be peaceful or non-confrontational. On the stand, Faizal had denied harbouring such intention. However, he was not able to give a satisfactory explanation why he had sent the provocative photograph and the messages containing gang slogans to his gang. The context in which these messages were sent was pertinent. When considered in a holistic manner, the photograph and the gang slogans, coupled with Faizal’s animosity towards Arab, and his anger over the insults to his godmother, the inevitable conclusion was that Faizal had intended to cause hurt to Arab at the settlement talk. By sending the photograph and the gang slogans, he had broadcasted that intention to his gang members. This conclusion was consistent with Erwan’s description of Faizal’s state of mind that morning in his police statement. Erwan had said that when he was speaking to Zulqarnain on the handphone, he had heard Faizal speaking aggressively in the background. Erwan had remarked that Faizal was clearly very angry[^26].

28     Faizal’s exhortation and call to inflict violence on Arab was not lost on the group. This was evidenced by Zulqarnain’s immediate response asking whether they should also bring poles to the settlement talk. In this case, the reference to poles was a euphemism for weapons. Zulqarnain’s message showed that the group as a whole had understood that Faizal was angry with Arab, and that he intended to commit violence on Arab at the settlement talk.

29     Therefore, the Whatsapp messages showed that the gang did not intend for the settlement talk to be peaceful or non-confrontational. Instead they were ready for a physical and violent confrontation with Arab and his gang. Outside of the Whatsapp messages, there was other evidence to support this conclusion. Buyot himself had admitted that he had anticipated that violence would break out during the settlement talk because both he and Arab have anger management issues, and that the worst thing that could happen was that Arab would stab him. He also admitted that he knew Arab was mobilising his gang. That was why he had rallied his own gang members[^27], and had kept watch on the coffee-shop from his godmother’s flat at Block 224 to see how many gang members Arab had brought with him[^28]. Along the same lines, Zulqarnain had also admitted in his police statement that he would help his gang to fight if a fight broke out[^29].

#### The Accused knew about the “settlement talk” between Buyot and Arab

30     It was pertinent to note that the Accused was not in the “Anak2 KECYK” Whatsapp chat group. Therefore, I was mindful that although he was a member of the gang, it did not automatically mean that he had the same knowledge as that of his gang members who were in the chat group.

31     The Accused claimed that he did not know that there was a settlement talk between Buyot and Arab at the coffee-shop. His presence there was purely a co-incidence. He had gone to the coffee-shop because Faizal had called him to ask for a loan. He had passed $30/- to Faizal, then he had sat down with Faizal and few other unknown persons at a table and had a drink. Five to ten minutes later, he had left the place.

32     In court, Zulqarnain and Faizal had testified in support of the Accused’s version. However, their evidence readily unravelled when put under the stress test of cross-examination. Not only did their evidence did not pass muster, the Accused’s numerous assertions that constituted his defence were found to be patently untrue.

33     Firstly, the Accused’s claim that he did not know anyone else at the coffee-shop other than Faizal was a lie. The evidence showed that he was a member of the SKT Kallang Airport gang. Other than his real name, he was also known as Zam Star or Nizam Star by the other gang members. He had been positively identified by Erwan and Zulqarnain.

34     Secondly, the Accused’s claim that he had sat down for five to ten minutes with Faizal at one of the tables for a drink was wholly inconsistent with the testimonies of Faizal and Zulqarnain. Faizal had testified that the Accused had not gotten off his motorcycle which he had parked at the side of the road. Instead Faizal had walked to him to get the money[^30]. Zulqarnain had testified that the Accused had not left his motorcycle and had not sat down at a table in the coffee-shop. Zulqarnain was certain that after the Accused had passed the money to Faizal, he had left the place[^31]. These inconsistencies were significant. I agreed with DPP Li’s submission that Faizal and Zulqarnain had tailored their evidence in court to try and exculpate the Accused from any involvement in the settlement talk.

35     I have already addressed Zulqarnain’s lack of credibility as a witness in the preceding paragraphs. As for Faizal, it was pertinent to note that the third co-accused in the joint-trial, Faiz, had testified that he was seated with Faizal at the same table and they had talked for the entire duration of the settlement talk. Faiz had also confirmed that Faizal had not left the table at any point of time. He also confirmed that no one at his table had ordered any drinks that morning[^32]. There were two important take-aways from Faiz’s evidence. One, it gave away the lie that Faizal had perpetrated when he said he had walked to the Accused who was on his motorcycle. Two, it also showed that the Accused’s story that he had sat down at a table with Faizal for five to ten minutes, had a drink during that time and had spoken to Faizal, were untrue.

36     Thirdly, I rejected the Accused’s story that he had gone to the coffee-shop that morning because Faizal had called him for a loan. It was nothing more than an attempt to provide the Accused with an innocuous explanation for his presence at the coffee-shop that morning. I arrived at the conclusion for the following reasons -

> (a)     Faizal had conceded that he was actually in a much healthier financial state compared to the Accused. He had a full-time job for more than a year. He was single and was also receiving allowance from his parents. On the other hand, the Accused was burdened with paying $300 a month for the maintenance of his child. At the same time, he was also saving up for his marriage[^33].

> (b)     The Accused said that Faizal could not have asked his parents for help with the loan because he was estranged from them and had left his parents’ house to stay on his own. However, this was inconsistent with what Faizal had said in court. He confirmed that at the time, his relationship with his parents was still “okay”. Their relationship only became estranged after 2 May 17 because he was wanted by the police for the present offence, and so had to go on the run[^34]. Therefore, it was not true that the Accused was the only one Faizal could turn to for the loan. There was no reason why Faizal could not have sought help from his parents. Faizal himself was unable to give any credible reason why he had not sought help from them or for that matter from his other gang members whom he had met that morning.

> (c)     Neither Faizal nor the Accused was able to offer any credible reason why the loan request was so urgent that it had to be given that very morning.

> (d)     It was implausible that Faizal, who was at the time preoccupied with the impending confrontation with Arab and his gang, suddenly remembered that he needed $30/- urgently and to that end, had called the Accused to meet him at the very place where the settlement talk was scheduled to take place.

37     Fourthly, the Accused claimed that he did not see anything suspicious about the gathering at the coffee-shop. He said that it was normal for people to hang out with friends at coffee-shops[^35]. Again, the Accused’s claim was refuted by Faizal who had testified that the Accused had told him that something was amiss, cautioned him not to misbehave, and warned him not to create the same problems again like fighting[^36]. There was no reason for the Accused to make these statements unless he knew about the settlement talk, and the likelihood that violence would ensue.

38     Lastly, Erwan had said in his police statement[^37] that the Accused knew about the problem between Buyot and Arab and about the settlement talk. He also said that when he reached the coffee-shop, the Accused was already there. Lastly, Erwan had also disclosed in his police statements[^38] that when he and Faizal and some other gang members were on their way to the coffee-shop, the Accused had called Faizal to warn him not to go there yet as there was a police patrol car in the vicinity. Later on, when the settlement talk was in progress, the Accused had left the coffee-shop to act as a lookout for police patrol cars. He had asked Erwan to go with him to be the lookout but Erwan had refused saying that the Accused was not his boss. All these fortified the conclusion that the Accused clearly knew about the settlement talk.

#### The Accused knew that there was a common object to cause hurt to Arab

39     The Accused was a member of the SKT Kallang Airport gang. He also knew that the gathering at the coffee-shop that morning was a settlement talk between Buyot and Arab. In gang parlance, a settlement talk was euphemism for a confrontation between rival gangs, with the expectation of violence occurring. This was the case for the gathering at the coffee-shop.

40     The fact that he was a member of the gang, his presence at the coffee-shop, his knowledge about the settlement talk between Buyot and Arab, and his actions that morning ie, acting as a lookout for police cars before and during the settlement talk, led to the irresistible inference that he knew that his gang had planned to commit violence and cause hurt to Arab at the settlement talk.

#### The Accused’s lies amounted to corroboration

41     In the course of the trial, I had found that the Accused had made the following statements which had been proven to be lies –

> (a)     That he was not a member of the SKT Kallang Airport gang;

> (b)     That he did not know any of the persons who were present at the coffee-shop, other than Faizal;

> (c)     That he had gone to the coffee-shop at the behest of Faizal who had asked him for a loan. In other words, he did not know about the settlement talk.

42     Other than affecting the Accused’s credibility, I had to consider how these lies were to be treated. In _PP v Yeo Choon Poh_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] 3 SLR(R) 302</span> (at \[33\] and \[34\]), the Court of Appeal had this to say regarding lies told by the Accused –

> “The English Court of Appeal in R v Lucas (Ruth) <span class="citation">\[1981\] QB 720</span> has held that the mere fact that an accused tells lies should not be taken as evidence of his guilt, but that lies in certain circumstances amount to corroboration because it indicates a consciousness of guilt. Lord Lane CJ held at 724F that there were four criteria to satisfy before a lie could amount to corroboration:

>> … the lie … must first of all be deliberate. Secondly it must relate to a material issue. Thirdly the motive for the lie must be a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth … Fourthly the statement must be clearly shown to be a lie by \[independent\] evidence …”

43     The four criteria were satisfied in the present case. The lies were deliberate and in relation to material issues. The lies were a deliberate attempt by the Accused to dissociate himself from his gang so as to buttress his claim that he did not know about the settlement talk and the plan to cause hurt to Arab. As such, the lies by the Accused in this case amounted to corroboration of the Accused’s guilt.

#### Erwan’s Police Statements

44     Erwan was listed as a prosecution witness for the trial. However, when he was produced in court, he steadfastly refused to be affirmed despite numerous opportunities offered to him. As such, he did not testify.

45     DPP Li then applied to have his six police statements[^39] admitted into evidence pursuant to s 32(1)(i) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed). The section provided that a statement of relevant facts made by a person, orally or otherwise, are relevant facts –

> “when a statement was made by a person who, being compellable to give evidence on behalf of the party desiring to give the statement in evidence, attends or is brought before the court, but refuses to be sworn or affirmed, or is sworn or affirmed but refuses to give any evidence.”

46     I was satisfied that the conditions in s 32(1)(i) were satisfied. Erwan was a compellable witness in this case. Aa a compellable witness, he had refused to be affirmed. As such I admitted the six statements into evidence.

47     On the weight to be attached to them, I take guidance from _PP v Chia Kee Chen and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 2 SLR 249</span> (“_Chia Kee Chen_”). In that case, the prosecution had sought to rely on a statement made by the co-accused (“Febri”). In his statement, he had implicated the accused (“Chia”) ie that Chia had hit the deceased on the face repeatedly until the deceased became motionless. This formed the basis of the murder charge against Chia. The Court of Appeal noted (at \[57\]) that Febri’s statement contained a confession of his own involvement as an accomplice to murder. In such circumstances, “_there would be a real prospect of Febri making self-serving statements that minimised his role and culpability while maximising that of others_”. The risk of relying on such evidence was further amplified when Febri was not available for cross-examination (Febri was an Indonesian national and had fled to Indonesia). The Court of Appeal then went on to highlight the problematic aspects of Febri’s statement that illustrated the self-serving nature of his account.

48     I agreed with DPP Li’s submissions that the risks discussed in _Chia Kee Chen_ did not apply in the present case. A perusal of Erwan’s statements showed that he did not push responsibility for the offence on the Accused. His account as recorded in his statements clearly showed the Accused’s awareness that the gathering was unlawful, without minimising his own involvement in the offence.

49     Importantly, Erwan’s account of the offence in his statements were consistent in material aspects with the evidence of the Accused and the other witnesses. Some of these included –

> (a)     Erwan said that the Accused, Zulqarnain, Buyot, Faizal and him were members of the SKT Kallang Airport gang. This was consistent with Zulqarnain’s police statement.

> (b)     Erwan claimed that he had met Faizal, Buyot and some other gang members at another block before proceeding to the coffee-shop. This was consistent with Faizal’s testimony that they had met at the void deck of Buyot and his godmother’s block first[^40].

> (c)     Erwan said that Faizal and the Accused had sat together at a table at the coffee-shop with several other persons. This was consistent with the Accused’s testimony[^41].

> (d)     Erwan said that at one stage during the settlement talk, Arab and Buyot had a verbal argument, then resolved the issue and then shaken hands. This was consistent with the versions narrated by Faizal and Zulqarnain[^42].

> (e)     Erwan said that after Arab and Buyot had settled the matter and shook hands, he and Zulqarnain had gone to the toilet together, and after that Erwan had left first. This was consistent with Zulqarnain’s account[^43].

50     I also noted that Erwan was offered to the defence as witness. His particulars was furnished to the defence to facilitate access to him in prison. The defence had the opportunity to interview Erwan and to call him as a witness but they chose not to do so. This was unlike in _Chia Kee Chen_, where Febri was not a compellable witness and his attendance in Singapore could not be secured. For the reasons set out in the preceding paragraphs, I attached full weight to Erwan’s six statements.

51     I found the Accused guilty of the charge and duly convicted him.

## Antecedents

52     The Accused has one previous conviction which was relevant ie, rioting under s 147 PC on 7 Jul 14 where he was sentenced to 20 months’ imprisonment with three strokes of the cane. Other than that, between 2005 and 2012, he has various convictions for theft, absence without leave, desertion and possession of a controlled drugs.

## Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

53     DPP Li asked for a sentence of seven months’ imprisonment. She pointed out the Accused’s s 147 antecedent, which was an offence of a similar nature to the present offence. She also cited the sentences imposed on the co-accused persons, namely, Arab, Juhari Bin Ab Karim, Muhammad Reyan bin Rahmat and Abdul Jalil bin Mohamad Yusof. They were all given six months’ imprisonment for the same s 143 offence. Like the Accused, they were traced with similar offences and offences involving violence. Therefore, the starting point for the Accused should be six months’ imprisonment. The one month uplift was to reflect the fact that the Accused had claimed trial whereas the co-accused persons had pleaded guilty. The Accused was therefore not entitled to a sentencing discount.

## The mitigation plea

54     Mr Norhakim asked for not more than six months’ imprisonment. He highlighted that the Accused had merely acted as a lookout, and that he had not taken part in the planning of the settlement talk. He also pointed out that the Accused now has a wife and a child to support and they were entirely dependent on his monthly salary of $3800.

## The prescribed punishment

55     The prescribed punishment for a s 143 PC offence was imprisonment not exceeding two years, or with fine, or with both.

## The sentence

56     I sentenced the Accused to seven months’ imprisonment.

57     The paramount sentencing consideration was deterrence, particularly specific deterrence given the Accused’s similar antecedent in 2014. I did not agree with Mr Norhakim’s submission that the Accused had played a lesser role than the other co-accused persons. He had not just been present, but he also had acted as a lookout for his gang. For this reason, it was justified to regard him as more culpable than those who had merely been present at the settlement talk.

58     I noted that the co-accused persons were sentenced to six months’ imprisonment for the same s 143 offence. In my view, the sentences meted out on the co-accused persons should be used as a sentencing guide. All things being equal, the starting point should be the same. However, I was of the opinion that an uplift of one month was warranted to factor in the two factors that did were absent in the co-accused persons’ cases, namely, the Accused had claimed trial and so he was not entitled to a sentencing discount, and his culpability was slightly higher given that he had acted as a lookout.

## Conclusion

59     It should be noted that after the sentence was passed, Mr Norhakim had informed me that the Accused had instructed him to lodge an appeal against conviction and sentence. I offered bail pending appeal of $15,000 with one surety or $7,500 with two sureties. I also directed that the notice of appeal was to be lodged before 5.00 pm the same day. Subsequently later that day, I was told that the Accused had decided not to appeal.

60     The Accused has now lodged an appeal against conviction and sentence. He is currently serving his sentence of imprisonment.
