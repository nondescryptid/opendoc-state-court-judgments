Criminal Law – Offences – Outrage of modesty – Corroboration

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9159/2021/01.\]

4 November 2021

### District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt:

## Introduction

1       The accused, a 53-year-old male Singaporean molested a female passenger (“victim”) on a public bus by touching her breast with the back of his hand. He was charged for an offence of outraging the modesty of the said victim under s 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap. 224) (“molest charge”).

2       The accused was represented by counsel and he claimed trial to the molest charge but was convicted at the conclusion of the trial. He then admitted to and consented for two other charges of touching and molesting a different victim on a separate occasion, to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing (“TIC charges”). The accused was sentenced to five months' imprisonment in respect of the molest charge. He is appealing only against his conviction. His imprisonment sentence has been stayed.

## Charges

3       The proceeded molest charge against the accused is set out as follows for convenient reference:

> MAC-902655-2020

> You…are charged that you, on the 20th day of May 2018 at 9.32am, in SBS Bus No 166, located at Telok Blangah Road, Singapore, did use criminal force to \[the victim\], Female 23 years old, to wit, by using the back of your hand to brush against her breast over her clothes, knowing it to be likely that you will thereby outrage the modesty of the said \[victim\], and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 354(1) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

4       Following his conviction of the above molest charge, he admitted to the following two TIC charges:

> MAC 902696-2020

> You…are charged that you, on 10 February 2017, at or about 10.10am, at No 133 New Bridge Road, Chinatown Point, level 2 male toilet, Singapore, did use criminal force on \[the second victim\], Female/ 56 year old, to wit, by squeezing both her breasts with your two hands, knowing it to be likely that you intended to outrage the modesty of the said \[second victim\] and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 354(1) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224; and

> MAC 902695-2020

> You…are charged that you, on 10 February 2017, at or about 10.30am, at No 133 New Bridge Road, Chinatown Point, level 4 male toilet, Singapore, did use criminal force on \[the second victim\], Female/ 56 years old, to wit, by grabbing her left shoulder with your right hand, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 352 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

## Sentence Imposed

5       The accused was sentenced to five months’ imprisonment for the proceeded molest charge. He is presently on bail pending his appeal.

##    Prosecution’s Case

6       The prosecution’s evidence is set out in its closing submission which I will adopt as relevant and appropriate.[^1]

7       In summary, the offence occurred on the morning of 20 May 2018. The accused and the 23-year-old victim[^2] both boarded a double-decker public bus (service number 166) (“the bus”) at a bus-stop along Telok Blangah Road. He tapped his EZ link card on the EZ link card reader (“card reader”) and proceeded further into the bus. However, the bus driver[^3] called him back because there were insufficient funds stored in his EZ link card. He turned round and walked back to the card reader, presumably to tap his card again. The victim had just finished tapping her card on the card reader and was about to walk down the aisle of the bus. The accused then intentionally stretched out his left hand towards the victim and brushed against her breast (over her clothes) with the back of his hand. The prosecution’s case is that he did so knowing it to be likely that he would outage the victim’s modesty.

8       The bus driver witnessed the accused touching the victim.

9       The victim was shocked at being touched. She shouted at the accused and hit the back of his left shoulder to confront him. The accused feigned ignorance. He did not immediately apologise to the victim or explain why he touched her. He moved towards the front exit to leave the bus. However, the bus driver closed the door to prevent him from escaping. He then begged the bus driver let him go. He went down on his knees and pleaded with the bus driver and the victim to let him leave because he had another ongoing molest case and could not afford to be caught again. The police were called down and the accused was placed under arrest.

### Victim’s Evidence

10     The victim testified that that morning, she arrived at the bus stop and boarded the bus at about 9.32 a.m. There were two card readers at the front of the bus. One was located immediately next to the bus driver (“first card reader”) and the other was located across the aisle (“second card reader”). The victim tapped her EZ link card on the first card reader but realised that there was insufficient value in that card. She then stood next to the bus driver’s seat and searched her handbag for another EZ link card. At this juncture, the accused boarded the bus. He walked past the victim and headed towards the back of the bus after tapping his EZ link card on the second card reader.

11     The victim found another EZ link card in her wallet and tapped it on the second card reader. At about this time, she heard the bus driver call out to the accused asking him to pay his bus fare. After tapping her card on the second card reader, the victim turned and proceeded to walk towards the back of the bus.

12     The accused was coming towards her. As he was about to walk past the victim to her left, he extended his left hand towards the victim’s chest area and brushed her breast (over her clothes) with the back of his hand. The victim testified that the brush _took about a second_ and that she felt a _significant amount of pressure_ exerted on her left breast.[^4]

13     The victim’s reaction was immediate. She turned towards the accused and shouted at him, asking him _“why did you touch me?_” She hit the accused on the back of his left shoulder to catch his attention and pointed at him. The accused did not immediately apologise to her.[^5] Instead, he walked to the front of the bus and tried to leave the bus.[^6] The accused ignored the victim without offering an apology or explaining his action. The victim then texted a friend to complain that she (the victim) was molested on the bus.[^7] The WhatsApp messages with Tan were admitted in evidence as a contemporaneous account of what transpired on the bus.

14     The victim testified that she felt shocked and afraid. She also shivered because she had been touched.[^8] The victim then saw the accused kneel before the bus driver,[^9] begging to be let off. She heard him tell the bus driver that he had another ongoing molest case and could afford to be arrested again.[^10]

### Witness’ evidence

15     The bus driver witnessed the entire incident. He corroborated the victim’s account that the accused touched her chest.[^11] He testified that he paid particular attention to the accused because he did not pay his bus fare and called out to the accused to pay his fare. He saw the accused return to the front of the bus to pay his fare. As the accused was about to walk past the victim, the bus driver witnessed him touching the victim’s breast.[^12] The bus driver also heard the victim questioning the accused why he had touched her. The bus driver said he also asked the accused the same question.[^13] He then asked the victim if she wanted to call the police and she replied in the affirmative.[^14] The bus driver then closed the front door of the bus to stop the accused from leaving the bus. The bus driver confirmed that the accused then knelt or “_kowtowed”_ to him twice and begged to be released. The accused told the bus driver that he (the accused) had an ongoing molest case with the Police and could not afford to be arrested again.[^15]

### CCTV evidence

16     The entire incident was captured by the CCTV in the bus. The CCTV footage was not disputed and was admitted in evidence.[^16] The footage showed the accused reaching out and touching the victim’s chest area just before he walked past her.

### Post-incident events

17     The bus-driver contacted SBS Transit’s Operation Control Centre to seek assistance to call the police. The police officers arrived at the scene about 15 minutes later.[^17] A police officer testified that he brought the accused to the back of the bus to question him. The officer testified that the accused was calm when he was being questioned. The accused was then placed under arrest.[^18] The accused remained calm during the ride in the police car to the Police Cantonment Centre lock-up.[^19]

### Psychiatric condition

18     The psychiatrist from the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”)[^20] who had examined the accused after his arrest put up a report as to the accused’s psychiatric condition generally and at the time of the offence. In his report, the psychiatrist first provided the accused’s family, educational and employment history.[^21] The accused currently resides with his father and sister. He had five years of secondary school education in "Normal" stream and had obtained two "O" level passes. He had no gang involvement. He had also completed his National Service (NS) without any difficulty except that he had a physical employment standards (PES) classification of E due to a hand fracture. He is unemployed for many years but had done odd jobs and had worked as a security guard in the past.

19     He was married more than 10 years ago but the marriage lasted only a few months. He claimed that he never had a sexual relationship with anyone, including his ex-wife. He admitted to have watched pornography and masturbated in his youth but claimed to have stopped doing that for years. He denied experiencing urges to touch woman, voyeuristic or fetishistic tendencies.[^22]

20     As regards the accused’s psychiatric condition, he was first diagnosed by IMH in May 2010 with Schizophrenia. He did not follow-up after that. He was next admitted in IMH in October 2015 for relapse of Schizophrenia and was discharged after his disorganized speech and behaviour improved with antipsychotic medications. He then defaulted follow-up and treatment since January 2016. He was subsequently remanded to IMH in February and September 2017 for charges of outrage of modesty and using criminal force. He was assessed to be not of unsound mind and fit to plead. He was sentenced to 2 years of probation and currently is still under probation. His last admission was from 21 May 2019 to 21 June 2019 following his arrest for the present offence. He was noted to have some formal thought disorder and was treated with antipsychotic medications. He was last seen at the IMH on 12 October 2019. He had apparently discontinued medications for 2 months. His sister requested the doctor to discharge him from follow-up as she did not think it was necessary. He continued to attend outpatient occupational therapy at IMH.[^23]

21     In conclusion, the psychiatrist was of the view that[^24]:

> The forenamed has a diagnosis of Schizophrenia and is currently stable despite being not under any treatment with medications. He was not of unsound mind at the at the time of alleged offence. There is no direct causal link between his Schizophrenia and the alleged offence. He was also assessed to be fit to stand trial and plead in court.

22     The psychiatrist was also called to testify in court and he reiterated his professional opinion that the accused was clear minded at the material time of the offence and that he was _not_ of unsound mind. According to the psychiatrist, the accused’s sister had observed the accused to be thinking clearly that morning before the time of the offence. In summary, the accused’s psychiatric condition of Schizophrenia did not cause or contribute to his commission of the present offence.

## Close of Prosecution’s Case

23     At the close of the prosecution’s case, counsel for the defence submitted that there was no case for the accused to answer.

24     The evidential threshold which the prosecution has to cross at the close of its case is well-established i.e. the prosecution has only to establish that there is _some evidence, which is not inherently incredible_, satisfying each and every element of the charge. This test is statutorily enshrined in s 230(1)(_j_) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) as follows:

> “if after considering the evidence referred to in paragraph (e), the court is of the view that there is _some evidence which is not inherently incredible and which satisfies each and every element of the charge_ as framed by the prosecutor or as altered or framed by the court, _the court_ _must_ _call on the accused to give his defence;_”

> \[emphasis added\]

25     In _Haw Tua Tau v Public Prosecutor_ \[1981-1982\] SLR(R) 133, which is the seminal case regarding the test to be applied at the close of the prosecution’s case, the Privy Council explained at \[17\] that, at the close of the prosecution’s case, the court was not obliged to conclude whether the accused’s guilt had been proven beyond reasonable doubt. In order to determine if the defence ought to be called, the court must act on two presumptions (at \[15\]):

> (a)     that all evidence of the primary facts is true, unless it is inherently so incredible that no reasonable person would accept it as being true; and

> (b)     that there will be nothing to displace those inferences as to further facts or to the state of the accused’s mind which would reasonably be drawn from the primary facts in the absence of any further explanation.

26     It is only if the evidence of the witnesses upon whom the prosecution’s case depended was “_so self-contradictory and out of all common sense or reason_” that the court is entitled to reach the conclusion that there is no evidence to support an essential ingredient in the charge: _Public Prosecutor v IC Automation (S) Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 2 SLR(R) 799</span> at \[17\].

27     Counsel’s submission of no case was “on the basis that the crucial element of intention has not been made out.”[^25] I rejected this one-line submission for two simple reasons.

28     First of all, counsel was misconceived as to the specific _mens rea_ in respect of the charge i.e. the stated _mens rea_ was not that the accused had _intended_ to outrage the victim’s modesty but rather that he touched her _knowing it to be likely_ that he would outrage her modesty. Secondly, there was evidence of the primary fact (which was not even denied) that the accused had touched the breast of the victim and there was also evidence from the victim (albeit not essential to the charge) that she felt that her modesty had been outraged. As such, the _mens rea_ element (i.e. that he knew that his act was likely to outrage the victim’s modesty) may reasonably be inferred from the primary fact that he touched the victim’s breast.

29     I was satisfied that there was some evidence which is not inherently incredible to support all the elements of the molest charge. This was not a case where the victim’s evidence was so self-contradictory and outside of all common sense or reason that I should reject the prosecution’s case at this juncture. Hence, I was satisfied, at this stage of the proceedings, that there was a _prima facie_ case for the accused to answer. I therefore called on him to enter his defence to the charge.

**The Defence**

30     The accused gave evidence in his defence. His evidence is summarised in the defence’s closing submission.[^26] That morning, he left his home at Silat Avenue and headed to a coffeeshop near Telok Blangah MRT station to have breakfast. He patronised this coffee-shop occasionally. He went there alone. After breakfast, he proceeded to the bus-stop and boarded the bus at the same time as the victim. He was taking the bus to go home. The accused knew that he had to tap his EZ link card on the card reader to pay the bus fare. He did so when he boarded the bus.

31     The accused does not deny touching the victim’s breast.[^27] However, he did so with his EZ link card and it was accidental.[^28] He had boarded the bus but did not tap his card properly on the card reader. He then returned to the front of the bus when the bus driver called out to him. He had to pass another passenger whom he referred to as “the big guy” before coming face to face with the victim.[^29] The accused’s focus was on the card reader and not the victim. He accidentally touched the victim and then proceeded to tap his card on the second card reader. He then moved towards the front door of the bus but he was not trying to leave the bus.[^30]

## Court’s Findings and Reasons

32     As noted above, the accused does not deny that he touched the victim’s breast over her clothes, except that he touched her with his card and not with the back of his hand. He also claimed in his defence that the touch was accidental i.e. unintentional.

33     The only material question in this case, to my mind, is whether the accused touched the victim’s breast accidentally. If it was not an accidental touch, as asserted by the accused, then the offence of outraging the victim’s modesty would be made out regardless of whether the contact was by way of his card or the back of his hand. In other words, if he had intended to touch her breast, regardless of whether he did so with his card or the back of his hand, it would be reasonably inferred from the nature of his act that he knew that it would be likely to outrage the victim’s modesty. As I will elaborate below, I found that the accused had touched the victim with the back of his hand and not with his card and that he did so intentionally.

#### Assessing credibility of victims of sexual offences

34     At the outset, I was of the view that the “unusually convincing” standard in respect of the testimony of a victim of a sexual offence did not apply in the present case. That evidential standard is normally required for cases of sexual offences because, as was observed in _Goh Han Heng v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 4 SLR(R) 374</span> at \[28\] that “_there is no class of offences in which fabrication is so easy and refutation so difficult as in the arena of sexual offences as all that the court has before it are very often the word of the victim against the denials of the accused_.” However, it was also held by Kannan J in _Ng Kum Weng v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 100</span> at \[44\], citing _Public Prosecutor v CGK and another matter_ \[2020\] 1 SLR 486GCK at \[89\] – \[90\] that this standard applies where there is no corroborative evidence and the testimony of the victim forms the sole basis of the conviction. That is not the case before this court.

35     In the present case, the victim’s evidence was fully corroborated by (i) the evidence of the bus driver who witnessed the offence and (ii) the objective evidence of the CCTV footage. I shall elaborate on these aspects below. In addition, the accused also does not deny touching the victim’s breast. In other words, this was _not_ a case where there is a possibility and danger that the victim could have entirely made up the allegation of molest and whose testimony therefore required a high level of scrutiny because of the absence of other corroborative evidence.

36     It is also trite law that there is no universal list of checkboxes to be ticked or standard yardstick to be used to assess how a victim of a sex crime is expected to behave: _GBR v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 296</span> (“GBR”) at \[13\] and \[20\]; _Public Prosecutor v BDA_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 72</span> at \[39\]. In essence, the Court must consider whether the victim’s response(s) to the sexual offence was within the realm of possibilities, and whether the victim is able to provide intelligible explanations for her reaction or lack thereof.

#### Victim’s evidence accepted

37     The victim testified that she did not believe that it was an accidental touch. I believed her evidence which was, as I will explain below, also consistent with the evidence of the bus driver and borne out by the CCTV footage. I found the victim to be a truthful and reliable witness who was able to provide a textured account of the incident with remarkable accuracy and consistency. She was direct and forthcoming with her answers which were clear, credible and coherent. The prosecution rightly pointed out that when it was suggested by counsel to her that the accused’s intention was to tap his card on the card reader and not to molest her, she candidly replied that she was not sure. I therefore agree with the prosecution and find that she was an objective witness and not presumptuous as to the guilty intentions of the accused.[^31] Her apparent uncertainly as to that particular suggestion is explained below.

38     I also agree with the prosecution that the victim could not be faulted for not being able to recall all that was said between the bus driver, the accused and her given the passage of time of about three years since the offence. As noted by the Court of Appeal in _Sandz Solutions (Singapore) Pte Ltd and others v Strategic Worldwide Assets Ltd and others_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 3 SLR 562</span> at \[56\], a witness ought not to be assessed to be less credible merely because of gaps in his or her memory, particularly where a long period of time has passed since the occurrence of the events in question. I accept that human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection is both common and understandable (_Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 45</span> at \[82\]) and that there will be minor differences each time a victim is asked to recount the offence, such as the inclusion of different details based on what the victim remembers. In assessing the credibility of a witness, what is more important are the material issues to be determined and not the minor details which are immaterial to the charge: _Ong Ting Ting v Public Prosecutor_ \[2004\] 4 SLR (R) 53 at \[30\] and \[31\]).

39     I believed the victim’s explanation as to why she felt that the touch was not accidental. She testified that she felt a significant amount of pressure on her left breast despite the fact that she was wearing a brassiere. In other words, she was able to feel the accused’s touch through an additional layer of undergarment. The feeling was consistent with pressure being exerted with the back of the accused’s hand.[^32] The victim explained further that had it been a light contact, she would not have been able to feel his hand.[^33] She testified that she immediately reacted to and protested against the accused touching her by shouting at the accused, hitting the back of his left shoulder, and pointing her index finger at him.[^34] The touch was so obviously inappropriate that there was no hesitation at all on her part to call out the accused.

40     I also accepted her evidence that the accused touched her with his hand and not with his EZ link card. Thus, she firmly disagreed with counsel’s suggestion that the accused touched her using his EZ link card.[^35]

41     I disagree with counsel’s submission that during cross-examination, the victim said she was unsure whether the accused had intended to molest her.[^36] I set out counsel’s only question to the victim regarding the accused’s intention and her response as follows to provide the entire context:[^37]

> Q    The---the accused’s intention at that point in time when he boarded the bus or when---sorry, when he made his way towards the front of the bus, was to tap the card again on the machine---on the EZ-link machine on board the bus and not to molest you. Do you agree or disagree?

> A    I’m not sure..

As may be seen, the question was rather convoluted and comprised of several parts. Counsel asked about the accused’s intention at two different points in time i.e. when he first boarded the bus and when he was returning back to the front of the bus to tap his card on the card reader. Counsel also provided the victim a binary option i.e. whether the accused had intended to tap his card _or_ to molest the victim, when in reality, the accused may well have intended both actions albeit to be committed sequentially. In other words, both intentions are not mutually exclusive. Therefore, it was not a fair question and one which the victim could not be faulted for being unsure as what her answer should be. Furthermore, counsel did not give the victim any opportunity to explain or elaborate further. I should also add, as I will shortly point out below, that counsel was also misconceived about the _mens rea_ as stated in the charge.

42     I further accepted the victim’s evidence that she experienced both short-term and long-term trauma arising from being molested by the accused. The immediate effect on the victim following the offence was that she felt very angry and overwhelmed, and she also shivered due to the adrenaline rush.[^38] Even after the police had arrived at the scene, she was afraid and avoided looking at the accused.[^39] In the three years since the incident, the victim no longer commutes alone by bus to the vicinity of the incident for fear of bumping into the accused. She also does not wear the blouse that she wore on the day of the offence because it reminded her of the incident.[^40]

43     I had observed the victim’s demeanour and considered her evidence in totality. I agree with the prosecution’s submission that she came across as a level-headed and mature young woman who was not prone to dramatics or exaggeration. I find that her reactions and feelings in relation to the offence were credible, reasonable and certainly well within the realm of possibilities. I had no difficulty believing her and accepting her testimony.

#### Victim’s evidence corroborated

44     I accepted the victim’s explanation that it was not an accidental touch also because her evidence was externally consistent with the objective evidence of the CCTV footage. Her immediate reaction of shock the very next second after she was touched was captured and plainly seen on the CCTV footage.[^41] She spun round immediately to confront the accused who pretended as if nothing had happened. The fact that she felt a significant degree of pressure on her breast which is more probative of an intentional touch is evident from her immediate reaction of shock which is plainly seen on the CCTV footage.

45     The amount pressure that she felt on her breast is also caused, as clearly seen on the footage, by the accused’s hand which continued to be raised and in contact with the victim’s chest even when he was walking past and abreast of her, resulting in his arm being in an almost awkward position.[^42] In my view, this strongly suggested of two things. First, the accused intended to touch the victim and therefore he maintained contact with her breast for longer than if it had been an accident. Second, there would have been a forward pressure being exerted against the victim’s breast as the accused walked past her which accounted for the significant pressure that the victim felt.

46     I also considered that the victim’s feelings of outrage were very much consistent with the WhatsApp text exchange with her friend, Tan. It was not in dispute that the victim texted Tan at the scene itself providing a contemporaneous record of the fact that the accused had molested her.

47     The victim’s account of the offence is also entirely corroborated by the evidence of the bus driver who had witnessed the incident.[^43] He testified unhesitatingly that the accused’s act was deliberate and could not have been accidental.[^44] He maintained resolutely when cross-examined that it was not an accident as follows:[^45]

> Q    Therefore, could there had been an accident?

> A    Based on what I witnessed at that point \[in\] time, it was not an accident. It was intentional. I felt that it was intentional.

48     I accepted his objective and logical explanation that given the adequate space between the accused and the victim, the accused’s extension of his left hand towards the victim’s breast could not have been an accident. I also accepted his evidence, as clearly captured by the CCTV, that he closed the front door of the bus to stop the accused from trying to alight from the bus. Further, as rightly pointed out by the prosecution, it was not put to the bus driver that he was mistaken that that the accused’s act of touching the victim was unintentional.

49     Contrary to counsel’s submission[^46], there was no contradiction between the victim’s testimony and that of the bus driver. Whilst she remembered asking the bus driver whether he saw the accused touching her, she did not remember his reply. Her inability to recall what the bus driver said is immaterial and does not detract from the fact that the bus driver did in fact witness the accused touching the victim and testifying that he did. In any event, the primary fact that the accused did touch the victim is not denied.

#### No motive to lie

50     I agree with prosecution’s submission that both the victim and the bus driver, who was undoubtedly an independent witness, had no reason or motive whatsoever to lie in their evidence. It was not disputed that all three parties do not know and had never seen one another prior to the offence. In other words, they were complete strangers. There was in fact no suggestion that the victim or the bus driver bore any grudge or ill-will against the accused. It was entirely improbable that the victim and the bus driver would have decided there and then to pick on and frame the accused for molesting the victim.

51     I also accept that the victim and the bus driver had nothing to gain by calling out the accused for the offence. On the contrary, they were both inconvenienced having had their respective morning schedules interrupted and having to assist with the investigations thereafter. I was satisfied that they were both truthful witnesses.

## Accused’s Defence Rejected

#### Touched with back of hand

52     I rejected the accused’s defence that he made contact with the victim only with his EZ link card. I accepted the victim’s testimony that the accused touched her breast with the back of his hand. He was also holding his EZ link card which explains why he touched her with the back of his hand but it was intentional nonetheless.

53     As held above, I believed her testimony that she felt the back of someone’s hand touch her left breast and that there was “_a significant amount of pressure_” for about one second as the accused walked past her. She felt the significant pressure concentrated on her left breast when the accused brushed the back of his hand against her breast.[^47]

54     It could also be seen from the CCTV footage that the entire hand came into contact with the victim’s chest, and not merely the EZ link card. Even if it was just the EZ link card (which was not the case), the offence would also be made out if the touch was intentional, as it was in this case.

55     In either scenario (be it the hand or the EZ link card), there was certainly contact with a significant amount of pressure against the victim’s breast. Consequently, I rejected the defence’s argument that there was no use of “criminal force.”[^48] Counsel is misconceived as to what constitutes “criminal force” as the term is used in the Penal Code. “Criminal force” is defined in s 350 of the Penal Code simply as a force which is intentionally used against a person (the victim in this case) without the person’s consent. A person (the accused in this case) is said to use force against the victim if he _inter alia_ “causes motion, change of motion or cessation of motion_”_ to the victim. Therefore, there need not even be actual physical contact for an act to amount to the using of force against another person. In the present case, there was certainly actual physical contact between the accused’s hand and the victim’s chest and such contact was without the victim’s consent. The contact was in fact so sustained and strong that it stopped the victim in her tracks and caused her to turn towards the accused. There was no question in my mind that the accused had used criminal force on the victim.

#### Not an accident

56     As highlighted by the prosecution, the accused explained his defence of accident as follows: (a) that he wanted to avoid the “big man” or “big guy” who was ahead of the victim and also walking towards him[^49]; and (b) that he had intended to tap his EZ link card on the card reader but missed and touched the victim’s breast instead by accident.

57     Apart from the victim’s evidence, which is corroborated by the bus driver, that it could not have been an accident, I also concluded that the accused’s defence of accident is not tenable in light of the following five observations.

58     The first observation is that the accused was already eyeing the victim when he boarded the bus. This was captured in the CCTV footage when the victim boarded the bus just ahead of the accused. As she was standing next to the bus driver rummaging through her bag for her EZ link card, the accused was staring at her before he turned to tap his card on the second card reader across the aisle.[^50] He would have no reason to stare at her if not for the fact that she had caught his attention.

59     My second observation is that as the accused was returning to the front of the bus, he had to walk past two passengers (i.e. the big guy and then the victim) before he could tap his EZ link card on the second card reader. I observed from the video footage that the accused person raised his left hand (holding the EZ link card) after walking past the big guy but _before_ passing the victim. He literally thrusted his hand into the chest of the victim and continued to press against her breast even as he was walking past her.[^51] That accounted for the significant amount of pressure felt by the victim. If his intention was purely to tap his card on the card reader, he would and should have only raised his hand _after_ passing both the big guy and the victim. The accused had the presence of mind not to raise his hand as he was walking past the big guy but chose to raise and stretch out his hand to touch the victim as they were both walking towards each other. He waited till _after_ passing the big guy before stretching out his hand as the victim was walking towards him. He was clearly aiming for her chest. The card reader was not even within his reach . the card reader because the carnot the card reader which was behind the victim. It was clearly a deliberate and calculated act on the part of the accused and not a momentary or accidental touch.

60     The accused’s evidence with respect to the big guy is also incomprehensible. He acknowledged when questioned by the learned DPP that he had already walked past the big guy at the 9.32.25 a.m. mark of the CCTV footage. Yet, at the 9.32.26 a.m. point of the CCTV footage, the accused said that as he walked past the victim, he stretched out his hand towards the victim _“to avoid the big man._**_”_**[^52] As rightly pointed out by the prosecution in its submission, this made no logical sense because the big guy was already behind him. The only conclusion to be drawn is that the accused stretched out his hand intending to touch the victim’s breast. It was not to tap his card on the card reader because if that had been his intention, he would have raised his hand only _after_ walking past the victim.

61     My third observation is that the accused used his right hand to tap on the card reader when he first boarded the bus (i.e. before the offence)[^53]_and_ he used his right hand again when he was explaining and demonstrating to the bus driver that he was merely trying to tap his card on the same card reader (i.e. after the offence)[^54]. Yet, he had used his left hand to touch the victim in his alleged “attempt” to tap on the card reader.[^55] Had he used his right hand to tap the card reader, which appeared to be what he would normally do, his right hand would not have made any contact with the victim’s chest because the victim would be walking past on his left. Therefore, it was a conscious and deliberate choice to use his left hand because he would then be able to touch the victim who would be walking past his left.

62     I have already mentioned my fourth observation earlier on in these grounds and this relates to the duration of and the manner in which the accused touched the victim’s breast as captured on the CCTV footage, which strongly suggest that it was not an accident. As highlighted above, the accused’s arm continued to be raised and his hand remained in contact with the victim’s chest even when he was walking past and abreast of her, resulting in his arm being in an almost awkward position.[^56] I find that the contact could not have been more obvious and intentional. He raised his hand to touch her breast and made no attempt to retract his hand even as he was walking past her.

63     The fifth observation is that the accused did not immediately apologise to the victim for touching her. In light of my fourth observation (regarding the duration of the contact and the way his hand had connected with her chest area), there is no doubt that the accused would have been aware that he had touched the victim, accidental or otherwise. If it was an accidental touch, he would have apologised immediately and in tandem with the victim’s shocked reaction. Instead, he pretended as if nothing had happened and did not acknowledge that he had touched the victim until he was confronted by her. He was obviously feigning ignorance in the hope that the victim would not be brave enough to confront him.

#### No causal or contributory link

64     The defence submitted that the accused suffers from Schizophrenia and appeared to suggest that he was having disorganised behaviour and thoughts (which are symptoms of Schizophrenia) at the time of the incident, which may have resulted in him accidentally touching the victim.[^57]

65     At the outset, I did not agree with prosecution’s submission that the accused’s primary defence that it was an accident is necessarily incongruent with the defence of Schizophrenia. I understood the defence’s contention is that the accused was exhibiting symptom of Schizophrenia in the form of disorganised thought and behaviour and as a consequence, he unintentionally touched the victim. I did not think that both defences were mutually exclusive and therefore inconsistent with one another. Having said that, I do agree with the prosecution that both contentions are unmeritorious and contradicted by the evidence. Accordingly, I rejected both these defences.

66     I accepted the psychiatrist’s evidence and opinion that the accused was stable and clear minded at the material time of the offence and that he was not of unsound mind. Despite his condition which is chronic and even if he was not taking his medications, the psychiatrist testified that the accused would not relapse and would remain symptom free if there was no duress or stressors. The psychiatrist had also confirmed with the accused’s sister that the accused was thinking clearly that morning before the time of the offence. The learned DPP also meticulously got the accused to recount and account for his movements and thoughts that morning leading up to his encounter with the victim. The evidence of the arresting officers also suggest that the accused was stable even after his arrest and during the ride back to the police station.

67     Based on the accused’s account of the sequence of events that morning, the psychiatrist was of the opinion that there was no significant disorganized thinking or behaviour at the time of the offence and that the accused knew what was going on. There was nothing to suggest that the accused was behaving or thinking in a disorganised manner prior to the offence. In any event, the psychiatrist testified that any symptoms of Schizophrenia the accused may or may not have had at that time had not in any way diminished his awareness of the situation.[^58]

68     The day after his arrest, the accused appeared to have exhibited some formal thought disorder, according to hospital notes. However, the psychiatrist explained that the accused’s Schizophrenia was likely exacerbated by his arrest and the stress arising from his admission into IMH.[^59] The psychiatrist further explained that the accused’s Schizophrenic symptoms may also have been triggered by the stress caused by him being caught committing an offence and the police being called.[^60] In any case, even if the symptoms of Schizophrenia were triggered, these occurred after the commission of the offence and had no bearing on his culpability for the offence itself.

69     In summary, I accepted his conclusion that the accused’s diagnosed condition of Schizophrenia did not cause or contribute to the accused’s commission of the offence.[^61] The defence did not adduce any psychiatric assessment or expert evidence to the contrary. Accordingly, I was satisfied and I found that there was no causal or contributory link between the accused’s condition of Schizophrenia and his commission of the offence.

## Conclusion

70     I accepted the victim’s testimony which was fully corroborated by the independent evidence of the bus driver. The victim’s account was also consistent with her immediate reaction and the contemporaneous messages which she exchanged with her friend.

71     On the other hand, I rejected the accused’s defence that it was an accident. From my study and observations of the CCTV footage, I found that the accused had intentionally and deliberately touched the victim’s breast. He did so knowing, at the very least, that his act would likely outrage the victim’s modesty. I was also satisfied that the victim’s modesty was in fact outraged.

72     I also found that the accused was not suffering from any symptoms of Schizophrenia when he committed the offence. Therefore, there was no causal or contributory link between his condition of Schizophrenia and his commission of the offence.

73     In conclusion, I found that the prosecution had proved the molest charge against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. I convicted the accused of the charge accordingly.
