Damages – Assessment

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in HC/RAS 1/2022.\]

18 February 2022 - Judgment reserved.

### District Judge Toh Yung Cheong:

## Introduction

1       The plaintiff (“P”) was injured in a motor accident on 27 December 2010. On 3 April 2013, he was involved in another motor accident and also suffered injuries. In both cases, the car he was driving was rear-ended while momentarily stationary. He filed claims in respect of both accidents (referred to as “RTA1” and “RTA2” respectively) for the injuries and losses he suffered.

2       The suit in respect of RTA2 was settled while the suit in respect of RTA1 proceeded to an assessment of damages hearing where the Deputy Registrar awarded the plaintiff the following damages:

3       The plaintiff appealed against the DR’s decision.

## Application to amend Statement of Claim in respect of pre-trial medical expenses

4       The DR in his Grounds of Decision noted that the plaintiff, in his statement of special damages annexed to the statement of claim, claimed $24,007.30 in pre-writ medical expenses. However, P enlarged this claim to $30,913.44 in his closing submissions. The DR explained in his GD that he would have been prepared to allow a claim for a sum of at least $30,631.24. However, the DR limited the award to $24,007.30 since special damages must be strictly pleaded.[^1]

> (a)     Before the hearing of the Registrar’s Appeal, the plaintiff applied to amend the statement of special damages annexed to his claim. I allowed the application after a separate hearing.

## Registrar’s Appeal

5       I allowed the plaintiff’s appeal in relation to pre-trial medical expenses in light of my decision to allow the plaintiff to amend the statement of claim.

6       Apart from this, the plaintiff’s appeal was dismissed. The plaintiff has appealed against my decision and I will now set out the reasons for my decision.

## Plaintiff’s Appeal

7       I will deal with the plaintiff’s appeal in the following order:

> (a)     Part I: General Damages for pain and suffering:

>> (i)       Grade 3 whiplash with associated spinal injuries.

>> (ii)       Adjustment disorder with depressed mood; insomnia.

> (b)     Part II: Medical/ Transport-related losses:

>> (i)       Pre-trial medical/transport claims.

>> (ii)       Future Medical Expenses.

> (c)     Part III: Income-related losses

>> (i)       Pre-AD loss of earnings.

>> (ii)       Loss of future earnings / loss of earnings capacity.

## Part I: General Damages for pain and suffering

### Grade 3 Whiplash injury and associated spinal injuries

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="33.7132573485303%"> <col width="33.6932613477305%"> <col width="32.5934813037393%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">P’s Submission</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">D’s Submission</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">DR’s award</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$25,000</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$8,000</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$18,000</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

8       The DR awarded $18,000 for a Grade 3 whiplash injury and associated spinal injuries. In making the award, the DR took the position that half of P’s symptoms post-RTA2 were attributable to RTA2. Therefore, the award was compensation only for the pain and suffering from whiplash that was attributable to RTA1.[^2]

9       The plaintiff’s position is that RTA2 had little impact on P’s injury in RTA1 whereas the defendant submitted that the damages should be reduced.

10     I agreed with the DR’s approach and noted that he had carefully scrutinised the medical evidence before coming to his decision. In particular, the DR took note of P’s hospitalisation, the amount of medical leave granted, the dosage and cost of his medication, and P’s claim that he was not able to drive a taxi after RTA2. This can be contrasted to P’s condition immediately before RTA2, where P had recovered sufficiently to be able to drive a taxi.

11     While the medical experts could not quantitatively apportion the effects of RTA1 and RTA2, there was nevertheless sufficient evidence for the DR to find that RTA2 was a serious accident.

12     Given the evidence of the substantial impact of RTA2, the DR’s decision to consider half of the plaintiff’s post-RTA2 symptoms as attributable to RTA1 was extremely fair to the plaintiff.

13     Moving from a consideration of the DR’s approach to the quantum of the award, I am of the view that DR’s award correctly reflects the seriousness of the injury. Despite there being some medical evidence that P suffered from Grade 3 whiplash, the DR did not simply rely on the diagnostic label and went further to take into account the relatively more serious symptoms suffered by P. I also noted that the $18,000 award was within the range in the _Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases (Academy Publishing 2010)_ for Grade 4 whiplash and severe whiplash injuries. Therefore, I dismissed P’s appeal against this award.

### Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood; Insomnia

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="33.8132373525295%"> <col width="33.8132373525295%"> <col width="32.373525294941%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">P’s Submission</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">D’s Submission</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">DR’s award</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$12,000</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">-</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$6,000</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

#### P’s submission on Appeal

14     P is appealing against the DR’s award of $6,000 in damages for insomnia and adjustment disorder with depressed mood. P submitted on appeal that the DR erred in finding that while RTA1 contributed to P’s adjustment disorder, D should only be liable to half of P’s post-RTA2 pain and suffering.[^3]

15     P submitted that this finding was not justified as P’s complaints and symptoms existed before RTA2 and did not worsen after RTA2.[^4]

#### Decision

16     The basis for submitting that P’s condition had not worsened was that the “Plaintiff’s complaints regarding his psychological condition were largely similar before and after the 2nd accident.” However, the fact that the complaints were similar in nature is not sufficient to establish that the symptoms did not get more severe after RTA2.

17     I agreed with the DR that the evidence showed that P’s condition worsened after RTA2 and D should only be liable to half of P’s post-RTA2 pain and suffering. In arriving at this finding, I noted that:

> (a)     P’s diagnosis for adjustment disorder with depressed mood was only made 8.5 months after RTA2 which suggests that his condition may have worsened after RTA2 to the extent that it fit the diagnostic criteria for the condition.

> (b)     After P started working as a taxi driver in 2012, P defaulted on his appointments of psychiatry and psychology without good reason. This suggests that since he had a relatively stable source of income as a taxi driver, the symptoms he had reported had lessened to the extent that he did not see a need to seek medical help for them.

## Part II: Medical and Transport Expenses

### Pre-trial Medical Expenses

18     As I had allowed P’s application to amend the Statement of Special Damages, I am awarding P $30,631.24 for medical expenses for the period 27 Dec 2010 to 27 Sep 2012.

19     For the reasons stated earlier concerning the seriousness of RTA2 and its impact on the plaintiff, I agreed with the DR’s approach to award P half of the post-RTA2 medical expenses used to treat P’s injuries that are not clearly attributable to RTA2.[^5]

### Future Medical Expenses

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="33.5%"> <col width="33.52%"> <col width="32.98%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">P’s Submission</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">D’s Submission</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">DR’s award</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$56,304</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$1,000</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$2,484.13</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

20     I dismissed P’s appeal against the DR’s award of $2,484.13 for future medical expenses.

#### P’s submission

21     The plaintiff’s claim of $56,304 for future medical expenses was based on $276.00/month x 12 months/year x 17 (being the multiplier considering P’s 36-year remaining life expectancy). At the hearing of the appeal, the plaintiff put forward an alternative sum of $8,721 ($513 x multiplier of 17 years).[^6]

#### Court’s finding on future medical expenses

22     I agreed with the DR’s approach in looking at:

> (a)     The historical cost of the medication (Gabapentin, Paracetamol, Eperisone, HCl, and Glucosamine) that was given to P as well as whether the cost of medication was increasing or decreasing.

> (b)     How frequently the medication was dispensed.

23     Given that the medication was only dispensed once a year in 2018 and 2019 (and twice in 2017), I agreed with the DR’s decision:

> (a)     To make an award on the basis that P would require medication and an accompanying consultation once a year.

> (b)     To peg the cost of medication at $266.45 and the cost of consultation at $25.80 based on P’s historical costs.

24     On the basis that half of P’s pain and suffering for his whiplash is attributable to RTA2, I agreed with the DR that it would be wrong for D1 to bear the entire cost of P’s future medical expenses and agreed with the 50% deduction applied by the DR.

### Pre-trial and future Transport Expenses

25     I dismissed P’s appeal against the DR’s award of $490 for pre-trial and $42.50 for future transport expenses.

#### Plaintiff’s submission

26     P does not dispute the fact that there was no documentary proof regarding P’s transport expense. However, P cites the case of _Tan Hun Boon v Rui Feng Travel Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 244</span> where Judicial Commission Pang Khang Chau (as he then was) gave a global award $3,000 for future transport expenses which were estimated to amount to 101 trips over 18 years.

#### Defendant’s submission

27     D disputes this head of claim as it is an item of special damages which was not proven by taxi receipts.

#### Findings

28     As a starting point, I agreed with the DR that P should be awarded pre-trial transport expenses for 107 trips to the hospital comprising 89 trips before RTA2 and 18 trips after RTA2.

29     Given the lack of evidence as to the transport expenses incurred, I agreed with the DR’s approach to peg the amount per trip at $5. P was entitled to these expenses and even if there were no receipts, the cost of transport would not have been zero. I also noted that some of these trips took place when P was working as a taxi driver.

30     As for future transport expenses, I agreed with the DR’s decision to peg it at $5 per trip in the absence of other evidence. While I noted that a different figure was used in _Tan Hun Boon v Rui Feng Travel Pte Ltd and another_, the plaintiff in _Tan Hun Boon_ suffered an above-knee amputation and severe phantom limb pain. His transport options may therefore have been more limited than the present plaintiff, whom the doctors have indicated was able to drive a private hire vehicle.

31     However, in the recently released decision of _Krishnamoorthy s/o Chellappan v Ramasamy Arivazhagan_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 283</span>, the Deputy Registrar in that case at \[108\] applied _Tan Hun Boon_ in calculating the plaintiff’s claim for transport expenses in the absence of any receipts.

32     As for the number of trips that will form the basis of the award for future transport expenses, this is linked to the DR’s finding that P requires medical consultations only once a year with a 17-year multiplier.[^7]

### Pre-trial loss of earnings

33     P is appealing against the DR’s decision in relation to pre-trial loss of earnings for the following periods:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="32.64%"> <col width="34.06%"> <col width="33.3%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Dates</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DR’s description</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DR’s award expressed in terms of months of salary</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">22 Feb 2012-3 Jun 2012</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">“Period 2”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">P was unemployed but not on medical leave (Pre-RTA2)</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">During this period, to took a taxi vocational course</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2.5 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1 Feb 2015-31 May 2017</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">“Period 6B”</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1 Jun 2017-31 Dec 2017</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">“Period 7”</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">31 Jan 2018-30 Sep 2019</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">P was not employed</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">He made some attempts to secure employment between Jun 2015-Feb 2016</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(post-RTA2)</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">8 months</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

#### Period 2

34     During period 2 (22 Feb 2012-3 Jun 2012), which was before RTA2, the accused not on medical leave but he was not employed. During this period, P obtained a taxi vocational licence. The DR’s award of 2.5 months took into account the 1.5 months typically needed to obtain a taxi vocational licence and a further month beyond his medical leave to look for better-paying employment.

35     I agreed with the DR’s finding that apart from the 2.5 months which the DR had identified, P had not shown that he was actively looking for work. As the defence pointed out, P would have known that his lengthy medical leave would be coming to an end in February 2012. He ought to have asked his doctors what alternative work he could undertake and he could have sought alternative employment. During cross-examination, P appeared uncertain whether he received any advice from his doctors as to what jobs he could do, though he claimed that he was told what jobs he could _not_ do.[^9] Therefore, P was not entitled to any further award for loss of earnings for period 2.

#### Periods 6B, 7, and 8

36     P quit his job as a car wash supervisor in Jan 2015 and was unemployed for periods 6B, 7, and 8. This was a period amounting to three and a half years which would normally have been sufficient time to secure gainful employment.

37     The DR accepted that in June 2015, P was in touch with the Workforce Development Agency (“WDA”) and registered for a programme which ran from late October 2015 to late Feb 2016. The DR was prepared to accept that P was actively seeking employment during this entire period and made an award for pre-trial loss of earnings for the period of June 2015 to February 2016.

38     The DR had the benefit of hearing P’s evidence from the witness box and did not accept P’s assertion that he was actively looking for work for the entire period. P did not provide any satisfactory evidence from the witness box and did not produce any evidence (apart from the evidence regarding the WDA course) to show that he was taking steps to secure employment.

39     I agreed with the DR’s assessment of the evidence and found that apart from the 8-month period when he was in contact with the WDA, there was insufficient evidence to show that P was actively seeking employment.

40     I also agreed with the DR’s finding that after P completed his WDA course, he chose not to return to work. The evidence of the Doctors is that the accused could at a minimum engage in sedentary work. Dr James Tan testified that he had encouraged P to work that there was no reason why P could not work though he should avoid exertion and loading of the spine.[^10] Dr Tan stated that P could be an NTUC cashier or return to being a taxi or private-hire car driver, on the basis that such drivers had the flexibility to take breaks where necessary[^11].

41     Given the finding that P had chosen not to work, I also agreed with the DR that no award should be made for the period June to December 2017, the period for which Dr James Tan had certified P temporarily unfit for work.

42     P referred to the case of _Ho Yiu v Lim Peng Seng_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 4 SLR 675</span> where the High Court made a loss of earnings award based on the difference between what the plaintiff should have earned in mitigation and his pre-accident salary. However, the case is distinguishable as there was no finding that the plaintiff in Ho Yiu had chosen not to work. Instead, the inability of the plaintiff to find pre-trial employment was due to medical reasons. Justice Judith Prakash (as she then was), stated at \[28\]:

> Whilst I accept that the plaintiff had the qualifications to carry out the job of an accounts service executive, he was handicapped in this by the need to see doctors frequently to deal with the various continuing consequences of his accident. In view of these problems, it would not have been realistic at that time for the plaintiff to obtain such a job.

43     Finally, I agreed with the DR that for the award of pre-trial loss of earnings for the period after RTA2 where P was actively seeking work, the present defendant is liable to the extent that RTA1 prevented P from working as a mechanic. RTA1 did not prevent P from working as a taxi driver. Therefore, I accepted that the award should be ($2,875 minus $1,000) x 8 months, which represents the difference between P’s income as a mechanic and his income as a taxi driver.

### General Principles

44     To make out a claim for loss of future earnings (“LFE”), the plaintiff is required to adduce evidence that he will suffer loss of future earnings: _Teo Sing Keng v Sim Ban Kiat_ <span class="citation">\[1994\] 1 SLR(R) 340</span> at \[38\] and _Chai Kang Wei Samuel v Shaw Linda Gillian_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 3 SLR 587</span> at \[19\].

45     In respect of Loss of Earning Capacity (“LEC”), the Court of Appeal in _Chai Kang Wei Samuel v Shaw Linda Gillian_ noted at \[20\] that LEC compensates for the risk or disadvantage, which the plaintiff would suffer in the event that he or she should lose the job that he or she currently holds, in securing an equivalent job in the open employment market.

46     If the plaintiff is employed at the time of the hearing of assessment of damages, the Court will usually proceed on the basis that the plaintiff will continue to work until the statutory retirement age, subject to any evidence to the contrary. On the other hand, if the plaintiff is not working at the time of the hearing because he is still on medical leave, the Court may similarly presume that the plaintiff would want to resume work once his medical leave is over.

47     In _Lim Xueru & Anor v Lim Kai Meng_ <span class="citation">\[1992\] 3 SLR(R) 183</span>, the plaintiff had stopped work of her own volition but she planned to seek employment 12 to 13 years later after her children had grown up. The High Court at \[22\] agreed with the assistant registrar’s view that the plaintiff had no real intention to resume work in the immediate future and by the time she was ready to resume work, her injuries sustained would not be a handicap to her when she was ready to seek employment again in the future. As such, the High Court dismissed the plaintiff’s appeal against the assistant registrar’s decision not to award loss of earnings capacity.

### Decision on LFE /LEC

48     Returning to the present case, I noted that the Deputy Registrar, after hearing from the plaintiff in the witness box and after reviewing all the evidence, concluded that at the time of the assessment of damages hearing, the plaintiff had already chosen to stop work. There was also no evidence that he intended to resume working at a future date.

49     Given these findings, I agreed that P was not entitled to an award for LFE or LEC and I dismiss P’s appeal against the DR’s decision not to award LFE or LEC.

## Interest

50     P also appealed against the DR’s decision on interest.[^12] The DR provided detailed reasons at \[152\]-\[153\] and I agreed with the interest award. Therefore, I dismissed P’s appeal against the DR’s decision on interest.

## Conclusion

51     As I allowed the appeal against the DR’s award for pre-trial medical expenses and dismissed the remainder of the Plaintiff’s appeal, the revised total award is $154,579.86.

52     In light of my findings, it was not necessary for me to consider the additional issue of merger which was raised by the defence during the hearing of the appeal.
