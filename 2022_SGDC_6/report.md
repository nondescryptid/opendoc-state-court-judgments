### District Judge Kessler Soh:

## Introduction

1       The defendant is 27 years of age. At the material time he was married to a 30-year-old woman (the “**Victim**”). He suspected his wife of committing adultery. His suspicions were confirmed when he took her mobile phone out of her possession on 6 February 2020 and found intimate images and video recordings on the phone of her having sexual intercourse with her work supervisor (the “**Supervisor**”). Deeply upset about his wife’s infidelity, he posted an intimate image of the adulterous act on Facebook six days later, on 12 February 2020. The post quickly went viral, and it was shared and commented on by numerous Facebook users within the span of a few hours. The Supervisor, who was alerted to the post by a friend, lodged a police report the same day.

2       Following investigations, the defendant was charged with four offences. On a plea offer, he pleaded guilty to two charges. One charge was for theft of the Victim’s mobile phone, an offence under s 380 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (the “**Penal Code**”); the other charge was for distributing an image of the Victim having sexual intercourse with the Supervisor, having reason to believe that the distribution was likely to cause humiliation to the Victim, an offence under s 377BE(1) of the Penal Code. The remaining two charges, which were related to these incidents, were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

3       The plea was taken on 21 September 2021. The case underwent several adjournments for parties to tender submissions on the sentence. The prosecution sought a sentence of at least 18 months’ imprisonment; the defence suggested a sentence in the range of 5 to 7 weeks’ imprisonment. On 3 December 2021, the defendant was sentenced to a total of 13 weeks’ imprisonment. The sentence was deferred to allow time for parties to consider whether to appeal. On 8 December 2021, the prosecution filed the present appeal against the sentence. There was no cross-appeal by the defendant. The defendant is presently on bail pending the appeal.

4       The grounds of my decision on the sentence are set out below.

## Plea of Guilt

### Proceeded charges

5       The defendant pleaded guilty to two charges. One was a charge of theft, under s 380 of the Penal Code (DAC-904515-2021, the “**s 380 Charge**”):

> You \[…\] are charged that you, on or around 6 February 2020, at or about 1.00 pm, at \[the Victim’s home\], Singapore, a building used as a human dwelling, did commit theft of one Gold Coloured Samsung Mobile Phone in the possession of \[the Victim\], and have thereby committed an offence under Section 380 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

6       The other charge was for distributing an intimate image of the Victim, an offence under s 377BE(1) and punishable under s 377BE(3) of the Penal Code (DAC-904516-2021, the “**s 377BE(1) Charge**”):

> You \[…\] are charged that you, on or around 12 February 2020 at about 8.00 am in Singapore, intentionally distributed an intimate image of another person, namely \[the Victim\] without her consent, having reason to believe that the distribution is likely to cause her humiliation, to wit, you posted on Facebook the said intimate image of the victim with her face and breasts visible and doing a private act, namely engaging in sexual intercourse with \[the Supervisor\], and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 377BE(1) punishable under Section 377BE(3) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

7       Section 377BE(1) of the Penal Code (“**s 377BE(1)**”) provided as follows:

> 377BE.—(1) Any person (_A_) shall be guilty of an offence who —

>> (a)    intentionally or knowingly distributes an intimate image or recording of another person (_B_);

>> (b)    without _B_’s consent to the distribution; and

>> (c)    knows or has reason to believe that the distribution will or is likely to cause _B_ humiliation, alarm or distress.

8       The punishment is prescribed in s 377BE(3):

> Subject to subsection (4) \[which prescribes the punishment where _B_ is below 14 years of age\], a person who is guilty of an offence under subsection (1) or (2) shall on conviction be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 5 years, or with fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishments.

9       The phrase “intimate image or recording” is defined in s 377BE(5):

> “intimate image or recording”, in relation to a person (_B_) —

>> (a)    means an image or recording —

>>> (i)    of _B_’s genital or anal region, whether bare or covered by underwear;

>>> (ii)   of _B_’s breasts if B is female, whether bare or covered by underwear; or

>>> (iii)   of _B_ doing a private act; and

>> (b)    includes an image or recording, in any form, that has been altered to appear to show any of the things mentioned in paragraph (a) but excludes an image so altered that no reasonable person would believe that it depicts _B_.

### Facts

10     The salient facts were as follows.

#### Theft of Victim’s mobile phone

11     On 6 February 2020, the Victim was at home. The defendant came to the home and requested to use the toilet. (The defendant and the Victim were still married at that time, but he was no longer living there as he had moved out in December 2019.)

12     She allowed him to enter, and he used the toilet attached to the master bedroom. When he exited the toilet, he formed the dishonest intention to take her mobile phone. She was using her mobile phone in the master bedroom at that time. He took the mobile phone out of her possession and without her consent, and ran out of the home. She ran after him but was unable to catch up with him. He thus committed an offence under s 380 of the Penal Code.

13     The defendant took the Victim’s mobile phone as he suspected that she was having an affair. He accessed the mobile phone to look for pictures and messages so that he could confirm his suspicions. He found several intimate images and recordings of the Victim. He used his mobile phone to take photographs and video recordings of these images and videos. He thus came into possession of the following intimate image and recordings (which was the subject matter of a TIC charge: below, at \[19(a)\]):

> (a)     a four-second recording of the Victim’s bare breasts with her face partially visible;

> (b)     a 16-second recording of the Victim fully naked with her bare breasts and vagina fully visible; and

> (c)     an image of the Victim and the Supervisor engaging in sexual intercourse, with the Victim fully naked, her breasts visible, and the faces of the Supervisor and Victim fully visible (the “**Intimate Image**”).

14     After saving the image and recordings on his mobile phone, he went back to the Victim’s home about 15 to 30 minutes later to return the mobile phone to her. He did not tell her that he was in possession of the intimate image and recordings.

#### Distribution of intimate image of Victim

15     On 12 February 2020, at around 8 am, the defendant posted the Intimate Image (described at \[13(c)\]) on his Facebook page. (He said that he did so because he did not want others to share the same fate as him.) He set the post to “public” so that the post could be viewed by the public. In addition to the image, he included the Supervisor’s name and occupation in the post. He described the Supervisor as a homewrecker and warned people to be aware of him. There were other images in the post, including photographs of the Supervisor and screenshots of text conversations between the Supervisor and the Victim. (These screenshots were taken when the defendant took the Victim’s mobile phone on 6 February 2020.) The defendant thus intentionally distributed the Intimate Image of the Victim without her consent. He had reason to believe that the distribution was likely to cause the Victim humiliation.

16     At about 9 am that day, the Supervisor was informed by a friend about the post. He lodged a police report at about 12.44 pm. Separately, the Victim also received calls from her friends informing her that the defendant had made the Facebook post. The Victim was alarmed and felt humiliated.

17     The defendant’s post on Facebook went viral. At around 4 pm that day, the defendant accessed his Facebook account and saw that there were many comments and reactions on the post. There were about 1,000 comments on the post; the post was shared about 2,000 times by other Facebook users; there were about 3,000 “likes” on the post. The defendant did not expect the post to receive so much attention and he decided to remove it.

18     After removing the post, the defendant decided to create another Facebook post. He uploaded the same image with the Victim’s face blurred, while her breasts and the Supervisor’s face remained fully visible. He used the same Facebook account as the one he had used for the initial post. He posted this image because he wanted the public to know about what the Supervisor had done. This post was only removed one day later, and it was the subject matter of another TIC charge (below, at \[19(b)\]).

## Sentencing

### Charges taken into consideration

19     Apart from the proceeded charges, the defendant admitted to two other offences, which were taken into consideration (TIC) for the purpose of sentencing. The main details of the TIC charges were as follows:

> (a)     on 6 February 2020, having in possession intimate images and recordings of the Victim without her consent, which was likely to cause humiliation to the Victim, an offence under s 377BD(1)(b) and punishable under s 377BD(2) of the Penal Code. (MAC-901663-2021)

> (b)     On 12 February 2020, intentionally distributing an intimate image of the Victim without her consent, having reason to believe that the distribution was likely to cause her humiliation, by posting on Facebook the intimate image of the Victim with her face blurred, her breasts visible, and engaging in sexual intercourse with the Supervisor, an offence under s 377BE(1) punishable under s 377BE(3) of the Penal Code. (DAC-904517-2021) (This offence related to the re-posting of the intimate image on Facebook after the initial post had been taken down.)

### Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

20     For the s 380 Charge, the prosecution made no submission on the sentence and left the matter to the court. For the s 377BE(1) Charge, the prosecution sought a sentence of at least 18 months’ imprisonment. This was submitted in the **_Prosecution’s Address on Sentence_** dated 28 September 2021 and the **_Prosecution’s Further Submissions on Sentence_** dated 21 October 2021. I subsequently brought to the attention of parties several concluded cases where imprisonment terms of between 5 weeks and 27 weeks had been imposed for offences under s 377BE(1), and invited further submissions in light of these cases. The **_Prosecution’s Sentencing Submissions (Unreported Precedents)_** dated 30 November 2021 were tendered, and the prosecution’s sentencing position of at least 18 months’ imprisonment remained unchanged.

21     The prosecution submitted that the dominant sentencing consideration was general deterrence. The distribution of intimate images and recordings was prevalent, and the enactment of s 377BE of the Penal Code provided a targeted response to deter the rising trend of such offences by providing adequate punishments. Reference was made to the recommendations of the Penal Code Review Committee in its Report dated August 2018 at pp 81-85 (considered below, at \[30\]-\[31\]).

22     It was submitted that a harsh deterrent sentence was warranted in the present case. The defendant obtained the Intimate Image by illegal means by stealing the Victim’s mobile phone. She never consented for him to view or possess the image, much less to distribute it to the public. In posting the image on Facebook, and setting the post as “public”, the defendant was motivated by malice, intending to cause maximum humiliation to the Victim (and to the Supervisor) by distributing to as many people as possible. A high degree of humiliation and distress was caused to the Victim due to the extensive reach of the Facebook post. The post garnered about 1,000 comments, 2,000 shares and 3,000 likes. The Victim was easily recognisable in the Intimate Image as her face was fully visible. There was a high level of intrusion into the Victim’s privacy as she was fully naked. While the defendant took down the post after it went viral, he re-posted the same image shortly after (with the Victim’s face blurred). Even though he subsequently took down the post, it was impossible to completely erase the image from the Internet once it had been disseminated, and the image might continue to be distributed online.

23     It was further submitted that the harm caused was not limited to the Victim, as the defendant also set out to humiliate the Supervisor. The defendant was unremorseful and had sought to justify his actions in his mitigation plea.

### Mitigation plea and defence’s submissions on sentence

24     Counsel for the defendant initially suggested, in a **_Skeletal Mitigation Plea_**, that the appropriate (global) sentence would be a term of imprisonment not exceeding one week. Subsequently, following the _Prosecution’s Address on Sentence_, the **_Defence Further Submissions_** dated 29 September 2021 were tendered. Finally, in response to the invitation by the court to make further submissions in light of the concluded cases under s 377BE(1), the **_Defence Further Submissions (No 2)_** dated 30 November 2021 were tendered. In these latest submissions, the defence suggested a higher global sentence in the region of 5 to 7 weeks’ imprisonment.

25     The personal and family background of the defendant was set out in the _Skeletal Mitigation Plea_. The defendant was 27 years old and divorced. His father, 58 years of age, worked as a part-time driver and was suffering from glaucoma. His mother was 54 years old and a housewife. The defendant attained an education up to NITEC in chemical process technology. He served National Service as a fire-fighter from 2013 to 2015. He obtained a Service Excellence Award for his outstanding contribution and commitment to the SCDF and a Perfect Attendance Award for not taking any medical leave during his National Service. He also saved a life by administering cardiac pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on a member of the public while off-duty. He had been working as an operation technician and was earning about $2,800 a month. Having been charged with the offences, however, he had been on no-pay leave, and his income stream had been cut off.

26     The circumstances which led to the offences was explained. The defendant and the Victim had a rocky relationship from the outset. He first married her on 6 August 2018. She previously led a lifestyle that would be deemed _haram_ (forbidden by Islamic law). She promised to change her ways upon marriage, but nothing changed. After three months, the defendant divorced her at the Syariah Court. Some time later, she contacted him and asked for another chance to settle down with him. He decided to give her the benefit of the doubt and eventually remarried her on 1 July 2019. Then she started to work with the Supervisor. Soon after, she started coming home late, occasionally at 12.00 to 1.00 am. The defendant initially tolerated her actions, but it became more frequent. He confronted her, and she assured him that she had been staying late only because of work-related matters, and he gave her the benefit of the doubt. However, she started to come home even later, at 3.00 to 4.00 am. The defendant started to feel insecure, and she again assured him that the late nights were for work-related matters. In October 2019, she started to come home occasionally at 6.00 am, and she even asked if she could stay over at the Supervisor’s home. Sometime in November 2019, the defendant was preparing to leave for work at 6.00 am when he chanced upon the Victim returning home. She left her phone unattended, and he decided to check her phone to allay his fears of her infidelity. Unfortunately, his suspicions were confirmed as her phone revealed intimate and sexual dialogue with the Supervisor with nude pictures and videos. The defendant confronted the Victim later that day. She admitted to having an affair but denied having sexual relations with her Supervisor. The defendant was overwhelmed with desperation and wanted to secure evidence to prove her infidelity. Thus he took her mobile phone to extract the relevant pictures and screenshots, and uploaded some of these on Facebook. He did so to warn others of the Supervisor’s womanising ways. He did not set out with the primary intention to target and humiliate the Victim. Once he realised the collateral damage he caused, including humiliation to the Victim, he immediately took down the post.

27     The defence submitted that the defendant’s culpability was significantly diminished. His actions were done in a fit of desperation to secure evidence on the Victim’s infidelity, after he had been repeatedly deceived by his wife. What he had posted on Facebook was nothing but the truth, exposing the immoral affair between the Victim and the Supervisor. This was not a situation of an offender threatening to blackmail a victim or a jealous lover seeking vengeance. It was a matter between a husband and wife where the wife had repeatedly cheated on the husband through sexual intercourse with another man. The Victim had abused the defendant’s trust, and he suffered greatly both mentally and emotionally. He developed Major Depressive Disorder, which affected his work, his relationship with his family, and his engagement in hobbies and other activities.

28     It was highlighted, in mitigation, that the defendant had no criminal antecedents, and this was his very first brush with the law. He had been a law-abiding citizen with good character. A testimonial from his employer showed him to be an honest, hardworking and capable individual. He had pleaded guilty early and was thoroughly remorseful for his wrongdoing. What he had done was completely out of character. It was done when he had been deeply anxious, desperate and stressed. It was a one-off aberration which he undertook never to repeat.

### Sentence for theft of mobile phone

29     For the s 380 Charge, the offence carried a mandatory punishment of imprisonment for a term of up to 7 years, and the offender was also liable to a fine. Both the prosecution and defence made no specific submission on what the term of imprisonment ought to be. In my judgment, a short custodial term was appropriate. I considered that the defendant committed the theft of the mobile phone not for its value as a physical object. He did so only to access the phone to look for pictures and messages to confirm his suspicions of the Victim’s adultery. He dispossessed her of the phone for only a short period of time, and returned the phone to her 15 to 30 minutes after taking it. During that period, however, he made copies of private contents on the phone without her knowledge and consent, the value of which was not readily quantifiable. All in, I considered a sentence of one week’s imprisonment to be appropriate for this offence.

### Sentence for distribution of intimate image

#### Dominant sentencing consideration

30     Section 377BE was a relatively new provision. It came into force on 1 January 2020 with the passing of the Criminal Law Reform Act 2019 (Act 15 of 2019). The provision was included in the Penal Code following the recommendations of the Penal Code Review Committee (“**PCRC**”) in 2018. The PCRC explained in its report[^1] that the Penal Code did not have a specific offence that criminalised the distribution of nude, semi-nude, or other sexual images without consent. The proliferation of the Internet and smart phones had made it extremely easy for images to be created, uploaded, and downloaded on various platforms, and very difficult for such images to be removed completely, causing the victim harm and distress. Various provisions in the Penal Code were commonly used to address such conduct: s 292(a) (sale of obscene books etc), s 383 (extortion), s 503 (criminal intimidation). Reliance on such a patchwork of existing provisions could lead to an inconsistent legal response to cases where the offending conduct was similar. A stronger and consistent response was required to address the actual or threatened distribution of nude, semi-nude, sexual or sexually explicit images without consent. Accordingly, the PCRC recommended creating a new offence of “distributing or threatening to distribute an intimate image”, which is now provided for in s 377BE of the Penal Code.

31     The offence of _distributing_ an intimate image or recording (s 377BE(1)) or _threatening to distribute_ an intimate image or recording (s 377BE(2)) is punishable under s 377BE(3) with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 5 years, or with fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishments. The PCRC explained[^2] that the spectrum of punishment prescribed should be able to accommodate egregious cases (for example, where the image was actually distributed and where serious harm was caused to the victim). At the same time, the punishments prescribed should not be automatically harsh as a starting point in all cases because there could be less egregious cases (for example, where an image was threatened to be distributed and the harm caused to the victim was not as serious).

32     Given the context in which s 377BE was enacted, in particular the ease with which intimate images and recordings could be distributed on various platforms on the Internet, and the serious harm and distress that could be caused to victims of such offences, general deterrence must feature as a dominant sentencing consideration for such offences. In addition, a retributive element in sentencing could be relevant where serious harm was caused to the victim.

#### Sentencing factors

33     The prosecution submitted a list of factors relevant to sentencing.[^3]

34     I accepted that the factors listed above were relevant to sentencing. To that list I would add more specific sentencing factors, which include the following:

> (a)     The _nature of the acts depicted_ in the intimate image or recording. For example, an image or recording depicting the victim engaging in penetrative sexual intercourse, masturbation, fellatio or any other sexual act, with the genitalia exposed, would likely cause more harm to the victim than a depiction of the victim’s nude body without any exposure of the private parts.

> (b)     The _identifiability of the victim_. For example, an image or recording showing the victim’s face clearly or partially, or showing any unique identifying features of the victim, would likely cause more harm to the victim than one in which the victim’s facial or other identifying features were obscured or not shown.

> (c)     The _quality of the image or recording_. For example, a clear and high-resolution video recording of the victim engaged in a sexual act, with sound, would likely cause more harm to the victim than a blurry recording or a still image.

> (d)     The _manner and extent of distribution_ of the image or recording. For example, distributing an image or recording on a platform accessible by the public at large would generally be more culpable and would likely cause more harm to the victim than distributing via a private message to another person. Also, the culpability of an offender and the harm caused to the victim would generally increase where the act of distribution was repeated multiple times, and where multiple images or recordings were distributed.

35     All these various sentencing factors had to be weighed and balanced to arrive at a properly calibrated sentence on the facts of each case.

#### Sentencing precedents

36     The prosecution, in submitting for a sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment, cited the case of _PP v Shahrul Nizam Bin Kharuddin_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 67</span> (“**_Shahrul Nizam_**”). This was a case that did not involve an actual distribution of an intimate image or recording, but a threat to do so, which was an offence under s 377BE(2) Penal Code. The offender and the victim had a romantic relationship. They subsequently ended their relationship, and the offender suspected the victim to be cheating on him. He demanded to know the identity of the man she was with. Although she denied the allegation, he sent WhatsApp messages to her threatening to send video recordings of her masturbating herself and fellating him to her family members and friends. He was motivated by malice, and threatened to send the recordings to the victim’s ex-husband, insinuating that the distribution of the recordings might cause her to lose the care of her daughter to her ex-husband. The offender pleaded guilty to a single charge under s 377BE(2) for threatening to distribute the intimate recordings. The prosecution sought a sentence of at least 14 weeks’ imprisonment. A sentence of 10 weeks’ imprisonment was imposed by the District Court. The offender’s appeal against the sentence was dismissed by the High Court.

37     The prosecution submitted that the sentence in the present case ought to be much higher than in _Shahrul Nizam_ as it involved the actual distribution of an intimate image of the Victim and was more egregious. I accepted that more harm was caused in the present case than in _Shahrul Nizam_ given that the Intimate Image was distributed to a large number of users on Facebook. I was not persuaded, however, that the present case was so much more egregious that it warranted a sentence that was _more than sevenfold_ the sentence in _Shahrul Nizam_.[^4]

38     In any event, I did not find _Shahrul Nizam_ to be particularly helpful in calibrating an appropriate sentence in the present case, given that it involved a charge under s 377BE(2) and not s 377BE(1). Hence I conducted a search by offence code on the Integrated Case Management System (ICMS) to find cases where offenders had been sentenced under s 377BE(1). I found four cases, which I brought to the attention of parties at a mention on 10 November 2021, and invited further submissions in light of these cases. Following the mention, and before sentence was passed on 3 December 2021, a fifth case was concluded, which the prosecution helpfully brought to the attention of the court. (The statement of facts tendered for each of these five cases, as well as the prosecution’s address on sentence and defence mitigation pleas (where available), are collated in the Prosecution’s Bundle of Authorities (“**PBOA**”).) A summary of these cases is set out below (at \[39\]-\[43\]), arranged in chronological order according to the dates on which the offenders were sentenced. As a precaution to ensure that the identities of the victims remained protected, the case names have been redacted.

39     In _PP v AA_ (SC-903409-2020)[^5] (“**_AA_**”), the offender, aged 24 years, pleaded guilty to a charge under s 377BE(1) (MAC-906992-2020). He used an image of his girlfriend’s breasts (which did not capture her face) as the cover photo for his fake Twitter account, and publicly posted the same picture on the Twitter account, knowing that such distribution would cause her distress. The Twitter account was used by the offender to offer purported sexting services online. The image had been sent by the victim to the offender while they were in a relationship, and she did not consent to him distributing the image online or sharing it with any other person. The offender had dissimilar antecedents. The prosecution sought a sentence of at least 6 weeks’ imprisonment; the offender was unrepresented. On 23 March 2021, the court sentenced the offender to 5 week’s imprisonment for this offence. (Apart from the charge under s 377BE(1), the offender also pleaded guilty to four other charges which were dissimilar; and there were five TIC offences, of which one was under s 377BE(1) involving the same victim.)

40     In _PP v BB_ (SC-903003-2021)[^6] (“**_BB_**”), the offender, aged 32 years, pleaded guilty to a charge under s 377BE(1) which was amalgamated pursuant to s 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (MAC-903752-2021). He distributed intimate images of his ex-girlfriend on 11 separate occasions within the span of a month. He sent four to five intimate images of her via online messaging applications to ten other online messaging accounts without her consent, having reason to believe that the distribution was likely to cause distress to her. He did so to spite her after they broke up. Most of the recipients of the images were her friends or followers on Instagram. The images had been taken while she was asleep and without her consent. They showed her exposed breasts, the profile of her left face, her exposed vagina, and a distinct wrist tattoo by which she was identifiable. The offender had dissimilar antecedents. The prosecution sought a sentence of 6 to 7 months’ imprisonment; the offender was unrepresented. On 27 July 2021, the court sentenced the offender to 6 months’ imprisonment on this amalgamated charge. (The offender also pleaded guilty to a charge under s 377BE(2) for threatening to distribute the images, and was given a concurrent sentence of 4 months’ imprisonment.)

41     In _PP v CC_ (SC-905945-2021)[^7] (“**_CC_**”), the offender, aged 32 years, pleaded guilty to a charge under s 377BE(1) (DAC-918964-2021). He uploaded videos of his ex-girlfriend having sex with him onto Facebook, knowing that the distribution would cause her alarm. He created a fake Facebook account for this purpose, and added people from the victim’s Facebook “friend list” to this fake Facebook account. The setting of the fake account was “public”, which meant that the videos uploaded onto the account could be viewed by the public. The videos showed the victim fully naked and having sex with the offender, with her face and breasts shown clearly, while the offender’s face was not captured in the video. (The videos had been recorded by the offender with the knowledge of the victim, and although she told him to delete them, and he promised that he would, he retained them for his viewing pleasure.) After uploading the videos, the offender took some screenshots of the videos on Facebook. He then deleted the videos from Facebook after taking the screenshots. He subsequently sent the victim screenshots of the sex videos on the fake Facebook account, and messaged her threatening that he would upload one sex video of her per day if she refused to meet him, knowing that the threat would cause her alarm. He pleaded guilty to a charge under s 377BE(2) in respect of this threat. There were two TIC offences, one under s 377BE(1) and one under s 377BE(2). The offender had no antecedents. For the s 377BE(1) charge, the prosecution sought a sentence of at least 24 to 30 weeks’ imprisonment; the offender was unrepresented. On 22 September 2021, the court sentenced the offender to 27 weeks’ imprisonment for this offence. The court also sentenced the offender to 18 weeks’ imprisonment for the s 377BE(2) charge, which was ordered to run concurrently.

42     In _PP v DD_ (SC-904550-2021)[^8] (“**_DD_**”), the offender, aged 28 years, pleaded guilty to a charge under s 377BE(1) (DAC-912255-2021). He sent a photograph of his girlfriend’s naked body (showing her bare breasts and genital region) to her cousin through Facebook messenger, knowing that the distribution was likely to cause humiliation to his girlfriend. (The photograph had been sent by her to him in the course of their relationship.) He was upset with her because she had taken loans from him and not repaid, and he was also angry that she was ignoring him. (There was a TIC charge under s 377BE(2) in which he threatened to distribute an intimate image or recording of the victim.) The offender had no antecedents. The prosecution sought a sentence of 4 months’ imprisonment; counsel for the offender suggested a sentence of not more than 12 weeks’ imprisonment. On 19 October 2021, the court sentenced the offender to 14 weeks’ imprisonment.

43     In _PP v EE_ (SC-905942-2021)[^9] (“**_EE_**”), the offender, aged 26 years, pleaded guilty to a charge under s 377BE(1) (DAC-915547-2021). He uploaded a video recording of his ex-girlfriend engaging in sexual intercourse with him on a pornographic website, having reason to believe that the distribution would likely cause her distress. The victim was fully naked in the video, and her face was visible in some parts of the video. The video was viewed more than 3000 times. The video had been recorded by the offender with the victim’s consent, and she had asked him to delete it after their relationship ended. The offender had no antecedents. The prosecution sought a sentence of 12 to 16 weeks’ imprisonment; counsel for the offender suggested a sentence of 8 weeks’ imprisonment. On 18 November 2021, the court sentenced the offender to 10 weeks’ imprisonment. (Apart from the s 377BE(1) charge, the offender also pleaded guilty to another charge which was dissimilar; and there was a TIC offence that was dissimilar.)

44     I found these precedents helpful in deriving a broad sensing of what an appropriate sentencing range in the present case might be. Similar to the present case, the offenders in the concluded cases all pleaded guilty and were either untraced or traced with unrelated antecedents. Although the cases were unreported, I found the facts of these cases, the sentencing submissions made by the prosecution and by defence counsel on those facts, and the sentences meted out by the court, to be helpful for comparative purposes.

45     The prosecution urged the court to give little weight to these cases as they were unreported.[^10] I accepted that unreported cases had little or no precedential value. That said, in the absence of any reported decisions on s 377BE(1) or any authoritative sentencing guidelines laid down by the High Court, it was expedient, in arriving at a fair sentence, to distil whatever guidance was possible from past cases rather than to proceed _a priori_. A consideration of past cases (though unreported) would enable the court to appreciate the diversity of the circumstances in which such offences can occur, and discern sentencing factors that may be relevant in order to arrive at a coherent sentence. The process of comparing and distinguishing such cases would help the court arrive at a just sentence in the case at hand which would not be disproportionate with past cases. (I note that in some of the concluded cases, the prosecution had made reference to past unreported cases for comparative purposes in the course of their sentencing submissions.[^11])

46     Considering the facts in the concluded cases, my assessment was that the present case was not so much more egregious than those cases such as to warrant the much higher sentence sought by the prosecution. In those cases, imprisonment sentences ranging from 5 weeks (_AA_) to 27 weeks (_CC_) had been imposed by the court. In the prosecution’s sentencing submissions, the highest sentences sought by the prosecution were imprisonment terms of 6 to 7 months (_BB_) or 24 to 30 weeks (_CC_). The present case was not as egregious as _BB_ or _CC_ (as will be explained below). Hence, the sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment sought by the prosecution in the present case seemed manifestly excessive.

#### Appropriate sentence

47     In deciding on the appropriate sentence, I considered the relevant sentencing factors (at \[33\]-\[34\], above) and compared the present case with the precedent cases (at \[36\], \[39\]-\[43\], above).

48     There were some aspects of the present case that increased the culpability of the defendant and the potential harm to the Victim.

> (a)     The Intimate Image of the Victim was highly intrusive. She was shown fully naked, her breasts visible, and engaging in sexual intercourse.

> (b)     The Victim’s face was fully visible in the Intimate Image and she was easily identifiable. The defendant also identified her as his wife on the Facebook post.

> (c)     The Intimate Image was distributed to a large number of people as the post was set as “public” on the defendant’s Facebook account. The post was seen by the Victim’s friends, who alerted her to it. The fact that the Victim could be identified and was in fact identified would have added to her humiliation.

> (d)     After the initial post went viral, the defendant took it down, but re-posted the image with the face of the Victim blurred (which was the subject of a TIC charge). This second post was only taken down a day later.

49     The prosecution submitted, as an aggravating factor, that the harm caused was not limited to the Victim, but the defendant also set out to humiliate the Supervisor. The Supervisor’s face was fully visible in the Intimate Image, and the defendant further shamed him by including his name and occupation in the post, calling him a “homewrecker” and warning others to be aware of him. It was submitted that the defendant not only committed an offence under s 377BE(1) against the Victim, but also against the Supervisor.[^12] I was unable to accept this submission. There was no charge under s 377BE(1) against the defendant in relation to the Supervisor. The Statement of Facts made no mention of the humiliation allegedly suffered by the Supervisor following the distribution of the Intimate Image, and no evidence was placed before the court of the harm caused to him. Even if the Supervisor was offended by the derogatory remarks or insinuations made by the defendant against him, for which he lodged a police report[^13], that did not constitute an offence under s 377BE(1), as the legally protected interest in s 377BE relates to the distribution of _intimate images or recordings_.

50     I was also unable to accept the prosecution’s submission that the defendant had acted out of malice and intended to cause maximum humiliation to the Victim.[^14] This assertion was not borne out by the evidence. Had it been the defendant’s intention to humiliate the Victim as much as possible, he could have uploaded the four-second or 16-second video recordings in his possession (described at \[13(a)\]-\[13(b)\], above), which showed her fully naked with her bare breasts and vagina visible and her face partially visible. Furthermore, the defendant “did not expect it to receive so much attention”[^15], and quickly removed the post when he realised that it had gone viral. He subsequently re-posted the image with the face of the Victim _blurred_ (while leaving the Supervisor’s face fully visible). Taken as a whole, the defendant’s actions did not show him to be a malicious person bent on causing maximum humiliation to the Victim.

51     In the defendant’s favour, I accepted that he was a person of good character. He had no antecedents. His offences were committed under very acute circumstances when he was in despair at the infidelity of his wife. They were a one-off aberration and did not call for specific deterrence. His early plea of guilt spared the Victim the need to come to court to testify. Further, the following considerations were relevant in assessing the defendant’s culpability and the harm caused by his offence:

> (a)     His motivation in posting the image was not to spite the Victim or to extort any concession from her. He did not bear such malice towards her as to seek to cause her maximum humiliation. I accepted the submission of the defence that his purpose in making the Facebook post with the Intimate Image was to expose what the Supervisor had done, so that others would not share the same fate as him.[^16]

> (b)     What was distributed was an image and not a video recording (unlike in _CC_ where videos of the victim having sex with the offender was posted on Facebook; or _EE_, where a video recording of the victim engaging in sexual intercourse with the offender was uploaded on a pornographic website).

> (c)     The offence did not involve a breach of trust by the defendant. In this context, a breach of trust would typically occur where the victim had consented to the offender taking the intimate image or recording while they were in an intimate relationship and had trusted that these recordings would be kept between them and for their own consumption only (see, for example, _Shahrul Nizam_ at \[39\]), and the offender breached that trust by distributing (or threatening to distribute) the image or recording. All the precedent cases involved a breach of trust. In some cases, the image or recording was sent by the victim (as in _AA_ and _DD_), or taken by the offender with the consent of the victim (as in _CC_ and _EE_). In more egregious cases, the image or recording was taken without the victim’s knowledge or consent (as in _BB_). The present case did not involve such a breach of trust by the defendant.

52     The precedent cases showed that for offences under s 377BE(1), the starting point in sentencing would generally be a term of imprisonment. This would accord with the sentencing consideration of general deterrence. The following are some broad observations about the sentences that had been imposed.

> (a)      _AA_ was illustrative of a case where harm-culpability was at the lower end of the sentencing range. Where an image of a woman’s breasts (without showing her face) was disseminated on a social media platform like Twitter, a sentence in the range of 5 weeks’ imprisonment could be the starting point. The present case, which involved an image showing the Victim engaged in sexual intercourse with her face and breasts clearly visible, and shared on a Facebook post which went viral, would clearly warrant a higher sentence.

> (b)     Much higher in terms of harm-culpability was the case of _BB_, where the offender distributed, on 11 occasions over a month, four to five highly intrusive images of his ex-girlfriend, surreptitiously taken while she was asleep, showing her breasts, vagina and face, mostly to recipients who knew her. The sentence was 6 months’ imprisonment. By comparison, the present case did not involve such an egregious breach of trust. The culpability of the present defendant, who posted a single image of the Victim on Facebook, would be much lower.

> (c)      _CC_ was also higher in terms of harm-culpability as the offender uploaded _videos_ of his ex-girlfriend fully naked and having sex with him, with her face and breasts clearly shown, on Facebook with a public setting; and took screenshots of the post and then threatened her with the screenshots. The sentence was 27 weeks’ imprisonment. By comparison, the present case, which involved the posting of a single _image_ of the Victim, without any threat, was lower in harm-culpability.

> (d)     In _Shahrul Nizam_ (a case under s 377BE(2)), the offender threatened the victim that he would send video recordings of her masturbating herself and fellating him to her family members and friends. The sentence was 10 weeks’ imprisonment. In the present case, considering the actual distribution of the Intimate Image to a large number of recipients, the potential harm to the Victim would be much higher than in _Shahrul Nizam_ and would call for a higher sentence. That said, certain aggravating factors in _Shahrul Nizam_, such as malice and a breach of trust, were absent in the present case.

> (e)     The cases of _DD_ and _EE_ were not easy to reconcile. In _DD_, the offender sent a single _photograph_ of his girlfriend’s _naked body_ (showing her bare breasts and genital region) to her cousin; the prosecution sought a sentence of 4 months’ imprisonment. In _EE_, the offender uploaded a _video recording_ of his ex-girlfriend _engaging in sexual intercourse_ with him, where she was fully naked and her _face was visible_ in some parts of the video, on a pornographic website, and the video was _viewed more than 3000 times_. The harm-culpability in _EE_ seemed higher than in _DD_, yet a lower sentence of 12 to 16 weeks’ imprisonment was sought by the prosecution.

53     In the present case, the context of the defendant’s offence could be summarised as follows. He was devastated by the infidelity of his wife. She had been cheating on him and committing adultery by sexual intercourse with her Supervisor. He sought to expose what the Supervisor had done by uploading the Intimate Image on Facebook, which showed the Supervisor’s face, as well as the Victim’s face and breasts, as they engaged in sexual intercourse. In doing so, the defendant had “reason to believe” that the distribution of the Intimate Image was “likely to cause her humiliation” (as stated in the s 377BE(1) Charge). But it was not his intention to cause her maximum humiliation. He did not upload sexually explicit video recordings of her that were in his possession. There was no breach of trust on his part in his act of uploading the Intimate Image. Seen in this context, therefore, the defendant’s culpability was not high. That said, the defendant’s Facebook post quickly went viral and, after a few hours, the post had been viewed by thousands of Facebook users. While this was something that the defendant had not expected, he had to bear the consequences of his actions. The fact that the post was viewed by a large number of Facebook users meant that greater harm was potentially caused to the Victim.

54     All in, weighing the offence-specific factors of harm and culpability, as well as the offender-specific aggravating and mitigating factors, and comparing the sentences imposed in past cases, it was my judgement that an appropriate sentence for the present offence would be 12 weeks’ imprisonment. (This was higher than the 10 weeks’ imprisonment in _Shahrul Nizam_; and higher than the 10 weeks’ imprisonment in _EE_, where the sexually explicit video of the victim engaged in sexual intercourse was uploaded on a pornographic website and viewed more than 3,000 times.)

### Sentence imposed

55     Given that the offences in the s 380 Charge and the s 377BE(1) Charge were distinct in nature and committed on separate occasions, both sentences were ordered to run consecutively.

56     In summary, the sentences imposed were as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="31.36%"> <col width="26.78%"> <col width="41.86%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Offence</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentence</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-904515-2021</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">s 380 Penal Code</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">One week’s imprisonment.

57     The sentence has been stayed pending the appeal by the prosecution. The defendant is on bail pending the appeal.
