> **Statement of Facts**

> The Accused is Cai Linghui, male, 43 years old, a Chinese national bearing FIN XXX. He came to Singapore to work in November 2021. At the time of the offence, he was employed as a construction worker at Adwin Enterprises Pte Ltd.

> The victim is Ma Longfei, male, 33 years old, a Chinese national employed by H P Construction & Engineering Pte Ltd.

> At the time of the offence, the Accused and the victim were working at the same construction site located at Choa Chu Kang Ave 1 (Trinity Christian Centre).

> _First Information Report_

> On 4 June 2022, Shaik Abdullah s/o Samsudeen, working as a safety manager under H P Construction & Engineering Pte Ltd, made a police report informing that the Accused had assaulted the victim at the construction site. The victim had been conveyed to the hospital.

> _Facts relating to charge_

> On 3 June 2022 at around 1pm, the Accused and victim were working at the construction site. The victim came across the Accused’s safety harness, left unattended. He decided to use it. While he was working and wearing the harness, the Accused approached him and said that the harness belonged to the Accused, and that the Accused wanted it back. The victim asked him to wait. They got into a verbal dispute. The Accused was angry at the victim and pulled the harness downwards. This caused the victim to lose his footing and fall from the scaffolding he was standing on. As he was falling, he accidentally and lightly kicked the Accused on his chest. The victim then landed on the ground, still tethered to the scaffolding by his harness.

> The Accused then punched the victim and the victim retaliated by punching him back. The Accused took a steel pipe and hit the victim’s head with it, causing the victim’s helmet to fall off. The victim kicked the Accused once on his leg as they wrestled with the steel pipe. The Accused then punched the victim repeatedly in his face until he was stopped by other workers at the construction site. The Accused’s repeated punches were captured on camera.

> The victim was conveyed to a clinic and subsequently to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital for his injuries. He was seen at the Emergency Medicine Department at around 8pm and was assessed to have the following injuries (Medical reports dated 17 and 23 June, and 8 July 2022):

>> i.    abrasion over the frontal region, right periorbital swelling, tenderness and crepitus,

>> ii.    scratches and abrasions over the left chest wall,

>> iii.   abrasions over the right shin, and

>> iv.    multiple right-sided facial fractures, including that of the right lamina papyracea (right medial orbital wall), bilateral nasal bones and frontal process of maxilla.

> The victim was offered surgical fixation or conservative management and opted for conservative management. He also complained of some blurriness of vision. He was discharged the next day with analgesia, antibiotics, follow-ups with the ophthalmology and plastic surgery specialists and medical leave from 3 to 9 June 2022. He was reviewed again on 6 July 2022 and noted to have no significant cosmetic or functional defects other than a non-specific nasal obstruction.

> The Accused sustained some pain in his chest area.

> By punching the victim repeatedly in the face, knowing it likely that the victim would sustain grievous hurt, the Accused has committed an offence under s 325 of the Penal Code.

> The Accused admits to the offence and stands charged.

## Antecedents

4       The Accused is untraced.

## Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

5       The Prosecution submitted for a sentence of 13 to 14 months’ imprisonment based on the cases of _PP v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 127</span> and _Saw Beng Chong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGHC 175</span>.

## Mitigation

6       The Accused said that he did not think the injuries were serious as the victim had returned to work subsequently.

## Sentence

#### Grievous Hurt - Sentencing approach

7       The sentencing approach for grievous hurt offences has been articulated by the Court of Appeal in _PP v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 127</span>, which laid down a two-stage sentencing framework to be considered (at \[55\]):

> _Indicative starting points based on the seriousness of the injury_

> 55    In the light of the above review of the precedents, we turn to the sentencing approach to be taken in cases prosecuted under s 325 of the Penal Code. The primary sentencing objective in such cases is likely to be deterrence. Further, retribution may also be relevant as a sentencing consideration where heinous violence has been inflicted. In our judgment, we think that sentencing in such cases should be approached in a two-step process as follows:

>> (a)    First, because the seriousness of the injury caused underscores the inherent mischief targeted by s 325, it is a good indicator of the gravity of the offence and can guide the court in determining the indicative starting point for sentencing.

>> (b)    Second, after the indicative starting point has been identified, the sentencing judge should consider the necessary adjustments upwards or downwards based on an assessment of the offender’s culpability and the presence of relevant aggravating and/or mitigating factors.

#### First stage - Indicative starting sentence

8       The victim in this case suffered multiple injuries to his face. Three medical reports from Ng Teng Fong General Hospital dated 17 June 2022, 23 June 2022 and 8 July 2022 were submitted in evidence to describe the injuries and the subsequent treatment of these injuries. He was also placed on seven days’ of medical leave.

9       The victim sustained multiple abrasions over left chest and right shin, right medial orbital wall fracture and bilateral nasal bones and frontal process of maxilla fractures. A CT scan revealed multiple right sided facial fractures, including that of right lamina papyracea and emphysema over the right periorbital area extending to the superior extraconal space and right buccal space. It was also noted that there was right periorbital swelling with crepitus. The victim was subsequently also seen at the Ophthalmology Department of the Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, where he was offered surgical repair of the lamina papyracea fracture.

10     These injuries which were concentrated on his face and eye region should be considered particularly serious as these are vulnerable parts of the body. The Court of Appeal had in _PP v BDB_ set an indicative starting point of around three years and six months for cases involving multiple fractures of the ribs \[at 56\]:

> 56.    …s 325 encompasses a broad spectrum of different forms of grievous hurt ranging from a fracture to death. We do not propose to set out a range of indicative starting points for each type of grievous hurt, but what is relevant for present purposes is that in a case where the grievous hurt takes the form of death (as in the case of the first charge against the Respondent), the indicative starting point should be a term of imprisonment of around eight years, which is close to the maximum imprisonment term of ten years; whereas in a case where the grievous hurt takes the form of multiple fractures of the type and gravity described in the sixth charge against the Respondent, the indicative starting point should be a term of imprisonment of around three years and six months. For the avoidance of doubt, we wish to make it clear that the indicative starting point might be higher or lower depending on the type and seriousness of the injuries caused. These indicative starting points may then be calibrated upwards or downwards in view of the relevant aggravating and/or mitigating factors.

11     As there can be a broad spectrum of injuries covered under grievous hurt it is necessary to look at the nature of the injuries caused and the degree of pain the victim was subjected to in this case. To this end the learned CJ has further refined the starting point of sentence for grievous hurt offences in the case of _Saw Beng Chong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGHC 175</span> \[at 40\]:

> 40.    In my judgment, where there are multiple fractures that are not of a more serious nature – as was the case in BDB – and that cause a victim to suffer some degree of disruption and persistent pain, a starting point of between 9 and 14 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate.

12     The lower court’s adoption of a starting point of 12 to 13 months in the case was endorsed by the learned CJ.

13     In _Saw Beng Chong v PP_, the victim suffered fractures over his nose, rib and orbital wall whereas the injuries in this case were far more serious as the injuries concentrated on the victim’s face and he was offered surgical fixation for the injuries and he also suffered blurriness of vision. In the circumstances I agreed with the submissions of the Prosecution that the indicative starting point sentence in this case ought to be 13 to 14 months imprisonment.

#### Second Stage - Necessary adjustments based on accused’s culpability, mitigation and aggravating factors

14     The High Court in _Saw Beng Chong v PP_ was of the view that given the aggravating factors in that case the sentence imposed by the lower court was in fact lenient. The learned CJ observed \[at 47\]:

> 47    Taking all these aggravating factors and the one mitigating factor, I would have adjusted the sentence upwards by up to three months at the second stage of the _BDB_ analysis. The resulting sentence would have been higher than that awarded by the District Judge. Hence, the sentence meted out by the District Judge was lenient, and clearly not manifestly excessive.

15     I considered the Accused’s conduct in this case to be that of a vicious aggressor who also admitted to using a metal pole to strike at the victim and endanger the safety of the victim by pulling him off the scaffolding. The footage captured by the CCTV admitted in evidence by the prosecution clearly demonstrated the violent assault by the Accused with relentless blows thrown at the victim.

16     Against this backdrop of overwhelming video evidence, his guilty plea had little mitigating value here, because the case against him was strong and he had little option but to accept liability. In such circumstances, a guilty plea will have limited weight: _PP v BDB_ at \[74\].

17     However, I also considered the fact that the entire incident was not pre-meditated and started because the victim had worn the safety harness used by the Accused who had gone to the washroom. On return, the Accused demanded the return of the safety harness, which led to an argument. It was in the process of the safety harness being returned to the Accused that he grabbed the leg strap of the safety harness and pulled it downwards causing the victim to lose his balance and fall. A violent fight ensued shortly after. The victim tried to defend himself against the onslaught of blows from the Accused.

18     As the assault was not premeditated, I accorded some mitigating weight to this fact when calibrating the sentence downwards from the indicative starting sentence of 13 to 14 months imprisonment. In the result I imposed a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment which was ordered to commence from the date of his remand.

19     The Accused has now appealed against the sentence imposed.
