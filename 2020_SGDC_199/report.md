Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9789/2020/01.\]

27 August 2020

### District Judge Shaiffudin Bin Saruwan:

## Introduction

1       The Accused is Chen Yue, a 61 years old PRC national.

2       He pleaded guilty to two charges –

> (a)     One count of riding an unregistered personal mobility device (“PMD”) on a footpath knowing that the PMD was not registered, which was an offence under s 28B(1) of the Active Mobility Act 2017 (No. 3 of 2017) (“AMA”)(DAC 908942/20).

> (b)     One count of doing a rash act, to wit, riding the PMD against the flow of traffic and causing a collision with the victim, which was an offence under s 338(a) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)(“PC”)(MAC 903801/20). The offence happened on 23 October 2019 at or about 4.00 pm, along Selegie Road, in front of Wilkie’s Edge.

3       One count of riding the PMD on a road under s 5A(1) punishable under s 5A(3)(a) of the Road Traffic Act, Cap 276, were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

## The Facts

4       The Accused had purchased the PMD sometime in September 2019. The PMD in this case was a e-scooter. Although he knew that he was required to register it, he did not do so because he had decided to sell it away a few days later.

5       On 23 October 2019, at about 4.00 pm, he rode the PMD from 39 Kinta Road towards the direction of Dhoby Ghaut MRT station to meet the potential buyer. He rode the PMD on the footpath along Selegie Road. When he reached the vicinity of Selegie Court at about 4.10 pm, he decided to ride his PMD on the road as there were many pedestrians on the footpath. In doing that, he rode against the flow of traffic. He rode on lane 5 of the 5-laned Selegie Road at the speed of about 15 kmph. He had an unobstructed view of the footpath in front of him.

6       At around the same time, the victim had walked out from Wilkie’s Edge. She stood on the footpath for about 12 seconds to wait for the traffic to clear before she crossed the road. As she stepped onto the road from the footpath, the Accused rode his PMD directly into her, causing her to fall down.

7       The Accused felt an impact on his right arm and he stopped on the right side of the road and looked back. He saw the victim lying face down on the road. She was bleeding from her mouth and face. He carried her onto the footpath. She was later conveyed to hospital in an ambulance. The Accused stayed at the scene until the Police arrived.

8       At the material time, the weather was fine. The road surface was dry and visibility was clear. Traffic flow was moderate.

9       The Accused sustained a laceration on his left knee from the impact. The injury was bandaged by paramedics. He refused further medical treatment.

10     In a medical report by Dr Lee Chee Hoe from the National Neuroscience Institute, the victim had suffered the following injuries –

> (a)     Frontal haematoma;

> (b)     Abrasion on philtrum;

> (c)     Lacerations on minor upper and lower lips;

> (d)     Shallow acute subdural haematoma along the left cerebral convexity; and,

> (e)     Fracture of the right frontal skull extending into the frontal sinus, the right orbital roof and the right ethmoidal roof.

11     She was treated conservatively. A repeat CT brain scan on 24 October 2019 showed that the acute subdural haemorrhage was stable in size. She underwent physiotherapy and occupational therapy in the ward. She was discharged well on 26 October 2019. She was given 31 days hospitalisation leave (23 October to 22 November 2019).

12     The victim continued to experience occasional giddiness. She sustained a scar above her lips as a result of the collision. Her teeth had also become loose and required check-ups once every six months. She intended to seek physiotherapy and acupuncture to aid her recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic was over.

13     The victim’s medical expenses were fully covered by insurance. On 4 May 2020, the Accused made a voluntary compensation payment of $8,000 to her.

## Antecedents

14     The Accused was a first offender.

## Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

15     DPP Grace Teo sought a sentence of at least six weeks’ imprisonment for the s 338(a) PC offence, and a fine for the s 28B(1) AMA offence. She left the quantum of the fine to the court’s discretion.

16     In relation to the s 338(a) PC offence, she set out the basis for her proposed sentence, namely –

> (a)     The key sentencing consideration was general deterrence: per _Cai Mei Ying v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 24</span> (“_Cai Mei Ying_”).

> (b)     The key determinants of sentence were harm and culpability. The sentencing framework in _Tang Ling Lee v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 813</span> (“_Tang Ling Lee_”) was helpful to guide the court to determine the appropriate sentence. And as the framework was set out in the context of the s 338(b) PC negligent act offence, an offence that involved a rash act should generally be visited with a heavier punishment because level of culpability was higher.

> (c)     The sentence sought by the prosecution was in line with the case precedent involving high culpability and greater harm: _PP v A Sujendran_ (MAC 904328/19, unreported)(“_Sujendran_”). In _Sujendran_, the offender pleaded guilty to one count under s 338(a) PC for riding a non-compliant e-scooter at an unsafe speed (28 kmph) at the ground floor of a HDB flat. There were people present. He had failed to keep a proper lookout when approaching the lift lobby area and collided into the victim. The victim suffered a right knee contusion with possible tibial spine avulsion fracture. He was given 47 days hospitalisation leave. His right leg had to be in a back slab for about two months. The offender had made full compensation of the medical expenses. He was traced for rioting, desertion and absence without leave convictions. He was sentenced to six weeks’ imprisonment.

17     DPP Teo sought a similar sentence as that in _Sujendran_ because the harm caused in the present case was similar, in that, the victim had suffered serious, potentially life-threatening head injury. She had continued to experience occasional giddiness and would require further treatment. Secondly, in riding against the flow of traffic when knowing that there were a lot of pedestrians on the footpath, the Accused had exhibited a high degree of rashness.

## Mitigation plea

18     The Accused tendered a written plea in mitigation. He had moved to Singapore in 2015 and before his arrest, had stayed at a rented place at 39 Kinta Road with his wife. He was a visit pass holder and had worked as a service crew at Haidilao for more than two years earning $1,400 a month. He was retrenched during the Circuit Breaker period. At the time of the offence, he was unemployed. His wife was a permanent resident and worked at the casino at Marina Bay Sands drawing a salary of $1,900 a month.

19     The Accused had bought the e-scooter to transport him to work. On the day of the offence, he was on his way to meet a potential buyer for the e-scooter.

20     The Accused asked for a fine to be imposed. He highlighted that he had made voluntary compensation of $8,000 notwithstanding that the victim’s medical expenses were covered by her insurance. He furnished a letter evidencing the private settlement that was reached between them. He pleaded remorse and promised not to re-offend in the future.

## The prescribed punishments

21     The prescribed punishment for the s 28B(1) AMA offence was a fine not exceeding $2,000 or imprisonment not exceeding three months or to both.

22     The prescribed punishment for the s 338(a) PC offence was imprisonment not exceeding four years, or a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to both.

## Sentence

### The s 338(a) PC offence

23     I agreed with the prosecution that the paramount sentencing consideration was general deterrence, given the recent rise in bicycle and PMD related accidents: _Cai Mei Ying_ (at \[4\] of judgment).

24     The key sentencing determinants were harm and culpability. In this case, greater harm was caused as the victim had suffered, _inter alia_, a fractured skull, which was potentially life-threatening. She still suffered from the effect of that injury ie, she continued to have occasional bouts of giddiness which would require follow-up treatment. Culpability was high in that the Accused had ridden the e-scooter against the flow of traffic. He also knew that there were many pedestrians on the footpath. Despite having a clear view of what was in front of him, he collided into the victim who had stepped onto the road from the footpath.

25     I applied the _Tang Ling Lee_ sentencing framework. I was mindful that the framework was in the context of a negligent act. Therefore, there should necessarily be an uplift in the sentences proposed in the framework as the act in the present case was a rash act. A rash act involved a higher mental level of culpability ie, the Accused was aware of the potential risks that might arose from his actions but he proceeded anyway.

26     It was my view that the present case fell into category 3 of the _Tang Ling Lee_ framework. The presumptive sentencing range under this category was more than two weeks’ imprisonment.

27     I agreed with DPP Teo that the levels of harm and culpability in the present case was closely similar to that in _Sujendran_. Therefore, using _Sujendran_ as a guide, I imposed a sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment.

### The s 28B(3)(a) AMA offence

28     I noted that the Accused had only ridden his e-scooter on the footpath for less than 10 minutes, and there was evidence that he was speeding at the time. I imposed a fine of $500 in default two days’ imprisonment.

## Conclusion

29     The total sentence was 6 weeks’ imprisonment and fine $500 in default two days’ imprisonment.

30     The Accused was dissatisfied with the sentences. He has lodged an appeal. He is currently serving his sentence of imprisonment.
