### District Judge Ng Peng Hong:

## Introduction

1       The Accused Francis Lee Sian Sian (“Francis”) is appealing against his sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment in respect of a s147 rioting charge.

2       Altogether there were 5 accused persons including Francis who were jointly tried for a similar offence. Each of them claimed trial to one count of rioting under s147 Penal Code.

3       For the purpose of this judgment, it will suffice to set out the charge against the accused person Francis. It reads:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="23.46%"> <col width="76.54%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge no</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Details</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 906035-2015</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">That you, on or about 27 November 2014, at or about 11.05 pm, at Block 51 Lorong 6 Toa Payoh #XXX, Singapore, together with one David Tan, one Justin Teo Kim Piew, one Yong Chee Meng and one Tang Wei Leong, were members of an unlawful assembly whose common object was to cause hurt to one Tam Moh Peng, and in the prosecution of the common object of the said unlawful assembly, one or more of you used violence against the said Tam Moh Peng, <em>to wit</em>, by fisting and kicking him, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 147 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

4       At the end of the trial, all the accused persons were found guilty and convicted of their respective charge. Francis was sentenced to 3 years’ imprisonment while the sentence for the other co-accused ranged from 18 months’ to 24 months’ imprisonment.

5       I now set out the reasons for the sentence meted out to Francis.

## Case for the Prosecution

6       The Prosecution called 6 witnesses. At the close of the case for the defence, the Prosecution exercised its right pursuant to s230(1)(t) Criminal Procedure Code to recall 2 of the prosecution witnesses, namely Rachael Tam Li Qi (PW2) and M Somasundaram (PW6). The other rebuttal witness was Dave Ng (PW7).

## Evidence of Thean Wei Mien (PW1)

7       PW1 is the wife of Tam Moh Perng (the “victim”). She was the key prosecution witness. Her testimony was that on the day of the incident, 3 accused persons, namely Justin, David and Tang came to her residence to look for the victim for the repayment of an alleged debt. But the victim was not at home at the material time. The victim was drinking at another location. When the wife called him on the phone in the presence of the 3 accused, the victim belted out vulgarities, threats and also asked the accused to wait for him. The phone was on speaker mode. It was clear to PW1 that the victim was drunk. Accordingly, the accused persons were told by PW1 to wait downstairs.

8       Subsequently, PW1 saw the victim coming home in a taxi. Soon thereafter, she heard shouting and banging of her house’s metal gate. Upon opening her door, she saw the victim and the 3 men identified as Justin, David and Tang, were outside the door. The victim’s arms were held by Justin and Tang. Justin held on the victim’s right while Tang used his arm to lock the victim’s neck to restrain the victim’s movement. (PW1 demonstrated it in court by placing her arm over her neck with the elbow below the base of the neck). PW1 also saw the victim’s head was bleeding and his eye was swollen. She saw David used his hand to hit at the victim’s head. During the commotion, PW1 called out to her daughter Rachael (PW2) to call for the police and shouted at David to stop hitting the victim.

9       PW1 testified that the victim was unable to do anything as he was held by the 2 accused. Indeed, the victim was dazed and had no response when hit on the head. PW1 then came out of her flat and stood between David and the victim. She tried to free the victim from Justin and Tang but failed. About this time PW1 saw 2 men coming from the lift lobby and walking hurriedly towards them. They were identified as Francis and Yong. Francis was ahead of Yong. At this time the victim was still held on by the other accused persons. There were some verbal exchanges between the victim and the accused and PW1 saw Francis punched the victim’s head. She also saw Yong hit at the victim’s head. PW1 was petrified and called out to PW2 to pull the victim into the house. In the process of pulling and pushing him into the house, Yong kicked the victim on his leg. PW1 quickly pushed the victim into house.

10     Part of the situation was recorded by PW2. See exhibit P5.

11     It was not disputed that the victim was conveyed to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (“TTSH”). The medical report issued by TTSH (exhibit P1) showed the victim sustained injuries over his head, the eye area, chest and abdomen.

## Evidence of Rachael Tam Li Qi (PW 2)

12     PW2 is the daughter of the victim. She was a small built lady. Her height was 1.5m. She was 22 years of age when she gave evidence in court. At the time of the incident she would be 18 years old.

13     PW2 was in her room when she heard crashing sound from the metal gate and her mother calling her to call for the police which she did. When she rushed out from her room, she saw her father was held by 2 men. One was holding the victim with the arm wrapped round the victim’s neck in a headlock. The victim was in a daze and motionless. PW2 noticed that her father had been assaulted. But she did not witness the assault on the victim. Both PW1 and PW2 tried to free the victim and pull him into the house. When this was happening, PW2 was on the phone with the police. Finally, they managed to get the victim into the house after the victim was released by the accused. When PW2 had entered the house, she noticed that there were 5 people outside her house.

14     PW2 confirmed that a video of the situation was recorded after her father (the victim) had been pulled into the house. By this time the assault had stopped. A review of P5 showed that at the time stamp 0000, Yong was holding on to the metal door. There was also vulgarity in Hokkien uttered.

## Evidence of Tam Moh Perng (PW3 also referred to as the “victim”)

15     The victim confessed that he could not remember much that night. But he knew he was drunk, agitated, angry, used vulgarities to scold and got into a fight. He could not recall how many people were involved in the fight. He was injured on his face and head. He conceded that it was possible that he might have started the fight.

## M Somasundram (PW6)

16     In 2014, PW6 was a police senior investigation officer. He confirmed that the employer of the 5 accused persons was a debt collection company. PW6 also found that the advocated tactics and strategy of the said company was the use of force to recover debts.

## Summary of Findings

17     I found that the testimonies of PW1 and PW2 contained the ring of truth. There was no evidence that PW1 and PW2 had any motive to lie in court. Having seen and heard them in court, I would unreservedly prefer their evidence over that of the defence. Their evidence was also supported by the medical report of the victim and consistent with exhibit P5. I also accepted the evidence given by the other prosecution witnesses.

18     All the 5 accused persons were working as debt collectors at the material time.

19     It was not disputed that the victim was drunk at the material time.

20     It was admitted by Justin that he and his colleagues were unhappy about being threatened by the victim. See Day 9 NE at page 23. They also felt threatened. See page 2 of exhibit P3.

21     Subsequently, Francis and Yong came to meet the other 3 accused at the ground level. They came not by chance but due to the call over the walkie-talkie. It was clearly a summons for reinforcement.

22     I was of the view that Francis and Yong had come to the assistance of the other 3 accused and also participated in the fight in the manner described by PW1. See above at \[8\] to \[9\]. I found that both Francis and Yong joined in the assault very soon after the other 3 accused had assaulted the victim. It was also clear that the assault took place in prosecution of the common object of the 5 accused persons.

23     I accepted PW1’s evidence that Francis together with the other 4 accused did take part in the assault against the victim.

24     I also found that when PW1 opened the door, Justin and Tang were restraining the victim outside his apartment. See Day 7 NE at page 13 and Day 9 NE at page 27. At that moment, the victim’s head was bleeding while his eye was swollen. PW1 also saw David hitting the victim’s head once.

25     David admitted that Tang was holding on to the victim’s head in a headlock while Justin held on to his arm. See Day 7 page 13 line 5. (See also Justin’s evidence at Day 9 NE page 27 where he described it as headlock by Tang and when he demonstrated it, it was as if Tang was using his arm around the victim’s shoulder and not the neck). During the assault, Francis and Yong came and joined in the attack. PW1 saw Francis punched the victim’s head. Their presence and demeanour were captured in the video recording of PW2. See exhibit P5. Although P5 did not capture the actual assault by Francis and Yong but it depicted the threatening look displayed by Francis.

## Guilty and Convicted

26     Having reviewed the evidence and considered the submissions of the parties, I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that all the accused persons were guilty of their respective charges. Accordingly, they were convicted.

## Antecedents

27     Francis has a long string of previous convictions for a number of varied offences from as early as 1991. He had been convicted for traffic related offences, property related offences, drug trafficking, and other drug related offences. His first violent offence was committed in 1994.

28     In the recent years, Francis had a series of violent offences and traffic related offences committed over the years in 2014, 2015 and 2016 but were collectively dealt with and sentenced by the court on 16 November 2017 except for the current offence. His present offence was committed on 27 November 2014. From the court record, it revealed that Francis was produced and charged in court as early as in August 2014. Despite having been charged in court and being investigated for various offences, he continued to re-offend and was remanded on 19 August 2016 for investigation. His bail was revoked on 1 September 2016. On 16 November 2017, Francis pleaded guilty to 19 offences except for the current rioting charge and he was jailed for a global sentence of 3 years 14 months and fined $10,000 in respect of 19 offences. He was also disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for life.

## Submission on Sentence

29     The Prosecution has tendered a written submission on sentence. The Prosecution submitted for a sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment. The submissions were based on the culpability of the Accused, his antecedents, the past sentencing precedents and the harm caused.

30     The Prosecution also contended that the assault was prolonged and that as professional debt collectors, the accused persons had used “brutally unprecedented tactics” in carrying out their duties.

## Mitigation

31     I considered the oral mitigation plea made by the Defence.

32     Counsel for Francis, Mr. Sudeep Kumar submitted that the Accused was carrying out his duty to collect money from the debtor. He was not the aggressor. He submitted for a sentence of 6-9 months’ imprisonment.

33     Counsel was instructed that Francis was last released from prison in 2012 after he had completed serving his imprisonment term for his drug related offences. Counsel submitted that this affray was thrusted upon the Accused. It was also submitted that the antecedents were dated and would have been referred to on 16 November 2017. It was contended that to refer to it again would amount to double jeopardy.

34     Counsel also submitted that the injuries suffered by the victim were minor. That the assault was of short duration and happened at the spur of the moment.

35     The Defence submitted that there was provocation on the part of the victim. It was conceded by the victim that there was a possibility that he might have started the fight. In fact, he could not remember much about what had taken place that day. However, in my view, the victim was clearly in a drunken state. He was also outnumbered by the accused persons. In such a situation, any alleged provocation can only be a low-level provocation and the assault that took place was clearly out of proportion. I would therefore give low weight to this factor.

## Main Sentencing Consideration for Rioting Offence

36     I agreed with the Prosecution that for the rioting offence which is a group offence, the primary sentencing consideration should be one of general and specific deterrence, particularly in the light of the thuggish practices adopted by the Accused as debt collector. In fact, as highlighted by the Prosecution “the tactics employed by such debt collectors are essentially identical to those which are employed by “runners” who harass borrowers and other persons on behalf of Unlicensed Moneylenders”. But I was also fully aware that the sentencing regime prescribed under the Moneylenders Act was different from that under s147 Penal Code. Bearing this in mind, in the present case, not only was the victim intimated and assaulted by the accused persons but his family members were also affected. In fact, the victim’s wife (PW1) testified that she was scared, nervous and petrified by the event.

## Sentencing Factors

37     Bearing in mind the main sentencing consideration, I also took into account the factors stated below in assessing the sentence to be imposed. First was the violence used by the Accused as professional debt collector in discharging his duty to collect the debts. Such tactics of harassment and assault cannot be encouraged. The Accused should have resorted to reasonable and legal steps to recover the debts. Clearly, the degree of violence displayed by the group - arm-locking, punching and kicking a helpless victim, was disproportionate to any alleged provocation.

38     I noted that the punishment prescribed for the offence committed by Francis is a mandatory imprisonment of up to 7 years and shall also be liable to caning. This indicated the gravity of the offence committed by Francis.

39     I was mindful of the injuries suffered by the victim. See \[11\] above.

40     I agreed with the Prosecution that there was public disquiet over the conduct of the Accused. “As a result of this incident, no less than 12 calls were made to the Police on the night of 27 November 2014. Apart from one of the callers being Rachel, the victim’s daughter, the rest were made by concerned neighbours in the vicinity.” See \[10\] of Prosecution’s submissions. In my view, such brazen act committed in a public residential housing estate clearly warranted a higher level of specific and general deterrence.

41     The Accused was not remorseful. It was not a case where he had pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity and thus spared the witnesses from having to testify at a trial. He had the opportunity to plead guilty and be sentenced on 16 November 2017 but Francis chose to claim trial. He was therefore not entitled to any discount in sentencing that would usually be accorded to those who had pleaded guilty at the first instance.

42     The circumstances of the case also suggested that the confrontation with the victim was premeditated. This was fortified by the fact that the co-accused called for reinforcement when they knew the victim was intoxicated and had uttered threatening words on them. It did not occur at the spur of moment as contended by counsel.

43     I also noted that the rioting offence was committed in the course of their professional duties as debt collectors. And I agreed with the Prosecution that the Accused would stand to profit from their debt collection.

44     I was also in full agreement with the Prosecution that the practices used by the accused were more egregious than unlicensed moneylending syndicates. I was strongly of the view that a strong signal must be sent to deter would be offenders. In fact, I have noted that there were already a number of such cases involving employees of other debt collection agencies being charged in court in respect of such thuggish practices.

45     I agreed with the Prosecution that a long custodial sentence was warranted as Francis was more culpable in that he had assaulted the victim. See \[9\] above. He was also traced for violence related offences. See \[27\] and \[28\] above. I was mindful that some of the antecedents of Francis were committed before the present s147 offence. But his antecedents clearly indicated his proclivity towards committing crimes. Hence specific deterrence was warranted.

46     Francis was first charged in court on 15 August 2014 and was released on bail. Bail was revoked on 1 September 2016. In between these 2 dates, Francis committed multiple offences for which he was sentenced on 16 November 2017. He elected to claim trial to this s147 charge but pleaded guilty to a series of diverse charges (19 in total) for which he was sentenced on 16 November 2017 and jailed for a global sentence of 4 years 2 months and a fine of $10,000 with 16 other offences which he admitted and consented to be taken into account for the purpose of sentencing. Some of the charges dealt with on 16 November 2017 were also in relation to debt collections and involved similar thuggish practices. See the following three charges:

47     It was submitted that there will be double jeopardy if the antecedents of the Accused were to be reconsidered again in respect of the s147 charge. I accepted the submission of the learned DPP that there was no issue of double jeopardy as the Accused was not prosecuted again for the same set of facts. I was of the view that the court was entitled to review the Accused’s antecedents to determine the appropriate sentence to be meted out for his current offence which was committed on 27 November 2014 while he was on bail and after he had been charged in court. This was clearly an aggravating factor.

## Section 147 Precedents

48     The Prosecution tendered a table of sentencing precedents on s147 Penal Code offence. It appeared that the sentencing range was from 12 months’ imprisonment to 3 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. No sentencing precedent was cited by counsel for Francis. In my view, the sentence will have to be determined in accordance with the facts of each case. See Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts, 3rd Ed, volume 1 at page 377. I was of the view that the circumstances of the present case relating to the commission of the rioting offence were different from the precedents cited by the Prosecution.

49     The Prosecution also referred to cases relating to unlicensed moneylenders. The present case was a rioting case that involved debt collection practices by debt collectors employed by a debt collecting company. As the present case was analogous to that of debt collection by unlicensed moneylenders, I agreed it would be helpful to refer to such cases, particularly of “the parallels and the negative consequences that unbridled debt collection practices may have on society at large.”. But I was also mindful that such offences attracted different punishments and sentencing considerations. This was stated so above.

50     In _Cheiu Poi Guan v PP (“Cheiu”), MA 9131/2017_, the High Court upheld a sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment meted out by the court below. The lower court’s judgment was reported in <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 191</span>. The Prosecution highlighted that this was the only case where the unlicensed moneylender assaulted the debtor. At the court below, the Appellant was convicted for an offence punishable under s 28(2)(a) read with s28(3)(b)(ii) of the MLA and s 109 of the Penal Code. The Appellant was not involved in the physical assault but had merely provided transportation to the assailant who had punched the victim once in the right cheek causing only bodily pain. This case involved only 2 offenders which was unlike the present case.

51     In the present case, “all five accused persons were directly involved in the group assault of the victim, which arose as a result of them attempting to collect a debt from the victim in the first place. The victim’s injuries were also far worse, involving bruises on his swollen face as was observed by multiple responding police officers as well as his family members at the time.” See Prosecution’s submissions at \[8\]. I also agreed with the Prosecution that both Francis and Yong were the most culpable as they made direct blows to the victim’s head. The assault was also protracted. Moreover, the accused persons were unrelenting in refusing to let go off the victim until when the victim’s daughter called for the police.

52     I was of the view that in the light of the sentencing factors considered above, a sentence of at least 3 years’ imprisonment was warranted. It was proportionate and reflected the Accused’s overall criminality.

## Sentence Proposed by Prosecution

53     In my judgment the sentence proposed by the Prosecution was manifestly inadequate and did not adequately give due weight to the need for specific deterrence.

54     I was of the view that Francis’ varied offences committed repeatedly over the years warranted a higher sentence than that submitted by the Prosecution and that imposed on the co- accused.

55     Francis had received a period of reformative training in the RTC when he was a teenager but it had no effect on him at all. He went on to re-offend multiple times. Whilst the antecedents were not directly similar, they were relevant in showing a continuing disobedience of the law. I was also very concerned that he committed the present offence soon after his release from prison after having served a jail term of 6 years 8 months and 5 strokes of the cane for drug trafficking and other drug related offences. Moreover, he committed the present offence despite having been charged in court on 15 August 2014 and while he was released on bail. He had to have his bail revoked on 1 September 2016 to prevent him from re-offending. See also \[28\] above. The commission of an offence whilst on bail is an aggravating factor: _PP v Logmanul Hakim Bin Buang <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR 753</span>_ at \[57\].

## Conclusion

56     In my view, Francis was clearly a menace to society and ought to be detained in custody for a substantial period of time for the protection of the public. It was also appropriate for this term of imprisonment to commence on the expiry of the current term of imprisonment imposed by the court on 16 November 2017.
