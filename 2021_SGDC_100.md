### District Judge Ng Tee Tze Allen:

1       In 1995, the late Ms Shirley Tan (the “**Deceased**”) made a revocable Life Insurance Policy No. XXX (the “**HSBC Policy**”). The plaintiff, Ms Tan Susie, was nominated its sole beneficiary (the “**Nomination**”). After the Deceased passed away, HSBC Insurance (Singapore) Pte Limited (“**HSBC**”) paid the sum of S$197,324.67 (the “**HSBC Proceeds**”) to the defendant, Mr Polo Wong, in his capacity as the executor of the Deceased’s estate. In so doing, HSBC discharged its liability under the HSBC Policy.

2       Competing claims have been made for the HSBC Proceeds. The plaintiff claimed the HSBC Proceeds on the basis of the Nomination. The defendant claimed the HSBC Proceeds for the estate on the basis that the Nomination was superseded by the wills that the Deceased made subsequently. He also argued that the Nomination did not give the plaintiff any right to the HSBC Proceeds in any event.

3       Having considered the evidence and the parties’ submissions, I dismissed the plaintiff’s claim.

## Background facts

4       The following facts are undisputed unless otherwise stated.

5       On 20 September 1995, the Deceased applied for HSBC Policy through her insurance agent, Ms Wong Sze Keed (“**Ms Wong**”). [^1] The HSBC Policy was issued on 27 December 1995 and it took effect from 1 January 1996.[^2] The plaintiff was nominated the sole beneficiary. In this respect, the HSBC Policy provided:

> _“The Beneficiary is as designated in Schedule Part II unless subsequently changed as provided for under the Change of Beneficiary clause._

> _Unless specifically provided otherwise, the interest of any Beneficiary who predeceases the Life Insured shall vest in the Insured”[^3]_

6       The Deceased could change the beneficiary by filing a written notice satisfactory to HSBC. If she did so, the change would take effect only if HSBC recorded the change. The Change of Beneficiary clause reads:

> _“During the lifetime of the Life Insured and while this policy is in force, the Insured may, by filing written notice satisfactory to the Company, change the Beneficiary of this policy._

> _A change of Beneficiary shall be effective only if recorded by the Company. When the Beneficiary is so changed, it will be deemed effective as of the date the notice is signed whether or not the Life Insured is living at the time of such recording.”[^4]_

The Deceased did not file a written notice per the Change of Beneficiary Clause.

7       In 2005, the Deceased contacted Ms Wong. According to Ms Wong, the Deceased told her that she (i.e. the Deceased) intended to leave her money to the defendant. Ms Wong told the Deceased that she could do so by making a will.[^5]

8       On 22 August 2005, the Deceased executed a will (the “**2005 Will**”).[^6] Therein, she revoked all former wills, codicils, and testamentary dispositions, and provided for the distribution of her assets.

9       On 13 December 2007, the Deceased executed a second will (the “**2007 Will**”).[^7] The parties agreed that this is the Deceased’s last will and testament. Therein, the Deceased revoked all former wills, codicils, and testamentary dispositions, provided for the distribution of her property, and appointed the defendant as the executor and trustee. The 2007 Will made no express reference to _any_ of the Deceased’s insurance policies.

10     On 18 August 2016, the Deceased passed away. On 21 December 2017 the defendant extracted the Grant of Probate as the Deceased’s sole executor.[^8]

11     In or around January 2018, HSBC paid the HSBC Proceeds to the defendant in his capacity as the executor and trustee of the Deceased’s estate. The defendant signed a Voucher of Discharge to discharge HSBC, from all further liability under, amongst other policies, the HSBC Policy.

12     On 21 August 2018, the plaintiff’s solicitors to wrote to the defendant to request, amongst other things, that the defendant “_account and pay to \[them\] as Solicitors for \[the plaintiff\] the \[HSBC Proceeds\] as soon as possible and in any event within 14 days from the date hereof_”.[^9]

13     The defendant refused and the plaintiff sued.

## The parties’ cases

14     The plaintiff’s claim to the HSBC Proceeds rested on her nomination as the sole beneficiary in the HSBC Policy. She sought amongst other things:

> (a)     a declaration that the defendant received the HSBC Proceeds from the HSBC as trustee for the plaintiff; and

> (b)     payment of the HSBC Proceeds to her.

15     The defendant resisted the plaintiff’s claim. He argued that:

> (a)     The plaintiff was no longer the beneficiary to the HSBC Policy because:

>> (i)       the Nomination was revoked when the Deceased executed the 2005 Will and/or the 2007 Will; and

>> (ii)       the beneficiary of the HSBC Policy was changed pursuant to the Change of Beneficiary Clause when the defendant submitted the Grant of Probate and the 2007 Will to HSBC.

> (b)     In any event, the plaintiff acquired no legal / equitable right to the HSBC Proceeds pursuant to the Nomination.

16     To succeed, the plaintiff needed to remain a beneficiary to the HSBC Policy and have acquired a legal / equitable right to the HSBC Proceeds under the Nomination. However, I found that she succeeded only on the first issue, but not the second.

## The plaintiff remained the Nominated Beneficiary of the HSBC Policy

### No revocation of Nomination

17     I started by considering the argument the Nomination was revoked by the 2005 Will and / or the 2007 Will.

18     As a preliminary point, both parties accepted that s 49M of the Insurance Act (Cap 142, 2002 Rev Ed) did not apply.[^10] I agreed. Broadly speaking, and amongst other things, s 49M permits a policy owner to revoke a nomination of a “_relevant policy”_ (as defined in s 49K) by will if the nomination was made in the prescribed form (i.e. Form 4 of the Insurance (Nomination of Beneficiaries) Regulations 2009): see s 49M(2) of the Insurance Act (Cap 142, 2002 Rev Ed) read with reg 3(2) and Form 4 of the Insurance (Nomination of Beneficiaries) Regulations 2009.

19     If the nomination is in the prescribed form, the policy owner can revoke it by making a will in accordance with the Wills Act (Cap 352, 1996 Rev Ed) which:

> (a)     provides for the disposition of all death benefits under the policy; and

> (b)     specifies the prescribed particulars of the policy: see s 49M(7)(b) of the Insurance Act (Cap 142, 2002 Rev Ed) read with reg 5(3) of the Insurance (Nomination of Beneficiaries) Regulations 2009.

20     In the present case, while the HSBC Policy was a “_relevant policy”_, the Nomination was not in the prescribed form. Further, neither the 2005 nor the 2007 Wills specified the prescribed particulars of the HSBC Policy. Instead, they had the following revocation clause:

> _“I revoke all former Wills, Codicils and Testamentary dispositions hereto before made by me and declare this to be my Last Will and Testament”_

21     As such, the defendant could not (and did not) rely on s 49M to argue that the Nomination was revoked. Instead, he argued that:

> (a)     The Deceased was entitled to revoke the Nomination by making a will because s 3(1) of the Wills Act (Cap 352, 1996 Rev Ed) provided that every person may “_devise, bequeath or dispose of by his will … all real estate and all personal estate”_:

>> _Property disposable by will_

>> _3.—(1_)     _Subject to the provisions of this Act, every person may devise, bequeath or dispose of by his will, executed in the manner required under this Act, all real estate and all personal estate which he shall be entitled to either at law or in equity at the time of his death._

> (b)     The Nomination was a testamentary disposition because the HSBC Policy is a life insurance policy and the HSBC Proceeds are “_payable only upon the \[Deceased’s\] death”_.[^11] He argued that _Re Barnes Ashenden v Heath_ \[1940\] 1 Ch D 267 (“**Re Barnes**”) supported him because Farwell J “_took the view that the power given to a member of a registered society to nominate a person to whom his property in the society shall be transferred at his decease is in its nature testamentary._”_[^12]_

> (c)     As the 2005 and/or 2007 Will contained the revocation clause that revoked all earlier testamentary dispositions, the Nomination was revoked.

22     In my judgment, little turned on whether the revocation clause in the 2005 Will or the 2007 Will was the operative clause. As both wills had the same revocation clause (see \[20\] above), assuming the revocation clause had that effect, the Nomination would have been revoked regardless. As such, the key issues were:

> (a)     whether s 3 of the Wills Act (Cap 352, 1996 Rev Ed) applied; and

> (b)     whether the Nomination was a “_testamentary disposition_” which fell within the ambit of the revocation clause.

23     On the first issue, I did not think that s 3 of the Wills Act (Cap 352, 1996 Rev Ed) assisted the defendant. I accepted the plaintiff’s submission that s 3 applied only to assets and properties that belonged to the testator, but this was not the case here.

> (a)     The HSBC Proceeds did not belong to the Deceased. Until they were paid, the HSBC Proceeds belonged to the HSBC. The Deceased’s right was to enforce the terms of the HSBC Policy.

> (b)     In this respect, the terms of the HSBC Policy also did not give the Deceased any right to receive the HSBC Proceeds. In her Proposal for Life Insurance, the Deceased nominated the plaintiff as the beneficiary and HSBC agreed to insure the Deceased on this basis. As such, unless she had invoked the Change of Beneficiary clause, the Deceased could only compel HSBC to pay the HSBC Proceeds to the plaintiff. However, she did not invoke the Change of Beneficiary clause in her lifetime.

24     On the second issue, I did not agree that the Nomination was a “_testamentary disposition_”. It is trite that a testamentary disposition can only dispose of property belonging to the testator at the time of his death: _Williams on Wills_ (Butterworths, London, Dublin, Edinburgh, 8th Ed, 2002) at para 7.17. However, for the reasons above, the Deceased was not disposing of her property. Indeed, _Re Barnes_ is distinguishable for this reason. Unlike the present case, there was no question that the member in _Re Barnes_ was dealing with her own property. She was making a nomination of approximately £100 which she had deposited with the registered society.

25     As such, the revocation clause (see \[20\] above) did not revoke the Nomination.

26     For completeness, it is incorrect for the defendant to argue that the Nomination was “_testamentary_” in nature simply because the HSBC Proceeds were “_payable only upon the \[Deceased’s\] death”_._[^13]_ Not all documents intended to operate on death are “_testamentary_”. The acid test is revocability: _Sheares Betty Hang Kiu v Chow Kwok Chi_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 2 SLR(R) 285</span> at \[28\]. This is clear from _Re Barnes_ itself. As Farwell J explained, the nomination in that case was “_testamentary_” because “_it has all the characteristics of a testamentary document, that is to say it is a nomination which has no effect at all until the death of the nominator who is left completely free during his lifetime to deal with his share”.[^14]_ That said, little turned on this point given my holding above.

### No change to beneficiary of the HSBC Policy

27     The next argument I had to consider was whether a change of beneficiary was effected under the Change of Beneficiary provision (see \[6\] above) when the defendant filed / submitted the Grant of Probate with the 2007 Will to HSBC.

28     I did not think so. The Change of Beneficiary provision (see \[6\] above) required the Deceased to file a written notice satisfactory to the HSBC in her lifetime. It did not permit changes to be made by the Deceased’s executor after her death. In the present case, the Deceased did not file any such written notice during her lifetime. Further and in any event, any change to the beneficiary took effect “_only if recorded by \[HSBC\]_” and there was no evidence that HSBC recorded any such change.

## The plaintiff has no beneficial interest in the HSBC Proceeds

29     For the reasons above, I found that the Nomination was not revoked / changed and that the plaintiff remained a beneficiary of the HSBC Policy. As such, the next issue I had to consider was whether the plaintiff had any legal / beneficial interest in the HSBC Proceeds and if the defendant held them on trust for the plaintiff.

### The Nomination did not give the plaintiff any beneficial interest

30     The plaintiff did not assert a legal right to the HSBC Proceeds. She only asserted an equitable right to it. In this respect, it was not her case that the terms of the HSBC Policy created an express trust in her favour. It was also not her case that a resulting trust arose because she paid the premiums for the HSBC Policy. Instead, her case was that a constructive trust arose because:

> (a)     She was nominated the beneficiary of the HSBC Proceeds. She argued that _Vaswani Roshni Anilkumar v Vaswani Lalchand Challaram_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 2 SLR(R) 257</span> (“**_Vaswani_**”) supported her; and

> (b)     As the HSBC Proceeds were paid to the defendant, he held them on trust for her.

31     I agreed that the defendant would hold the HSBC Proceeds on trust for the plaintiff assuming she was beneficially entitled to them. However, I did not agree that the Nomination gave her any such entitlement or that _Vaswani_ supported her.

32      _Vaswani_ is a case similar to ours. Simplifying the facts, the insured in _Vaswani_ purchased three insurance policies, naming his parent(s) the beneficiaries. After he died intestate, the question arose as to whether the parent(s) (as the named beneficiaries) or the insured’s estate was entitled to payment of the policy moneys from the insurer. The Court of Appeal held that neither were entitled to payment of the policy moneys because:

> (a)     The named beneficiaries were the insured’s parent(s), and not his wife or children. As such, no statutory trust was created under s 73(1) of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap. 61, 1994 Rev Ed): _Vaswani_ at \[7\].

> (b)     The parent(s) were not privy to the insurance policies. As such, they could not enforce insurance policies: _Vaswani_ at \[21\]. Notably, the parent(s) could not rely on the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act (Cap 53B, 2002 Rev Ed) because it came into effect after the policies were made: _Vaswani_ at \[10\].

> (c)     The terms of the insurance policies required payment to be made to the parent(s). As such, the estate was not entitled to sue for payment: _Vaswani_ at \[21\]

33     Applying _Vaswani_, it was difficult to see why the plaintiff would be entitled to the HSBC Proceeds:

> (a)     Like the parent(s) in _Vaswani_, the plaintiff was not the Deceased’s spouse or child. She was Deceased’s sister. As such, no statutory trust was created pursuant to s 73(1) of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap. 61, 1994 Rev Ed). For completeness, the plaintiff also could not rely on s 49L of the Insurance Act (Cap 142, 2002 Rev Ed) to argue that a statutory trust arose in her favour. Section 49L provides that a trust of policy money is created where a policy owner of a relevant policy: (i) nominates his spouse and/or child(ren) as the beneficiary(ies), (ii) expresses his intention to create a trust of the policy money, and (iii) makes the nomination in the prescribed form. However, none of these requirements were met.

> (b)     Like the parent(s) in _Vaswani_, the plaintiff was not privy to the HSBC Policy. She also could not rely on the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act (Cap 53B, 2002 Rev Ed) because it came into effect after the HSBC Policy was made. She also did not argue that some other exception to the privity rule applied. As such, I did not think that the plaintiff could enforce the HSBC Policy against HSBC.

34     Notwithstanding, the plaintiff argued that she was beneficially entitled to the HSBC Proceeds because the Court of Appeal held at _Vaswani_ \[21\] that “_the insurer is entitled to make payment to the father or the parents since that is in accordance with the terms of each contract”_.

35     I was unable to accept this argument. Not only had the Court of Appeal had rejected this argument at \[21\] of _Vaswani_, it held the reverse. At \[27\], the Court of Appeal stated that even though the “_parents are not, strictly speaking, entitled to receive payment … the insurer is discharged from its liability under the respective policies if the insurer pays the policy money to … the parents_”. Both paragraphs are reproduced in full:

> _21_      _On the facts before us, we are of the view that, strictly speaking, neither the parents nor the wife is entitled to the policy moneys. The parents are not entitled as they are not privy to the contract. The estate is not entitled because the terms of each contract require payment to the father or to both parents. As the estate is not entitled, then consequently, the wife, as a beneficiary of the estate, is also not entitled._ **_On the other hand, the insurer is entitled to make payment to the father or the parents since that is in accordance with the terms of each contract._** _In doing so, the insurer discharges its obligation under each contract._ **_Mr Sunil Singh, counsel for the parents, assumed that because the insurer is entitled to make payment to the parents, the parents are necessarily entitled to receive payment. As we have elaborated, this is not so in the present case_** _._

> _27_      _As the insurer is not denying liability to make payment, it is not necessary for us to find an exception to the doctrine of privity of contract or to rest our views on unjust enrichment to compel the insurer to pay._ **_In the circumstances, as the parents are not, strictly speaking, entitled to receive payment for lack of privity, we set aside the decision of Choo J stating that they are so entitled_** _. There are, however, some procedural complications. The insurer is no longer a party to the action. Although we would have normally refrained from making a declaration about the insurer’s right to pay the policy moneys or the discharge of the insurer’s obligation to pay such moneys, we will do so in the exceptional circumstances before us since it appears that the insurer wants such a declaration in any event._ **_Accordingly we declare that the insurer is discharged from its liability under the respective policies if the insurer pays the policy moneys under the First Policy to the father and under the Second and Third Policies to both the parents._** _”_

> (emphasis in bold)

36     Indeed, an insurer’s right to pay the insurance proceeds to the nominated beneficiary does not necessarily give the beneficiary the right to **_receive_** them. The beneficiary has the more limited right to **_retain_** the insurance proceeds assuming he received them. As John Birds, Ben Lynch, Simon Milnes, _MacGillivray on Insurance Law_ (Sweet & Maxwell, Thomson Reuters, 12th Ed, 2012) explained at para 25-059:

> _“A mere donee of the policy not being a beneficiary under a trust and not being a party to the contract has no claim to the policy moneys either at law or in equity, but if he actually receives the policy moneys he is entitled to retain them for his own use, and is not accountable further to the assured or his representative.”_

37     In the present case, however, the HSBC Proceeds was not paid to the plaintiff. They were paid to the defendant, as executor. In this respect, the Plaintiff did not suggest that HSBC had erred by paying the HSBC Proceeds to the defendant, as executor. Instead, she accepted this as common practice.[^15] Indeed, just because the HSBC Policy allowed HSBC to pay the HSBC Proceeds to the plaintiff did not mean that it had to. Section 61 of the Insurance Act (Cap 142, 2002 Rev Ed) also permitted HSBC to pay the HSBC Proceeds to the defendant, as executor, and to obtain a discharge by doing so:

> _“_ **_Payment of living benefits or death benefits under life policy or accident and health policy, etc._**

> _61.—(1) …_

> (_2_)     _In any case where the policy owner of any life policy or accident and health policy dies, and death benefits are payable under the policy on his death —_

>> (_a_)     _…_

>> (_b_)     **_if subsection (10) applies in respect of the policy, the licensed insurer of the policy may make one or more payments in accordance with subsections (10) and (11) from the death benefits under all such policies issued by the licensed insurer on the deceased’s life_** _in respect of which subsection (10) applies, such payment or payments not exceeding in the aggregate the amount prescribed by the Authority for the purposes of this paragraph, without the production of any probate or letters of administration; and_

>> (_c_)     **_the licensed insurer shall be discharged from all liability in respect of each such payment._** **”**

> _…_

> (_10_)   _Subject to subsection (11), where —_

>> (_a_)     _the policy owner of a policy referred to in subsection (2) or (3) has not made —_

>>> (_i_)     _any nomination under section 49L(2) or 49M(2) in respect of the policy; or_

>>> (_ii_)    _any will which —_

>>>> (_A_)     _provides for the disposition of all death benefits under the policy; and_

>>>> (_B_)     _specifies such particulars of the policy as may be prescribed by the Authority under section 49M(7)(b)(ii);_

> _…_

> _the licensed insurer of the policy may make a payment under subsection (2)(b) or (3) to any proper claimant from the death benefits under the policy.”_

> (_11_)   _Where subsection (10) applies, and the licensed insurer referred to in that subsection receives 2 or more different claims for payment in accordance with that subsection —_

>> (_a_)     _each such claim shall be paid in the same order of priority; and_

>> (_b_)     _the amount payable under subsection (2)(b) or (3), as the case may be, in respect of any such claim shall be calculated as follows:_

![]([2021] SGDC 0100_Image/[2021] SGDC 0100_image1.png)

>>> _where A is the amount which would have been payable in respect of that claim had it been paid in full;_

>>> _B is the total amount which would have been payable in respect of all such claims had they been paid in full; and_

>>> _C is the amount prescribed by the Authority for the purposes of subsection (2)(b) or (3), as the case may be._

> (_12_)   _In this section, unless the context otherwise requires —_

>> _…_

>> _“proper claimant” means a person who —_

>>> (_a_)     **_claims to be entitled to payment under subsection (2)(b) or (3) as executor of the deceased; or_**

>>> (_b_)     _claims to be entitled to payment under subsection (2)(b) or (3) (whether for his own benefit or not) and is the widower, widow, parent, child, brother, sister, nephew or niece of the deceased;”_

>>> _…”_

> (emphasis in bold)

### No reason to impose a constructive trust

38     The next issue was whether there are any other reason(s) to impose a constructive trust over the HSBC Proceeds for the plaintiff’s benefit. As the Court of Appeal held in _Ching Mun Fong (executrix of the estate of Tan Geok Tee, deceased) v Liu Cho Chit_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 1 SLR(R) 856</span> at \[36\], “_for a remedial constructive trust to arise, the payee’s conscience must have been affected, while the moneys in question still remain with him”._

39     In the present case, there did not appear to be any reason for the defendant’s conscience to be so affected.

40     First, the plaintiff did not have a better right to the HSBC Proceeds than the Deceased (or her estate). There were also no additional facts before me that would have allowed the plaintiff to compel the Deceased (or her estate) to pay the HSBC Proceeds to her (e.g. a contract between the plaintiff and the Deceased).

41     Second, the defendant had not acted inappropriately to either secure payment of the HSBC Proceeds or prevent payment to the plaintiff. In fact, the defendant’s unchallenged evidence demonstrated otherwise. In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, the defendant explained that he had “_informed the bank officer at HSBC that \[the Deceased\] had nominated the plaintiff as her beneficiary” [^16]_ and _“showed \[HSBC officer\] the Grant of Probate with the Will attached and \[his\] NRIC”.[^17]_ It also appeared that HSBC had obtained legal advice before paying the HSBC Proceeds to the defendant. As the defendant recounted, prior to the payment, “_the \[HSBC officer\] told \[the defendant\] that they would check with their own lawyers on who should be paid the \[HSBC Proceeds\]”.[^18]_

42     Third, there was no evidence that HSBC paid the HSBC Proceeds to the defendant on the basis that they would be paid to the plaintiff, that the defendant represented that he would do so, or that the defendant accepted payment on this basis. HSBC’s letter of 24 January 2018 simply stated that the HSBC Proceeds was being paid to the defendant as “_Executor of the Last Will of the deceased_”. HSBC did not direct the defendant to pay the HSBC Proceeds to the plaintiff. In a similar vein, the defendant’s Voucher of Discharge dated 31 January 2018 simply stated that he was acting in his capacity as executor. He did not say that he would pay the HSBC Proceeds to the plaintiff.

## Conclusion

43     For these reasons, I was unable to allow the plaintiff’s claims. Even though she remained the nominated beneficiary under the HSBC Policy, she did not acquire any substantive right to **_receive_** the HSBC Proceeds. She was not privy to the HSBC Policy and could not sue HSBC for it. Hers was the more limited right to **_retain_** the HSBC Proceeds assuming HSBC paid them to her. However, HSBC was not compelled to make such payment, and it did not do so. Instead, it paid the HSBC Proceeds to the defendant, as executor.

44     There was also no reason to impose a constructive trust over the HSBC Proceeds in the plaintiff’s favour. She did not have a better right to the HSBC Proceeds than the Deceased (or her estate), and this was not a case where the defendant obtained payment of the HSBC Proceeds using inappropriate means. The defendant also did not receive the HSBC Proceeds on the basis that he would pay them to the plaintiff or represent that he would do so.

45     Accordingly, I dismissed the plaintiff’s claim. Costs is to be agreed or fixed. Parties have liberty to write in should they be unable to agree on costs.
