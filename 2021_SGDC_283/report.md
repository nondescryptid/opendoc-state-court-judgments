### Deputy Registrar Hairul Hakkim:

## Introduction

1       The plaintiff’s claim arises out of a road traffic accident (“the Accident”) that occurred on 12 July 2015 when his motorcar was collided into by a motor lorry driven by the defendant.[^1]

2       By consent, interlocutory judgment (“IJ”) in favour of the plaintiff was entered on 28 March 2018 for the defendant to pay 95% of the plaintiff’s damages to be assessed, with costs to be reserved to the registrar hearing the assessment (“the AD Hearing”).

3       I conducted the AD Hearing over seven half-day tranches from 29 May 2019 to 15 June 2021 where the following witnesses gave oral evidence:

> (a)     the plaintiff;

> (b)     two medical experts appointed by the plaintiff, namely Prof Prem Kumar (“Prof Kumar”) and Dr Lee Keng Thiam (“Dr Lee”); and

> (c)     the defendant’s sole medical expert, Dr W C Chang (“Dr Chang”).

## Overview of plaintiff’s claims

4       The plaintiff claims for a total sum of $384,893.03 in the AD Hearing, which is broken down into various heads of claims as follows:[^2]

> (a)     general damages:

>> (i)       pain and suffering for neck injury: $14,000;

>> (ii)       pain and suffering for left shoulder injury: $10,000;

>> (iii)       pain and suffering for right shoulder rotator cuff tear: $15,000;

>> (iv)       pain and suffering for surgical scars: $3,000;

>> (v)       loss of amenities: $10,000;

>> (vi)       future medical expenses: $28,031.33; and

>> (vii)       loss of future earning (“LFE”): $204,793 or alternatively, $136,920; or

>> (viii)       loss of earning capacity (“LEC”): $204,793 or alternatively, $70,000.

> (b)     special damages:

>> (i)       medical expenses: $8,234.35;

>> (ii)       transport expenses: $500;

>> (iii)       pre-trial loss of earnings for unpaid hospitalisation leave: $550 (agreed); and

>> (iv)       additional pre-trial loss of earnings from 13 May 2019 to 15 June 2021: $40,750.

5       It is evident that the plaintiff’s total submissions on quantum exceed the jurisdiction of $250,000 provided for the District Court under s 19(4)(_a_) read with s 2 of the State Courts Act (Cap 321, 2007 Rev Ed) (“the State Courts Act”). The case was _not_ originally commenced in the High Court before being transferred to the District Court as part of the enhanced jurisdiction of the District Court for personal injury cases under s 2(_a_) of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Transfer of Specified Proceedings to District Court) Order 2016 (Cap 322, S 597/2016). There is also no agreement to enlarge the court’s jurisdiction under s 23 of the State Courts Act. In the circumstances, even if the plaintiff succeeds in proving his entitlement to each head of claim itemised above, the maximum amount he can recover from the defendant in the AD Hearing is $250,000.

6       I mention this at the outset because the plaintiff had only claimed for a total sum of $101,555.68 in the Joint Opening Statement (“JOS”) that was dated 29 May 2019 (_ie_, the date of the first tranche of the AD Hearing). Pertinently, this sum is significantly lower than the eventual submissions on quantum (_ie_, $384,893.03) made by the plaintiff in his closing submissions. While some departure from the opening statements may be tolerable on account of genuine errors, the departure in the present case must be specifically called out. Not only have certain claims been inflated by the plaintiff since the filing of the JOS (which was not at any point amended before the AD Hearing concluded), but also the plaintiff has now added fresh claims such as loss of amenities and additional pre-trial loss of earnings.

7       The purpose of an opening statement is to provide notice to opposing counsel in preparing for the trial as well as serve as the lodestar for the judge in assessing the evidence. Based on the opening statement and the claims and issues identified therein, the court would be able to focus on the evidence tendered, make the appropriate rulings on evidential objections, and ask the necessary questions to close gaps. However, where claims have been left out without good reasons and suddenly introduced only at the stage of closing submissions, dismissal of such claims may be warranted in appropriate cases.

8       In the recent decision of _Radhakrishnan Naidu s/o Balram v Esa’ri bin Samad_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 103</span>, DR Chua Wei Yuan disallowed a claim for future psychiatric treatment on the basis that the plaintiff had not claimed for the same in the _opening statement_ (at \[176\]). This aspect of the decision was upheld on Registrar’s Appeal by DJ Toh Yung Cheong in _Radhakrishnan Naidu s/o Balram v Esa’ri bin Samad_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 246</span> at \[58\]. As a further appeal to the High Court has been made against this decision which has not yet been concluded, I refrain from relying on this case in my decision. Instead, in my reasons that follow, I have dismissed some of the claims made by the plaintiff on the basis that these had not been pleaded and/or on the merits. Nevertheless, my preliminary observations made above remain relevant for the broader point that claims referenced in a party’s opening statement should not be inflated without good reasons in the closing submissions.

## Overarching issue on causation

9       Before I deal with the plaintiff’s claims for assessment, there is an overarching argument I must address. In the plaintiff’s closing submissions, the plaintiff contends that the defendant is estopped from arguing that certain injuries alleged by the plaintiff were caused by the Accident because of the IJ, citing the decision of the Court of Appeal in _Tan Woo Thian v PricewaterhouseCoopers Advisory Services Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 1 SLR 1166</span> (“_Tan Woo Thian_”).[^3] As I wished to consider this issue further, I invited parties to tender further written submissions on this issue. Having read the further submissions, I find that the plaintiff’s argument on causation is misguided. I will now elaborate further.

10     The plaintiff primarily relies on the following passages in _Tan Woo Thian_ to argue that the IJ estops the defendant from arguing a lack of causation in the AD Hearing:

> 6    … A cause of action in negligence is inchoate absent evidence of actual loss. This is distinct from the question of what the precise _quantum_ of such loss is. The appellant’s sole argument on causation, as set out in his Appellant’s Case at \[94\], was that the trial was bifurcated between liability and quantum, and that the case should go for assessment of damages if breach of a duty of care was made out.

> 7    The appellant’s contention in this regard is, with respect, incorrect. It wrongly conflates the separate questions of whether the appellant is able to establish that the respondent’s breach has _caused_ loss, with the _quantum_ of that loss. In order to even make out the tort of negligence, it must first be shown that the defendant’s breach has in fact _caused_ loss. As observed in _Winfield & Jolowicz on Tort_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 19th Ed, 2014) at para 7-002:

>> Even if the claimant proves every other element in tortious liability he will lose the action or, in the case of torts actionable per se, normally fail to recover more than nominal damages, if what the defendant did is not treated as a legal cause of his loss. **_This issue is logically distinct from and anterior to the question of measure of damages which will be dealt with at a later stage_**. Thus, in one of the leading cases, the issue was whether the defendants were liable for fire damage to a wharf which arose from a rather unusual chain of events after the defendants spilled oil into a harbour. If they had been liable (in fact they were not) the prima facie measure of damages would have been the cost of repairing the wharf plus consequential losses like loss of business … \[emphasis added in bold italics\]

> 8    It follows from this that if, and to the extent, the trial had been bifurcated between liability and quantum, then the plaintiff would not have been obliged to adduce evidence at the liability stage of the trial as to the quantification of the losses and injuries he claims he suffered. But, he would nonetheless have been obliged to show that he did, in fact, suffer one or more types of loss that was _causally connected_ to the alleged breach.

> \[emphasis in original\]

11     The question of whether the decision in _Tan Woo Thian_ precludes a party from mounting an argument of lack of causation at the hearing for assessment of damages has been recently considered by DR Lewis Tan in _Lim Mei Choo (Lin Meizhu) v Muhammad Azham bin Razak (Direct Asia Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd, intervener)_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGMC 74</span> (“_Lim Mei Choo_”). DR Tan, after noting the decision in _Tan Woo Thian_, discussed several cases (including personal injury cases) where causation of damages was considered by the courts at the assessment stage of proceedings (see _Lim Mei Choo_ at \[11\]–\[16\]). Eventually, DR Tan concluded as follows:

> 20    …\[C\]ausation is an essential element of liability for claims in negligence, and so it would be incongruent for a defendant to dispute causation _entirely_ (_ie_, as regards all heads of claim in negligence) at the assessment stage given that the interlocutory judgment entered by this stage would necessitate that _some_ damage and/or loss was caused by the defendant’s negligence. Nonetheless, **the defendant may continue to dispute causation as to ****_certain_** **(but not all) heads of claims at the assessment stage** (see the authorities discussed at \[12\]–\[16\] above). …

> 21    In this case, while the Intervener disputes causation as regards most heads of claim, it is undisputed that the Plaintiff should at least be entitled to the costs of her initial consultation with Dr Tan. This amounts to an implicit acceptance that at least _some_ loss or damage was caused by the Defendant’s negligence, and is consistent with the Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim, where she claims for medical and transport expenses under her “Particulars for Loss and Damage”. This accords with the authorities discussed above, which show that **causation can reasonably be disputed at the assessment of damages phase as long as at least ****_some_** **damage or loss was caused by the defendant’s negligence.** …

> \[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold\]

12     I agree with the position adopted in _Lim Mei Choo_. The Court of Appeal in _Tan Choo Thian_ did not state that **_all_** of the plaintiff’s claims for losses have to be proved at the trial on liability. All that is required for a matter to proceed to the assessment stage is for **_some_** of the plaintiff’s losses to be proved. The reason why the appellant in _Tan Woo Thian_ was unable to cross the causation hurdle was because he was unable to produce _any_ evidence on **_all_** the heads of losses claimed by him. This much is clear from the following observation made by the Court of Appeal in _Tan Woo Thian_ at \[11\]:

> …\[I\]t was patently obvious that the appellant had failed to discharge his burden of establishing that **_any_** of the alleged heads of loss had, as a matter of fact, been **caused** by the respondent’s alleged breaches of duty. \[emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in bold italics\]

13     It follows that a trial judge does not need to make a finding that _all_ of the plaintiff’s damages in a negligence claim were caused by the defendant’s breach of duty of care before ordering an interlocutory judgment in favour of the plaintiff – what is required is only evidence that _some_ loss was caused by the defendant’s breach (see also _Lim Ai Bee v Da-Cin Construction Co Ltd (Singapore Branch) and another_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 227</span> at \[188\]). I accordingly find that there is no merit to the plaintiff’s argument that the defendant is estopped (whether by way of _res judicata_, abuse of process or otherwise) from arguing that _some_ of the injuries allegedly suffered by the plaintiff were not caused by the Accident simply by virtue of the IJ.

14     I turn now to address each of the claims mounted by the plaintiff.

## General damages

### Neck injury

15     The plaintiff claims the sum of $14,000 for allegedly suffering from Grade 3 whiplash injury.[^4] This is one instance of a marked departure from the JOS by the plaintiff as he had initially submitted for a much lower figure of $6,000 instead in the JOS. There is no explanation given by the plaintiff for this departure. It is also puzzling why this figure has been substantially revised as there is no new medical evidence that surfaced in relation to the plaintiff’s neck injury since the filing of the JOS.

16     The defendant does not dispute the plaintiff’s neck injury save that it contends that the quantum awarded for this injury should instead be lesser at a sum of $3,500.[^5]

17     It is also common ground between the parties that the plaintiff’s neck injuries had resolved within two to six months of the Accident.[^6]

18     According to the medical report of Dr Lee dated 11 January 2016, the plaintiff had experienced the following symptoms associated with his neck injury during his several visits to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (“TTSH”):[^7]

> (a)     On the day after the Accident, there was tenderness elicited at the paravertebral neck muscles with good range of motion.

> (b)     On 16 July 2015, the plaintiff complained of neck pain radiating to his left trapezius and left shoulder.

> (c)     On 29 July 2015, there was tenderness elicited at the cervical spine and paravertebral muscles on both sides.

> (d)     On 8 October 2015 (_ie_, less than three months after the Accident), there was improvement reported in respect of the plaintiff’s neck pain and the plaintiff pertinently _declined to undergo further scans for his cervical spine_.

> (e)     On 5 January 2016, it was reported that the plaintiff’s neck injury had “largely recovered with no significant pain” and that the “\[r\]ange of neck motion was good.”

19     Based on the above, I find that the plaintiff did not suffer from any further neck pain after 5 January 2016 or suffer from any permanent residual disability because of this injury.

20     The relevant range of awards for neck injuries as stated in Charlene Chee _et al_, _Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases_ (Academy Publishing, 2010) (“the Guidelines”) are as follows (at pp 19–20):

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="74.76%"> <col width="25.24%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Description (Severity of Injury)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Range of awards</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><u>(b) Moderate</u></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(ii) Moderate whiplash injury classified as <em>Grade 3 whiplash injury</em>.

> \[emphasis added in italics and bold italics\]

21     It would be apparent from my foregoing analysis that the plaintiff’s neck injuries are miles apart from the type of injuries that would be considered as a Grade 3 whiplash injury. In fact, Dr Lee, the treating doctor for the plaintiff’s neck injury, did not even classify the plaintiff’s neck injury as a Grade 3 whiplash injury. Instead, I find that the plaintiff’s neck injury more accurately falls within the lower to mid-range of Minor category (c)(ii) – the plaintiff’s neck pain had fully resolved within five months with _no_ residual disabilities on a long-term basis, risk of degenerative changes or need for future treatment.

22     It is also telling that the plaintiff had initially adopted the same classification of Minor category (c)(ii) in the JOS. For completeness, the defendant’s submission that the plaintiff’s injury falls between the higher end of Minor category (c)(iii) and lower end of (c)(ii) is unprincipled given that the plaintiff’s neck injury had lasted for a duration beyond “few weeks”.

23     All the precedents highlighted by the plaintiff[^8] in support of its claimed figure of $14,000 are easily distinguishable as these cases either concerned permanent residual disabilities and/or aggravation of existing cervical spondylosis and/or degeneration with the need for future treatment to the neck.

24     Based on the foregoing and bearing in mind the dated age of the Guidelines (_ie_, reproduced in 2010), I find that a sum of **$6,000** would be the most appropriate award for the plaintiff’s pain and suffering for his neck injury.

### Left shoulder injury

25     The plaintiff claims the sum of $10,000 for his pain and suffering on account of allegedly suffering from a left shoulder contusion with residual disability in the form of restrictions on the range of his motion and tenderness of left trapezius and paraspinal muscle.[^9]

26     The defendant contends that there was no contusion to the plaintiff’s left shoulder and that the plaintiff only suffered a left shoulder sprain.[^10] The defendant further contends that there is an overlap of neck and left shoulder injury and that the injury to the left shoulder had resolved between two to six months.[^11]

27     I partly agree with the defendant that there is no basis for me to find that the plaintiff had suffered from a left shoulder contusion for two reasons. First, the plaintiff agreed during cross-examination that he did not injure his left shoulder or fall on his left shoulder during the Accident.[^12]

28     Second, even though there was an impression of “left shoulder contusion” in the plaintiff’s Multi-Disciplinary Progress Notes dated 29 July 2015 from TTSH,[^13] Dr Lee clarified during cross-examination that an impression is only “a possible diagnosis; not confirmative”.[^14] In particular, Dr Lee helpfully confirmed that it is “unlikely” for the plaintiff to have suffered a left shoulder contusion from the Accident as follows:[^15]

>   
| 

Q:

 | 

Contusion is where there is a knock?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

DC:

 | 

But here his car was hit from the right side, so how could there be a knock to the left shoulder?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

It can happen. It all depends on what is the impact and where the patient is. I have seen patients hit the steering wheel. Nothing is impossible.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

But it is abit unusual given that he was hit from the right side?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

It is **_unlikely_** for him to have hit his left shoulder on the car door. I agree.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

Until 29 July 2015, there is no record in the medical notes that the patient had knocked his left shoulder against anything?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

That means that there is no evidential basis for this impression?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

**_I don’t think “contusion” is the right term here._**

 |
| 

\[emphasis added in bold italics\]

 |

  
  

Dr Lee’s responses are indeed consistent with his medical report dated 11 January 2016 wherein he had made the diagnosis that the plaintiff sustained a “left shoulder sprain” (and not contusion).[^16]

29     As for the severity of the left shoulder sprain, I note that the plaintiff continued to suffer from pain in the left shoulder with mild restriction by pain in the left shoulder range of motion during his review on 5 January 2016.[^17] This was about five months after the Accident. There is no evidence before me that the plaintiff continued to suffer from pain or any residual disabilities in his left shoulder after 5 January 2016 or any medical evidence that he was likely to suffer from further pain or any other residual disabilities in his left shoulder after that time. Indeed, Prof Kumar confirmed during cross-examination that the plaintiff had recovered from his other injuries (_ie_, neck and left shoulder injuries) by the time the plaintiff had consulted him.[^18] Further, as with the plaintiff’s neck condition (see \[18(d)\] above), Dr Lee stated during cross-examination that he had ordered Magnetic Resonance Imaging (“MRI”) scans for the plaintiff’s left shoulder but the plaintiff _chose_ not to go for these scans.[^19]

30     Based on these parameters, I turn now to assess the relevant quantum of award for the left shoulder sprain. The relevant range of awards are stated in the Guidelines as follows (at p 33):

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="74.76%"> <col width="25.24%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Description (Severity of Injury)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Range of awards</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><u>Moderate</u></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Under this category, the injuries result in <em>substantial restriction of movement</em> (rotation) of the shoulder, <em>ie</em>, frozen shoulder. It also includes rotator cuff injuries where there are slight/partial tears in the tendons which can be treated conservatively. Symptoms persist for about two years but prognosis for full resolution is good.</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$2,000 to $10,000</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><u>Minor</u></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Soft tissue injury with initial considerable pain but complete recovery is achieved within <em>one or two years</em> with <em>no residual disabilities</em>.</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Less than $2,000</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

> \[emphasis added\]

31     In my judgment, the plaintiff’s injuries to his left shoulder fall within the upper end of the Minor category (as opposed to the Moderate category) for the following reasons:

> (a)     The evidence suggests that the plaintiff had recovered from his left shoulder injury within _five_ months of the Accident (_ie_, within one or two years of the Accident) with no evidence of any “substantial” _restriction_ of movement.

> (b)     There is no evidence of any residual permanent disabilities arising from the left shoulder injury or of any tears in the plaintiff’s left shoulder.

> (c)     Nevertheless, the upper end of the Minor category is appropriate given the restriction in the plaintiff’s range of motion for a period of five months and the tenderness elicited. To be clear, to avoid any overlap with the neck injury, I have not considered the plaintiff’s radiating neck pain to his left shoulder in assessing the quantum for the plaintiff’s left shoulder injury.

32     Based on the foregoing and again bearing in mind the vintage of the Guidelines, I find that a sum of **$2,500** is reasonable compensation for the plaintiff’s pain and suffering for this injury.

### Right shoulder

33     The plaintiff claims to have suffered as a result of the Accident the following injuries in his right shoulder (these injuries were documented in the MRI scan dated 9 December 2015):[^20]

> (a)     partial thickness articular sided tear at the posterior supraspinatus and anterior infraspinatus tendon with tear of the posterosuperior labrum and chondral abnormality in the superior glenoid cartilage;

> (b)     intra-osseous posterosuperior glenoid paralabrum cyst (no definite encroachment on the superior glenoid notch and no denervation related changes or atrophy of supraspinatus or infraspinatus muscles);

> (c)     partial thickness tear in the superior subscapularis – background generalised rotator cuff tendinosis; and

> (d)     mild fluid distension of SASD bursa.

#### Causation

34     The defendant’s primary argument in relation to the right shoulder injury is predicated on the lack of causation. Relying on Dr Chang’s opinion, the defendant contends that the injuries to the plaintiff’s right shoulder are degenerative in nature and not caused by the Accident.[^21]

35     The determination of this issue requires a close consideration of the opinions provided by the various medical experts. In doing so, I am mindful of the salutary reminder from the Court of Appeal in _Armstrong, Carol Ann (executrix of the estate of Peter Traynor, deceased, and on behalf of the dependents of Peter Traynor, deceased) v Quest Laboratories Pte Ltd and another and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 133</span> at \[90\]:

> …

> …\[A\] court is not bound to accept an expert’s opinion merely because it is uncontroverted. However, a court may find that it should accept uncontroverted expert evidence _if the opinion was grounded on a sound basis_. Hence, it appears to us that the question of whether to accept or reject an expert’s evidence is ultimately not a question of whether and how the evidence is controverted, but whether any eventual view arrived at is supportable in logic and evidence. The court’s determination as to whether it should accept parts of an expert’s evidence (and if so which parts) is guided by considerations of consistency, logic and coherence (see _Sakthivel Punithavathi v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 983</span> at \[75\]–\[76\]). This requires a scrutiny of the expert’s methodology and the _objective facts_ he had based his opinion upon (see the High Court decision of _PP v Choo Peng Kuen_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 230</span> at \[64\]). \[emphasis in original\]

36     Based on my analysis of the evidence given by Dr Lee, Prof Kumar, and Dr Chang, I find that the plaintiff has proven on a balance of probabilities that the _partial thickness tear at his posterior supraspinatus tendon_ in his right shoulder arose because of the Accident. However, I am unable to find that the other two tears in his right shoulder were caused by the defendant’s negligence. I elaborate further below.

37     I start first with Dr Lee’s evidence. Dr Lee initially opined in his specialist medical report dated 11 January 2016 that he was “unable to determine whether \[the plaintiff’s right shoulder pain\] is related to the \[A\]ccident” as the pain had started many weeks after the Accident.[^22] However, when Dr Lee first gave evidence on 3 September 2020, he was able to articulate with confidence that the plaintiff’s partial thickness tear at the posterior supraspinatus tendon is likely to be caused by the Accident.[^23]

38     The reason for his change in opinion, as explained by Dr Lee, was due to his discovery of the physiotherapy reports with TTSH (“Physiotherapy Reports”). These reports documented that the plaintiff had in fact complained of pain in his right shoulder as early as 1 September 2015 (_ie_, less than two months after the Accident). Before this, Dr Lee was only aware that the plaintiff had complained of his right shoulder pain on 8 October 2015 (_ie_, about three months after the Accident). Dr Lee explained that he did not have sight of the Physiotherapy Reports when he penned his opinion in the specialist medical reports and only looked at the Physiotherapy Reports before preparing for his evidence in the AD Hearing:[^24]

> Q:    You said that the \[Physiotherapy Reports\] led to your judgment to change your opinion. Why?

> A:    Initially, when I looked at the doctor’s reports, there was no documentation of \[the right shoulder pain\] and I assumed that the pain only started in October \[2015\] and thought I cannot comment on whether it is related to the \[A\]ccident. But when preparing for the court case, I looked through all the documents and available notes within the hospital, including the \[Emergency Department\] notes and \[Physiotherapy Reports\] and I realised that the timeline was much earlier and that the patient had right shoulder pain way earlier on 1 September 2015. …

39     The defendant contends that Dr Lee did not provide any explanation as to why his earlier hesitation to draw a causal link between the right shoulder pain and the Accident due to the passage of time from the Accident to when he initially thought the plaintiff had first complained of right shoulder pain on 8 October 2015 did not apply if the complaint had been made earlier on 1 September 2015.[^25] With respect, this submission stems from an incomplete consideration of Dr Lee’s evidence. In fact, Dr Lee answered, in response to defendant’s counsel question as follows:[^26]

> Q:    If these are tears caused by trauma, the plaintiff should have experienced pain and distress in his right shoulder?

> A:     _It may not be immediate_. I have had patients who had injuries weeks ago before the pain surfaced. _Small tears are usually not symptomatic_ but it is the subsequent inflammation that slowly leads to the pain. If we look at the fourth para from the bottom at ABD33, this is an example of inflammation.

> Q:    What is a reasonable timeframe between the trauma and pain?

> A:     _Probably around 2 months_. But it all depends on the pain threshold of patients. It also depends on the activities of the patient and usually happens when a patient lifts up \[_sic_\] his hand. For instance, playing badminton.

> \[emphasis added\]

In my view, Dr Lee’s logic for the change in his opinion is convincing. If the plaintiff had first complained of right shoulder pain to his physiotherapist on 1 September 2015, it is likely that the pain would have developed slightly earlier sometime in or around late August 2015. This would squarely fall within the “two months” reasonable timeframe provided by Dr Lee.

40     The defendant also contends that the Dr Lee had taken the following irrelevant considerations[^27] into account in arriving at his opinion on causation:[^28]

> Q:    Do you agree with my suggestion that in the ideal world, we need to look at the MRI scans before the accident?

> A:    Yes. The reason why I changed the opinion as to the likely cause of the right shoulder injury is because of the \[P\]hysiotherapy \[Reports\] and circumstantial evidence.

> Q:    What kind of circumstantial evidence?

> A:    I have seen many patients before. Patients who are keen to maximise their claim will hardly admit to near or full recovery of their injury. It is always largely only pain they complain about and which we cannot verify. His neck pain and left shoulder pain had improved a lot. We ordered the MRI scans for him but he chose not to go for the scans even though it would be for his advantage. In my assessment, this is not a patient who wants to maximise his claims. Number 2, all patients want to get well in general but a malingering patient will not volunteer the right history to us and I don’t see any evidence of the plaintiff here constantly changing history.

41     I agree with the defendant that Dr Lee should not have based his medical opinion on his assessment of the plaintiff’s behaviour and/or his truthfulness. If that is the only or primary basis on which Dr Lee had formed his opinion on causation, I would have no hesitation to disregard his opinion. However, from a close consideration of the evidence, that is not the only basis for Dr Lee’s medical opinion. In addition to Dr Lee’s basis predicated on the reasonable timeframe (see \[39\] above), Dr Lee also considered the probability of Dr Chang’s opinion on degeneration unrelated to the Accident (see \[46\] below) and articulated that this theory is unlikely given the MRI findings as follows:[^29]

> Q:    Given that this patient has a history of right shoulder injury pre-accident, it would be relevant and important to look at his condition before the accident before concluding what caused the tear?

> A:    Ideally, we have to have before and after. When we don’t have that, we have to make a clinical assessment. If we refer to the MRI report (ABD33), _I want to point out some things that I based my findings on_. The third para from the bottom, first sentence. The doctor who did the acromioplasty has done a good job and despite the passage of a long time, the acromial has remained flat – irritation on the rotator cuff is caused by a spur that sticks out. The second para after the findings – partial thickness tear – tears that are caused by acromial hook or spur or impingement basically occurs on the top side (bursal) side – if it is related to the surgery, the tear would be more on the top side rather the bottom side. In a traumatic injury, it can in general side be on either side. In order to help the court, _it is true that you can also have degenerative changes on the articular side (bottom side) but here, it is my opinion_ **_that it is unlikely to be related to his former condition because the location of the tear is different and the acromial has been flat over the years_**_._

> Q:    Referring to the same sentence at second sentence after findings. What kind of trauma the plaintiff has to go through to sustain these tears as described?

> A:     _Partial thickness tear are not big tears and can occur from a sudden jerk_ and that is because the tendons are not healthy. In a patient that is middle-aged, it is quite common for patients to have small tears from minor injuries and can be from simple things like lifting something.

> \[emphasis added in italics and bold italics\]

42     Lastly, Dr Lee also came across as a helpful medical expert who, cognisant of the limitations in science, was careful not to overstate his opinions. For instance, Dr Lee qualified that based on the MRI scans, he is _unable_ to confirm which of the three tears suffered by the plaintiff is directly related to the Accident but that it is likely that “at least one of the three tears, is caused by the \[A\]ccident”.[^30] He then went on to opine that it is the tear in the plaintiff’s right shoulder supraspinatus tendon that is likely to be related to the Accident:[^31]

> Q:    So what is your diagnosis now of his right shoulder?

> A:    I can’t confirm which of the three tears \[is related to the Accident\]. But I think it is likely that he has an acute tear of his right shoulder supraspinatus tendon.

43     Overall, I find that Dr Lee’s medical opinion on causation to be consistent, coherent, and well-supported in logic and the objective evidence.

44     Next, turning to the opinion of Prof Kumar, he stated in his specialist medical report dated 16 January 2018 that the “cuff tear was probably sustained at the time of the \[A\]ccident\]”.[^32] However, the defendant contends that during cross-examination, Prof Kumar agreed to defer to the opinion of TTSH and Dr Lee as to whether the right shoulder injury is related to the Accident.[^33]

45     Notwithstanding the fact that Prof Kumar remarked that he would defer to the opinion of TTSH and Dr Lee as they had the full history of the plaintiff’s injuries from the Accident,[^34] Prof Kumar also provided a sound basis for coming to his _independent_ opinion that the right shoulder injury is related to the Accident as follows:[^35]

> Q:    Can you explain your medical basis for your opinion at ABD, page 45, (c) \[_ie_, that the cuff tear was probably sustained at the time of the \[A\]ccident\]?

> A:    First, he has pain in the shoulder. Second, he had an injury to the shoulder. Third, the MRI, taken after the accident, showed a \[cuff\] tear.

46     As against the opinions of both Dr Lee and Prof Kumar, Dr Chang’s opinion is that all the tears in the plaintiff’s right shoulder are degenerative in nature and are unrelated to the Accident.[^36] Dr Chang clarified during cross-examination that the “main basis” for his opinion is due to the absence of any “documented record of the plaintiff suffering from right shoulder pain after the \[A\]ccident”.[^37] Consistent with this position, Dr Chang even noted that if the plaintiff had developed pain on the same day of the Accident, he would agree that the injury to his right shoulder arose from the Accident:[^38]

> Q:    Why would you have \[asked for the Physiotherapy Reports\]?

> A:    It will give me more information when I write my report. _If the therapist had stated that the pain started from day 1, I would agree that it came from the accident._

> Q:    But 1 September 2015 pain is not good enough?

> A:    Given the lapse of time, I am _unable_ to say whether the right shoulder injury is related to the accident.

> \[emphasis added\]

47     At this point, it is helpful to cross-reference Dr Chang’s opinion that the plaintiff should have suffered immediate pain with Dr Lee’s opinion that the pain may not be immediate in the case of _small_ tears in the rotator cuff (see \[39\] above). When this opinion of Dr Lee was suggested to Dr Chang, Dr Chang’s opinion was internally inconsistent as follows \[focusing on the words emphasised in bold italics below\]:[^39]

> Q:    In a case of small rotator cuff tear, Dr Lee had said that a patient would not develop pain immediately after the accident and it is usual for a patient to develop the pain 2 months later when there is inflammation?

> A:    I agree partially. We must look at the plaintiff’s shoulder pathology. The plaintiff has previous right shoulder injury for which he had two surgeries in 1988 and 1992. When you do acromioplasty, you usually remove some spurs that are impinging on the rotator cuff. That would imply that he had some pathology of the rotator cuff. Following this MRI, it shows small tears – there are more than one tendons at 1ABD33. **_I agree with you that small tears may not cause much pain_**. But _given that three tendons are engaged, it is impossible not to have any pain in the initial stages_. So the MRI findings would suggest that these tendons, based on the plaintiff’s previous pathology, are small degenerative tears unrelated to any trauma.

> Q:    You agree that _if there is a_ **_small rotator cuff tear_**_, that would in itself not cause immediate pain?_

> A:     **_No, you will get inflammation once it is torn_**.

> Q:    Dr Lee’s evidence is that when there is a tear, he said that _one would not feel pain until there is an inflammation_? Do you disagree?

> A:     **_No_**, _inflammation usually comes after the tear_. I disagree with Dr Lee because it goes against total pathology.

> \[emphasis added in bold italics and italics\]

48     It would be evident from the above exchange that while Dr Chang initially agreed that small tears may not cause much pain, he subsequently changed tack to say that that there would be _immediate_ inflammation (and pain) even after a small tear. Further, unlike Dr Lee, who could articulate his opinion based on his personal experience of dealing with patients who only experienced inflammation weeks after the injury (see \[39\] above), Dr Chang’s opinion is unsubstantiated. There is also no explanation provided by Dr Chang as to why the fact that three tendons being engaged in the plaintiff’s right shoulder would mean that it is “impossible” not to have immediate pain when he had agreed that a small tear on its own may not cause immediate pain.

49     From the foregoing, I am convinced that the plaintiff suffered a partial thickness tear at his posterior supraspinatus tendon in his right shoulder because of the Accident. I turn now to assess the quantum for this injury.

#### Quantum

50     The plaintiff submits for a sum of $15,000 for his pain and suffering for the right shoulder injury,[^40] whilst the defendant submits for a sum of $10,000.[^41]

51     In assessing the quantum, I take into account the following:

> (a)     the plaintiff’s complaints of right shoulder pain in the Physiotherapy Reports on 1 September 2015;[^42]

> (b)     the medical notes from TTSH taken on 8 October 2015 that the plaintiff’s right shoulder range of movement was limited by pain, the pain was worse at night and that the plaintiff could not drive properly;[^43]

> (c)     the specialist medical reports of Dr Lee[^44] and Prof Kumar[^45] confirming the plaintiff’s right shoulder injury from the MRI scan;

> (d)     the debridement surgery conducted by Prof Kumar on 7 April 2016[^46] to relieve the plaintiff’s symptoms in his right shoulder;

> (e)     the shared opinions of both Prof Kumar[^47] and Dr Chang[^48] that the injuries to the plaintiff’s right shoulder are likely to be permanent;

> (f)     Dr Chang’s recent assessment that the loss of full abduction and flexion in the plaintiff’s right shoulder would make performing overhead activities difficult and that the plaintiff would face difficulties driving for long hours;[^49] and

> (g)     my finding above that only one out of the three tears is attributable to the Accident (see \[49\] above).

52     While the plaintiff additionally testified that he has been on regular follow-up with Prof Kumar for his right shoulder condition since 2016,[^50] I place no weight on this testimony given that he failed to follow up with the relevant records. If it is indeed true that he has been on regular follow-up with Prof Kumar, it would clearly have been in his interests to provide continuing discovery of the medical invoices not only for the purposes of this claim but also for the other heads of claim such as medical expenses for both pre-trial and future losses. However, the plaintiff failed to provide such records.

53     Further, the plaintiff’s reliance on the two precedents cited in the closing submissions[^51] in support of a claimed figure of $15,000 is misplaced:

> (a)     First, the case precedent of _Teo Hock Leong William v SMRT Buses Ltd_ (DC Suit No 1200 of 2013) is unhelpful as it concerned a “_full_ thickness tear of \[the\] supraspinatus tendon” \[emphasis added\] (see _Practitioners’ Library – Assessment of Damages: Personal Injuries and Fatal Accidents_ (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2017) (“_Practitioners’ Library_”) at p 443) – it is undisputed that the plaintiff here only suffered a _partial_ thickness tear.

> (b)     Second, the decision in _Ting Heng Mee v Sin Sheng Fresh Fruit Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGHC 43</span> should also be distinguished as AR Vincent Leow _expressly_ made clear in this case that the sum of $13,500 awarded as general damages for a “partial tear of the supraspinatus tendon with tendinopathy” also factored in the cost of possible _future surgery_, for which the medical evidence showed that there was a 30% chance that plaintiff may require future surgery (at \[21\]–\[22\]). In contrast, the plaintiff here is claiming for future medical expenses as a _distinct_ head of claim.

54     The relevant range of awards for shoulder injuries are referred to in the Guidelines as follows (at pp 32–33):

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="74.76%"> <col width="25.24%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Description (Severity of Injury)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Range of awards</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><u>Serious</u></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Cases under this category include dislocation of the shoulder, <em>chronic shoulder</em> and neck pain, pain radiating down from the shoulder to the arms and weakness of grip that is <em>unlikely to improve in the future despite physiotherapy</em>. It also includes cases where there is a <em>complete tear of the rotator cuff tendons requiring surgery to repair the same</em>.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$10,000 to $15,000</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><u>Moderate</u></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Under this category, the injuries result in <em>substantial restriction</em> of movement (rotation) of the shoulder, <em>ie</em> frozen shoulder. It also includes rotator cuff injuries where there are <em>light/partial tears in the tendons which can be treated conservatively</em>. Symptoms persist for <em>about two years</em> but prognosis for full resolution is good.</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$2,000 to $10,000</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

> \[emphasis added\]

55     Here, the plaintiff’s sole tear in question which I have found to be attributable to the defendant’s negligence is only a _partial_ tear and not a full tear. Nevertheless, considering the unchallenged medical evidence on permanent incapacitation for the plaintiff arising from his right shoulder injuries but also being conscious that the residual disabilities appear to be minor in nature, I find that the plaintiff’s injuries fall somewhere between the Serious and Moderate end of the Guidelines for right shoulder injuries. I accordingly award the plaintiff the sum of **$12,000**.

### Surgical Scars

56     The final head of claim for pain and suffering is for the sum of $3,000 for the pain and suffering of the plaintiff in connection with the two 1 cm, surgical scars on his right shoulder.[^52] Both these surgical scars arose in the process of the debridement surgery conducted by Prof Kumar.[^53]

57     In the alternative to the argument on causation, the defendant contends that a sum of $1,500 would be reasonable compensation, given the size and location of the scars.[^54]

58     Given my decision on causation above, it follows that an award should be made for this injury. In this regard, the Guidelines provide for a range of $1,500 to $3,000 for single or minor scars with the following overarching commentary (at p 57):

> The higher range of the award is appropriate in cases where the scars are huge and unlikely to be removed completely even with cosmetic surgery and the injured person is a young female.

59     There is no evidence before me as to whether the scars could be removed by surgery and I am therefore unable to make that assessment here. Further, the sole precedent cited by the plaintiff[^55] is unhelpful as it concerned a very _young_ victim who experienced “scar ‘weeping’, which may require a wound reconstruction _surgery in future_” \[emphasis added\], and there is also no information available on the size of the two surgical scars in this precedent (see _Goh Fen Ji Mervin (an infant suing by his father and next friend Go Lip Ming) v Yeo Tze Phern_ (DC Suit No 1686 of 1999), cited in _Practitioners’ Library_ at 748).

60     In the present case, given the small size of the two scars, the plaintiff’s gender and age, and the ease of concealment of the two scars, I find that a sum of **$2,000** is appropriate for his pain and suffering.

### Loss of amenities

61     The next head of claim is for loss of amenities for the sum of $10,000. This head of claim was not referenced by the plaintiff in the JOS. In any event, I am not convinced that it is appropriate for a _separate_ award of loss of amenities to be made in this case. As stated in the _Practitioners’ Library_ at paras 5-42 to 5-43:

> …It appears that the courts usually only make a separate award for loss of amenities in _extreme cases_ — for example, total blindness, paraplegia, or impotence and impaired libido (see, for example, _Denis Matthew Harte v Dr Tan Hun Hoe & Anor_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] SGHC 248</span>). The courts will look at the particular plaintiff, the circumstances of each case and the evidence to see how his quality of life has been diminished, on a case by case basis. …

> …

> To aid the courts in making an appropriate award of damages for loss of amenities, evidence should be taken from friends or relatives of the plaintiff comparing his pre- and post-accident situation in respect of his _hobbies and leisure activities_, as well as any significant personality changes (including memory lapses, inability to concentrate, temper, and depression).

> \[emphasis added\]

62     The plaintiff contends that he should be granted a separate award for loss of amenities as he is, because of the chronic right shoulder pain, unable to: (a) drive for an extended period; (b) perform overhead activities; and (c) sleep on his right side.[^56] There is no evidence before me that the first two of these activities were formerly the plaintiff’s leisure activities. To the contrary, in respect of the latter, Prof Kumar categorically stated that the plaintiff had “never engaged in sports prior to the last injury”[^57] – this information must presumably have been based on his history-taking from the plaintiff. There is also no evidence as to whether and to what extent the plaintiff’s inability to sleep on his right side has affected his quality of life. In short, the evidence adduced by the plaintiff on this head of claim is a far cry from the type of evidence considered in past cases where an award for loss of amenities has been made. For instance, in _Mykytowych, Pamela Jane v V I P Hotel_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 829</span> (“_Pamela Jane_”), where the evidence showed that the appellant was an active participant in motorsports activities before her accident, the Court of Appeal recognised that there was sufficient basis to award the appellant loss of amenities (at \[101\]):

> …\[T\]here is, in our view, a case for awarding the Appellant damages for loss of amenities because she was an avid motor car racer prior to the Accident. … \[T\]he Appellant is the only woman to have completed the 15,000km car rally from Peking to Paris… The evidence also shows that right up to the point of the Accident, the Appellant had consistently renewed her membership of various motor car racing clubs, and she was, at the time of the Accident, inquiring about an upcoming motorsports competition. It does not appear that the Appellant has participated in any motorsports competitions or renewed her membership of motor car racing clubs since the Accident. It is probably the case that she can no longer participate in such competitions as she might not pass the requisite medical tests and assessments in the light of her CRPS.

63     All things considered, in using the Guidelines as a reference point (the Guidelines consider the extent of residual disabilities as one of the factors in categorising the respective injuries), I have already considered some of the plaintiff’s disabilities into account in awarding the general damages for the right shoulder injury (see \[51(f)\] above). In the circumstances, there is manifestly no basis for a further _distinct_ award for loss of amenities to be made in this case.

### Future medical expenses

64     I turn now to the claim for future medical expenses. Here, the plaintiff claims for the costs of future total joint replacement surgery of his right shoulder. This surgery was recommended by Prof Kumar in his specialist medical report dated 18 July 2016 wherein he noted that if the plaintiff’s pain worsens, this surgery “may be indicated”.[^58] Based on this, the plaintiff claims for a sum of $28,031.33 as future medical expenses.[^59] The said sum is the estimated costs of a total right shoulder joint replacement surgery in an “A1” ward at the National University Hospital (“NUH”).[^60] The estimated costs for the same surgery in a “B1” ward at NUH is instead $20,688.45.[^61]

65     In the alternative to his argument on causation (which has been partially rejected as above at \[49\]), the defendant contends that the medical evidence and the passage of time since the recommendation of the surgery by Prof Kumar suggest that the plaintiff does not reasonably require any future surgery to his right shoulder.[^62]

66     The defendant’s argument appears to be ill-conceived because future medical costs should be awarded as long as there is an _appreciable_ risk that the claimant will suffer that loss and the eventual quantum awarded should as far as possible, among other things, reflect the _probability_ of the eventuality of this risk (see _Lua Bee Kiang (administrator of the estate of Chew Kong Seng, deceased) v Yeo Chee Siong_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 SLR 145</span> (“_Lua Bee Kiang_”) at \[72\]):

> … In our judgment, in assessing damages for future loss – such as cost of nursing care – arising from the possible future onset of a medical condition as a result of the defendant’s negligence, the court must first determine whether there is an _appreciable risk_ that the claimant will suffer that loss. If there is such a risk of future loss, then the claimant ought to be compensated for it. The court’s task will be to evaluate that risk. The court may take as its starting point an award corresponding to the full extent of that loss, and then adjust it to account for the remoteness of the possibility and the chance that factors unconnected with the defendant’s negligence might contribute to bringing about the loss. In making this adjustment, however, the court should not be fixated on discerning a precise percentage by which the award should be discounted, because the exercise is inherently imprecise. To this extent, we agree with the minority’s view in _Malec_. Instead, the appropriate discount ought to be decided bearing in mind the principle stated by Lord Morris in _Mallett_, namely, that the opposing probabilities must be weighed with sympathy and with fairness for the interests of all concerned and at all times with a sense of proportion. Such an approach would be consonant with the central principle of fair compensation which underlies this area of the law. \[emphasis in original\]

67     Based on my assessment of the medical evidence, I agree with the plaintiff[^63] that there is an appreciable risk that the plaintiff may require such a surgery in the future for two main reasons. First, Prof Kumar’s opinion that the plaintiff may need a total joint replacement surgery in the future if his pain worsens[^64] has not been challenged by the defendant – the cross-examination of Prof Kumar was exclusively concerned with the issue of causation.

68     Second, the defendant’s own expert, Dr Chang, gave evidence that the need for a total joint replacement surgery is _possible_, albeit highly unlikely, for the plaintiff in the future given the permanent incapacitation in his right shoulder:[^65]

> Q:    You do agree that the injury to the right shoulder is permanent?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    The plaintiff is permanently incapacitated?

> A:    Yes, as far as his right shoulder is concerned.

> …

> Q:    When you examined him 5 years later, he was still complaining of pain to his right shoulder?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    Would you agree that if the pain continues to subsist, he would require a total joint replacement?

> A:     _It is possible but unlikely at this point_. There are other things that we can do before we go for surgery. Based on the X-rays, these are soft tissue injuries and the joints are still intact. So we can do tendon grafting or repair to improve function of shoulder. We only do joint replacement if the joints are affected.

> Q:    But if these other options are not available, then surgery is required?

> A:    Yes.

> …

> Q:    I put it to you that the plaintiff would require total joint replacement surgery in the future for his right shoulder pain?

> A:     _I agree partially_.

> …

> Q:    For the need for total joint replacement surgery, you partially agreed. Why?

> A:    The injury is essentially soft tissue injury. If you still got pain, it is still possible that the tear may not have healed properly. So there are other procedures like repair or tendon grafting. We only do joint replacement surgery when the joints are arthritic. _A surgery is not impossible but highly unlikely in this case._

> \[emphasis added\]

69     I accordingly find that there is an appreciable risk that the plaintiff may require a total joint replacement surgery in the future. However, given the plaintiff’s evidence that his pain has not reached a point where this surgery is required (this evidence was given more than _three_ years after the surgery was recommended by Prof Kumar),[^66] and Dr Chang’s assessment of the surgery as a last resort in the preceding paragraph, I assess the probability of this risk as a very low one. Further, as noted by the Court of Appeal in _Lua Bee Kiang_ (see \[66\] above), I must also consider the factors unconnected with the defendant’s negligence that might contribute to bringing about the loss. In this regard, based on my finding that only one out of the three tears is attributable to the defendant’s negligence, a further downward adjustment is warranted. Acknowledging the inherent difficulties in arriving at the appropriate discount for future medical expenses in such cases and considering the matter holistically with “sympathy and a sense of proportion” (_Lua Bee Kiang_ at \[80\]), I find that a discount of 70% is appropriate here.

70     Further, the full compensation benchmark for _reasonable_ future treatment should at best be the costs of treatment at a “B1” ward as opposed to an “A1” ward – the plaintiff has not shown any special circumstances to justify why the treatment provided at a “B1” ward would be unsuitable for him. In fact, it appears from a consideration of his previous bill with NUH for the debridement surgery that he did not stay at an “A1” ward during the surgery.[^67] It is also telling that the costs of the surgery suggested to Dr Chang during cross-examination by plaintiff’s counsel was based on the costs at a “B1” ward (see \[64\] above):[^68]

> Q:    1ABD95, costs of total joint replacement surgery indicated by NUH at $20,000 is reasonable?

> A:    Yes.

71     Applying the 70% discount to the estimated costs of future treatment at a “B1” ward at NUH. I accordingly award the plaintiff the sum of **$6,206.54** for future medical expenses.

### Loss of future earnings (LFE)/Loss of earning capacity (LEC)

72     I turn now to the final head of general damages for LFE and LEC.

#### LFE

73     The plaintiff claims for the sum of $204,793.20 for LFE based on the following:[^69]

> (a)     At the time of the Accident and since 9 March 2015, the plaintiff was employed as a Security Operations Manager with Security Enforcer Pte Ltd (“Security Enforcer”), with the salary of $3,300 per month.

> (b)     Due to his permanent right shoulder pain, the plaintiff resigned from his job at Security Enforcer on 13 May 2019 and took on the role of a part-time security officer with Security & Risk Solutions Pte Ltd with a salary of $2,880.

> (c)     Thereafter (the exact date is unclear from the plaintiff’s submissions), the plaintiff left his job as a part-time security officer and is now currently unemployed.

> (d)     The plaintiff is now only able to do clerical work. Based on the FY2021 Salary Guidelines for Social Services Sector from the National Council of Social Services, the average wage of a junior clerical officer is $1,670 per month – the plaintiff is therefore likely to suffer a loss of $1,630 every month when compared to his pre-accident income with Security Enforcer.

74     The general principle for granting loss of future earnings is summarised in the Court of Appeal’s decision in _Teo Sing Keng and another v Sim Ban Kiat_ <span class="citation">\[1994\] 1 SLR(R) 340</span> (at \[38\], citing the dictum in _Ong Ah Long v Dr S Underwood_ <span class="citation">\[1983\] 2 MLJ 324</span> at 333):

> …\[A\]n injured plaintiff is entitled to damages for the loss of earnings and profits which he has suffered by reason of his injuries up to the date of the trial and for the loss of the prospective earnings and profits of which he is likely to be deprived in the future. _There must be evidence on which the court can find that the plaintiff will suffer future loss of earnings_, it cannot act on mere speculation. …. \[emphasis added\]

75     In a similar vein, the Court of Appeal held as follows in _Chai Kang Wei Samuel v Shaw Linda Gillian_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 3 SLR 587</span> (“_Linda Shaw_”) (at \[19\]):

> …\[A\] plaintiff has the burden of proving his or her claim in damages… \[L\]oss of future earnings must be ‘_real assessable loss_ proved by evidence’… Therefore, if a plaintiff should fail to provide _sufficient evidence_ of loss of future earnings, his or her claim for loss of future earnings cannot succeed. \[emphasis added\]

76     The above authorities make clear that _sufficient_ evidence of “real assessable loss” is required to succeed in a claim for loss of future earnings. In my judgment, the plaintiff is unable to discharge this burden. What is most fatal to the plaintiff’s claim for LFE here is his failure to file any supplementary affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) to aver that he had since resigned from his job with Security Enforcer. The plaintiff attempts to highlight that this fact is confirmed by Dr Chang in his specialist medical report.[^70] However, a careful reading of Dr Chang’s report[^71] in its context would reveal that his reference to the plaintiff being currently unemployed is nothing more than just hearsay evidence. While the fact that the plaintiff is currently unemployed may very well be true, the law operates only on the basis of _admissible_ evidence.

77     Indeed, the above should not come as any surprise to the plaintiff’s counsel. During the first day of the AD Hearing, the plaintiff’s counsel attempted to introduce evidence of the plaintiff’s new employment as a part-time security officer by way of a supplementary bundle of documents. The defendant unsurprisingly objected. I then ordered that if the plaintiff wished to rely on this evidence, he should file an application for leave to file a supplementary AEIC. While the plaintiff did initially take up such an application, he subsequently withdrew the application.

78     The result is that the _only_ admissible evidence that I am left with concerning the plaintiff’s employment history is that he had worked for Security Enforcer from March 2015.[^72] In a similar vein, the plaintiff’s claim that he is currently unemployed is also unsubstantiated. Indeed, even the plaintiff’s counsel appear to be unsure of when the plaintiff had resigned from his job as a part-time security officer – two different references to the years of 2019 and 2020 without any accompanying month is stated in the closing submissions.[^73] It is therefore unsurprising that the plaintiff has adopted the same multiplicand of $1,630 per month from the date of the plaintiff’s resignation with Security Enforcer,[^74] despite his own case that his loss of income was only $420 per month when he changed his job to become a part-time security officer.[^75]

79     The plaintiff also did not call any representatives from Security Enforcer to explain why he had allegedly resigned from his job on 13 May 2019. Such evidence would have been especially critical in this case since the plaintiff continued to work with Security Enforcer after his last medical leave expired on 5 June 2016. Despite the various difficulties the plaintiff had expressed he faced in his job with Security Enforcer,[^76] the plaintiff confirmed during cross-examination that he was still employed with Security Enforcer at the time of affirmation on his AEIC on 1 March 2019.[^77] Based on the case mounted by the plaintiff, given that he was able to work in his pre-accident vocation for close to four years after the Accident, it behoves the plaintiff to have called representatives from Security Enforcer to corroborate his claim that he was unable to continue working in his pre-accident vocation. Finally, there is also no evidence of any income tax documents to show the plaintiff’s complete income history both before and after the Accident.

80     For the foregoing reasons, I find that there is wholly a lack of evidence, let alone sufficient evidence that the plaintiff is likely to suffer any loss in earnings in the future.

#### LEC

81     Alternatively, the plaintiff claims for LEC for the same sum of $204,793.20 based on the _Actuarial Tables with Explanatory Notes for use in Personal Injury and Death Claims_ (Academy Publishing of the Singapore Academy of Law, 2021) (“Actuarial Tables”).[^78]

82     To begin with, in adopting the same methodology and submitting for the same quantum for both LFE and LEC, the plaintiff appears to have conflated the two distinct heads of losses in the form of LFE and LEC. As the Court of Appeal noted in _Linda Shaw_ at \[20\]:

> … These two heads of damages are meant to compensate for _different_ losses – \[LFE\] compensates for the difference between the post-accident and pre-accident income or rate of income, while \[LEC\] compensates for the risk or disadvantage, which the plaintiff would suffer in the event that he or she should lose the job that he or she currently holds, in securing an equivalent job in the open employment market. \[emphasis added\]

83     Be that as it may, insofar as the Actuarial Tables can be said to be relevant to a claim for LEC in assessing the relevant multiplier (see _Quek Yen Fei Kenneth v Yeo Chye Huat and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 229</span> (“_Kenneth Quek_”) at \[92\]), there is a preliminary question of whether the Actuarial Tables should be applied in the present proceedings.

84     The State Courts Practice Direction at para 145 provides that the Actuarial Tables would be used in “all proceedings for the assessment of damages in personal injury and death claims that are heard on or after _1 April 2021_” \[emphasis added\]. The preliminary question arises since the AD Hearing commenced earlier on 29 May 2019.

85     The plaintiff submits that the Actuarial Tables apply in the present case as the last tranche of the AD Hearing (_ie_, 15 June 2021) was concluded after the relevant commencement date.[^79] The defendant however contends that the present proceedings fall on the wrong side of the commencement date for the applicability of the Actuarial Tables and that it would be “manifestly prejudicial” to the defendant given that the Actuarial Tables were not in force at the time the plaintiff was cross-examined.[^80]

86     On the first issue of the applicability of the Actuarial Tables, in the absence of further detailed submissions, I find that it is unnecessary for me to conclusively decide this issue in the present case. This is because, even if the Actuarial Tables are applicable, paragraph 145(2) of the State Courts Practice Directions provides that: “\[w\]here appropriate on the facts and circumstances of the case, the Court may depart from the multipliers in the Actuarial Tables”.

87     I find that this is an appropriate case to depart from the applicability of the Actuarial Tables (if they are applicable to begin with) given that by 1 April 2021, the AD Hearing was almost complete with only the last tranche left for Dr Chang’s cross-examination on 15 June 2021. If the plaintiff’s counsel intended to rely on the Actuarial Tables, in the circumstances of this case where the evidential phase of the AD Hearing was close to completion, they should have given _advance notice_ to the defendant rather than simply relying on the Actuarial Tables in the closing submissions. If such notice had been provided, the defendant may have elected to recall the plaintiff for further cross-examination or adduce other evidence to show why the Actuarial Tables should not be applied in the specific circumstances of this case.

88     Indeed, a similar view was expressed recently by Justice S Mohan in _Muhammad Adam bin Mohammad Lee (suing by his litigation representatives Noraini bte Tabiin and Nurul Ashikin binte Muhammad Lee) v Tay Jia Rong Sean_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 264</span> at \[147\] (for present purposes, para 159 of the Supreme Court Practice Directions are _in pari materia_ with para 145 of the State Court Practice Directions). In this case, the facts were slightly different in that the evidential hearing had concluded before 1 April 2021 but closing submissions were tendered after the commencement date. In particular, Justice Mohan noted as follows:

> 148    I am cognisant of the fact that the \[Actuarial\] Tables were only published in March 2021 such that the plaintiff could not possibly have given advance notice to the defendant of his reliance on them in the closing submissions. However, the proper course of action to take, if at all, in such a situation would be to seek leave from the court to reopen the evidentiary proceedings so as to introduce the point (and the revised formulation of damages) formally and properly, and not to simply raise the \[Actuarial\] Tables in closing submissions. This is especially since the multipliers derived from the \[Actuarial\] Tables will almost invariably result in a significant enhancement to the quantum of future losses claimable by a victim who has suffered personal injuries as a result of a tort. …

89     In the further alternative, the plaintiff submits for an LEC of $70,000 based on the precedent approach.[^81]

90     The Court of Appeal held in _Linda Shaw_ that an award for LEC is made where: (a) there is a substantial or real risk that the plaintiff could lose his job at some time before the estimated end of his working life; and (b) evidence that he will, because of the injuries, be at a risk or disadvantage in securing an equivalent job in the open employment market (at \[20\] and \[36\]).

91     The defendant submits that no award should be made for LEC as there is no evidence of any difficulties encountered by the plaintiff in finding an alternative job – the fact that the defendant was able to secure a job as a security officer after his resignation from Security Enforcer suggests that he has little to no difficulty securing employment in the open labour market.[^82]

92     First and foremost, as noted above at \[78\], I am precluded from considering any evidence concerning the plaintiff’s subsequent employment history given the plaintiff’s failure to properly admit such evidence. Further and in any event, the defendant appears to have misconstrued the relevant legal principles. The legal test is different if the plaintiff had changed his pre-accident employment by the time of assessment. I had the opportunity to clarify the applicable test in such a scenario in _Pawel Gajewski v Lee Tong Lynn_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 153</span> where I concluded that “the sole requirement that has to be met is whether the plaintiff ‘has been prevented from competing in the market for his _pre-accident job’”_ \[emphasis in original\] (at \[46\], citing _Lua Bee Kiang_ at \[50\]; see also the decision of DJ Thian Yee Sze in _Muhammad Saifuddin Bin Hannabi v Kok Chee Keong_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 212</span> at \[50\] where this principle was applied).

93     In my judgment, based on the available evidence before me, I am convinced that the plaintiff has shown that there is an appreciable risk that he may be unable to compete in the market for his pre-accident job as an Operations Manager in the security industry for the following reasons:

> (a)     Both Dr Chang[^83] and Prof Kumar[^84] agree that the plaintiff is likely to suffer from permanent incapacity in his right shoulder. Dr Chang even suggested that the plaintiff would face difficulties in driving for long hours and is likely to only be able to perform jobs that are _clerical_ in nature due to his right shoulder disability.[^85]

> (b)     From my perusal of the plaintiff’s scope of work in his employment contract with Security Enforcer,[^86] I am convinced that his right shoulder disability is likely to prevent him from carrying out some of the duties expected of him as an Operations Manager such as running errands for his company, as well as conducting meetings, investigations, and spot-checks.

94     In assessing the quantum for LEC, the court considers all relevant factors such as “the plaintiff’s age, his skills, the nature of his disability, whether he is capable of undertaking only one type of work or whether he is capable of undertaking other types of work as well.” (_Pamela Jane_ at \[141\]). It is also relevant to consider the plaintiff’s salary in his pre-accident vocation and assess his re-employability based on his skills and qualifications (see _Lee Mui Yeng v Ng Tong Yoo_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 46</span> (“_Lee Mui Yeng_”) at \[103\]). Finally, the court also typically refers to past precedents to “ensure that the amounts assessed are broadly consistent and in line with previous awards made for similarly-situated plaintiffs” (see _P_r_actitioners’ Library_ at para 4-27).

95     Here, the plaintiff was 60 years old at the time of assessment and is presently 61 years old. Based on the authority of _Lua Bee Kiang_ (at \[53\]), I agree with the plaintiff that it would be reasonable to adopt 70 years as the expected work life expectancy for the plaintiff.[^87] It follows that the appropriate multiplier here is 5 years, applying a discount of about 50% (see _Kenneth Quek_ at \[98\]).

96     For the multiplicand, in the absence of tangible evidence before the court, I am prepared to adopt a figure of $750. In doing so, I have taken note that the plaintiff has had about 23 years of experience in the security industry[^88] and was commanding a pre-accident income of $3,300. I have also considered the wide range of duties and responsibilities that the defendant wielded with Security Enforcer for at least four years, which included duties such as conducting meetings and interviews as well as training and managing security personnel.[^89] Given the plaintiff’s ability to deal with such administrative and managerial duties, it is likely that he would be able to earn a much higher salary than a junior clerical officer (see the plaintiff’s contention at \[73(d)\] above). Further, to take into account my finding that only one out of the three tears is attributable to the defendant’s negligence, I find that a further 1/3 discount is warranted (see _Lua Bee Kiang_ at \[72\], reproduced at \[66\] above). This would give an overall figure of **$15,000** for the LEC \[($750 x 5 x 12)/3\].

97     Even without factoring the need for discount into account, the sum I award as LEC in this case is comparable with the following precedents:

> (a)     In _Pamela Jane_, the Court of Appeal granted an appellant, who was 50 years old at the time of assessment, $25,000 for LEC. In _Pamela Jane_, there was evidence that the appellant was able to command a salary of $5,130 as a lecturer after the accident but the Court of Appeal nonetheless recognised that the appellant “may not be able to work at the same intensity or level as before due to the bouts of pain and discomfort that she may suffer as a result of her CRPS” (at \[135\] and \[142\]). Here, the plaintiff is significantly older and has a much lower pre-accident income than the appellant in _Pamela Jane_ (at \[133\]).

> (b)     Second, in _Lee Mui Yeng_, Kannan Ramesh JC (as his Honour then was) awarded LEC of $2,000 to a plaintiff who was 60 years old at the time of assessment and was earning an average of $1,965 per month after the accident. Like the present case, the plaintiff in _Lee Mui Yeng_ was noted to have adduced little evidence of her present salary and the risk of job loss but the court nonetheless recognised that there was a risk (at \[103\]). Here, the plaintiff is likely to command a similar salary[^90] as the plaintiff in _Lee Mui Yeng_ if the risk of job loss materialises. But since the plaintiff’s pre-accident income is higher (see _Lee Mui Yeng_ at \[14\] and \[103\]) and he may be unlikely to command such an income again in the future, a higher sum for LEC is appropriate in this case.

## Special damages

### Pre-trial loss of earnings

98     Both parties agree that the plaintiff should be awarded pre-trial loss of earnings for the sum of $550. This sum represents the plaintiff’s loss of salary for five days when he was on unpaid hospitalisation leave from 1 June 2016 to 5 June 2016. I accordingly award the plaintiff the sum of **$550** as claimed.

99     In addition, the plaintiff now claims for a further sum of $40,750 for pre-trial loss of earnings for a period of 25 months from 13 May 2019 to the final date of AD Hearing on 15 June 2021, with a multiplicand of $1,630.[^91] As pointed out at \[78\] above, there is no basis to adopt the uniform multiplicand of $1,630 per month – based on the plaintiff’s own case, he only suffered a loss of $420 per month when he resigned from Security Enforcer to become a security officer. If any, the suggested loss of $1,630 per month can only be considered from the time he allegedly left his role as a security officer. However, as I have emphasised, all parties are none the wiser as to when this happened.

100    In any event, the defendant contends that further pre-trial loss of earnings should not be awarded as such a claim has not been pleaded in the Statement of Claim, resulting in a lack of fair notice to the defendant.[^92] I agree. Indeed, as noted by Ramesh JC in _Lee Mui Yeng_ at \[66\]:

> …\[I\]n an action for personal injuries, a plaintiff is required to plead expenses or loss of earnings that he or she has already incurred where these can be quantified with near exactitude. The principle is in place to give the defendant _an opportunity to prepare his case as well as to consider settlement possibilities_. The failure to plead special damages will in the ordinary case disentitle the plaintiff to claim such damages from the defendant unless no prejudice has ensued (see _Ng Bee Lian v Fernandez and another_ <span class="citation">\[1994\] 2 SLR(R) 179</span> at \[30\]). \[emphasis in original\]

101    Further, in the context of a personal injuries claim, O 18 r 12(1A) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“the ROC”) provides that a plaintiff has to serve a statement of the special damages claimed (“Statement of Special Damages”) together with the statement of claim. The ROC goes on to define the Statement of Special Damages at O 18 r 12(1C) as follows:

> ...\[A\] statement giving _full_ particulars of the special damages claimed for expenses and losses already incurred and an _estimate_ of any _future_ expenses and _losses_ (including _loss of earnings_, loss of Central Provident Fund contributions and loss of pension rights). \[emphasis added\]

102    However, the Statement of Special Damages included by the plaintiff in his Statement of Claim did not include any reference to any claim of pre-trial loss of earnings other than the sum of $550. Neither was this claim expressed to be a continuing one.

103    If it was indeed true that that the plaintiff’s employment history had changed after the filing of the Statement of Special Damages, the plaintiff ought to have sought leave to amend the Statement of Special Damages and file a supplementary AEIC to provide the requisite notice to the defendant. His failure to do so is puzzling. As referenced above at \[77\] in the context of my analysis on the LFE claim, the plaintiff was specifically alerted to the need to properly adduce the evidence of his current employment history during the first tranche of the AD Hearing. However, for reasons best known to the plaintiff, he declined to file any supplementary AEIC to aver to the change in his occupation and attest to the consequent further pre-trial loss of earnings that he now claims. The Statement of Special Damages was also not amended. In the circumstances, the defendant rightly did not pursue any line of questioning during the AD Hearing in relation to pre-trial loss of earnings suffered by the plaintiff from 13 May 2019. It follows that there is simply no basis to award the plaintiff any further pre-trial loss of earnings.

### Medical expenses

104    For medical expenses, the plaintiff claims for a total sum of $8,234.35.[^93] The defendant, on the other hand, submits for a sum of $805.10.[^94] The only dispute between the parties’ submissions for medical expenses turns on whether the medical expenses incurred in connection with the right shoulder injury for the sum of $7,429.25 should be awarded to the plaintiff.

105    Here, it follows from my finding that since I have generally found in favour of the plaintiff on the issue of causation, the medical expenses incurred in respect of the right shoulder injury should be awarded to the plaintiff. As the claim in medical expenses is supported by the documentary evidence[^95] and there is no other dispute that the defendant raises,[^96] I accordingly award the medical expenses as claimed for the full sum of **$8,234.35**.

106    For completeness, even though this point has not been pursued by the defendant, I should state that I do not think that there is any benefit in discounting the medical expenses because of my finding that only one out of the three tears is attributable to the defendant’s negligence. This is because it is unlikely and there is also no evidence that the medical expenses incurred by the plaintiff would have been significantly lesser if there was only one tear instead of three.

### Transport expenses

107    For transport expenses, the plaintiff claims for a sum of $500 based on a total of 26 round taxi trips made to TTSH and NUH.[^97] While the defendant initially submitted instead for a sum of $300 in the JOS, the defendant has now stated that he is agreeable to the sum claimed by the plaintiff given the “_de minimis_ difference” in parties’ position.[^98]

108    Based on the authority of the High Court decision in _Tan Hun Boon v Rui Feng Travel Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 244</span> at \[147\], I allow the plaintiff’s claim for transport expenses even in the absence of any receipts retained by him. Given the undisputed evidence of the plaintiff’s 26 round trips for medical treatment following the Accident, I have no hesitation to award him the full claimed sum of **$500**.

## Conclusion

109    For the above reasons, I assess the damages in the case as follows (total: $52,990.89) at 100% liability:

> (a)     general damages (total: $43,706.54):

>> (i)       pain and suffering for neck injury: $6,000;

>> (ii)       pain and suffering for left shoulder injury: $2,500;

>> (iii)       pain and suffering for right shoulder injury: $12,000;

>> (iv)       pain and suffering for minor surgical scars: $2,000;

>> (v)       loss of amenities: nil;

>> (vi)       future medical expenses: $6,206.54;

>> (vii)       LFE: nil; and

>> (viii)       LEC: $15,000.

> (b)     special damages (total: $9,284.35):

>> (i)       pre-trial loss of earnings for unpaid hospitalisation leave from 1 June 2016 to 5 June 2016: $550 (agreed);

>> (ii)       additional pre-trial loss of earnings from 13 May 2019 to 15 June 2021: nil;

>> (iii)       medical expenses: $8,234.35; and

>> (iv)       transport expenses: $500.

110    At 95% liability, the total award would accordingly be **$50,341.35**. I will hear parties on costs and interest at the appropriate juncture.

111    In closing, I find myself compelled to observe that the plaintiff’s closing submissions tendered in this case were poorly organised and unnecessarily long – spanning in excess of 130 pages. Further, in addition to the points made in my introductory overview regarding consistency in claims between the JOS and the closing submissions, the same quantum for future medical expenses were claimed by the plaintiff with the same basis as part of _both_ general and special damages. There were even repeated references to substantially similar lengthy excerpts of the notes of evidence in consecutive sub-paragraphs.[^99] Submissions of such nature generally provide limited assistance to the court and may detract from the main points raised.
