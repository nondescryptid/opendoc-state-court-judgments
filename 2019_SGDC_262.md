\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9300/2019/01.\]

4 December 2019

### District Judge Toh Han Li:

1       This is an appeal by the accused against sentence.

## The charge

2       The accused pleaded guilty to the following charge:

> _DSC-900087-2019_

> You are charged that you, on or around 28 July 2015, in Singapore, did abet by engaging in a conspiracy with Jimmy Ng Kian Bin (“Jimmy”) and Erik Ng Song Hann to furnish a false statement to the Singapore Exchange Derivatives Trading Limited (“SGX-DT”), a futures exchange, relating to Jimmy’s trading in futures contracts, namely the SGX MSCI Singapore Index July 2015 Futures (“SGN15”) and in pursuance of the conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing, an act took place to wit you submitted a statement to the SGX-DT through UOB Bullion & Futures Ltd on 28 July 2015 claiming that:

>> (a)    Jimmy was doing a beta of his “algo strategy”, when he did not conduct any algorithm trading on 24 July 2015 from 0900 hrs to 0930 hrs and from 1330 hrs to 1530 hrs; and

>> (b)    Jimmy placed numerous buying and selling orders simultaneously in the futures market for SGN15 intending for the orders to be filled continuously as long there is open interest in the market, when he had no intention for the buying and selling orders to be filled continuously,

> which statement was furnished with the intent to deceive the SGX-DT about Jimmy’s trading activities on SGN15 after the SGX-DT queried Jimmy and you have thereby committed an offence under section 330(1)(a) of the Securities and Futures Act (Chapter 289, 2006 Revised Edition) (“s 330 SFA offence”) read with section 109 of the Penal Code Chapter 224.

## Statement of Facts

3       The accused is Joseph Chai Ming Leong. At the material time, he was the director of Joerik Financial Pte Ltd (“Joerik”), a SGX-DT proprietary trading member. The accused also ran and co-owned Joerik with another director, Erik Ng Song Hann (“Erik”). The accused and Erik each owned 50% of Joerik.

4       On 17 December 2015, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”) received information from the Singapore Exchange Derivatives Trading Limited (“SGX-DT”) about suspected trading irregularities in Joerik trading account TB108 (“TB108”) on SGX MSCI Singapore Index Futures July 2015 contract (“SGN 15”).

5       On 27 July 2015 at 1714 hours, SGX-DT sent an email query to Joerik’s broker, UOB Bullion and Futures Limited (“UOBBF”) to enquire about trading irregularities it observed in account TB108 in SGN15 on 24 July 2015 from 0900 hours to 0930 hours and from 1330 hours to 1530 hours (hereinafter known as the “material time”). In particular, SGX-DT asked about:

> a.     the purpose of Joerik performing high frequency order entries and withdrawals at prevailing market bid/ask; and

> b.     the identity of the trader who made the orders.

6       UOBBF notified Joerik about the query from SGX-DT and sought its reply. Joerik replied that TB108 was operated by Jimmy Ng Kian Bin (“Jimmy”), a trader who worked for Joerik and reported to both the accused and Erik.

7       On the same day at 1740 hours, UOBBF emailed the directors of Joerik, namely the accused and Erik, to seek their response to the said query. The accused, Jimmy and Erik discussed their reply to SGX-DT over a WhatsApp group chat.

8       At the material time, Jimmy had engaged in what is known as spoofing on SGN15. Briefly, Jimmy tried to give a false impression of either demand or supply on one side of the order book of SGN15 by placing a large number of orders on either the buy side (at or below the prevailing best bid prices) or the ask side (at or above the prevailing best ask prices) without the intention to execute the order(s). At the same time he entered the spoof orders, he would place genuine orders to trade on the other side of the order book. The objective of Jimmy’s spoofing trading conduct was to obtain superior bid prices or ask prices than he could otherwise obtain.

9       Investigations reveal that the accused had already known at the material time on 24 July 2015 of Jimmy’s illegal trading activity on SGD15, even before SGX-DT initiated the query on 27 July 2015. On 24 July 2015, the accused and Erik exchanged messages where they discussed the success of Jimmy’s spoofing strategy. The accused was only concerned that Jimmy’s spoofing strategy was risky, and not that his strategy was illegal.

10     The accused, Erik and Jimmy then discussed how to reply SGX-DT to help cover up for Jimmy. The following statement was issued to SGX-DT claiming that:

> a.     Jimmy was “doing a beta of \[his\] algo strategy” when Jimmy did not conduct any algorithm trading at the material time; and

> b.     that Jimmy “placed numerous buying and selling orders simultaneously in the futures market for SGN15 intending for the orders to be filled continuously (as long there is open interest in the market)”, when Jimmy had no intention for the buying and selling orders to be filled continuously.

11     The accused knew the statement in paragraph 9 to be untrue. It was the accused who conceived and drafted the reply, which Jimmy and Erik agreed to.

12     On 28 July 2015, the accused sent the reply containing the false statement to SGX-DT through UOBBF, copying Erik. The accused admitted that he knowingly helped Jimmy to explain away Jimmy’s illegal trading activity to avoid further trouble with SGX-DT.

## Charge taken into consideration for sentencing (“TIC charge”)

13     The accused admitted to the following charge to be take into consideration for the purposes of sentencing:

> You…are charged that you, on or around 1 September 2016, in Singapore, did abet by engaging in a conspiracy with Erik Ng Song Hann (“Erik”) to furnish a false statement to the Singapore Exchange Derivatives Trading Limited (“SGX-DT”), a futures exchange, relating to Erik’s trading in futures contracts, namely the SGX MSCI Taiwan Index August 2016 Futures (“TWQ16”), and in pursuance of the conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing, an act took place to wit Erik, with your knowledge, submitted a statement to the SGX-DT through UOB Bullion & Futures Ltd on 1 September 2016 claiming that he was doing arbitrage trading on the Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index futures (“TAIEX”) and mini-TAIEX futures, when it was not true that he was doing arbitrage trading, and which statement was furnished with the intent to deceive the SGX-DT about Erik’s trading activities on TWQ16 after a query from the SGX-DT and you have thereby committed an offence under section 330(1)(a) of the Securities and Futures Act (Chapter 289, 2006 Revised Edition) read with section 109 of the Penal Code Chapter 224.

## Antecedents

14     The accused is a first offender.

## Prosecutions submission on sentence

15     Prosecution’s submitted that the accused should receive 4 weeks’ imprisonment for the proceeded charge, as his accomplices, Jimmy and Erik, had each received the same sentence for their role in the proceeded charge.

16     The prosecution submitted that the accused did not play a minor role in issuing the false statement. He actively drafted the false statement and reminded Jimmy to “read through and see if its justifiable” because if he is invited “for a coffee session at SGX, must be able to stand with this claim \[SIC\]”.

17     By issuing the false statement to SGX-DT, Jimmy was able to temporarily conceal his fraudulent market conduct from SGX. This was done with the help and the knowledge of the accused. The accused was clearly helping Jimmy out of self-interest because Jimmy was trading on behalf of Joerik, and if Jimmy was punished, Joerik would likely be punished too.

18     The prosecution submitted that the accused’s role in the present offence was no less than the role played by Jimmy and Erik. The culpability is the same and therefore the sentence meted should be the same.

19     Further, the prosecution submitted that with respect to the TIC charge, the accused had committed a similar offence on 1 September 2016 he conspired with Erik to furnish a false statement to SGX-DT relating to Erik’s trading activities on another futures contract. Through the false statement, he assisted Erik in concealing his fraudulent trading activities from the SGX-DT.

## Mitigation

20     The defence highlighted the following salient background facts:

21     The accused is married with four children aged 1, 8, 11 and 13. His father passed away recently in May 2019 and he was still grieving over his father’s passing. In 2003 the accused got to know Erik when they were attending at trading course at the SGX to attain the relevant certification to become a trader. After successfully completing the course, they rented a booth together to trade electronically. In 2005 they approached UOB who offered them two trading desks and they started trading at UOB in 2006. In 2006, they incorporated their own trading companies but remained close friends and supported each other financially and the defence gave examples of how they supported each other financially. In 2012, the accused and Erik decided to merge their companies to form Joerik.

22     In 2013, they invested in a more efficient trading system and in order to lower their costs by benefitting from economies of scale, decided to engage more traders to join Joerik. One of these traders recruited was Jimmy. The accused saw his younger self in Jimmy and wanted to groom him, treating him like a younger brother and guiding him.

23     In asking the court to impose a high fine for the s 330 SFA offence, defence counsel highlighted the following circumstances surrounding the offence:

24     The accused had pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity which is testament to his genuine remorse, contriteness for his actions, thus saving the courts valuable time and resources while also facilitated the administration of justice. He had cooperated with the authorities and voluntarily supplied all relevant information pertaining to the investigations.

25     The accused was not involved in the spoofing conduct of Jimmy. He felt that he needed to help Jimmy think of a reason to avoid Jimmy being reprimanded by SGX for the spoofing conduct. He felt that it was his responsibility as the “older brother” to take care of Jimmy’s problems. His intention was to discipline Jimmy rather than have him reprimanded by the SGX.

26     The accused stood nothing to gain from the entire episode. He has since stepped down as a Director of Joerik.

27     While Jimmy’s act of spoofing the market would potentially have affected the market, this would have already been caused regardless of the accused ‘s attempted explanation of Jimmy’s conduct.

28     Jimmy’s conduct of spoofing the market was commonplace in 2015 and the accused did not think that Jimmy’s actions would have led to such grave consequences. Further, the detailed guidelines against “spoofing” were only released in the SGX Trade Surveillance Hand Book on 29 September 2016.

29     After finding out about Jimmy’s manner of trading in July 2015 he warned Jimmy against repeating his behaviour. When Jimmy persisted subsequently, he wrote in May 2007, asked UOB to suspend Jimmy’s trading account. He had also approached UOB compliance officer for advice on how to enhance Joerik’s compliance capabilities and eventually installed the relevant software to do so.

30     Defence counsel cited example of cases under other acts (s 28 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, s 182 of the Penal Code and s 402 of the Companies Act) where fines had been imposed in some cases for the furnishing of false information to authorities.

31     With respect to the sentences meted out on Jimmy and Erik, the defence said that the accused’s culpability was lower than Jimmy and Erik as he was not involved in the spoofing conduct.

32     Erik had received a global sentence of 4 weeks’ imprisonment (the 4 week imprisonment terms for the spoofing conduct and the s 330 SFA charge were ordered to run concurrently). As such, it would be unjust for the accused to be sentenced to 4 weeks’ imprisonment, the same as Erik’s global sentence, when the accused was not involved in the spoofing conduct at all.

## Whether the custodial threshold had been crossed

33     Section 330(1) and (2) of the SFA reads as follows:

> **Duty not to furnish false statements to approved exchange, licensed trade repository, approved clearing house, recognised clearing house, authorised benchmark administrator, exempt benchmark administrator and Securities Industry Council**

> **330.—(1**)    Any person who, with intent to deceive, makes or furnishes, or knowingly and wilfully authorises or permits the making or furnishing of, any false or misleading statement or report to any approved exchange, licensed trade repository, approved clearing house, recognised clearing house, authorised benchmark administrator or exempt benchmark administrator, or to any officer of such persons —

>> (_a_)    while carrying on the activity of dealing in capital markets products;

>> ……

> shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $50,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both.

34     As the legislature has provided for the option of a fine and/or imprisonment for such offences, the key issue in this case is whether the custodial threshold had been crossed.

35     The prosecution submitted that one of the few reported cases involving an offence under s 330 SFA is _Soh Guan Cheow Anthony v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 3 SLR 147</span> (“Anthony Soh’s case”), where the accused was convicted after trial for various SFA breaches including the making of false statements under s 330 SFA. On appeal, the High Court upheld the sentences meted to the appellant by the District Court (after a trial) with regard the following s 330 SFA offences:

36     6 months’ imprisonment for the charge of knowingly and wilfully furnishing a false statement to SGX that he had purchased 5,500,000 shares in a listed company called Jade Technologies Holdings Ltd (where he was a director) on 21 January 2008, when he did not make such purchase, for the collateral purpose of setting the price of his general offer close to the price of this purported purchase of shares, where the offence was under s 330(1)(a) of the SFA.

37     3 months’ imprisonment for furnishing a false report to the Singapore Securities Industry Council stating that his company (Asia Pacific Links Ltd (“APLL”)) had given instructions to Standard Chartered Bank Jakarta to transmit two banker’s guarantees in the name of APLL for a total of US$200 million to satisfy a voluntary take-over offer by APLL of Jade Technologies Holdings Ltd when there were in fact no such instructions given to Standard Chartered Bank Jakarta. The report was deliberately given with the intention to deceive the Singapore Securities Industry Council and the offence was under s 330(2) of the SFA.

38     In _Anthony Soh’s_ case, the District Judge (“DJ”) reached the conclusion that the custodial threshold had been crossed for the various SFA breaches (including the s330 SFA charges) after taking into account the following factors \[at para 163\]:

> (a)     the enormous economic significance of the securities market;

> (b)     the potential for securities offences to undermine confidence in the integrity of a securities market, and disrupt fairness, orderliness, transparency and efficiency in the market;

> (c)     the disclosure-based regime which makes it important to ensure that market players comply with requirements relating to the quality and quantity of information disclosed;

> (d)     the impact on victims of the securities offences;

> (e)     the need for general deterrence given the vast opportunity for illicit financial gain; and

> (f)     the difficulty in detecting, investigating and prosecuting securities offences

39     Even if the facts that surrounded the s 330 SFA charges in Anthony Soh’s case had taken place on a grander scale with Soh participating in other breaches of the SFA as well, I find that the factors cited by the DJ above are applicable to the present case.

40     In _PP v Ng Sae Kiat_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 191</span>, Chao Hick Tin JA noted that the objectives of the SFA was as follows:

> “…the SFA is intended to achieve the following ends: (a) protect investors; b) protect public confidence in the market, and (c) ensure that the operation of the market is not distorted.”

41     In the circumstances, in ascertaining whether the custodial threshold had been crossed in the present case, I examined the following factors:

> a)     the harm occasioned by the conduct; and

> b)     the accused culpability

42     I then considered to these factors in the context of the objectives of the SFA cited in _Ng Sae Kiat’s_ case as well as the factors highlighted by the DJ in _Anthony Soh’s_ case.

43     I also considered the relevant mitigating factors and the principle of parity in arriving at the final sentence.

#### Harm

44     In the Statement of Facts, the accused had admitted to the following:

> The accused knew the statement … \[to SGX-DT\] to be untrue. **It was the accused who conceived and drafted the reply**, which Jimmy and Erik agreed to.

> On 28 July 2015, the accused sent the reply containing the false statement to SGX-DT through UOBBF, copying Erik. **The accused admitted that he knowingly helped Jimmy to explain away Jimmy’s illegal trading activity to avoid further trouble with SGX-DT** \[emphasis mine\].

45     Simply put, the false statement drafted by the accused and sent to SGX-DT was designed to conceal Jimmy’s spoofing conduct from SGX-DT who had begun making enquiries through UOBBF.

46     The Statement of Facts further explains what spoofing is:

> At the material time, Jimmy had engaged in what is known as spoofing on SGN15. Briefly, Jimmy tried to give a false impression of either demand or supply on one side of the order book of SGN15 by placing a large number of orders on either the buy side (at or below the prevailing best bid prices) or the ask side (at or above the prevailing best ask prices) without the intention to execute the order(s). At the same time he entered the spoof orders, he would place genuine orders to trade on the other side of the order book. The objective of Jimmy’s spoofing trading conduct was to obtain superior bid prices or ask prices than he could otherwise obtain.

47     In the Statement of Facts relating to Jimmy’s case (DAC 909483-485/2019), SGX had received a complaint on 24 July 2015 from one GSA Capital Partners LLP that it had suffered trading losses of USD$5,000 as a result of deceptive trading practices in SGN15. The relevant account was under Joerik’s account which prompted SGX to request for more information from Joerik’s broker, UOBBF. As a result of the spoof trades on 24 July 2015, Jimmy made a profit of $13,160. Jimmy plead guilty to a charge under s 210(a) SFA for the 24 July 2015 conduct for employing a scheme to defraud other market participants. On 27 March 2019 PDJ Ong Hian Sun (“PDJ Ong”) sentenced him to 12 weeks’ imprisonment. For another charge of engaging in spoofing conduct on 27 July 2015, he was sentenced to 4 weeks’ imprisonment where he made a profit of $3,180. He was sentenced to 4 weeks’ imprisonment for conspiring with the accused and Erik for furnishing a false statement to SGX-DT which is identical to the present charge for which the accused has pleaded guilty. The jail terms for the spoofing conduct of 24 July 2015 and the s 330(1)(a) charge were ordered to run consecutively giving a global term of 16 weeks’ imprisonment. No appeal was filed by Jimmy against sentence.

48     Erik pleaded guilty to one charge under s 210(a) SFA for spoofing the market on 29 August 2016 and one charge under s 330(1)(a) for conspiring with the accused to furnish a false statement to the SGX–DT to conceal the act of spoofing (this was the TIC charge). From the Statement of Facts on the s 210(a) SFA charge, Erik had made a profit of USD$1,450 from his spoofing conduct. Erik was sentenced by PDJ Ong to 4 weeks’ imprisonment for each charge with both sentences to run concurrently with a global sentence of 4 weeks’ imprisonment. No appeal was filed by Erik against sentence.

49     Jimmy and Erik’s acts spoofing had actual market impact in that they enriched themselves (by $13,160 and USD$1,450 respectively) as well as caused financial loss to other market participants who had been defrauded by their trades (GSA Capital Partners LLP reported a loss of USD$5,000 to SGX-DT as a result of Jimmy’s spoofing conduct on 24 July 2015). It was a result of these complaints from GSA Capital Partners LLP that led SGX-DT to enquire through UOBBF about these accounts traded under Joerik . The statement subsequently composed by the accused and sent by him to SGX-DT through UOBBF was to falsely explain away Jimmy’s (in the case of the TIC charge, Erik’s) illegal trading activity in order to avoid further trouble with SGX-DT.

50     The fact that both Jimmy and Erik were sentenced to imprisonment terms of between 4 weeks’ to 12 weeks’ for the spoofing conduct reflects the seriousness of the underlying conduct for which the accused, Jimmy and Erik had conspired to conceal.

51     Recalling the purpose of the SFA as espoused in _Ng Sae Kiat’s_ case, namely (a) protect investors; b) protect public confidence in the market, and (c) ensure that the operation of the market is not distorted, I find that the false statement furnished by the accused to SGX-DT was designed to conceal spoofing conduct that had caused actual financial losses to market participants, as well as a distortion of market operations by creating a false impression of either demand or supply on one side of the order book.

52     As noted by the DJ in _Anthony Soh’s_ case, securities market operated on a disclosure-based regime which makes it important to ensure that market players comply with requirements relating to the quality and quantity of information disclosed.

53     To my mind, the act of spoofing and the attempt to conceal it in this case can be seen as a continuum of events.There is a need to ensure that such acts such market harming conduct should be properly disclosed, investigated and prosecuted, otherwise this would undermine confidence in the integrity of the securities market, and disrupt fairness, orderliness, transparency and efficiency of the market.

#### The accused’s culpability

54     The defence submitted that the accused should be less culpable than Jimmy and Erik as he was not involved in the spoofing conduct. However, it bears repeating that Jimmy and Erik had been charged and dealt with separately for both the spoofing conduct and sanctioned separately for the spoofing conduct and the s330 SFA conduct.

55     I note that the accused had already known at the material time on 24 July 2015 of Jimmy’s illegal trading activity on SGD15, even before SGX-DT initiated the query on 27 July 2015. When SGX-DT raised the query on 27 July 2015, the accused was the architect of the false statement, in conspiring with Jimmy (and Erik for the TIC charge) in the present charge to conceal those acts of spoofing by them. After drafting the statement he asked Jimmy to “read through and see if it’s justifiable” because if he is invited “for a coffee session at SGX, must be able to stand with this claim \[SIC\]”. Jimmy agreed to the statement without amendments and the accused subsequently sent this false statement to SGX-DT through UOBBF.

56     The accused was Jimmy’s superior and by the defence’s own submission, the accused treated Jimmy as a “little brother”. In other words, Jimmy looked up to the accused for guidance. Yet, instead of guiding Jimmy to make a proper disclosure to SGX-DT on Jimmy’s spoofing conduct, he conspired with Jimmy and Erik to conceal that conduct.

57     I did not accept the defence’s submission that the accused’s conduct was purely altruistic to help Jimmy. In court, defence counsel conceded the accused also had to look out for Joerik which was his firm. Joerik faced potential sanctions given that the spoofing activity by Jimmy (and Erik) were under its trading account and further, the accused was a Director and co-owner of 50% of Joerik. The accused fronted their reply to SGX –DT through UOBBF. The defence had, in fact, highlighted in their mitigation an instance where Joerik had, through an offer of settlement to the SGX, paid a sum of $30,000 and disgorgement of profits of $20,326.50 through the conduct of their trader for trades unrelated to the present charge.

58     Further, the accused conduct was not one-off. When his colleague Erik engaged in spoofing more than a year later, the accused engaged in similar conduct under s 330 SFA which led to the TIC charge.

59     In the circumstances, even if the accused did not engage in the spoofing conduct, with respect to the SFA charge, the accused was at least equally, if not more culpability than Jimmy and Erik in terms of the drafting of the false statement which was meant to conceal their spoofing conduct and meant to withstand SGX’s scrutiny.

#### Relevance of false statements offences made under other statutes

60     Defence counsel cited examples of case under other acts (s 28 of the Prevention of Corruption Act (“PCA”), section 182 of the Penal Code and section 402 of the Companies Act) where a fines had been imposed in some cases for the furnishing of false to authorities. My first observation is that s 330 SFA carried the most serious penalty of $50,000 fine and/or 2 years imprisonment compared to these other statutes. Section 28 PCA carried a fine of $10,000 and/or 1 year’s imprisonment. Section 182 Penal Code carries a $5,000 fine and/or 1 year’s imprisonment. Section 402 Companies Act carried a $10,000 fine and/or 2 years’ imprisonment. There had also been cases in these other statutes where jail terms have been imposed as well.

61     To my mind, whether the false statement would cross the custodial threshold would need to be construed on the context of the specific statute and the facts of each case.

62     In _Seng Hwee Kiang v PP_ MA 9114/2016, the appellant was convicted under s 28(b) read with s 29(a) PCA of abetting one Koh for knowingly giving a false statement to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (“CPIB”). She did so as her close friend was under CPIB investigations and she was hopeful that Koh’s statement would vindicate her good friend. Koh eventually chose not to make the false statement despite the appellant’s pleas. She was sentenced to 3 weeks’ imprisonment but on appeal See Kee Oon J substituted the jail term with a fine of $8,000. See J noted that there was no actual harm caused but that there would have been potential harm had the false statement been given by Koh as the CPIB would have been led on a wild goose chase and resources would have been expended. See J ruled that the custodial threshold had not been crossed as the actual and potential harm was limited.

63     In _Teo Lip Hock v PP_ MA 263/97 a director of a company was convicted after trial for 2 charges under s 402 Companies Act for permitting the making of false statements in seven payment vouchers with intent to deceive the company’s auditors. He was fined $1,000 while the principal offender was fined $10,000. The trial judge took into consideration the fact that the accused had first brought the matter to the attention of the police and the company suffered no damage as the accounts were corrected.

64     The defence submitted in the present case that the accused was made in a one off situation to protect his close friend Jimmy whereas Teo Lip Hock permitted the making of false statements in seven payment voucher and no damage was done in the present case as in _Teo Lip Hock’s_ case.

65     In _Koh Yong Chiah v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 3 SLR 447</span>, the appellant was an ex school principal and senior public servant and had pleaded guilty to an offence under s 182 Penal Code for falsely telling his cluster superintendent that he was not having an extra-martial affair with a school vendor. When he was principal of various schools, he had approved $3.2m worth of contracts awarded by his school to his mistress’ companies. He was sentenced to 4 weeks’ imprisonment which was upheld on appeal.

66     The defence sought to distinguish _Koh Yong Chiah_ case from the present one by submitted that the accused conduct in seeking to protect Jimmy from any potential ramifications would not have caused actual or potential harm as Jimmy had traded in an errant manner and had stopped as a result of the enquiry. Further the provision of false information was one off and not continue for any length of time and did not impact market prices.

67     In my view, both _Seng Hwee Kiang_ and _Teo Lip Hock’s_ case can be distinguished from the present case as there was no actual harm occasioned by the false statement. As I had mentioned above, securities market operated on a disclosure-based regime which makes it important to ensure that market players comply with requirements relating to the quality and quantity of information disclosed. The act of spoofing and the attempt to conceal it in this case operated as a continuum of events, and there is therefore a need to ensure that such acts such market harming conduct such as spoofing should be properly disclosed, investigated and prosecuted, otherwise this would undermine confidence in the integrity of the securities market, and disrupt fairness, orderliness, transparency and efficiency of the market.

68     In _PP v Wang Ziyi Able_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGHC 37</span>, the accused was charged under s 199(b) SFA with disseminating information on an online forum that was false in material particulars . In allowing the prosecution’s appeal against a fine and imposing a term of six months’ imprisonment, VK Rajah JA held \[at para 30\]:

> Imposing a custodial rather than a fine in the represent case, will serve deter potential offenders who might otherwise be willing to risk a monetary slap on the wrist if and when they are apprehended.

69     In the same vein, there is a need in the present case for general deterrence given the possibilities of illicit financial gains and losses to market participants (as was the case here) and the difficulty in detecting, investigating and prosecuting securities offences.

70     Further, the accused furnished a false statement to SGX-DT not once but twice for the TIC charge with regard to Erik’s spoofing conduct, and this took place more than a year after Jimmy’s conduct.

71     In the circumstances, I am of the view that the custodial threshold had clearly been crossed in view of the actual harm caused and the level of culpability of the accused.

#### Mitigating factors

72     In _Anthony Soh’s_ case, jail terms of 3 month and 6 months were imposed for the s 330 SFA charges after had claimed trial and was convicted on the charges.

73     In _PP v Leong Soon Keong_ \[2009\] SLR 63, the Court of Appeal held that a plea of guilt will have mitigating effect where it is motivated by genuine remorse, contriteness or regret and/or a desire to facilitate the administration of justice as demonstrated by an early bid to be cooperative with investigating authorities. To this end, I accept that the accused should be accorded some sentencing discount on account of his plea of guilt.

74     That said, the present case needs to be distinguished from _Teo Lip Hock’s case_ where the accused had first brought the matter to the attention of the police and the company suffered no damage as the accounts were corrected. The accused’s actions in the present case were designed for precisely the opposite result, to conceal the conduct withstand SGX scrutiny.

75     Given the scale of illicit activity was not as large as in Anthony’s Soh’s case as well as the accused’s pleas of guilt, the custodial term in the present case would be measured in weeks rather than months. A term of 4 weeks’ imprisonment would be appropriate in the circumstances.

#### The principle of parity

76     In _PP v Ramlee_ \[1998\] 3 SLR 95 Yong CJ stated at \[7\]:

> Where two or more offenders are to be sentenced for participation in the same offence, the sentences passed on them should be the same, unless there is a relevant difference in their responsibility for the offence or their personal circumstances: see _Archbold_ (1998), para 5-153. An offender who has received a sentence that is significantly more severe than has been imposed on his accomplice, and there being no reason for the differentiation, is a ground of appeal if the disparity is serious. This is even where the sentences viewed in isolation are not considered manifestly excessive: see _R v Walsh_ (1980) 2 Cr App R (S) 224. In _R v Fawcett_ (1983) 5 Cr App R (S) 158, Lawton LJ held that the test was whether \`right-thinking members of the public, with full knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, learning of this sentence consider that something had gone wrong with the administration of justice?

77     Both Jimmy and Erik had been sentenced to four weeks’ imprisonment for the s 330 SFA charge. Erik had his two terms of imprisonment for the spoofing and s 330 SFA charge run currently resulting in a global sentence of 4 weeks’ imprisonment. In the cases of Jimmy, as he had three terms of imprisonment, at least two of the imprisonment sentences had to run consecutively by virtue of section 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code which lead to a global sentence of 16 week’s imprisonment.

78     Defence counsel argued that as that Erik had a global sentence of 4 weeks’ imprisonment, it would be unjust to impose a similar sentence on the accused for the s 330 SFA charge.

79     With respect, one needs to construe the actual jail term imposed on Erik and Jimmy for the s 330 SFA charge separately from the s 210 SFA charge. In the case of Jimmy and Erik, it was the same term, namely 4 weeks’ imprisonment.

80     The fact that PDJ Ong ordered Erik’s jail term to run concurrently is a separate matter from the actual sentence imposed for each charge.

81     On the facts, I saw no reason to displace the principle of parity and give a lesser sentence on the s 330 SFA charge than that of his co-conspirators Jimmy and Erik. Even if the accused was not involved in the spoofing, the accused had the biggest role with respect to the s 330 SFA charge as the architect of the false statement concealing the spoofing conduct of his colleagues which he sent to the SGX-DT through UOBBF.

## Conclusion

82     In the circumstances I sentenced the accused to 4 weeks’ imprisonment on the s330 SFA charge.

83     The accused immediately filed an appeal upon sentence. He was granted a stay of execution pending appeal and is currently on bail bond of $5,000.
