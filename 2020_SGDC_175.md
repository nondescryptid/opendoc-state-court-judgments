9 July 2020

### District Judge Ow Yong Tuck Leong:

1       The accused, Toh Jian Rui, a 31-year-old male, pleaded guilty to the 3 charges reproduced below:

> DAC-904951-2019

> “You…Toh Jian Rui…are charged that you, on the 2nd day of November 2017, at or about 3.02am, at 29 Jalan Besar, Singapore, knowing yourself likely to cause grievous hurt, did cause grievous hurt to one Chin Kar Weng, to wit, by punching him multiple times, thereby resulting in a depressed fracture of his right maxillary sinus, bony septum and right ala of the nasal bone, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 325 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.”

> DAC-922745-2019

> “You…Toh Jian Rui…are charged that you, on or about 20 July 2019, in Singapore, did consume a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act, (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), _to wit_, methamphetamine, without any authorisation under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 8(b)(ii) of the said Act, and further, that you, before the commission of the said offence, were on 15 November 2013, pursuant to an order made by the Ag. Deputy Director of the Central Narcotics Bureau in Singapore under section 34(2)(b) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), admitted to an approved institution, namely, Drug Rehabilitation Centre, Cluster B, Changi Prison Complex, for consumption of a specified drug, _to wit_, methamphetamine, and were on 27 November 2015, pursuant to an order made by the Deputy Director of the Central Narcotics Bureau in Singapore under section 34(2)(b) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), admitted to an approved institution, namely, Drug Rehabilitation Centre, Cluster B, Changi Prison Complex for consumption of a specified drug, _to wit_, methamphetamine, and you are thereby liable to be punished under section 33A(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed).

> DAC-925453-2019

> “You…Toh Jian Rui…be charged that you, on 20 July 2019, at about 12.50 a.m., at 26A Lorong H Telok Kurau S(426012), Singapore, did have in your possession a “Class A” controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), to wit, one packet containing not less than 0.10 grams of crystalline substance and one 6-ml Terumo syringe containing about 1 ml of clear liquid which were analysed and found to contain methamphetamine, without authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 8(a), which is punishable under section 33(1) of the said Act.”

2       The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification. I found him guilty and convicted him accordingly. Two other charges, one under s 325 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”) and the other under s 9 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”), were consented by the accused to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

3       I sentenced the accused to two years’ and three months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for DAC-904951-2019 (first charge), five years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane for DAC-922745-2019 (third charge) and 12 months’ imprisonment for DAC-925453-2019 (fourth charge), with the first and third charges to run consecutively for an aggregate sentence of seven years’ and three months’ imprisonment and nine strokes of the cane.

4       The accused, being dissatisfied with the sentence, has filed an appeal against the sentence I imposed. He is currently serving his imprisonment sentence. I set out the grounds of my decision below.

### Statement of Facts

5       The SOF relating to the commission of the offences by the accused, without the still images from the CCTV footage capturing the incident, are reproduced below:

> 1.    The accused is Toh Jian Rui, Male/31 years old…D.O.B…NRIC No…Singapore Citizen (the “accused”).

> FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 1 ST CHARGE (DAC-904951-2019)

> 2.    The victim is Chin Kar Weng, Male, 36 years old (“Jimmy”).

> 3.    The witness is Chua Yong Yan, Justin, Male, 31 years old (“Justin”).

> 4.    Jimmy and Justin are friends, and were unknown to the accused at the time of the incident.

> 5.    On 2 November 2017, at around 3.04am, police received a “999” call with the message “_Big fight over here. Send police fast_.” The incident location given was Petain Road x Jalan Besar.

> 6.    Investigations revealed that on 2 November 2017, at around 3.02am, the witness and victim had left Ye Shanghai Pub (“the pub”), located at 29 Jalan Besar, Singapore.

> 7.    After leaving the pub, they were standing along the corridor of the building. The accused was standing nearby. The accused claimed that Jimmy was staring at him, and a dispute between the two of them broke out thereafter.

> 8.    During the dispute, the accused walked to Jimmy and grabbed Jimmy’s throat. While holding Jimmy’s throat, the accused punched Jimmy once. Jimmy then attempted to punch the accused back twice. The accused retaliated by tackling Jimmy to the ground.

> 9.    Whilst on the ground, the accused pinned Jimmy down and punched him continuously for 16 seconds. Various members of the public attempted to intervene in order to stop the attack, but the accused pushed them away. Justin attempted to stop the fight as well.

> 10.    After being pulled away by multiple passers-by and Justin, the accused then turned to Justin, and punched him in the jaw. This is the subject of the TIC charge.

> 11.    The accused was then restrained by passers-by. He continued to struggle against these members of the public while shouting at the victims.

> 12.    Police resources were then called to attend to the scene, and Jimmy and Justin proceeded to seek treatment at Singapore General Hospital. Jimmy was warded for 3 days, and Justin was warded for 4 days. Jimmy was offered surgery, and Justin underwent surgery under general anaesthesia due to his injuries.

> 13.    By virtue of these attacks, Jimmy suffered the following injuries:

>> a.    2x2 cm bruise over the occipital region with tenderness; laceration of left lip;

>> b.    Bilateral periorbital bruise and swelling, unable to open left eye due to swelling;

>> c.    Right eye conjunctiva mild injected;

>> d.    Nose – swollen with bruise;

>> e.    Chipped tooth;

>> f.    Fracture of nasal bone/septum; and

>> g.    Fracture of anterior wall of right maxillary sinus

> 14.    Justin suffered multiple fractures in his jaw.

> 15.    The accused, knowing himself likely to cause grievous hurt, did cause grievous hurt to Jimmy, causing him to suffer multiple fractures, amongst other injuries.

> 16.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence of Voluntarily Causing Grievous Hurt under s 325 of the Penal Code. The accused stands charged accordingly.

> FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 3 RD CHARGE (DAC-922745-2019)

> 17.    On 20 July 2019 at around 12.50am, the accused was arrested by Police officers at 26A Lorong H Telok Kurau, Singapore 426012. During the arrest, one packet of crystalline substance, which was later sealed and marked as T-1, and one syringe containing clear liquid, which was later sealed and marked as T-2, were seized from the accused. Other items were also seized. They form the subject of the 5th Charge (TIC).

> 18.    After his arrest, the accused was brought to the Central Narcotics Bureau ‘G’ Division office, where he provided two bottles of his urine which were subsequently sealed “CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU” and marked C-SG-19-93027-1 TOH JIAN RUI SXXX and CSG-19-93027-2 TOH JIAN RUI SXXX. On 22 July 2019, both bottles of urine were submitted to HSA2 for analysis.

> 19.    On 23 July 2019, Zhang HuiFen Hannah, an analyst with the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of HSA, having conducted the analysis in relation to the sample C-SG-19-93027-1 TOH JIAN RUI SXXX, issued a certificate under Section 16 of the MDA3, stating that on analysis, the urine sample was found to contain methamphetamine.

> 20.    On 23 July 2019, Goh Mei Ling Evelyn, an analyst with the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of HSA, having conducted the analysis in relation to the sample C-SG-19-93027-2 TOH JIAN RUI SXXX, issued a certificate under Section 16 of the MDA, stating that on analysis, the urine sample was found to contain methamphetamine.

> 21.    The accused admitted to consuming “ice” (the street name for methamphetamine) on 19 July 2019. He consumed “ice” inside his bedroom at 26A Lorong H Telok Kurau, Singapore 426012, by smoking it. The accused admitted to consuming “ice” two to three times weekly, either by smoking it or drinking it after mixing it with water.

> 22.    Methamphetamine is a Specified Drug listed in the Fourth Schedule of the MDA. The accused is not authorised under the MDA or any of the Regulations made thereunder to consume methamphetamine, and he has thereby committed an offence under Section 8(b)(ii) MDA.

> 23.    Furthermore, on 15 November 2013 and on 27 November 2015, the accused was, under Section 34(2)(b) of the MDA, admitted to an Approved Institution, namely, the Drug Rehabilitation Centre, for treatment and rehabilitation. He is thereby liable for the enhanced punishment under Section 33A(1) of the MDA.

> FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 4 TH CHARGE (DAC-925453-2019)

> 24.    On 22 July 2019, after the accused was arrested, the items marked T-1 and T-2 (as set out in paragraph 17 above) were sent to HSA for analysis.

> 25.    On 7 August 2019, Chew Chin Na Gina, an analyst with the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of HSA, issued a certificate under Section 16 of the MDA bearing Laboratory Number TX-1931-04766, stating that T-2 was found to be one 6-ml Terumo syringe containing about 1 ml of clear liquid. Within the liquid, methamphetamine had been detected.

> 26.    On 14 August 2019, Teo Hui Ping, an analyst with the Illicit Drugs Laboratory of HSA, issued a certificate under Section 16 of the MDA bearing Laboratory Number ID-1932-01524-001, stating that T-1 was found to be one packet containing not less than 0.10 grams of crystalline substance which was analysed and found to contain methamphetamine

> 27.    The accused has admitted to ownership of T-1 and T-2 and said that they were meant for his own consumption.

> 28.    Methamphetamine is a Class A Controlled Drug listed in the First Schedule of the MDA. The accused is not authorised under the MDA or any of the Regulations made thereunder to be in possession of methamphetamine, and he has thereby committed an offence under Section 8(a) of the said Act.

> 29.    The accused stands charged accordingly.

#### Prescribed Penalties

6       The prescribed punishment for the first charge is imprisonment up to 10 years and also liable to a fine or caning. The prescribed punishment for the third charge is a minimum of five years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane and a maximum of seven years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. The prescribed punishment for the fourth charge is a maximum of 10 years’ imprisonment or $20,000 fine or both.

#### Antecedents

7       In 2012, the accused was sentenced to one month imprisonment for voluntary causing hurt under s 323 of the Penal Code, and four months’ imprisonment for criminal intimidation under s 506 of the Penal Code, with both sentences to run concurrently. On two previous occasions, 15 November 2013 and on 27 November 2015, the accused was, pursuant to an order under Section 34(2)(b) of the MDA, admitted to the Drug Rehabilitation Centre (“DRC”) for treatment and rehabilitation.

### Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

8       The learned DPP Jeremy Bin submitted that the sentencing framework for sentencing convicted offenders under s 325 of the Penal Code was set out in the Court of Appeal’s decision in _Public Prosecutor v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 127</span> (“_BDB_”).

9       In _BDB_, the Court of Appeal established a two-step sentencing framework. The first step was to consider the severity of the injury in determining the indicative starting point for sentencing. The second step was to consider the offender’s culpability in adjusting the eventual sentence, through assessing the aggravating and/or mitigating factors of the case.

10     The applicable sentencing principles in this case were general and specific deterrence and retribution. The Prosecution urged the court to impose a global sentence of seven years’ and six months’ imprisonment, and nine strokes of the cane, by running the sentences of the first charge, comprising two years’ and six months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane, and the third charge, comprising five years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane, consecutively.

11     In the present case, which involved multiple fractures to the face and where the victim was recommended/requires surgery, the indicative starting point based on sentencing precedents involving offenders who caused similar injuries and pleaded guilty was at least two years’ imprisonment, and six strokes of the cane. This starting point was applied in the Magistrate’s Appeal case of _Public Prosecutor v Ho Soo Kok_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] SGDC 134</span> (“_Ho Soo Kok_”), where the accused similarly went up to the victim, punched him, then continued to attack after the victim fell to the ground, until he was stopped by passers-by. _Ho Soo Kok_ was decided under the 1985 Penal Code, which imposed a lower maximum sentence of 7 years’ imprisonment for the same offence. However, while the maximum sentence had been increased to account for a greater range of harm and culpability across a variety of factual matrixes, the tariff for offences with similar harm has not increased commensurately. As such, this should remain the starting point.

12     Next, the Prosecution submitted that the following aggravating factors should be taken into account to cause an upward adjustment of the indicative sentence by six months to at least two years’ and six months’ imprisonment, and six strokes of the cane:

> (a)     The vicious and protracted duration of the attack.

> (b)     The attack happened in a public place.

> (c)     By his own admission, the accused was intoxicated.

> (d)     The accused had two violence-related antecedents for voluntarily causing hurt and criminal intimidation. His tendency towards violence had increased despite having served a custodial sentence for these prior offences.

13     With respect to the third charge, the accused was liable for the enhanced punishment under Section 33A(1) of the MDA. The Prosecution recognised the circumstances surrounding this offence, and was cognizant of the fact that the accused had taken steps to seek treatment and drug rehabilitation prior to his arrest. The Prosecution noted that the accepted uplift for an accused person who reoffends while on bail and commits a Long Term Imprisonment 1 (“LT-1”) offence would be an additional six months’ imprisonment (_Cheang Geok Lin v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 5</span> at \[37\], but did not seek an uplift of the mandatory minimum sentence of five years’ imprisonment, and three strokes of the cane for this charge.

14     With respect to the fourth charge, for the possession of a controlled drug, the Prosecution set out a sentencing precedent range of between eight and 24 months’ imprisonment for offenders caught with small or trace amounts of Class A drugs, used for personal consumption. The primary differentiating factor in determining where the accused falls within this range would be based on his drug-related antecedents. Offenders with no similar antecedents or admissions to DRC would have a lower sentence imposed.

15     In this case, the accused had been admitted to DRC on two separate occasions for drug consumption, of which both stints were extended. His culpability was therefore between that of the offender in _Tan Chong Leng v Public Prosecutor_ (MA 141/97), who had one stint in rehabilitation and was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment and that of the offender in _Arumugam s/o Rajamanickam v Public Prosecutor_ (MA 78/98), who had four previous admissions into DRC, and was sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment. The Prosecution sought a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment which was the lower end of the sentencing precedents for such offenders on account of the accused’s plea of guilt and trace amounts involved.

16     For the global sentence, the Prosecution submitted that the first charge was distinct from the third and fourth charges, and occurred independently as wholly separate transactions, in different years. The general rule, as stated by the High Court in _Public Prosecutor v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 799</span> (“_Raveen_”) at \[41\], \[48\], and \[98(b)\], was that an offender who was to be sentenced for convictions on multiple unrelated offences should be separately punished for each offence. This should be achieved by an order that the individual sentences run consecutively.

17     The Prosecution submitted that the sentence was also in keeping with the totality principle as set out in _Raveen_ and _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> (“_Shouffee_”) at \[78\], where the sentencing court must review the aggregate sentence and consider whether it was “sufficient and proportionate to the offender’s overall criminality”.

18     To determine whether the sentence was in keeping with the totality principle, the court should examine (a) if the global sentence was substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious individual offence; and (b) if the effect of the sentence would be crushing on the offender and not in keeping with his past records and future prospects. See _Shouffee_ at \[54\]-\[57\].

19     The most serious offence in this case was the LT-1 consumption offence that the accused had committed on court bail. The maximum sentence for this offence was seven years’ imprisonment, and six strokes of the cane. The global sentence sought by the Prosecution in the present case was six months and three strokes above that. In view of the seriousness and multiplicity of the accused’s offences, the uplift was necessary to satisfy the need for specific and general deterrence, as well as retribution, and to account for the accused’s high level of criminality in the circumstances. The global sentence was not a crushing one, and was in keeping with the accused’s past records and future prospects. The accused faced the LT-1 charge due to his previous entries into the DRC, and self-admitted long history of drug offending. Similarly, his attack on the two victims was particularly serious, and followed on from his two previous violence-related antecedents. As such, the accused had demonstrated persistent recalcitrance for both types of offences, and the aggregate sentence cannot be said to be crushing.

20     In addition, the totality principle must be balanced against the risk of giving an excessive discount by virtue of the totality principle. It would run contrary to the administration of justice if there was a reduction to the accused’s global sentence simply because he committed separate serious offences, both of which warrant lengthy custodial sentences.

### Mitigation

21     In his Mitigation Plea, Mr Wee, for the Defence stated three factors for consideration.

> (a)     The accused’s early plea of guilt had saved considerable costs and time.

> (b)     The accused was thoroughly remorseful for all his wrong doing and he undertook not to commit the same mistakes again.

> (c)     The accused wished to serve his sentence, turn over a new leaf and leave his chequered past behind. He felt especially contrite towards his parents and wished to devote himself to being a filial son.

22     The accused was unable to cope and manage stressful situations and that would lead to severe and intense outburst which temporarily robbed him of his senses. He had voluntarily sought treatment, with his parents’ guidance and assistance, from both private psychiatrists and Institute of Mental Health. The accused had realised his addiction problem and on his own will checked into National Addictions Management Services (“NAMS”) for a rehabilitation program.

23     Mr Wee submitted that a distinction should be drawn between “pure” abusers and those who face charges over other offences with the former being more deserving of a less punitive and more rehabilitative sentence. Although the accused faced charges for violent offences, these were separate events with no causation stemming from his drug addiction. As such, the accused’s earnest attempts at rehabilitating should warrant him a global discount in sentencing.

24     Factoring in the one-transaction principle, only the first charge should run consecutive with the third charge. Factoring in the totality principle collectively with the accused’s mitigating factors, the individual sentences should be adjusted for a global six years’ and three months’ imprisonment sentence, comprising one year and three months’ imprisonment for the first charge and the mandatory minimum five years’ imprisonment for the third charge.

25     Mr Wee submitted that the sentence meted out for s 325 offences ranged from 12 to 18 months’ imprisonment. He referred to the case _of Public Prosecutor v Lau Heng Long, Angelo_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 132</span> (_“Angelo”_), where the accused was sentenced to 20 months’ imprisonment for s 325 offence, and submitted that 20 months’ imprisonment should be the starting point and the sentence should be calibrated downwards to 15 months’ imprisonment due to the mitigating factors cited. In reply, the Prosecutor pointed out that _Angelo_ did not discuss sentencing.

### Court’s Decision

26     The applicable principles were set out by the Court of Appeal in _BDB_. The Court of Appeal undertook a comprehensive survey of the relevant authorities and the sentencing considerations for offences under s 325 of the Penal Code (see _BDB_ at \[39\]–\[76\]) and set out a two-step sentencing approach for such offences.

27     First, the seriousness of the hurt caused to the victim should guide the court’s determination of the indicative starting point for sentencing because grievous hurt has been caused (at \[55(a)\]). Where the grievous hurt is in the form of death, the indicative starting point should be a term of imprisonment of around eight years (at \[56\]). Where the grievous hurt caused is multiple fractures to various parts of the body of the type and gravity in the sixth charge in _BDB_ (fractures to elbow, calve and ribs), the indicative starting point should be a term of imprisonment of around three years and six months (at \[56\]). These indicative starting points might be higher or lower according to the type and seriousness of injuries caused (at \[55\]-\[56\]).

28     In this case, the medical report of the first victim stated that he was admitted to Singapore General Hospital (“SGH”) between 2 and 4 November 2017. The medical examinations showed the following injuries:

> (a)     2x2 cm bruise over the occipital region with tenderness;

> (b)     Laceration of left lip;

> (c)     Bilateral periorbital bruise and swelling, unable to open left eye due to swelling;

> (d)     Right eye conjunctiva mild injected;

> (e)     Nose swollen with bruise;

> (f)     Chipped tooth;

> (g)     Fracture of nasal bone/septum; and

> (h)     Fracture of anterior wall of right maxillary sinus.

29     The head is a sensitive and critical part of the body. The first victim suffered facial fractures, comminuted fractures of the nasal bone and nasal septum. He was offered surgery when he was examined at SGH, and I considered this to be a relevant factor insofar as it represented a medical professional’s opinion on the seriousness of the injuries. He was well enough to be discharged on 4 November 2017. It was fortuitous that the first victim did not suffer more severe injuries. In the circumstances, bearing in mind that these were serious but less severe injuries compared to _BDB_, I set the indicative starting point at 18 months’ imprisonment for the injuries caused to the first victim.

30     Step two of the _BDB_ sentencing approach was to assess the aggravating and mitigating factors. The non-exhaustive factors identified by _BDB_ include the manner and duration of the attack and antecedents, which fall squarely within the Prosecution’s submissions on aggravating factors. According to the SOF, the accused walked to the first victim and grabbed his throat. While holding the victim’s throat, the accused punched the victim. When the victim tried to fight back, the accused tackled the victim to the ground and continuously punched the victim for 16 seconds, despite the passer-by’s efforts to pull him away. After being pulled away by multiple passers-by, he turned and punched the second victim in the jaw, causing multiple fractures to the second victim’s jaw, which is the subject of the TIC charge. The second victim was hospitalised for four days and underwent surgery under general anaesthesia due to his injuries. The accused’s behaviour was extremely aggravating. I accepted the Prosecution’s submission to make an upward adjustment and I increased it by nine months, to two years’ and three months’ imprisonment with the second s 325 charge under the Penal Code taken into consideration to increase the sentence. Although the Prosecution had said that the accused had admitted to be intoxicated, this was not stated in the SOF, and I did not consider this factor in adjusting the sentence upwards.

31     On the other hand, the relevant mitigating factors identified by _BDB_ include the offender’s mental condition, genuine remorse and personal financial or social problems. The CCTV showed how the incident had unfolded, and the accused would have known that the Prosecution would have no difficulty proving the charge against him. I was of the view that the accused’s plea of guilt should have little or no mitigation value. See _Public Prosecutor v Tay Beng Guan Albert_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 2 SLR(R) 778</span> at \[16\]. I did not find any mitigating factors to adjust the sentence downwards.

32     Mr Wee submitted that the starting point should be the lower sentence of 20 months’ imprisonment without any caning, decided by the trial judge in _Angelo._ The common refrain by the courts is that sentencing precedents are of little precedential value where there were no written grounds explaining the sentences imposed (see _BDB_ at \[43\]). In _Angelo_, there were no reasoned grounds to shed light on how the sentence was arrived at as it was an appeal on conviction not sentence. It was of no assistance in the present case.

33     For cases prosecuted under s 325 of the Penal Code, the courts have invariably imposed caning in addition to imprisonment sentences, with retribution as the likely principal sentencing consideration, unless there were exceptional circumstances. Under the _BDB_ sentencing approach, where death was caused, a sentence of 12 or more strokes of the cane may be warranted. Where non-fatal serious injury was caused, a sentence of between six and 12 strokes of the cane might be considered (at \[76\]). For this charge, I sentenced the accused to two years’ and three months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.

34     Mr Wee did not raise any objections to the Prosecution’s submissions for the third and fourth charges. I accepted the Prosecution’s submissions for the third charge. I noted the reasons for seeking only the mandatory minimum sentence, and imposed the mandatory minimum sentence of five years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane. I also accepted the Prosecution’s submissions and imposed a 12 months’ imprisonment sentence for the fourth charge.

#### Aggregate Sentence

35     The accused had pleaded guilty to three charges. It was not disputed that the first charge and the third charge should be run consecutively pursuant to s 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68). I ordered the sentences for the grievous hurt and drug consumption charges to run consecutively as they were separate and unrelated offences that protect different interests. Ordering the sentences for these two charges to run consecutively would be in line with the one-transaction rule in _Shouffee._

36     As for the totality principle, I considered the aggregate sentence to be proportionate to the gravity of the accused’s offences and not crushing, having regard also to his antecedents and his present age of 31. I agreed with the Prosecution’s submissions that the aggregate sentence did not run afoul of the totality principle, and there should be no further discount on the aggregate sentence. The totality principle must be balanced against the risk of giving an excessive discount by virtue of the totality principle.

37     The accused had been in remand since 8 August 2019. I ordered the aggregate sentence of seven years’ and three months’ imprisonment and nine strokes of the cane, to take effect from 8 August 2019.
