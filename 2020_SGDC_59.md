> and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 49(c) of the Trade Marks Act, Chapter 332.

## B.   The Relevant Statutory Provisions and the Punishment Prescribed by Law

2       Section 49 (c) of the Trade Marks Act provides that any person who has in his possession for the purpose of trade or manufacture, any goods to which a registered trade mark is falsely applied shall, unless he proves that —

> (i)    having taken all reasonable precautions against committing an offence under this section, he had, at the time of the commission of the alleged offence, no reason to suspect the genuineness of the mark and on demand made by or on behalf of the prosecution, he gave all the information in his power with respect to the persons from whom he obtained the goods; or

> (ii)  he had acted innocently,

be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 for each goods or thing to which the trade mark is falsely applied (but not exceeding in the aggregate $100,000) or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.

3       As regards to the definition of “false application”, Section 47(2) of the Trade Marks Act states as follows:

> (2)    For the purposes of this section and sections 49, 53 and 53A, a person falsely applies a registered trade mark to goods or services if—

>> (a)    without the consent of the proprietor of the registered trade mark, the person applies the trade mark or a sign likely to be mistaken for that trade mark to the goods or services; and

>> (b)    in the case of an application to goods, the goods are not the genuine goods of the proprietor or licensee of the registered trade mark.

4       Section 47(6) of the Trade Marks Act also provides that “in a prosecution under this section or section 49, the burden of proving the consent of the proprietor lies on the accused”

5       During the course of the trial, the Prosecution had informed me on 10 April 2019 that they did not wish to proceed with DAC 939833-2017 against the Accused and they had applied for a discharge not amounting to an acquittal in respect of the said charge. The Defence Counsel did not object to the Prosecution’s application and I did order a discharge not amounting to an acquittal in respect of DAC 939833-2017 on 10 April 2019.

6       As for DAC 939832-2017, at the conclusion of the trial, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him of the charge. On 6 March 2020, I imposed a sentence of 3 month’s imprisonment on the Accused for DAC 939832-2017 after considering the Prosecution’s submission on sentence and the Defence’s mitigation plea.

7       As for DAC 939833-2017, the Prosecution applied for a Discharge Amounting to an Acquittal (“DATA”) for DAC 939833-2017 on 6 March 2020 and I granted the Prosecution their application accordingly.

8       I hereby set out my reasons for both the conviction and sentence.

## C.   Agreed and Undisputed Facts

9       In the present case, both the Prosecution and Defence have agreed on certain facts in order to reduce the areas of disputes and they have tendered an Agreed Statement of Facts[^1] stipulating certain agreed facts.

10     The salient agreed facts are as follows:-

> i.     The Accused is the sole proprietor of the business XKoo Tech, which is in the business of selling, inter alia, electronics products and he operates XKoo Tech out of the premises located at 1 Yishun Industrial Street 1 #04-26 A’Posh Bizhub Singapore (“the premises”).

> ii.     The Accused registered XKoo Tech sometime in 2013 and sold mobile phone accessories such as mobile phone casings, phone batteries, cables and chargers, and screen protectors online. The business of XKoo Tech increased over the years since 2013, with the Accused importing goods from various suppliers in the People’s Republic of China. The Accused would look for suppliers from Shenzhen, China and would fly to Shenzhen to view the wares.

> iii.     The Accused’s business was carried out online, and items would be sold online platforms such as Lazada, Qoo10, and Carousell using the seller ID “ePlaza” (for Lazada and Carousell) and “ePlaza.sg” (for Qoo10). The Accused was the sole person in charge of the accounts tied to these seller IDs. The Accused would list the various items offered for sale on these 3 platforms. When a customer purchased an item from the Accused via any of the online platforms, the Accused would make arrangements for the item to either be delivered to the customer, or for the customer to collect the item at the premises.

> iv.     On 13 March 2017 at about 2.05 pm, acting on information received, Station Inspector Ong Chee Hien, a police officer attached to the Intellectual Property Rights Branch (“IPRB”) of the Criminal Investigation Department (“CID”), together with a party of police officers, conducted a raid on the premises. At the time of the raid, the Accused was present and at the premises. In the presence of the Accused, a search was conducted and the items seized included the following:-

>> a.       2,654 pieces of Samsung products

>> b.       62 Apple Magsafe Power Adapters

>> c.       23 Apple Power Adapters

>> d.       22 Apple Earpieces

>> e.       58 Apple USB Cables

>> f.       36 Apple Iphone Batteries

>> g.       5 Apple Micro USB Adapters

>> h.       13 Beats Headphones

> v.     The Accused accepted that items b. to h. were in his possession for the purposes of trade.

> vi.     In the course of the raid, the police officers also seized the following items, which contained records of XKoo Tech’s business:-

>> a.       1 Acer laptop with charger

>> b.       1 stack of documents

> vii.     In relation to DAC 939832-2017, the following 198 Apple products which were subsequent examined by Ying Yi Lian Elaine (“PW2”), the IP Enforcement Manager for Apple Inc for Southeast Asia Pacific (“Apple”) :-

![]([2020] SGDC 0059_Image/[2020] SGDC 0059_image4.png)

> viii.     The above registered trademarks were valid and subsisting at the time of the seizure.

## D.   The Prosecution’s Case

11     The Prosecution had called on 3 witnesses to give evidence on their behalf in their case against the Accused. They are:

> a.     PW1 – Senior Investigation Officer Gordon Chay, Criminal Investigation Department, who is the investigating officer in charge of this case

> b.     PW2 – Ying Li Lian Elaine, the IP Enforcement Manager from Apple Inc

> c.     PW3 – Heng Guey Yann Thomas, Assistant Manager, IM Service Operations, Samsung Asia Pte Ltd

12     PW1 and PW2 had given evidence in relation to DAC 939832-2017 while PW3 was Samsung’s representative who gave evidence in relation to DAC 939833-2017. PW2 was Apple’s representative and expert who had examined the 198 Apple products which were seized by the police (“the Goods”).

13     In addition to the 3 witnesses, the Prosecution had also tendered a total of 52 exhibits which included PW2’s Examination Report[^2] on the 198 Apple products.

14     The Prosecution’s case is simple. The Examination Report prepared by PW2 in P32 (“the Examination Report”) establishes that the Goods are counterfeit Apple products and have falsely applied trade marks belonging to Apple. The Accused had also in the Agreed Statement of Facts admitted that he possessed the Goods for the purposes of trade[^3].

15     The Prosecution’s position is that the Accused had purchased the Goods from unknown suppliers in China without taking reasonable precautions to determine whether the Goods were genuine. There were also red flags in the pricing and packaging of the Goods which should have led the accused to question the authenticity of the Goods[^4].

## E.   PW1’s evidence

16     PW1 had testified that he was a senior investigating officer with the IPRB and he had been working with the branch for 2 years[^5]. On 13 March 2017, PW1 and his colleagues raided the premises. They had acted on information that the premises was involved in the selling of counterfeit items[^6].

17     During the raid, PW1 and his colleagues seized 3 brands of products which they suspected were counterfeit – namely Beats, Apple and Samsung products[^7]. The seized products were taken back to their office and a seizure report was lodged[^8].

18     After items were seized, the police invited the different rights owners to examine the seized goods[^9]. For the Goods, the rights owners informed the police that the Goods seized were all counterfeit[^10].

19     As regards to the Accused’s invoices or contracts with his suppliers in relation to the seized products, PW1 was not able to find any such documents from the items seized[^11]. PW1 was only able to find invoices for the Accused’s daily operation whereby customers had placed orders from him. A forensic preview of the laptop which was seized from the Accused also showed only invoices relating to the Accused’s day to day operation in his laptop[^12].

20     PW1 did ask the Accused as to where he got the seized products from as well as the name of his suppliers and also to provide whatever invoices that he had but the Accused did not produce any invoices to PW1[^13].

21     PW1 also testified that based on his investigation and the Accused’s statement to him, the seized items had originated from Shenzhen China from a place called Hua Qiang Bei[^14]. PW1 further testified that although the Accused had given him the names of 3 suppliers, that was all the information that the Accused had given PW1 and the Accused did not furnish to PW1 any invoices or gave PW1 an documents to substantiate his claim[^15]. The Accused only gave PW1 the names of the suppliers[^16]. The Accused also told PW1 that he did not have the invoices[^17]. PW1 was also not able to find any invoices from the Accused’s suppliers from the premises[^18].

22     As for Hua Qiang Bei, PW1 also testified that Hua Qiang Bei is a mall area in Shenzhen, China which is “notorious for counterfeit goods”[^19].

## F.   PW2’s evidence

23     PW2 is the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Enforcement Manager for Apple Inc and the scope of her job is to help Apple Inc enforce their IPR in the region[^20]. PW2 has been working for Apple since 1 July 2013. Before that, she was the IPR Enforcement Manager for Nokia and prior to that, she was the head of the IPR Enforcement branch in the Criminal Investigation Department[^21],

24     As part of her training with Apple Inc, PW2 was sent to Cupertino in San Francisco USA to attend an induction programme where she was introduced to all the intellectual property rights of Apple. PW2 was also attached to the factories which manufacture the different Apple products which were mainly based in China as part of her training. In addition, PW2 is also supported by Apple engineers who are able to help her go through Apple databases to track the products that Apple manufacture including the checking of serial numbers of the Apple products[^22].

25     In the present case, PW2 had examined the Goods which were seized by the police in relation to this case and she also prepared her Examination Report on the Goods[^23].

26     PW2 had testified that she had personally examined the Goods on 3 May 2018 and she was of the view that the Goods were all counterfeit[^24]. PW2 had also prepared an Examination Report for the Goods and her reasons for finding that the Goods are counterfeit and that Apple’s trade mark have been falsely applied to the Goods are set out in the Examination Report.

27     PW2’s findings can be summarised as follows[^25]:-

I also noted because of the position taken by the Defence, the Defence had decided not to cross examine PW2 or her Examination Report on the above items when she was on the stand.

29     As regards to the place known as Hua Qiang Bei where the Accused had purchased the Goods from, PW2 had testified that she would not buy from Hua Qiang Bei if she were a business person looking for genuine products[^40]. According to PW2, Hua Qiang Bei is an area that Apple is extremely concerned about. It is not just 1 mall or 2 malls but a concentration of 10 to 12 malls with each mall being about 6 to 8 storeys high. Inside each mall, there are kiosks set up which sells all sorts of popular electronic products. PW2 had also testified that Hua Qiang Bei is notorious black market which is about the size of New York business district and it is an electronic wholesale market for counterfeit goods[^41].

30     In this case, after the Prosecution had closed its case, I had requested for PW2 to be recalled for the sole purpose of giving information regarding the recommended retail pricing of Apple goods. PW2 did furnish me Apple’s recommended retail price in relation to the Goods[^42]. PW2 also testified that based on her experience, there can be a big difference in the price of a counterfeit product and Apple’s recommended retail pricing for Apple accessories. According to PW2, for wholesalers in places like Hua Qiang Bei, they could be selling counterfeit Apple products for as low as 10% of the selling price of the original Apple product[^43].

## G.   The Defence Case

31     The Defence accepted that the Goods seized were in the possession of the Accused for the purposes of trade[^44].

32     However, the Accused is saying that the Goods seized were not counterfeit goods by reason of the Accused’s supplier’s assurance that the Goods were made by the original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”)[^45]. In the alternative, even if the Goods are counterfeit, the Accused is saying, as a prudent businessman, he is not liable under Section 49(c) of the Trade Marks Act because he had “taken all reasonable precautions” and had “no reason to suspect the genuineness of the mark”[^46].

33     The Defence had relied on the sole testimony of the Accused and they had also tendered a total of 15 exhibits in support of their case.

## H.   The Accused’s Evidence

34     The Accused had elected to take the stand to give evidence. His evidence is as follows:

> a.     The Accused is self- employed and he deals with online distribution and sales. The Accused conducts his business mainly on online platforms such as Lazada and Shopee so there is no physical address for this distribution channels[^47].

> b.     The Accused’s business is located at Yishun Industrial Park #04-26 and the Accused uses this place mainly to store the products that he sells[^48].

> c.     The Accused’s company is called XKoo Tech and he started his online business from year end 2012 and he deals mainly with handphone accessories such as charging cables, ear pieces, phone batteries and power banks[^49].

> d.     The Accused imported his goods from China, Hong Kong and Korea. When he first started his business, he would find his suppliers through found his suppliers through online means or go to Hua Qiang Bei[^50].

> e.     In deciding which supplier to order from, the Accused would base his decision on the type and variety of products sold by the supplier. With regard to Apple products, the Accused will check with the supplier as to how many Apple products that the supplier is carrying and he will typically chose suppliers who sold a large variety of products including old and new models of products[^51].

> f.     For this case, the Accused had purchased Apple products from 2 suppliers[^52].The Accused is unable to remember the name of the 1st supplier and the name of the second supplier is “Yu Xing Hang”[^53]. Yu Xing Hang operates from Hua Qiang Bei as well as Guangzhou. The Accused had previously dealt with this supplier for two years but this was with regard to Samsung products and not Apple products[^54]. In the present case, the Accused also confirmed that Yu Xing Hang was the supplier who supplied him with the seized Goods.

> g.     The Accused also tendered exhibit D1 which he claim are transcripts between himself and his supplier on the Apple products and he specifically referred me to page 3 of D1 which states “Total of 5 photographs - Apple original built-in battery” and page 4 of D1 which states “Total of 4 photographs – Iphone 7 audio adapter by legitimate distributor for sale at low price, those with real order on hand, come forward, you will definitely be satisfied with the price”[^55]. According to the Accused, the supplier had put up these photographs on the Chinese App called “Moments”. “Moments” is similar to “Facebook” where a “friend” of the account holder will be able to look into the account of the account holder. Potential buyers who are “friends” of the supplier would be able to contact the supplier to buy the goods posted from the supplier[^56].

> h.     The Accused also testified that there is no fixed way in which the Accused would place his order with the supplier. The Accused can contact the supplier by telephone, or he can use WeChat to contact the supplier. On other occasions, the Accused had also requested his friends in China to go and buy from the supplier[^57]. I also note from the Agreed Statement of Facts that “the Accused would look for suppliers from Shenzhen, China and he would fly to Shenzhen to view the wares”[^58].

> i.     As for paperwork relating to sale and purchase between the Accused and his supplier, the Accused did not require any delivery order or invoices as “invoices issued by China has got no relevance in Singapore”[^59].

> j.     As for payment to the supplier, the Accused would pay the supplier in RMB. Sometimes, the Accused would pay the supplier by transferring money from his RMB account to the supplier and on other occasions, he will ask his friends to pay the supplier on his behalf. The Accused also said that he has records of the fund transfers[^60] but I noticed that there was no evidence tendered in court to support this allegation.

> k.     On the issues of determining the genuineness of the Goods, the Accused’s position is that it is not necessary to test the products supplied by the current supplier because “I do not constantly think about whether these products are genuine or fake. I also do not have the relevant knowledge to differentiate. That is why I do not see there is a need to test the products”[^61].

> l.     As for the selling price of the Goods, the Accused’s intention was to sell the Goods at a profit margin of 10 to 15% of the price he paid for the Goods because “if I were to sell it at too low a price, I will not find it meaningful”[^62]. The Accused will decide on the sale price of the Goods by referring to other online sellers such as Lazada, Shopee, Carousell, Qoo10 and either matching their selling price or with a slight markdown[^63]. The Accused had also created a document which contained both the cost price and the selling price of the Apple products which he had stored in his laptop This document was tendered and marked D12[^64]. A breakdown of the cost price and selling price of the Apple products that the Accused was selling can be seen as follows:-

> m.     The Accused did not consider Apple’s sale price when determining the price of goods sold on XKoo Tech as he was of the view that Apple makes high profit margins for all their products[^65].

> n.     On the issue of whether the Goods seized are genuine Apple products, the Accused’s position is as follows:-

>> i.       The Accused had explained to the Investigating Officer that the Goods were OEM products[^66].

>> ii.       The Accused believed that the Goods were original Apple products because his supplier had told him so[^67].

>> iii.       The Accused admitted that he did not have any documentary evidence from his supplier to show that the Apple products are genuine products but he had proof for the Samsung products that he had purchased from this supplier that the Samsung products were genuine[^68].

>> iv.       There is also no distributorship agreement between the Accused and his supplier. He also did not have any certificate of authenticity or authenticity report from his supplier to confirm that the Goods are genuine Apple products. And the reason why the Accused did not ask his supplier for any certification from Apple is because he believed that his suppliers would not be able to obtain the necessary certification from Apple or to get Apple to acknowledge the same[^69].

>> v.       The Accused also confirmed that he did not have any screenshots of WeChats or QQ Messages between his suppliers and himself confirming the Goods are genuine because the Accused does not feel there is a need to obtain such information. The Accused’s belief that the Goods are genuine is based on his long term working relationship established with his supplier[^70]. The Accused also confirmed that he did not ask to see the factories where his supplier got their Apple products from because he believed there are other suppliers higher in the supply chain[^71].

>> vi.       As regards to the Goods, for the 62 Magsafe Power Adapters and the 36 batteries, the Accused had testified he was informed by his suppliers that these 2 items were OEM products. As for the rest of the Goods, he cannot remember if his supplier had informed him whether these are OEM products but he **thinks** that they are genuine Apple products[^72].

>> vii.       In addition to relying on the representation of his supplier, the Accused will conduct random samplings of the products by first examining the exterior appearance of the product. The Accused will then test the quality of the product and finally the Accused will go online to read articles on how to differentiate between genuine and counterfeit products[^73].

## I.   The Defence Position Relating to PW2’s Examination Report

35     As regards to PW2’s Examination Report, the Defence had pointed out that PW2 had relied on the following identifiers in assessing and determining the genuineness of the Goods:-

> i.     The serial number of the product;

> ii.     The box packaging of the product;

> iii.     The hang tag affixed to the box packaging of the package;

> iv.     The quality of the printing of the product and/or packaging; and

> v.     The existence of a safety fuse within the product, where relevant[^74]

36     The Defence had submitted that the testimony of PW2 and the contents of her Examination Report are insufficient to prove that the Goods seized were genuine or counterfeit Apple products as the above identifiers are not determinative of genuineness and the method of assessment used by PW2 is inconsistent. As such, the Defence was of the view that I should disregard relying on the Examination Report in coming to any finding of fact that the seized Goods are genuine or counterfeit[^75].

## J.   Prosecution’s Submission on the Applicable Law**[^76]**

37     The Prosecution has submitted that the case law relating to Section 49 of the Trade Mark Act are as follows:-

> i.     In **_Public Prosecutor v Koh Peng Kiat_** **<span class="citation">\[2016\] 1 SLR 753</span>**, the Court of Appeal held at \[25\] indicated the Prosecution does not bear the burden of proving that that the primary offender had knowledge that a registered trade mark had been falsely applied to goods which form the subject matter of the charge[^77]. The Court of Appeal further held at \[48\] that in relation to section 49(i) of the TMA, the first two elements of “having taken all reasonable precautions” and “no reason to suspect the genuineness of the mark” were not independent requirements to be applied in a rigidly chronological or conditional order. Instead, they were inextricably linked as part of a single composite enquiry in which the accused’s assertion that he had no reason to suspect that the goods were falsely applied with a registered trade mark was considered against an objective assessment of the reasonableness and adequacy of the precautions that were taken by the accused from the perspective of a reasonably prudent businessman in similar circumstances.

> ii.     In determining if the defences under Section 49(i) and Section 49(ii) of the Act can be made out, the Singapore courts have considered several factors such as:

>> a.       price discrepancy between the counterfeit goods and the trade mark owner’s goods;

>> b.       the reputation of the supplier/trade counterparts who recommended the supplier;

>> c.       whether the infringer made the necessary inquiries with the supplier; and,

>> d.       whether the infringer provided information about the source of the goods.

> iii.     The relevant case law is outlined below.

> (a)      _Price discrepancy between the counterfeit goods and the trade mark owner's goods_

> iv.      ![]([2020] SGDC 0059_Image/[2020] SGDC 0059_image5.png)In **_Creative Technology Ltd v Cosmos Trade-Nology Pte Ltd and another <span class="citation">\[2003\] SGHC 188</span>_** _("_**_Creative Technology_**_")_, the defendants had purchased 5,000 Creative VIBRA sound cards from a supplier based in China. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants sold counterfeit sound cards and infringed its trade marks. The defendants relied on Section 49(ii) of the Act. Their argument was dismissed by the Judge. One factor that the High Court took into account was that the defendants had retailed the sound cards at a price three times less than the price of an original sound card sold by the plaintiffs.

> v.     In **_Tan Lay Heong_**, the respondent had been charged under Section 73 of the 1939 Act (now Section 49 of the Act), for selling counterfeit "Hunting World" goods. The respondents had purchased "Hunting World" products from Sogo, a large and reputable Japanese retail store in Singapore. The respondents sold the goods to retailers who had existing contracts with Sogo. Having sold off the goods, the respondents approached Sogo's suppliers, Brogi, to obtain more "Hunting World" goods. However, Brogi recommended to the respondents one Juni, who as they claimed was their supplier. The goods from Juni turned out to be counterfeit.

> vi.     The High Court held that the respondent could rely on Section 73(a) of the 1939 Act (now Section 49(i) of the Act). In this regard, the High Court considered that the respondent had examined the goods Sogo offered and determined that they were of a high quality. Yong CJ further observed, in _obiter_, that in certain circumstances, if the goods were of such obvious discrepant quality that any reasonable person would immediately become suspicious, it may well be the case that nothing short of inquiry with the trade mark owner suffices.

> vii.     In **_Creative Technology_**, one factor that militated against the defendants' reliance on the Section 49(ii) defence was the poor quality of the defendants’ sound cards. The defendants had received customer complaints about problems encountered with usage. In this regard, the defendants had carried out tests on the sound cards and continued to sell the goods despite knowing that the sound cards were not genuine.

> (b)      _The reputation of the supplier / trade counterparts who recommended the supplier_

> viii.     In **_Tan Lay Heong_**, it was in the respondents' favour that Sogo was an established business. Moreover, there were already existing contracts between Sogo and the retailers to whom the respondents had sold the "Hunting World" goods. These retailers were presumably experienced in the leather trade and had not expressed any suspicion about the genuineness of the goods. In addition, the respondent had the assurance of one of Sogo's managers, Maniam, who appeared to have expertise in studying genuine Hunting World products. In fact, it was Maniam who introduced Brogi as a supplier to Sogo.

> (c)      _If the infringer made the necessary inquiries with the suppliers_

> ix.     In **_Public Prosecutor v Chua Keng Fock <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGDC 134</span>_** _("_**_Chua Keng Fock_**_")_, where the Section 49(i) defence was made out, the accused had questioned his employer on the authenticity of the goods sold. Moreover, he requested for documentation and assurances on the authenticity of the goods when dealing with the suppliers. The accused had also sought reasonable assurances of the genuineness of the marks even though he was not in control over the importation of the goods.

> (d)      _If the infringer provided information on the source of the goods_

> x.     In **_Trade Facilities Pte Ltd v PP_** **<span class="citation">\[1995\] SGHC 119</span>** ("**_Trade Facilities_**"),7 the respondents were charged for selling and importing counterfeit cognac under Section 73 of the 1939 Act. The respondents claimed to have obtained their products through one Chan Ah Kow ("**Chan**"), who instructed a Japanese agent, one Higa, to source for a buyer in Japan. The High Court held that the respondents could not avail themselves to either a Section 73(a) defence or a Section 73(b) defence. In this regard, Yong CJ held that it was fatal to both defences that the respondent had failed to provide information on Chan (i.e. the source of the counterfeit goods). This would be the case even if, at the time of selling the goods, the respondent had taken all reasonable precautions and had no reason to suspect the genuineness of the mark. The High Court underscored that the element of providing information about the person from whom the defendant obtained the goods, while not indispensable for proving a Section 73(b) defence, was nonetheless of great importance. As such, the respondent's mere claim that it was Chan's agent could not be used to establish innocence when the respondent had failed to furnish information with respect to Chan.

## K.   The Prosecution’s Submission on the Evidence[^78]

#### (a)   The Examination Report together with PW2’s evidence show that the trade marks on the Goods are falsely applied.

38     The Prosecution had submitted that the Examination Report was well-reasoned and clearly displayed PW2’s familiarity and expertise with assessing the authenticity of a product. The Prosecution was also of the view that PW2 was forthright in stating instances in which she was unable to conclude whether a product was in fact a counterfeit such as the batteries. Such evidence clearly shows that PW2 was unbiased in her inspection of the Goods. The evidence adduced by the Prosecution establishes that the trade marks on the Goods could not have been applied with Apple’s consent, given that the nature and quality of the Goods do not conform at all to the standards set by Apple.

39     As for the evidence adduced by the Defence, the Prosecution was of the view that the Defence did not adduce any evidence to show that the Goods are products bearing trade marks which were applied with Apple’s consent (i.e. genuine goods).

40     The Prosecution therefore submitted that the Examination Report as well as PW2’s evidence amply establishes that the Goods are those on which trade marks registered by Apple have been falsely applied.

#### (b)   There is no evidence that the Goods are OEM products or factory overruns

41     The Prosecution noted that the Defence had suggested that the Goods could be made by OEM or are factory overruns. As a preliminary point, the Prosecution had cautioned against the Defence’s loose usage of the term ‘OEM’. The term “OEM” is not found in the Trade Mark Act.

42     In **_Singsung Pte Ltd and another v LG 26 Electronics Pte Ltd (Trading as L S Electrical Trading) and another_** **<span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 148</span> (“****_Singsung_****”)**, the High Court (albeit in the context of a civil infringement case) observed at \[13\] that the term “OEM” is not a legal term but a trade term:

> “…I pause here to note that it is helpful to determine whether these Chinese factories are original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), or original design manufacturers (“ODMs”). Whilst these are not legal terms but trade terms, and whilst the legal principles of intellectual property law do not depend on these categories, an appreciation of the factual differences between these two types of manufacturers is helpful. To be clear, I use the terms OEM and ODM in this judgment purely for convenience and expediency”.

43     The Prosecution had submitted that an OEM generally refers to a manufacturer who produces component parts for another manufacturer, who then incorporates the component parts into its products. The final products are sold under the second manufacturer’s brand name. For example, where a United States computer manufacturer orders the hard disk drives installed inside its computers from a Chinese disk manufacturer, the latter is an OEM.

44     However, the Prosecution had urged me to consider the following example: Company A designs and manufactures a product, which is sold to Company B. Company B then releases and sells the product into the market under its own brand. In this example, Company A is not an OEM, but an ODM.

45     The Prosecution was of the view that there can be many variants of the factual pattern described above, and the exact relationship between Company A and Company B will depend on the particular facts. In some cases, Company B may be permitted to request certain design alterations or modifications. In other cases, Company A may design and produce the product under its own brand. Subsequently, it may enter into an arrangement with Company B whereby Company B can apply its own brand to the product under some form of reseller arrangement.

46     As highlighted in **_Singsung_**, there are many variants of the OEM/ODM relationship. In the same vein, whether a product manufactured by an OEM is counterfeit turns on the facts of the particular case. Depending on the agreement between the trade mark owner and the OEM, a trade mark owner may not have granted permission to an OEM to create more than a specified quantity of goods such that any excess goods bearing the trade mark owner’s trade mark is therefore applied without consent of the owner (i.e. mark is falsely applied).

47     Given the Defence’s assertions that the Goods are made by OEMs and/or are factory overruns, the Defence bears the evidential burden of proving these assertions. However, the Defence has provided no information whatsoever about the manufacturer of the Goods. In cross-examination, the Accused conceded that he had no proof that the Goods were from Apple’s manufacturers[^79]. Hence, there is no basis for asserting that the Goods are products manufactured by OEMs or factory overruns.

48     In the absence of any specific factual matrix, the Prosecution is of the view that it is impossible to engage in any meaningful discussion about whether products manufactured by an OEM are counterfeit. The Prosecution is of the view that the Defence’s contention that an OEM manufactured the Goods is merely a red herring to distract this Court from the issues at hand.

49     As such, the Prosecution was of the view that the Accused had not produced any evidence to show that the Goods were OEM products or that the Goods were in any way authorised for distribution by Apple[^80].

50     Ultimately, the Prosecution was of the view that the evidence adduced by them, namely the Examination Report and PW2’s testimony, clearly establishes that the Goods are counterfeits and that Apple’s trade marks were falsely applied onto them. The Examination Report clearly states that the Apple trade marks have been affixed onto the Goods without Apple’s consent and based on PW2’s inspection, all the various indicators clearly showed that Apple did not make the Goods[^81].

#### (c)   The identity and supplier of the Good’s suppliers remains unknown

51     The Prosecution had pointed out that the Accused was the only person who sourced for goods sold by XKoo Tech. Thus, he is the best person to provide information and documents about the persons from whom he obtained the goods. Yet, when PW1 questioned the Accused about his suppliers, the Accused was unable to produce any invoices between himself and his suppliers to substantiate the identity of his suppliers[^82].

52     The Prosecution also noted that during the Defence case, the Accused had testified that he had two suppliers for Apple products at Hua Qiang Bei. The Accused was unable to remember the name of the first supplier and informed the Court that second supplier is Yu Xing Hang. Yu Xing Hang is only the name of the shop[^83]. Although the Accused claimed that he had a two-year business relationship with his suppliers, he was unable to produce evidence of any working relationship between himself and Yu Xing Hang[^84].

53     The Accused also testified that:-

> a.     He believed that neither of his suppliers had a corporate website[^85];

> b.     There was no formal contract between the Accused and his suppliers[^86];

> c.     He did not have any business registration information about his suppliers[^87]; and

> d.     He did not ask his suppliers for any invoices[^88].

54     Although the Accused produced a series of “Moments” purporting to be from his supplier in D1, there is nothing in the content of the messages which identifies the supplier.

55     In short, the Prosecution had pointed out that the Accused is only able to provide evidence about the name of a shop and its general location. The Prosecution had submitted that the Accused’s evidence is devoid of details or documents expected of a business relationship that purportedly spanned two years.

56     The Prosecution also pointed out that the Accused’s process of selecting suppliers, namely by looking at the variety and number of goods which they sold, would not have assisted to determine whether the suppliers were reputable. Indeed, given PW2’s evidence that Hua Qiang Bei is a ‘notorious black market’ for counterfeit Apple goods[^89], the Accused’s claim that the second supplier was an established reputable business[^90] cannot be unbelieved.

#### (d)   The Accused took no precautions against possessing counterfeit goods

57     The Prosecution also noted that the Accused is a seasoned businessman. The Accused started XKoo Tech in 2013 and between 2013 and 2017, he was engaged in the trade of selling mobile phone accessories and eventually, electronics. The Accused agreed that when purchasing goods, he would have to do proper checks[^91]. The Accused’s admission that he was not trained to spot counterfeit products is all the more reason for him to have ensured that he took some steps to verify the genuineness of the Goods.

58     Yet, it is evident from the Accused’s evidence that he relied largely on verbal assurances made to him by his hitherto unknown suppliers[^92].

59     The Accused was unable to provide any evidence of the purported two-year business relationship. Hence, his emphasis on the length of the business relationship between himself and his suppliers does not help him at all. Further, despite the Accused’s claim that the Goods were sourced from authorised Apple manufacturers, he was unable to produce any documentation of distribution agreements or certification of authenticity[^93]. Indeed, the Accused did not even have any screenshots of messages between him and his suppliers confirming that the Goods are genuine[^94].

60     The Accused attempted to shore up his case by explaining that he conducted ‘tests’ on products he obtained from his suppliers. These tests comprised of a visual inspection of the good against a genuine product as well as testing the functioning of the goods[^95]. Given the Accused’s own admission that he was not trained in spotting counterfeits, it is difficult to understand how the Accused’s visual inspection could have assisted him to detect counterfeit goods.

61     The Prosecution noted that the Accused eventually conceded that these tests would have only assisted him to ascertain the quality of the Goods, and not the source[^96].

62     Even then, the Prosecution is of the view that the Accused’s test could not have adequately tested for the quality of each good since the Accused only conducted random testing of the products he purchased from the suppliers[^97].

63     The Accused’s case that he saw no need to take precautions rests largely on the purported relationship between himself and his suppliers, as well as their reputation. Apart from bare assertions, there is nothing before the Court from which the relationship or the reputation of these suppliers may be inferred. Instead, the evidence shows that the Accused took no precautions to verify whether the Goods were genuine. The glaring absence of any steps taken by the Accused to verify the source of the Goods underscores the Accused’s cavalier attitude towards procuring genuine goods.

#### (e)   Red flags surrounding the price and packaging of the Goods

64     Apart from the questionable reputation of the Accused’s suppliers, the Prosecution was of the view that the low pricing and dubious packaging of the Goods should have put the Accused on alert as to the genuineness of the Goods.

65     D12 was a price list prepared by the Accused setting out the minimum price at which the Accused would have sold the Goods as well as the price that he paid to his suppliers to purchase a product. A simple comparison of the prices which the Accused sold the Goods at and Apple’s recommended retail price as set out in P52 reveals a significant disparity between the figures:

66     The Prosecution had pointed out that the differences became more pronounced when one compared the price that the Accused purchased the goods from his suppliers against Apple’s recommended retail price:

67     The Accused knew that Apple’s recommended retail price was on its website[^98]. He also admitted to knowing some of Apple’s retail pricing[^99]. Although the Accused denied having any suspicions in relation to the pricing of his supplier’s goods, the sharp differences in pricing should have put him on alert. His subsequent attempts to explain the low prices of the Goods – by claiming that he referred to the prices of other online stores – is utterly irrelevant to the issue of his supplier’s pricing.

68     Turning to the packaging of the Goods, the Accused agreed that he would expect his suppliers to send Apple goods in packaging bearing the Apple trade mark. Yet, the Accused claimed that he did not find it suspicious at all that some of the goods were delivered without such packaging and instead came in brown, unmarked boxes. According to the Accused, his supplier told him that the product did not come with the packaging boxes[^100].

69     The Prosecution had submitted that it was clear from the Accused’s testimony that he knew the unmarked packaging would raise the suspicions that the Goods were counterfeit. Yet, he simply refused to admit this and instead embarked on a confusing explanation about the need for his business to have some form of packaging[^101].

70     The Prosecution had submitted that the Accused’s response is so devoid of logic that it can only be a disingenuous attempt to downplay the fact that the absence of proper packaging aroused his own suspicions. Having seen Apple’s packaging before, the Accused must have found it suspicious that his suppliers – who claimed to be selling genuine Apple goods – sold him goods in brown, unmarked boxes. Despite that, the accused claimed that he was happy to accept the words of his supplier[^102].

#### (f)   The reputation of the Accused’s suppliers is fundamentally dubious

71     The Prosecution had noted that at the heart of the Defence’s submissions that the Accused had taken reasonable precautions against selling counterfeit products is the Accused’s claim that he had taken care to select reputable suppliers. Using this claim as a springboard, the Defence argued that the Accused could not have realised that the Goods were counterfeit as these suppliers represented that the goods they sold were genuine Apple products. The Defence had relied on the decision in **_Tan Lay Heong_**, where the defendants were acquitted of their TMA charges because they had, _inter alia_, relied on the reputation of their supplier.

72     However, the Prosecution had pointed out that the critical difference between the present case and **_Tan Lay Heong_** is the absence of any information about the reputation of the accused’s suppliers. The defendants in **_Tan Lay Heong_** had purchased the counterfeit goods from Sogo, a large retailing concern of repute whereas in the present case, the precise details of the Accused’s suppliers remains unknown. The Accused’s claim that he undertook a rigorous selection process before deciding on a supplier does not assist him at all if the goods came from a dubious source. Any subsequent attempt on the Accused’s part to conduct random sampling of the goods obtained from a dubious source could hardly change the fact that such goods are likely to be counterfeit. Ultimately, the Accused has failed to show that his suppliers are reputable business concerns and not shady enterprises.

#### (g)   The accused is an evasive witness

73     The Prosecution also submitted that throughout the course of giving evidence, the Accused had come across as an unreliable and evasive witness. There were several occasions where the Prosecution was compelled to repeat simple questions as the Accused avoided answering the question. It was also evident that the Accused attempted to second-guess the purport of the Prosecution’s questions.

74     Coupled with his illogical and inconsistent responses to the questions asked by the Prosecution, the Accused’s demeanour called into question his credibility as a witness of fact.

75     Given the above, the Prosecution was of the view that this was a case where the Accused took no precautions to determine whether the Goods were genuine Apple products. Instead, the Accused chose to rely on assurance made to him by unknown suppliers located in a notorious black market of counterfeit goods and the Prosecution urged this Court to convict the Accused of the proceeded charge.

## L.   The Defence Submission

76     The Defence had submitted[^103] that in order to make out an offence under Section 49(c) of the Trade Marks Act, it is incumbent on the Prosecution to prove the following elements of the charge beyond reasonable doubt:-

> a.     First, that the seized Goods were in the possession of the Accused for the purpose of trade; and

> b.     Second, that the trade marks applied to the seized Goods were falsely applied – and this requires an investigation as to whether the seized Goods are genuine or counterfeit.

77     The Defence also pointed out that in order to establish a defence under Section 49(c) of the Trade Marks Act, the Defence merely has to show, on a balance of probabilities, that the Accused:-

> a.     had taken all reasonable precautions against committing an offence under Section 49(c) of the Trade Marks Act and at the time of the alleged offence, the Accused had no reason to suspect the genuineness of the mark; and

> b.     on demand by or behalf of the Prosecution, the Accused gave all the information in his power with respect to the persons from whom he obtained the Goods.

78     Alternatively, the Defence merely has to show, on a balance of probabilities, that the Accused acted innocently against committing an offence under Section 49 (c) – ie that the Accused acted innocently against an offence of possessing counterfeit goods.

## M.   The Defence on the Issues before the Court

79     Given the above, the Defence is of the view that the issues before the Court for the present case are as follows[^104] :-

> (a)     Whether the Goods were in the Accused’s possession for the purpose of trade or manufacture?

> (b)     Whether the Goods seized, which have been characterised as OEM by the Accused, are to be considered as counterfeit in nature?

> (c)     Whether the contents of the Examination Report and PW2’s testimony sufficient to prove that the Goods are genuine or counterfeit?

> (d)     Whether it can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Apple trademarks were falsely applied to the Goods seized?

> (e)     Whether the Accused had taken all reasonable precautions against committing the alleged offence and had, at the time of the commission of the alleged offence, no reason to suspect the genuineness of the mark?

> (f)     Had the Accused, on demand made by or on behalf of the Prosecution, given all the information in his power with respect to the persons from whom he obtained the Goods?

> (g)     Alternatively and notwithstanding the issues above, whether the Accused acted innocently in the commission of the alleged offence?

## N.   The Defence’s position in relation to the above issues

#### (a)   Whether the Goods were in the Accused’s possession for the purpose of trade or manufacture

80     As regards to whether the Goods were in the Accused’s possession for the purpose of trade or manufacture, the Defence accepts that the Goods seized were in the possession of the Accused for the purposes of trade.[^105]

#### (b)   Whether the Goods, which have been characterised as OEM by the Accused, are to be considered as counterfeit in nature

81     As regards to whether the Goods, which have been characterised as OEM by the Accused, are to be considered as counterfeit in nature[^106]:-

> a.     The Defence had submitted that the focus of the inquiry here ought to be the Accused’s perception of OEM products as a reasonable prudent businessman. The Accused had clarified that he understood genuine Apple products to be of the following nature[^107]:

>> (a)       products authorised by Apple for distribution and manufacture;

>> (b)       products not authorised by Apple for distribution but authorised by Apple for manufacture (i.e. OEM products); and

>> (c)       accessories that are removed from original Apple handphone packaging.

> b.     According to the Accused, the Magsafe power adapters and the iPhone batteries are OEM products, by reason of him having been so informed by his suppliers. However, the Accused said that he was unable to ascertain whether the rest of the Goods were OEM products, as he was unable to recall whether his supplier had notified him of the source of such items. Furthermore, the rest of the Goods came with proper packaging and they could not be OEM products[^108].

> c.     Nonetheless and more importantly, the Accused maintained that the seized Goods by reason of the Accused’s supplier’s assurances on the same that the Apple products were OEM and the Accused’s understanding of OEM products as genuine:

>> “_Because I---I have trust in my supplier, I will not question him every other day about this. And I cannot understand… the reason or suspect the reason behind why he sell genuine and counterfeit products.”[^109]_

> d.     The Defence also referred me to the case of **_Public Prosecutor v Koh Peng Kiat_** <span class="citation">\[2016\] 1 SLR 753</span> (“**_Koh Peng Kiat_**”), where the Court of Appeal at \[41\], had stipulated that it is unrealistic for a businessman to make inquiries of an authorised dealer every time he is offered a supply of goods, even from a reputable source, especially when it is not always easy to discern who is an authorised distributor in the first place. Accordingly, it is sufficient for the Accused as a reasonable businessman in everyday commerce to rely on the assurances of his supplier as to the genuineness of the seized Apple products.

> e.     PW2 had also given evidence that different Apple products are manufactured by different suppliers in China, Vietnam and Japan. Specifically, she confirmed that the following types of the seized Apple products, all of which have been categorised in the Examination Report, are manufactured by different suppliers in China, such manufacturers being OEMs:

>> (a)       Magsafe Power Adapter;

>> (b)       USB-C Power Adapter;

>> (c)       12W Power Adapter;

>> (d)       5W Power Adapter;

>> (e)       USB-C Charge Cable;

>> (f)       Lightning to USB Cable;

>> (g)       Micro USB Adapter;

>> (h)       Earpods; and

>> (i)       iPhone batteries.

> f.     When it was put to PW2 as to whether it was possible that Apple’s OEMs may release Apple products via channels other than Apple’s retail stores, PW2 was _unable_ to provide an answer and merely stated that there are agreements between Apple and its suppliers that disallow such suppliers from selling Apple products without Apple’s knowledge[^110]. PW2 was further _unable_ to confirm whether Apple experienced difficulty in controlling the behaviour of Apple’s manufacturers from China and/or their immediate distributors, in terms of how OEM products enter the market[^111].

> g.     The Defence also pointed out that the Court in **_Public Prosecutor v Tan Lay Heong and another_** <span class="citation">\[1996\] 1 SLR(R) 504</span> (“**_Tan Lay Heong_**”), had at \[86\], noted that:

>> “_It is not unknown for trade mark owners to deny that goods manufactured by their licenses are authorised when confronted with parallel imports.”_

> h.     The Defence had submitted that the fact that PW2 was unable to or not in a position to comment on Apple’s OEMs, bolstered the proposition in **_Tan Lay Heong_** that genuine goods can always come from alternative sources in the global market regardless of the trade mark owner’s attempts to restrict distribution. Indeed, the Defence noted that such a proposition was endorsed most recently in 2016 where the Court of Appeal in **_Koh Peng Kiat_** agreed, at \[39\], that “_there are more parallel sources of legitimate branded goods in the global market than one can imagine_”.

> i.     The Defence therefore submitted that Apple products that are manufactured by OEM, regardless of how they are released into the market, whether through Apple-authorised distribution channels or Apple retail stores, are to be considered as genuine.

#### (c)   Whether the contents of the Examination Report and PW2’s testimony in court is sufficient to prove that the Goods seized are genuine or counterfeit

82     As regards to whether the contents of the Examination Report and PW2’s testimony in court is sufficient to prove that the Goods seized are genuine or counterfeit, the Defence’s position is as follows[^112]:

> a.     The Examination Report contained PW2’s comments to each of the 10 categories of the Goods that were seized from the Accused – specifically, the reasons as to why the products in each category are purportedly counterfeit, which in turn are premised on certain identifiers used by PW2 in assessing the genuineness of the products. These identifiers are:

>> (a)       the serial number of the product;

>> (b)       the box packaging of the product;

>> (c)       the hang tag affixed to the box packaging of the product;

>> (d)       the quality of the printing on the product and/or packaging; and

>> (e)       the existence of a safety fuse within the product, where relevant.

> b.     The Defence submitted that the contents of the Examination Report and the oral testimony of PW2 are not sufficient to prove that the Apple products seized are genuine or counterfeit, for the following reasons:-

>> i.       Identifiers are not determinative of genuineness

> c.     The Defence submitted that most of the identifiers that were mentioned in the Examination Report are not determinative or reliable indicators as to product genuineness. A closer look at PW2’s explanations during trial as to the application of these identifiers would suggest that such identifiers are either problematic in themselves, or merely go towards a superficial criticism of Apple products that cannot be conclusive as to genuineness.

> _Serial numbers_

> d.     PW2 gave evidence that Apple used a unique algorithm to assign serial numbers to every Apple product, such that “_when \[she looks\] at the serial number, \[she\] can know whether \[the serial number\] is according to algorithm_”. If a product’s serial number is not in accordance to Apple’s algorithm, said product is not one that has been manufactured by Apple[^113]. According to the Examination Report, the serial numbers on the Magsafe power adapters and on 28 iPhone batteries of the Examination Report are invalid and accordingly, she concluded that such products are counterfeit.

> e.     However, PW2 also said that just because a serial number is in accordance to Apple’s algorithm, it does not necessarily mean that a product is a genuine Apple product because counterfeiters may reproduce Apple products, copy genuine serial numbers off Apple products, and reproduce said serial numbers on the counterfeit products, such that “_just by checking the serial numbers we won’t be able to establish if it is a genuine or a counterfeit_”[^114].

> f.     It is noteworthy that the above statement by PW2 essentially highlights that there are situations where Apple itself is unable to establish whether a product is a genuine or counterfeit Apple product based on the serial number. What more can we expect from a businessman like the Accused, who lacks the necessary identifier information which would be proprietary to Apple alone? This difficulty was also pointed out by the Accused when he was questioned on the serial numbers on the 36 iPhone batteries in the Examination Report:

>> _“… Out of the 36, Apple is saying that the 28 are counterfeit. What about the remaining 8? So based on what was being assessed, the first 28s have been deter---28 batteries have been determined to be counterfeit, based on the serial numbers. But for the remaining 8---8, Apple report just mentioned that they are second-hand products, but based on my assessment, they do have serial numbers. If the 8 second-hand batteries all have serial numbers, how do they determine that the 28 are counterfeit and this 8 are secondhand products? So the---I’m questioning the conclusion that the Apple witness has made. It seems to be contradicting. How can they reach a conclusion---”[^115]_

> g.     Furthermore, the Defence was of the view that PW2’s response as to determining the validity of serial numbers was of a rather brief and perhaps even dismissive nature, since her evidence was essentially that all that needs to be done is for her to “_look at the serial number_”, following which she “_can know whether \[the serial number\] is according to algorithm_”. Indeed, when the question was put to PW2 that “_from looking at the serial numbers it quite clear that it’s counterfeit, right?_”, PW2 candidly answered in the affirmative[^116] – thus confirming a second time the brevity of her response. The Defence took this opportunity to compare the brevity of PW2’s response with the evidence proffered by the representative for Samsung during the Samsung trial as to invalid serial numbers:

>   
| 

_“Court:_

 | 

_When---when you says invalid serial number, what do you really---what do you mean?_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_Uh, there are serial number on the indicated on the battery itself. So from the serial number we can recognise which production, deal with production plan this battery was specifically made in, but when we countercheck with our list, it’s not valid.”_ [^117]

 |

  
  

> h.     While the Defence recognised that different companies have different internal policies and methods of assessing product genuineness, the point that the Defence wished to make is that PW2’s evidence as to something (i.e. the algorithm) that is seemingly significant to assessing the validity of serial numbers for the purposes of determining product genuineness is too simplistic. The fact that PW2 was unable to, could not or refused to provide more informative evidence on the processes that Apple undertakes in assessing product genuineness based on algorithms and serial numbers suggests a possibility that serial numbers are not that significant as to determining product genuineness.

> i.     Accordingly, the Defence took the view, on an objective basis, that it is questionable whether it would be apt for any person to rely on serial numbers as an identifier of product genuineness.

> _Box Packaging_

> j.     Next, the Defence noted that according to PW2, Apple packages their products in white boxes with the Apple logo and product description, where the box is cellophane-wrapped and sealed[^118].PW2 also said that box packaging would be counterfeit if the boxes are “_a very clear brown box_”[^119]. Accordingly, it was partly on this basis of brown box packaging that the Magsafe power adapters were regarded as counterfeit.

> k.     However, the Defence was of the view that ‘counterfeit’ packaging in the form of brown boxes cannot be equated to counterfeit products. This is by reason of the fact that packaging and products are two entirely different things and concepts.

> l.     Even between ‘counterfeit’ brown box packaging and ‘genuine’ white box packaging there is a distinction, particularly for online sellers. The Accused’s evidence illustrates this distinction:

>> _“… What you refer as packing box is known as retail packaging. This brown box that we see here is just call packaging. We are a online seller, we sell our products online. For this---for products without packaging boxes, we need to first find a place to store these products to---to send the products to customer, we also need to have a packaging. This is my explanation.”_ [^120]

> m.     Separately, the Defence was of the view that despite PW2’s definitive statements as to genuine white box Apple packaging as mentioned above, there were certain aspects of PW2’s evidence that would suggest that PW2 was not actually certain as to what constitutes genuine box packaging. For example, when questioned about the packaging of the USB-C adapters in the Examination Report, PW2 noted that while the packaging of the items was in accordance with Apple’s old style packaging, she “_wasn’t able to determine if it is a packaging that was from Apple or not_”[^121], because to her, the printing on the box packaging was similar, even identical, to that of Apple’s packaging[^122].

> n.     In light of PW2’s evidence above, the Defence submitted that the box packaging identifier is useful only insofar as it goes to show that there were some differences in the outward packaging of the seized Apple products. Accordingly, this identifier is merely superficial in nature and cannot possibly be regarded as an indicator, much less a definitive one, as to product genuineness.

> _Hangtags_

> o.     On the issue of relying on hangtags as an identifier, the Defence noted that PW2’s evidence as regards hangtags was that Apple’s hangtag is mostly neatly and securely fastened onto Apple’s box packaging[^123] as a “_whole piece_”[^124]. In relation to the seized Goods, she noticed that a lot of the hangtags were attached to the product packaging in an inconsistent manner[^125], whereby the size of the paper that supports the hangtag varied across different packaging[^126]. An example was the Earpods in the Examination Report, where PW2 noted that the hangtag was affixed atop its box packaging, which was different from Apple’s style of affixing the hangtag at the side of the box packaging where the seal could be found[^127].

> p.     Similar to the issue of the box packaging above, the Defence was of the view that the hangtag identifier only goes to show that there were some differences in the outward packaging of the seized Goods. The hangtag identifier is merely superficial in nature, and cannot possibly be regarded as an indicator, much less a definitive one, as to product genuineness.

> _Print quality_

> q.     The issue of bad print quality arises from PW2’s evidence that the printing on some of the seized Goods were different from that of Apple’s usual style of printing. According to PW2, Apple has a special way of colouring in the words that are printed on the products, where the general printing standard is such that “_the words will be outlined_” and “_we would colour in the actual words using different patterns_”[^128]. Thus, according to PW2, bad print quality, which would deem a product counterfeit, is where the colouring of the words that are printed on some of the seized Goods are not in accordance with how Apple would colour in the words[^129].

> r.     With respect to PW2’s evidence, the Defence submitted that the above conclusion can only be reached after (a) a person has special knowledge of what the colouring of the words should actually be, and (b) that person then conducts a special visual examination of the printing on the products. To illustrate this point, the Defence noted that PW2 that her observations as to bad print quality on the items in category 3 of the Report were derived after having used a microscopic camera to produce an enlarged view of the printing on said products[^130]. In this regard, it was pointed out by the Accused that objectively, any image that is enlarged from the original item will be distorted or unclear[^131]. The Accused also testified that given that the font sizes of the printing are generally so small, such printing is not clearly visible to the eye, and it cannot be said that printing is of bad quality[^132].

> s.     Just like the issues of box packaging and hangtags above, the Defence was of the view that the print quality identifier merely shows that there were some differences and/or deficiencies in printing on the seized Apple products, such differences and/or deficiencies clearly not obvious to the general public or reasonably prudent businessman without special inside knowledge and the aid of a microscopic camera. Accordingly, the print quality identifier is merely superficial in nature, and cannot possibly be regarded as an indicator, much less a definitive one, as to product genuineness.

>> ii.       Inconsistent methods of assessment as to genuineness

> t.     The Defence was of the view that one of the particularly troubling aspects of the Prosecution’s evidence was that there was absolutely no consistency in the methods used by the Prosecution’s witnesses to work together to assess and determine the genuineness of the seized Goods.

> u.     When PW2 was questioned, in her capacity as the person who inspected the seized Goods and the maker of the Examination Report, as to how she inspected the said products, PW2’s response was as follows:

>> “_Um, the Investigating Officer would, uh, show me the products, um, and the different boxes and I will group them according to the different product category and in each product I will open up, uh_, **_if it’s in the packaging, I will look at the packaging, take photos of it_**_, open up the product, look at the product itself. Um_, **_certain points I will then look at the product, if there’s a serial number or there’s printing and I will look at it, um, closer, um, retrieve the information_** _and then, um, category---cat---put it according to the different product category and then I’ll---that’s how I do the inspection.”[^133]_

>> (Emphasis Defence)

> v.     The Defence was of the view that PW2’s response did not reveal a clear method by which the seized Goods were inspected. Rather, her response reflected that she was somewhat selective in her methods, by, for example, only looking at the products at “_certain points_” and only looking at the packaging of the products “_if \[the products are\] in the packaging_”.

> w.     The Defence felt that such selectivity in how evidence was given to the Court is illustrated clearly in the contents of the Examination Report itself, where each category of products has been deemed counterfeit by reference to identifiers that differ from category to category. For example:

>> (a)       The Magsafe power adapters in category 1 of the Examination Report are said to be counterfeit because the serial numbers on the products are invalid, and the packaging of the products are not Apple’s original packaging[^134] – on this point of packaging, PW2 explained that it was because the products were contained in boxes that are different from Apple’s usual white box packaging[^135].

>> (b)       On the other hand, the USB-C power adapters in category 2 of the Examination Report are said to be counterfeit because there was no safety fuse in any of the plugs[^136].

>> (c)       Then, the 12-watt USB power adapters in category 3 of the Examination Report, are said to be counterfeit because the printing on the products is of bad quality that is different from Apple’s printing, and as the print quality is bad, the packaging of the product is counterfeit[^137] - on this point of print quality, PW2 explained that it was because the words were coloured in a different way from how Apple would colour in the words[^138].

> x.     Given that there is no consistency, or even any discernible structure, as to how the seized Goods have been assessed for non-genuineness, the Defence submitted that the Examination Report was entirely self-serving as it had been prepared on the basis of PW2’s application and/or reliance on a selected identifier (or identifiers) to determine that each category of products seized are counterfeit.

> y.     In the circumstances, the Defence had submitted that it would not be prudent for this Court to rely on the contents of the Examination Report, as the contents of the Examination Report suggest that the seized Goods have not been assessed properly for the purposes of providing a holistic explanation to assist the Court in determining whether the products are indeed genuine or counterfeit.

>> iii.       Omission of information

> z.     While PW2 has sought to elaborate upon the contents of the Examination Report during trial, her oral testimony reveals several issues that were noted about the seized Goods but were not mentioned in the Examination Report, or even if mentioned, were not further elaborated upon for clarity. The examples raised by the Defence are as follows:-

>> i.       In relation to the USB-C power adapters in category 2 of the Examination Report, when questioned as to whether she had examined the packaging of said seized Goods, PW2 candidly answered in the affirmative and stated that the packaging was “_done in the old style packaging with the Apple logo that is in the grey form_”, and that she was unable to determine if the box packaging was that of Apple’s, because the printing on the box looked similar to Apple’s, “_even identical_”[^139]. Notably, this observation as to packaging was not referred to in the Examination Report at all.

>> ii.       In relation to the 12-watt USB power adapters in category 3 of the Examination Report, PW2’s evidence as to the printing of the packaging in which the said seized Goods were contained was that she found the printing on the boxes to be “_almost identical to \[Apple’s… old style packaging\]_”[^140].

>> iii.       It is significant to note that this evidence is completely at odds with the observations in the Examination Report that the “_packaging of the product is counterfeit as the print quality is bad_”[^141] – an observation that printing is almost identical to that of earlier packaging is not the same as, and should not be confused with, an assertion as to bad print quality for the purposes of determining whether the products are counterfeit.

>> iv.       In relation to the iPhone batteries in category 10 of the Examination Report, in particular the eight batteries stated to be “_inconclusive_”, it was only upon being questioned as to what this meant, that PW2 revealed that the serial numbers found on said eight batteries were valid[^142]. The Defence was of the view that this is extremely significant, because PW2’s evidence as regards serial numbers, coupled with the overall contents in the Examination Report, had all along been that if the serial numbers are invalid, the products are counterfeit[^143]. It is noteworthy that, despite the significance of the observation as to valid serial numbers, this observation was completely not mentioned in the Examination Report at all.

>> v.       Rather, instead of explicitly stating that the serial numbers are valid, the Examination Report attempts to subsume the issue of inconclusiveness within the broader statement that the said eight batteries are “_suspected to be second-hand used batteries_”[^144]. Then, on the issue of second-hand used batteries, PW2 admitted the possibility as to the genuineness of such batteries[^145] given the chance that Apple consumers may have removed such batteries from their phones[^146] and put up the same for sale in the market[^147].

>> vi.       The Defence also pointed out while it is noted that PW2 sought to clarify that valid serial numbers may not necessarily mean that the corresponding product is genuine, since counterfeiters may reproduce Apple products, copy genuine serial numbers off Apple products, and reproduce said serial numbers on the counterfeit products[^148], the point that the Defence wished to make is that there _is_ a possibility that the eight batteries are genuine – however, this possibility has not been mentioned in the Examination Report at all.

>>> aa.       The Defence was of the view that various instances identified above serve to show that the Examination Report is inherently not credible and internally inconsistent, as:

>>>> (a)       certain observations which would go towards possibly invalidating an assertion that the seized Goods are counterfeit (because of valid serial numbers, for example), or at the very least, raising a fair and reasonable point that some identifiers (for example, packaging) are not determinative as to whether the products are counterfeit, are clearly not stated in the Examination Report; and

>>>> (b)       there appears to be a disconnect between the nature of the observations that were stated in the Report and what was actually observed during inspection of the seized Goods.

>>> bb.       The Defence also raised the issue of not being allowed to cross-examine PW2 as the maker of the Examination Report. I will deal with this issue later on in my judgment.

>>> cc.       Having considered the matters in paragraphs above, the Defence was of the view that the Examination Report and PW2’s evidence are not sufficient to prove that the Goods seized are genuine or counterfeit. While the Examination Report was prepared by PW2, particularly in her capacity as the Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Manager at Apple for Southeast Asia Pacific, the contents of the Examination Report do not reflect PW2’s expertise in intellectual property and/or contain information that would lead to an incontrovertible finding that the seized Goods are counterfeit. If the Examination Report is to truly be sufficient as to proving product genuineness, then the Defence was of the view that more specific content is required – for example, published manufacturer specifications (whether publicly or privately available), laboratory equipment test results, figures, graphs, statistics, calculations, written explanations etc.

>>> dd.       The Defence was of the view that the Examination Report, with its brevity of information, attempted to pick on superficial aspects of the seized Goods such as the box packaging, hangtag and quality of the printing in its complaint that the said products are counterfeit, and seeks to rely on seemingly reliable identifiers such as serial numbers that turn out to be inherently problematic themselves. Given the manner of preparation and substance of the Examination Report, the Defence was of the view that it is not possible for this Court to convict the Accused based on the contents of the Examination Report. Further, the cumulative effect of the inconsistencies in product assessment and omission of certain relevant information/observations from the Examination Report show that the Examination Report, its brevity aside, may not have been carefully or properly prepared.

>>> ee.       Accordingly, the Defence submitted that it would be unsafe for this Court to rely on the Examination Report in coming to a finding that the seized Goods are genuine or counterfeit.

#### (d)   Whether it can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Apple trademarks were falsely applied to the Goods seized

83     On the issue of whether it can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Apple trademarks were falsely applied to the Goods seized, in view of paragraphs 81 and 82 above, the Defence submitted that it could not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Apple trademarks were falsely applied to the Goods seized[^149], as:

> (a)     given PW2’s admission that all of the Goods seized are manufactured by OEMs, and the fact that she was unable to provide information as to the behaviour of Apple’s OEMs in terms of how OEM products enter the market, it is possible to say that Apple products that are manufactured by OEM, regardless of how they are released into the market, whether through Apple-authorised distribution channels or Apple retail stores, are to be considered as genuine; and

> (b)     most significantly, the Examination Report, which is the crux of the Apple Charge, is inherently problematic and consequently is not sufficient to prove that the Apple products seized are genuine or counterfeit.

#### (e)   Whether the Accused had taken all reasonable precautions against committing the alleged offence

84     The Defence had also contended that the Accused had taken all reasonable precautions against committing the alleged offence and had, at the time of the commission of the alleged offence, no reason to suspect the genuineness of the mark.

85     The Defence submitted that the 2 elements of the defence proviso in Section 49(i) of the Trade Mark Act, are that the Accused had “_taken all reasonable precautions_” and had “_no reason to suspect the genuineness of the mark_”. In this regard, the Court of Appeal in **_Koh Peng Kiat_** has helpfully clarified the operation of these elements, at \[47\]:

> “… _the first two elements of “having taken all reasonable precautions” and “no reason to suspect the genuineness of the mark” in s 49(i) of the TMA are not independent requirements to be applied in a rigidly chronological or conditional order. Instead, they are_ **_inextricably linked as part of a single composite enquiry_** _in which the accused’s assertion that he had no reason to suspect that the goods were falsely applied with a registered trade mark is_ **_considered against an objective assessment of the reasonableness and adequacy of the precautions that were taken by the accused from the perspective of a reasonably prudent in similar circumstances._**_”_

> (emphasis Defence)

86     In determining whether reasonable and adequate precautions were taken, the Defence submitted that two key questions would have to be considered by this Court[^150]:

> (a)     first, what were the steps taken by the Accused in ordering the products from his suppliers; and

> (b)     second, whether there was anything about the said products that could have alerted the Accused as to the possibility that the products may not be genuine, such that the Accused could have considered taking further steps to verify the genuineness of the products at anypoint in time.

87     The Defence also submitted[^151] that according to **_Koh Peng Kiat_**, It is imperative that the questions above be considered objectively and from the perspective of a reasonably prudent businessman in similar circumstances as the Accused.

88     The Defence was of the view that, in the overall circumstances and objectively, the Accused as a businessman had taken reasonable and adequate precautions in verifying the genuineness of the seized Goods, and accordingly had no reason to suspect the genuineness of the mark which was applied on such products[^152]:-

> a.     The Accused had exercised prudence in selecting his suppliers for the provision of goods:-

>> i.       The Accused generally obtained his Apple products from two suppliers that operate out of Hua Qiang Bei[^153]. In recognition of the fact that Hua Qiang Bei houses a number of suppliers, the Accused explained that he adopted the following 3-step process in selecting his suppliers for the provision of goods[^154]:

>>> (a)       first, the Accused would look at the types of products offered by the supplier;

>>> (b)       second, the Accused would consider whether he had a working relationship history with the supplier; and

>>> (c)       third, the Accused would request for sample products from the supplier for testing.

>> ii.       Further to the aforesaid 3-step process, in selecting his suppliers, the Accused also considered other factors such as the number of products sold and the state of the products sold by the suppliers. This was because, in the Accused’s view:

>>> (a)       if a supplier only sells one to two types of products, the chances of these products being counterfeit are heightened[^155]; and

>>> (b)       if a supplier carries both new and old product models, there is a lower probability that said supplier will manufacture or sell counterfeit products. On the contrary, suppliers who set out to sell counterfeit products will usually only sell newer product models in order to gain higher sales and profits[^156].

>> iii.       Importantly, the Accused pointed out that if there was a problem with one or two products which were supplied to him by a supplier, he would stop working with the said supplier[^157].

>> iv.       The Defence submitted that the evidence referred to above showed that the Accused did not take a lackadaisical attitude in sourcing for goods. Rather, by employing a selection process for potential suppliers and keeping various considerations as to products in mind, the Accused had exercised prudence in selecting his suppliers, such prudent selection being a reasonable precaution to eliminate, or at the very least reduce, his risks in trading with suppliers who might potentially sell and supply him with counterfeit products.

> b.     The Accused had tested samples of the goods before placing an order with his supplier:-

>> i.       As regards to the Accused’s testing of the sample products provided by suppliers, the Accused explained he usually carried out such testing from the position of a consumer, the steps being[^158]:

>>> (a)       first, observing the exterior appearance of the products;

>>> (b)       second, experiencing the usage of the products from a user point of view, for example:

>>>> (i)       by plugging an Apple data cable into an electronic device to check whether it was secure and that there were sufficient contact points[^159]; or

>>>> (ii)     by checking that an electronic device was indeed charging when a charging cable was plugged in[^160];

>>> (c)       third, reading online articles that provided guidance on the ways to differentiate between genuine and counterfeit products.

>> ii.       While an argument might be made that the aforesaid testing methods only go towards establishing the quality of a product and not whether the product is genuine or counterfeit, it is important to consider the relevance of the said testing methods from the _perspective_ of the Accused as a businessperson. According to the Accused, counterfeit goods are generally of bad quality, as the motive of producing counterfeit products is correlated to the generation of profits[^161]. It would go against the grain of the motive to produce counterfeit products if such products were of good quality, since good quality products would necessitate higher costs, which would in turn lower the profit margins[^162].

>> iii.       In any event, it was the Accused’s evidence that he was not an expert in differentiating between genuine and counterfeit products, and any conclusion on the same would be based on his own perspective towards the goods[^163].

>> iv.       In light of the fact that the Accused clearly lacked the ability or knowledge to discern between genuine and counterfeit goods, the Defence submitted that the Accused’s product testing methods, while rudimentary, were reasonable and fair given that the approach with which the Accused could test such electronic products could only be that of the ordinary consumer and, perhaps, businessman who has not “_dealt with Apple products for that many years_”[^164]. In fact, on the account that the Accused considered the issue of quality testing against factors such as cost price and profit margins, the Accused had conducted himself as a reasonable prudent businessman should in ascertaining the quality of the products which he intended to sell.

> c.     The nature of the working relationship between the Accused and his suppliers:-

>> i.       The Accused testified that he obtained his supply of Apple products from two suppliers – one being ‘Yu Xing Hang’, and the other whose name the Accused was unable to recall[^165]. However, the Accused clarified that the seized Apple products that were seized were supplied by Yu Xing Hang[^166].

>> ii.       According to the Accused, his business relationship with Yu Xing Hang was originally for the supply of products bearing the brands of Samsung, BEATS, Huawei and Jabra[^167]. As regards the Samsung products in particular, Yu Xing Hang had assured and provided evidence to the Accused that the products were genuine[^168]. The Accused also observed that the Samsung products were consistently of good quality, and there were no customer complaints as regards the quality of the products[^169]. It was thus on this basis that the Accused decided to have Yu Xing Hang supply him with Apple products[^170]:

>>> _“This is because I have worked with these suppliers for more than 2 years and when I got the Samsung products from them, they told me these are the genuine products. Subsequently, I saw Apple and BEATS products and this supplier told me that all the products are genuine and therefore I did not suspect this supplier. Most importantly, I did not hear from the mouth of this supplier that they are selling counterfeit products and therefore I have no reason to suspect the supplier.”[^171]_

>> iii.       The Accused also confirmed multiple times that there was no reason for him to suspect the veracity of his supplier’s representations that the Apple products were genuine[^172].

>> iv.       The Defence also referred me to the case of **_Tan Lay Heong_** where the High Court at \[77\]-\[78\], had noted:

>>> “_A reasonable balance must be struck between the rights of the trade mark owner and the practical commercial reality that a retailer or distributor faces._

>>> _…_

>>> **_The fact remains that in everyday commerce, reasonable businessmen rely on the assurances of their trading counterparts_**”.

>>> (emphasis Defence)

>> v.       Accordingly, the Defence submitted that it was perfectly reasonable for the Accused to rely on and believe in his supplier’s statements that the Apple goods were genuine, or at the very least not suspect whether said goods were counterfeit[^173]. This is because, from a commercial point of view, it would not make sense to question the validity of a business partner’s statements especially in light of the fact that said business partner had consistently been supplying genuine goods to the Accused, albeit in respect of products from other brands, for example, BEATS, Samsung, Huawei and Jabra.

>> vi.       Given that Yu Xing Hang had consistently provided the Accused with genuine goods of good quality, albeit of different brands, the Defence submitted that it would be natural for the Accused as a businessperson to expect that the same supplier would continue to provide products that were genuine and of good quality[^174].

>> vii.       In light of the nature of the working relationship between the Accused and his supplier as explored above, it would have been open to the Accused to simply rely on his supplier’s assurances that the goods were genuine for the purposes of carrying on his business. However, the Accused gave evidence to the effect that, apart from relying on the verbal assurances of his supplier, he also viewed samples of the supplier’s products[^175] and tested the same before placing orders for said products.

>> viii.       Going back to the issue of product testing, the Defence submitted that the fact that the Accused found it necessary to conduct tests on the Apple product samples before placing orders for such products, in spite of how the Accused’s supplier had been consistently providing him with genuine goods (albeit of other brands), is significant in establishing that such product testing is a reasonable and adequate precaution taken by the Accused to eliminate or at the very least reduce the likelihood of acquiring counterfeit products and thereby committing an offence for possession of the same.

> d.     The Defence took the view that there was nothing about the prices at which the Accused obtained the products from his suppliers, or the official recommended retail prices of products, that put the Accused on notice as to the possibility of counterfeit goods :-

>> i.       The Defence noted that the Prosecution had attempted to advance a theory against the Accused that, given the Accused obtained the Apple products from his supplier at “_significantly lower_” prices than that of Apple’s recommended retail price for the same, the Accused should have been placed on suspicion as to the possibility of counterfeit goods[^176].

>> ii.       To that end, the Prosecution took the Accused through the Accused’s inventory and price list[^177], which sets out the fixed wholesale price or the minimum price at which the Accused sold each type of Apple product obtained from his supplier[^178] and the average cost price at which the Accused purchased each type of Apple product from his supplier[^179], as well as Apple’s recommended retail price list in respect of the seized Goods[^180], and concluded that:

>>> (a)       the price at which the Accused obtained the Apple products from his supplier was lower than that of Apple’s recommended retail price[^181]; and

>>> (b)       the Accused sold Apple products to his customers at a price that was lower than that of Apple’s recommended retail price[^182].

>> iii.       However, while the Accused agreed that “_my price is lower than the recommended retail price of Apple_”[^183] and said that he was aware of the availability of Apple’s recommended retail price on Apple’s website[^184], the Accused also explained that there was no reason for him to suspect that something was amiss with the Apple products obtained from his supplier simply by reason of pricing:

>>> _“Nobody compares whole prices with retail prices, therefore---therefore, I do not suspect. And from my \[perspective\], Apple company goes for high profit margin. So, any prices that is how cheap, I can also believe_.”_[^185]_

>> iv.       The Defence submitted that the Accused’s position was eminently sensible and not inherently incredible from a businessperson’s point of view. The Defence submitted that it was unreasonable for the Prosecution to say that the Accused should have been put on notice that the Apple products may be counterfeit simply because the cost at which the Accused obtained such products were lower than the official recommended retail pricing. This is because wholesale pricing and retail pricing are bound to vary, especially since retail pricing is very much dependent on other factors such as, for example, overheads and expected profit margins, such factors being particularly significant for a large multinational corporation like Apple.

>> v.       While the Prosecution attempted to advance a second theory that the Accused priced his Apple products at a price lower than that of Apple’s recommended retail pricing because the Accused suspected that his supplier was supplying him counterfeit products, the Accused’s position was abundantly clear in this regard:

>>> _“No._

>>> _…_

>>> _This is because, I will only earn the profit that I think---that I think is reasonable. I have no access to any channel of information that I cannot price my products at a price lower than Apple’s recommended retail price. If I can sell my products at a cheap price, consumers can save money and I can make a profit, then why not? Underlying condition, I think that the product is genuine.”_ [^186]

>> vi.       The Defence submitted that just because the Accused’s pricing of the Goods is at a much lower markdown than that of Apple’s recommended retail price, that does not imply that his products were not genuine, since other retailers of Apple products, such as Amazon, sell Apple products at a price lower than that of Apple’s retail price[^187]. In this regard, the screenshots reflecting Amazon’s selling price of Apple products (albeit in 2019)[^188] show that it is commonplace for online retailers or distributors to offer Apple products for sale at a price lower than that of Apple’s retail price.

>> vii.       In any event, the Accused priced his Apple products by aligning his prices to that offered by other online retailers/distributors such as Lazada, Shopee, Carousell and Qoo10, or otherwise at a price one to two percent lower than that offered by said online retailers/distributors[^189]. The Accused also said that he would decide against selling certain products if the selling price offered by such online retailers/distributors for the same products was such that the Accused would not be able to achieve his intended profit margin, taking into consideration the price at which the Accused obtained products from his supplier[^190].

>> viii.       The Defence also pointed out that PW2 herself had testified that Apple does not govern the price at which Apple’s resellers sell Apple products, nor publish or reveal the pricing at which it sells Apple products to its retailers[^191]. What this means is, there is no official guide or standard by which businesspeople who intend to sell Apple products, such as the Accused, have to adhere to for the purpose of fixing the selling prices of their Apple products, or even refer to for the purpose of considering whether or not there is anything about the cost price at which they obtained their Apple products which would suggest that said products are counterfeit.

>> ix.       In light of the above, the Defence submitted that while the Accused’s pricing strategies are correlated to the price at which he obtained the products from his supplier, it is ultimately irrelevant that the Accused ultimately priced his products lower than that of Apple’s retail price, given that a variance in selling price is extremely commonplace in the retail or distribution industry of electronic products online and offline. Any consideration of Apple’s retail price is also wholly irrelevant, as each retailer or distributor has the discretion to structure their pricing systems according to their targeted profit margins.

>> x.       Accordingly, the Defence was of the view that there was nothing about the prices at which the Accused obtained the Goods from his supplier, or the official recommended retail prices of such products, that could have put the Accused on notice or aroused suspicion as to the possibility of counterfeit goods such that the Accused ought to have taken further steps to verify the genuineness of the products.

> e.     The Defence also submitted that there were no specific aspects about the seized Goods that could have put the Accused on notice as to the possibility of counterfeit goods:-

>> i.       With reference to the Examination Report, the Defence submitted that if, according to Apple, the five identifiers of serial number, box packaging, hangtag, print quality and safety fuse are so significant as to alert a reasonably prudent businessman towards product genuineness (or its lack thereof), then a necessary follow-up question would be whether the Accused had, after receiving the Goods from his supplier, noticed anything about the products as regards these identifiers which could have alerted him to the possibility that the goods may be counterfeit.

>> ii.       In this regard, the Defence submitted that there were no specific aspects about the seized Goods that could have put the Accused on notice as to the possibility of counterfeit goods, for the reasons set out below:

>> _Serial numbers_

>>> a.       It is essential to note that, in relation to the algorithm used by Apple in assigning serial numbers and determining their validity, PW2 testified that a person who does not know of the algorithm would not be able to discern whether a serial number is genuine or counterfeit, such that it would be possible for a person to buy a counterfeit item but think that the item is genuine[^192]. This aspect of PW2’s evidence should not be ignored.

>>> b.       The Accused had expressed multiple times during trial that he did not think there was any issue with serial numbers[^193], and in particular strongly expressed his confusion in relation to how 28 out of the 36 iPhone batteries in category 10 of the Report were regarded as counterfeit based on serial numbers whereas the remaining eight batteries were regarded as secondhand products that may not be counterfeit[^194]. In relation to the batteries, the Accused’s evidence was that he did not observe any feature of said batteries that would have caused him to suspect that there was a possibility for the products to be counterfeit[^195], since such batteries are OEM products[^196] which the Accused believed to be genuine on the basis of his supplier’s assurances.

>>> c.       What the above reflected was that insofar as the Accused’s state of mind as to serial numbers was concerned, the Accused never thought that there was anything particular about the serial numbers on the products, and hence was never suspicious of the same. The Defence was of the view that it would be logical for us to arrive at a conclusion that the Accused never suspected the validity of serial numbers in light of PW2’s statement above, since the Accused could only pay attention to the serial numbers on products if he was aware of the existence of such an algorithm, or at least the method by which Apple assesses serial numbers to determine product genuineness.

>>> d.       The Defence submitted that the totality of PW2’s evidence in relation to the algorithm also suggests that only Apple personnel, and possibly only those in the Intellectual Property Enforcement department (such as PW2), would be aware of the nature and operation of the algorithm and how the algorithm can be used to identify serial numbers for the purposes of determining whether a product is potentially counterfeit. Insofar as PW2 herself was concerned, her evidence was unsatisfactory as she did not produce any reference material referring to any algorithm or to any genuine serial numbers which the Court could rely on to arrive at a conclusion that the serial numbers were indeed counterfeit, or at least show that it would have been abundantly clear to the Accused that the serial numbers were counterfeit, so that he had reason to suspect the genuineness of the mark.

>>> e.       Against this context, coupled with the fact that the Accused was all along merely in the business of obtaining products from his supplier so to sell the same and achieve his intended business profit margins, the Defence submitted that the Accused, or any reasonable businessperson in the position of the Accused, would not have been aware of Apple’s algorithm and the relevance of said algorithm in assessing serial numbers and accordingly, would not have thought it necessary to consider or check the serial numbers on the Apple products supplied before selling said products.

>>> _Box packaging_

>>> f.       The Accused testified that he observed the packaging and the contents of products to ascertain whether the product is genuine or counterfeit[^197]. Most of the seized Goods came in packaging that appeared to be genuine Apple packaging in the Accused’s opinion[^198], of good quality:

>>>> (i)       for example, in relation to the items in category 7 (i.e. Lighting to Micro USB Adapters) of the Examination Report, the Accused said that _“I’m not able to see anything that’s significantly different. To me it’s a normal packaging and as such, I think that it is a genuine one.”[^199]_;

>>>> (ii)     then, in relation to the items in category 9 (i.e. the earpods) of the Examination Report, the Accused said that _“… I do not think that the packaging that I have of the product that is in my hands now is of a inferior quality. The prints are quite finely done. The quality of the box is also not using inferior quality.”[^200];_ and

>>>> (iii)    when questioned as to whether the packaging of said items were of bad quality and not of Apple’s[^201], the Accused pointed out that whether or not packaging is of good quality is “_relative_”, i.e. to be assessed on the exterior appearance of the packaging[^202].

>>> g.       The Accused’s evidence above showed that the Accused had focused mainly on the quality of the packaging. This is reasonable given the Accused’s capacity as a businessperson who would see quality of product packaging as one of the factors to be considered before acquiring items and putting up items for sale.

>>> h.       The Accused also explained that while he was aware that some products did not come in the usual white packaging that was characteristic of Apple packaging, there was no reason for him to suspect the nature of the products by reason of packaging:

>>>> (i)       in respect of the items in categories 1 and 10 (i.e. the Magsafe Power Adapters and the batteries) of the Examination Report, his supplier had informed him that such items would be supplied to him without packaging boxes[^203]. The Defence submitted that given that the Accused had operated on the basis of trust in light of the long-standing working relationship with his supplier and given that the said items are OEM products, he did not see any reason to suspect otherwise[^204];

>>>> (ii)     in respect of the items in category 1 (i.e. the Magsafe Power Adapters) of the Examination Report, that the said items were delivered in brown boxes was not indicative of anything, as the brown boxes were simply packaging for the purposes of storing products before delivery to customers[^205]; and

>>>> (iii)    in respect of the items in category 10 (i.e. the batteries) of the Examination Report, the Defence submitted that the fact that the said items did not come with packaging at all was not anything to be suspicious about, since the Accused was aware that Apple does not sell iPhone batteries in their stores[^206]. In any event, the Accused had verified that there was no issue with the batteries by comparing their exterior appearance with that of the iPhone battery from his own iPhone[^207].

>>> i.       In light of the above, the Defence contended that to the Accused, there was nothing suspicious about the box packaging, or even lack thereof, of the products. It bears repeating that box packaging as an identifier is relevant only insofar as it goes to show differences in the outward packaging of the seized Apple products. Any differences in the outward packaging of products cannot be indicative of product genuineness.

>>> _Safety fuse_

>>> j.       The Defence next turned to the Prosecution’s reliance on safety fuses as an identifier of genuineness. As demonstrated at trial, the safety fuse is only visible when an Apple power adapter is dismantled[^208]. It was the Accused’s evidence that he did not know whether or not a safety fuse existed inside Apple power adapters[^209], and that he has little experience in dealing with Apple products[^210].

>>> k.       It is thus only natural that the Accused would not have known that Apple power adapters contain safety fuses and accordingly, it would not have occurred to the Accused to go to the extent of taking apart the power adapters to check for the existence of a safety fuse for the purpose of ascertaining whether the power adapters are counterfeit.

>>> l.       Even if assuming the Accused had inspected the power adapters, the question which arises would be how the Accused would have known what to look out for in determining the genuineness of the article.

>>> _Hangtags_

>>> m.       The Accused had testified that he does not know “_what is the correct plastic hanger_” for an Apple hangtag[^211], and further said that he had never considered hangtags as a factor when he conducted tests on the products which he intended to sell[^212].

>>> n.       In light of the Accused’s statement that he has little experience in dealing with Apple products[^213], the Defence submitted that it would be reasonable to see how it would not have occurred to the Accused that there was any need to check the hangtag on the packaging of the Apple products.

>>> _Print quality_

>>> o.       From the evidence tendered, any issues as to the quality of the printing on the products can only be discovered after using a microscopic camera to enlarge the view of the printing – this was confirmed by PW2 herself[^214]. The Accused also noted that the font sizes of the printing are generally so small such that the printing is not clearly visible to the eye[^215].

>>> p.       In this respect, it is reasonable to see how the Accused would not have noticed anything about the printing on the products, since this would certainly not have been apparent to the Accused as a businessman who has little experience in dealing with Apple products, much less undertake any minute inspection of the same.

>>> q.       By reason of the above, it is clear that there were no specific aspects about the seized Goods that could have put the Accused on notice as to the possibility of counterfeit goods. Furthermore, it is to be noted that PW2 had earlier testified that Apple does not release any advisories to the public on what to look out for to determine if Apple products are counterfeit[^216] - accordingly, there was also nothing that the Accused, as a businessperson and member of the public, could have looked to for guidance as to product genuineness. The Defence therefore submitted that it was sufficient for the Accused, as a reasonable prudent businessman who did not have the expertise, access or knowledge of Apple’s identifying information, to consider the Apple products supplied to him in the way he did.

> f.     The Defence also submitted that it was not necessary for the Accused to contact Apple to determine whether the Goods were genuine or counterfeit:-

>> i.       The Defence noted that the Prosecution had put to the Accused that the Accused had not taken any steps to contact Apple to determine whether the products the Accused intended to purchase from his supplier were genuine Apple products[^217]. While the Accused candidly agreed to this, he also explained that the reason he did not do so was because he had “_tried to do it with Samsung products_”[^218] – he had contacted Samsung to request for the contact details of a Samsung distributor and to register his interest to be a direct distributor of Samsung products, but was rejected by Samsung[^219]. According to the Accused, the experience with Samsung led the Accused to conclude that he was not allowed to be a distributor of Samsung products, such that he could foresee a similar situation of being rejected by Apple as well[^220].

>> ii.       The Defence submitted that although the Accused’s response above did not directly answer the Prosecution’s question, his response clearly reflects his state of mind towards large conglomerates of electronic products at that point in time, that there was a possibility that he would be turned away by Apple if he reached out to Apple with enquiries.

>> iii.       The Defence submitted that the Accused’s state of mind was important, as the Accused had clearly approached Samsung with a view to doing business and hopefully profiting from the same. That the Accused was turned away by Samsung would have naturally influenced the Accused as to how he wanted to conduct his business in relation to the sale of his electronic products, including that of Apple.

>> iv.       Assuming that the Accused had contacted Apple, the question which arises is whether, given that the Accused would effectively be competing with Apple by bringing in parallel imports from China to Singapore, whether Apple Singapore would have reacted favourably or even allocate resources to deal with the Accused’s inquiries. In any event, the reasonableness of expecting a businessman to make enquiries with trade mark proprietors or authorised distributors was questioned by the Court in **_Tan Lay Heong_**,147 at \[84\]-\[85\]:

>>> “_But was this a reasonable requirement? If every time a businessman is offered a supply of goods, even if the offer comes from a reputable source, he has to make inquiries from the trade mark proprietor, I cannot imagine that he will stay in business for very long. Similarly, I do not see how asking the authorized distributors in Singapore would be of any assistance. One may ask simply: how is one supposed to know that the person he asks is an authorized distributor? Can he rely on the distributor’s assurance, or must he verify this from the trade mark proprietor? … The simple fact of commercial life would be that a distributor would wish to preserve its market and would be loath to tell a potential parallel importer anything_.”

>> v.       It bears repeating the nature of the working relationship the Accused had with his supplier, that is, the Accused’s supplier, Yu Xing Hang, had consistently provided the Accused with genuine goods of good quality, albeit of different brands. Naturally, this set up a precedent for a businessperson such as the Accused to expect that the _same_ supplier would continue to provide products that were genuine and of good quality. It was perfectly reasonable for the Accused to rely on and believe in his supplier’s statements that the Apple goods were genuine, or at the very least not suspect whether said goods were counterfeit[^221]. Against this commercial understanding, while the option to contact Apple was present, it was not actually necessary for the Accused to contact Apple to determine whether the Apple products in his possession were genuine or counterfeit. The Accused should hence not be faulted for not having done so at that point in time.

89     In conclusion, the Defence submitted that it had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused had taken all reasonable precautions and had no reason to suspect the genuineness of the mark on the seized Goods. This is because:

> (a)     prior to placing any orders from suppliers for the provision of goods, the Accused had exercised care in the selection of his suppliers, by employing a selection process and keeping various considerations as to products in mind, so to eliminate or at the very least reduce his risks in trading with suppliers who might potentially sell and supply him with counterfeit products;

> (b)     prior to placing an order for products, the Accused had tested samples of the products offered to ascertain the quality of the products, notwithstanding the fact that the supplier may have had been consistently providing him with genuine products (albeit of other brands);

> (c)     the circumstances were also such that there was nothing about the prices at which the Accused obtained the Apple products from his supplier or the official recommended retail prices of such products, or any specific aspects about the seized Apple products, that could have put the Accused on notice as to the possibility of counterfeit goods such that the Accused ought to have taken further steps to verify the genuineness of the products; and

> (d)     while there was an option for the Accused to contact Apple for the purposes of determining whether the Apple products provided by the Accused’s supplier are genuine or counterfeit, it was merely an option that the Accused could have considered. Given the trusted nature of the working relationship between the Accused and his supplier, the Accused was not under any obligation to actually make such enquiries of Apple.

#### (f)   Whether the Accused, on demand made by or on behalf of the Prosecution, given all the information in his power with respect to the persons from whom he obtained the goods

90     On the issue of whether the Accused, on demand made by or on behalf of the Prosecution, given all the information in his power with respect to the persons from whom he obtained the goods, the Defence submitted that **_Tan Lay Heong_** is instructive in its clarification of the operation of this third element of Section 49(i) of the Trade Mark Act. The Court in **_Tan Lay Heong_** looked at Section 73(a)[^222] of the Trade Mark Act (as it then was), and clarified the operation of the section as follows:

> _“The first thing to be noted is that s 73(a)_ **_requires the accused to give the requisite information only “on demand made by or on behalf of the prosecution”._** _This means that there must first be a demand, and if there is no demand, there is no need to give the information. Secondly, the demand must be made by or on behalf of the Prosecution. It seems to me that this implies that there must first have been a prosecution mounted against the accused under s 73 before the demand is made, for otherwise it cannot be said that the demand was made by or on behalf of the Prosecution.”_ (at \[58\])

> “_The second thing to be noted is that s 73(a) refers only to information “with respect to the persons from whom he obtained the goods or things”. It seems to me that the third element of the s 73(a) defence is grounded upon public policy. This policy dictates that a trade mark proprietor should be able to trace up the chain of supply so as to determine the origin of the offending articles. In order to achieve this aim_, **_the accused needs only to disclose all the information in his power with respect to his supplier. In my view, so long as he does this, he would have satisfied the requirement._** _Section 73(a) does not speak of any other information which may be useful to the trade mark proprietor or the Prosecution. In particular, it_ **_does not require the accused to disclose how many items he bought from his supplier, nor does it require him to disclose invoices and other documents which may prove useful to the trade mark proprietor or the Prosecution._**_”_ (at \[61\])

> (emphasis Defence)

91     In other words, an accused is only required to give the requisite information only on demand made by or on behalf of the Prosecution and if there was no demand, there was no need to give the information. Then, in order to discharge this obligation of providing information on demand, an accused need only disclose information with respect to his supplier and nothing more – the Defence submitted that this is a narrow obligation that does not mandate an accused to assist the Prosecution beyond what information the accused can provide.

92     In the present case, PW1 testified that, while a demand was made of the Accused to name his supplier and provide any invoices from his supplier, the Accused only provided the names of the Accused’s suppliers to PW1 and nothing more[^223], even though what PW1 required was invoices to “_substantiate_”[^224] the supplier.

93     However, the Accused explained that he has never had in his possession any invoices or delivery orders with his suppliers, as he does not require such documents[^225] by reason of how such documents, being issued in China, have no relevance to his business operations in Singapore[^226]. The preparation of company accounts as regards purchases would not be hindered by the lack of invoices as these would be supported by records of bank transfers between the Accused (or the Accused’s friends) and his suppliers[^227].

94     The Defence also submitted that there was evidence that further supported the Accused’s testimony that the Accused did not have any suppliers’ invoices in his possession as PW1 had testified that:-

> (a)     during the raid of the premises where the Accused operated his business, only invoices in relation to the Accused’s daily business operations were discovered; no invoices or contracts between the Accused and his suppliers could be found[^228]; and

> (b)     a subsequent forensic inspection of the Accused’s laptop that was seized during the raid only revealed invoices that pertained to the Accused’s daily business operations and nothing with respect to his suppliers[^229].

95     In any event, if it was indeed imperative that the Accused furnish suppliers’ invoices to the police, then it would be incumbent on PW1 to make sure that the Accused disclosed the same, or at least be satisfied that the Accused was un-cooperative in disclosing the same. However, PW1 said that the Accused confirmed that he did not have such suppliers’ invoices[^230]. This is consistent with the Accused’s position that he never had such invoices.

96     The Defences position is that given that the Accused never had any suppliers’ invoices in his possession, it would not have been possible for the Accused to provide the same to PW1 even though a demand had been made for the same.

97     Further, even if the Accused was in possession of such suppliers’ invoices, in light of the Court’s comments in **_Tan Lay Heong_** above, the Accused would not have been under any obligation to “_disclose invoices and other documents which may prove useful to the trade mark proprietor or the Prosecution_”. Accordingly, any failure of the Accused to disclose the same ought not render this third element of the defence in Section 49(i) of the Trade Mark Act unsatisfied. The force of the Court’s comments in **_Tan Lay Heong_** would displace the Prosecution’s position that the Accused did not “_give all the information in \[his\] power with respect to the persons from whom \[the Accused\] obtained the 198 goods_”.

98     Finally, the Defence noted that the Prosecution had put to the Accused that the Accused was, at the time of trial, still unable to provide the Court with any information with respect to the source of his suppliers[^231]. The Defence was of the view that this is not true. As explained above, the Accused had provided PW1 with the information requested by PW1 pre-trial insofar as such information pertained to the names of the Accused’s suppliers. Even during trial, the Accused furnished, to the best of his recollection, the names of his suppliers when asked[^232], and readily answered questions as to other aspects of his suppliers, such as their online presence, physical stores etc[^233].

99     The Defence also pointed out that the Accused’s subsequent response to the Prosecution’s put, that “_I may be able to find out \[supplier information\], but nobody request me to do so_”[^234], must therefore be understood in the context that the Accused had already furnished information as to his suppliers insofar as such information, such as the names of his suppliers and the location where his suppliers could be found, was within his power and recollection.

100    If the Prosecution required further information, or specific information, as to the Accused’s suppliers, then it would be incumbent on the Prosecution, or the police on behalf of the Prosecution, to request that the Accused provide the said specific information – then, if the Accused failed to do so, the Accused can be regarded as having not complied with providing information on demand. Otherwise, it would not be reasonable to expect the Accused to know exactly what information the Prosecution required and furnish such information for the purposes of compliance, given that there was a potential for such obligation to be of an indeterminate nature subject to the discretion of the Prosecution.

101    In light of the above, the Defence submitted that it had been proven, on the balance of probabilities, that the Accused had, on demand made by or on behalf of the Prosecution, given all the information in his power with respect to the persons from whom he obtained the seized Goods which are the subject of this case.

102    In the premises, the Defence submitted that a valid defence under Section 49(i) of the Trade Mark Act has been proven on a balance of probabilities.

#### (g)   Alternatively, whether the Accused acted innocently in the commission of the alleged offence?

103    The Defence submitted that the application of the innocence defence in Section 49(ii) of the Trade Mark Act was explored in **_Trade Facilities Pte Ltd and others v Public Prosecutor_** \[1995\] SGHC 119165 (“**_Trade Facilities_**”). In **_Trade Facilities_**, the Court, looking at Section 73(b) of the Trade Mark Act (as it then was), stated at \[92\]-\[93\] as follows:

> “_The s 73(b) defence is not limited to inadvertence or mistake of fact. Nevertheless, in order to prove innocence under s 73(b), it is not sufficient to just show an incomplete s 73(a) defence. However_, **_the mere fact that in order to prove a s 73(b) defence, a defendant has to rely on facts which are also elements of a s 73(a) defence, is not by itself a sufficient ground for saying that the s 73(b) defence cannot be relied on. Moreover, the mere fact that a defendant cannot establish an element of the s 73(a) defence does not mean that he cannot have acted innocently._** _It is permissible in certain circumstances to point to other additional facts which can turn an incomplete s 73(a) defence into a s 73(b) defence. It may well be that for a case like that in_ R v S Ebata_, the fact that no precaution can be taken is sufficient to make good the failure to take all reasonable precautions, so that the incomplete s 73(a) defence is transformed into a perfected s 73(b) defence. After all, if no reasonable precaution can be taken, then all reasonable precautions in that case would mean no reasonable precaution. All of nothing is, after all, nothing. However, there is no need to decide this. Similarly, it may well be the case that the decisions in_ Stone v Burn _and_ Thwaites & Co v M’Evilly _are correct on the facts of those cases even though the reasoning cannot be wholly accepted. I express no opinion on this._ **_At the end of the day, much will depend on the facts of each individual case_**_.”_

> (emphasis Defence)

104    The force of the Court’s holding in **_Trade Facilities_** above was endorsed in 2016 in **_Koh Peng Kiat_**, where the Court of Appeal stated, at \[45\]:

> “_Counsel for the Applicant did not quarrel with the learned amicus curiae’s analysis, except that he submitted before us that an accused person in such circumstances should be vindicated under the s 49(ii) defence of innocence rather than s 49(i). This criminal reference is, however, not concerned with the exact dividing line between the two provisions._ **_The issue was examined in comprehensive detail in_****Trade Facilities****_and we do not intend, in the absence of detailed submissions on the point, to come to a decision one way or another. In any event, the end result would likely be the same._**_”_

> (emphasis Defence)

105    Essentially, with reference to **_Trade Facilities_**, the Defence submitted that in order for the defence of innocence to be established under Section 49(ii) of the Trade Mark Act, much will depend on the facts of each individual case. The question is if the Accused is not able to establish the elements of Section 49(i) of the Trade Marks Act, the elements being:

> (a)     whether reasonable precautions had been taken against committing an offence (i.e. possessing counterfeit goods) such that the accused had no reason to suspect the genuineness of the mark; and

> (b)     whether the accused had, on demand made by or on behalf of the prosecution, given all information in his power with respect to the persons from whom he obtained the goods,

where in the circumstances, he can still be regarded as having acted innocently in the commission of the offence (i.e. possessing counterfeit goods).

106    The Defence’s position was that the elements under Section 49(i) of the Trade Mark Act had been established and accordingly, a defence under Section 49(i) of the Trade Mark Act has been proven on a balance of probabilities. However, in the event that the Court finds otherwise, the Defence’s alternative submission is that in all circumstances, the Accused had acted innocently in the commission of the alleged offence.

107    The Defence had submitted that what was key towards the Accused’s innocence was the Accused’s understanding of genuine goods, seen in light of the trusted working relationship between the Accused and his supplier. To the Accused, genuine Apple products are products authorised by Apple for distribution and manufacture, products not authorised by Apple for distribution but authorised by Apple for manufacture (i.e. OEM products), and accessories that are removed from original Apple handphone packaging. This understanding as to genuineness, coupled with similar representations and assurances from his supplier as to the quality and nature of the goods which supplied with, as well as the fact that the supplier had never supplied the Accused with counterfeit goods or of poor quality, would naturally lead the Accused, as a matter of commercial sense and mutual trust and familiarity, to continue to deal with his supplier for the provision of goods. On the other hand, should the Accused conduct his business and/or dealings with his suppliers with paranoia, it would be difficult to see how the Accused’s business can be sustained, since this would impede and render everyday commerce impractical.

108    In fact, the Accused had testified that should he ever suspect that his supplier was selling counterfeit goods to him, the first thing the Accused would do would be to stop selling the products obtained from said supplier[^235], because to continue doing so would lead to very serious consequences[^236].

109    In the circumstances, the Defence submitted that the most that can be said about the Accused is that he had, as a matter of fact, relied on and trusted his supplier to provide him with genuine goods. However, this ought not be regarded as sufficient for criminal liability to be imposed upon the Accused under Section 49(c) of the Trade Mark Act.

110    On the issue of the reputation of the supplier, the Defence noted that the Prosecution is of the view that the Accused’s claim that his supplier Yu Xing Hang is a reputable supplier is untenable. The Defence submitted that there can be different reasons for good reputation: for example, a supplier may be reputable because he responds to sales enquiries promptly or because he gives good discounts on the products sold or because he could be trusted to always deliver the products on time. In the present case, to the Accused and for all business purposes, Yu Xing Hang is a reliable working partner who can be trusted to supply the Accused with quality products and it is this level of trust that forms the basis for the Accused’s statement that Yu Xing Hang is reputable[^237].

111    Finally, as regards to the Prosecution’s submission that the Accused is an unreliable and evasive witness, the Defence did not agree with the Prosecution’s on this issue[^238]. The Defence submitted that the Accused’s supposed avoidance in answering the Prosecution’s questions and second-guessing the same, must be considered taking into account the Accused’s background. The Accused is a Chinese national and a Singapore Permanent Resident who, while being able to understand English, has only a limited command of English and is more comfortable and proficient in Mandarin.

112    Given that the Accused is more proficient in and comfortable with communicating in Mandarin, it would be reasonable for him to ask the Prosecution clarificatory questions for better understanding. The Accused should not be unduly faulted for his inability to fully understand and properly discern and comprehend what was before him during trial.

113    Given the above, the Defence submitted that the Prosecution’s allegation that the Accused’s credibility is questionable is entirely without basis.

114    Given the above, the Defence was of the view that the Prosecution had not proven the elements of the charge under Section 49(c) of the Trade Mark Act beyond a reasonable doubt and the Defence respectfully urged this Court to acquit the Accused accordingly.

## O.   My Decision

115    In the present case, the Accused is charged under Section 49(c) of the Trade Marks Act that on 13 March 2017, at or about 2.05 pm, at 1 Yishun Industrial Street 1, #04-26, A’Posh Bizhub, Singapore that he had in his possession the said Goods for the purposes of trade to which the Apple trademarks had been falsely applied on them.

116    It is clear that under Section 49(c) of the Trade Marks Act, the burden is on the Prosecution to prove the following elements of the charge beyond reasonable doubt:-

> a.     That the Goods were in the possession of the Accused for the purpose of trade; and

> b.     That the trade marks applied to the Goods were falsely applied

117    Once the Prosecution is able to prove the above, the Accused is guilty of an offence under Section 49(c) unless he can show on a balance of probabilities:

> a.     that he had (i) taken all reasonable precautions against committing an offence, and (ii) at the time of the alleged offence, the Accused had no reason to suspect the genuineness of the mark; and (iii) on demand by or behalf of the Prosecution, the Accused gave all the information in his power with respect to the persons from whom he obtained the Goods; or

> b.     that he had acted innocently against committing an offence

## P.   The Issues before this Court

118    The issues that this Court will need to deal with are as follows:-

> a.     Whether the Goods seized were in the Accused’s possession for the purpose of trade or manufacture?

> b.     Whether the Goods are goods which the Apple trademarks are falsely applied on them?

119    If the Prosecution is unable to prove (a) and (b) above beyond reasonable doubt, I will have to acquit the Accused of the charge under Section 49(c) of the Trade Mark Act.

120    However, if the Prosecution is able to prove (a) and (b) above beyond reasonable doubt, then I need to consider the following:-

> i.     Whether the Accused:-

>> (a)       had taken all reasonable precautions against committing an offence under Section 49(c) and at the time of the alleged offence, he had no reason to suspect the genuineness of the trade marks; and

>> (b)       on demand by or on behalf of the Prosecution, the Accused gave all the information in his power with respect to the persons from whom he obtained the Goods.

> ii.     Alternatively, whether the Accused had acted innocently in the commission of the alleged offence.

121    If the Accused is able to prove on a balance of probability (i) or (ii) in paragraph 118 above, then he shall not be guilty of an offence under Section 49(c) of the Trade Marks Act.

### Whether the Accused had in his possession the Goods for the purposes of trade or manufacture

122    In the present, it is clear that both parties accepted the fact that the Accused had the Goods in his possession for the purposes of trade or manufacture[^239].

### Whether the Goods are goods which the Apple trademarks are falsely applied on them

123    In the present case, it is agreed between parties that the registered Apple trade marks were valid and subsisting at the time the Goods were seized by the police[^240].

124    The Prosecution had relied on the testimony of PW1 and PW2 and the Examination Report prepared by PW2. The Prosecution’s position is that PW2’s evidence together with the Examination Report amply establishes that the Goods are goods which the Apple trade marks have been falsely applied[^241].

125    The Defence disagrees with the Prosecution as they are of the view that seized Goods are genuine by reason that the Accused’s supplier’s assurance that the Goods were OEM and the Accused’s understanding that OEM products are genuine[^242]. The Defence also submitted that it is possible that the Goods are obtained from parallel sources of legitimate Apple products which may have made their way into the supplier’s hands through alternative distribution networks[^243].

126    The Defence also takes the view that PW2’s testimony and her Examination Report which used certain identifiers to assess the genuineness of the Goods was not sufficient to prove that the Goods are genuine or counterfeit[^244]

127    In the present case, on the issue of OEM products, I agree with the Prosecution that the term OEM is not a legal term but a trade term[^245]. In **_Singsung_**, the High Court had noted that OEM generally refers to a manufacturer who produces component for another manufacturer who then incorporates the component parts for another manufacturer. The High Court also noted that if Company A were to design and manufactures a product, which is sold to Company B and Company B releases and sells the products under its own brand, the Company A is not an OEM but an ODM (“original design manufacturer”)[^246].

128    I agree with the Prosecution that there can be many variants of the OEM/ODM relationship and whether an OEM/ODM product is a counterfeit or not would depend on their agreement between the trade mark owner and the OEM/ODM.

129    In this case, I also note that Section 47(6) of the Trade Marks Act clearly stipulates that in a prosecution under Section 49, the burden of proving the consent of the proprietor lies with the accused.

130    Looking at the evidence before me, all I see is a bare assertion by the Accused that his suppliers had informed him that the Magsafe Power Adapters and the batteries are OEM products. As regards to the rest of the seized Goods, the Accused himself is not sure whether his suppliers have informed him as to the rest of the seized Goods are OEM products. In the present case, the Defence is alleging that the seized Goods are OEM products and the onus is on the Defence to prove that they are OEM goods. However, in the present case, I agree with the Prosecution that the Accused has not provided any information as to the manufacturer of the Goods. The Accused has also not tendered any proof from his suppliers to show that the Goods were from Apple manufacturers. In this case, there is no evidence from the Accused to show that the seized Goods are OEM or ODM products.

131    I agree with the Prosecution that in order for there to be a meaningful discussion on whether an OEM/ODM is genuine or counterfeit, we would have to know the nature of the agreement between Apple and the OEM/ODM before we can even start to discuss the issue of whether the product is genuine or counterfeit. Given the lack of evidence and any specific factual matrix, I would agree with the Prosecution that it is impossible to have any meaningful discussion as to whether the Goods seized are manufactured by OEM/ODM or whether they are authentic or counterfeit.

132    Given that the law imposes the evidential burden of proving these assertions on the Accused, I am of the view that he has not managed to discharge evidential burden in this case.

133    As regards to the testimony and the Examination Report prepared by PW2, I note that PW2 will consider a variety of indicators when examining a product in order to determine the genuineness of the product. I also note that she will rely on different types of indicators such as serial numbers, packaging, quality of printing, design and the existence of safety fuse in order to determine if the product is a genuine product. I further note that PW2 will look for different indicators when examining different products and this may involve a combination of different indicators for different products in order to determine the genuineness of the products.

134    From her oral testimony and her Examination Report, it is clear to me that PW2 is well trained to look out for different indicators when examining different Apple products. She is familiar with the products that she is examining and she has the necessary expertise to examine the Goods. It is also clear that she is also well supported by other staff from Apple such as the engineers whom she can rely on to gain access to Apple’s database in order to get information about their products.

135    I agree with the Prosecution’s submission that the Examination Report is well-reasoned and clearly displayed PW2’s familiarity and expertise in assessing the authenticity of a product. I also accept with that PW2 is forthright and honest witness and she is prepared to give the benefit of doubt to the Accused if she is unable to conclude if a product is real or fake. This is evident from her Examination Report where she said that 8 of the 36 batteries were suspected to be “second hand used batteries”.

136    Given PW2’s testimony and her Examination Report, I would agree with the Prosecution that the evidence adduced established that the trade marks to the Goods could not have been applied with Apple’s consent.

137    As to the Defence’s contention that PW2’s testimony and her Examination Report cannot conclusively confirm if an Apple product is genuine or counterfeit as PW2 had picked on superficial indicators and her methods of assessment are inconsistent, I would respectfully disagree with the Defence on this.

138    Apple is a major producer of electronic products and their products are the targets of counterfeiters. In this regard, it is not unusual for Apple to put in place indicators in their products to help Apple identify their authentic products. From Apple’s viewpoint, Apple would want to install indicators in their products in such a manner a way that the general public will not able to notice or identify such indicators. Apple will also want to keep secret such information relating to these indicators so that the counterfeiters will not be able to copy their indicators when trying to counterfeit their products. It would be very foolish of Apple to want to inform the general public of the nature and location of the indicators used by them so that ordinary businessmen like the Accused are able to identify them in order to tell which are the genuine Apple products.

139    The Defence took issues with the indicators used by PW2 because they are of the view that a number of the indicators used did not deal with the products themselves but has to do with the packaging and the design. It is clear from PW2’s testimony that Apple when designing indicators for be used for different products will rely on the whole packaging and not just the product itself. As such Apple will combine different types of indicators to determine whether a product is genuine or counterfeit. Examples given by PW2 included the Magsafe Power Adapters, where Apple relied not only on serial numbers that is generated by a unique algorithm. In addition, Apple also has put in place other indicators in the overall product packaging whereby the Apple product is usually placed in white box with information that is printed on a label and stuck onto the box and had cellophane wrapped the same. As for USB-C Power Adapters, PW2 testified that indicators would include the safety fuse that can only be seen if opened in a certain manner and the hang tag which is always placed in a specific position.

140    Looking at PW2’s testimony, I can understand why she is unable to reply to the Defence Counsel’s questions relating to the Apple manufacturers and the reasons as to why she had used different indicators to look at the different Apple products that she had examined. All these information are trade secrets of Apple and it will not be appropriate for PW2 to disclose all these information in public as it will compromise the way Apple tries to protect its intellectual property rights. Given this, I would disagree with the Defence’s conclusion that PW2’s failure to explain is evidence that the Goods are neither genuine nor counterfeit.

141    Given the above, I am of the view that the Prosecution has proven beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused had in his possession the seized Goods for the purposes of trade to which the registered Apple trade marks had been falsely applied.

### Whether the Accused had taken all reasonable precautions against committing the offence and at the time of the commission of the offence, the Accused had no reason to suspect the genuineness of the trade marks

142    The case law in respect of this area is clear[^247]. In **_Koh Peng Kiat_**, the Court of Appeal had indicated that the Prosecution does not bear the burden of proving that the primary offender had knowledge that a registered trade mark had been falsely applied to goods which form the subject matter of the charge. The Court of Appeal also held that in relation to the 2 elements of “having taken all reasonable precautions” and “no reason to suspect the genuineness of the mark”, these were not independent requirements to be applied in a rigidly chronological or conditional order. Instead they were inextricably linked as part of a single composite enquiry in which the accused’s assertion that he had no reason to suspect that the goods were falsely applied with a registered trade mark was considered against an objective assessment of reasonableness and the adequacy of the precautions that were taken by the accused from the perspective of a reasonably prudent business in similar circumstances.

143    I agree with the Prosecution that in determining whether a defence under Section 49 is made out, some of the factors which had been considered by the Courts in Singapore included[^248]:

> a.     Price discrepancy between the counterfeit goods and the trade mark owner’s goods (see **_Creative Technology_** and **_Tan Lay Heong_**);

> b.     The reputation of the supplier (see **_Tan Lay Heong_**);

> c.     Whether the infringer had made the necessary inquiries with the supplier (see **_Chua Keng Fock_**); and

> d.     Whether the infringer had provided information as to the source of the goods (see **_Trade Facilities_**).

144    In the present case, having considered all the evidence before me and the submissions by the parties, I would agree with the Prosecution that the Accused had not taken all reasonable precautions against committing the offence and there was sufficient red flags present to give the Accused reason to suspect the genuineness of the trade marks on the Goods seized.

### i.   The Accused’s background

145    In the present case, the Accused started XKoo Tech from year end 2012 and he had been operating the business for almost 5 years at the date of the alleged offence.

146    The Accused conducts his business mainly on online platforms and he deals mainly with handphone accessories such as charging cables , ear pieces, phone batteries and power banks. It is also clear from the evidence that the Accused is solely in charge of the business and he is the only person responsible for the sourcing and buying of goods from the suppliers. The Accused is also solely responsible for sales of the goods using his online platform. The Accused’s customers would order on goods from him via the online platform and the Accused will be the person who will arrange for the goods to be delivered to the customers or for the customers to collect the products from his business address.

147    Given the above, I would say that the Accused is a fairly experienced businessman. It is also evident from the Agreed Statement of Facts that the Accused’s business has grown since 2012.

### ii.   The steps taken by the Accused to select his supplier

148    In this case, the Accused’s evidence is that he had 2 suppliers for Apple goods both of whom are located at Hua Qiang Bei. The Accused is unable to remember the name of his 1st supplier but the 2nd supplier is Yu Xing Hang. The Accused also confirmed that Yu Xing Hang was the supplier who had supplied the Accused with the seized Goods. Yu Xing Hang has shops in Hua Qiang Bei and Guangzhou. The Accused has been buying goods from Yu Xing Hang for at least 2 years before the alleged offence. For Yu Xing Hang, other than Apple products, the Accused has been buying other products such as Samsung products from this supplier. In the present case, the Accused decided to purchase Apple products from Yu Xing Hang because they have been supplying him with genuine Samsung products of good quality and they are a reliable supplier.

149    The Defence argued that the Accused had exercised prudence in selecting his suppliers for the Goods. The Accused had given evidence that he adopted a 3-step process in order to select his supplier:-

> i.     The Accused would look at the type of products offered by the suppliers. He would not choose suppliers with few products nor will he work with suppliers who only deal with newer products because the chances of these products being counterfeited are heightened. As such, the Accused would prefer to deal with a supplier who carries both new and old products as there is a lower probability that the said supplier would manufacture or sell counterfeit products;

> ii.     The Accused would consider his working relationship with the supplier; and

> iii.     The Accused would request for sample products from the supplier for testing. And he would observe the external appearance of the product and he would test the product to see if it is working properly. The Accused would also check online articles that provided guidance on how to differentiate between genuine and counterfeit products.

150    In the present case, the Accused’s position is that having put Yu Xing Hang through the above processes, he is of the view that Yu Xing Hang is a established reputable business.

151    However, I also noted that the Accused had admitted that he is not trained to spot the difference in counterfeit goods for Apple products and he had relied largely on the verbal assurance of Yu Xing Hang that the Apple products that they had delivered to him are genuine goods.

### iii.   Tests conducted by the Accused on the quality of the products

152    As regards to the tests conducted by the Accused as to the appearance and quality of the products supplied by Yu Xing Hang, The Defence tried to argue that this Court should consider the testing method from the perspective of the Accused. The Accused is also of the view that counterfeit goods tend to be of poorer quality. I would disagree with the position taken by the Accused on this point. In this regard, I agree with the Prosecution that such testing methods only goes towards the quality of a product and not whether a product is genuine or counterfeit. In the present case, I am of the view that no reasonably objective businessman would be so naïve to conclude that a product is genuine just because its quality is not bad. The Accused who is an experienced businessman should know the difference between these 2. And given that the Accused is not familiar with Apple products, it will be hard put for him to come to a conclusion that a product is of good quality given his unfamiliarity with the Apple products.

### iv.   Whether there is any evidence from the Accused’s supplier that the seized Goods are genuine

153    The Accused had testified that he had obtained Apple products from 2 suppliers, namely Yu Xing Hang and another supplier whose name he could not remember. However, the Accused also clarified that the seized Goods were supplied by Yu Xing Hang[^249].

154    The Accused had testified that his original business relationship with Yu Xing Hang was for the supply of other products including Samsung products. The Accused also gave evidence that for Samsung products, Yu Xing Hang had furnished evidence to the Accused that the Samsung products were genuine and the Accused had observed that the Samsung products were of good quality[^250]. And because of his working relationship with Yu Xing Hang as regards to the Samsung products, there is no reason for him to think that the Apple products supplied by Yu Xing Hang are not genuine products . More importantly, the Accused “did not hear from the mouth of the supplier that they are selling counterfeit products”[^251].

155    In the present case, I note that in the course of the Accused’s examination in chief, the Accused did not specifically say whether Yu Xing Hang had represented to him if the seized Goods were genuine save that in D1, Yu Xing Hang did post in their WeChat that they had Apple original battery and iPhone original adapter for sale[^252]. I also note that there is nothing in D1 to show that the power adapters and batteries were OEM products.

156    However, when the Accused was cross-examined by the learned DPP, the Accused testified on the 1st day of his cross-examination that:

> i.     He believed the seized Goods were genuine because his suppliers had told him so[^253]

> ii.     However, he went on to say that he did not have any documentary evidence from his supplier to show that the products were genuine but he had proof for his Samsung products[^254].

157    The Accused then went on to say that[^255]:-

> i.     There was no distributorship agreement between the Accused and Yu Xing Hang in relation to the seized Goods;

> ii.     The Accused did not have any kind of certificate of authenticity or authenticity report from Yu Xing Hang that the seized Goods were genuine Apple products. This is different from the Samsung products where the Accused did request and Yu Xing Hang did forward the necessary documentation to the Accused upon request.

> iii.     The Accused did not have any screenshots from WeChat or QQ messages between himself and Yu Xing Hang to confirm that the seized Goods were genuine.

158    On the 2nd day of his cross-examination, the Accused testified that as regards to the seized Goods[^256]:

> i.     For the 62 Magsafe Power Adapters, these are OEM products;

> ii.     For the iPhone batteries, these are also OEM products; and

> iii.     For the rest of the seized Goods, the Accused is not sure but he believed they were genuine products.

The Accused also testified that whenever he placed his order with the supplier, the supplier will inform him if the products were OEM and the supplier will inform him of the source of the products[^257].

159    It is clear to me that there is some inconsistency in the Accused’s evidence in court during his examination in chief and during his cross examination.

160    I note that other than his bare assertion, the Accused has not furnished any evidence as to how his suppliers had informed him that the seized Goods were genuine. In the absence of any further evidence, I can only conclude that the Accused did not make the necessary inquiries with Yu Xing Hang as to whether the seized Goods were genuine and that Yu Xing Hang inform or represent to the Accused that the seized Goods were genuine Apple products or OEM products. From the evidence before me, it is clear to me that the Accused had merely assumed and took it for granted that the seized Goods were genuine solely based on the fact that Yu Xing Hang had previously sold him genuine Samsung goods.

### v.   The relationship between the Accused and the supplier

161    In this case, I note that the Accused had been purchasing Samsung products from Yu Xing Hang before he started buying Apple products from the same supplier. When the Accused was dealing with Yu Xing Hang on the Samsung products, I note that he had requested from Yu Xing Hang all the relevant authentication reports to prove the genuineness of the Samsung products before he proceeded to deal with Yu Xing Hang on the Samsung products. Given the Accused’s prudence in wanting to ensure that he does not deal with counterfeit goods and this background, I find it strange that the Accused had decided not to subject his supplier to his usual standards of care by proving the authenticity of the products before purchasing the products from his supplier.

162    To me, this is also not the standard of care that I would expect of a prudent and reasonable businessman who is purchasing products from online vendors.

### vi.   The identity of the supplier of the Goods

163    In this case, having considered the Accused’s evidence, I note the following:-

> i.     Although the Accused had given evidence that he had 2 suppliers for Apple products, he can only remember the name of one supplier Yu Xing Hang and he could not remember the name of the other supplier.

> ii.     The Accused has only furnished the name of the supplier Yu Xing Hang and the general location of the supplier’s shop, which is Hua Qiang Bei, Shenzhen to PW1. The Accused did not furnish the actual address of Yu Xing Hang to PW1 when PW1 requested for the same. In Court, the Accused has also informed the Court that Yu Xing Hang operated another shop located in Guangzhou but the Accused also did not give the address of the shop in Guangzhou.

> iii.     I note the testimony from PW2 that Hua Qiang Bei is a concentration of 10 to 12 malls with each mall being about 8 to 10 storeys high. PW2 also testified that Hua Qiang Bei is the size of New York City financial district. This is not disputed by the Defence. As such, it would be like looking for a needle in a haystack without the actual address of Yu Xing Hang.

> iv.     The Accused is also unable to furnish any documents to show the existence of Yu Xing Hang other than his bare assertion of the same. In this regard, I note that the Accused believed that neither of his suppliers had a corporate website even though they were web based suppliers whom he had sourced from WeChat and Moments[^258]. I also note that D1 and D10 which were tendered by the Accused as evidence of his communication with his supplier did not disclose the supplier’s name or contact. There is no formal contract or distribution agreement between the Accused and Yu Xing Hang[^259]. The Accused did not any business registration information relating to Yu Xing Hang[^260] and he also claim that he did not have any invoices from Yu Xing Hang[^261].

> v.     Given the above, I would agree with the Prosecution that there is a big question mark as to identity of the Accused’s supplier or whether Yu Xing Hang even existed. As such, I am of the view that the Accused had failed to exercise prudence in the selecting of supplier.

### vii.   Any red flags surrounding the price and packaging of the Goods

164    It is clear from the case law cited that whilst pricing by itself cannot be the sole factor to determine whether a product is genuine or counterfeit, pricing is a relevant factor that the Courts would consider when determining whether a reasonably prudent businessman would be put on notice in order to require him to make further enquires on the genuineness of the products. In **_Tan Lay Heong_** , CJ Yong did comment that in certain circumstances, if the goods were of such obvious discrepant quality or the price is so low that any reasonable person would become suspicious, then the defence under Section 73 of the then Trade Mark Act may not be made out. As such, it is clear that if the pricing of the product is so low as compared to the price of the genuine product, the Courts will require the businessman to make further enquires in order to determine the genuineness of the products.

165    In the present case, looking at the tables prepared by the Prosecution in their Closing Submission[^262], especially in comparing the Accused’s selling price for the seized Goods and Apple’s recommended retail price for the seized Goods as set out in P52, it can be seen that the difference in pricing is between 30% to 69%. I would agree with the Prosecution that this shows a significant disparity in pricing between the Accused’s pricing and Apple’s recommended retail pricing.

166    The Defence’s response to this is that one cannot look at the different sale price because Apple‘s products “go for high profit margins”[^263]. The Accused also testified that his pricing of the Goods at a much lower markdown than Apple’s recommended retail pricing cannot imply that his products were counterfeit since other retailers of online Apple products such as Amazon also sold Apple products at a price much lower than Apple recommended retail pricing[^264].

167    I am unable to accept the Accused’s argument on this point because there is no evidence that the so called Apple products that are sold on Amazon are genuine Apple products. To me, even as a prospective buyer who is not an experienced businessman, in respect of untested online internet sellers claiming to sell genuine products, if I were to see a product being offered for sale at a much lower price than the retail price of an original product, I would myself be put on notice as to whether the product that is offered online is a genuine product. Given that the Accused is an experienced businessman, I am rather surprised that he will just accept what he sees on the internet as the truth without any further inquiry into what is posted on the net. Any prudent businessman who do not know the identity or reputation of such sellers, would have been put on notice if they were to see that the price of the online product is but a fraction of the price of the genuine product. I am of the view that given such circumstances, any businessman who is prepared to say that the online product is a genuine product without any further enquiry would not be able to say that he has taken all reasonable precaution and have no reason to suspect the genuineness of the product.

168    On the issue of packaging of the Goods, I note that the Accused had given evidence that he would expect his suppliers to send him Apple products in Apple packaging. As such, it is hard for me to accept the Accused’s argument that when he received the Magsafe Power Adapters in unmarked brown boxes, he is prepared to accept his supplier’s explanation that these are OEM products and therefore they need not be in Apple packaging and his suspicions is not raised[^265].

169    In this context, I would agree with the Prosecution’s submission that his response is devoid of logic and it is clearly a feeble attempt by the Accused to downplay his failure to conduct any further enquiry as to genuineness of the Goods.

### viii.   Whether the Accused took any precaution against possessing counterfeit goods

170    In considering all the above and taking into account the Accused’s overall conduct, I am of the view that the Accused had failed to take all the necessary precautions to determine of the seized Goods were genuine Apple products as a reasonable prudent businessman. The evidence presented also clearly showed that there were many red flags that were raised and the Accused should have conducted further enquiries accordingly.

### Whether the Accused, on demand made by or on behalf of the Prosecution, given all the information in his power with respect to his suppliers

171    In this case, as discussed earlier:-

> i.     The Accused had 2 suppliers for Apple products but he can only remember the name of one supplier Yu Xing Hang and he could not remember the name of the other supplier.

> ii.     The Accused has only furnished the name of the supplier Yu Xing Hang and the general location of the supplier’s shop, which is in Hua Qiang Bei to PW1.

> iii.     The Accused had provided the Prosecution with no other evidence to help identify the supplier of the seized Goods. The Accused believed that neither of his suppliers had a corporate website even though they were web based suppliers whom he had sourced from WeChat and Moments. D1 and D10 which were tendered by the Accused as evidence of his communication with his supplier did not disclose the supplier’s name or contact. The Accused also did not have an invoice from his supplier to confirm the name of the supplier.

> iv.     I also note the Accused’s evidence that when he would have different ways of ordering his goods from supplier. He would sometimes telephone the supplier, sometime he would use WeChat and sometimes he would get his friends in China to go down to the supplier’s shop to buy the same directly from the suppliers.

> v.     As regards to invoices issued by Yu Xing Hang, the Accused’s evidence is that he does not require any invoices from the supplier in China as invoices issued by China has no relevance in Singapore. The Accused’s position is that he does not require the invoices to do up his business accounts for his Singapore business as he has engaged professional accountants to do his accounts for his Singapore business and he has records of funds transfers to show how he pay for the his goods and that is sufficient.

> vi.     I also note that the Accused is able to keep track of the goods ordered from his supplier by creating D12 in his laptop. I note that D12 not only keeps track of the quantity of each product he has in his stock, it also contains information on the cost price of the products and his sale price which he is say is determined by a profit margin of 10 to 15% of the cost price taking into account the sale price of similar competitors in the online platform.

> vii.     The Accused’s position is that he has given all necessary information to the police when asked to do so.

> viii.     Having considered the Accused’s evidence, I would respectfully disagree with the Accused’s position that he has given all necessary information within his powers to the police.

> ix.     As discussed earlier, given the size of Hua Qiang Bei , the information which the Accused had given to the PW1 is totally useless for the Prosecution to establish the location of Yu Xing Hang. This is like someone informing the police that he had purchased the imitation goods from his supplier named “X” in Chinatown but with no supporting evidence of the existence of X or his dealings with X. In the first instance, the police is not even sure of the identity of X as there is nothing to show the identity of X. Also without any specific address, looking for X in Chinatown would be like looking for a needle in a haystack as there could be thousands of businesses operating in Chinatown.

> x.     In the present case, having regard to the Accused’s evidence, it is clear to me that he must have other information relating to the supplier which is within his knowledge or which he could easily have obtained which he had failed to furnish to PW1. In this case, the Accused should have the supplier’s telephone number as he had telephoned the supplier directly to order goods from the supplier. In this case, he should also have the actual address of Yu Xing Hang as he had asked his friends to go down to the supplier’s shop to purchase the goods directly from the supplier’. Also, in the Agreed State of Facts, the Accused had also stated that he had also gone to Shenzhen China to visit his suppliers to examine the goods that he was purchasing. So he must know of the actual address of Yu Xing Hang.

> xi.     I also disagree with the Accused’s contention that he did not have any invoices from his suppliers. I am of the view that the Accused must have the invoices from Yu Xing Hing as he is able to compile his cost prices and stock in hand in D12 in his laptop. Given that the Accused dealt with a large variety of goods from his suppliers, it would not be possible for him to remember everything that he had ordered from memory unless he referred to some form of records from the suppliers. I am of the view the only way he could have compiled D12 is with the help of the invoices. In this case, it is also clear from the Accused’s testimony that “he did not require invoices from the suppliers as invoices issued in China has no relevance in Singapore.”[^266] I understand this to mean that he does have invoices but he finds them of no relevance in Singapore.

> xii.     The Accused also takes the position that **_Tan Lay Heong_** requires him to disclose information in respect of the supplier and does not require him to disclose invoices and other documents which may prove useful to the trade mark proprietor or the Prosecution. While I agree with the position taken by the High Court in **_Tan Lay Heong_** that an accused is not required to disclose how many items he had bought from his supplier or to disclose invoices which may prove useful to the trade mark proprietor or the Prosecution, in this case, the purpose of producing the invoices is to help identify and prove the existence of Yu Xing Hang. It is clear from the evidence that there is no evidence whatsoever that the Accused had purchased the Goods from Yu Xing Hang save for his bare assertion. The invoices will confirm the existence of Yu Xing Hang as well as the fact that they are the suppliers. It is for this purpose that that the Accused ought to have given the invoices to the police. In fact, the Accused does not even need to forward the invoices relating to the Goods to the police. He could have given them invoices for other items which he had purchased from the same supplier which are not the subject matter of this charge in order to give the police the address of the supplier as well as to prove the existence of the supplier. In the present case, I also note that the Accused is saying that he decided to use the supplier for Apple products because this supplier had been selling him genuine Samsung products for more than 2 years and he found them reliable. The Accused could have easily given the Prosecution the invoices issued by this supplier for any of the Samsung products to help the Prosecution determine the identity of the supplier but he chose not to do that.

> xiii.     Having considered the above, I am of the view that the Accused had not, on the demand by Prosecution, given all information in his power with respect to the supplier.

### Whether the Accused acted innocently in the commissioning of the offence

172    Given the Accused’s conduct as discussed earlier on, I am of the view that it is clear from the facts that the Accused cannot be regarded as having acted innocently in the commissioning of the offence.

173    In the premises, having regard to all the evidence before me, I am of the view that the Prosecution has proven its case against the Accused and I hereby convict the Accused of the charge accordingly.

## P.   Other issues raised by the Accused

### That the Accused relied on the representation of Yu Xing Hang that the Goods are genuine

174    The Accused had submitted that it is not unreasonable for him to rely on the representation of Yu Xing Hang that the seized Goods are genuine Apple products as there is no reason for him to suspect the veracity of the supplier’s representation. In this context, the Defence had relied on **_Tan Lay Heong_** whereby the High Court had accepted that “_a reasonable balance must be struck between the rights of the trade mark owner and the practicable commercial reality that a retailer or distributor faces … The fact remains that in everyday commerce, reasonable businessmen rely on the assurance of their trading counterparts.”_ Accordingly, the Defence had submitted that it was perfectly reasonable for the Accused to rely on and believe in his supplier’s statements that the Apple goods were genuine given their working relationship[^267].

175    I had earlier in my judgment made a finding that there was no such representation made by Yu Xing Hang to the Accused that the seized Goods were genuine.

176    However, if I am wrong on this point and Yu Xing Hang did represent to the Accused that the seized Goods were genuine, I am of the following view:

> i.     I accept that in the case of **_Tan Lay Heong_**, the accuseds in that case was acquitted by the Court because the Court had accepted that they had , inter alia, relied on the reputation of their supplier. In **_Tan Lay Heong_**, the supplier involved was Sogo Department store which was a reputable and established business. There were already existing contracts between Sogo and the retailers to whom the accuseds had sold “Hunting World” goods. The retailers had not expressed any suspicions about the genuineness of the goods. In that case, one of Sogo’s manager, Maniam, had also assured the accuseds on the genuineness of the goods and it was not disputed that Maniam was an expert in genuine Hunting World products. Maniam was the one who had introduced the accuseds to Brogi as a supplier to Sogo.

> ii.     I agree with the Prosecution that difference between **_Tan Lay Heong_** and the present case is that in **_Tan Lay Heong_**, Sogo is an internationally renowned retailing group with a lot of reputation and goodwill. In the present case, I agree with the Prosecution that the Accused’s supplier Yu Xing Hang is an unknown. There is no information on the reputation of Yu Xing Hang save for the Accused’s bare assertion that Yu Xing Hang is a reputable supplier. In the present case, based on the evidence before me, the Accused has not provided any evidence to show that Yu Xing Hang is a reputable supplier. As such, I agree with the Prosecution that we should not place too much emphasis on the Accused’s reliance on Yu Xing Hang’s representation given that Yu Xing Hang is not a reputable supplier. In fact, as I had discussed earlier, I am also not totally convinced of the existence of Yu Xing Hang having considered the evidence before me. Therefore, I would agree with the Prosecution that the Accused has failed to show that his supplier is a reputable business concern.

### On the issue of cross-examination of PW2

177    The Defence had in paragraph 35 of the Defence’s Closing Submission submitted that “without the benefit of cross-examining Ms Ying (ie PW2) as the maker of the report, or even a conversation with Ms Ying to better understand the contents of the Report, a reader of the Report would be none the wiser as to the accuracy of the contents of the Report vis-à-vis the question of whether the seized Apple products are counterfeit”.

178    Paragraph 35 of the Defence’s Closing Submission gave the impression that I did not allow the Defence to cross-examine PW2 on her Examination report. I wish to state that that is not factually correct. What had in fact happened was that the Defence had applied for PW2 to be recalled to be cross-examined on her Examination Report on the 6th day of the trial. This issue arose during the cross-examination of PW3 in relation to DAC 939833-2017 for the Samsung products. There was a dispute between the parties as to numbers, types, models and colours of the Samsung cables and Samsung styles pens which were seized by the Prosecution[^268]. This issue arose on the 4th day of the trial on 9 April 2019 during the 2nd tranche of the trial. And I had suggested for parties to go through the items which were seized by the police in order for parties to come to some sort of agreement.

179    It is to be noted that PW2 had given her evidence on the 1st day of the trial on 10 September 2018 and it is clear from the Notes of Evidence that she was extensively crossed examined by the Defence Counsel on the issue of OEM products as well as the indicators which she had relied on to prove the genuineness of the Goods in her Examination Report[^269].

180    After the parties had examined the items which were seized by the police, the Defence informed me that they wished to recall PW2 to further cross-examine her on her Examination Report on fresh issues relating to the seized Goods arising from the examination. The Prosecution objected to the recalling of the PW2 on the basis that she had been extensively cross-examined in court on her Examination Report[^270].

181    I also noted that the police had seized the items from the Accused’s premises on 13 March 2017 and the Accused’s 1st appearance in Court in relation to the seized Goods was on 9 November 2017. Parties had also attend numerous pre-trial conferences and mentions before the matter was fixed for trial on 10 September 2018. This would mean that the Defence would have many opportunities to inspect the seized Goods before the matter went for trial.

182    Section 283(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code provided that:

> “(1)  A court may, on its own motion or on the application of the prosecution or the defence, at the close of the case for the defence, or at the end of any proceeding under this Code, summon a person as to a witness or examine a person in attendance as a witness, whether or not summoned, or recall and re-examine a person already examined “

183    The Prosecution also referred me to the commentaries by the editors of The Criminal Procedure Code of Singapore Annotations and Commentary, 2012 Edition, Academy Publishing where at \[at page 426\], the editors had noted[^271]:

> 14.238    Nevertheless, the courts have repeatedly held that the discretion to recall witnesses under section 399 of the old CPC must be exercised sparingly and judiciously for the just decision of the case (_Sim Cheng Hui v Public Prosecutor)_ \[1998\] 1 SLR (R) 670 and _Mohammad Ali bin Mohd Noor v Public Prosecutor_ \[1996\] 3 SLR (R) 692), and this principle is likely to continue to be applied by the courts in the exercise of their power under section 283. In this connection, it would appear that the courts’ determination on whether to recall witnesses or otherwise appear to be guided by practical considerations of the need to further the end of justice.

> 14.239    It would generally not be in the interests of justice to allow further cross-examination for a matter for which extensive cross-examination had already been undertaken. In _Yap Giau Beng Terence v Public Prosecutor_ \[1998\] 2 SLR (R) 855, for example, the court refused the Defence’s application to recall a prosecution on the ground that the witnessed had already been extensively cross-examined on the issue for which the Defence sought to recall him, and that it would be fruitless to recall the witness only for him to give the same evidence again. Similarly, the court will be slow to recall a witness where the failure to cross-examine initially appears to have been by design. In _Arts Niche Cyber Distribution Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor_ \[1999\] 2 SLR (R) 936, for example, the Defence argued that its failure to put relevant matters to the Prosecution’s witnesses could be remedied by the Prosecution or the trial judge recalling the Prosecution’s witnesses for cross-examination. On appeal, the court held that the Defence’s failure to put several matters to the Prosecution’s witnesses did not appear to be inadvertent, especially since there were too many instances of the Defence failing to put its case to the Prosecution’s witnesses. Coupled with the contradictory and inherently incredible nature of the defence, it would not have been appropriate for the trial judge to exercise her discretion to recall the Prosecution’s witnesses for cross-examination had such an application been made before her.”

184    It is clear from the case law that the Courts should exercise their discretion to recall witnesses sparingly and judiciously for the just decision of the case. It is also clear that it is generally not in the interests of justice to allow further cross-examination for a matter for which extensive cross-examination had already been undertaken.

185    In the present case, I agree with the Prosecution that the Defence was given sufficient opportunity to cross-examine PW2 on her testimony as well as her Examination Report when she was on the stand. I also agree that there was extensive cross-examination conducted by the Defence on PW2.

186    In this regard, I also note that the Defence had during the examination in chief of PW2’s accepted that the following items referred to in PW2’s Examination Report were counterfeit items and they had agreed to admit PW2’s Examination Report on these items by consent[^272]:-

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="12.7%"> <col width="23.42%"> <col width="63.88%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">No.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Exhibit No.</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Item</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">P6</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">8 USB-C Charging Cables</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">P7</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">50 Lightning to USB Cables</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">P8</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5 Lightning to Micro USB Adapters</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">P9</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2 Earpods</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">P9</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">20 Earpods with lightning connector</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6.</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">P10</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">28 iPhone Batteries</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

187    It is by the same token that the Defence had made a conscious decision not to cross examine PW2 on her Examination Report relating to some of the above items when she was on the stand. However, I also noted that even though the Accused accepted that the batteries that were seized were counterfeit products during the examination in chief of PW2, the Defence did cross- examine PW2 on the origins of the batteries and on the issue of whether they were OEM products.

188    Given that the Defence had ample opportunity to examine the Goods prior to the trial and that they had cross-examined PW2 extensively when she was on the stand, I am of the view that their application to recall PW2 to be further cross-examined is akin to them wanting to have a 2nd bite at the cherry. As such, I am of the view that it would not be in the interest of justice to allow any further cross-examination of PW2 on her Examination Report and I am not granting the Defence’s application.

## Q.    Prosecution Submission on Sentence

## i.   Background**[^273]**

189    The Prosecution had submitted that sentencing framework and applicable sentencing factors for offences under Section 49 of the Trade Marks Act are set out in the High Court cases in **_Goik Soon Guan v Public Prosecutor_** **<span class="citation">\[2015\] 2 SLR 655</span>** (_“_**_Goik Soon Guan_**_”_) and **_Tan Wei v Public Prosecutor_** **<span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 450</span>** (“**_Tan Wei_**”). In **_Goik Soon Guan_**, the High Court had set out extensively the relevant sentencing considerations and proper sentencing framework and in **_Tan Wei_**, the High Court further elaborated as to how these sentencing considerations should be applied.

## ii.   Principles in _Goik Soon Guan_**_[^274]_**

### (a)   Deterrence as the dominant sentencing principle

190    The Prosecution had pointed out that the High Court in **_Goik Soon Guan_** had affirmed that the primary sentencing consideration in trade mark or copyright infringement is deterrence. There is a strong public interest in maintaining a robust intellectual property protection framework, particularly in the context of an increasing global environment. Thus, it is crucial that strict measures are enforced so as to send a strong deterrent message to the public lest these efforts be undermined: **_Goik Soon Guan_** at \[18\] – \[20\].

### (b)   The sentencing framework for section 49(c) offences

191    The Prosecution also noted that in **_Goik Soon Guan_**, the High Court had found that the lower court had been inaccurate in stating that there was a benchmark sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment and above for offences under section 49(c) of the Trade Marks Act involving 1,000 or more infringing articles: at \[26\] – \[30\]. After a survey of the precedents, the High Court articulated the following sentencing framework for offences under section 49(c) of the Trade Marks Act (at \[31\]):

> a.     First, consider the nature and extent of the infringements, and the manner which it was carried out; and,

> b.     Second, examine whether there are any other relevant aggravating or mitigating factors.

192    The Prosecution noted that the High Court had observed that “_an appropriate starting point \[for sentencing\] would be the offender’s level of involvement in the whole operation relating to the section 49(c) Trade Marks Act offence_”: at \[32\]. There was a need to distinguish between a “distributor of infringing articles and an individual lower down the supply chain, such as a mere runner or a stall attendant”.

193    The High Court then went on to examine the facts and sentences imposed in a number of previous cases which had been dealt with by the Courts. Based on a survey of the cases, the High Court concluded that considering the degree of involvement of the offender (and not the number of infringing articles):

> a.     For cases with low involvement by the offender, the sentencing range would be two to four months’ imprisonment for each charge;

> b.     For cases with moderate involvement by the offender, the sentencing range would be six to seven months’ imprisonment for each charge; and,

> c.     For cases with high involvement by the offender, the sentencing range would be ten to 20 months’ imprisonment for each charge.

194    The High Court also added that “the complexity and scale of the operation involved would be a critical factor” in determining the offender’s involvement. Thereafter, the sentence would be calibrated depending on the number of infringing items as well as their value, any other relevant aggravating or mitigating factors of the case, and other unique circumstances which the trial judge might find as relevant: **_Goik Soon Guan_** at \[39\]. In this regard, the payment of compensation to affected trade mark owners was a relevant mitigating factor: at \[41\].

## iii.   Principles in _Tan Wei_**_[^275]_**

195    The Prosecution also pointed out that subsequently in **_Tan Wei_**, the High Court further refined the guidelines set out in **_Goik Soon Guan_**. In **_Tan Wei_**, the High Court emphasized that sentencing guidelines referred to in **_Goik Soon Guan_** (see above at \[40\]) merely provided a starting point. The actual sentence meted out for each charge under section 49(c) Trade Marks Act should be determined after the following factors are taken into account as well (at \[14\]):

> a.     The size of the offender’s business;

> b.     The number of employees in the offender’s business;

> c.     The financial figures of the offender’s business (in terms of both revenue and profits);

> d.     Whether a syndicate was involved;

> e.     The number of infringing articles involved;

> f.     The nature and value of the infringing articles;

> g.     The duration of the infringement;

> h.     The manner of infringement and the degree of permanence in the offender’s dealings with the infringing articles (e.g. whether the offender had a shopfront); and,

> i.     Whether compensation was made to the affected trade mark owners.

196    With regard to the number of infringing articles, the Prosecution noted that the High Court had warned against looking at the number of articles in isolation, without taking into account the nature of the infringing articles involved. As an illustration, the High Court assessed that selling 500 pairs of counterfeit earrings would be less serious than selling 100 counterfeit playstations: at \[16\].

197    The Prosecution also noted that the High Court had also advised exercising caution when assessing the gravity of offences under section 49(c) of the Trade Marks Act based on the number of charges which the offender faces particularly when a separate charge is brought for each class of goods, as well as for each instance of infringing a different trade mark proprietor’s intellectual property rights. It would be equally relevant to consider (amongst others) factors such as the number and nature of the items as well as their value – items of modest value cannot be treated in the same way as big-ticket items: **_Tan Wei_** at \[17\].

198    Finally, the Prosecution noted that the High Court in **_Tan Wei_** had highlighted that the number of charges brought against an offender could affect his total sentence, since two or more sentences may be ordered to run consecutively. The High Court emphasized that trial court should ensure that an offender facing three or more charges is not punished significantly more harshly than an offender facing less than three charges. The court should scrutinise the facts and calibrate the sentence appropriately, so that where an offender’s culpability is broadly the same as that of another offender, there should not be great disparity in their sentences even if the number of charges brought against them is different: at \[18\].

## iv.   Application of the Law to the Present Facts

199    In applying the law to the present facts, the Prosecution had urged me to consider the following factors[^276]:

### (a)   The Accused’s level of involvement

200    The Accused was the sole proprietor of XKoo Tech. The Accused handled all operational aspects of the business personally: he was the only person who sourced for goods from China, he alone determined the prices at which the goods were to be sold and handled the various online seller IDs on the e-commerce platforms. In light of these facts, the Prosecution submitted that the Accused’s level of involvement fell within the “Moderate” range.

### (b)   Material sentencing considerations

201    In the present case, the Prosecution had submitted that the following facts are material sentencing considerations:

> a.     The Accused had offered counterfeit Apple products for sale for a period of about 2 years before he was arrested;

> b.     The Accused was dealing in computer and handphone accessories having significant value namely power adaptors, charge cables, earpods and laptop batteries (cf. low cost goods such as clothing). If the Goods had been genuine products, they would have retailed at about $10,228 in total;

> c.     The sale price of each articles was between $8.50 - $47.60. Bearing in mind the low cost at which the Accused purchased each product, he stood to gain a profit of between 20% - 40% for each item sold; and,

> d.     Although the Accused did not have a permanent shop, the online platforms on which he sold the goods nonetheless made them available to a large audience nevertheless.

202    In relation to the nature of the items, the Prosecution had pointed out that some of the counterfeit products seized from the Accused were potentially unsafe for use[^277]. PW2 had observed that the 5 USB-C power adapters did not have any safety fuses in the plugs. In Court, PW2 had explained that these safety fuses helped to make the product safe. The fact that the counterfeit power adapters did not have such safety features demonstrated the potential harm arising from selling counterfeit computer/handphone accessories.

## v.   Prosecution’s submissions on sentence**[^278]**

203    The Prosecution had also tendered a table of sentencing precedents involving untraced offenders who pleaded guilty to offences under section 49(c) Trade Marks Act. The Prosecution had submitted that the table of sentencing precedents clearly shows that for offenders whose involvement fall in the “Moderate” scale, a custodial sentence is typically imposed. Specifically, the case of _PP v Niki Han Jiayi_ illustrates that custodial sentences have been imposed even if the number of goods involved is low (less than 100) and compensation is made.

204    The Prosecution had also submitted that the facts of this case are similar to the precedent case of _PP v Wang Zhenfu_, save for two important distinguishing factors namely, the offender in _Wang Zhenfu_ only sold apparel and the offender pleaded guilty at the earlier opportunity. On the other hand, as highlighted above, the Accused sold computer and handphone accessories and claimed trial. The Prosecution was of the view that there are no strong mitigating factors in the present case.

205    Having regard to the Accused’s “moderate” level of involvement as well as the sentencing considerations highlighted above, the Prosecution submitted that the appropriate sentence in the present case would be a custodial term of at least 3 months’ imprisonment.

206    In light of the foregoing, the Prosecution respectfully urged this Court to impose a custodial term of **at least 3 months’ imprisonment** in respect of DAC 939832-2017.

207    For completeness, the Prosecution also applied for a Discharge Amounting to an Acquittal for DAC 939833-2017 (for the Samsung products).

## R.   Defence’s Mitigation Plea and Sentencing Position

## i.   Mitigating Factors**_[^279]_**

208    The Defence had pointed out to me the following mitigation factors:-

> a.     The Accused is a Chinese National male, of 39 years of age.

> b.     The Accused is married with 2 children, aged 5 and 12. His wife and children reside with him in Singapore.

> c.     The Accused did not have any prior antecedents.

> d.     During the investigations by the police following a raid of the Accused’s business premises on 13 March 2017, the Accused had cooperated fully with the investigations.

> e.     The Accused has not committed any other offences since he was charged in Court on 6 November 2017.

209    The Defence submitted that a custodial sentence will also cause further hardship to the Accused for the following reasons[^280]:

> (a)     The Accused has been operating a small business on his own in Singapore in order to earn a living and support his family. A custodial sentence will cause any means for the Accused to support his family to cease;

> (b)     The Accused is currently indebted to various banks. A custodial sentence will cause the Accused to be unable to repay his debts as he would have lost his only means of income i.e. his business, or alternatively he would not be able to look for an additional job to earn money and repay his debts. This would only worsen his current trying financial situation; and

> (c)     The Accused’s children are still in their formative years and will require the presence of their father to guide and care for them, particularly since the Accused’s wife, who holds a full-time job as a teacher, will struggle to look after their children single-handedly if a custodial sentence were to be imposed on the Accused.

210    The Defence also pointed out that the Accused has never been a member of any syndicate, nor has he been involved in any large-scale operation to sell the items that were found to be counterfeit in this case.

211    The Defence also maintained that the Accused verily believed that he had received and was selling genuine Apple products, given that his supplier, who had indeed provided him with genuine products of other electronic brands, had given him assurances that the Apple products too were genuine.

## ii.   Defence’s Sentencing Considerations and Precedents**_[^281]_**

212    The Defence’s position on the case law relating to Section 49 of the Trade Marks Act is in line with the position taken by the Prosecution. The Defence also submitted in respect of the imposition of a sentence under Section 49 of the Trade Marks Act, **_Goik Soon Guan_** had affirmed that the primary sentencing consideration in cases of trade mark or copyright infringement is deterrence. This is because strong intellectual property protection is an integral component of Singapore’s economic and industrial policy, and a robust intellectual property framework is needed suit an increasingly global environment. The key principle of deterrence has been recognised in earlier cases, with **_PP v Kwan Eddy Shu Kin_** <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGDC 163</span> (“**_Kwan Eddy_**”) stating that the object of deterrence is to discourage the offender and others from such acts which can be lucrative and are not easily detected[^282].

213    The Defence is also in agreement with the Prosecution on the sentencing framework for offences under Section 49(c) of the Trade Marks Act as set out in **_Goik Soon Guan_**, which is:

> (a)     First, consider the nature and extent of the infringements, and the manner which it was carried out; and

> (b)     Second, examine whether there are any other relevant aggravating or mitigating factors.

214    The Defence also highlighted that in **_Goik Soon Guan_**, the High Court has indicated that an appropriate starting point would be the offender’s level of involvement in the whole operation relating to the Section 49(c) Trade Marks Act offence. The High Court had also \[at 32\] noted a need to “_distinguish between, for example, a distributor of infringing articles and an individual lower down in the supply chain, such as a mere runner or a stall attendant_”.

215    The Defence also pointed out that in **_Giok Soon Guan_**, the High Court had noted that, considering the degree of involvement of the offender[^283]:

> (a)     For cases with low involvement by the offender, the sentencing range would be from two to four months’ imprisonment for each charge;

> (b)     For cases with moderate involvement by the offender, the sentencing range would be from six to seven months’ imprisonment for each charge; and

> (c)     For cases with high involvement by the offender, the sentencing range would be from ten to 20 months’ imprisonment for each charge.

The High Court also noted that the complexity and scale of the whole operation involved would be a critical factor in determining the offender’s involvement. Then, the sentence should be revised either upwards or downwards depending on the number of infringing items as well as their value, other relevant aggravating/mitigating circumstances of the case and other unique circumstances which the trial judge might find relevant.

216    The Defence is also in agreement with the Prosecution on the factors to be taken into account as laid down in **_Tan Wei_**, in order for the Court to determine the sentence to be imposed.

## iii.   Defence’s Submission on Sentence**[^284]**

### Accused’s level of involvement in the operation

217    The Accused was the sole proprietor of XKoo Tech, and mainly worked alone by sourcing for goods from China and pricing the goods to be sold. The Defence submitted that his level of involvement would fall within the ‘moderate’ range.

### Prior good conduct

218    The Defence highlighted that this is the Accused’s first brush with the law. The Accused does not have any prior antecedents.

219    The Defence also pointed that in **_Kwan Eddy_**, the sentence imposed was that of a fine totalling S$30,000, for 1,818 infringing items for four charges. Even though a fine was imposed, more importantly, the Court stated that the accused’s previous good conduct was material, and that this merited some consideration in determining the appropriate sentence.

220    Similarly, in **_PP v Liu Chia-Shih and Anor_** <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGDC 161</span> (“**_Liu Chia- Shih_**”), the Court took into close consideration the fact that the accused persons were first offenders without any criminal records in Singapore, and regarded this as sufficient.

### Size of Accused’s business

221    In **_PP v Chan Yoke Mee_** <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 103</span> (“**_Chan Yoke Mee_**”), the accused and her husband had operated out of a single unit in International Plaza. The Court in **_Chan Yoke Mee_** contrasted this to the situation in **_Goik Soon Guan_**, where the accused there had rented out a shop as well as operated out of temporary makeshift stalls located at night markets and outside shops in heartland operations. The Court also highlighted that this also was different from the situation in **_Ong Ah Tiong_**, where the accused was regarded as having run a syndicated, an extremely organised operation or a large scale distributorship. Ultimately, the Court in **_Chan Yoke Mee_** considered the case before it to be “less serious”.

222    In the present case, the Defence submitted that the Accused had operated out of a single unit in A’Posh Bizhub. While the Accused also sold his goods on online platforms, the Defence submitted that the scale of his business was still small and relatively simple, given that he was mainly working alone.

223    The Defence also submitted that there is no evidence to suggest that the Accused ran a syndicated, an extremely organised operation or a large-scale distributorship.

### Nature of infringing articles

224    The Defence pointed out that the Accused also received little to no complaints from his customers about the quality of the goods.

225    While the infringing items pertained to computer and handphone accessories, the prices at which the items were sold by the Accused were generally not substantially or drastically cheaper than the recommended retail price of such items, given that they were, on average, about 50% cheaper than the recommended retail price.

226    The Defence noted that the average difference between the price at which the Accused obtained the infringing items and the recommended retail price of such items was generally around 68%. This also meant that on average, the Accused’s profit would have been around 20% or slightly lower.

227    The Defence had highlighted that this was in stark contrast with **_PP v Huang Rui Fang_** <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 28</span> (“**_Huang Rui Fang_**”), where the accused’s profit per item was 100% of the cost price. The accused was ultimately sentenced to 12 weeks’ imprisonment, in respect of 212 items.

### Number of infringing items

228    The Defence pointed out that the number of infringing items in the Accused’s possession was 198.

229    In **_Chan Yoke Mee_**, which concerned 178 infringing items for five charges, the Prosecution had asked for a sentence of six to eight weeks’ imprisonment per charge, and sought to rely on **_Goik Soon Guan_** in doing so. The Court in **_Chan Yoke Mee_** noted that the individual sentence imposed should be reflective of the number of infringing items for the proceeded charge, and stated that a custodial sentence was warranted in **_Goik Soon Guan_** because the number of infringing items for the proceeded charges were substantially more.

230    In **_Goik Soon Guan_**, the number of infringing products was 6,415 in total. A global imprisonment term of 9 months was ultimately imposed on the accused. The Defence was of the view that for the present case, it involved 198 infringing items in respect of a single charge. As such, this case is starkly different from the situation in **_Goik Soon Guan_**.

231    In the circumstances, while a custodial sentence would be warranted given the Accused’s capacity as a ‘moderate’ level offender, the Defence submitted that, in light of the various mitigating factors above, that a custodial term of **3 months’ imprisonment** should imposed on the Accused.

## S.   My Sentence

232    Having considered the sentencing framework and the factors to be considered as laid down in **_Goik Soon Guan_** and **_Tan Wei_** , I would agree that the Accused’s level of involvement should be in the moderate range and given his level of involvement, a custodial sentence is warranted.

233    I also took into account the following factors in my sentencing consideration:-

> i.     That this is the Accused’s 1st brush with the law.

> ii.     That while the Accused was the sole operator of XKhoo Tech and he was running the whole operation by himself, his operation was a one-man operation and not a well-organised or large-scale syndicated operation.

> iii.     I also took into the nature of the goods that the Accused was dealing with. I note that he was dealing with mainly handphone and computer parts. These are high valued and highly sought after goods. They also offer higher profits as compared to low cost items such as clothings.

> iv.     I also took into account the number of items involved which is 198 and the value of the items involved.

> v.     I also noted that the Accused did not operate any physical shopfront and he operated his business on the internet platform. In this context, I would agree with the Prosecution that whilst the Accused did not have any physical shopfront, the fact that he operated on an internet platform clearly show that there is a potential reach to a much wider and larger audience.

> vi.     I also accept the Prosecution’s submission that some of the items such as the USB-C power adapters did not have safety fuses installed in them and this is a cause of concern as the counterfeit product is potentially unsafe for use as it may cause electrical shocks and fires.

> vii.     I also noted the Accused’s mitigating factors as highlighted by the Defence.

234    In this case, as the Accused has claimed trial to the charge, the usual sentencing discount which is offered to a party who pleads guilty to a charge is not applicable to the Accused.

235    After taking into account all the sentencing considerations and having regard to the table of precedents provided by both parties, I would agree with parties that a reasonable sentence to be imposed for DAC 939832-2017 is 3 months’ imprisonment.

236    I also wish to state that after I had pronounced my sentence for DAC 939832-2017 on 6 March 2020, the Prosecution had applied for a Discharge Amounting to An Acquittal (“DATA”) for DAC 939833-2017 and I had granted a DATA on DAC 939833-2017 accordingly.
