29 April 2022

### District Judge Marvin Bay:

##### INTRODUCTION

1       This appeal by Cheow Boon Peng (Mr Cheow), a Singaporean presently aged 43, arose from proceeding brought by the State against two accused persons, Mr Cheow and Ms Kuan Pooi Yee (''Ms Kuan''), concerning their respective roles in a conspiracy to cheat the Ministry of Home Affairs (''MHA'') by submitting false quotations for works required by MHA. The scheme essentially involved the submission of fictitious quotations to the involved works requested by MHA departments for bidding in construction and renovation projects. These quotations paved the way for their company; Buildforms Construction Pte Ltd (“_Buildforms Construction_”) to be awarded projects worth $165,269.60. _Buildforms Construction_ was, as eponymously suggested, in the construction business, performing renovation works, along with steel, wood, and plumbing works, among other associated activities.

2       Mr Cheow was the undisputed mastermind of the scheme. As the General Manager of _Buildforms Construction_, he had devised and overseen a scheme to circumvent a requirement to source for and submit at least _three_ genuine quotations made by three different, independent companies which were required for a category of works known as _'star rate_' works (such works entailed the majority of the charges against him). Mr Cheow and Ms Kuan had instead instructed their staff at _Buildforms Construction_ to submit fictitious quotations for the _star rate_ works. For these fictitious quotations, the staff were taught by the accused persons to ''randomly'' enter a price, on the sole stipulation that this price had to be **_higher_** than the price quoted by _Buildforms Construction_. This had essentially ensured that _Buildforms Construction's_ quoted price would be the lowest submitted for the particular ‘_star rate_’ work requested by the MHA department, with a practical concomitant guarantee that the company would land the project they had quoted for.

### Mid-trial plea of guilt

3       The accused persons had initially claimed trial, and the prosecution had proceeded with no fewer than 62 charges against Mr Cheow and Ms Kuan. After some 41 days of trial, Mr Cheow and Ms Kuan had, after some additional time for negotiations and discussion agreed to plead guilty, to a slate of eight section 420 charges and two section 417 Penal Code charges that had been proposed by the prosecution. The prosecution had also proposed a global sentence of 23 months’ imprisonment from a run of three consecutive sentences. A non-custodial sentence was recommended from Ms Kuan’s case[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1), as she was deemed less culpable, even as she was still considered to have played a substantial role in instructing _Buildforms Construction_ staff on how to perpetrate the forgeries, on a run of three charges of cheating _simpliciter_ under section 417 of the Penal Code. Against Mr Cheow, the following sentences had been imposed:

### The appeal

4       The accused has appealed against the global sentence (comprised of a consecutive run of three sentences in DAC-922427-2017, DAC-922560-2017, and DAC-922563-2017) of **_19 months’ imprisonment_**, which had been imposed.

### The proceeded charges

### The eight section 420 Penal Code Charges

5       The first eight charges, while differing in amounts involved, time of commission, MHA department concerned and related particulars; are broadly similar in genre and _modi operandi_, it would thus add unnecessary prolixity to these grounds to set out all of these charges. I have therefore set out just **_one_** section 420 Penal Code charge[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) as a reference and to afford discussion on the constituent ingredients of the charge:

> (_Mr Cheow stands_) charged that (_he_), on or about 25 April 2014, in Singapore, did abet by engaging in a conspiracy with one Kuan Pooi Yee to do a certain thing, namely **_to cheat, and in pursuance of that conspiracy_** and in order to the doing of that thing, an act took place on or about 25 April 2014, to wit, (he) instructed (his) employee from Buildforms Construction (Pte) Ltd (“Buildforms Construction”) **_to submit three quotations_** (see Annex 48), **_not all of which were genuinely obtained or genuinely priced_**, to the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (“ICA”) through the Facilities Management Manager, CPG Facilities Management Pte Ltd, to deceive the ICA into believing that Buildforms Construction submitted the lowest out of three genuine quotations, which (_he_) knew to be false, and by such manner of deception, **_did dishonestly induce the ICA to make a valuable security_**, namely a Purchase Order \[serial number MHA/ICA/number\] amounting to $43,700 to the Term Contractor, Logistics Construction Pte Ltd, for works to be performed by Buildforms Construction, which offence was committed in consequence of (_his_) abetment, and (_he has_) thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 420 read with Section 109 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008

> Revised Edition).

> \[Emphasis added\]

### The two section 417 Penal Code charges

6       Mr Cheow also faced two section 417 Penal Code charges, with one of the two charges set out below. It should be noted that the latter two section 417 PC charges were based on the act being likely to cause **_harm_** to the MHA department **_in reputation and property_**, while the eight section 420 PC charges concerned the **_dishonest inducing_** of the MHA department to make a **_valuable security_**. The specific framing of the respective charges was, of course, predicated on the constituent elements of the different charges within the Penal Code, with the section 420 charge carrying a heavier maximum penalty of 10 years’ imprisonment against the cheating _simpliciter_ term of three years’ imprisonment stipulated under section 417 of the Penal Code. For reference, one of this brace of charges; the ninth proceeded charge[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3), reads:

> (_Mr Cheow_) is charged that (_he_), on or about 14 March 2014, in Singapore, did abet by engaging in a conspiracy with one Kuan Pooi Yee to do a certain thing, namely **_to cheat, and in pursuance of that conspiracy_** and in order to the doing of that thing, an act took place on or about 14 March 2014, to wit, (_he_) instructed (_his_) employee from Buildforms Construction (Pte) Ltd (“Buildforms Construction”) to submit three quotations (see Annex 59), not all of which were genuinely obtained or genuinely priced, to the Singapore Police Force (“SPF”) through the Facilities Management Manager, CPG Facilities Management Pte Ltd, to deceive the SPF into believing that Buildforms Construction submitted the lowest out of three genuine quotations, which (_he_) knew to be false, and by such manner of deception, did intentionally induce the SPF to award the job amounting to $2,650 to the Term Contractor, Logistics Construction Pte Ltd, for works to be performed by Buildforms Construction, an act which the SPF would not have done had they not been so deceived, **_and which act was likely to cause harm to SPF in reputation and property_**, which offence was committed in consequence of your abetment, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 417 read with Section 109 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Revised Edition).

### TIC charges

7       Mr Cheow also consented to the remaining 52[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4) charges being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

## Admitted Facts

## Statement of Facts

8       In the Statement of Facts which Mr Cheow accepted without qualification, a detailed background was lain to enable a proper understanding of the parties and processes involved. This aspect would be critical for a proper understanding of the scheme to cheat on false quotations. In setting out the Statement of Facts, I will **_paraphrase_** background or peripheral details (in the interest of brevity and relevance, while allowing for contextual explication where this is useful) but set out the more critical details, such as the exact manner of commission of the offences in full **_quote_** form, to allow a better appreciation of the specific facts that Mr Cheow had actually admitted without qualification to.

## Background of the bidding process for MHA contracts

### MHA West Zone Term Contract

9       Mr Cheow’s scheme had been made possible after his company had taken over the role of handling a Term Contract to fulfil the needs of MHA departments in the West Zone. The sequence of events had begun on 14 December 2011, when the Ministry of Home Affairs appointed Logistics Construction Pte Ltd (“_Logistics Construction_”) as the Term Contractor for the maintenance, addition, and alteration of building works for Home Team Departments in the West Zone of Singapore. The MHA Term Contract between MHA and _Logistics Construction_ (“MHA Term Contract”) was to run a duration between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2014, and cover the following four Home Team Departments[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5):

> (i)     Singapore Police Force (“SPF”);

> (ii)     Home Team Academy (“HTA”);

> (iii)     Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (“ICA”); and

> (iv)     Singapore Civil Defence Force (“SCDF”).

### Facilities Management Manager

10     The MHA Term Contract was overseen and managed by dedicated Facilities Management Managers that MHA had appointed, with their scope of work encompassing liaison with contractors, checking of documents submitted by contractors, and certifying the completion of works. I should add that much of the prior trial hearing (before the concession of the accused persons) had engaged the question of what these Facilities Management Managers knew, or ought have known, of the quotations, and that they had provided oversight to ensure that the quotations at the material time were not overpriced. The argument being that, despite the forged quotations, the prices charged by _Buildforms Construction_ were fair, and certainly not extortionate. Mr Cheow had worked with two sets of Facilities Management in the three years spanning the offences. They were[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6):

> (i)     CPG Facilities Management Pte Ltd (“CPG”) between 1 January 2012 and 31 March 2014; and

> (ii)     DTZ Facilities & Engineering (S) Limited (“DTZ”) between 1 April 2014 and 25 August 2014.

### Star Rate Works and obligation of Term Contractor

11     Turning now to explain ‘_star rate works_’, the MHA Term Contract, had stipulated for the costing of construction works to be generally based on the agreed unit prices listed within a Schedule of Rates. Works that were not found in the Schedule of Rates that were classified as _star rate_ works. Under the MHA Term Contract entered into by _Logistics Construction_, for such _star rate_ works, the Term Contractor had been required to source for three quotations from ACRA-registered contractors and submit cost estimates based on the lowest of the three quotations obtained, through the Facilities Management Manager, to the relevant Home Team departments for consideration. The procedure was meticulously explained in the Statement of Facts[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7):

> 10.    To determine the price of star rate works under the MHA Term Contract, Logistics (_Construction_) had to source for at least three quotations for the works from three different ACRA registered contractors.

> 11.    Logistics (_Construction_) had to submit the three quotations for the star rate work to the FMM (i.e. CPG or DTZ). CPG or DTZ reviewed the received quotations and submitted its recommendation to the relevant MHA department on which quotation to accept for the relevant star rate work.

> 12.     **_Generally, the star rate works would be awarded to the lowest priced quotation that meets MHA’s requirements for the works, and which offers the best value for money._** Once MHA accepted a quotation for the star rate work, a Work Instruction or Purchase Order would be issued to Logistics (_Construction_) instructing the contractor to commence work.

> \[Emphasis added\]

### Logistics Construction’s sub-contract to Buildforms Construction

12     In December 2011 after being appointed Term Contractor, _Logistics Construction_ had, in turn **_sub-contracted_** the MHA Term Contract to _Buildforms Construction_. The agreement was initially by an oral contract, which was formalised into a written sub-contract on 15 December 2012.[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8) Under the sub-contract agreement, Mr Cheow’s company was _Logistics Construction’s_ sole sub-contractor for all building works required by MHA under the MHA Term Contract, and was consequently responsible for sourcing for quotations for _star-rate_ construction works under that Term Contract. As succinctly stated in the Statement of Facts “ _(i)n essence, Buildforms_ (Construction_) stepped into the shoes of Logistics in relation to the MHA Term Contract_”[^9]

### Requirement of three quotations from independent companies

13     For certain subsequent star rate construction works, to determine the cost of star rate works, _Buildforms Construction_ was “_required to submit at least three genuine quotations given by three different, independent companies_.”[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10) The company could include their **_own_** quotation as one of the three requisite quotations.

### Arrangement to pay Logistics Construction upon successful bidding by Buildforms Construction

14     As indicated, _Buildforms Construction_ could submit their own quotation as one of the three quotations for the star rate work. In the situation of a successful bid where _Buildform Construction’s_ quoted price was accepted by MHA, Mr Cheow’s company would effect the performance or supply of the star rate works. Pursuant to the MHA Term Contract, for star rate works performed by _Buildforms Construction_, _Logistics Construction_ would e-invoice MHA for the work completed by _Buildforms Construction_ at 105% of their quoted price.

15     When _Logistics Construction_ received payment from MHA, _Logistics Construction_ simply paid _Buildforms Construction_ its full quoted price and retained the residual five percent of the quoted price for themselves.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11) There was no dispute that Mr Cheow, during the period the offences were committed, had full managerial control and oversight of “_all the works and processes that Buildforms_ (Construction) _had to perform pursuant to its obligations under the MHA Term Contract_”. [^12]

### Rationale for requiring three quotations for procurement processes

16     The rationale for requiring three quotations has also been explicitly stated to be with a view to providing an environment conducive to transparency and open competition in the procurement process. MHA’s principal intentions in implementing the process of sourcing multiple quotation for were two-fold,[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13) first in ensuring that star rate works best met MHA’s requirements and secondly, that the party awarded the works offered the best value for money.

## The conspiracy between the co-accused persons

### Asserted motivation of avoiding liquidated damages for late quotations

17     A central issue in this case had been the provision for liquidated damages under the MHA Term Contract, where _Buildforms Construction_ had _vide_ the sub-contract agreement between itself and Logistics Construction, effectively stepped into the shoes of the latter. This of course included the obligation for _Buildforms Construction_ to submit three quotations to the MHA departments within timelines set out in the MHA Term Contract. The timelines would be breached where for works with an estimated value below S$20,000, quotations were not submitted **_within_** seven working days from the date of request. In the intermediate band, for works with an estimated value above S$20,000 but not exceeding S$50,000, this time-line was stipulated to be on or before ten working days from the date of request. A longer grace period of 14 days from the date of request had been allowed for works with an estimated value above $50 000. If _Buildforms Construction_ failed to submit three quotations within the stipulated time, the company would have been, _per_ the MHA Term Contract, liable to pay liquidated damages of $50 per missing quotation per day. Mr Cheow had alluded to having embarked on his scheme to falsify invoices after encountering difficulties in maintaining the timelines, as a result of obduracy on the part of external contractors in submitting quotations in a timely manner.

### Specific admissions to modus operandi

18     The next part of this section within the grounds will deal with the accused’s admitted actions and criminal intent in perpetrating his offences. Given the interest of presenting these in a precise manner to allow discussion and analysis, I will set out these passages from the Joint Statement of Facts in _verbatim_[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14):

> 22.    Cheow and Kuan, through Buildforms had initially attempted to obtain genuine quotations from other sub-contractors for star rate work. However, the sub-contractors did not always respond. Sometime in early January 2012, **_Cheow came up with the idea to prepare fictitious quotations_** of other companies to be submitted together with Buildforms’ own quotation to the FMM as part of the three quotations required for star rate works under the MHA Term Contract.

> 23.     **_Cheow’s plan was to ensure that Buildforms’ quotation was always the lowest priced of the three submitted quotations_** for the relevant star rate work, by inputting higher prices in the fictitious quotations. This was to ensure Buildforms would be awarded the work by the relevant MHA department. Cheow informed Kuan of his idea and she agreed with it. Cheow then taught Kuan how to prepare fictitious quotations of other companies for this purpose.

> 24.    Cheow and Kuan therefore entered into a conspiracy to cheat MHA by preparing fictitious quotations of companies other than Buildforms to submit to the various MHA departments.

> 25.    Cheow and Kuan agreed that:

>> a.    Kuan would teach some of the administrative staff employed by Buildforms (“the admin staff”) how to prepare the fictitious quotations, after learning this from Cheow. The admin staff that Kuan taught then taught other admin staff how to prepare the fictitious quotations.

>> b.     **_The fictitious quotations prepared by the admin staff would be priced higher than the price on Buildforms’ quotations, so that Buildforms’ quotations would always appear to be the lowest priced quotation out of three quotations_** submitted to the FMM and the relevant MHA department.

>> c.    Buildforms would submit the fictitious quotations, along with Buildforms’ quotation, to the FMM and the relevant MHA department for star rate works under the MHA Term Contract.

>> d.     **_The purpose of submitting the fictitious quotations was to deceive the relevant MHA department into believing that Buildforms submitted the lowest priced quotation_**, and thereby dishonestly induce the MHA department to award the star rate work to Buildforms by making a valuable security in the form of a Work Instruction or a Purchase Order for the star rate works to be performed by Buildforms.

> 26.    The fictitious quotations were created under the letterheads of the following companies:

>> a.    Gecko Design & Woodworks Pte Ltd (“Gecko”);

>> b.    E/S Cleaning & Maintenance Enterprise (“E/S Cleaning”); and

>> c.    Air Builder Pte Ltd (“Air Builder”).

> 27.     **_For the falsified quotations_**…, Buildforms, **_Cheow_** or Kuan **_never obtained the relevant company’s authorisation to set the prices on the falsified quotations_**.

> \[Emphasis added\]

### Instructions to staff on forging the quotations

19     While the plan to falsify the quotations had been Mr Cheow’s brainchild, it was his spouse, Ms Kuan who had played a principal role in teaching _Buildforms Construction_ admin staff the operational methodology to effect these forgeries for quotations pertaining to star rate works. To this end, she had instructed them to use soft-copy templated blank quotation forms, containing the letterhead of one of the companies specified above. These had been saved in computers owned by _Buildforms Construction_ in either _Microsoft_ Word or Excel formats. Within the template, admin staff had been trained to fill in the description of the star rate works, and then “_randomly_” enter a price that was higher than the price that _Buildforms Construction_ intended to quote for. The latter price had already been computed by the company’s project coordinator prior to the exercise, and duly notified to the admin staff member perpetrating the forgery, who would infill “_the fictitious quotes at a random higher price_”[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15) and forward these, along with _Buildforms Construction’s_ invariably lowest quotation to the Facilities Management Manager (FMM) company engaged at the time.

### Additional steps taken to enhance impression of authenticity

20     In perpetrating the forgeries, other steps were also taken to lend authenticity to the falsified quotations, for _E/S Cleaning_ and _Air Builder_, the admin staff printed out their company stamps, superimposed these company stamps on the falsified quotations and photocopied the entire document such that the company stamp would bear an appearance of being “_genuinely stamped on the falsified quotation_.” For _Gecko_ forgeries, Cheow and his admin staff had gone to a stationery shop to fabricate a company stamp bearing _Gecko’s_ name, and used the customised stamp as an imprimatur of Gecko’s corporate identity in the falsified _Gecko_ quotations.

### Simulated email correspondences between Buildforms Construction and the companies

21     The fact of the offences being deeply premeditated was made all the more evident than the further concerted bids by Mr Cheow to build a substratum of fraudulent paperwork of supporting correspondences. While some degree of substantiation by supporting documents was expected for the star rate works, Mr Cheow went to the extent of “_creating fake email accounts and falsify the email correspondence between Buildforms_ (Construction) _and the relevant companies in order to create the appearance that_ (the former) _had sourced for genuine quotations from the companies._”[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16) With the agreed division of labour, the instruction of admin staff on how the false email correspondences were to be created was delegated to his spouse, Ms Kuan.

22     Mr Cheow admitted, however, that he was the progenitor of the idea to use the fake email addresses, and where he had caused the creation of “_geckodesignw@gmail.com_” purporting to be Gecko’s authorised email address, and “_es.escm@gmailcom_”, purporting to be E/S cleaning’s authorised email address[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17). Mr Cheow has also directed the crafting of falsified email correspondence between _Buildforms Construction_ and these companies by using the created email addresses, to affect an appearance that his company had been making genuine efforts to obtain quotations from these companies.

### Facts relating to the proceeded s 420 Penal Code charges

23     The majority of the proceeded charges involve section 420 of the Penal Code, and characterise the nature of Mr Cheow’s cheating to involve his role in a dishonest deception to induce another to make a valuable security. For reference section 420 provides that:

> Whoever cheats and thereby **_dishonestly induces the person deceived_** to deliver any property to any person, or **_to make_**, alter or destroy the whole or any part of **_a valuable security_**, or anything which is signed or sealed, and which is capable of being converted _into a_ valuable security, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine.

> \[Emphasis added\]

24     It was the prosecution’s case[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18) (which the accused did not that dispute) that the concerned MHA departments had fallen prey to Mr Cheow and Ms Kuan’s conspiracy to deceive, and been by his dishonesty, induced into making, in each case, a valuable security, in the form of either a **_Purchase Order_** or a **_Work Instruction_** to _Buildforms Construction_ through _Logistics Construction_, which these relevant MHA department would not have done, had they not been so deceived by such manner of deception. There is no dispute as to the prosecution’s basis for deeming a Purchase Order or Work Instruction as a ‘_valuable security_’ within the meaning of section 420 of the Penal Code. In any case, Mr Cheow admits to the following[^19]:

> 37.    A Purchase Order and a Work Instruction each created a legal right for _Buildforms_ (_Construction_) to perform the star rate works as approved by the relevant MHA departments. **_By being issued the Purchase Order or Work Instruction_**, _Buildforms_ (_Construction_) **_was awarded the star rate work for work to commence, and had the right to be paid subsequently for the completed works._** Therefore, a Purchase Order and a Work Instruction are each a valuable security under the definition in s 30 of the Penal Code.

> \[Emphasis added\]

25     The proceeded charges had been in relation to events that had occurred between 5 January 2012 and 25 November 2014, with the methodology outlined above, and with the net result of the relevant MHA departments induced into believing that _Buildforms Construction_ submitted the lowest priced out of three quotations.

26     The details relating to the eight proceeded charges under s 420 of the Penal Code are set out below. This is a reproduction of the table in the Statement of Facts but with the quotation reference numbers and details of the purchase order omitted as these are not in contention. The point of interest would be the comparative quotations, which afford a view of how Mr Cheow and his confederates were able to make successful bids for each case. It is notable that some of the false bids are expressed with figures down to single digit dollars and cents (e.g. Air Builder $ 3 16**2**.**50**), which seemed likely to be a tactic to lend an air of authenticity to the forged quote.

28     For completeness, Mr Cheow’s spouse; Ms Kuan, pleaded guilty to three section cheating _simpliciter_ 417 Penal Code charges. [\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21)

### Taken into consideration (TIC) charges

29     Other than the ten proceeded charges mentioned in the Statement of Facts, it should be mentioned that Mr Cheow faced a further 52 charges that he had agreed to have taken into consideration. I have set out the full slate of charges, categorised by the commissioning MHA agency, to allow a more **_holistic_** appreciation of Mr Cheow’s conduct in relation to all admitted offences that might have a bearing in his sentencing. It is of course quite trite that charges that an accused person has consented to have taken into consideration (“TICs charges” in common usage) may have a bearing on the tariff of the sentence(s) imposed. This would particularly so where they suggest prolonged or persistent offending conduct, which was undoubtedly the case here.

30     The entire slate of 65 charges is set out below, with the ten proceeded charges highlighted in **_bold, italics_** and the three withdrawn charges (DAC-922483-2017, DAC-922561-2017 and DAC-922562-2017 having been struck- through as discharges amounting to acquittals (DATA) were granted at the conclusion of the proceedings. The remaining **_unhighlighted_** charges were those that Mr Cheow had agreed to have taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing:

### Antecedent history

31     The accused had no relevant prior criminal antecedents, with the sole entry in his criminal records being Mr Cheow being placed under a supervision order under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions Act) for a term of three years from 4 October 1994. Needless to say, this entry would not have had any bearing in Mr Cheow’s sentencing.

### Prosecution’s sentencing recommendation

32     I will now give a brief sketch of the prosecution’s and defence’s positions on sentence, with a more in-depth coverage of their submissions in the analysis later in these grounds. The prosecution had asked for a global term of 23 months’ imprisonment arguing that Mr Cheow’s acts amounted to a “_serious fraud against a government Ministry, perpetrated over a period of almost three years.”_[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22).

33     The prosecution also pointed out that the offended extended to an aggregate sum of $165,269.60 that _Buildforms Construction_ had obtained from Mr Cheow’s masterminding of the conspiracy where he had “_devised a dishonest scheme to submit fictitious quotations to various MHA departments for construction projects_”.[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23) The prosecution sough to justify their recommendation of 23-month global imprisonment term on four bases, that: [^24]

> (a)     General deterrence was the dominant sentencing consideration.

> (b)     There were multiple aggravating factors present.

> (c)     There was a lack of mitigating factors.

> (d)     The sentence sought was in line with the precedents and proportional to Mr Cheow’s criminality.

34     The prosecution proposed[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25) that the following sentences be imposed:

### Defence sentencing position

35     The defence’s position concentrated on there being certain extenuating circumstances behind Mr Cheow’s offending. The one receiving the most emphasis was Mr Cheow’s travails in fulfilling his obligation to provide competing quotations on a timely basis, and which had to comply within the contractually stipulated timelines. The defence averred that Mr Cheow’s company had been bound, pursuant to an oral sub-contract agreement, where it had been agreed between _Buildforms Construction_ and _Logistics Construction_ that the former would take over **_all_** the latter company’s rights and obligations undertaken by MHA Term Contract. The undertakings included _Logistics Construction’s_ “_obligation to source for quotations for star rate work, and pay liquidated damages to the MHA in the event of delay in submitting such quotations_.”[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26) Mr Cheow reported finding the terms to be rather oppressive and difficult to comply with, especially given that he had only seven days to produce the competing invoices, for works valued under $20 000. The defence contended that _Buildforms Construction_ initially attempted to prepare genuine quotations, but had been thwarted by the obduracy and sluggish response times of sub-contractors from whom quotes had been solicited[^27] :

> 17.    If Buildforms failed to submit three quotations within the stipulated time, the MHA was entitled to impose liquidated damages of S$50 per missing quotation per day.

> 18.    Of the ten Charges proceeded against our client, nine Charges were for works which cost less than S$20,000. For these nine Charges, Buildforms only had seven working days from the date of request to submit the quotations to the relevant MHA departments.

> 19.    In performing Buildforms’ obligations as Logistics’ sub-contractor under the MHA Term Contract, our client, through Buildforms, had initially attempted to obtain genuine quotations from other sub-contractors for star rate work.

> 20.    On numerous occasions, our client either personally requested or instructed Buildforms’ staff to request quotations from various sub-contractors, including Gecko Design & Woodworks Pte Ltd, Air Builder Pte Ltd and E/S Cleaning & Maintenance Enterprise.

> 21.    However, the various sub-contractors did not always respond, particularly where the work requested was of low value. **_This put immense pressure on Buildforms and our client to submit the quotations within the time period stipulated under the MHA Term Contract, or risk paying liquidated damages._** Further, the low value of the work (see paragraph 18 above) meant that liquidated damages, if imposed, would have a significant and deleterious effect on the profitability of each contract.

> 22.     **_In order to avoid late submission of the quotations and becoming liable to pay liquidated damages, our client prepared fictitious quotations of other companies to be submitted together with Buildforms’ own quotation for star rate work under the MHA Term Contract_**.

> \[Emphasis added\]

### Disgorgement of benefits by Buildforms Construction

36     Another aspect which the defence put forward as being a mitigatory point was that of Mr Cheow having made charitable contributions amounting to the entire value of the works awarded to _Buildforms Construction_, which was in the region of $165,000. Counsel averred that Mr Cheow had made charitable contributions in the sum of S$165,000 to the following three charities[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28):

> (a)     Singapore Cancer Society — $55 000;

> (b)     Singapore Children’s Society — $55 000; and

> (c)     Dementia Singapore Ltd — $55 000.

37     The defence emphasized that these charitable contributions for the full value of the works had been made notwithstanding that _Buildforms Construction_ had completed all works awarded “_to each MHA department’s satisfaction”_ with _“no issue_ (raised) _of poor work quality_”[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29). This would, the defence submitted, demonstrate that neither Mr Cheow nor _Buildforms Construction_ had retained any benefit from his criminal activity. The defence also asserted that this was “_not a belated gesture_”, as Mr Cheow had been “_genuinely remorseful_” and had already offered to make full restitution “_shortly after the charges were first brought_”. [^30]

### Competing recommendation on sentence by the defence

38     Urging the court to take into consideration their iteration of the situation that Mr Cheow had faced at the material time, the defence gave their own perspective on the appropriate range of sentences to be imposed[\[note: 31\]](#Ftn_31):

## Analysis of Sentencing Considerations

### General deterrence

39     The prosecution had taken the stance that due regard ought be accorded to the fact that the ‘victims’ had been departments within the Ministry of Home Affairs. In their submissions, the prosecution had emphasized that **_general deterrence_** should take a primary role in sentencing. In this regard, the prosecutors referenced the case of _Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> (“_Law Aik Meng_”)[^32], to show that Mr Cheow’s manner of offending occurred in a situation mandating such treatment. In _Law Aik Meng_, VK Rajah had specified several categories of offending situations and factual matrices where general deterrence should play a prominent role in sentencing. The first of the categories related to offences against public institutions[^33]:

> 24     **_General deterrence aims to educate and deter other like-minded members of the general public by making an example of a particular offender_**: _Meeran bin Mydin v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 1 SLR(R) 522</span> at \[9\] (“_Meeran bin Mydin_”). Premeditated offences aside, there are many other situations where general deterrence assumes significance and relevance. These may relate to the type and/or circumstances of a particular offence. Some examples of the types of offences, which warrant general deterrence are:

>> **_Offences against or relating to public institutions_**, such as the courts, **_the police and the civil service:_** In _Meeran bin Mydin_, the appellant bribed an immigration officer at Woodlands Checkpoint by giving him money to procure social visit passes to enable various Indonesian nationals to enter Singapore via the checkpoint. A deterrent sentence was imposed by the court. Further, in _Mohammed Zairi bin Mohamad Mohtar v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 SLR(R) 211</span> (“_Mohammed Zairi_”), the appellants were prison guards who were found to have abused the prisoners under their watch; Yong CJ was of the view that a clear message had to be sent that prison brutality would not be condoned under any circumstances

>> \[Emphasis added\]

40     This principle had also recently found expression in the case of _Public Prosecutor v Koh Seah Wee and another_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGHC 240</span> (“_Koh Seah Wee_”), which has some (but not complete) parallels with the instant case. The victim was the Singapore Land Authority (“SLA”) and the accused persons had been the department’s own employees from their Technology and Infrastructure department. In that instance, the errant employees “_had siphoned off SLA’s funds stealthily and systematically over a number of years_” [^34] by the fraudulent procurement of goods and services using falsified purchase orders, which were put up by one of the accused persons, and approved by the other, causing SLA to pay fictitious vendors more than $12.1 million.

41     Tay Yong Kwang J (as he then was) had emphasized the need to take a strict stance where the offences had been committed against public institutions and implicated public funds. I note, of course, that the pronouncement below includes aggravation where the offence had been committed by an insider. Notwithstanding this, the proposition of imposing commensurably severe sentences where **_both_** public funds and institutions were involved was one which plainly had general applicability to this genera of offending.[\[note: 35\]](#Ftn_35)

> 57     **_Offences involving public funds committed against public institutions_** **_have to be dealt with sternly_** **_as they amount to an assault on the common weal and undermine good administration_**. It is worse when such assaults come from within the organisation and are initiated by people trusted to handle public funds and to ensure fair play in commercial dealings with the organisation. **_Fraud which is carefully planned and coolly played out is often difficult to uncover even with good checks and balances_**. It becomes even more elusive when there is collaboration and collusion from within the organisation defrauded.

> \[Emphasis added\]

42     The primacy of general deterrence as a sentencing position was made abundantly clear by Yong Pung How CJ _in Dong Guitian v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGHC 92</span> (“_Dong Guitian_”). The case involved a fraudulent scheme to induce the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) to grant Prior Approval Certificates to facilitate the offender’s recruitment of more foreign workers. The following passage is salient in elucidating on two distinct considerations at play in this case, and is thus reproduced in full:

> 40     **_As rightly pointed out by the trial judge_**, **_the principle of deterrence ought to be a dominant consideration_** **_in this case, as the deception had been perpetrated against a Government department responsible for controlling the recruitment of foreign labour in Singapore._** I noted in _Lim Mong Hong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 3 SLR(R) 88</span> that **_the courts generally adopt a harsh approach in cheating cases when the victim is a Government department or agency_**. This is done not out of cronyism, but rather to safeguard our national resources: _Xia Qin Lai v PP_ \[1999\] 3 SLR(R) 257. Counsel for the appellant maintained that the case of _Lim Mong Hong_ should not be relied on as a justification for giving the appellant a harsher sentence, as the Government department in question here (_i.e_. MOM) did not in fact suffer any financial loss. On the particular circumstances of this case, there was no doubt in my mind that from a public policy point of view, the appellant’s argument in this regard had to fail. **_It was true that MOM had not suffered any immediate and tangible financial loss_**. However, there was no denying that the appellant’s act of deception **_had frustrated the intention of the Singapore Government to effectively regulate and monitor the recruitment of foreign labour in Singapore._** In light of these facts, I was of the opinion that the trial judge could not be faulted for taking this aggravating factor into account in meting out the proper sentence.

> \[Emphasis added\]

### Frustration of a governmental intention to promote transparency in procurement processes

43     In _Dong Guitian_, there had been, beside the primary statement that “_the principle of deterrence ought to be a dominant consideration in this case, as the deception had been perpetrated against a government department_”, a second pronouncement that offences of this nature remained serious even where the government institution concerned “_had not suffered any immediate and tangible financial loss_”.

44     Both pronouncements would have major implications against Mr Cheow’s mitigation to having significantly expiated his wrongdoing by first having satisfactorily completed the works he had successfully obtained purchase orders for using the fraudulent quotations, **_and_** then having additionally made charitable contributions of a sum equivalent to the aggregate contracted sum for the works in the 62 charges.

45     Mr Cheow’s claim that he had not gained from his criminal acts must have also had the defence necessarily implying a _flip-side_ that tangible financial losses had not eventuated because the works had been properly completed, **_and_** any notional loss from the absence of true bids would have been addressed by his charitable contributions of a sum equivalent to that he had received for the entire works. It was implicit by nature of these payments that the contributions were not a direct restitution to the government. The defence nevertheless sought to show that Mr Cheow had by this gesture, disgorged any and all benefits of his acts, which also ran alongside their assertion that Mr Cheow “_did not personally profit from any of the works awarded to Buildforms_ (Construction)”[\[note: 36\]](#Ftn_36). There was of course no question in my mind that some benefit would ensue to stated public charitable causes from Mr Cheow’s contributions.

### Charitable contributions proffered after accused was aware he would likely face criminal consequences for his involvement by commissioning the forged quotations

46     Without taking anything away from the fact of the payments having actually been made, I would first note that Mr Cheow’s offer to make the charitable contributions had come **_after_** he had been charged, and where had become evident that a consequential accounting would be sought in a criminal court. It should be noted that the situation here was analogous to that in _Dong Guitian_, where the High Court had alluded to the need to be cognizant of higher considerations apart from the more readily calculable tangible financial losses, when fraudulent acts impacted governmental institutions. In _Dong Guitian_ the High Court had stressed considerations of public interest and policy in instructing on the need to “_adopt a harsh approach in cheating cases when the victim is a Government department or agency_”. Hence, while there had been no argument in _Dong Guitian_ that the Ministry of Manpower had not suffered any immediate and tangible financial loss, the perpetration of the criminal acts of deception by the accused had frustrated “_the intention of the Singapore government to effectively regulate and monitor the recruitment of foreign labour in Singapore_.”

47     There was, in my view, an analogous situation here with Mr Cheow’s acts amounting to a subversion of an established bidding process for government contracts that had been put in place to ensure transparency in process, and ensuring that public monies were prudently expended where the quantum paid for works or services had been tested by the application of market forces and competition inherent in the bidding process.

### Prosecution’s refutation of argument that no financial harm eventuated

48     The prosecution gave a succinct extrapolation of how the salient principles of _Dong Guitian_ were at play in this case, and that **_even_** the defence’s contention of an absence of financial harm was “_misconceived”_. [\[note: 37\]](#Ftn_37)

> 15.    First, MHA was likely to suffer financial harm as a result of the accused persons’ fraud. We explain:

>> (a)    In relation to the star rate works subject to the charges, Buildforms was obliged to source for and submit at least three genuine quotations made by three different, independent companies. [^38]

>> (b)    However, the accused persons instructed their Buildforms staff to submit fictitious quotations for the star rate works. For these fictitious quotations, the staff were taught by the accused persons to “randomly” enter a price higher than the price quoted by Buildforms.[^39] This was to ensure that Buildforms’ quoted price would be the lowest submitted to MHA department for the particular star rate work.

>> (c)    The rationale for requiring three quotations for star rate works was to ensure transparency and open competition in the procurement process.[^40] This was to ensure that MHA would obtain star rate works at the best value for money.

>> (d)    By creating and submitting the fictitious quotations as described above, there would be no transparency and open sourcing of genuine quotations. In this connection, the relevant MHA department was prevented from making a proper and reliable assessment of whether the works awarded were the best value for money. Put another way, if Buildforms genuinely sourced for independent quotations, there may have been lower priced quotations submitted that would offer MHA better value for money. In the premises, the accused persons’ deception was likely to cause harm to MHA in property.[^41]

>> (e)    Further, the fact that MHA utilises public funds to pay for the star rate works makes the accused persons’ offences more serious.

49     Returning to the notion of real _albeit_ non-readily calculable losses, DPP Edwin Soh submitted that Mr Cheow’s actions amounted to a subversion of processes put in place to ensure transparency and open competition in the procurement process for star rate works[\[note: 42\]](#Ftn_42), where the implementation of the system of calling for three competing quotations was “_the best means of ensuring that MHA to obtain star rate works at the best value for money because government funds involved_”. The purpose for this safeguard had been substantially defeated by Mr Cheow’s instructions to _Buildform Construction’s_ staff to submit fictitious quotations for the star rate works, with these randomly entered quotations for a higher price than _Buildform Construction’s_ own. This would subvert MHA’s goals of transparency in process, along with their ability to sense real market pricing that open-sourced genuine quotations would have afforded. Mr Cheow’s actions hence inhibited the ability of “_relevant MHA department involved_ (who) _would be prevented from making a proper and reliable assessment of what is the best value for money for them_”[^43] and thus eventuating in a frustration of a legitimate governmental process, which was the principal concern expressed in _Dong Guitian_.

### MHA has suffered forms of harm that cannot be readily calculated in financial terms

50     The learned DPP also underscored the consideration of “_other forms of harm that MHA suffered_” in sentencing. This aspect lay in the need to muster resources and effort to plug loopholes and weaknesses uncovered by the offending conduct. This point was clearly elucidated by the High Court in _Koh Seah Wee_, where had clear parallels with the instant case, with the offenders having siphoned off the Singapore Land Authority’s funds stealthily and systematically over a number of years from the fraudulent procurement of goods and services using falsified purchase orders, and upon which (then) Tay J had held[\[note: 44\]](#Ftn_44):

> 60     **_Financial crimes like these often have repercussions beyond the immediate facts of the case. New and more stringent checks may have to be introduced to try to prevent a repeat of the cheating. More levels of authorisation and authentication may have to be put in place_**. The result is increased costs in time, manpower and possibly infrastructure which would have been quite unnecessary if honesty prevails. There is the added dimension of creating disputes and litigation among those deceived…

> \[Emphasis added\]

51     It would stand to reason that Mr Cheow’s instances of breaches amounting to 62 occasions over a period of three years must have triggered intense corporate soul-searching, disquiet and concern over the integrity of their processes, which would translate to process improvements that one might envisage to include a more rigorous regime of checks and balances as a _prophylaxis_ to a recurrence of such falsification schemes. To make MHA a harder target, there likely be (per _Koh Seah Wee_ )“_more levels of authorisation and authentication_” which would concomitantly increase costs in time, manpower and infrastructural improvements. The reality of these additional costs must substantially take the figurative ‘_wind from the sails_’ of Mr Cheow’s claim of having, by his charitable contributions somehow made good on all losses that MHA might be assessed to have suffered.

### Cautious approach for ‘restitutions’ and other payments made in hope of a lighter sentence

52     The aforementioned consideration would apply even without raising the principle of the guarded approach generally taken for ‘_restitutions_’ made in apparent anticipation of a lighter sentence. In _Public Prosecutor v Ong Ker Seng_, <span class="citation">\[2001\] SGHC 263</span>, Yong Pung How CJ had expounded on the basis for wariness in factoring in such payments as a basis for a reduction of sentences:

> ...(W)**_here restitution is made in circumstances which may lead one to suspect that it was done in the hope of getting a lighter sentence, a sentencer will not give much credit for it_** (_Soong Hee Sin v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 1 SLR(R) 475</span>). As a matter of fact, in Soong’s case (at \[10\]) I said: “_If anything, such mindset appeared to me to demonstrate calculated purposefulness rather than genuine remorse on the appellant’s part_.” Similar principles should apply here as well. While full repayment of the loan was eventually made to Mr Law, the respondent should not be given full credit since **_the final repayment made_** to Mr Law **_was done under circumstances which led me to believe that it was made with calculated purposefulness in the hope of obtaining a lower sentence_**

## Offence specific factors

### The stages for evaluating sentence

53     In the case of _Logachev Vladislav_ v _Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 12</span> (“_Logachev Vladislav_”), Sundaresh Menon CJ had set out a systematic process to derive an appropriate sentence after considering, in specific stages. This would generally begin with the **_offence specific_** factors to derive a starting point for sentence, followed by a contemplation of **_offender-specific_** factors, where salient mitigatory or aggravating characteristics of the accused were evaluated. This is followed by refinements made to ensure that the run of consecutive sentences would yield an overall resultant sentence that fulfilled the principles of totality and proportionality, with the eventual sentences only pronounced after a ‘_last look_’ to be certain that the global sentence was just, not unduly crushing, and consonant with the offender’s rehabilitative prospects. A contemplation of offence-specific factors would entail an evaluation of a cross-matrix of **_harm_** and **_culpability_** factors.

### The essential parameters of harm and culpability

54     The starting point for any analysis on sentence would invariably entail an exercise by the sentencing court in engaging the two principal parameters of **_harm_** and **culpability** in the evaluation of the gravity of the criminal act(s) concerned. As See Kee Oon J explained in _Public Prosecutor v Koh Thiam Huat_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 123</span>[^45]

> 41    …(T)he two principal parameters which a sentencing court would generally have regard to in evaluating the seriousness of a crime are: (a) the _harm_ caused by the offence; and (b) the accused’s _culpability_. “**_Harm” is a measure of the injury which has been caused to society by the commission of the offence, whereas “culpability” is a measure of the degree of relative blameworthiness disclosed by an offender’s actions_** and is measured chiefly in relation to the extent and manner of the offender’s involvement in the criminal act.

55     In _Logachev Vladislav_, the honourable Chief Justice had elucidated on a set of **_culpability_** factors that would be applicable for cheating-related criminal acts. Although _Logachev Vladislav_ involved acts of cheating at play punishable under section 172A(2) of the Casino Control Act (Cap 33A, 2007 Rev Ed), these factors are regarded to be universally applicable to analyse aggravating elements in cheating and other offences connected with dishonest acts involving property. An analysis would show Mr Cheow’s offending would have encompassed all five headings listed in the reproduced passage. In _Logachev Vladislav_, his Honour had expressed the following views in this aspect[\[note: 46\]](#Ftn_46):

> (1)     _The degree of planning and premeditation_

> 56    I now turn to the offence-specific factors that go towards the offender’s culpability. All other things being equal, an offence committed with planning and premeditation will be more aggravated than one which is committed opportunistically or on impulse … **_The presence of planning and premeditation evinces a considered commitment towards law-breaking and therefore reflects greater criminality_**… As Prof Andrew Ashworth explains in _Sentencing and Criminal Justice_ (Cambridge University Press, 6th Ed, 2015) (at p 171):

>> … **_A person who plans a crime is generally more culpable, because the offence is premeditated and the offender is therefore more fully confirmed in his criminal motivation than someone who acts on impulse, since he is more considered in his lawbreaking._** … Planned lawbreaking betokens a considered attack on social values, with greater commitment and perhaps continuity than a spontaneous crime.

> (2)     _The level of sophistication_

> 57    All other things being equal, an offence committed by sophisticated means will be more aggravated than one which is committed simplistically. In _Fernando_ (\[41\] _supra_), the court observed (at \[42\]):

>> … A sophisticated offence replete with carefully-orchestrated efforts and steps to avoid detection is an aggravating factor in sentencing. … Conversely, where an offence is relatively unsophisticated and minimal precautions are taken to avoid detection, a comparatively lower sentence would generally be imposed …

> 58     **_The level of sophistication of the offence encompasses considerations including the complexity and scale of the criminal operation in question_**. …As noted in the passage quoted above, it is also closely related to the question of the difficulty of detection, which was considered in _Yongyut_ (at \[190(iii)\]) and _Lim Boon Kwang_ (at \[5\]), as well as by the District Judge (see the GD at \[26\]).

> (3)     _The duration of offending_

> 59    All other things being equal, an offence perpetrated over a sustained period of time will be more aggravated than a one-off offence. **_The duration of offending indicates how determined the offending conduct is, and is also tied to the notion of specific deterrence_**. As the court observed in _Fernando_ (at \[43\]):

>> The length of time a particular scam or offence has gone undetected would be yet another relevant consideration in sentencing. … The relevance of this … as a sentencing consideration may also be tied to the recalcitrance of the offender. In the case of a hardened offender, he would have repeatedly committed a pattern of offences without any sign or acknowledgment of contrition or remorse. _The longer the period of time over which the offences have been committed, the more irrefutable it is that the offender manifests the qualities of a habitual offender. Specific deterrence is incontrovertibly an important sentencing consideration in such cases._ \[emphasis added\]

> (4)     _The offender’s role_

> 60     The offender’s role is a factor that is especially relevant where the offence in question involves a syndicate. All other things being equal, **_an offender who is higher up in the syndicate’s hierarchy will_**, by virtue of his position, be more culpable than an offender who occupies a position at the lower rungs..

> (5)     _Abuse of position and breach of trust_

> 62    Where there is an abuse of position and breach of trust, this will aggravate the offence …

> \[Emphasis added\]

### The accused’s offending encompassed all the aggravating culpability factors set out in Logachev Vladislav

56     Succinctly put, Mr Cheow’s offending involved meticulous **_premeditation and planning_****_[\[note: 47\]](#Ftn_47)_** to advance a highly **_sophisticated_** scheme[^48]. To recapitulate, this had involved the crafting of fictitious invoices with falsified letterheads from _Gecko_, _E/S Cleaning_ and _Air Builder_. Mr Cheow’s staff had been specially trained to create these invoices, company stamps had been created, and even email chains fabricated to lend a simulacrum of authenticity. The offences had also spanned no less than three years, from January 2012 to November 2014[^49]. Mr Cheow had admitted to being the **_controlling mind_**[^50] of the scheme, with his wife simply an accessory to performing his bidding in training staff. This dichotomy in role and function was also evidently a factor to Ms Kuan facing just three relatively minor charges where fines were recommended by the prosecution as appropriate punishment. Mr Cheow’s company_, Buildforms Construction_, having formally assumed all undertakings of _Logistics Construction_, was placed in the advantageous and trusted position of sourcing for competing quotations. Mr Cheow had chosen to **_abuse_**[^51] this trust by **_gaming_** the system to ensure he would be the sole genuine bidder, and thus be assured that he would land any job assigned at a price he decided.

### The analytical approach taken here and the subsequent holding by the High Court in PP v Tan Wen Jie

57     Section 420 of the Penal Code, of course, carries a mandatory custodial penalty. To this end, I had based my computation on the appropriate imprisonment term on two bases. The **_first_** was to resort to a sentencing framework propounded in a District Court in the case of _PP_ v _Gene Chong Soon Hui_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 117</span> (“_Gene Chong_”).

58      _In Gene Chong_, a framework had been developed for cheating offences under section 420 of the Penal Code. This had been an extrapolation of the framework set out by the High Court in _Logachev Vladislav_, which had involved offences under section 172A(2) of the Casino Control Act (Cap 33A, 2007 Rev Ed).

59     This extrapolation was intended to allow for the full expression of the sentencing spectrum to the maximum **_seven_**\-year term provided for section 172A(2) of the Casino Control Act to the **_ten_**\-year maximum imprisonment term specified under section 420 of the Penal Code. This framework had been used in a number of preceding first instance cases by District Judges imposing sentences on cheating charges.

60     My **_second_** basis had been to **_compare_** Mr Cheow’s offending with the sentences imposed in cases with similar factual matrices on the essential aspects of large scale and/or high quantum cheating perpetrated against a governmental body or where state funds or revenue were lost or places at risk in the course of the criminal activity. I should add that a consultation of the framework was only to obtain a **_preliminary_** sense of the sentencing range, with the juxtaposition of cheating cases with relevant parallels in manner and circumstances of offending, being the **_principal_** means of pin-pointing the appropriate sentences.

###    What the High Court in PP V Tan Wen Jie held

61     Mr Cheow was sentenced to the global term of 19 months’ imprisonment on 29 October 2021, and filed his appeal against sentence on 2 November 2021. Subsequently, on 25 January 2022, a decision of the High Court was pronounced which would have implications to the approach described in the foregoing. This was the case of _Public Prosecutor v Tan Wen Jie_[\[note: 52\]](#Ftn_52) (’_Tan Wen Jie”_) where Vincent Hoong J, in an _ex-tempore_ judgment, held[^53]:

> …I am of the view that it would be inappropriate to rely on (_PP_ v _Gene Chong’s proposed s 420 Penal Code_ )framework in the present case. Given the diverse factual scenarios in which a s 420 PC offence may present itself, recourse to a single general sentencing framework may lead to unjust outcomes with insufficient consideration for the unique facts of each case. For this reason, **_I am of the view that_** **_the better approach_** **_in the present case is to have regard to_** **_analogous precedents with similar fact patterns_** **_in arriving at a fair sentence_**.

> \[Emphasis added\]

62     Given the clear pronouncement by the High Court that the preferred approach for analysis cheating cases should be an examination of preceding cases with analogous fact patterns, I will **_not_** delve any further into the _Gene Chong_ framework in these grounds, save to reproduce this for reference, given that defence counsel had made frequent references to the framework in their submissions, and given that I had preliminarily taken note of it (principally to **_visualise_** the spread of the sentencing spectrum along and across the ten-year maximum term provided for under section 420 of the Penal Code, in a graphical cross-matrix) in the process of rendering my decision, which of course pre-dated the High Court’s pronouncement in _Tan Wen Jie_. The _Gene Chong_ framework is set out below for **_reference_** only:

### Corelation between incidence of offending and quantum of gain with harm and culpability

63     For cheating and like-offences involving dishonest gain from deceptive conduct, a universally applicable metric for obtaining a rough **_gauge_** of both culpability and harm could be afforded by a computation of the number of offences, as well as the quantum of gain by the offender. This was elucidated upon by (then) VK Rajah J _in Public Prosecutor v Fernando Payagala Waduge Malitha Kumar_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGHC 23</span>, in the context of credit card fraud[^54]:

> 46    As both a matter of common sense and general principle, it **_can be said that the larger the number of offences committed, the longer the custodial sentence_**. The application of this principle in credit card offences is amply illustrated by _Mihaly Magashazie[^55]_, where the court concluded that the numerous fraudulent purchases made by the accused justified the imposition of longer custodial sentences. The massive number of charges in _Rohaazman bin Ali[^56]_ also proved to be a relevant consideration for the court in sentencing.

> 47    With respect to quantum, **_it can also be generally surmised that the higher the quantum, the heftier the sentence_** (see Lee Teck Leng in “Sentencing in Cheating Offences”, _Law Gazette_, August 2000 at 23 (“_Law Gazette Article_”)). That the sentencing tariffs for cheating offences under s 420 are based on the quantum in each charge is well illustrated in the _Law Gazette Article_. In my view, this applies across the board to all s 420 cheating offences, _including_ credit card offences.

64     This principle of connecting the value of property involved in cheating-related offences with the severity of the sentence to be imposed was reinforced in the more recent case of _Gan Chai Bee Anne_ v _Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 42</span> (“_Gan Chai Bee_”), where Sundaresh Menon CJ, in referencing _Fernando Payagala_ reiterated[^57]:

> 42    There is a well-established general principle that in sentencing for financial and property offences, the greater the economic value involved in the offence, the heavier the sentence …**_The rationale for this is that economic value is a proxy for the degree of criminal benefit received by the offender and the degree of harm caused to the victim, and both are relevant sentencing considerations_**…

### The approach used

65     Following the above pronouncements, the proper approach would be to assess the nature and extent of Mr Cheow’s offending within the parameters of the number of charges he faced against the value of the assigned projects he had been awarded as a result of the fraud perpetrated by the invoices, with a close **_juxtaposition_** of analogous precedents with similar fact patterns, to derive sentences appropriate as condign punishments.

### Comparison with PP v Tan Wen Jie in assessing sentence

66     Within the milieu of sentencing decisions with close parallels in their factual matrices with the instant case, particularly in genres of fraud impacting government institutions, the case of _Tan Wen Jie_ occupies a special position of being the only case where the sentences imposed have been explicitly endorsed by appellate approval. In the _ex-tempore_ judgment in _Tan Wen Jie_, Vincent Hoong J had cited two other unreported first instance cases as “useful reference points” in sentencing for this particular **_genre_** of cases, while rejecting other cases proposed by the defence[\[note: 58\]](#Ftn_58):

> 4    In this regard, the appellant has cited a number of sentencing precedents to assist the court. However, I find that those cases involved different factual matrices and are thus of limited relevance to the present case. Nevertheless, **_the Prosecution has cited two unreported first instance decisions namely_** _PP v Leong Weng Cheou_ and _PP v Zheng Zhenwei Eric_, **_which concern_** **_similar situations where the offenders cheated government authorities/ agencies by deceiving them into disbursing public funds_****_. While such unreported and unreasoned decisions should be treated with some caution_**, **_I nevertheless find that they serve as useful reference points in the sentencing analysis_****_._**

> \[Emphasis added\]

### Analysis of similar situations of cheating affecting government agencies and the disbursement of public monies

67     Pursuant to the observation by Hoong J, the latter part of these grounds will demonstrate that the three cases cited above; _Public Prosecutor v Tan Wen Jie_, _Public Prosecutor v Leong Weng Cheou_ (_Leong Weng Cheou_) and _Public Prosecutor v Zheng Zhenwei Eric_ (_Eric Zheng_), all have close parallels with the instant case, being complex frauds perpetrated against governmental agencies, and which concerned public monies being taken or caused to be misapplied.

68     The analysis that subsequently follows will also establish that the sentences imposed on Mr Cheow were entirely consonant with the sentences received by the offenders in these three cases. Indeed, if anything, Mr Cheow’s sentence would have been very much at the **_low_** end of the range of sentences imposed, despite possessing many similar aggravating factors. For comparison, the offender in _Leong Weng Cheou_ received a global term of 48 months’ imprisonment, _Eric Zheng_; 36 months’ imprisonment, and _Tan Wei Jie_; a term of 26 months’ and two weeks’ imprisonment.

### The facts of PP v Tan Wen Jie

69     Mr Tan had pleaded guilty to six proceeded charges, arising from three sets of paired charges for one section 420 Penal Code offence and one charge under section 28(1) of the Regulation of Imports and Exports Act (Cap 272A, Rev Ed 1996), which were connected with his dealings with the same three cars, where he had in a conspiracy with one _Lee Wui Liang_, cheated the Land Transport Authority by facilitating in the **_fabrication_** of Bills of Lading and Cargo Clearance Permits to show that the involved vehicle had been exported even as these vehicles **_remained_** in Singapore, and inducing LTA to deliver a Preferential Additional Registration Fee (PARF) rebates for the vehicles, with the highest rebate, and consequential loss amounting to $40,712[\[note: 59\]](#Ftn_59), and $18,396[^60] for the lowest. Along with the three proceeded section 420 Penal Code charges, Mr Tan agreed to, _inter alia_, the taking into consideration another five cheating charges for offences involving other vehicles where he had used the same _modus operandi_.

70     As mentioned above, the offender in _Tan Wen Jie_ received a global sentence of **_26 months’ and two weeks’_** imprisonment derived from the run of **_three_** consecutive sentences. The constituent charges which ran consecutively would be two cheating charges; DAC-913799-2020 and DAC-907773-2019 and, where individual imprisonment terms of **_15 months_** and **_11 months_** were respectively imposed for causing incurred losses of **$40,712** and **$18,396** in each case, along with a single charge under the Regulation of Imports and Exports Act[\[note: 61\]](#Ftn_61), where a term of two weeks' imprisonment was imposed. The consecutive sentences are drawn, one each, from criminal acts connected with each of the three cars[^62] featured in the proceeded charges. The three other proceeded charges were ordered to run concurrently.

71     For completeness, _Tan Wen Jie’s_ co-accused[\[note: 63\]](#Ftn_63), the aforementioned _Lee Wui Liang_, received corresponding terms of imprisonment of 18 months[^64], 13 months[^65] and 12 months[^66] for his complicity in the fraudulent acts perpetrated in respect of these same three cars, within a global sentence of imprisonment for a term of three years, 30 months and two weeks, along with a fine, on 22 June 2019. The offender in _PP v Lee Wui Liang_, who had a criminal history and faced additional unrelated charges, did not appeal against the imposed sentence, and hence no further guidance can be gleaned from this related case.

### The facts of PP v Leong Weng Cheou

72     In _Public Prosecutor_ v _Leong Weng Cheou_ \[DAC-939984-2018 and others\] _[\[note: 67\]](#Ftn_67)_, the offender; age 46 was a senior executive at SPRING Singapore (“SPRING”), a statutory board now known as Enterprise SG, and had fraudulently manipulated a scheme operated by SPRING for his own benefit. The said scheme involved the issuance of Innovation and Capability Vouchers (“ICV”) which were in blocs of $5,000 given by SPRING, to small and medium-sized enterprises to encourage these entities to develop their capabilities in the five strategic areas of innovation, productivity, human resource, financial management and solutions.

73     The offender in _Leong Weng Cheou_ had engaged in four separate conspiracies with each of his four friends to register multiple shell business entities, which were generally sole proprietorships, and to forge supporting documents for the singular purpose of submitting fictitious ICV applications and claims to obtain the ICV monetary pay-outs. The collusion entailed _Leong_ teaching his four friends how to register the shell entities with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority, and also in accessing genuine supporting documents from SPRING’s computer systems and fraudulently editing these to create convincing forged documents. The offender in _Leong Wen Cheou_ had also lent an insider’s helping hand to intentionally select some fraudulent applications that he or the co-accused persons had submitted and used his official position to assess these favourably, in a bid to increase the likelihood of their being approved.

74     In all, the offender in _Leong Weng Cheou_ was responsible for the scheme’s disbursement of grants worth a total of **$154,999.63** through 31 fraudulent ICV applications. _Leong_ as the undisputed mastermind of the scheme, had faced 31 cheating changes under section 420 Penal Code read with section 109 of the Code. The offender also faced 104 charges under section 468 of Penal Code, for the forgery of documents to enable the 31 fraudulent ICV applications. It was notable too that _Leong_, who received a global term of 48 months’ imprisonment from a run of six consecutive sentence, eventually made full restitution to SPRING. It would also be of note that the offender received individual sentences of **_eight months’_** imprisonment for each of the cheating charges which involved quanta of $**5000** defrauded from the State.

### Comparison between PP v Leong Weng Cheou and the present case

75     There is a general parity of **_status_** in this case between the role of the offenders, as Mr Cheow was unquestionably also the mastermind behind the operation. There is also a rough parity between the quanta taken by the two men, as Mr Cheow in defrauding three different MHA departments ( being the SPF, HTA and ICA) had amassed an aggregate **$165,269.60** from 62 charges. _Leong_ had defrauded **$154,999.63** through 31 sham ICV applications.

76     Having stated the above, I would not entirely agree with the prosecution’s view that “_It cannot be said that Leong’s overall criminality is higher than Cheow’s_.”[\[note: 68\]](#Ftn_68) I was of the view that the manner of _Leong’s_ offending was more egregious. This was evident from the fact that he (_Leong_) had been, _ab initio_ been motivated by greed. This this differed from the characterisation of Mr Cheow’s motivation **_at the outset_**, as expressed in the Joint Statement of Facts, which spoke of his anxiety in attracting liquidated damages if he failed to procure the stipulated competing quotations on time.

77     Of course, given the **_three-year_** span of Mr Cheow’s offending, his intent to secure illicit material gain would have conceivably evolved to become the **_primary_** motivator over time, as it would have been rational for the accused to renegotiate the time frame for delivering the quotations with MHA if the ones contractually imposed were oppressively difficult to carry out, and if his true intent were to conduct honest business with the MHA departments.

78     This consideration would form one of the bases why Mr Cheow’s eventual sentences were relatively **_lower_**, when set against the denomination of quantum involved in each charge. Hence while _Leong_ had received eight months’ imprisonment for each charge involving fraudulent activity causing a loss of $5000, Mr Cheow’s **_eventual_** sentences were proportionately **_lower_** at three months’ imprisonment for a fraud involving $3 750[\[note: 69\]](#Ftn_69) and 13 months’ imprisonment where the fraud had induced a purchase order of 43 700[^70]. The latter instance would represent a sentence which was **1.6** times higher than the eight-month sentence meted out in _Leong Weng Cheou_ where the quantum was some **8.7** times higher than the $5000 involved in _Leong_.

### The facts of PP v Eric Zheng

79     The last of the three cases that were referred to by Vincent Hoong J in the oral judgment that affirmed the sentence imposed in _PP v Tan Wen Jie_ was _Public Prosecutor v Zheng Zhenwei Eric_, which I have abbreviated in reference as _Eric Zheng’s_ case. The offender there had pleaded guilty 30 charges comprising 14 counts of cheating under section 420 read with section 109 of the Code for conspiring with two others to cheat Workforce Development Agency (WDA)[\[note: 71\]](#Ftn_71); along with another 14 counts of cheating for instigating various individuals into submitting false claims under the Skills Future Credit (SFC) scheme; and two counts under s. 417 Penal Code for submitting false attendance records to WDA during a surprise audit.

80     The offender in _Eric Zheng_ had developed a plan to defraud the SFC scheme using his company, _Biz HR_, and had roped two acquaintances, to recruit ‘trainees’ for courses purportedly run by _Biz HR_. The ‘trainees’ either did not attend the courses, or no such courses were held in the first place. In the former arrangement, the three persons in the conspiracy would prepare false invoices and attendance sheets and induce the ‘trainees’ to pre-sign them, with all three meeting the recruited ‘trainees’ to assist them with the submission their claims. The scheme eventuated with the WDA being defrauded by an aggregate sum of $73,980, which was delivering to _Biz HR_.

81     In _Eric Zheng_, sentences of six months’ imprisonment were meted for 29 of the 30 proceeded charges, with a four-month term imposed on the final section 417 Penal Code charge as a concurrent term. Six sentences were ordered to run consecutively, yielding an aggregate sentence of 36 months’ imprisonment. It should again be noted that the ratio of loss for each charge against the sentence imposed was far more **_severe_** for _Eric Zheng_ than in the instant case. In _Eric Zheng_, the loss in each instance would have been the sum of between $230 and $250 that the WDA had paid for each trainee recruited, as against the six-month sentence that the offender had received for each charge.

### Why the three cases are highly significant

82     The reason for the detailed discussion of the three cases in these Grounds lies in the fact of their **_endorsement_** by Justice Hoong as valid reference points for sentencing in the Magistrate’s Appeal[\[note: 72\]](#Ftn_72) for _Tan Wen Jie_ for this genre of cheating offences involving government processes or programmes and the use of public monies. Without this affirmation, the general principle that would apply is that “_unreported cases carry little if any precedential value because they are unreasoned_”, as expressed in _Public Prosecutor_ v S_iow Kai Yuan Terrence_ \[2020\] SGHC[^73]. I should, at this juncture, clarify that my sentencing decision for Mr Cheow’s case was rendered in November 2021, **_before_** the High Court’s explicit endorsement of the analysis of sentence of _Tan Wen Jie_, using the sentences meted in two unreported cases: _Leong Weng Cheou_ and _Eric Zheng_, as reference points in January 2022.

83     Even though the MA decision was **_subsequent_** to my case, I should make it clear that I had applied these three cases to my mind **_when_** sentencing Mr Cheow. This would only be natural as _Tan Wen Jie_ had also been a case that I had dealt with at **_first_** instance, and the Grounds of Decision I had written upon the accused’s appeal was fresh to my mind[\[note: 74\]](#Ftn_74). I should add that _Tan Wen Jie_ was also extensively referenced in the Mitigation Plea[^75] filed by the defence, with the case exhibited in their Bundle of Authorities.

### Comparative Table between the present case and PP v Tan Wen Jie, PP n Leong Weng Cheou and PP v Eric Zheng

84     The following table[\[note: 76\]](#Ftn_76) allows a comparison of the cases discussed above, and affords a side-by-side juxtaposition of salient aspects of the respective cases.

### Analysis of present case in comparison with preceding similar-genre cases

85     The comparison would show salient parallels between the three referenced decisions and the present case, with patent similarities in aggravating factors such as the fact of significant premeditation, as demonstrated by pains-taking preparations for the schemes, along with meticulous planning and recruitment of associates to operationalise their respective schemes. One striking **_difference_** however was that while schemes in three of the cases were absolute scams that returned no **_value_** to the taxpayer, Mr Cheow’s differed in the sense that his company _Buildforms Construction_ did **_perform_** the works assigned for the MHA agencies, and there had been no complaint of the quality of the works or services rendered by the accused’s company. There was of course still considerable harm that eventuated, not least by the taxpayer paying for goods and services within a closed-looped uncompetitive environment that Mr Cheow had created, and also the concomitant public disquiet from knowing that such processes had been subverted. This being the case, I was of the view that an appropriate adjustment of the initial sentencing position (before considering offender-specific factors) should be taken, particularly from the sentences imposed in _Leong Weng Cheou_ and _Eric Zheng_.

### Setting appropriate starting points for sentencing

86     I had referenced High Court’s pronouncement in _Gan Chai Bee__[\[note: 81\]](#Ftn_81)_ earlier in these grounds as authority for the principle that there ought be a close co-relationship between economic value involved in the offence and the severity of the sentence for financial and property offences, with actual or notional financial loss becoming a proxy for harm in such crimes. In that case, the Honourable Chief Justice had also emphasized the importance of rigorously and sequentially following two distinct steps of sentencing analysis for such cases. The first of these steps entailed the court’s determination of the appropriate sentence for **_each_** charge, with the second calling for the court’s contemplation of the **_overall_** sentence to be imposed.[^82] This second step concerned not only the issue of how the sentences ought be run, but also whether the **_totality_** of the offender’s conduct justified an adjustment in the individual sentences decided at the first step.

### Positioning a sentencing range in a case where the amount involved in the cheating activity is a useful reference point but is not the same as the amount actually gained by the offender

87     In assessing the run of sentences from the table, it should be noted that the global sentences for _Leong Weng Cheou_ and _Eric Zheng_ at 48 months’ and 36 months’ imprisonment are very much higher than either the sentence proposed by the prosecution against Mr Cheow, of 23 months’ imprisonment, or the sentence he eventually received; of an aggregate term of 19 months’ imprisonment. There is, in my view, a basis to draw an appropriate distinction in sentencing between cases where the **_entire_** sum specified within the charges is the amount actually **_taken_** by the accused in the course of his offending, and in cases where the stated sum only represented the sum of contracted works which were **_affected_**, or otherwise tainted, by the criminal activity.

88     The latter situation was, of course, the case here. It is beyond dispute that Mr Cheow did not brazenly cheat the sum of $165 269.60 from the 62 charges **_wholesale_**, but had created a situation where the monetary loss he had caused by his fraudulent acts can never be accurately ascertained, as no genuine quotations exist to set any **_context_** with the amounts that _Buildforms Constructions_ had billed for their works_._ Notwithstanding this, while the actual economic harm has been rendered nebulous by the accused own acts, the sum of $165 269.60 is relevant as a proxy for reputational and other harm in the Mr Cheow has caused, not least by the considerable public disquiet that would have been caused by the community realising that such an **_extensive_** fraud had been perpetrated against public institutions entrusted to maintain law and order in our country.

### The prosecution’s approach to consecutive sentencing appeared calibrated to the specific nature of offending

89     This distinction was quite evident by the prosecution’s sentencing position where a global sentence of 23 months’ imprisonment from a consecutive run of **_three_** sentences. This should be considered against the fact that both _Leong Weng Cheou_ and _Eric Zheng_ had seen the imposition of **_six_** consecutive sentences. I also noted a measure of moderation in their selection of the three charges for consecutive sentence. One was, expectedly, the charge for the highest sum paid out of $43,700, where a 16-month imprisonment term was mooted. The other two charges involved cheating of far more modest sums for purchase orders of $3350 and $2850, where the prosecution had eschewed asking for much higher a charge involving the purchase order of $8100 to be included in the grouping of consecutive sentences. The prosecution had continued with this principled approach in their sentencing recommendations which showed a graduated scale adjusted in accordance with the quantum involved. This is a graphical representation of their proposed schedule[\[note: 83\]](#Ftn_83):

90     The defence had asked for a different combination for consecutive sentencing, and had indeed mooted that two of the most serious charges (by quantum) run consecutively. This would be 48th Charge[\[note: 84\]](#Ftn_84), involving S$43,700, where a **_six-month_** imprisonment term had been recommended, along with the 26th Charge[^85], involving S$8,100, where a term of **_four months’_** imprisonment had been recommended. This would be rounded off by the 59th charge[^86], which was framed as a lesser section 417 Penal Code offence and involved a purchase order of $2 650, and where a **_two-week_** imprisonment term was suggested. The run of the three sentences would amount to a global sentence of ten months’ and two weeks’ imprisonment.

### Concordance on three consecutive sentences in this case

91     Looking at the particular circumstances of this case, particularly where the referenced sum of $165 269.60 represented the value of the contracts, rather than the amounts actually defrauded wholesale, which might well justify the run of six consecutive terms seen in _Leong Weng Cheou_ and _Eric Zheng_. I agreed that a run of three consecutive sentences was appropriate. The presenting conundrum was that parties had diametrically different views on the eventual sentence, with the prosecution’s formulation reaching a global term of **_23 months’_** imprisonment, where the defence, despite advocating the inclusion of a more serious charge, had derived one where Mr Cheow’s incarceration would be at ten months’ and two weeks’ imprisonment, which was under **_half_** of the prosecution’s recommendation.

92     For a perspective view, it would be practical at this point to look closer at the combinations of three sentences presented by both the prosecution and defence. I have therefore prepared a table the prosecution and defence’s proposed consecutively-run sentences in **_bold italics_**, which is set out below”

### Comment on defence’s sentencing proposal

93     My first observation would be that the defence’s proposal for their second highest sentence to be a term of **_four months’_** imprisonment for Mr Cheow’s quotation-based fraud on the purchase order awarded at $8100, could not be reconciled with their suggestion of a sentence of just **_six months’_** imprisonment for the most serious charge, which involved an **_exponentially_** higher sum of $43 700. With due respect, even if the four-month imprisonment recommendation was deemed acceptable, it would be untenable to propose a **_one-third_** increment on their recommended sentence where the quantum of the fraud involved a purchase order that was more than **_five times_** higher (i.e. $8 100 as against $43 700).

### Defence’s global sentence recommendation is incompatible with penalties meted in other cases of this genre

94     Aside from this artificial “_flat-lining_” of the **_gradient_** of the sentencing trajectory between the highest and second highest proposed sentences, I accepted the prosecution’s assertion that the proposed overall sentence of ten months’ and two weeks’ imprisonment was manifestly inadequate. In this regard, the prosecution had cited the sentences meted to non-mastermind offenders of this genre and noted that more severe sentences had been imposed. In _Public Prosecutor_ v _Soh Eng Luan_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 64</span> (“_Soh Eng Luan_”), the accused had been one of four accomplices of _Leong Weng Cheou_, and had pleaded guilty to two section 420 Penal Code charges, along with two forgery charges[^87] in respect of the fraudulent ICV applications to SPRING, which were mentioned earlier in these grounds. In all, the accused had caused $15 000 of loss to SPRING, and had personally gained just $7 500 from her criminal activities. There was no question that she had merely followed the directions of the mastermind; _Leong Wing Cheou_ himself_._

95     Upon an appeal by the prosecution,[\[note: 88\]](#Ftn_88) Aedit Abdullah J had increased the three-month imprisonment sentences in each of the four charges in _Soh Eng Luan_ to **_five_** months’ imprisonment per charge, with the offender receiving an aggregate 10-month imprisonment sentence. The prosecution[^89] made a valid point that Mr Cheow could not conceivably be receiving essentially the same global sentence, given his status as the mastermind of the scheme, the far higher amount involved, and the fact that the accused here had, prior to the plea arrangement, faced 62 charges to the 12 (three cheating and nine forgery charges) that the offender in _Soh Eng Luan_ had faced.

96     The prosecution also proposed to juxtapose[\[note: 90\]](#Ftn_90) Mr Cheow’s offences with the case of _Public Prosecutor v Teo Eu Gene[^91]_ (_“Teo Eu Gene_”). While there have been no appeal in that case, the facts were nevertheless of greater cogency to the instant case, as the offender there had not sought to perpetrate wholesale cheating, but had instead, in the midst of billing for **_actual_** dental work, **_also_** submitted fraudulent Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) claims to obtain subsidies from government polyclinics for other dental procedures he had not, in fact, undertaken. Dr Teo had pleaded guilty to 25 section 420 Penal Code charges, and agreed to have another two cheating, and 33 forgery charges taken into consideration. In all, the offender in _Teo Eu Gene_ and cheated the polyclinics into disbursing $40,486, of which $19,319 was for the non-existent dental procedures that Dr Teo had fraudulently claimed[^92]. The offender in this instance received 46 weeks’ imprisonment, which would translate to slightly under 11 months’ incarceration.

97      _Teo Eu Gene_ is notable from the **_parallels_** to the instant case which involves fraudulent acts perpetrated **_within_** an ostensibly legitimate course of a contracting party supplying goods or services to a government body and being disbursed from public funds. The difference being of course that the quantum of Dr Teo’s falsified works were readily calculable, while the absence of contemporaneous true quotations would have made it all but impossible to ascertain the extent that Mr Cheow had benefitted from the absence of true competition. Notwithstanding this, using the **_relative_** value of payments between what was disbursed to Dr Teo ($40,486) and Mr Cheow ($165 269.60), along with the fact that Dr Teo received a 46-week global imprisonment term, would make it rather clear that the defence’s recommendation that Mr Cheow serve a term of ten months’ and two weeks’ imprisonment to be indefensibly **_lenient_**. This is given that a mathematical calculation would show the scale of tainted transactions was more than **_four times_** higher in Mr Cheow’s case.

### Addressing the prosecution’s sentencing recommendation of 23 months’ imprisonment

98     On the distaff side, I was of the view that the prosecution’s recommendation of 23 months’ imprisonment was marginally on the high side. While the prosecution had taken the stance that their recommendation was “_proportional to the accused’s overall criminality, considering the many aggravating factors”__[\[note: 93\]](#Ftn_93)_ that had been highlighted, it was important to take a perspective view on sentencing by referencing cases of this genre. The most obvious precedent to index sentence would be _Tan Wen Jie_, given the “_ball park_” similarities between total amounts involved ($165 269 here and $131 089 in _Tan Wen Jie)_, as well as the amounts of the most serious charge ($43 700 here and $40,712 in _Tan Wen Jie_)_._

99     While the aspects of planning and premeditation were alike in both cases, it should be evident though that the nature and effect of _Tan Wen Jie’s_ offending was more severe. This is because the offender in _Tan Wen Jie_ had sought to defraud the State of the **_entire_** sum of $131 089 by ‘unlocking’ the residual value of the PARF rebates of vehicles, even as the cars remained in in the jurisdiction. The implications of Mr Tan’s offending were also more serious as these allowed ‘_phantom_’ vehicles to operate on local roads outside of the regime of registered ownership and mandated inspections, and where a number of traffic, motor insurance-related and even moneylender harassment offences were committed by users of these vehicles. As elaborated on earlier, Mr Cheow’s offending had taken the nature of creating a ‘_closed-loop_’ environment where he could, figuratively speaking, ‘_name his price_’ for MHA agency projects with impunity, in the absence of actual competitive quotations. The essential distinguishing factor from _Tan Wen Jie_ would be that the commissioned works here **_were_** performed and completed, with the court not being told of any complaints as to their quality.

### Preliminary impression of appropriate consecutive-running sentences

100    Given these premises, I was of the view that the recommended global sentence of 23 months’ imprisonment in the instant case, was too close to the 26 month-and two-week sentence imposed in _Tan Wen Jie_. Per _Gan Chai Bee_, it would be the sentencing court’s duty at this juncture of considering offence-specific facts to assess the appropriate sentence for **_each_** charge, and then holistically contemplate the **_overall_** sentence that ought be imposed.[\[note: 94\]](#Ftn_94) Accordingly, I was of the view, **_at this point_**, that the three consecutively-run sentences should have been as follows:

## Offender-specific considerations

### Limited value of late plea of guilt and purported ‘restitution/disgorgement of gains’

101    The next step was to look at **_offender-specific_** factors. Many of the salient points in this area have already been discussed in the foregoing, including the limited saliency[\[note: 95\]](#Ftn_95) of Mr Cheow’s purported restitution[^96] by making a sum of charitable contributions equivalent to the aggregate sum of the purchase orders in the 62 proceeded charges, as a mitigatory ground. I would also take the stand that Mr Cheow’s guilty plea, made after 41 days of trial had elapsed, would necessarily have extremely **_limited_** mitigatory value.

102    The decision to plead guilty had come after 27 witnesses had given their evidence. Given the completion of the evidence of these witnesses, out of a proposed slate of 33 witnesses, Mr Cheow’s plea had come in at an extremely advanced stages of the prosecution’s case. Mr Cheow would have been able to sample the testimonies and undertake an informed assessment on his prospects of success, or whether it was better to concede. He did the latter when the prosecution was close to closing its case. The point to be made was that Mr Cheow’s choice was a **_belated_** capitulation, and far removed and distinct from the scenario of a truly remorseful offender spontaneously making the critical decision to take that certain course early enough to substantially save the court’s and witnesses’ time, not to mention the expenditure[\[note: 97\]](#Ftn_97) of prosecutorial resources.

103    These foregoing are well established principles, recently restated _Wong Tian Jun De Beers v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 273</span>, where the Honourable Chief Justice explained that a guilty plea held value only where the course of action could be taken to reflect a genuine expression of remorse :

>  …(T)he fact that the Appellant pleaded guilty in this case should not have much, if any, weight accorded to it. While the Appellant pleaded guilty to the proceeded charges, I do not see that his plea of guilt is genuinely reflective of remorse. In _Chen Weixiong Jerriek v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 2 SLR(R) 334</span> at \[19\], the Court made clear that a plea of guilt _could_ be indicative of remorse, but that there was little mitigating value in pleading guilty where the proverbial “game was up”…

> \[Emphasis in the original\]

### The accused as an undetected multiple-offender, who should not be accorded ‘first-offender’ status, in cheating offences

104    I would also have agree with the point made by the prosecution that “_little weight should be placed on the fact that_ (Mr) Cheow _only has one unrelated antecedent”,__[\[note: 98\]](#Ftn_98)_ and in their citing the passage of _Koh Seah Wee_[^99]where Tay Yong Kwang J (as he then was) had held at in a case where the principal offender’s “_fraudulent acts in his previous workplaces came to light only fortuitously years after the events_”[^100]:

> …A clear distinction has to be drawn between those who break the law for the first time and those who have been flouting the law with impunity for years and are finally caught and charged for the first time. The latter class can hardly be called novices in crime. It would be much more apt to describe them as seasoned criminals skilled at avoiding detection…

105    The fact of an offender in Mr Cheow’s position having little basis to inveigle any mitigatory weight from his generally clean record is made even clearer in _Public Prosecutor v Leong Wai Nam_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGHC 283</span> where the High Court holds:

> … A clean record may be effective in showing that what an accused person did on one or two isolated occasions was totally out of character **_but carries hardly any mitigating force when an accused person is convicted of a string of offences committed over a spectrum of time. All it means is that the accused person was fortunate not to have been caught by the law earlier.._**.

> \[Emphasis added\]

### Ex-tempore grounds and summation

106    At the conclusion of the submissions on sentence by both the prosecution and defence, I had issued a set of _ex-tempore_ remarks on sentence,[\[note: 101\]](#Ftn_101) which had stressed the primacy of general deterrence, particularly where the acts of cheating amounted to a subversion of existing governmental procurement processes, and would inevitably trigger an undercurrent of public disquiet, if these were not decisively responded to by the meting of appropriately severe sentences.

107    These oral grounds would serve as a **_summation_** of my views on the bases of the sentences that ought be imposed on Mr Cheow in respect of the proceeded charges, and I would thus set them out below to supplement these as an encapsulation and summary of the preceding detailed grounds of decision (beginning from \[3\]):

> 3    In sentencing Mr Cheow, I do note that he is identified as the mastermind of the scheme. As director of _Buildforms Construction_, he had circumvented a requirement to source for and submit at least three genuine quotations made by three different, independent companies which were required for a category of works known as 'star rate' works.

> 4    The accused and Ms Kuan had instead instructed their staff at _Buildforms Construction_ to submit fictitious quotations for these star rate works. For these fictitious quotations, the staff were taught by the accused persons to ''randomly'' enter a price higher than the price quoted by _Buildforms Construction_**_._** This essentially ensured that _Buildforms Construction_ ' quoted price would be the lowest submitted to MHA department for the particular star rate work, with a practical concomitant guarantee that the company would land the project they had quoted for.

> 5     **_In my judgment, it is incumbent on the court to take a serious view of the manner of his offending, given that Mr Cheow's acts amounted to a clear subversion of existing governmental procurement processes_**. The prosecution has aptly characterized the offending as a frustration of the procurement process, and I would be inclined to agree, since the very rationale for requiring three quotations for these star rate works was to ensure transparency and open competition in the procurement processes, with an assurance that MHA (and by extension the taxpayer) would obtain star rate works at the best value for money. It would be expected that there would be disquiet by citizen taxpayers if this was not the case. I do note counsel's submissions that _Buildforms Construction_ that the contracted works were performed, and the works were not found to be wanting.

> 6    The principle however remains that by creating and submitting the fictitious quotations as described above, there would be no transparency. The principle behind the open sourcing of genuine quotations would always be to allow the MHA department concerned to be sure that the works were awarded to the bidder who could yield the best value for money. While counsel have emphasized that the bids placed at Mr Cheow's behest were fair and reasonable, the fact of the 'competing bids' being fictitious made this impossible for MHA to independently assess. I would agree with the prosecution's contention that "_if_ (Buildforms Construction) _genuinely sourced for independent quotations, there may have been lower priced quotations submitted that would offer MHA better value for money._ "

> 7    The deceptions had effectively locked MHA into a closed market of just one party; _Buildforms Construction_ who could specify their price at will since the fictitious bids would always be higher. While counsel has urged that the harm was minimal, **_this forced limitation, by its very nature of subverting a fair bidding process would have caused a degree of proprietary harm, which can never be ascertained because the genuine competing bids were never called_**.

> 8    Counsel had explained Mr Cheow's motive for the forged quotations to be predicated on a desire to avoid having to pay liquidated damages upon the projects being delayed. I do not, however, accept that the need to manage tight timelines would have been the accused's sole reason for offending, given the sheer duration and magnitude of his offending. Even if the avoidance of delay had been an initial motive, the fact that this was replicated 62 times would suggest that it had evolved to become a convenient modus operandi that he had habitually resorted to over the passage of time. Noting the prosecutions call for a deterrent sentence, I mindful here the persistence and scale of offending which involved, in all, a duration of three years where 62 instances of offending in relation to the charges proceeded at the trial.

> 9    Even considering the defence's submission of limited monetary harm, there is, in my view, a substantial degree of other forms of harm, including reputational harm. This case saw a high level of premeditation by Mr Cheow, to ensure that _Buildforms Construction_ would always tender the lowest bids, commission the creation of fake company stamps.

> 10      **_I am aware that a voluntary disgorgement was made but the mitigating value of the disgorgement must be limited by the fact that the rather late in the day_** **.** While the matter has seen 41 days of trial, Mr Cheow and Ms Kuan had finally pleaded guilty, and that fact is factored into sentencing, especially considering that several weeks of trial had been scheduled. I would also accept that Ms Kuan, who is less culpable, still played a substantial role, as she had instructed staff on how to perpetrate the forgeries.

> 11     I therefore find the prosecution's sentencing recommendations to be entirely appropriate. For Mr Cheow, I have noted the precedents, but made appropriate adjustments for proportionality, as well as the fact that Mr Cheow's initial motivation to offend was not necessarily upon a motive of greed or personal gain, which seemed the primary factor in the cases proffered.

### Adjustment made after considering offender-specific factors

108    As indicated at \[11\] of the extempore grounds, an adjustment was made to my original assessment that the global sentence of 20 months’ imprisonment. Looking at a combination of Mr Cheow’s charitable contributions, his belated plea of guilt and the fact that his **_initial_** motivation had been to avoid having to bear liquidated damages[\[note: 102\]](#Ftn_102), I was of the view that these, along with the desirability of rendering a truly proportionate sentence, would justify a further reduction of **_one month’s_** imprisonment from Mr Cheow’s global sentence.

### Why a one-month reduction of the overall sentence is fair and proportionate

109    While a one-month reduction might seem modest, I should emphasise that the forgoing would make it clear that Mr Cheow’s payment to the three charities as a purported disgorgement of benefits should gain little traction as a basis to reduce his sentence, given that to do otherwise in granting a substantial discount, would be to lend an impression that an offender could “_pay his way_” out of an imprisonment sentence, even if his offences involved 62 counts of systematic fraud visited on three MHA agencies, even where the High Court in _Dong Guitian_ had unequivocally reiterated that “_Offences involving public funds committed against public institutions have to be dealt with sternly as they amount to an assault on the common weal and undermine good administration_**_._**

110    Likewise, there should be no substantial reduction from Mr Cheow’s decision to plead guilty after 41 days of trial. This is more so considering that the accused’s plea of guilt came far later than in _Tan Wen Jie_, _Leong Weng Cheou_ and _Eric Zheng_, where not one of the trio of cases had seen even a _single_ day of trial, as the offenders there had, _ab initio_, registered their readiness to plead guilty.

111    Indeed the only aspect of the mitigation plea which might have given pause as effective mitigation would have been that Mr Cheow had first embarked on his scheme to produce falsified quotations because of his desire to avoid liquidated damages if he could not procure real quotations within the timelines stipulated by the MHA Term Contract. This contention might have been more persuasive however, if his term of offending had been short, and even more so if there had been any documentary evidence of feedback on Mr Cheow’s or _Buildforms Construction’s_ part to _Logistics Construction_ or facilities managers or MHA itself that the timelines were oppressively short, and that the regime for levying liquidated damages should be reconsidered.

112    The fact that no such representations existed, and that Mr Cheow had persisted to commit forgeries on quotations on 62 separate jobs over three years would undercut the validity of this mitigatory ground, and would render any appropriate discount on sentence to be marginal. All considered, however, I was convinced that it would be reasonable and proportionate, in the round, to allow a **_one-month_** reduction in sentence.

113    Accordingly, I reduced the term of DAC 922560-2017, involving the purchase order of $43 700 from 14 months’ imprisonment to **_13 months’_** imprisonment. As the other two proceeded charges which were to run consecutively, DAC-922427-2017 and DAC-922563-2017, would carry imprisonment terms of three months each, Mr Cheow’s adjusted final global sentence would be **_19 months’_** imprisonment.

### “Last look” considerations, whether final adjustments for proportionality and totality would be justified

114    Given the adjustments above, I was of the view that no further adjustments were required for the purposes of proportionality and totality. I was mindful of the injunction by the Honourable Chief Justice in _Public Prosecutor v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 148</span>, for sentencing courts to be watchful in assessing overall sentences that[^103] “_an aggregation resulting in a longer sentence is going to carry a compounding effect that bears more than a linear relation to the cumulative and overall criminality of the case_”.

115    I was convinced that there was little prospect of this possibility in the instant case, not was I of the belief that there was any additional factor that would have justified a further titration in the accused’s favour. This is particularly given that only three sentences had been ordered to run consecutively, rather than the six consecutive sentences in _Leong Weng Cheou_ and _Eric Zhang_, despite Mr Cheow facing ten proceeded charges, and had consented to a further 52 counts being taken into consideration. Further, I had eschewed the inclusion of the second most serious charge DAC-922442-2017, involving a purchase order of $8100, and where I had imposed a seven-month imprisonment term, from the run of consecutive sentences.

### Decision on Sentence

116    Accordingly the following sentences were imposed against the accused in respect of the ten proceeded charges :

117    The global sentence ultimately imposed was thus **_19 months’_** imprisonment. I do believe that the foregoing will show this to be a condign punishment, which addressed the stark need for effective deterrence for offences of this nature, but a global sentence that concomitantly would not be regarded as either crushing, or one that was unresponsive to, or inconsonant with Mr Cheow’s rehabilitative prospects.

### Present status of accused person

118    Upon his application, Mr Cheow was granted bail, and remains on bail pending the conclusion of his appeal.

### Appreciation

119    In concluding, I would like thank both defence counsel and the DPPs for their detailed and cogent submissions, which proved to be of significant assistance.
