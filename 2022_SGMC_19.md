### Deputy Registrar Lewis Tan:

## Introduction

1       The Plaintiff, Ms May Yip Mei Qi, was hired by the Defendant company, Studio XMSL Pte Ltd, for the better part of a year. After the Plaintiff tendered her resignation, the parties’ relationship began to sour as the Defendant formed the view that she had no intention to properly serve out her notice period. It was alleged that this was plain to see by her repeatedly taking medical leave from different clinics. Eventually, parties appeared before the Employment Claims Tribunal (“ECT”), where the Defendant claimed for salary in lieu of notice, and the Plaintiff counterclaimed, amongst others, for her unpaid salary for her final month of employment. While the Defendant’s claim was dismissed on its merits, the Plaintiff’s counterclaim was not considered as the Tribunal Magistrate (“TM”) considered that he lacked jurisdiction.

2       By way of the present action, the Plaintiff seeks to revive her counterclaim before the ECT, and she claims a sum total of about $6,000 from the Defendant. In response, the Defendant raises several counterclaims that were not before the TM, and which in the main seek to penalise the Plaintiff for her alleged errant conduct during her notice period.

## Background facts

3       The Defendant is an interior design company. In July 2019, the Plaintiff was hired as an Assistant Designer for the Defendant. Pursuant to her Letter of Employment, the Plaintiff was to be paid a gross monthly salary of $2,100 per month.

4       On 10 August 2020, the Plaintiff tendered her resignation, and parties agreed to an abridged notice period so that the Plaintiff’s last working day would be on 30 September 2020.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) During her notice period, the Plaintiff took medical leave for the entire week starting on 7 September 2020. Subsequently, the Plaintiff evinced that she would be on medical leave until her last working day on 30 September 2020. The Plaintiff then continued to be on medical leave from 14 to 16 September 2020. When she returned to the Defendant’s office on 17 September 2020, she was unwelcome, and attempts to resolve the dispute amicably were unsuccessful.[^2]

5       The Defendant then brought a claim against the Plaintiff before the ECT for $1,356.88, being salary in lieu of notice for 11 to 30 September 2020. The Plaintiff counterclaimed for her salary in September 2020, which remained unpaid, and other matters. The TM found that the Defendant was not entitled to salary in lieu of notice given that the Plaintiff was never absent without reasonable excuse as she was covered with medical leave until 16 September 2020. Even if the Plaintiff had intended to malinger, it was for the Defendant to impose the appropriate disciplinary consequences, such as to dismiss her without notice, or to treat her as having repudiated the employment contract and to then accept such repudiation.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) The Plaintiff’s counterclaim was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction as the counterclaim was lodged more than four weeks after the Defendant had filed its claim before the ECT, in contravention of s 12(6) of the Employment Claims Act 2016 (Act 21 of 2016) (“ECA”) read with reg 16 of the Employment Claims Regulations 2017 (S 136 of 2017).[^4]

6       The ECT’s decision failed to put the dispute to rest. Shortly after the TM’s decision, the Plaintiff initiated the present action against the Defendant, claiming broadly the same reliefs that she had sought but which were dismissed by the TM for lack of jurisdiction. Among others, the Plaintiff claimed for unpaid salary and CPF contributions for her final month of employment (in September 2020) as well as unpaid unconsumed leave and overtime. While the quantum of the Plaintiff’s claim was relatively small (at about $6,000), attempts by parties to resolve the matter amicably through mediation and settlement talks were unsuccessful, and after an amendment of the Defendant’s Defence and Counterclaim, the Plaintiff decided to proceed with the present striking out application.

7       By this application, the Plaintiff seeks to strike out four categories of averments in the Defendant’s Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 1) (“DCC1”), as follows:

> (a)     First, aspects of the defence which aver that the Plaintiff’s claim should be dismissed as such claim was already dismissed by the ECT for lack of jurisdiction (“the Jurisdiction Issue”);

> (b)     Second, aspects of the defence and counterclaim which seek to relitigate issues that were already decided by the TM (“the Re-litigation Issue”);

> (c)     Third, aspects of the counterclaim for interferences by the Plaintiff in the Defendant’s business (“the Interference of Business Issue”); and

> (d)     Fourth, aspects of the counterclaim for poor work performance by the Plaintiff (“the Poor Work Performance Issue”).

## The Jurisdiction Issue

8       A recurring theme in the Defendant’s defence is that the Plaintiff’s claim should be dismissed for the plain reason that such a claim was already dismissed by the ECT for lack of jurisdiction, and the Plaintiff then “intentionally chose not to file an appeal against the ECT’s order within the stipulated timeline”.[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5)

9       According to counsel for the Plaintiff, Ms Michelle Yap (“Ms Yap”), such averments disclose no reasonable defence to the Plaintiff’s claim as s 16(2) of the ECA provides as follows:

> (2)    Despite any other written law, _where a claim relating to a specified employment dispute is lodged with a tribunal, no proceedings relating to that claim can be commenced_ in any other court or an Industrial Arbitration Court by either party against the other, **_unless_** the claim is withdrawn, discontinued or _dismissed for lack of jurisdiction_. \[emphasis added in bold and italics\]

10     Against the express wording of s 16(2) above, Mr Matthew Lai (“Mr Lai”), the authorised representative of the Defendant, submitted that the wilful disregard of the ECT’s timelines give rise to a matter of law that should be determined at trial. In Mr Lai’s view, the ECA could not have been intended to allow those who neglect its timing and system to escalate the same claim to another court, thus wasting more resources of the State and of the parties involved.

11     I cannot agree with Mr Lai. Section 16(2) of the ECA clearly provides a safeguard against the multiplicity of proceedings by stipulating that parties that have had their disputes _substantively_ adjudicated before the ECT will not be able to raise the same claim “in any other court”. However, a clear exception to this are matters that are _not_ substantively adjudicated because the claim is “withdrawn, discontinued or dismissed for lack of jurisdiction” (s 16(2) of the ECA). It is only in these three restricted circumstances that a claim lodged with the ECT can be subsequently raised in another court.

12     In this case, the Plaintiff’s counterclaim was dismissed by the TM for lack of jurisdiction, and not for want of merit. As the TM observed at \[22\] of his judgment:[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6)

> As for \[the Plaintiff’s\] counterclaim, this tribunal lacks jurisdiction. To seise this tribunal of jurisdiction, the claim must be lodged within 4 weeks after the claim referral certificate (“CRC”) supporting the claim was issued (s 12(6) of the Employment Claims Act 2016 (Act 21 of 2016); reg 16 Employment Claims Regulations 2017 (S 136 of 2017)). However, this was not done: the CRC was issued on 1 December 2020 but \[the Plaintiff\] filed the counterclaim on 2 March 2021. \[The Plaintiff\] claimed that she had difficulty filing the claim online, but this cannot explain the profound delay and is \[in\] any event moot considering that, by her own account, the first time she tried filing the claim was on 26 January 2021.

13     It was then open to the Plaintiff to either appeal against the TM’s decision or to commence a fresh action. She elected to do the latter, as permitted by the express wording in s 16(2) of the ECA (“unless the claim is … dismissed for lack of jurisdiction”). Given this, aspects of DCC1 which seek to refute the Plaintiff’s claim on the ground that it had been dismissed by the ECT for lack of jurisdiction clearly disclose no reasonable defence to the Plaintiff’s claim, and they are accordingly struck out pursuant to O 18 r 19(1)(_a_) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Ed) (“ROC 2014”).

## The Re-litigation Issue

14     The Defendant also avers that the Plaintiff should not be entitled to her salary for the entire month of September 2020 as “she had fully utilised her contractually allocated annual medical leave entitlement” by 10 September 2020. As such, while she continued to be on medical leave until 16 September 2020, she was at best entitled to her salary until 10 September 2020 only.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7) Furthermore, as the Plaintiff was “absent from work since 4th Sept\[ember\] 2020 on recurring medical leave”, it is alleged that she did not fulfil the required handover process as required by her Letter of Employment. For this, the Defendant counterclaims for $900, “being the combined total … cost spent on the contracting of readily available freelance assistance to remedy the loss and inconveniences experienced by the Defendant due to the Plaintiff’s non-compliance with \[the\] Company\[’s\] handover procedures.”[^8]

15     According to Ms Yap, such averments amount to an attempt to re-litigate the issue of whether the Plaintiff was absent from work without valid reason during her final month of employment. This, it is submitted, was a matter which was considered by the TM, who found that the Plaintiff was “never absent without reasonable excuse”, and further that it was “unsafe … to conclude that \[the Plaintiff\] was malingering” when she took medical leave in September 2020.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9)

### Issue estoppel

16     Reference was first made to the Court of Appeal’s decision _in The Royal Bank of Scotland NV (formerly known as ABN Amro Bank NV) and others v TT International Ltd (nTan Corporate Advisory Pte Ltd and others, other parties) and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 1104</span> (“_TT International_”) at \[100\], where it was observed that “\[i\]ssue estoppel is that which arises ‘when a court of competent jurisdiction has determined some question of fact or law, either in the course of the same litigation (for example, as a preliminary point) or in other litigation which raises the same point between the same parties’: _per_ Lord Hoffmann in _Watt (formerly Carter) v Ahsan_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 AC 696</span>… at \[31\]”. In essence, Ms Yap submitted that since an issue estoppel applies, the Defendant’s averments in this regard are clearly unsustainable, and should be struck out.

17     A party seeking to invoke an issue estoppel must satisfy four requirements (_Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd v Management Corporation of Strata Title Plan No 301_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 3 SLR(R) 157</span> at \[14\]–\[15\]):

> (a)     First, there must be a final and conclusive judgment on the merits.

> (b)     Secondly, that judgment has to be by a court of competent jurisdiction.

> (c)     Thirdly, there has to be identity between the parties to the two actions that are being compared.

> (d)     Finally, there must be an identity of subject matter in the two proceedings.

18     In my judgment, it is clear that the first three requirements for an issue estoppel to operate have been satisfied. The ECT is a court of competent jurisdiction which has rejected the Defendant’s assertions that the Plaintiff was malingering. The ECT also concluded that she was properly covered by medical leave until 16 September 2020. No appeal was made against the ECT’s findings in this regard, and it is accordingly unimpeachable even if it might be wrong (_TT International_ at \[71\]). The ECT proceedings also concerned the same parties, albeit in opposite capacities. The only issue, therefore, is whether there is an identity of subject matter between the ECT and the present proceedings.

19     For there to be an identity of subject matter, “the issues must be identical in the sense that the prior decision must traverse the same ground as the subsequent proceeding and the facts and circumstances giving rise to the earlier decision must not have changed or should be incapable of change” (_Goh Nellie v Goh Lian Teck and others_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 1 SLR(R) 453</span> (“_Goh Nellie_”) at \[34\]).

20     However, as the Defendant submitted, the issues before the ECT and in the present proceedings are markedly different, even if they stem from the same facts. Before the ECT, the Defendant was claiming for salary in lieu of notice against the Plaintiff. The TM held that to succeed in such a claim, the Defendant “must show either that \[the Plaintiff\] effectively resigned without notice, or that \[the Plaintiff\] otherwise repudiated the contract and that \[the Defendant\] accepted such repudiation”.[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10) To this, the TM found that the Plaintiff could not have repudiated the contract as she was never absent without reasonable excuse since her absence until 16 September 2020 was covered by medical leave. Furthermore, while the Defendant had submitted that the Plaintiff was malingering when taking such medical leave, the TM rejected this assertion.[^11]

21     The arguments in the present proceedings differ. Here, the Plaintiff is claiming for her salary for the entire month of September 2020.[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12) In its defence, the Defendant avers as follows:

> 8    … the Plaintiff’s last actual working day in the office was on the 4th Sept 2020. She was on recurring medical leave thereafter and her last day of paid medical leave was on the 10th Sept 2020 as _she had fully utilised her contractually allocated annual medical leave entitlement._ Thereafter, her subsequent medical leave was deemed unpaid medical leave.

> 9.    On the 10th Sept 2020, the Plaintiff made a clear representation via email that she was going to be on medical leave until the end of her notice period – 30th Sept 2020. At that point in time, the Plaintiff did neither obtain nor present the necessary medical certifications supporting her medical leave until the end of her notice period.

> 10.    The Plaintiff continued to be on recurring unpaid medical leave till 16th Sept 2020 and _did neither have nor provide any further medical leave certifications from 17th Sept 2020 to the 30th Sept 2020_.

> …

> 12.    The Defendant denies the Plaintiff’s salary claim for the full month of Sept 2020 and is only agreeable to the salary claims of:

>> \- 4 days of work

>> \- 4 days of paid medical leave

>> Total: 8 days

> \[emphasis added\]

22     Flowing from this, the Defendant further counterclaims for $900, being the total cost spent on contracting freelance assistance to remedy the loss and inconveniences experienced by the Defendant due to the Plaintiff’s failure to “facilitate a smooth transition of her duties and responsibilities”. According to the Defendant, “\[e\]ven during her paid medical leave during her notice period, the Plaintiff was often unresponsive to phone calls from the \[Defendant\] with regards to work related matters.”[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13)

23     What emerges from the above is that while the Defendant undoubtedly made reference to the Plaintiff’s medical leave for the month of September 2020, this was done in response to the Plaintiff’s claim for salary for the entire month of September 2020. The issue of her medical leave was also raised to support a counterclaim for the Plaintiff’s alleged failure to comply with the Defendant’s handover procedures. Significantly, however, no allegation was made that the Plaintiff had repudiated the employment contract, or that she was malingering by taking medical leave in September 2020, these being the two key issues that the TM made his findings on (see \[20\] above). Instead, the defence is premised on the Plaintiff having fully utilised her medical leave entitlement by 10 September 2020, and further that she did not provide any medical leave certification from 17 to 30 September 2020. None of these latter issues seek to contradict the TM’s findings, nor were such issues substantively considered by the TM. Accordingly, there is no risk of conflicting findings by the ECT and the trial court on the same issues.

24     Furthermore, another “idea that is encompassed within the requirement of an identity of issues is that the issue in question should be shown in fact to have been raised and argued” (_Goh Nellie_ at \[38\]). This is where the Plaintiff faces a further impasse. As mentioned, the issues that the Defendant now raises are issues which were not considered by the TM as they were neither raised nor argued during the ECT proceedings. Given the lack of actual investigation into such issues, the policy that litigants should not be twice vexed by the same matter is simply not engaged, and the doctrine of issue estoppel does not apply.

### Abuse of process

25     The Plaintiff further asserts that the Defendant’s attempt to re-litigate the point about her medical leave during the period of September 2020 amounts to an abuse of process. The doctrine of “_res judicata_ and abuse of process are ‘overlapping’ concepts ‘with the common underlying purpose of limiting abuse and duplicative litigation’”: _TT International_ at \[102\], citing _Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd v Zodiac Seats UK Ltd (formerly Contour Aerospace Ltd)_ \[2014\] AC 160 at \[25\], per Lord Sumption.

26     This “extended” doctrine of _res judicata_ or the defence of abuse of process “prevents a party from re-arguing points even when they have not been raised in earlier proceedings, provided that such points are those which belonged to the subject of former litigation and which the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, ought properly to have raised and argued then”: _Goldbell Engineering Pte Ltd v Etiqa Insurance Pte Ltd (Range Construction Pte Ltd, third party) and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGHC 1</span> at \[90(c)\], citing _TT International_ at \[101\]–\[102\]. This is a deeply fact-centric exercise that requires the court to inquire into all the circumstances of the case (_Goh Nellie_ at \[53\]). At end (_Lim Geok Lin Andy v Yap Jin Meng Bryan and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 760</span> at \[44\]),

> … the court will exercise its discretion in such a way as to strike a balance between allowing a litigant with a genuine claim to have his day in court on the one hand and ensuring that the litigation process would not be unduly oppressive to the defendant on the other. …

27     This fact-centric inquiry is amply demonstrated by the House of Lords’ decision of _Johnson v Gore Wood & Co (a firm)_ \[2002\] 2 AC 1. In that case, the plaintiff’s company’s action for negligence against the defendants was settled with costs. Some four and a half years later, the plaintiff brought another action against the defendants to recover his personal losses arising out of the same matters. This plaintiff’s action was summarily dismissed by the English Court of Appeal as amounting to an abuse of process. In reversing this decision, the House of Lords noted that the earlier settlement with the defendants had been proceeded on the basis of an underlying assumption that a further proceeding by the plaintiff to recover his personal losses would not be an abuse. Therefore, it would be unfair for the defendants to go back on that assumption.

28     In the present case, the averments which the Plaintiff seeks to strike out pertain to whether she was entitled to paid medical leave after 10 September 2020, and further whether she was covered by medical leave from 17 to 30 September 2020 (see \[23\] above). These would have been points that the Defendant could reasonably have been expected to raise, and which the TM could have considered, had the Plaintiff been allowed to proceed with her counterclaim before the ECT; the subject matter of her counterclaim in the ECT proceedings were, as mentioned, broadly similar to her claim in the present proceedings. However, the counterclaim was not considered as the TM held that he lacked jurisdiction since the counterclaim was lodged more than four weeks after the Defendant’s claim in the ECT. This finding on the lack of jurisdiction was not appealed by the Plaintiff.

29     Thus, the delay was solely attributable to the Plaintiff, with the attendant result that any defences that the Defendant could have been expected to raise in response to the Plaintiff’s counterclaim were not considered by the TM. Any failure to raise the averments which the Plaintiff now seeks to impugn was therefore primarily attributable to the Plaintiff’s, _and not the Defendant’s_, lack of reasonable diligence. In the circumstances, it is clearly improper for the Plaintiff to seek the striking out of the Defendant’s averments which were _not_ even considered by the TM due to her own delay in raising her counterclaim. As such, the doctrine of abuse of process does not apply as well, and this aspect of DCC1 shall remain.

## The Interference of Business Issue

30     In addition, the Defendant counterclaims for the interference of business that was allegedly caused by the Plaintiff and her boyfriend’s associates. According to DCC1, after 16 September 2020, and on the Plaintiff’s request, the Plaintiff’s boyfriend and his associates left numerous defamatory posts on various online social media platforms that were designed to negatively affect the Defendant’s reputation. In response, the Defendant engaged solicitors, who prepared and sent several letters of demand to the boyfriend’s associates. Three days after these letters of demand were sent, the online posts were all taken down, and this in the Defendant’s view “remedied the interferences of business suffered by the Defendant”. For this episode, the Defendant avers that the Plaintiff failed to “use her best endeavour to promote the interests, business and welfare of the \[Defendant\]”, in breach of clause 4.1 of her Letter of Employment. This caused the Defendant to suffer losses of $1,070, being “the amount the Defendant paid out to the Lawyer for the Letters of Demand that remedied the business interferences”.[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14)

31     According to Ms Yap, this discloses no reasonable cause of action as the claim in defamation has not been established and hence it cannot be said that the Defendant is entitled to the costs of sending the letters of demand. As the Law Society of Singapore Practice Direction 1.8.1(B) provides: “Where a legal practitioner is instructed to collect a simple debt, it is improper for the legal practitioner to also demand the costs of the letter which he/she sends to the debtor because at that stage it cannot be said that the costs of the letter are properly recoverable in law” (“the Law Society’s Practice Direction”). Furthermore, the letters of demand were addressed to the Plaintiff’s boyfriend’s associates, who are not parties to the present matter.

32     In my view, these submissions mischaracterise the Defendant’s counterclaim. The Defendant’s counterclaim in this respect is premised on a breach of clause 4.1 of the Plaintiff’s Letter of Employment, and not for defamation against her boyfriend’s associates. The reference to the cost of the letters of demand (of $1,070) simply serves as a proxy for the amount of damages suffered by the Plaintiff’s alleged breach of clause 4.1. This does not thereby transform the breach of contract claim against the Plaintiff to a claim in defamation against the associates. It may well be that the rule against double recovery would bar the Defendant from mounting _both_ a counterclaim against the Plaintiff and a separate claim against the associates for the same legal costs, but this is not the argument that the Plaintiff is making, nor is there any evidence that the Defendant has commenced separate proceedings to recover the $1,070 from the associates.

33     Furthermore, the Law Society’s Practice Direction is inapplicable as the Defendant is not a legal practitioner, nor is it claiming for a simple debt from the associates. Also, it bears repeating that the present counterclaim emanates from the breach of a clause in the Plaintiff’s employment contract, and _not_ for the alleged (and unproven) defamation by the associates.

34     Thus, the cause of action is clear, being one based on a breach of clause 4.1 of the Letter of Employment, and the merits of the Defendant’s counterclaim in this regard ought to be tested at trial, rather than struck out at this juncture.

## The Poor Work Performance Issue

35     Finally, the Plaintiff submits that the Defendant’s counterclaim for $525 for alleged poor work performance for the months of August and September 2020[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15) should be struck out for being “devoid of any particulars of what this alleged poor work performance is”. According to Ms Yap, the lack of particulars renders this cause of action frivolous and vexatious as the Plaintiff would have no manner of knowing how the $525 was arrived at. Alternatively, given the lack of particulars, no reasonable cause of action is disclosed, and the Plaintiff would be prejudiced if she were required to plead to such a claim.

36     However, Ms Yap was unable to point to any authority whereby pleadings have been struck out for lacking particulars. In this regard, it has been noted that even a serious want of particularity in a pleading may not justify a striking out if the defect can be remedied and the defect is not the result of a blatant disregard of court orders (_Total English Learning Global Pte Ltd and anor v Kids Counsel Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGHCR 22</span> (“_Total English Learning_”) at \[43\]; _Singapore Civil Procedure_ vol I (Cavinder Bull gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 2021) (“_Singapore Civil Procedure_”) at para 18/19/10).

37     Indeed, in _Gabriel Peter & Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin and others_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 3 SLR(R) 649</span>, the Court of Appeal observed at \[21\] that “\[w\]here a statement of claim is defective only in not containing particulars to which the defendant is entitled, the application should be made for particulars under O 18 r 12 and not for an order to strike out the statement”. O 18 r 19 of ROC 2014 also empowers the Court to order the amendment of pleadings in lieu of a striking out order: see _Singapore Civil Procedure_ at para 18/19/2.

38     To my mind, notwithstanding the lack of particulars for this cause of action, an order for amendment would be a far more proportionate response than a striking out order. Such an order would reduce the need for any application for further particulars or to amend the pleadings, and would be more proportionate to the relatively small sums claimed in both the claim and counterclaim (see O 108 r 1(3) of ROC 2014 and _Total English Learning_ at \[43\]–\[44\]).

39     Ms Yap appeared to be agreeable to this less draconian course of action, and she stated that she would have no objections if the relevant averments were struck out without prejudice to the Defendant filing amended pleadings with the necessary particulars. While somewhat circuitous, this appears to lend to the same result, namely the amendment of DCC1 so that more particulars may be added in respect of this cause of action. Mr Lai also represented that the Defendant would be able to provide more information and details of the Plaintiff’s alleged poor work performance if allowed to do so. Hence, the Defendant is granted leave to amend DCC1 to include further particulars of the Plaintiff’s poor work performance.

## Conclusion

40     In summary, my orders are as follows:

> (a)     Paragraphs 6, 16, 23 and 31 of DCC1 which stipulate that various aspects of the Plaintiff’s claim were dismissed at the ECT are struck out for disclosing no reasonable defence. All other respects of DCC1 are not struck out and shall be retained;

> (b)     The Defendant is granted leave to amend DCC1, supplementing paragraphs 49 to 51 of DCC1 to include further particulars of the Plaintiff’s alleged poor work performance by 28 April 2022; and

> (c)     The Plaintiff shall file her Reply and Defence to Counterclaim by 12 May 2022.

41     I will hear parties on costs of this application on a later date, and directions will then be given to move the matter towards trial on an expedited basis.

## Post-script on the simplified process

42     During the course of these proceedings, Mr Lai submitted that the steps taken were disproportionate to the sums claimed, and antithetical to spirit of the simplified process in O 108 of ROC 2014, to which the present case applies. I harboured the same concerns, and so this striking out application was held in abeyance while parties attempted to resolve the matter amicably, be it through without prejudice discussions, the exchange of settlement offers, or mediation.

43     Unfortunately, these alternative forms of dispute resolution have yielded no result. This is notwithstanding the relatively small sums in dispute, and even though parties have previously had part of their dispute resolved by the ECT. Given this, it appears that the next best step is to move the matter towards trial as soon as possible, so that it can finally be resolved on its merits and put to rest, in the interest of all parties involved.

44     With that said, even as parties approach the doorstep of trial, it is not too late for them to continue to explore conciliatory steps. Nonetheless, failing an amicable resolution, the Court must allow the matter to take its course and to facilitate the fair, expedient and inexpensive _determination_ of the matter. This entails the consideration of interlocutory applications, and where such applications prove to be unmeritorious, adverse costs orders and appropriate directions may be given to dissuade parties from taking further dilatory tactics. Ultimately, the task of achieving justice requires the Court to carefully weigh and consider all the interests in each case, and to tailor responses best suited to the fair disposal of each matter.
