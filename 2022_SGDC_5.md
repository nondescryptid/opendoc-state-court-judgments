\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9288/2021/01.\]

5 January 2022

### District Judge Lim Wen Juin:

1       The accused, a 30-year-old man, pleaded guilty to two charges under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the MDA”). One charge was for possession of a controlled drug under s 8(_a_) of the MDA (the “drug possession charge”), and the other was for possession of utensils intended to be used for the consumption of a controlled drug under s 9 of the MDA (the “utensils charge”). After convicting the accused on both charges I imposed a sentence of eight months’ imprisonment in respect of the drug possession charge and two months’ imprisonment in respect of the utensils charge. I ordered that these sentences run consecutively so that the global sentence was ten months’ imprisonment. The accused has lodged an appeal against sentence and so I set out now in writing my reasons for imposing these sentences.

2       On 31 March 2020, around 6.15pm, the accused was arrested near his home by officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau. The officers escorted the accused to his home and searched his bedroom in his presence and seized various items. Among the items seized were packets cumulatively containing at least 26.71g of vegetable matter that upon analysis was found to contain MDMB-4en-PINACA, which is a Class A controlled drug, as well as a digital weighing scale with a damp powdery substance on it that upon analysis was also found to contain the same drug. The accused’s possession of these items gave rise to the drug possession charge. The items seized also included numerous rolling papers that were meant for use in smoking MDMB-4en-PINACA. The accused’s possession of these rolling papers gave rise to the utensils charge.

3       The prosecution proposed a sentence of eight to 12 months’ imprisonment for the drug possession charge and four months’ imprisonment for the utensils charge. The prosecution submitted that these sentences of imprisonment should run consecutively so as to yield a global sentence of 12 to 16 months’ imprisonment.

4       The accused made the following points in mitigation:

> (a)     He had recently become a father and his baby was barely three months old.

> (b)     He and his wife had purchased a new home and they had mortgage instalments to pay.

> (c)     The criminal proceedings have affected his job.

> (d)     He is enrolled in a SGUnited programme with the Singapore Institute of Management (“SIM”) that is due to conclude in June 2022.

> (e)     He had been saving money for a wedding dowry.

> (f)     He had medical conditions, in that he would require surgery to reconstruct his anterior cruciate ligament and needed to undergo a neurology check because he experienced instability when standing.

5       The accused asked for “curfew or probation” to be imposed. He also submitted that, in the event imprisonment was imposed, the sentences for the charges should run concurrently and not consecutively. He requested that he commence any term of imprisonment after the conclusion of his course at SIM in June 2022.

6       I did not deal with his request for “curfew” because I did not understand that to be a sentencing option available to me. As for his submission that probation be ordered, I thought that this was a non-starter such that there was no need even to call for a probation report. This was because the accused was well over 21 years old both at the time he committed the offences and at the time of conviction, and his drug-related offences are regarded by the legislature and the courts as serious in nature and requiring general and specific deterrence, and the points advanced by the accused in mitigation did not reveal exceptional circumstances that would furnish a reason why rehabilitation should displace deterrence as the dominant sentencing consideration.

7       For the drug possession charge, the maximum sentence is ten years’ imprisonment and a fine of $20,000. Although the MDA does not prescribe any mandatory minimum sentence, I considered myself bound by High Court authority to adopt a sentencing range of six to 18 months’ imprisonment given that the accused was a first-time offender and the drug possession charge concerned a Class A drug: see _Liew Zheng Yang v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 1160</span> at \[17\]–\[18\]. Within that range, I thought that High Court authority has also established that the sentence of six months’ imprisonment at the lowest end of the range would generally be applicable only in cases involving particularly young offenders, and that where an offender was not particularly young and was a “casual” rather than “one-off” user of drugs the usual sentence would be about eight months’ imprisonment: see _Public Prosecutor v Lim Cheng Ji Alvin_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 183</span> at \[28\]–\[29\].

8       In this case, given that the accused also had in his possession numerous rolling papers intended for use in consuming drugs, I drew the inference that the accused was not a one-off user of drugs and was instead a casual user. I did not see anything in the statement of facts or the accused’s mitigation that suggested that the quantity of drugs possessed by the accused or his overall culpability was unusually high or low. Therefore I thought it appropriate to impose the usual sentence of eight months’ imprisonment for the drug possession charge.

9       As for the utensils charge, the prosecution submitted that the usual sentence was four months’ imprisonment. The prosecution did not cite any precedents in support of its submission but I saw no reason to doubt it given that the maximum sentence for this offence is three years’ imprisonment and a fine of $10,000 and the term of imprisonment sought by the prosecution was not a large fraction – one-ninth – of the maximum. In view of the unremarkable nature of the accused’s culpability and my inference that he could not be characterised as a merely one-off user I was prepared to use four months’ imprisonment as the starting point for the utensils charge.

10     As to whether the sentences of imprisonment for the charges should run consecutively or concurrently, I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that the starting point was that they should run consecutively. The accused’s acts of possessing vegetable matter containing MDMB-4en-PINACA and possessing numerous rolling papers were separate and distinct, and the mere fact that both acts were discovered at the same time when his bedroom was searched did not mean that they formed one transaction. The drug possession charge and utensils charge implicate different legally protected interests: the offence of possessing drugs protects society’s interest in ensuring that illicit substances are not available to begin with, whereas the offence of possessing drug-related utensils protects society’s interest in ensuring that such substances, even if available, are not used or consumed by people.

11     If the sentences of eight months’ imprisonment for the drug possession charge and four months’ imprisonment for the utensils charge were to run consecutively the global sentence would be 12 months’ imprisonment. The prosecution submitted that this was appropriate. The prosecution pointed out that the accused’s possession of drugs as well as utensils intended for use in consuming drugs gave rise to a very strong supposition that the accused had consumed drugs – or, I would add, had at least formed a concrete intention to do so and had taken substantial steps towards the carrying out of that intention such as to constitute a punishable attempt – and if the accused had been convicted on a drug consumption charge under s 8(_b_) of the MDA there would be a mandatory minimum sentence of one year’s imprisonment, and 12 months’ imprisonment could not be excessive because it was no more than the mandatory minimum sentence that the accused could very plausibly have been facing. While this struck me as a broadly sensible submission, given that the accused had not been charged for drug consumption I thought that this should not preclude me from imposing a global sentence of less than 12 months’ imprisonment if that would otherwise be warranted.

12     I thought that there were factors present in this case that justified a less severe approach towards the accused. Leaving aside the fact that he had a clean record and was pleading guilty at an early enough stage to suggest that he felt genuine remorse, I considered it pertinent that he (a) was fairly young, (b) had moved into a new home with his wife and recently become a father, and (c) was enrolled in a programme at SIM. These factors seemed to me to constitute circumstances in his life that would motivate him significantly to turn over a new leaf and keep away from criminal behaviour, and this gave me reason to be optimistic about his rehabilitative prospects.

13     Given this optimism I thought that it would be appropriate to reduce the global sentence below what the prosecution was proposing. Maintaining the sentence of eight months’ imprisonment for the drug possession charge, I achieved this by imposing a sentence of two months’ imprisonment for the utensils charge. I ordered that the sentences run consecutively so that the global sentence was ten months’ imprisonment. As for the accused’s request that he start serving his sentence after June 2022, I was not prepared to grant such a long deferment and stipulated 5 January 2022 as the commencement date.
