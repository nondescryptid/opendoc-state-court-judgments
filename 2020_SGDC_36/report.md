Industrial Accident – Negligence – Whether injury was a pre-existing injury or the result of the accident – causation

26 February 2020

### District Judge Lee Li Choon:

## Introduction

1       The Plaintiff (P) was a Bangladeshi national employed as a welder and flame cutter by the 1st Defendant (D1). At the material time, P was assigned to work on board a ship berthed at a shipyard located at 19 Pandan Road (“the premises”) and the 2nd Defendant (D2) was at the material time, the occupier of the premises.

2       On 24 June 2016, while in the course of employment, P was required to carry welding cables weighing about 30kg from the main deck of the ship to the inspection area that was located at the basement level of the ship. After descending from the gangway, while walking towards the inspection area, P’s safety boots got caught underneath a scaffolding pipe that was on the floor and P fell and sustained injuries (‘the accident”). P’s injuries include a T12 compression fracture of his spine. In this suit, P is claiming for damages for the injuries suffered while being in the course of his employment with D1 and working at D2’s premises.

## P’s pleaded case

3       P says he was required to walk across an area that had debris, materials such as scaffolding pipes and equipment strewn all over on the floor while carrying a heavy weight. In gist, P’s pleaded case against D1 is that D1 has failed to provide a safe place for him to work or failed to take reasonably practicable steps to eliminate foreseeable risk to persons working at the premises, such as for example, ensuring a safe and debris-free pathway to bring the cables to the inspection area.

4       In gist, P’s case against D2 is that D2 has failed to take reasonably practicable measures to ensure that any machinery, equipment, article or substance kept on the premises are safe and without risks to every person within those premises.

## D’s pleaded case

5       Both D1 and D2 pleaded a joint Defence. The Defendants’ pleaded case is as follows:

> (a)     P ought to have taken a proper pathway that was put in place for workers like him to cross to bring the cables to the inspection area; and instead of taking that proper pathway, he took a shortcut by cutting across the scaffolding area to the inspection area[^1].

> (b)     P fell forwards instead of backwards and thus, the T12 compression fracture was not caused by the said fall[^2].

> (c)     After the fall, P got up on his own and continued to work from 24 June 2016 until 13 July 2016 (i.e., for 3 weeks after the alleged fall) before seeking medical treatment[^3]. This shows he was well after the alleged fall and the T12 compression fracture could not have arisen from the said fall and was instead, a pre-existing injury.

## Issues arising from parties’ pleaded case

6       Arising from the pleaded case of the parties, the following are the issues to be decided on and findings of fact that I have to make:

> (a)     What was the condition of the location where P fell? This issue examines the condition of the premises to assess whether P fell because of the Defendants’ negligence in failing to provide a safe workplace to work in or in failing to keep the premises relatively hazard-free.

> (b)     Was there a proper pathway put in place for P to use as alleged by the Defendants? This issue concerns whether P has wholly or to a substantial degree, caused his own injury by virtue of his own negligence in taking a shortcut instead of the proper pathway put in place for him to use.

> (c)     Was P’s injury caused by the fall on that day? The Defendants disputed that the T12 compression injury was caused by the fall on 24 June 2016 and alleged that it was an “old fracture”, in other words, a pre-existing injury. This issue concerns causation – whether the injury (T12 compression fracture) was caused by the accident.

## My Decision

### What was the condition of the place of accident where P fell?

7       In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, P averred as follows:

> “6.    On 24 June 2016 (“the material day”), in the course of my work, my co-worker, Masud and I were required to send some welding cable (“the cable”) for inspection. In order to carry out the task, Masud and I had to carry the cable from the main deck to the inspection area at the basement level of the Ship. At the material time, I carried a 30kg cable on my right shoulder and sent it for inspection.

> 7.    In order to go down to the inspection area, we had to descend a gangway ladder that led to the basement level. At the material time, the access path leading to the inspection area at the basement level was strewn with debris, various materials and equipment. Workers working at the basement level generally had to be mindful of their steps when they walked from one area to another.”[^4]

8       From the photographs[^5] exhibited by P in his affidavit, I can see many scaffolding pipes, ladders, containers strewn in a disorganised fashion all over the floor. Based on what I can see from the photographs, many of the scaffolding pipes or metal pipes were not lying flat on the floor but were a little raised from the surface of the floor as they were strewn on top of one and another. According to P, his co-worker, Masud took these photographs about two or three days after the accident (i.e., about 2 or 3 days after 24 June 2016) and the ship was still in the same position and same condition as it was on the day of the accident[^6]. Although P was cross-examined quite extensively about the photographs, there was nothing that contradicted what can be seen from the photographs. The photographic evidence therefore went unchallenged.

9       From the photographs, I find that it is reasonably foreseeable for a worker who had to work his way through such a place and carrying cables weighing about 30 kg to have his shoes caught by the scaffolding pipes and other materials strewn all over the floor and to fall as a result of that.

10     At the trial, P answered all questions and his testimony remained consistent. He explained that it was a combination of the heavy weight of the cables that he was carrying and the fact that he had to navigate through a floor that was strewn with scaffolding pipes and all kinds of materials all over the floor that caused his safety shoe to be stuck in between some pipes that caused him to trip and fall[^7].

11     When cross-examining P, counsel for the Defendants tried to suggest that the area could have been barricaded to prevent workers’ entry. However, this was not pleaded. It is not the pleaded case of the Defendants that P should not have walked through a barricaded area[^8]. There is also no evidence whatsoever to show that the place of the accident was a barricaded area.

12     The Defendants’ evidence as regards the accident is adduced through their only factual witness - Mr Mohamad Fazli Bin Ismail (“Mr Fazli”) who is the Defendants’ administrative manager in charge of safety. It is not disputed by Mr Fazli that on 24 June 2016, P was on board the ship preparing for a monthly welding cable inspection[^9]. According to Mr Fazli, P was working together with his co-worker, Aknda Masud (this is the same Masud mentioned by P as the co-worker who was with him at the time of the accident). Mr Fazli said in his AEIC that what he found from Aknda Masud in the course of enquiring from him is that, “_it appears that in the course of work (P) and (Aknda Masud) were carrying welding cables on their shoulder and proceeding to another location_” and that, “_(Aknda Masud) had been walking behind (P) when he witnessed (P) fall forward and land on the ground_.”[^10]

13     I note that even though Mr Fazli had questioned Aknda Masud who witnessed P’s fall, he did not record Aknda Masud’s statement and did nothing to investigate into the accident[^11]. When Mr Fazli was referred to paragraph 4 of his affidavit of evidence in chief[^12] where he deposed to the fact that Defendants would make reasonable efforts to contact Aknda Masud and bring him back to Singapore and asked what reasonable efforts had been made by the Defendants to locate Aknda Masud, he readily agreed that no efforts were made to locate Aknda Masud. Further, Mr Fazli could not give any reason or excuse as to why Aknda Masud who had witnessed the fall has not been called to give evidence.[^13] It is clear that neither D1 nor D2 did anything to investigate into or find out more about the accident. Under these circumstances, I find that it is appropriate to draw an adverse inference against the Defendants.

14     Other than Defendants’ bare allegation that _“(t)he trip and fall occurred at about 2.30pm at which time the lighting at the shipyard was good. There was no reason for (P) to miss the scaffolding pipe had he kept a proper lookout_”[^14], the Defendants have adduced no evidence whatsoever to show what the floor condition was like and what the lighting condition at or around the time of accident at where P fell was like. As the premises belong to D2, it would have been easy for D2 to take photographs around the place where P fell to show the state of the premises; yet, the Defendants did not do so shortly after the accident.

15     Instead, at the trial, the Defendants sought to adduce undated photographic evidence of an unknown location within a ship. These photographs were allegedly taken by a representative of D2 and provided to D1. When questioned, Mr Fazli could not confirm if the said photographs were taken at the worksite where the accident happened and around the time of the accident[^15]. Other than the fact that the photographs were provided to D1 by D2, the maker of the photographs is also unknown. As a result, I had no choice but to strike out all of the “fresh” evidence in the form of the photographs that the Defendants sought to tender at the trial.

16     Therefore, with respect to the condition of the place of accident, there is only the affidavit evidence of P and P’s photographic evidence which show that there were scaffolding pipes and other materials strewn all over the floor. The available evidence shows the place where P fell to be badly maintained. The condition of the floor is such that it is reasonably foreseeable for a worker carrying 30 kg of cables on him and moving across such a floor to get to the cable inspection area to have his shoes caught in one of the scaffolding pipes and to trip and fall as a result. The Defendants have therefore failed to provide a safe place or a hazard free environment for P to work in.

### Was there a proper pathway put in place for P to use?

17     The Defendants allege in their Defence that - “_The path of travel was through a proper gangway that was in place. Instead of using the gangway, the Plaintiff took a shortcut by crossing across the scaffolding to reach the inspection area.”[^16]_

18     I will first look at the Defendants’ evidence in relation to this allegation.

19     In Mr Fazli’s affidavit of evidence in chief, he averred, “_In order to reach the inspection area, the Plaintiff’s proper path of travel was through a proper gangway that was in place. Clear instructions were given to all the workers to use the proper gangway as it was the safe pathway. The Plaintiff took a shortcut across the scaffolding area to reach the inspection area. While so doing, the Plaintiff tripped over a horizontal scaffolding pipe.”[^17]_

20     Other than a bare allegation that there was a “proper gangway” or “proper pathway”, the Defendants have adduced no affidavit evidence whatsoever to show what this “proper gangway” or “proper pathway” was or what it looked like. Further, neither of the two Defendants called any witness to give evidence on their behalf as regards this “proper gangway” or “proper pathway”.

21     At the trial, the Defendants sought to introduce various photographs allegedly taken by a representative of D2 that were provided to D1[^18] to show what the accident site looked like and what the Defendants meant by “proper gangway”. As I have already stated, these photographs were not adduced through their only factual witness, Mr Fazli. As this witness could not attest to having taken the photographs, when the photographs were taken and whether the photographs show the accident site at the ship in question[^19], I did not allow the photographs to be admitted as the Defendants’ evidence. Instead, these photographs were allowed to be used merely as exhibits for cross-examination purposes only. In this connection, at cross-examination, it transpired that the photographs were taken at least a month or more after the accident[^20]. Thus, they are of little or no value to support the Defendants’ allegation that there was a proper gangway or pathway. Given the time lag, these photographs are also of little value in showing the condition of the accident site at the material time.

22     In cross-examination, Mr Fazli also agreed that D2 as the occupier of the premises has a duty to ensure that the premises is kept safe for everyone, including workers like P to use[^21]. Mr Fazli further agreed that D2 was aware of the accident as D2 did take photographs, albeit the photographs were taken a month or more later (sometime end July or early August 2016)[^22].

23     In cross-examination, Mr Fazli said that the reason why D2 was only made aware of the accident about a month later was because D1 had failed to inform D2 about the accident. Mr Fazli conceded that it was the duty of D1 (after having been informed by P’s supervisor about the accident) to surface the accident to D2 so that an investigation into the accident could be conducted but this was not done[^23].

24     It is also telling that while it is admitted that D2 was subsequently made aware of the accident, D2 did not call any witness to testify as to when they knew about the accident or who informed them about it. In any event, it is clear that neither D1 nor D2 conducted any investigation into the accident or if they did, neither adduced any evidence to show what their investigations revealed about the accident.

25     In the circumstances, I am left with only P’s testimony and the evidence he has adduced as regards the accident and how it happened.

26     In cross-examination, P said he walked across the area that was shown by his photographs to have scaffolding pipes and other materials strewn all over because it was the usual pathway for workers to walk though. P said, “_even the safety personnel and the yard people also used the same way_”.[^24] At the time of the fall, P was in fact walking to the inspection area together with his co-worker, Aknda Masud[^25] who witnessed his fall. The Defendants do not dispute this fact[^26]. I therefore note that P was not alone in taking that pathway. Indeed, a co-worker working with P also took that same pathway. Based on this, there is therefore even more reason to believe that this was the pathway to the inspection area and it is more likely than not that there was no pathway or gangway provided by the Defendants for P to use as alleged by the Defendants.

27     P sought to rely on a Statutory Declaration of Aknda Masud done in Bengali. This Statutory Declaration was exhibited in P’s affidavit of evidence in chief. As Aknda Masud was not called as a witness, the content of his Statutory Declaration cannot be relied upon as evidence. Be that as it may, I note that on the face of the Statutory Declaration[^27], the description of the floor condition given by Aknda Masud who witnessed P’s fall on 24 June 2016) corroborates P’s photographic evidence.

28     Section 105 of the Evidence Act states, “The burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on that person who wishes the court to believe in its existence, unless it is provided by any law that the proof of that fact shall lie on any particular person.”

29     As it is the Defendants’ case that they had provided a proper pathway for P to take the cables to the inspection area and that P ought not to have walked across the area that had scaffolding pipes strewn all over the floor where the accident happened, the burden of proof of this fact lies on the Defendants. As the Defendants have adduced no evidence whatsoever to prove this fact, I therefore find that there was no proper gangway or pathway constructed for P to use. The Defendants’ case that P ought not to have walked across the area with scaffolding pipes and materials strewn all over is clearly not made out.

30     In the circumstances, I conclude that the Defendants have failed to provide a safe work place or a relatively hazard free premises for P to carry out his assigned tasks. As such, the Defendants are liable for the injury suffered by the Plaintiff as a result of the fall. As there is no basis to hold that the Plaintiff was contributorily negligent at all, the Defendants are therefore wholly liable for the Plaintiff’s injury caused by the fall in so far as the injury is caused by the fall.

### Was P’s injury (in particular, the T12 compression fracture) caused by the fall on that day?

31     As regards the issue of causation of P’s injury, the Defendants’ pleaded position is that, “_After the fall, the Plaintiff got up on his own and there were no visible injuries sustained. The Plaintiff continued to work from the date he fell i.e. 24.6.2016 until 13.7.2016 (3 weeks) which was when he went to hospital for treatment and given 2 days medical leave.”[^28]_ Based on this, the Defendants say that the T12 compression fracture that was discovered some 3 weeks later was not an injury that arose from the accident.

32     The Defendants’ contention is therefore this – that P seemingly did not suffer any injury from the fall or if he did, it was only a minor injury and that the severe injury (T12 compression fracture) did not come from the fall on that day.

33     Regarding the fall, P said in his affidavit of evidence in chief, “_The pain to my back was not intense immediately after the accident. I was still able to get up with the help of Masud and continued walking to the inspection area. When the pain persisted and became stronger the next few days, I informed Masud and my supervisor by the name of Rashidul about my back pain. No arrangements were made for me to seek medical attention by my supervisor. I had to continue working while tolerating my back pain.”[^29]_ P said his complaints about his back pain after the accident “fell on deaf ears” and that, “This continued until 13.07.16.”[^30].

34     P explained that $30 would be deducted from his salary if he were absent from work and for this reason, he continued to work except when the pain was excruciating[^31]. He pointed to his salary slips showing a total deduction of $90 as supporting evidence of his allegation that he was absent from work for 3 days in the month of July 2016 due to the excruciating pain. P said he eventually decided to seek medical attention on his own at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital (“NTFH”), A & E Department on 13 July 2016 when he could no longer bear with the back pain.

35     As regards the Defendants’ allegation that P had turned up for work after the fall and did not seem to have difficulty coping with the work, P said he was doing only light duties such as “rolling the cables”[^32].

36     Regarding P’s testimony that he had informed his supervisor about his fall and his back pain, the Defendants’ only factual witness, Mr Fazli admitted that he was aware that P had informed his supervisor by the name of Rashidul[^33]. While Mr Fazli claimed that he had interviewed Rashidul about the accident[^34], no statement from Rashidul was recorded and the Defendants have not shown that they had made any effort to call Rashidul as a witness. I accept P’s explanation that his responsibility was only to inform his supervisor which he did and that it was his supervisor’s responsibility to inform his employer (D1) which is a reasonable position to take.[^35]

37     Based on all of the above, I am satisfied with the explanation given by P for the 3 weeks’ time gap between the accident and when P sought treatment at NTFH.

38     The Defendants also rely on their expert witness, Dr Chang Wei Chun to say that the injury allegedly suffered by P and for which P is claiming compensation for did not arise from the fall but was a pre-existing injury.

39     P’s clinical history is as set out in the table below.

40     I will now examine the evidence including the medical evidence and the opinions of the relevant medical experts to determine if it is more likely that the T12 compression fracture was the result of the fall or it is more likely to be the result of a pre-existing injury that had nothing to do with P’s fall from the accident.

41     When P went to NTFH on 13 July 2016 (some three weeks after the accident), he was diagnosed to suffer from “_grade 1 anterolisthesis of the L4 and L5 vertebrae, a compression fracture of the T12 vertebral body and some mild degenerative changes in lumbar spine region_.”[^38] Dr Chung Yan Ee Lynette (“Dr Chung”) prepared the medical reports dated 31st January 2017[^39] and 26th October 2018[^40] of the treating hospital (i.e., NTFH) based on available hospital documents such as discharge summaries and x-rays. The finding of grade 1 anterolisthesis of the L4 and L5 vertebra as well as the compression fracture of T12 were x-ray findings[^41]. Dr Chung did not examine P at all. It was also reported by Dr Chung that P was “discharged with topical and oral analgesia” and given “three days of outpatient sick leave and an outpatient appointment to be seen by the Orthopaedic, spine surgeons.” Dr Chung stated in her report that, “He was also advised to return if pain worsens, or if there was the presence of neurological deficits.”[^42]

42     In addition to Dr Chung’s report, P also relies on the medical reports prepared by Orthopaedic Specialist, Dr Lee Soon Tai dated 11 July 2017[^43], 21 August 2019[^44] and 23 August 2019[^45].

43     In disputing that the T12 compression fracture was caused by the fall, the Defendants rely on the opinion of Dr Chang Wei Chun’s (“Dr Chang”) as evidenced in Dr Chang’s medical reports dated 23 July 2019[^46] and 8 August 2019[^47]. On the basis of these two reports, the Defendants contend that P’s injury did not arise from the fall.

44     In Dr Chang’s 1st report of 23 July 2019[^48], he opined that, “_In the re-examination on 25.6.19, review of the x-rays of 13.7.16 performed at (NTFH) showed the T12 wedge compression fracture to be old and pre-existing. This would account for his lack of back pain around T12 when he presented at (NTFH) on 13.7.16.”[^49]_

45     In Dr Chang’s 2nd report of 8 August 2019, Dr Chang gave 3 reasons why the T12 compression fracture was considered old. He said, “_The fracture (Fig 1) was considered old as:- 1) The edges of the vertebral body were demarcated with cortical bone, which would take a long period of time to form. 2) Osteophyte had formed at the anterosuperior of the vertebral body. 3) Absence of soft tissue swelling around the vertebral body_.”[^50] For these reasons, Dr Chang opined that “_The features of the T12 vertebra on 13.7.16 would indicate the fracture was at least_ _5 to 6 months old or longer_”[^51] and that, “_The T12 fracture was old when seen on 13.7.16. It is not possible that the fracture was sustained after 24.6.16.”_[^52]_At the trial, Dr Chang reiterated a few times that the T12 compression fracture was an old injury, which could have been precipitated by the fall[^53]. (emphasis mine)_

46     I will now examine Dr Chang’s reasons for his opinion that the T12 fracture was an old, pre-existing injury that could not have been caused by the fall on 24 June 2016, one at a time. However, before I do that, I note that Dr Chang examined the Plaintiff only once - on 25 June 2019. He had also ordered the x-rays from NTFH taken on 13th July 2016 to be read by another radiologist appointed by him, Dr Santhosh Raj (“Dr Raj”) of Asiamedic Limited for a 2nd opinion and he also relies on Dr Raj’s report[^54]. As the Defendants did not call Dr Raj as their witness, I did not allow Dr Raj’s report to be admitted in evidence. However, Dr Chang’s contention that his opinion is supported by Dr Raj’s report is noted.

47     First, regarding Dr Chang’s contention that the injury was an old injury because of a lack of back pain around T12 when P presented at NTFH on 13 July 2016[^55], I note that this information about a lack of back pain is extracted from Dr Chung’s report of 31 January 2017, whereby it was stated, “_the Plaintiff was reviewed and had no pain__over the region of the fracture_.”[^56] I note however that it is not that P did not complain of back pain at all, because it was stated in Dr Chung’s report that P “_had felt that the pain was worsening over the last 2 days before the date of first presentation_” but that, P “_was reviewed and had no pain over the region of the fracture_.” (Emphasis mine)

48     At the trial, when questioned, Dr Chung said she was unable to tell the court how exactly the treating or examining doctor conducted the examination of P to arrive at the statement that there was no pain over the region of the fracture[^57]. At the trial, Dr Chung who based her opinion on the x-rays done at a time closest to the fall, also opined, “the radiologist did not make a comment on the age of the fracture” and that, in any event, “the radiologist would not be able to tell.”[^58]

49     On this aspect about a “lack of back pain around T12”, P’s expert witness, Dr Lee Soon Tai (“Dr Lee”) gave his opinion that often, the pain at T12 could only be elicited when the examiner percusses on the spinous process moving from top down to the bottom.

> _“A:_      _“……… My---in my experience for about 20 years in the university before I came out another 20 years, my main treatment is on osteoporosis compression fractures and in the tertiary centre we seen many times that patient with compression fracture at T12 L1 is based because they complain of pain in the low back region. In other words, sometimes, they do not complain of pain at the site of the fracture. You have to really suspect this and examine the patient carefully and I have written that during examination, the pain at T12 could then be elicited when the examiner percusses on the spinous process of T12, meaning that you use a finger, you knock on the spinous processes, you move down from the top down to the bottom and you will find that at the point where he had the injury, there will be pain when you knock, knock, knock, all the way every spinous process. So, I---I---I suspect this may not have been done and then you’ll just say that, “oh, it’s no pain”, you know? So that is my---my reply to this, uh, statement--_”[^59]

50     I note that the treating doctor only stated that there was no pain over the region of fracture but did not state how he elicited pain from P. Dr Lee also shared his view that as the method of examination is not revealed in the report of the treating hospital the conclusion is that the doctor did not elicit the pain through percussion down the spine.[^60] In the absence of any statement that percussion down the spine was done, I find no reason not to accept Dr Lee’s explanation as to the possible reason why it was initially reported that there was no pain around the region of the fracture.

51     Further, as pointed out by Dr Lee, I also note that the position of the T12 is at the top part of the lower back, just before the lumbar region[^61]. At the trial, Dr Lee has also explained that given the position of the T12, many times when that part is injured the patient would just say that he has low back pain and the fracture is likely to be missed[^62].

52     Based on all of the above, I find no reason to conclude that the T12 compression fracture did not come about from the accident on 24 June 2016 just because P did not complain of pain in the fracture region.

53     I will move on to examine the other reasons why Dr Chang said the T12 compression fracture was an old injury.

54     Commenting on Dr Chang’s opinion that the fractures were old because the edges of the vertebral body were demarcated with cortical bone which would have taken a long period of time to form, Dr Lee has explained that the fracture “is not only just the cortical bone but the inside bone as well” and that the MRI would give the most accurate picture[^63]. According to Dr Lee, the MRI which was done in October 2016, some four months after the accident, shows that the fracture was an “old fracture” because of the interval of 4 months; it is therefore this interval between the accident and the date of the MRI that accounts for why the MRI shows that the fracture was an “old fracture” and not because it was already “an old fracture” as at the time of the accident on 24 June 2016.

> “Q    So, based on the MRI re---ro---based on what your assessment of the images---

> A    Yah.

> Q    ---an you tell us what---what did you see?

> A    Well, it was old fracture by then. There were no changes of acute trauma at which it’s expected because it was done months after the injury. I think the injury was in July, is it?

> Q    June.

> A    June, uh, and that MRI is done was in---

> Q    October.

> A    October. So, it’s the interval of 4 months. So, you cannot see any new changes. Usually by---I don’t know s---6 weeks or 2 months there will be no real new changes. So, by 4 months definitely you cannot say whether it’s fresh or not.

> Q    Is that why in the---in the---in the radiological report, it’s referred to as a chronic fracture?

> A    Yah.”[^64]

55     As for the formation of osteophytes, Dr Lee was of the view that osteophyte had formed because of degenerative changes in the lumbar spine and not because of the T12 compression fracture being a pre-existing fracture[^65].

56     As for Dr Chang’s report that there was no soft tissue swelling at the vertebral body which formed the basis for Dr Chang to say that the fracture was a pre-existing fracture, Dr Lee opined that soft tissue swelling at the vertebral body would only happen if there was bleeding or if there was an infection. He explained that in a fracture that is inside the body normally there would be no soft tissue swelling.[^66]

57     In his evidence in court, Dr Chang further stated that the X-rays taken when P presented to NTFH, A&E Department for back pain, shows “a wedge compression fracture of T12”[^67] and he explained that, as “_the compression is in the front of the vertebral body_”, “_it would imply that the fracture was sustained with a sudden severe flexion force_”[^68]. He said, “_these sort of fractures are usually seen in automobile accidents whereby you are restrained in a seatbelt and your automobile rear ended another car and you are thrown forward_”[^69]. The crux of Dr Chang’s testimony in court is that the T12 fracture could not have occurred if P had fallen in the manner that he has described i.e., backwards[^70] and it was also for this reason that he says, the injury could not have been caused by the fall on 24 June 2016.

58     Under cross-examination, Dr Chang was however unable to explain why this aspect of his oral evidence in court was not included in his initial report when he saw P on 25th June 2017. He had known at that point of time about the details of the accident and he had also known about the T12 wedge compression fracture, yet it was not mentioned in his report that such a fracture could not have been caused by the way P allegedly fell.[^71] Dr Chang however conceded that a wedge compression fracture could arise if P had hit the pipes upon falling. He conceded that he has no evidence of the force with which P fell and hit the pipes[^72]. From this, I would infer that Dr Chang has no evidence upon which he can rely on to form an opinion as to whether the force of P’s fall was severe enough to cause a T12 compression fracture.

59     As the evidence and opinions of the other two experts (Dr Lee and Dr Chung) do not support Dr Chang’s opinion and testimony in court that the T12 compression could not have arisen from the fall on 24 June 2016, I find no basis to conclude that the T12 compression fracture could not have arisen from the accident on 24 June 2016.

60     Dr Chang also gave his opinion that a T12 compression fracture would have caused quite a bit of pain. As he was informed by the Defendants that P went back to his normal duties immediately after the accident, he opined that P could not have suffered a T12 compression fracture[^73]. With regard to this, I accept P’s explanation in court that though he was at work, he did not perform normal duties but was given light duties of rolling cables as he was in pain[^74]. As the Defendants have not produced any evidence to show that the Plaintiff went about his normal duties and did not show any sign of being in pain, there is also no reason why I should not accept P’s testimony at face value.

61     More importantly, in re-examination, Dr Lee further clarified that since P had not taken any home leave or medical leave for the preceding two years prior to the accident while being in the employment of D1; it is not likely that the T12 compression fracture was a pre-existing old fracture[^75]. P had been working with the Defendants for more than 9 years prior to the accident. If P had gone on medical leave for the T12 compression fracture prior to the accident, the Defendants ought to have been able to surface relevant evidence such as evidence of medical leave. Yet, the Defendants have tendered no evidence whatsoever, such as evidence of long medical leave, to substantiate their contention that P had sustained the T12 compression fracture injury before the accident.

62     Weighing Dr Lee’s explanation and Dr Chung’s opinion that it is not possible to tell the age of the fracture from the x-ray (and that, indeed, the radiologist did not state the age of the fracture) against the Defendants’ bare assertion that P had been injured with the T12 compression fracture for about 5 to 6 months or longer prior to the accident through Dr Chang’s opinion, I would give more weight to Dr Lee’s and Dr Chung’s opinions.

63     I therefore conclude that there is no basis for saying that the T12 compression fracture injury was not caused by the accident.

## Conclusion

64     In conclusion, the Defendants are liable for the injuries suffered by the Plaintiff. Both Defendants are concurrent tortfeasors in this case and they are jointly and severally liable to the Plaintiff. Interlocutory Judgment is hereby entered at 100% in the Plaintiff’s favour with damages to be assessed and costs reserved to the Registrar assessing the damages.
