Companies – Statutory derivative action

16 April 2021 - Judgment reserved.

### District Judge Lim Wen Juin:

1       In this application the applicant Dr Raveendran Rakesh seeks leave under s 216A of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) to bring an action in the name and on behalf of the second respondent Global Care Medical Pte Ltd (“the Company”) against the first respondent Jason Mike Nathan. Given that the first respondent is to be the defendant in the Company’s intended action I shall purely for convenience refer to him as “the defendant”. The applicant and the defendant are the only directors of the Company.

2       The applicant classifies into three categories the claims against the defendant that he would have the Company pursue in the intended action. The first category concerns the defendant’s alleged wrongdoing against the Company. The second and third categories concern alleged wrongdoing against two other companies, which are respectively J Five Pte Ltd (“J Five”) and Epicentre Medical Pte Ltd (“Epicentre”). The applicant contends that the Company may pursue the claims under the second category because it is undisputed that J Five was the “financial arm” of the Company and this means that J Five’s money was held on trust for the benefit of the Company, or at the very least that wrongdoing against J Five would indirectly cause harm to the Company. The applicant says that the Company may also pursue a claim under the third category because the wrongdoing against Epicentre indirectly caused harm to the Company.

3       The applicant would have the Company pursue a total of eight claims against the defendant under these three categories. These claims arise out of the following alleged acts of the defendant.

> (a)     Under the category of alleged wrongdoing against the Company:

>> (i)       Mismanaging the Company by failing to make and delaying payments to its suppliers and service providers;

>> (ii)       Misappropriating up to $148,791.87 in cash payments collected at the medical clinics operated by the Company;

>> (iii)       Misappropriating $35,000 by making unauthorised or unexplainable withdrawals from the Company’s bank account; and

>> (iv)       Improperly transferring $2,400 from the Company’s bank account to his sister.

> (b)     Under the category of alleged wrongdoing against J Five:

>> (i)       Misappropriating about $37,000 by making unauthorised or unexplainable withdrawals from J Five’s bank account;

>> (ii)       Improperly transferring about $44,000 to himself from J Five’s bank account; and

>> (iii)       Failing to maintain a bank account that J Five had with Maybank for the purpose of repaying a loan from Maybank.

> (c)     Under the category of alleged wrongdoing against Epicentre, mismanaging Epicentre by failing to make and delaying payments to its suppliers and service providers, thereby damaging indirectly the Company’s standing with its own suppliers and service providers which it had in common with Epicentre.

4       For the reasons to follow I grant the applicant leave to bring an action in the name and on behalf of the Company limited to the second, third and fourth claims under the first category – that is, the claims in \[3(a)(ii)\], \[3(a)(iii)\] and \[3(a)(iv)\] above. I do not grant leave in relation to the remaining claims.

## Factual background

5       The Company was in the business of operating medical clinics that offered services in the area of family medicine. It was incorporated on 24 May 2017 and was called Day & Night Family Clinic Pte Ltd before it assumed its current name on 14 July 2018. The Company was one component of a wider joint business venture between the applicant, who is a medical doctor, and the defendant, who is not – I shall for convenience refer to the applicant and the defendant collectively as “the parties”. There was a second medical doctor involved in the venture initially but he dropped out some months after the Company’s incorporation and no more mention need be made of him. At peak business activity the Company operated three clinics: in chronological order, the first at 77 Jalan Malu Malu (the “Jalan Malu Malu Clinic”) commenced operations in October 2017, the second in the Brooks II development at Springside Green (the “Brooks Clinic”) commenced operations in October 2018, and the third in the Coco Palms development at Pasir Ris Grove (the “Coco Palms Clinic”) commenced operations in February 2019.

6       The defendant is the Company’s most substantial shareholder, holding 46.1% of its issued shares, with the applicant not far behind on 44.1%. The remaining 9.8% of the Company’s shares is held by Epicentre, which was itself another component of the parties’ joint venture. The parties broadly agreed that the defendant would take charge of the Company’s general business operations, including its finances, management and administration, while the applicant would oversee the medical aspects of the business. The defendant however says that in reality there would be some degree of overlap in their roles and duties. Besides performing his executive duties the applicant also worked full-time as a general practitioner at the Jalan Malu Malu Clinic.

7       There is no doubt that the affairs of the Company were significantly intermingled with those of J Five, which had been incorporated on 14 January 2016. As with the Company the parties are the only two directors of J Five, but in J Five’s case the defendant is the sole shareholder. As alluded to earlier J Five was in some sense the “financial arm” of the Company. Prior to March 2018 the Company did not have any bank account of its own and parties agreed to use J Five’s bank account with DBS Bank Ltd (“DBS”) for making and receiving payments in connection with the Company’s business. For instance, the parties’ initial contributions of capital to the joint venture were paid into this account, and payments to suppliers of goods and services to the Company were made from the account. Eventually the Company opened three bank accounts with DBS at various times, one for each of its clinics. But even after it had done so the parties continued to use J Five and its DBS account for the Company’s purposes. All NETS payments made at the Jalan Malu Malu Clinic were received in J Five’s account, and the parties continued to use the funds in that account for some payments to the Company’s suppliers. Whenever the parties managed to attract investment in their joint venture from individuals or to obtain loans from banks or finance companies, the sums so invested or lent were paid into J Five’s account and J Five was the party to the investment or loan agreements. J Five was also the party to the tenancy agreement in respect of the Brooks Clinic even though the Company was the named tenant of the Jalan Malu Malu Clinic and the Coco Palms Clinic.

8       In addition to the Company and J Five, the parties’ joint venture encompassed two more companies, namely Epicentre and Afford Medical Pte Ltd, which were incorporated on 20 December 2018 and 2 July 2019 respectively. The parties are the only directors and shareholders of these two companies with the defendant holding a majority 51% stake in each company to the applicant’s 49%. The parties’ thinking was that these two companies would operate medical clinics like the Company, but do so according to a lower-cost business model. To this end the parties had Epicentre enter into three tenancy agreements around August and September 2019 with the intention of establishing clinics at Jurong East Street 31, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10 and Kian Teck Avenue, but only the first of these (the “Jurong Clinic”) ever came to fruition, commencing operations in October 2019. As for Afford Medical Pte Ltd, it never undertook any substantial business activity and so I need not say anything more about it.

9       After the parties’ joint venture had gone on for over two years it began to unravel towards the end of 2019. On 5 December 2019 the defendant travelled to Myanmar for business. The parties adopt divergent positions as to whether they were seeking to expand the territorial reach of their joint venture: the applicant says that any business transacted in Myanmar was entirely the defendant’s own, but the defendant says that it was the parties’ common aim to enter the Myanmar healthcare market. At any rate what is not controversial is that the defendant was detained on arrival by the authorities in Myanmar and was not released until 24 January 2020, and even then he was unable to return to Singapore until 12 March 2020. According to the defendant he had been framed by a Myanmar business partner. The applicant says that with the defendant uncontactable in detention he was compelled in the middle of December 2019 to take over the roles and duties in the parties’ joint venture in Singapore that had hitherto been the defendant’s, and in so doing had occasion to scrutinise for the first time various documents and records of the joint venture, whereupon he discovered evidence of the defendant’s misfeasance. On 21 January 2020 the applicant filed a police report alleging that the defendant had misappropriated more than $200,000 from the Company and J Five.

10     The parties had agreed in November 2019 to close the Brooks Clinic permanently due to poor business performance. Having filed the police report on 21 January 2020 the applicant took steps in the months that followed to shut down the other medical clinics of the parties’ joint venture except for the Jalan Malu Malu Clinic. He negotiated premature termination of tenancy agreements and cancelled contracts for utilities, telephone, Internet and other services in respect of the Coco Palms Clinic operated by the Company and the Jurong Clinic operated by Epicentre, as well as Epicentre’s two intended clinics that had not yet commenced operations. During this period the applicant and the defendant hardly communicated with each other. Each of them alleges that this was so despite their own readiness to reach out to the other to discuss the various issues surrounding their joint venture, and blames the other’s reticence for the lack of meaningful exchange between them.

11     The broader and more fundamental disagreement in the characterisation of these events in the first half of 2020 is that whereas the applicant says that he was simply excising loss-incurring parts of the parties’ joint venture to avert financial ruin, the defendant contends that the applicant was unilaterally and unjustifiably stemming a viable joint business in order that he might advance his own personal interests without regard for the defendant’s. In casting these aspersions on the applicant’s conduct the defendant relies on the incorporation of a company called New Path Family Clinic Pte Ltd (“New Path”) on 25 March 2020. The defendant’s case in outline is that the applicant has owned and controlled New Path from the outset but tried to hide that fact by removing all trace of himself from New Path’s public records soon after its incorporation, leaving his wife named officially as the company’s sole shareholder and director, and subsequently made attempts to have New Path take over the operation of the Jalan Malu Malu Clinic from the Company.

12     As for the police report that the applicant had lodged on 21 January 2020, on 14 May 2020 he was informed by the investigating officer that the Attorney-General’s Chambers would not be pressing criminal charges against the defendant. A few weeks later the defendant received a similar notification in the form of a letter dated 4 June 2020 from the investigating officer stating that the police had in consultation with the Attorney-General’s Chambers “decided not to take further action against \[him\] for the offence of Criminal Breach of Trust by Director”.

13     Meanwhile on 22 May 2020 the applicant’s solicitors sent a 13-page letter of demand to the defendant alleging that he had breached duties owed to the Company and J Five and had withdrawn sums of money from those companies’ bank accounts without authorisation or explanation, and had also failed to account properly for the Company’s cash earnings. The letter demanded that the defendant account for and return the withdrawn sums and missing cash earnings within 14 days. It also conveyed the applicant’s intention to resign as an employee of the Company upon the expiry of the tenancy agreement for the Jalan Malu Malu Clinic on 14 August 2020, and to be employed thereafter by New Path, which was described in this letter as a company that “has expressed interest on signing a new tenancy agreement with the landlord of the premises of the Jalan Malu Malu Clinic … after 14 August 2020”. The defendant proceeded to instruct solicitors and the parties’ solicitors exchanged several letters in June 2020.

14     On 9 July 2020 the applicant’s solicitors sent letters addressed to the Company’s board of directors and the defendant’s solicitors giving notice of the applicant’s intention “to commence a derivative action in the State Courts of Singapore under Section 216A(2) of the Companies Act” after 14 days if the Company’s board did not bring an action against the defendant. On the same day the applicant himself issued a letter convening a meeting of the Company’s directors on 17 July 2020. The parties duly met on the appointed day but were unable to resolve the disputes between them concerning their joint venture. The applicant then filed this application on 17 September 2020.

15     Although the applicant does not agree with the defendant’s description of the Company as a “dormant shell” in its present state, I think there can be no doubt that the Company is substantially inactive and has been ever since the Jalan Malu Malu Clinic ceased operations on 10 August 2020 and the tenancy agreement in respect of those premises lapsed on 14 August 2020. The applicant has gone on to become the medical director and resident family physician at New Path’s clinic at 926 Upper Thomson Road – despite the initial suggestions that New Path might be interested in taking over the premises of the Jalan Malu Malu Clinic it ultimately did not do so.

## Approach

16     It is not disputed that the applicant gave the 14 days’ notice required by s 216A(3)(_a_) of the Companies Act. What remains to be considered is whether the applicant “is acting in good faith” as required by s 216A(3)(_b_) and whether, as s 216A(3)(_c_) requires, it “appears to be prima facie in the interests” of the Company that its intended action against the defendant be brought.

17     I start by analysing whether the claims that the applicant would have the Company pursue in the intended action – summarised at \[3\] above – are “legitimate and arguable” to begin with, given that this is the “threshold” that must be crossed if I am to be satisfied that it is _prima facie_ in the Company’s interests that it pursue those claims: see the Court of Appeal decision of _Ang Thiam Swee v Low Hian Chor_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 2 SLR 340</span> (“_Ang Thiam Swee_”) at \[53\]. Next I consider whether it is _prima facie_ in the Company’s interests to pursue those claims I find to be legitimate and arguable – assuming there are any – and this may entail an examination of the “practical and commercial interests” of the Company and whether there are other adequate remedies available: _Ang Thiam Swee_ at \[56\]. If pursuing the claims would be in the Company’s interests the final step is to determine whether the applicant is acting in good faith.

## Whether the Company’s intended claims are legitimate and arguable

### Alleged wrongdoing against J Five

18     I address first the intended claims arising out of the defendant’s alleged wrongdoing against J Five – the second category of claims in the applicant’s taxonomy. The obvious difficulty in the applicant’s way is that the Company is in law a separate entity from J Five and so would ordinarily have neither the right to sue in respect of wrongs done to J Five nor a remedy in respect of losses sustained by J Five. This is so even though the business activities and the finances of the Company and J Five were very much intertwined. In this regard counsel for the defendant Ms Sheryl Ang relies on the Court of Appeal decision of _Goh Chan Peng and others v Beyonics Technology Ltd and another and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 592</span> (“_Beyonics_”) and I agree that it is instructive. In that case the Court of Appeal held that a holding company had no claim for lost profits where all of the relevant revenue was collected by one of its subsidiary companies and was booked in the subsidiary’s accounts. Even though the business of the holding company “was, in practical terms, wholly comprised of the businesses of its subsidiaries and it was in a position to control and direct the profits of its subsidiaries” (at \[73\]), the Court held that the loss of profits was suffered by the subsidiary only and “could not legally be transformed into” loss sustained by the holding company (at \[75\]). The Court of Appeal also made it clear that even when multiple companies are “organised as a single economic unit” they remain “discrete” entities with their own “rights and assets”, and “the doctrine of separate legal personality is not displaced” (at \[71\]).

19     In this case the relationship between the Company and J Five was not that of a holding company and a subsidiary. But I do not think that this fact allows _Beyonics_ to be distinguished. Rather, I think that the principles affirmed in _Beyonics_ mandate that the Company and J Five be treated as separate and distinct entities with their own assets and liabilities however much they might have functioned practically and economically as a single unit such that financial harm befalling one entity would indirectly damage the interests of another. Any misappropriation of J Five’s money by the defendant and any breach by him of directors’ duties owed to J Five would be a wrong done against J Five alone and cause actionable loss to J Five only, and would not give rise to any legitimate claim by the Company against the defendant.

20     At the hearing counsel for the applicant Mr Nicholas Tang sought to surmount the difficulty presented by the doctrine of separate legal personality by characterising the funds in J Five’s bank accounts as being held on trust for the Company and thus beneficially owned by the Company. So characterised any misappropriation of those funds would cause loss directly to the Company and constitute as much a wrong done to the Company as any misappropriation of money from a bank account in the Company’s name. Mr Tang submitted that the specific kind of trust over J Five’s funds was a _Quistclose_ trust. He could not realistically have asserted any other type of trust given that there was no evidence at all before me of the existence in this case of an express trust or of circumstances that could give rise to a resulting trust or an institutional constructive trust. On the basis of two High Court decisions that Mr Tang cited I accept that it is in principle possible for money held by a company and to all appearances belonging to that company to be subject to a _Quistclose_ trust – one was the decision of Belinda Ang Saw Ean J in _Pacific Rim Palm Oil Ltd v PT Asiatic Persada and others_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 4 SLR(R) 731</span> (“_Pacific Rim_”) and the other was the decision of Andrew Ang SJ in _MSP4GE Asia Pte Ltd and another v MSP Global Pte Ltd and others_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 1348</span> (“_MSP4GE_”).

21     But I am unable to accept that it is arguable that a _Quistclose_ trust existed in this case over J Five’s funds. The essence of a _Quistclose_ trust is that money is transferred or advanced on the basis that it will be “used exclusively for a specific purpose”, and in the absence of contrary intention on the part of the donor and recipient of the money the law implies “a stipulation that if the purpose fails the money will be repaid”: see _Pacific Rim_ at \[16\] and to similar effect _MSP4GE_ at \[106\]. If the purpose fails the money to be repaid is not merely a debt owed by the recipient to the donor but is held by the recipient on trust for the donor (see _Pacific Rim_ at \[20\]), with the result that an omission by the recipient to repay is a breach of trust (see _MSP4GE_ at \[113\]). Given that the notion of a “purpose” is central to a _Quistclose_ trust the purpose “must be stated with sufficient clarity for a court to determine if it is still capable of being carried out or if the money has been misapplied”: see _MSP4GE_ at \[106\].

22     In this case the applicant’s position appears to be that every cent in J Five’s bank accounts was held on trust for the Company. He could hardly take any other position given that there was no designation of any particular account as having been set aside for the Company’s benefit. I understand the applicant to say that all of J Five’s money had to be used exclusively for the business of the Company. But so far as the business of the Company is framed as the purpose for which J Five received its money, I think that this is far too unclear and open-ended a purpose on which to found a _Quistclose_ trust. The facts of _Pacific Rim_ and _MSP4GE_ illustrate this point by way of contrast, in that the purposes that grounded _Quistclose_ trusts in those cases were much narrower and more specific: in _Pacific Rim_ it was to settle debts owed by certain debtors to a certain creditor (at \[28\]), and in _MSP4GE_ the money in question was meant to be a deposit until the donor “decided to place a second order” with the recipient and to be returned to the donor if the order did not materialise (at \[113\]).

23     Contemplated within the wide rubric of the business of the Company would be all sorts of expenditure, including payments to suppliers of goods or services, payments to landlords for premises rented, and repayments to lenders in respect of loans taken. If J Five was completely at liberty to apply the money in its bank accounts towards any such item of expenditure, as it would be if the only fetter on its use of the money was that it had to be for the business of the Company, it seems to me that the money was effectively and practically at the “free disposal” of J Five and this is fundamentally at odds with the existence of a _Quistclose_ trust (see _MSP4GE_ at \[106(d)\]). Recognising a _Quistclose_ trust where one company receives money from another for the broad and nebulous purpose of the latter’s general business use would in my opinion make it much too easy for companies operating together as a single economic unit to circumvent the doctrine of separate legal personality and the principles articulated in _Beyonics_, and hence cannot be correct.

24     The parties in this case chose to have J Five receive and pay out funds for various transactions related to their joint venture. Whether or not it was the parties’ intention to do so, the effect of this choice was to insulate the Company financially in respect of these transactions. For example, the result of having J Five borrow $200,000 from Maybank was that J Five and not the Company would be liable to repay Maybank. Although Maybank could call on the guarantees that the applicant and the defendant gave personally in respect of the loan, the applicant has not suggested that Maybank would be legally entitled to demand payment from the Company. It seems to me that if the applicant would have the Company take the benefit of immunity from J Five’s creditors, as it is wholly within his rights to do, he must accept all the consequences of the structure that he and the defendant put in place for their joint venture. One such consequence is that J Five’s money is its own and the Company has in legal and equitable terms no title to it. I therefore conclude that the Company has no legitimate and arguable claims against the defendant in respect of the alleged wrongdoing against J Five.

### Alleged mismanagement of payments to suppliers

25     Next I consider together the claims that relate to the defendant’s alleged mismanagement of the Company and Epicentre by failing to make or delaying payments to suppliers of goods and services – the first claim under the first category and the sole claim under the third category according to the applicant’s taxonomy. The applicant says that the Company’s administrative staff would prepare cheques for the defendant’s signature in order that these payments to suppliers could be made, and the defendant was the only individual who could sign the cheques because they would be issued from J Five’s account and he was the sole signatory, but he would often delay signing or not sign at all. The applicant says that as at 31 December 2019 the Company owed about $136,000 and Epicentre owed around $33,000 to their suppliers and service providers, and a large part of this debt had remained unpaid for more than 60 days from the time that it became due.

26     The defendant has advanced various reasons why these late payments or non-payments to suppliers were not caused by any breach of duty on his part, including that he was simply following a system he had agreed with the applicant for ascribing relative priority to the debts incurred by the Company and Epicentre, and that he would have made most of the payments but for his detention in Myanmar for which he cannot reasonably be faulted. But I think I need not discuss them in any detail because I find determinative a separate point that he has raised, which is that it is not apparent that the Company would have any non-negligible remedy even if it establishes these alleged breaches of duty by him. Put another way, it is not clear that failing to make or delaying payments to suppliers caused the Company any appreciable loss. The applicant says that some suppliers “warned that they would impose late payment interest”, but there is no suggestion that the Company in fact had to pay interest or any other fees connected to late payment. The applicant adds that suppliers would “constantly chase for payment of their invoices” and the Company’s administrative staff “had to field these chasers constantly”, but there is no evidence that this diversion of staff time had any real financial impact on the Company.

27     The most tangible allegation of loss that the applicant has offered is that around October or November 2019 the Company’s “primary supplier of drugs” Zuellig Pharma Pte Inc “banned the Company from placing further orders because of non-payment” and “rejected the placement of any orders whenever the staff tried to order drugs”. But what is absent is an explanation as to how this ban led to the Company sustaining substantial financial harm. There is no evidence for instance that the Company had to obtain its drugs at a higher price from an alternative supplier, or that its clinics were unable to serve as many patients due to a shortage of drugs and thereby lost revenue it would have earned had the supply continued uninterrupted. Given that this ban occurred just a few months before the parties’ joint venture started to come apart, it may well be that the Company had by that time an adequate stockpile of drugs to see it through the remainder of the time during which its clinics were in operation. Thus even on a _prima facie_ standard there is no reason for me to think that the ban caused the Company any actual loss.

28     Mr Tang submits that the Company’s recalcitrance in making payments would naturally cause a permanent diminution of its goodwill and reputation among its suppliers. But I agree with Ms Ang that the fact that the Company is no longer undertaking any business activity means that any such diminution has ceased to be material. So far as Mr Tang suggests that the Company could resume operations and become once more a going concern, in that the defendant could bring in other medical doctors to work with and open new clinics under the auspices of the Company, here again I agree with Ms Ang’s response, which is that this is not at all a realistic prospect. I think it clear that the Company was meant from its inception to be a vehicle for the parties’ joint business venture and is as such tied intimately to the identities of these individuals. Now that the relationship between the parties has turned acrimonious and the applicant has gone his own way with New Path I regard the possibility of future resuscitation of the Company as extremely remote. This being so it seems to me that any adverse effect on the Company’s reputation arising from non-payments or delayed payments to suppliers has not caused the Company any loss that would warrant an award of damages.

29     Hence I conclude that even if the Company can show that the defendant breached his duties to it in failing to make or delaying payments to its suppliers, the Company will not recover anything more than nominal damages. As for the defendant’s alleged failure to pay Epicentre’s suppliers in time or at all, the applicant argues that even though this allegation pertains to Epicentre’s business it is nonetheless actionable by the Company because Epicentre was inextricably linked to the Company in the eyes of their common suppliers, and any damage to Epicentre’s reputation as a customer would harm the Company’s reputation indirectly. Even if I accept that indirect harm to the Company would confer on it the right to sue the defendant for wrongdoing against Epicentre – given the principles in _Beyonics_ I find this proposition a dubious one – for the reasons earlier given I do not think it possible to establish that element of indirect harm. Therefore the applicant’s allegations of the defendant’s mismanagement in paying the suppliers of the Company and Epicentre do not in my view disclose any legitimate or arguable claims by the Company against the defendant.

### Alleged wrongdoing against the Company

#### Alleged misappropriation of cash payments

30     I turn now to the allegation that the defendant misappropriated $148,791.87 in cash from the Company’s clinics, that is the Jalan Malu Malu Clinic, the Brooks Clinic and the Coco Palms Clinic – the second claim under the first category according to the applicant’s taxonomy. The applicant explained that each of those clinics had a safe, and at the end of each day the staff at each clinic would place in the safe all cash received on the day as well as that day’s sales report. The cash so received and collected would be counted at the end of each month and be compared with the amounts recorded in the daily sales reports. Some of the cash would be used to pay expenses such as remuneration for part-time staff and locum doctors or small-value purchases of office supplies and cleaning equipment, and to refill the clinic’s petty-cash reserve. According to the applicant the cash that remained was supposed to be deposited in the DBS account maintained by the Company for that clinic, save that in the case of the Jalan Malu Malu Clinic it appears that the cash was deposited in J Five’s bank account in the first year of the clinic’s operations. The applicant says that the defendant bore primary responsibility for counting the cash and depositing it in the appropriate bank account.

31     What seems clear enough is that almost $150,000 of cash recorded in the daily sales reports is _prima facie_ unaccounted for. As Mr Tang’s colleague Ms Jolene Gwee explained at the hearing, exhibited in the applicant’s first affidavit (at pp 619, 759 and 832) are tables, one per clinic, setting out (a) the amounts of cash received each month by that clinic according to the daily sales reports, (b) the amounts of cash paid out each month by that clinic according to the payment voucher records, (c) the difference between the amounts of cash received and paid out each month representing the amount of cash that ought to have been deposited in that clinic’s account for that month, and (d) the amounts actually deposited each month in that clinic’s DBS account. It appears from these tables that the amounts actually deposited were less than the amounts that ought to have been deposited, the cumulative shortfalls being $112,550.17 at the Jalan Malu Malu Clinic, $24,120.15 at the Coco Palms Clinic, and $12,121.55 at the Brooks Clinic. The means by which these figures were computed strike me as sound, and Ms Ang acknowledged at the hearing that the evidence to which the defendant currently has access would not cast doubt on those figures. Thus I am satisfied on a _prima facie_ basis that $148,791.87 in cash belonging to the Company is missing.

32     The defendant accepts that since May 2018 he has taken about $62,000 in cash from the Company without documenting it. He says that he took this money pursuant to an unwritten “shared understanding” with the applicant that each of them “could draw around S$50,000.00 to S$80,000.00 in additional remuneration or management / director fees per annum, over and above \[their\] monthly salaries”. As for the balance of $86,000 or so, he says that as far he knows this could have been left in the clinics’ safe deposit boxes or cash boxes. He denies that there was any practice of depositing cash in the Company’s bank accounts and says that the parties had instead “decided to keep the excess cash earnings” in those boxes. The defendant alleges that the applicant was in any case “more often than not present and involved in the counting of the clinics’ cash earnings each month”, the suggestion being that the applicant has no right to complain about supposed irregularities in the counting process and discrepancies in the cash-related accounts. At the hearing Ms Ang pointed out that even on the applicant’s own evidence the cash counted would not always tally with what was recorded in the daily sales reports, meaning that there might be quite innocent explanations for any apparent shortfalls.

33     Although the defendant’s explanations are not so implausible that they can be rejected outright, all that has to be established against him is a legitimate and arguable case and I do not think that he has conclusively refuted the applicant’s allegations. Considering first the $62,000 that the defendant took without documentation, the applicant is adamant that there was no “shared understanding” that either of them could unilaterally help themselves to money from the Company beyond their usual salaries. I see no way that I can determine this disputed issue at this stage. It is common ground that the applicant would receive, in addition to his monthly salary of $12,000, payments from the Company recorded as being for services rendered as a locum doctor at the Company’s clinics. These payments were of a fixed sum per month, initially $2,800 and then $3,800 from the middle of 2019. The defendant argues that these payments could not have been for genuine locum services because they did not vary in amount even though it would be expected that the applicant would not work exactly the same number of hours as a locum doctor every month, and he received the same amount even in months when he went on overseas holidays including November and December 2019, and arithmetically it would mean that the applicant provided locum services for 12 to 15 hours per week on top of the 48-hour work week for which he was paid his monthly salary, which the defendant contends is unlikely. But the applicant has explained that the fixed monthly amount was derived from a historical average of the number of hours he spent doing locum work, and that he would in fact spend about 60 hours a week on his medical work at the clinics. Hence it is at least arguable that the additional payments received by the applicant were really for locum services, and if that is so the mere existence of those payments would not support the “shared understanding” that the defendant alleges to justify his taking of cash from the Company. Furthermore, the fact is that the payments to the applicant were documented but the defendant’s takings were not, and this difference seems inconsistent with any “shared understanding” between them. The point is that it is not possible to make firm findings without a trial.

34     As for the $86,000 or so in cash unaccounted for that is left after subtracting the $62,000 that the defendant took, I think it is a triable issue whether the defendant misappropriated this. It is true that the amount of cash counted could not always be reconciled perfectly with the daily sales reports, but as the defendant accepts the differences were “not large e.g. a few hundred dollars a month”, meaning that as a matter of arithmetic these differences would at most result in shortfalls in the region of $3,000 to $4,000 per clinic each year and would explain only a small fraction of the missing $86,000. So far as the defendant says that there was no practice of depositing cash in the Company’s bank accounts, I agree with the applicant’s argument that this does not seem all that likely given the sheer amount of physical space that the currency notes and coins would have occupied, and so far as the defendant says that the applicant was also very much involved in counting the cash at the clinics each month, this is squarely disputed by the applicant and I am in no position now to decide where the truth lies. What it comes to is that there is $86,000 in cash missing for which no satisfactory explanation has so far emerged, and it is arguable that the defendant oversaw the process of counting cash and depositing it in the Company’s bank accounts such that he would be best-placed to provide an explanation for the cash that is unaccounted for. In these circumstances I consider the applicant’s allegation that the defendant misappropriated that $86,000 a not untenable one. In the result I am satisfied that the Company has a legitimate and arguable claim that the defendant misappropriated from it a sum of $148,791.87 in cash.

#### Withdrawals and transfers from the Company’s bank accounts

35     The final claims to consider concern alleged misappropriation by the defendant of money from the Company’s bank accounts – the third and fourth claims under the first category according to the applicant’s taxonomy. It is not disputed that from the Company’s DBS account for the Jalan Malu Malu Clinic the defendant withdrew $5,000 on 28 June 2018, $5,000 on 17 July 2018 and $25,000 on 5 October 2018. It is also not disputed that on 27 February 2020 a sum of $2,400 was transferred to the defendant’s sister from the Company’s DBS account for the Coco Palms Clinic with the transaction described as “Salary Payment” in the bank statements.

36     In relation to the sums of $5,000 withdrawn on 28 June and 17 July 2018 the defendant states that he cannot recall what these withdrawals were for, but he contends the applicant is not entitled to complain about them because the applicant signed off on the Company’s financial statements for the period from 24 May 2017 to 31 July 2018 and would in so doing have examined the Company’s bank statements for June and July 2018 and seen the two withdrawals recorded there, yet he did not make any enquiries about the withdrawals then. But the applicant’s point is that the Company’s documents, including “payment vouchers, payment records, invoices or board approvals”, do not “support or justify” the withdrawals. If indeed the defendant withdrew the sums without authorisation or valid reason I do not think the mere fact that the applicant signed off on the financial statements for the period within which the withdrawals took place would afford the defendant a substantive defence. It does not without more amount to ratification or retrospective authorisation of the withdrawals. Leaving aside what appears to be the applicant’s denial that he signed the financial statements at all, in my understanding the defendant would have to go further and show either that the applicant had positively waived the Company’s right to challenge the withdrawals or that the applicant’s conduct in signing off on the financial statements was relied on by the defendant to his detriment such as to give rise to an estoppel, and there is at this juncture no evidence before me of either possibility. Hence I think it arguable that the defendant made the two withdrawals of $5,000 each without possessing any right to do so and that the Company can recover the sum of $10,000 from him.

37     As for the sum of $25,000 withdrawn on 5 October 2018 from the Company’s DBS account for the Jalan Malu Malu Clinic, the defendant’s explanation for this comprises three parts. He says that he returned $5,635 to the same account on the same day, that he deposited $10,000 in J Five’s DBS account also on the same day, and that he passed the remaining $9,365 to the applicant as “part of the profits earned by the Company in the financial year 2017 to 2018”. I deal with each part in this sequence.

38     It is evident from the bank statements that $5,635 was indeed deposited in the Company’s DBS account for the Jalan Malu Malu Clinic on 5 October 2018, but I think this generates more questions than it provides answers because it does not seem sensible to remove a sizeable sum of money only to put it back almost at once. The applicant says that in fact he gave the defendant this sum of $5,635 in cash with instructions to deposit it into the Company’s account because the applicant had used the Company’s credit card around 25 September 2018 to make a personal purchase of computer equipment for $5,635.69 and wished to reimburse the Company for it. The defendant’s response is that the applicant never gave him the $5,635, and that he – the defendant – deposited that sum in the Company’s account on the faith of the applicant’s promise of repayment that was not ultimately kept. I am constrained to say that I find it somewhat suspicious that the defendant made his allegation of non-payment by the applicant only after the applicant had put forward his account of wanting to repay the Company for computer equipment purchased with its funds. But I need not go so far as to disbelieve the defendant. It suffices that notwithstanding the defendant’s version of events I consider that the fate of $5,635 out of the $25,000 withdrawn on 5 October 2018 remains shrouded in mystery given that the applicant has furnished a different plausible explanation for the deposit of $5,635, and that it is arguable that the defendant misappropriated it.

39     It is equally evident from the bank statements that $10,000 was indeed deposited in J Five’s DBS account on 5 October 2018. But I think the applicant is right to say that this does not resolve the issue. Earlier I mentioned (at \[31\]) the tables exhibited in the applicant’s first affidavit setting out, among other things, the amounts actually deposited each month in the DBS accounts for each of the Company’s clinics. The table for the Jalan Malu Malu Clinic records that $10,000 was deposited in J Five’s DBS account in October 2018. Given that the bank statements for J Five’s DBS account show no other deposit of cash into the account in October 2018, or for that matter in the adjacent months of September and November 2018 as far as I can tell, I think the applicant is correct to assert that the $10,000 deposit recorded in the table must refer to the deposit made on 5 October 2018. This gives rise to two possibilities. One is that the $10,000 deposited had its source in the $25,000 that the defendant withdrew from the Company’s DBS account for the Jalan Malu Malu Clinic but was erroneously assumed to consist of cash received at that clinic. This would mean that the amount of cash received at the clinic and thereafter deposited in the Company’s DBS account was in fact $10,000 less than what it was thought to be, and this would increase by $10,000 the unexplained shortfall between the amount of cash actually deposited and the amount that ought to have been deposited. The other possibility is that this $10,000 deposited was in fact cash received at the Jalan Malu Malu Clinic, in which case it would follow that the defendant was inaccurate in his explanation that it originated from the $25,000 withdrawn from the Company’s account on 5 October 2018. Either way $10,000 of the Company’s money is not accounted for. That being so the fate of $10,000 out of the $25,000 withdrawn on 5 October 2018 likewise remains mysterious and it is arguable that the defendant misappropriated it.

40     As for the $9,365 that the defendant says that he gave to the applicant as payment out of the Company’s profits, the applicant “categorically” denies that he received that sum from the defendant. It appears to be common ground that the applicant’s share of the Company’s profits for the financial period that ended 31 July 2018 would have been $7,424.48 instead of $9,365, but the defendant says that he “allowed \[the applicant\] to take a bigger portion of the profit for that year” because the applicant had said he “needed money then for some personal reasons”. Once more it seems somewhat suspicious that the defendant’s explanation emerged in a belated manner only after the applicant observed that his share of the profits would not have equalled $9,365. But as before I need not disbelieve the defendant. It is enough to say that there is a dispute as to the disposal of that $9,365 that cannot be determined without a trial, and it is arguable that the defendant misappropriated it.

41     What is left to consider is the sum of $2,400 that was transferred to the defendant’s sister on 27 February 2020. The defendant accepts that this money ultimately ended up with him and he contends that he was entitled to receive it as remuneration due to him from the Company. He says that he needed his sister to receive it because his own bank account had been “temporarily frozen as a consequence” of the police report that the applicant had made on 21 January 2020. Against this the applicant argues that the defendant had no right to receive any remuneration because he had been detained in Myanmar since 5 December 2019 while there for reasons unrelated to the parties’ joint venture and so had not done any work for the Company since then. Although my understanding of the law is that subject to any contrary provision in the employment agreement an employee who has engaged in misconduct or is suspected of having done so ordinarily continues to be entitled to receive their salary so long as their employment has not been terminated, in this case the parties did not have written employment contracts with the Company, meaning that in the circumstances prevailing in January and February 2020 the defendant’s employment status and his right to receive remuneration could have been matters of some ambiguity. It therefore seems to me arguable that the defendant had no entitlement to receive payment of the $2,400 transferred out of the Company on 27 February 2020.

42     I conclude that the Company has legitimate and arguable claims that the defendant misappropriated $35,000 that he withdrew from the Company’s bank accounts over three occasions in 2018 as well as a sum of $2,400 that was paid out from the Company around the end of February 2020. This is in addition to its legitimate and arguable claim that the defendant misappropriated $148,791.87 in cash from its clinics.

## Interests of the Company

43     The legitimate and arguable claims that the Company has against the defendant thus involve a total sum just above $186,000. The defendant advances a number of reasons why it would nevertheless not be in the interests of the Company to pursue those claims. First, the Company is no longer carrying on any business and is unlikely to be rehabilitated as a going concern, and the only persons who stand to gain from litigating those claims are the parties themselves given that they are directly and indirectly the Company’s only shareholders. Second, the cost to the Company of litigating those claims would be disproportionate to the possible benefit it might recover from the defendant in the litigation. Third, it could cause the Company to become mired in multiple proceedings, in that the defendant alleges that the Company has legitimate and arguable claims against the applicant for mismanaging it and setting up a competing business in the form of New Path and says that allowing the intended action against him to proceed could prompt him to get the Company to sue the applicant in turn. Fourth, there is available a more appropriate remedy for the applicant’s true grievances, that remedy being the winding-up of the Company.

44     Although I agree that the Company is now inactive and is not likely to become active again, it does not follow that it would not be in the Company’s interests to seek redress for arguable historical wrongdoing against it. It could by bringing the intended action gain an award of damages in the region of $186,000. If it is insolvent that gain can be made available to its creditors, and if it is solvent the gain could be distributed to the shareholders. Given that the applicant is a substantial shareholder together with the defendant the intended action will not simply be a futile exercise of retrieving money from the defendant only to pay it back to him in his capacity as a shareholder. I regard it as being in the Company’s interests to pay debts owed to creditors to the fullest extent possible and to maximise distributions to its shareholders.

45     There is no question that assessing the interests of the Company entails some sort of cost-benefit analysis. While the potential gain of $186,000 may not be a very large sum it is no paltry amount either. The defendant however suggests that much expense will be incurred in bringing the intended action because it “will in all likelihood be complex” given that in this application “a total of 9 affidavits spanning 3155 pages have been filed”. It is true that the factual material filed in this application has been voluminous, but I do not think the complexity of the case should be overstated. To begin with the scope of the intended action has been reduced given my finding that the Company has no legitimate and arguable claims in respect of all the alleged wrongdoing against J Five and Epicentre and the alleged wrongdoing against the Company that consists of failing to make or delaying payments to its suppliers. I believe the case is significantly simpler now that there will be no need to scrutinise J Five’s financial transactions. Moreover, much of the factual material in this application was I think directed towards providing comprehensive context and background to the parties’ joint venture. When it comes to the key disputed issues in the intended action, for example whether there was any “shared understanding” that the parties could unilaterally withdraw money from the Company in addition to their usual salary, or what became of the $25,000 that the defendant withdrew on 5 October 2018, I think that only a small proportion of the factual material will be directly and squarely probative of those issues.

46     Ms Ang emphasises that the applicant has not given any undertaking to ensure that the Company “would be entirely insulated from any costs of the action” such as was furnished in _Ma Wai Fong Kathryn v Trillion Investment Pte Ltd and others_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 5 SLR 1374</span> (at \[26\]), and that the applicant is on the contrary asking in this application for an order that the Company bear all the costs of the intended action on an indemnity basis. While these are no doubt factors to be reckoned with in the cost-benefit analysis, I think that it is open to me to adopt as a starting point the need for the Company to pursue legitimate and arguable claims and thereafter endeavour to mitigate any possible cost to the Company by making an appropriate order on costs.

47     The defendant alleges that the applicant has himself committed wrongs against the Company. One such alleged wrong is that he took unilateral steps in 2020 to shut down the Coco Palms Clinic and then the Jalan Malu Malu Clinic even though they were or could have been profitable. Another is that by practising at New Path’s clinic on Upper Thomson Road the applicant breached an obligation in a confidentiality agreement that he had signed not to practise “within a radius of five (5) km from \[the Company\] where \[he\] has been practising for the substantial part of his/her service in the 12 months preceding the date of notice, for a period of one (1) year from the determination of this Agreement”. I think this latter allegation is built on shaky foundations because the applicant has shown objective map-based evidence that New Path’s clinic is more than 5 km away from the Jalan Malu Malu Clinic, and so far as the defendant says that New Path’s clinic is “less than 1km away from the Brooks Clinic” I am not sure why that is relevant given that the Brooks Clinic ceased operations in November 2019 and I cannot discern any legitimate interest the Company would have in enacting an area of prohibition around a clinic that is no longer there. But even if these allegations disclosed arguable claims by the Company against the applicant I consider it material that to date the defendant appears not to have taken any real step towards getting the Company to sue the applicant. This for me produces doubt as to whether the defendant honestly believes that the applicant has done wrong against the Company.

48     Ms Ang argues that I should follow the approach of the Court of Appeal in _Pang Yong Hock and another v PKS Contracts Services Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 3 SLR(R) 1</span> (“_Pang Yong Hock_”). In that case the Court of Appeal upheld the decision of Choo Han Teck J below dismissing the application for leave under s 216A of the Companies Act. One reason Choo J had given for dismissing it was that allowing it would have led to “the prospect of two sets of directors each suing and counter-suing in the name of the company”, and that would be “inappropriate, if not farcical” (at \[13\]). The Court of Appeal agreed that “the prospect of the company suing each faction with the respective suits being driven by the opposing faction was a real possibility” (at \[24\]). Ms Ang submits that it would in the same vein be “inappropriate” and “farcical” in this case for the Company to be suing both the defendant and the applicant, and that this militates against granting the applicant the leave that he seeks. But I think that there is a significant point of distinction between _Pang Yong Hock_ and this case. In _Pang Yong Hock_ the faction of shareholders-directors applying for leave to sue in the company’s name was relying on a special accountant’s report to mount a case against the faction it desired to sue. But as the Court of Appeal observed, if that report made out a case “it was against all the four shareholder-directors” (at \[23\]), meaning that the faction applying for leave would be implicated by the same report it was invoking. It was in that context that the Court of Appeal held that the prospect of suits and counter-suits between opposing factions was a “real” enough one that it would not be in the company’s interests to grant leave to the faction applying for it. In this case, on the other hand, the evidence relied on by the applicant to establish the defendant’s alleged wrongdoing does not itself point to wrongdoing on the applicant’s part. Given also the absence of any serious effort by the defendant to proceed against the applicant, the possibility of a “farcical” outcome of suit and counter-suit seems much more remote in this case than in _Pang Yong Hock_.

49     In these circumstances I think I am free to weigh the factors in this case in a manner different from that in _Pang Yong Hock_. To hold that it would not be in the interests of the Company to bring the intended action against the defendant because the defendant might react by having the Company bring an action against the applicant when the defendant has thus far demonstrated no perceptible intention of doing so would be tantamount to excusing an arguable wrongdoer just because he issues a belated threat to retaliate against those who seek to hold him to account. I think that it cannot be in the Company’s interests to yield so easily to such a threat.

50     There is no doubt that I have to consider “whether there is another adequate remedy available, such as the winding up of the company” (_Pang Yong Hock_ at \[22\]). Ms Ang submits that it is likely the Company would be wound up on the ground that it is just and equitable to do so, given that the Company was “effectively a quasi-partnership” between the applicant and the defendant but the relationship between the parties is now “highly acrimonious and without any hope for reconciliation”, and that falling-out has also meant that the Company’s substratum, meaning the “main object which it was formed to achieve”, has been “completely eroded”. I am prepared to accept that all this is correct. But I do not think it follows that I should for that reason decline to grant the applicant the leave he seeks. In the first place, I understand that no winding-up application has been made and so there is no live conflict between alternative remedies. Also, even though the winding-up remedy might in principle be available to the Company, I do not see why it would not be in the Company’s interests for the time being for the applicant to be granted leave to bring the intended action against the defendant. If a winding-up application is subsequently made and a winding-up order results, I think that the liquidator would be free to adopt or abandon that action on the basis of the liquidator’s own cost-benefit analysis. I do not believe that my grant of leave would constrain the liquidator in any way. For this reason the susceptibility of the Company to being wound up does not in my opinion impart any countervailing detriment to the present pursuit of legitimate and arguable claims.

51     I am therefore not persuaded by the defendant’s arguments and am satisfied that it is _prima facie_ in the interests of the Company to bring an action against the defendant to pursue the claims that I have found to be legitimate and arguable. That said, I do accept the defendant’s point that there is a need to keep in check the Company’s liability for costs in bringing the action, and so I do not think it is appropriate at this stage to give the applicant a blanket indemnity from the Company for such costs. If for instance some or all of the Company’s claims are eventually dismissed and it has to pay costs to the defendant, I am not sure that it would be fair to place the burden of payment on the Company rather than the applicant. I prefer to keep this point open by reserving the question of indemnification to the trial judge hearing the intended action.

## The applicant’s good faith

52     It is the applicant’s burden to establish good faith on his part: see _Ang Thiam Swee_ at \[23\]. In my understanding this entails at heart an examination of his beliefs and purposes in making this application. This examination should be directed towards two questions, the first being whether the applicant honestly and reasonably believes that the Company has a good cause of action, and the second being whether he is so driven by collateral purposes unconnected to doing justice to the Company that it amounts to an abuse of process: see _Ang Thiam Swee_ at \[27\] and \[29\]–\[30\].

53     As alluded to earlier (at \[11\]), the defendant’s case in this regard is that the applicant has made this application to advance his own personal interests. The defendant submits that the applicant “took advantage” of the defendant’s detention in Myanmar and months-long absence from Singapore from December 2019 to March 2020 and “surreptitiously commenced a campaign to systemically oust the \[defendant\] from and/or dismantle the Joint Business that parties had painstakingly built up over the past few years”. When the Jalan Malu Malu Clinic was left as the “sole surviving business operation” in the parties’ joint venture the applicant tried to “stage a coup d’état by taking over and continuing business operations in the exact same location under his own competing company, New Path, to the exclusion of the \[defendant\] and the other entities in the Joint Business” including the Company. The defendant says that in so doing the applicant has breached the fiduciary duties that he owed to the Company, and that in making this application the applicant’s objectives include “\[e\]xtracting as much value as he possibly can from the Company in its end days, perhaps to safeguard his own financial position” in anticipation of calls on personal guarantees he previously gave, and “\[c\]ompleting the process of washing his hands off the Company and the Joint Business”. The defendant also suggests that the applicant is attempting to evade his own responsibility for the failure of the Company’s business. Faced with the ire and anger of investors who put sizeable sums of money into the parties’ joint venture – one investor agreed to contribute $300,000, two $200,000 each, and one $75,000, all paid to J Five – the defendant alleges that the applicant is in making this application seeking to deflect all fault and negative attention to the defendant.

54     I think that the most challenging point for the applicant is that he was not entirely candid about his involvement in New Path. On the basis of evidence adduced by the defendant it is clear that at the time of New Path’s incorporation on 25 March 2020 both the applicant and his wife were named as its only shareholders and directors, and its registered address was 77 Jalan Malu Malu, which is also the registered address of the Company and the location of the Jalan Malu Malu Clinic. Although the applicant ceased on 12 May 2020 to be a shareholder and director of New Path, given that no new person was brought into the fold and the applicant’s wife was left as sole shareholder and director, I have little doubt that despite this apparent development the applicant intended to retain a beneficial interest in New Path and continue to direct its business affairs. Yet, as the defendant correctly points out, in the letter of demand dated 22 May 2020 sent by the applicant’s solicitors the impression created was that the relationship between the applicant and New Path was merely that of an employee and employer. I find that the applicant was deliberately coy about his stake in and control over New Path.

55     Objectionable as this lack of candour might be when viewed in isolation, in assessing the applicant’s beliefs and purposes I think I should look at all the circumstances of the case in a holistic manner. As Mr Tang submits, it is necessary to appreciate that the applicant did not begin to sever ties with the defendant until he was forced to take on the defendant’s usual executive duties by reason of the defendant’s detention in Myanmar from 5 December 2019. I am inclined to believe that the applicant had hitherto devoted most of his time to his medical practice within the parties’ joint venture and had but limited time left over for the management and administration of the business. Having had a closer look at the records of the Company the applicant promptly lodged a police report on 21 January 2020 alleging that the defendant had misappropriated sums from the Company with the “suspected amount misappropriated via bank account \[being\] SGD 45,500” and the “cash earnings misappropriated \[being\] more than SGD 140,000”. These amounts are similar to the sums involved in the intended claims against the defendant that I have found legitimate and arguable, and therefore I think that it was entirely reasonable for the applicant to have been exercised by possible misfeasance by the defendant. I accept that the applicant’s closer look at the records of the Company and Epicentre also made him believe that the recurring expense of operating the various clinics was very high and that cost-cutting measures might be called for. It was only after this that the applicant sought to wind down his joint venture with the defendant and went about incorporating New Path.

56     I find compelling Mr Tang’s point that in the letter of demand that the applicant had his solicitors issue on 22 May 2020 pains were taken to set out the applicant’s concerns in exhaustive detail so that the defendant might have ample opportunity to address them as he was invited in the letter to do. To my mind this strongly suggests that the applicant was genuinely desirous of learning what had happened to money belonging to the Company and J Five that was not accounted for. In terms of timing the letter of demand was sent about a week after the police informed the applicant that the defendant would not face criminal charges, and at the hearing Ms Ang submitted that this showed up the applicant’s true motives. I understand her submission to be that the applicant views civil proceedings as a means of obtaining what he could not achieve in the criminal sphere, and this suggests that his real aim is to oppress and punish the defendant. But I am unable to agree with this because I do not see anything untoward or improper about awaiting the outcome of police investigations before issuing a letter of demand in anticipation of potential civil proceedings, and I would go so far as to say that it strikes me as a sensible thing to do.

57     Hence the picture of the applicant that emerges for me is that of a participant in a joint venture who becomes cognisant of facts that cause him to harbour suspicions about the defendant, his co-participant in the venture. These are reasonable suspicions grounded on evidence. Unable to obtain immediate answers from the defendant – who to be fair to him is detained overseas against his will – the applicant decides that it is prudent to report his suspicions to the authorities. Meanwhile he sees that the business of the joint venture is losing money. He re-evaluates the wisdom of participating in the joint venture and determines that he should go his own way. But he still wants answers from the defendant, and so when the authorities decline to prosecute the matter he has his solicitors demand explanations. When explanations are offered but do not satisfy, he is reinforced in his belief that the defendant has done wrong. One of the entities of the joint venture to which the alleged wrong has been done is the Company. He would have the Company hold the defendant to account but on his own he lacks the ability to do so. Thus he makes this application.

58     Given this picture I have no doubt that the applicant honestly and reasonably believes that the Company has a good cause of action against the defendant. I am also satisfied that in making this application the applicant’s main purposes are to ascertain what happened to money of the Company that is unaccounted for and to make the defendant liable for any loss to the Company that can be shown to be the result of his wrongdoing. It is clear that these are proper and not collateral purposes.

59     I reject the defendant’s suggestion that the applicant “surreptitiously” carried out a “coup d’état”. I think the applicant honestly believed that he had to shut down the clinics of the parties’ joint venture to prevent further financial losses. I also think he genuinely felt that he could no longer work with the defendant in their joint venture given the reasonable suspicions of the defendant’s wrongdoing he had acquired. This was in no way a case of the applicant deciding beforehand to dissolve the joint venture for his personal benefit and then inventing reasons to do so by levelling baseless accusations at the defendant. I reject too the defendant’s suggestion that the applicant is “\[d\]eflecting blame from himself” that he ought to bear for the joint venture’s downfall. I might take a different view if the applicant’s allegations of the defendant’s wrongdoing against the Company were spurious and contrived, but as I have held they are legitimate and arguable.

60     Returning to the fact that the applicant was not forthright about the extent of his connections to New Path, given that his intention around May and June 2020 was apparently to have New Path take over the Jalan Malu Malu Clinic from the Company, I accept it is reasonable to infer that by obscuring the facts about New Path the applicant wished to avoid awkward questions about whether he was placing himself in a position where his duty to the Company might conflict with his interest in having New Path take over the Jalan Malu Malu Clinic. But the fact is that New Path has ended up having nothing to do with the Jalan Malu Malu Clinic. It is now operating a clinic located more than 5 km away. Any potential conflict has not materialised. That being so I cannot see how making this application could be calculated to aid the applicant’s venture with New Path at the expense of the Company. I express no view on the question of whether the applicant breached his duties to the Company simply by placing himself in a position of potential conflict – if the defendant truly believes that there was such a breach I think he is free to pursue that separately in any event. The material point is that I am not convinced that the applicant’s lack of candour reveals a collateral purpose behind this application.

61     It must perhaps be mentioned that the defendant has made an allegation of forgery against the applicant. The allegation is that in order to secure access to J Five’s DBS account the applicant forged the defendant’s signature on a form that he submitted to DBS. The defendant has gone as far as to make a police report dated 15 August 2020. The applicant strenuously denies that he committed any act of forgery. On the evidence available to me I see no way to make a firm finding in this dispute. Even if the allegation is made out, it relates to the affairs of J Five and I do not see how it connotes any collateral purpose on the applicant’s part in making this application. Thus I perceive here no reason to impugn the applicant’s good faith.

## Conclusion

62     I am satisfied that the applicant is acting in good faith and that it is _prima facie_ in the Company’s interests for it to bring an action to pursue the claims concerning alleged wrongdoing to the Company that I have found legitimate and arguable. Hence I grant leave to the applicant to bring an action in the name and on behalf of the Company against the defendant on the terms set out at \[4\] above. I am most grateful to counsel on both sides for their careful and diligent presentation of the large amount of factual and legal material in this application.
