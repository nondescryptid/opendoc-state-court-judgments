44     In summary, the Accused was first dealt with in 2003 for theft and was given 24 months’ probation. Probation was breached in 2004 where he was given another round of 24 months’ probation. The Accused was then sent to a juvenile home for 2 years for further theft offences in 2008. Thereafter he was sentenced in 2011 to reformative training for a minimum period of 18 months when he reoffended with an offence of cheating by forgery. He re-offended for a 4th time in 2014 where he was sentenced to a total of 18 months’ imprisonment comprising three consecutive sentences of 6 months’ imprisonment for theft-related offences.

45     He was back in court for a 6th time two years later, in 2016, where he was sentenced to a global sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment, comprising three consecutive sentences of 1 year’s imprisonment, again for property offences.

#### Prosecution’s submissions

46     The Prosecution sought for the Accused to be sentenced to 5 years’ of corrective training as well as for enhanced sentence for breach of the remission condition for a period that is close to the maximum allowed under the law to be imposed. The longest period would be under charge DAC 915812-2018, for which the remaining period is 280 days.

47     The Prosecution sought to justify their sentencing position on the ground that it complies with the _Sim Yeow Kee[^1]_ framework.

48     First, it was submitted that there was no disproportionate outcome in that if the Accused was sentenced to normal imprisonment, he would have been sentenced to at least 4.5 years’ imprisonment, given the escalation in his offending.

49     The global imprisonment term is based on a sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment for each theft offence and for 3 terms to run consecutively, taking into account his last sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment, comprising 3 consecutive sentences of one year’s imprisonment.

50     This would be on top of the enhanced sentence of 280 days pursuant to the breach of remission condition under section 50T of the Prisons Act.

51     The Prosecution justified their submission on uplift of imprisonment term from 12 months to 18 months on the following factors:

> i.     The Accused is a recalcitrant offender who has not reformed despite his past incarceration. The past records of his previous convictions in 2014 and 2016 were tendered to show that the Accused had reoffended using the same _modus operandi._

> ii.     The Accused’s criminal behaviour has escalated. The total value of items taken in respect of antecedents for 2014 and 2016 were $4,825.50 and $9,684.35 respectively. The amount for the present set of offences has increased to $12,832.90.

> iii.     Previous courts had taken into account the Accused’s pattern of offending in increasing the sentences of the Accused. The Accused began committing theft offences from 2003 when he was 11 years old and was place on 24 months’ probation. He reoffended on 3 occasions before turning 21, and was sentenced to another probation term in 2004, 2 years in a juvenile home in 2008 and reformative training in 2011. As an adult, his sentences were progressively lengthened from 18 months’ imprisonment in 2014 to 3 years’ imprisonment in 2016.

> iv.     Instead of reforming, the Accused has now gone on to commit a series of 14 theft offences. All the offences were committed whilst the Accused was subjected to a Conditional Remission Order and 11 offences were committed when he was on court bail from 9 January 2018 onwards.

52     The Prosecution secondly pointed out that the Accused is not liable to be placed under mandatory after care scheme (“MAS”) given that the offences he had committed, namely under section 380 of the Penal Code, although prescribed under the First Schedule of the Prisons Act, would require a drug-related antecedent, which the Accused does not possess. The Accused therefore would not be eligible for MAS even if he was sentenced to normal imprisonment terms.

53     Thus, the Prosecution argued that the dominant sentencing consideration would be that of prevention and specific deterrence.

54     In this regard, the Prosecution have also taken the position that the Accused did not suffer from any psychiatric illness such as any impulse control disorder to merit a more lenient or rehabilitative approach to sentence.

55     The Prosecution had relied on the evidence of Dr Stephen Phang, Senior Consultant Psychiatrist from the Institute of Mental Health for their position and urged the court to prefer his evidence over that given by Dr Julia Lam, a consultant forensic psychologist, the expert witness of the Defence. The evidence of both experts were given in a Newton hearing.

#### Mitigation

56     The Accused was represented by a lawyer, Mr Ravinderpal Singh of Kalco Law LLC, who had tendered a written mitigation on his behalf on 4 September 2018, seeking the minimum of 5 years’ corrective training. However, the Accused on the date fixed for mitigation and sentencing on 6 September 2018 discharged his lawyer and wanted to engage another lawyer.

57     Mr Dilip Kumar was subsequently engaged and the final mitigation on behalf of the Accused had changed. Mr Dilip argued for imprisonment of 1-2 years so that the Accused can be released as soon as possible to receive treatment.

58     The main thrust of Defence Counsel’s submission is that the Accused needs help to treat a host of problems. He submitted that the Accused had been diagnosed with low IQ as well as Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder. The Defence Counsel also made reference to Dr Julia Lam’s opinion that the Accused suffered from an Impulsive Control Disorder and Behavioural addiction.

59     Essentially, the Defence Counsel pointed out that the repeated incarcerations in the past had not helped the Accused and therefore a different approach was needed, which is treatment and rehabilitation.

#### Analysis of the expert opinions

60     I will start off with the Newton hearing to see what should be the dominant sentencing consideration in this case.

61     Dr Phang was very clear in his conclusion that the Accused did not suffer from any mental disorder or illness at the time of the examination and at or around the time of the offences. He noted that while the Accused had been previously diagnosed with ADHD and borderline intelligence, these were clearly not present at the material time.

62     During the examination, Dr Phang found the Accused to be “alert, lucid, and able to sit still throughout the interviews, without any fidgeting, agitation or restlessness, and was able to concentrate well. He answered questions appropriately and relevantly; there was no thought disorder or evidence of psychosis. His mood was not depressed, nor was he anxious. No cognitive deficits were noted; clinically he did not appear intellectually disabled.”[^2]

63     Dr Phang went on to state in his report that the Accused’s “obvious facility with language, communication and logical reasoning belie his past assessment of ‘borderline intelligence’.”

64     Finally, Dr Phang concluded that the Accused’s stealing behaviour did not have any aetiological basis in any psychiatric disorder. In other words, there is no causal link between any psychological disorder and the offences committed by the Accused.

65     I strongly agreed firstly with Dr Phang’s assessment of the Accused on the absence of any borderline intelligence or ADHD. His basis is sound and his conclusion also accorded with my observation of the Accused in court. The Accused was clearly able to follow the court proceedings and in particular there were 2 incidents in court which showed that the Accused was clearly cognitive and able to think rationally.

66     The first time this happened was on 15 March 2019, a date scheduled for the Newton hearing. The Accused was unable to secure the attendance of his expert witness, Dr Lam, as his father had apparently not been able to raise enough funds for her fees. The Accused applied for an adjournment and asked for him to be released on bail so that he can source for funding personally to obtain the services of Dr Lam. When his application was rejected, he informed the court that he was not able to carry on with the proceedings and that he would hurt himself. He then went into a crouching position and started crying. I stood down the case for the Accused to compose himself. I was told later that the Accused tried to hit his head against the barrier of the dock and had to be physically restrained. I could also hear him hollering from inside my chambers. The Defence Counsel subsequently applied for the Accused for a psychiatric examination stating that the Accused was feeling very stressed, unable to carry on with the proceedings and may hurt himself.

67     Given the Accused’s bizarre behaviour, I thought it prudent for a remand for psychiatric observation to be carried out and I so ordered. Dr Kenneth Koh’s report dated 29 March 2019 as a result of this remand was very pointed on the state of mind of the Accused. He found that the Accused was able to recount what had happened in court on that day. The Accused informed Dr Koh that he was feeling stressed due to the fact that he did not have Dr Lam in court whilst the prosecution had Dr Phang. He also informed Dr Koh that his lawyer had told him that it might be possible for CLAS (“Criminal Legal Aid Scheme”) to pay for Dr Lam’s services but that would mean he had to discharge his present lawyer and apply to CLAS to take on his case but CLAS had previously rejected his application. He then explained that as the Court had disallowed his application to be bailed out so that he could source for funds for Dr Lam’s attendance in court, he had resorted to self-harm and verbalised that it would be better to kill himself if the Court would not adjourn the case.

68     Dr Koh found that the Accused spoke relevantly and had no psychotic features. He was also able to discuss his legal options with Dr Koh. Accordingly, Dr Koh found that while he was distressed and disappointed by the seeming unfairness of the proceedings, his behaviour on 15 March 2019 was not attributable to any mental disorder and was currently fit to plead.

69     The Accused quite clearly had demonstrated a reasonably high level of thinking and engaged in goal-directed behaviour when he chose to deliberately disrupt the court proceedings in order to secure an adjournment.

70     The second incident was on 17 September 2019, a date scheduled for submission on sentencing. The Accused claimed he was not well and was unresponsive when the Court indicated that no adjournment would be granted as there was no supporting medical document from Prisons to say that he was unfit to attend court. In the course of submission on sentencing, I raised the issue on whether there was a need to call for a fresh report on suitability for corrective training as the last report was prepared more than a year ago on 4 September 2018. The Defence Counsel initially agreed with prosecution that there was no need to call for another report. However, on hearing that, the Accused who was sitting with his head lowered, suddenly sat up and asked to speak with his counsel. The Defence Counsel then changed his position and said that his client wanted a fresh Corrective Training Report as circumstances might have changed in the past one year.

71     This incident again demonstrated that the Accused was feigning illness in order to delay proceedings when in fact he was clearly able to proceed and could follow court proceedings with clear understanding.

72     The Accused hence clearly did not come across as a person with borderline intelligence or was in any way, intellectually disabled. Instead, he had demonstrated manipulative behaviour to achieve his own ends.

73     As for Dr Phang’s conclusion that there was no causal link between his offending behaviour and any mental or psychiatric disorder, I am in full agreement with his findings.

74     First, as highlighted by Prosecution, both experts are in agreement that the Accused did not suffer from kleptomania or any psychiatric condition listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (“DSM-5”) or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (“ICD-10”).

75     Dr Phang confirmed that the Accused did not fulfil all the diagnostic criteria of kleptomania. Whilst Dr Lam agreed with this finding, nonetheless, she had opined that “the nature of his theft behaviour would qualify for an Impulse Control Disorder”.

76     I found that Dr Phang had convincingly debunked such a possibility. Dr Phang had stated categorically the “official, formal, operationalised diagnostic criteria (such as the DSM-5) exist to guide and inform the proper and correct practice of clinical psychiatry” and that “while psychiatry is unquestionably not an exact science, neither is it an undefinable art, and the offical operationalised diagnostic citeria should therefore rightly be read, understood, interpreted and applied as punctilliously as possible.” Hence he was of the view that it is “trite to state that an individual who does not fulfil all the requisite diagnostic criteria for a given psychiatric disorder should not be diagnosed to be suffering from that disorder at all.”[^3]

77     Dr Phang then went on to give cogent and sound reasoning as to why the the Accused did not meet the diagnostic criteria for kleptomania. The extract from DSM-5 containing the diagnostic criteria for kleptomania had been tendered as exhibit P-1 and set out here as follows:

> A.     Recurrent failure to resist impulses to steal objects that are not needed for personal use or for their monetary value.

> B.     Increasing sense of tension immediately before committing the theft.

> C.     Pleasure, gratification, or relief at the time of committing the theft.

> D.     The stealing is not committed to express anger or vengeance and is not in response to a delusion or a hallucination.

> E.     The stealing is not better explained by conduct disorder, a manic episode, or antisocial personality disorder.

78     Dr Phang found that the Accused did not exhibit uncontrollable stealing for symptomatic relief of unbearable tension and anxiety. Based on the Accused’s account to Dr Phang, he had taken the items because he thought the items were ‘nice’ and had stolen them after giving into the temptation. The Accused had also described as having experienced “the same urge to steal” when he beheld the electronic paraphernalia. Dr Phang found that there was no convincing evidence of impulsivity in the clinical sense. Instead, the Accused had demonstrated “deliberateness in his actions while committing theft, which belied the very definition of an impulse-control disorder”.[^4] In fact, according to Dr Phang, the Accused had categorically denied that he had experienced any sense of mounting tension, unbearable, overwhelming anxiety, palpitations or uncontrollable urge to steal at or around the material times..”[^5].

79     Dr Phang’s view was based not just on the account given by the Accused in describing how he had loitered around and stole after he had turned off the “power plug alarm system” but was further confirmed by the CCTV footage played in court of this offence in court. The Accused could be seen moving in and out of the shelf area of the shop a few times before turning off the alarm system that was plugged to the handphone and returning to the same item a while later to remove the item. Dr Phang’s view that there was no psychiatric disorder was further reinforced when he saw the Accused after his re-arrest where the Accused informed him that whilst he was in remand that he had stolen steroid cream because he had eczema and nasal spray as he had “rhinitis”, items for which he had perceived to be potentially useful[^6].

80     Dr Lam conceded very significantly, in my view, that the Accused did not fulfil criteria B (as set out in \[77\] above), which is that of rising tension before committing the offence. I set out the relevant excerpt of her answers given in response during cross-examination as well as to questions from the Court[^7]:

>   
| 

“Q

 | 

Sorry, so, your answer would be?

 |
| 

A

 | 

So, he fulfil A, C and D.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, he does not fulfil B and E?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yah, for B he has (clears throat) he---f---he didn’t have that tension immediately before but he have the tension after the theft which was also mentioned in Prof. Grant’s book.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

He did not have the tension before the theft but he did have the tension---

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

The tension and the anxiety---

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

after the theft?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

after the theft. And that---

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

But---

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

gives---

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

the criteria is for before.

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Yah. That’s why I say he didn’t fulfil it. So, in the DSM-5 it’s pure kleptomania.

 |
| 

Court

 | 

So---so, now---s---he does not fulfil criteria B. He---not that it’s partial.

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

He---he does not---he doesn’t. So, he fulfil A, C and D.”

 |

  
  

81     I therefore found quite clearly that the Accused did not suffer from kleptomania. However, that is not the end of the matter as Dr Lam whilst conceding that the Accused was not suffering from kleptomania as defined in DSM-5, nonetheless went on to say that he was still suffering from a kind of impulsive disorder.

82     She had used various phrases in her evidence in court: atypical kleptomania[^8], behavioural addiction, impulse control issue or disorder[^9] and atypical theft offending[^10]. Dr Lam, with due respect, was waffling whenever she was pinned down by prosecution as to the exact disorder that she had diagnosed the Accused with. She initially said what he had could be conceptualised as atypical kleptomania. However, when pressed that this term does not appear in any of the clinical text, she then said it would be better not to use this phrase given the controversy it has generated and switched to the phrase of impulse control disorder. However, when she was again pressed by prosecution that DSM-5 no longer has such a classification of impulse control-disorder, not otherwise specified, she conceded that this classification was present in the earlier edition, DSM-4 but went on to say that some clinicians have stated that DSM-5 classification is overly restrictive.

83     Overall, I was not able to place much confidence in Dr Lam’s opinion. She was imprecise and vacillated in her evidence with regard to what kind of disorder the Accused was suffering from. She placed reliance on a book by Dr Grant meant for laypersons’ reading. She had difficulty stating the basis of her conclusion that the Accused was suffering from an impulse control disorder as there was no support for her diagnosis from established forensic psychiatric literature. She had to resort to generalisations and rather amateurish assumptions such as that there must be something wrong with the Accused as there was no rational reason why the Accused would go and repeatedly reoffend with all its penal consequences despite him having a loving family to support him.

84     I also found it shocking that Dr Lam had solely relied on the literature of Dr Grant in recommending that the Accused be tried on a drug of Naltrexone simply because the Accused had not been tried this medication. As a psychologist and not a psychiatrist, she has no business to be recommending that the Accused be placed on any medication which she is not trained or qualified to prescribe. Further, this medication is known to have possible serious side effects ranging from nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, dizziness, dysphoria and anxiety to life threatening ones such as liver toxicity[^11], eonsiphilic pneumonia and hepatocellular injury[^12].

85     She also came across as not being impartial when she was confronted with CCTV footage depicting the deliberateness of the Accused’s actions in dismantling the alarm on the phone after entering and leaving the shop with the phone before returning and repeating his action of dismantling the alarm of another phone and stealing it. When she was asked if this action on the part of the Accused was very deliberate, instead of answering the question, she appeared rather defensive of the Accused, stating that

> “I would be curious to know why it is like half an hour. And after he took the 1st phone, it is very risky for him to have the stolen good in his bag and he went back again. To me, it doesn’t make sense. It’s just too risky.”[^13]

86     Another instance of her lack of impartiality was in her response upon being shown the Accused’s statement on his motivation for stealing the Iphone 6 plus handphone. Dr Lam had earlier implied that the Accused was not being selective in choosing to steal that handphone as “anyone his age will know that phone will be useless because any phone beyond iPhone 5 actually you need password or you need fingerprint to unlock and also it’s not a new phone.”[^14] Thus, it would be nonsensical for the Accused to want to steal this phone out of greed as he would know he would not be able to make use of it. Hence she had accepted his account set out in \[22\] of her report that the Accused had “felt guilty and instead of going home, he changed MRT lines a few times from Sengkang to Outram, then City Hall to Tampines to discard the items he stole. He was bothered by his conscience that he stole again”. However, in the Accused’s police statement (admitted and marked P3), he had stated that after taking the Iphone, he had gone home immediately and whilst trying to turn on the phone at home, he realised it was locked. As it was then useless to him, he discarded it. This presented a very different picture of his motivation to steal the handphone.

87     However, instead of reviewing her earlier position, she immediately latched on the second part of the Accused’s statement where he had stated that he did not have any use for it as he already had his own iphone. Her readiness to accept his answer indiscriminately shows that she has lost objectivity in her assessment. Just because the Accused owns an iphone clearly does not negate the possibility that he would want to own another iphone out of greed. Furthermore, the statement makes it clear that the Accused decided to discard the iphone only because he could not make use of it and not because of any guilty conscience. However, Dr Lam had conveniently avoided the fact that the Accused had been less than honest with her and continued to maintain her position that the Accused had not taken the iphone due to a stealing addiction[^15].

88     In the final analysis, Dr Phang was very cogent and comprehensive in his explanations as to why the Accused did not qualify to be diagnosed as suffering from any impulsive control disorder by referring to the interviews with the Accused as well as to the deliberateness of his offending behaviour based on the statement of facts and the CCTV footage. He also relied on official and established diagnostic criteria set out in DSM-5. In contrast, Dr Lam, while acknowledging that the Accused did not fulfil all the diagnostic criteria of kleptomania, had great difficulty articulating and supporting her conclusion that the Accused nonetheless suffered from an impulse-control disorder.

89     I therefore had no hesitation in preferring Dr Phang’s evidence over Dr Lam’s and found that the Accused was not suffering from any psychiatric or mental disorder that has a contributing link to his thieving behaviour.

#### Sentencing Principle

90     In the absence of such a link, the predominant sentencing principle in the present case would clearly be one of specific deterrence given that the Accused is a recalcitrant offender. The sentencing objective would also involve prevention as the Accused was totally unremorseful and showed no change in his attitude towards committing further thieving offences, even when he was in remand.

91     The Accused fulfils the technical requirements for a sentence of corrective training pursuant to section 304 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Code.

92     The sentencing objective of corrective training as set out in section 304 fits the Accused squarely, which is that it is “expedient with a view to his reformation and the prevention of crime”.

93     I agree with the submissions of prosecution that applying the sentencing approach in _Sim Yeow Kee_, there is nothing to militate against the imposition of a corrective training.

94     Firstly, I found that the length of regular imprisonment would be in the region of four years’ imprisonment. The Accused had escalated in his offending in terms of the value of the stolen items, from $4,825.50, in 2014 to $9,684.35 in 2016 and finally to a very sizable amount of $12,832.90 for the current set of offences. He also targeted expensive items such as handphones costing over a thousand dollars as well as other expensive electronic devices and gadgets. The Accused shows no sign of abatement despite this being his 7th appearance in court in 16 years.

95     He continued to re-offend without any fear of any consequences even after his arrest and being charged in court. It is noted in fact that he had also continued to reoffend after he had been seen by Dr Phang in December 2017 and Dr Lam in January 2018. What is even more aggravating is that, even after the initial bail was revoked and bail was doubled to $20,000 on 19 February 2018 due to fresh offences being committed whilst on the first bail, the Accused went on to commit further offences, resulting finally in bail being completely revoked on 22 March 2018, thereby bringing a cessation to his theft behaviour outside of prison. He had clearly shown he was unwilling to change or exercise any self-control.

96     His last sentence was a total of 3 years’ imprisonment with individual sentences of 1 years’ imprisonment. Given the increase in the value of the stolen items, I would have increased the individual sentences to 16 months’ imprisonment and ordered 3 to run consecutively, totalling 48 months’ imprisonment. In addition, the Accused is liable for a maximum period of 280 days as enhanced sentence for breach of basic condition of his remission order. As the nature of the offences for his last sentence is similar, I would have imposed at around 80% of the maximum period ie 224 days giving a total of 4 years and 224 days of imprisonment.

97     This would clearly be very close to the minimum mandatory period of corrective training of 5 years. Therefore, the minimum sentence of corrective training would not be unduly disproportionate to any regular imprisonment which would have been imposed.

98     It is also accepted that the Accused does not qualify for the mandatory aftercare scheme as the Accused does not have a prescribed drug-related antecedent. Therefore, an imposition of corrective training would not deprive him the benefit of any mandatory aftercare scheme since he would not have been eligible to receive such benefit in the first place.

99     Accordingly, I found it appropriate to send a deterrent message to the Accused about the consequences of his persistent and habitual offending that it has reached a stage where the preventive objective of punishment has taken on a more central role. It is hoped that the quantitative difference of corrective training where there is no expected right of early release on licence will help to instil in the Accused a greater awareness of the need to control his offending behaviour.

100    However, I am not willing to add on to the minimum period of corrective training of 5 years with any additional enhanced sentencing pursuant to section 50T of the Prisons Act for the breach of basic condition of remission order. This is because, the minimum period would already be longer than the global sentence of a regular imprisonment and enhanced sentence ie 4 years and 224 days (as set out at \[96\] above).

#### Conclusion

101    The relatively young age of the Accused who is currently 27 years old, belies the fact that he had been in and out of rehabilitative institutions as well as prison on no less than 7 occasions and had spent almost 8 years in detention over the last 11 years. The Accused, unfortunately, despite undergoing past rehabilitative programmes through probation, juvenile homes and reformative training regime, continues to succumb to temptation to steal habitually.

102    I found his words in his police statement P3, very telling:

> “I have no idea why I took the phone. I did not take it for my own use because I already have my own Iphone and I did not intend to sell it because I understand that stolen phone is easier to trace me**_. I think this habit of stealing has something to do with my mental state. I used to be a patient in IMH for ADHD and OCD._** I am willing to seek treatment at IMH for this bad habit. I am remorseful for what I had done and I would not want this to happen again.”

103    The Accused appears to be hiding behind a self-diagnosed handicap resulting in him continuing with and justifying his thieving behaviour. He clearly showed no inclination to seek treatment and stopped his behaviour as demonstrated by the fact that the above statement was made by the Accused on 24 December 2017, after which he had gone on bail and reoffended 11 more times (see schedule of offences). In the words of Dr Phang, the Accused “did not evince any sense of remorse for his repetitive acquisitive offending and appeared instead to have a sense of entitlement”[^16].

104    It is hoped that this stint of corrective training of 5 years will go some way to change the attitude of the Accused and equip him sufficiently with the necessary skill and resolve to live a meaningful and law-abiding life on his release.
