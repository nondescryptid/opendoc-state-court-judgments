## BACKGROUND

2       The Accused claimed trial to the six charges set out above in \[1\]. He was unrepresented. At the end of a 3-day trial, I found him guilty on all six charges and I convicted him accordingly. The prosecution then made him an offer in relation to the remaining stood down charges. I gave him an adjournment to consider the matter. At the next mention, he had engaged Mr Subir Singh. Mr Singh informed me that the Accused would accept the prosecution’s offer and plead guilty. But he needed some time to prepare his client’s case. Again, I adjourned the matter.

3       At the next mention, the Accused pleaded guilty to a further six charges and consented to have eight charges taken into consideration (see \[1\]). I took the plea and after hearing submissions, I sentenced the Accused as set out below –

4       I ordered the sentences of imprisonment in DAC 933099/16, DAC 933104/16, DAC 948561/16, MAC 905760/18 and MAC 905765/18 to run consecutively. The total aggregate sentence was thirteen months’ and two weeks’ imprisonment with effect from 24 Feb 20, and fine $3,800 in default nineteen days’ imprisonment. The Accused was also disqualified from obtaining or holding all classes of driving licence for 10 years with effect from the date of his release from prison.

5       The Accused has appealed against sentence only.

## THE TRIAL CHARGES

6       As the appeal was only against sentence, I would only set out the salient findings of fact that I arrived at in convicting the Accused on all the six charges proceeded at trial. I would not delve in minute details the evidence adduced and how I treated them.

7       On 18 Aug 16, two officers from the Traffic Police (“TP”) in an unmarked police car conducted a lookout at Chuan Hoe Avenue. At about 2.15 pm, they saw the Accused boarding motorcar bearing registration numbers SJV 7197K (“the Car”), which was parked along Chuan Hoe Avenue. He started the engine and drove away. The two TP officers followed behind.

8       After driving a short distance along Parry Avenue, the police car drove past the Car. The police car then stopped in a 45º angle in front of the Car. In this position, it effectively blocked the road. The intention was to intercept the Car. One TP officer alighted from the police car and approached the Car on foot. He identified himself as a police officer to the Accused by showing his badge. The Accused reversed the Car at a high speed. The other TP officer gave chase in the police car. Finally, it caught up with the Car and attempted to box the Car in. Instead of giving himself up, the Accused deliberately rammed the Car into the police car, causing extensive damage to both vehicles. After the collision, the Accused abandoned the Car and fled on foot. The Accused was at this time under a disqualification order. At the material time, the road tax for the car was also not paid. The area where the incident took place was a residential estate.

9       The Accused had committed the following six offences –

> (a)     Driving in a rash manner so as to endanger human life - s 279 PC;

> (b)     Driving whilst under a disqualification order - s 43(4) RTA;

> (c)     Driving without a valid insurance policy - s 3(1) MV(TPRC)A;

> (d)     Unpaid road tax in relation to the car - s 29 RTA;

> (e)     Failing to stop after a traffic accident - s 84(1) RTA; and

> (f)     Failing to make a police report within 24 hours of a traffic accident – s 84(2) RTA.

## THE PLEAD GUILTY CHARGES

10     The facts of these charges were set out below -

## Facts relating to DAC 929555/16 & DAC 929556/16

11     The Accused was the registered owner of motorcar bearing registration numbers SJV 7197K. On 7 Feb 14 at about 105 am, SJV 7197K was captured by the traffic red light surveillance camera for failing to conform to the red light signal along Adam Road by Sime Road towards Lornie Road. A notice to furnish driver’s particulars dated 2 Feb 15 was issued to the Accused. He did not furnish the said particulars within the requisite 14 days.

12     On 16 Jan 14, at about 5.02 pm, the Accused’s car SJV 7197K was clocked to have travelled at a speed of 86 km per hour by a police speed camera at Tampines Avenue 1 towards Tampines Avenue 10. The speed limit on that road was 60 km per hour. A notice to furnish driver’s particulars dated 19 Jan 15 was issued to the Accused. He did not furnish the said particulars within the requisite 14 days.

## Facts relating to DAC 933099/16

13     On 19 Apr 16, while driving a van bearing registration numbers GZ 1794R, the Accused collided into a car, causing damage to the car amounting to $1,200. No compensation was made by the Accused to the owner of the car.

14     At the material time, the Accused was serving a disqualification order for three years from 8 Jul 14 to 7 Jul 17. He had also been convicted and sentenced on one count of driving whilst under disqualification on 8 Jul 14 and on one count of speeding on 27 Nov 13. As such, he was liable for the enhanced punishment under s 67A(1) RTA.

## Facts relating to DAC 948559/16

15     On 28 Jul 15, at about 3.00 pm, while driving van GQ 588Z, the Accused had failed to keep a proper lookout and caused it to collide into a parked BMW. The BMW’s right bumper was dented, and there was damage to the front right rim and tyre. The body paint had also peeled off. The Accused only became aware of the collision when he was alerted to it by someone who had witnessed the accident. The Accused only made compensation of $300 for the dent and the body paint. He did not make any compensation for the damaged tyre and rim.

16     At the material time, he was under a disqualification order for three years from 8 Jul 14 to 7 Jul 17. He had also been convicted and sentenced on one count of driving whilst under disqualification on 8 Jul 14, and on one count of speeding on 27 Nov 13. As such, he was liable for the enhanced punishment under s 67A(1) RTA.

## Facts relating to MAC 905760/18

17     The Accused had rented a unit at 7030 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5 #06-15 Northstar@AMK from one Goh Wee Kuan (“Goh”). The tenancy commenced on 1 Apr 17. The tenancy was terminated because the cheque for the first month’s rent bounced. The Accused was told to move out. But he delayed and only started moving out on 8 Apr 17. Goh changed the lock but despite this, the Accused had been seen inside the unit on two occasions. Finally, the Accused cleared all his belongings from the unit on 2 Jun 17 under Goh’s supervision.

18     On 11 Jul 17, at about 10 pm, the Accused returned to the unit with a few hired men. He dishonestly misappropriated some items belonging to Goh that had been placed outside the unit. These were –

> (a)     Some scaffoldings valued at $500;

> (b)     Some metal and nettings valued at $400;

> (c)     One toolbox valued at $200;

> (d)     One hacker valued at $300; and

> (e)     One air-conditioner compressor valued at $1,500.

19     The total value of these items was $2,900. These items were recovered from the Accused’s house at 5 Chuan Hoe Avenue.

## Facts relating to MAC 905765/18

20     The Accused was an ex-tenant of 854 Dunearn Road. He had moved out of the house in early 2017. The owner of the house was one Lester Yong (“Lester”). Lester had told him that he could return to the house to pick up any remaining belongings but only under Lester’s supervision. In the meantime, Lester had let the house to one Kim Won (“Kim”) sometime in January 2017.

21     On 26 May 17, sometime in the afternoon, Kim had left the house to run some errands. The main gate was secured. Kim’s friend was in the house at this time. When Kim returned to the house at about 4.30 pm, she was informed by her friend that there was a Caucasian woman in the house. Kim recognised her as the Accused’s girlfriend. The Caucasian woman told her that she was there to collect her belongings. Kim called Lester to inform him about this. Whilst she was on the phone, she saw the Accused coming down from the second floor of the house. He did not leave the house. Instead he walked around the house. He claimed that he was there to collect his belongings. Feeling unsafe, Kim waited outside the house until the police arrived.

25     In relation to the s 279 PC offence, she highlighted that the Accused had deliberately rammed his car into the police car in his effort to escape arrest. Although she conceded the harm caused here was relatively low, but the culpability was very high. She relied on the cases of _PP v Liew Kang Jun_ (MAC 909555/17) and _PP v Rozman bin Abdullah_ (DAC 916452/17) where sentences of two months’ imprisonment and three months’ imprisonment were imposed.

26     In relation to the three s 43(4) RTA offences, she highlighted the fact that the Accused had on 8 Jul 14, been sentenced to four weeks’ imprisonment and three years disqualification for a similar s 43(4) RTA offence. In addition, there were also four TIC charges connected to the act of driving whilst under disqualification. The case precedents tendered by her also showed that sentences ranging from three to five months’ imprisonment have been imposed – see _PP v Peck Siong Hoon (Bai Xiangyun)_ (DAC 927085/17 & Ors) and _PP v Balachandran s/o Bernard_ (DAC 914092/19 & Ors). For these reasons, she asked for sentences of four months’ imprisonment and 10 years’ disqualification except for DAC 948561/16. For this charge, she argued that an uplift was warranted because the Accused had committed this s 43(4) offence when he was under investigation for a similar offence committed less than two months prior (DAC 948555/16). As such, in relation to DAC 948561/16, she asked for six months’ imprisonment and 10 years’ disqualification.

27     In total, DPP Chu sought a total aggregate sentence of 14 months’ and 2 weeks’ imprisonment, fine $5,000 and 10 years’ disqualification. This was based on having four charges running consecutively, that is, two s 43(4) RTA, one s 279 PC and one s 448 PC charges.

## MITIGATION PLEA

28     Mr Singh tendered a written mitigation plea. He sought for a global sentence of around nine months’ and three weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $1,200, with the appropriate disqualification period.

29     On the s 279 PC charge, Mr Singh highlighted the facts that distinguished his client’s case from the precedent cases. These were –

> (a)     The incident had occurred along a small street, which was a primarily residential area. The traffic flow was light.

> (b)     Other than the damage suffered by the police car, no one suffered any injury. Following from (a), the location of the incident also meant that the likelihood of harm caused to others was significantly lower. Therefore, the potential for harm was low.

30     Therefore, Mr Singh submitted that the Accused’s culpability fell within the medium category while harm was low. Applying the culpability-harm matrix set out in _PP v Muhammad Yusree bin Mohamed Yatim_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 186</span>, the appropriate sentence should be a term of two months’ imprisonment and an appropriate period of disqualification.

31     On the three s 43(4) RTA charges, Mr Singh acknowledged that because the Accused has a previous conviction, there should be an uplift in the imprisonment sentences. He submitted for a sentence of not more than three months’ imprisonment for each charge, followed by an appropriate period of disqualification.

32     For the s 3(1) insurance charge, Mr Singh submitted that as his client had been sentenced to the maximum fine of $1000 previously, three weeks’ imprisonment was appropriate for the charge.

33     For the s 29(1) RTA charge, Mr Singh submitted for a fine of $600. He cited two cases namely, _PP v Liew Yee Long_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGMC 37</span> and _PP v Ng Boon Tuan_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 21</span>, in support.

34     For the s 84(1) and s 84(2) RTA charges, Mr Singh submitted that fines of $300 per charge were appropriate. He cited _PP v Mohamad Yusri bin Mohamed Yusoff_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 134</span> to support his submission.

35     For the two charges under s 81(1) RTA, the usual tariff was a fine of $400 as could be seen from _PP v Muhammad Taufiq bin Alia Marikan_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 158</span> and _PP v Mohammad Faizal bin Omar_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 84</span>).

36     For the s 403 PC charge, Mr Singh sought a sentence of one week’s imprisonment. He cited the case of _PP v Koh Sock Buay_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 38</span> in support. In that case, a sum of $26,822 was misappropriated and the sentence imposed was six weeks’ imprisonment. The present case only involved $2,900, and all the items were recovered. The Accused also did not have any theft related antecedent.

37     For the s 448 PC charge, Mr Singh submitted for a sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment, as there was no forced entry into the house and there was no evidence of theft.

## THE SENTENCE

38     For the s 279 PC charge, I agreed with the DPP’s submissions that although the level of harm was low, culpability was high. The Accused had deliberately rammed his car into the police car in his desperate bid to escape lawful arrest. The damage caused to both vehicles was significant. They included metal parts being twisted out of shape and substantially cracked. The damage showed that the impact was of significant force. He had also driven the Car in a very dangerous manner. He driven “_fairly fast, even though it was reversing_”, so much so “_it was quite an effort for me to keep up with that vehicle even_”[^1]. He had “_reverse fast and aggressive_” and continued reversing at “_a fast speed, approximately 50 kilometres per hour or more_”[^2]. His egregious manner of driving had caused the Car to make screeching sounds on two instances – once when he executed a u-turn and once when he executed a turn. The bad driving was exacerbated by the fact that it was in a residential neighbourhood, and there were pedestrians on the side of the road. There were also vehicles parked along the road (see the evidence of PW1 and the photographs Exhibits P3/1 and P3/2).

39     Under these circumstances, applying the culpability-harm matrix in _Muhammad Yusree[^3]_, the sentence for a serious culpability-low harm case was at least four months’ imprisonment. I was of the view that four months’ imprisonment was appropriate in this case.

40     For the three s 43(4) RTA charges, the case precedents tendered by the prosecution showed that the sentences ranged from three to five months’ imprisonment. DPP Chu asked for six months’ imprisonment and 10 years’ disqualification for DAC 948561/16 (to which he had claimed trial), and four months’ imprisonment and the same period of disqualification for the two other charges to which he had pleaded guilty. I agreed entirely with the DPP’s submissions. Quite apart from the fact that he had claimed trial to the charge, and therefore he was not entitled to a sentencing discount, I have to consider the egregious nature of the offence (see \[38\] above). I could not ignore tThe brazen manner in which the offence was committed. He had committed the offence when he was under investigation for a similar offence committed about two months before. He had no scruples in taking all means necessary to effect his escape from arrest, including ramming the police car without any regard to the danger caused to the police officers.

41     For the other RTA charges, I agreed that high quantum of fines were appropriate on account of the context in which they were committed. High fines were necessary to reflect the serious nature of the offences. For the s 84(1) and s 84(2) RTA offences to which he had claimed trial, I imposed fines of $1,000 in default five days’ imprisonment each. For the s 29, I imposed a fine of $600 in default three days’ imprisonment as this involved a failure to pay road tax, which was an administrative offence. For the two s 81(1)(A) RTA offences, I imposed fines of $600 in default three days’ imprisonment each.

42     For the s 3(1) insurance charge, as he had similar previous convictions, I sentenced him to one week’s imprisonment and disqualification from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of five years with effect from 12 Sep 19.

43     For the s 403 and s 448 PC charges, both the DPP and DC agreed that imprisonment sentences should follow, but they differed slightly in the quantum. I was of the view that one week’s imprisonment for each charge was appropriate.

44     My order on consecutive sentences and the total aggregate sentence were set out at \[3\] and \[4\]. I was of the opinion that the total aggregate sentence properly reflected the gravity of the offences committed.

45     The Accused has appealed against the sentence. He has paid the fines in full. He is on bail pending the outcome of the appeal.
