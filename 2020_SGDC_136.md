\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9081/2020/01.\]

10 June 2020

### District Judge Christopher Tan Pheng Wee:

1       The Accused is a 29-year-old female Malaysian national. She pleaded guilty to one charge under s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”) read with s 11(1) of the Remote Gambling Act (No 34 of 2014) (“RGA”) for abetting, by intentionally aiding in, the provision of Singapore-based remote gambling services.

2       Three other charges were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing:

> (a)     one charge under s 5(1) of the Organised Crime Act 2015 (No 26 of 2015) (“OCA”) for being a member of what the Accused knew to be a locally-linked organised criminal group;

> (b)     one charge under s 12(1)(b) of the OCA for engaging in conduct which the Accused knew would facilitate commission of an offence under s 11(1) of the RGA, in furtherance of the illegal purpose of an organised criminal group; and

> (c)     one charge under s 5(a) of the Common Gaming Houses Act (Cap 49, 1985 Rev Ed) (“CGHA”) for assisting in the carrying on of public lotteries.

3       I sentenced the Accused to 12 months’ imprisonment for the charge that was proceeded with, _ie_, under s 11(1) of the RGA. She has appealed against the sentence and is currently on bail.

## Facts

4       The salient facts of this case are set out below. They have been gleaned from the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) to which the Accused admitted without qualification, undisputed documents tendered by the parties and concessions made by them during the hearing before me. The facts below detail the involvement of not only the Accused but that of a co-accused, Lai Yen San Sunny (“Sunny Lai”), who was recently sentenced by the High Court to 18 months’ imprisonment for charges similar to that brought against the Accused.

### Structure of the syndicate

5       The Accused was an administrative staff of an organised criminal group behind a remote gambling syndicate (“the syndicate”). The syndicate was structured as follows:[^1]

> (a)     The syndicate was headed by three brothers: Eric Seet, Steven Seet and Philip Seet (“the Seet brothers”). They operated, _inter alia_, two remote gambling four-digit (“4D”) websites: www.asure6.net (“asure6”) and www.888pool.net (“888pool”).

> (b)     The syndicate had a chief runner who, on instructions from the Seet brothers, collected and distributed monies related to the illegal remote gambling operations.

> (c)     The syndicate also had three administrative staff: the Accused, Sunny Lai and one other person.

> (d)     The syndicate had three main clusters, each comprising agents who actively collected bets and shareholders who shared in the profits and losses flowing from the asure6 and 888pool websites.

6       The operation of the asure6 and 888pool websites were centrally managed and controlled from Singapore. Illegal 4D bets from agents and punters were keyed into these websites, which were then used to conduct public lotteries via remote communications.[^2] One of the purposes of the syndicate was thus the obtaining of financial benefit from committing offences under sections 9 and 11(1) of the RGA.[^3]

### The Accused’s involvement with the syndicate

7       Sometime in 2009, the Accused came to Singapore to work as a secretary in a massage parlour. While at this job, she got acquainted with Steven Seet (who was one of the bosses at the massage parlour) and Sunny Lai (who worked as a receptionist there). Shortly after, the Accused returned to Malaysia. In early 2012, Steven Seet called the Accused and offered her a job as an account assistant with an entity called Erictex Trading (“Erictex”). Initially, Steven Seet told her that Erictex was an IT company supporting licensed gambling in the Philippines. The Accused accepted the job.

8       In February 2012, the Accused reported for work at Erictex’s premises at Ubi Road, where she was housed with some Information Technology (“IT”) programming workers. These workers assisted in troubleshooting both the asure6 and 888pool websites, as well as another bookkeeping website called www.ES123.net (“ES123”). The Accused saw that the office had many computers as well as two wall-mounted televisions screening live horse races. The Accused came to learn that Erictex was dealing with illegal 4D and horse betting activities. Specifically, she knew that:[^4]

> (a)     asure6 and 888pool were illegal 4D betting websites operated by Eric and Steven Seet; and

> (b)     ES123 was a bookkeeping website maintained by the syndicate to track the syndicate’s cash flow and expenses and monitor cash flow for illegal 4D bets.

9       Erictex was, in effect, a shell company set up by Eric and Steven Seet. Both brothers also set up two other shell companies: SB IT Developer (“SB IT”) and Best Laser Music House (“Best Laser”). The three shell companies, which shared office units at the Ubi Road office without any real shop fronts, had no real business.[^5] Having been set up for the purpose of carrying out illegal betting activities through the asure6 and 888pool websites, the three shell companies were crucial to the operation of both websites and the Accused knew this.[^6]

10     The Accused worked for the syndicate from February 2012 to the end of November 2016. Her job at the syndicate centred on human resource (“HR”) and administrative matters. Under the instructions of Eric and Steven Seet, she managed the HR and administration of the three shell companies, without any clear delineation of the work as between each company.[^7] By tending to the shell companies, the Accused’s administrative role was crucial to the illegal remote gambling services operated by Eric and Steven Seet.[^8]

11     The Accused’s duties included managing the payroll of workers, paying out salaries, managing Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) contributions, applying for permits, filing tax returns, handling petty cash claims and issuing cheques for rental and utilities.[^9] Further details of her tasks are set out below:

> (a)     The Accused would prepare the payroll for all employees of Erictex and SB IT, getting Steven Seet’s approval for the list of employees and the amounts payable to them. Eric or Steven Seet would access the token, allowing the Accused to log in to Erictex’s bank account and pay employee salaries through internet banking.

> (b)     She assisted in managing GIRO deductions in respect of workers’ CPF contributions and foreign worker levies.

> (c)     She also assisted with applications to the Ministry of Manpower for work permits.

> (d)     On the instructions of Eric Seet, the Accused filled up Erictex’s income tax declaration to IRAS for the years 2013 and 2014, using the figures that he dictated to her.

> (e)     The Accused also managed payments of petty cash to workers for meals or stationery.

12     As regards the cheques issued by the Accused, these are listed below:

> (a)     On Steven Seet’s instructions, the Accused issued a cheque for more than $100,000 for the purchase of 50 servers to be used for illegal 4D and horse betting activities, as well as another cheque for more than $10,000 for purchasing computers.

> (b)     On Steven Seet’s instructions, the Accused issued a cheque for about $30,000 to $40,000 for the renovation of the Ubi office.

> (c)     On the instructions of Eric and Steven Seet, the Accused issued cheques from Erictex’s bank account for rental of the Ubi Road office units, as well as for renting a condominium unit in Yio Chu Kang used for illegal horse betting activities. Specifically, she issued 13 cheques amounting to $30,402, between 7 April 2015 and 1 April 2016.

> (d)     On the instructions of Eric and Steven Seet, the Accused issued cheques for internet usage, utilities, season parking and workers’ medical insurance. Based on cheque images extracted during investigations, these included the following:

>> (i)       For internet services, she issued 9 cheques to Singtel amounting to $18,491.86 and 21 cheques to My Republic Limited amounting to $5,661.50, between November 2012 and April 2016.

>> (ii)       For utilities consumed by the Ubi Road office, she issued 37 cheques amounting to $14,792.90, between January 2013 and April 2016.

>> (iii)       For season parking provided to the shell companies’ employees and to Eric and Steve Seet, she issued 13 cheques amounting to $6,220, between January 2013 and October 2015.

>> (iv)       For workers’ medical insurance, she issued three cheques amounting to $983.11, between March 2014 and March 2016.

> (e)     The Accused also issued a cheque transferring funds from one shell company to another ($5,474.07 was transferred from Best Laser to Erictex on 1 June 2015).

13     Apart from the above, the Accused assisted in the administrative matters of _legitimate_ businesses set up by Eric and Steven Seet, specifically a café, a coffee shop and a bakery.[^10] However, even as the Accused became more involved with administration of these legitimate businesses, she continued to assist Eric and Steven Seet with administration of the three shell companies.[^11]

14     As an administrative staff of the syndicate, the Accused was issued a username and password for the bookkeeping website ES123. She would access the ES123 website to key in the accounts of various companies and businesses, as and when instructed by Steven Seet to do so.[^12]

15     In providing administrative services to the three shell companies while knowing that they were a front for illegal gambling activities, the Accused intended to aid Eric and Steven Seet in their objective of providing Singapore-based remote gambling services.[^13] As a consequence of the Accused’s abetment, Eric and Steven Seet committed the offence of providing Singapore-based remote gambling services, under s 11(1) of the RGA.13 This forms the subject of the charge proceeded with against the Accused:

> You … are charged that you, from 2 February 2015 to 27 November 2016 (both dates inclusive), in Singapore, did abet by intentionally aiding \[Steven Seet\] and \[Eric Seet\] in the provision of Singapore-based remote gambling services through the \[asure6 and 888pool websites\], to wit, you aided \[Steven Seet\] and \[Eric Seet\] by performing duties of an administrative staff/accounts assistant for \[Steven Seet\] and \[Eric Seet\], which involved the performing of general administrative matters including that of issuing of cheques for rental of office units, electricity bills and internet usage, paying workers’ salaries, managing workers’ payrolls, applying of permits, managing workers’ CPF contributions, payout of petty cash to workers on claims, and helping workers to file their income taxes, which acts were crucial to the operation of the said websites by \[Steven Seet\] and \[Eric Seet\] and committed knowing that \[Eric Seet\] and \[Steven Seet\] were providing Singapore-based remote gambling services through \[the asure6 and 888pool websites\] during this period, and with intent to aid such purpose, offences of providing Singapore-based remote gambling services were committed by \[Steven Seet\] and \[Eric Seet\] in consequence of your abetment, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 11(1) of the Remote Gambling Act 2014 … read with Section 109 of the Penal Code …

(%3)       Although the Accused started working for Erictex in February 2012, the Prosecution explained that the charge cited 2 February 2015 as the commencement date of the offence because that was when the RGA came into force.[^14] The duration of the Accused’s offending under the charge thus spanned from 2 February 2015 to 27 November 2016 (22 months in total).

### Enlisting Sunny Lai into the syndicate

16     Sometime in 2013, Steven Seet told the Accused that he needed someone to help key in reports relating to illegal 4D activities. The Accused knew that Sunny Lai was looking to switch jobs and thus approached her. By then, the Accused was fully aware of the syndicate’s illegal activities.[^15] Still, she asked Sunny Lai if she was interested to work as an administrative staff for Steven Seet, stating that this would involve keying in data related to illegal gambling activities. Despite the illicit nature of the job, Sunny Lai agreed to take it as she was attracted by the salary.[^16] Sunny Lai started working for the syndicate in July 2013 and continued doing so until the end of October 2016.

17     Sunny Lai was eventually prosecuted with charges that were similar to those faced by the Accused. She pleaded guilty, admitting to the contents of a Statement of Facts (“Sunny Lai’s SOF”) which the Prosecution adduced at the hearing before me. Sunny Lai’s SOF (the contents of which were not challenged by the Accused) contained the following details of her involvement with the syndicate:

> (a)     Sunny Lai started work at the Ubi Road office in July 2013.[^17]

> (b)     She knew that the asure6 and 888pool websites were illegal 4D websites operated by the Seet brothers.[^18] She handled the administrative matters for both websites, as well as for other illegal gambling websites, including three horse racing websites and one TOTO website.23

> (c)     Sunny Lai opened up accounts on the asure6 website for players and gambling agents, thereby allowing them to place bets.[^19] She liaised directly with players and keyed their bets into the asure6 and 888pool websites, as well as the TOTO website.[^20]

> (d)     She acted as an intermediary for Eric Seet, liaising with gambling agents on his behalf.[^21] She monitored outstanding amounts owed by gambling agents and reported this to Eric Seet.[^22]

> (e)     Sunny Lai would log into the asure6 and 888pool websites and transfer data on winnings and losses into excel spreadsheets, which she then transferred to the bookkeeping website ES123.[^23] She also reported on any errors or issues with the websites.[^24]

> (f)     She also monitored the bank accounts used to issue or receive funds relating to the illegal gambling activities.[^25]

18     On a few occasions when Sunny Lai was absent from work, Steven Seet instructed the Accused to cover her duties by updating the ES123 website with illegal betting records (_eg_, payments from punters) and figures relating to illegal 4D bets from the 888pool website. The Accused did so by referring to a stack of guidelines that showed how to input data pertaining to the illegal gambling operations. The Accused also helped Philip Seet to enter some figures relating to illegal 4D bets into an Excel spreadsheet, before keying the same into the ES123 website.[^26]

### The end of the syndicate

19     Sometime in April 2016, the syndicate’s office at Ubi Road was closed. Steven Seet relocated Erictex’s operations to North Bridge Road, from where he also ran the bakery business. By then, the Accused was the only remaining worker left in Singapore,[^27] as Sunny Lai had left for Malaysia to assist Eric Seet with the illegal gambling operations there. The Accused continued to deal with HR and administrative matters for the shell companies run by Eric and Steven Seet, as well as for their legitimate businesses, until 27 November 2016.

20     In November 2016, after a prolonged period of intensified probes, the Police commenced arrests of persons connected with the syndicate.[^28] In total, 49 persons were arrested. This included the Accused, who was arrested on 2 May 2017 at the Woodlands Checkpoint.

21     Based on the betting records seized from Eric Seet, the total bets received by the asure6 website (from 22 November 2015 to 14 August 2016) was $18,207,212.62. However, this did not exhaustively reflect the total bets received, as not all the betting records were successfully retrieved.

### Remuneration from working at the syndicate

22     Investigations revealed that the Accused earned a monthly salary of $2,000 when she first started working for the syndicate in February 2012. This was raised to $3,000 at the start of 2016. She was thus estimated to have earned a total salary of about $103,000 from her work at the syndicate:[^29]

>   
| 

(a)

 | 

February 2012 to end of 2015:

($2,000 per month x 35 months)

 | 

$70,000

 |
| 

(b)

 | 

Start of 2016 to November 2016

($3,000 per month x 11 months)

 | 

$33,000

 |
| 

**Total:**

 | 

$103,000

 |

  
  

23     As for Sunny Lai, she worked at the syndicate from July 2013 to end October 2016.[^30] Like the Accused, she started with a monthly salary of $2,000, which was raised to $3,000 at the start of 2016. Sunny Lai was estimated to have earned a total salary of about $90,000 from her work at the syndicate:[^31]

>   
| 

(a)

 | 

July 2013 to end of 2015:

($2,000 per month x 30 months)

 | 

$60,000

 |
| 

(b)

 | 

Start of 2016 to October 2016

($3,000 per month x 10 months)

 | 

$30,000

 |
| 

**Total:**

 | 

$90,000

 |

  
  

### How Sunny Lai was dealt with

24     Sunny Lai was eventually charged with (largely) the same four offences as that brought against the Accused. However, unlike in the case of the Accused, against whom only one charge (under s 11(1) of the RGA) was proceeded with, the Prosecution proceeded with _two_ charges against Sunny Lai:

25     On 22 January 2019, Sunny Lai was sentenced by the District Court as follows:

>   
| 

(a)

 | 

Charge under s 11(1) of the RGA:

 | 

26 months’ imprisonment

 |
| 

(b)

 | 

Charge under s 5(1) of the OCA:

 | 

16 months’ imprisonment

 |
| 

Global sentence

(both sentences to run concurrently):

 | 

26 months’ imprisonment

 |

  
  

26     Sunny Lai appealed against her sentence. On 20 January 2020, the High Court allowed her appeal, reducing her sentence to the following:

>   
| 

(a)

 | 

Charge under s 11(1) of the RGA:

 | 

**18 months’ imprisonment**

 |
| 

(b)

 | 

Charge under s 5(1) of the OCA:

 | 

8 months’ imprisonment

 |
| 

Global sentence

(both sentences to run concurrently):

 | 

18 months’ imprisonment

 |

  
  

No written grounds of decision were issued by the High Court.

27     As can be seen, for the charge under s 11(1) of the RGA, Sunny Lai ultimately received an imprisonment term that was six months higher than the 12-month term that I imposed on the Accused for the same offence.

## Antecedents

28     The Accused has no criminal antecedents.

## Parties’ Submissions on Sentence

29     During the hearing before me, the Prosecution sought an imprisonment term of 12 months,[^32] while the Defence sought the “lowest possible fine”.[^33] Parties’ respective submissions on sentence are set out below.

### Defence’s plea in mitigation

30     The Defence sought to distinguish the Accused’s role in the syndicate, arguing that she was much less culpable than Sunny Lai. The Defence drew an analogy, saying that the Accused’s culpability was similar to that of a chauffeur who merely drove her boss around, albeit with some knowledge of the boss’ illegal activities.[^34] The Accused, argued the Defence, was not a core person within the syndicate as she performed only the “peripheral functions” of an administrative staff.[^35] For example, while the Accused may have performed HR functions, she had no power over the employment and remuneration of employees.[^36] Although she issued cheques, she had no discretion when doing so as all instructions regarding amount and payee came from Eric or Steven Seet.[^37] In short, she was just doing all the “innocent and innocuous” activities of a clerk.[^38] In contrast, Sunny Lai played a more active role, liaising with gamblers directly, opening accounts for them on the gambling websites, punching in their bets and conducting assessments of the gambling accounts.[^39]

31     The Defence highlighted that the Accused was not even aware of the other parties within the syndicate’s organisational chart, as she interacted only with the Seet brothers and Sunny Lai.[^40] In contrast, Sunny Lai acted as Eric Seet’s intermediary in liaising with the syndicate’s gambling agents.

32     The Defence explained that the Accused’s job responsibilities straddled both the illegal betting business and the legitimate businesses of the café and coffee shop.[^41] The Accused had performed a bookkeeping role and, to that end, was granted password access to the ES123 website which was used to house the accounting records of both the betting operations and the (legitimate) businesses of the café and coffee shop.[^42] The Defence contended that the Accused’s involvement was mainly with the legitimate side of the house and alleged that she hardly had any involvement with Erictex, as Erictex had little business activity.[^43] To bolster the claim that the Accused’s involvement with the illegal betting business was minimal, the Defence alleged[^44] that while the Accused had accessed the ES123 website multiple times, it was only _once_ that she did so to enter illegal betting records. On all the other occasions where she accessed the ES123 website, it was to update the accounting records of the legitimate businesses.[^45] When the Prosecution pointed out[^46] that this claim ran counter to the SOF, which stated that the Accused had updated the ES123 website with illegal betting records “_on a few occasions_”[^47] (and not just once), the Defence countered that this aspect of the SOF was “defective”. [^48] This was despite the Accused having accepted the SOF without qualification when pleading guilty. The Prosecution thus suggested holding a Newton Hearing to resolve this point but the Defence subsequently abandoned its challenge to the SOF.[^49]

33     The Defence also adduced a testimonial showing that the Accused had (since 2017) performed 652 hours of community service with the Singapore Society for the Physically Disabled.

34     As regards the request for “the lowest possible fine”, the Defence did not tender any authorities to show why this case fell outside the custodial threshold.

### Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

35     The Prosecution contended that given the inherent difficulty in detecting remote gambling offences, the relevant sentencing principle here was that of general deterrence.[^50] Against that backdrop, the Prosecution argued for an imprisonment term of 12 months, citing the harm caused by the offence and the culpability of the Accused.

36     As regards the harm caused, the Prosecution argued that the harm here was measurable by (a) the value of the bets collected or distributed; and (b) the number of punters involved. Both these factors, argued the Prosecution, gave an indication of the gambling operation’s size.[^51] Here, the total value of the bets (as gleaned from the betting records seized) was enormous, standing at $18,207,212.62. Even then, caveated the Prosecution, the seized betting records were not exhaustive −not all the betting records had been successfully retrieved. This meant that the actual value of the bets collected would have been larger.[^52] As a further indicator of the operation’s size (and hence of the harm caused by the syndicate), the Prosecution pointed out that apart from the two agents and two shareholders under the Seet brothers, there were at least another 12 agents in the syndicate’s associated clusters.[^53]

37     As regards the Accused’s culpability, the Prosecution’s position was in accord with that of the Defence, to the extent that both sides agreed that the Accused’s culpability was lower than that of Sunny Lai. The Prosecution accepted that Sunny Lai’s job scope was, on its face, more directly connected to the illegal gambling websites.[^54]

38     In its initial submissions, the Prosecution also submitted that a fine of $55,000 should be imposed on the Accused, over and above the imprisonment term sought.[^55] However, during the course of oral submissions, the Prosecution withdrew its submission for the fine.[^56]

## Decision

39     Having heard both sides, I concluded that the appropriate sentence in this case was an imprisonment term of 12 months.

40     I agreed with the Prosecution that the predominant sentencing consideration here was general deterrence. That consideration assumes particular importance in offences that are inherently difficult to detect: see _Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> at \[25(d)\]. During the second reading of the Remote Gambling Bill (Bill No 23 of 2014) (_Singapore Parliamentary Debates_, _Official Report_ (7 October 2014) vol 92, Member of Parliament Edwin Tong had, in rising to support the bill, observed (at p 11):

> … gambling will continue to take place, and it will be worse if driven underground, especially given the virtual terrain in which these activities operate which make it inherently difficult to detect.

The challenge inherent in detecting and tackling remote gambling operations was illustrated in the present case, where the syndicate used three shell companies as a front for its activities and the police moved in only after a prolonged period of intensified probes.[^57] To the extent that potential offenders may look upon assisting in such illegal operations as an easy way to make a living with minimal risk of getting caught, a message needs to be sent out that they will, if caught, be dealt with appropriately.

41     Bearing the above sentencing consideration in mind, I moved on to consider the harm and culpability involved in this case.

### Harm

42     I agreed with the Prosecution that for offences involving the running of gambling operations, the size of the bets collected is a key measure of the harm caused. For cases involving terrestrial gambling operations, there is a close correlation between the size of the bets collected and the sentence ultimately imposed. In _Lim Li Ling v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 1 SLR(R) 165</span>, the offender was charged with assisting in carrying on a public lottery, under s 5(a) of the Common Gaming Houses Act (Cap 49, 1985 Rev Ed). Tay Yong Kwang J (as his Honour then was) held (at \[92\]):

> The amount of the bets involved gave an indication as to the size of the illegal operation. The magistrate was therefore eminently justified in considering the total bet value of $55,000 when sentencing the appellant.

The same yardstick, _ie_, total amount of bets collected, is equally applicable when ascertaining the harm arising from remote gambling operations.

43     In the present case, the size of the bets collected was huge: $18,207,212.62. Even then, as pointed out by the Prosecution, the betting records seized were not exhaustive, meaning that the total amount of bets was likely above that figure.[^58]

44     As both the Accused and Sunny Lai were involved in the same criminal enterprise, I was of the view that the harm attributable to their respective actions should be pegged at about the same level. If there was going to be any divergence in their sentences, this would have been attributable not so much to differences in the harm caused but in their respective culpabilities.

### Culpability

45     There were several common aggravating factors which presented themselves in the cases of both the Accused and Sunny Lai. For example:

> (a)     Both the Accused and Sunny Lai committed the offences as part of a syndicate. This is an aggravating factor in and of itself: see _Logachev Vladislav v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 609</span> (_Logachev Vladislav_), where Sundaresh Menon CJ remarked (at \[53\]):

>> I regard the involvement of a syndicate as in and of itself aggravating, and this should not be confused or conflated with other factors that are separately aggravating, such as premeditation, sophistication and planning. Syndicate involvement raises the spectre of organised crime and this has deleterious effects on Singapore as a whole.

> (b)     Both the Accused and Sunny Lai assisted in a criminal enterprise with transnational reach. This too was an aggravating factor: see _Logachev Vladislav_ (at \[53\]). The Accused was fully aware that the syndicate had operations across the Causeway.

There was also a mitigating factor common to both the Accused and Sunny Lai, in that they pleaded guilty, thereby saving valuable court time.

46     Where the culpability of the Accused differed from that of Sunny Lai lay in the exact nature of her tasks with the syndicate. In this respect, both the Prosecution and Defence agreed that the Accused’s culpability was of a lower order as compared to Sunny Lai. Specifically, both sides agreed that Sunny Lai’s tasks within the syndicate were more _closely connected_ to the illegal gambling websites.

47     I was prepared to accept the common position of both parties, _ie_, that given the nature of the Accused’s tasks within the syndicate, her culpability was less than that of Sunny Lai. That being the case, the Accused would deserve a lower sentence than the 18-month imprisonment term imposed on Sunny Lai. The principle of parity in sentencing dictates that an offender with a more culpable role in a criminal enterprise be dealt with more severely than a co-accused with a lesser role: see _Chong Han Rui v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 25</span> (“_Chong Han Rui_”) at \[42\]. This principle rests on the need to preserve public confidence in the administration of justice: co-offenders in a common criminal enterprise must not be seen as having been sentenced in an unduly disparate manner, as the appearance of arbitrariness could raise fundamental rule of law concerns: see _Chong Han Rui_ at \[47\].

48     The Prosecution parted ways with the Defence when it came to the extent to which the Accused’s sentence should fall below that imposed on Sunny Lai. As explained above, the Prosecution sought 12 months’ imprisonment, _ie_, two-thirds the 18-month term imposed by the High Court on Sunny Lai, while the Defence argued for the lowest possible fine. However, I did not think that the differential in culpability was particularly significant. The Defence argued that the Accused was just a clerk, performing “innocent and innocuous” HR and administrative functions.[^59] I thought that this claim grossly understated the pivotal role played by the Accused in supporting the criminal enterprise. As I mentioned above, remote gambling operations are inherently difficult to detect. By tending to the administration of the shell companies, knowing fully well that they were a front, the Accused purposefully maintained the very artifice that allowed the criminal enterprise to fly under the radar. As stated in the SOF, the shell companies were crucial to the operation of the asure6 and 888pool websites.[^60]

49     The Accused’s tasks were extensive: managing the payroll, paying salaries, managing CPF contributions, applying for permits, filing tax returns, handling petty cash claims and issuing cheques for rental and utilities. Even after the syndicate stripped its operations down in April 2016, the Accused remained as the _sole employee_ in the Singapore operations (see paragraph 19 above), where she continued to handle administrative matters for the shell companies. It was thus clear that she was not an inconsequential cog in the machinery. Rather, the SOF stated that the Accused’s administrative role vis-à-vis the shell companies was _crucial_ to the operation of the syndicate’s remote gambling services.[^61]

50     In light of this, the Accused’s attempt to liken her function to that of a chauffeur who merely drove her boss around was beguiling. If resort must be had to a driving analogy, the Accused’s role was more akin to that of an accomplice who knowingly drove the getaway van for a burglar who targeted house after house, over an extended period of time.

51     I recognised that the Accused’s tasks in the syndicate straddled both illegal and legitimate businesses. However, this did not in any way reduce the culpability for her involvement with the illegal side of the house.

52     Hence, while I was prepared to accept the position that the Accused was less culpable than Sunny Lai, I was of the view that given the nature and extent of the Accused’s role, that difference in culpability was limited. I also bore in mind the following salient considerations:

> (a)     The Accused worked with the syndicate for a significantly longer duration than Sunny Lai, by close to one-and-a-half years. Specifically, the Accused started working for the syndicate in February 2012, while Sunny Lai started only in July 2013.

> (b)     The Accused did not play a merely passive role in the syndicate. When a job vacancy arose, it was the Accused who enlisted Sunny Lai into the syndicate’s operations. This was not a case of the Accused unwittingly roping a friend into what she thought was a legitimate enterprise. The Accused knew, as at the point of recommending the job, that Sunny Lai would be drawn into supporting illegal gambling operations. Lured by the remuneration, Sunny Lai accepted. The Accused cannot shirk responsibility for that.

53     As such, I was not fully convinced by the Prosecution’s submission that the Accused’s sentence should be pegged at only two-thirds of that imposed on Sunny Lai. There was a good case for going above that. However, in the absence of submissions, I decided against imposing an imprisonment term exceeding the 12 months sought by the Prosecution. As for the Defence’s request for the _lowest possible fine_, this was way off the ballpark and only served to underscore the Accused’s abject lack of appreciation for the gravity of her actions.

54     I also took account of the hours spent by the Accused serving the Singapore Society for the Physically Disabled. The weight to be accorded to community service may be offset where the interests of general deterrence dictate that a strong message be sent to others who may be minded to follow in the footsteps of the offender: see _Stansilas Fabian Kester v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 755</span> (“_Stansilas_”) (at \[100\]). Given that general deterrence was the predominant sentencing consideration in this case (see paragraph 40 above), I was of the view that the Accused’s hours of community service carried modest impact. Furthermore, to the extent that the Defence was seeking to show that the Accused’s community service augured well for her propensity for reform, it had to demonstrate the connection between the community service and her capacity and willingness to change for the better: see _Stansilas_ (at \[101\]). Unfortunately, the plea in mitigation failed to give any elaboration of that.

### Whether a fine should be imposed over and above the imprisonment term

55     As explained above, the Prosecution had initially asked for the imposition of a fine on the Accused, over and above the imprisonment term of 12 months. In support of its submission, the Prosecution referred to _Lim Li Ling v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 1 SLR(R) 165</span>, where Tay J interpreted s 5(a) of the CGHA as conferring a discretion on the sentencing judge to impose a fine over and above the imprisonment term. Tay J stressed (at \[91\]) that in holding that a fine was discretionary for the offence of assisting in carrying on a public lottery, his Honour was neither advocating that fines be awarded sparingly, nor exhorting courts to depart from the sentencing practice of imposing _both_ a fine and a prison term. The Prosecution thus asked that I follow the same sentencing practice and impose a fine on the Accused, over and above imprisonment.

56     As regards the fine quantum, the Prosecution suggested $55,000. To recap, the Accused earned a total salary of $103,000 for the entire duration of her employment with the syndicate, from early February 2012 to end November 2016 (see paragraph 22 above). The $55,000 was a subset of that, representing the salary earned by her within the window of time specified in the charge,[^62] from 2 February 2015 (when the RGA came into force) to end November 2016. The Prosecution explained that a fine was necessary to disgorge the profits derived by the Accused from the illegal gambling business.[^63] The Prosecution relied on the case of _Koh Jaw Hung v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 516</span> (“_Koh Jaw Hung_”), where the High Court held (at \[44\]) that a fine may be imposed not only as a means of punishment but also as a rough and ready method for disgorging the proceeds of crime.

57     In _Koh Jaw Hung_, the revenue from the vice operations went directly to the offender. In determining the appropriate quantum of the fine that would effectively disgorge the offender of his benefits, the High Court looked at elements such as the offender’s expenses, to see if these should be deducted from the revenue figure to give a more accurate reflection of the benefits reaped (at \[48\]). In contrast, what the Prosecution sought to disgorge here was the Accused’s monthly salary. I would thus have required submissions from the Prosecution as to how the principle of disgorgement (as enunciated in _Koh Jaw Hung_) applied to _salaried_ offenders whose remuneration (being constant) bore no correlation with the profits earned or losses sustained from the criminal enterprise. Furthermore, I note that the $55,000 sought to be disgorged constituted the _entire_ salary earned by the Accused during the timeframe specified in the charge. I had my doubts whether this was correct, given that the Accused’s administrative tasks straddled not only the illegal betting operations but the legitimate businesses as well. On the assumption that the Accused’s salary could properly be the subject of disgorgement, I would have required submissions on why the Accused should be made to disgorge the full $55,000, as opposed to just part of the salary earned during the timeframe specified in the charge.

58     I asked the Prosecution why a fine should be imposed here, given that the High Court saw fit _not_ to impose a fine on Sunny Lai (despite the Prosecution asking for it), when the same principle of disgorgement advanced by the Prosecution here would (if relevant) have been applicable there as well. After considering my query, the Prosecution decided that, for parity with the sentence imposed on Sunny Lai, it would withdraw its submission for a fine.[^64]

## Conclusion

59     As such, I imposed an imprisonment term of 12 months on the Accused.
