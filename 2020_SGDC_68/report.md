23 March 2020

### District Judge May Lucia Mesenas:

## Background

The accused, 20 years old, pleaded guilty to two charges under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”), namely, one count of drug trafficking of cannabis[^1] and one count of consumption of a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA[^2], namely, Nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid (or cannabinol derivative). One other count of drug trafficking of 3.07 grams of cannabis mixture as well as being in possession of 4.99 grams of the same[^3], were taken into consideration (“TIC”) for the purposes of sentencing.

2       I called for both Probation and Reformative Training Suitability reports (“probation report” and “RT report” respectively) where the accused was assessed to be suitable for both probation and reformative training (level 1 intensity of rehabilitation).

3       On 21 January 2020, the accused was sentenced to 27 months’ split probation (12 months’ intensive, 15 months’ supervised) with the following conditions, in that, the accused is:

> a)     To remain indoors daily from 10pm to 6am;

> b)     To be on electronic monitoring for a period of 12 months;

> d)     To perform 240 hours of community service;

> e)     To undergo regular and random urine tests;

> f)     To attend a drug intervention programme;

> g)     To undergo psychiatric and psychological treatment, if necessary;

> h)     To comply with medication as prescribed by the psychiatrist, if necessary;

4       In addition, the accused’s parents were ordered to execute a bond in the sum of $5,000 to ensure his good behaviour.

5       On the same day, upon the application of the prosecution, a stay of the probation order was granted. On 22 January 2020, the prosecution filed the Notice of Appeal against sentence and the accused is currently on bail.

## Charges

6       The two proceeded charges state as follows:

> DAC 921343/2019

> You, Tan Tristen Joshua Rae Len, male/20 years old, are charged that you, on 24 July 2019, at or about 10.00 am, at West Coast Plaza Shopping Mall level 1, beside Toast Box, Singapore, did traffic in a controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”), _to wit_, by selling one packet containing not more than 8.53 grams of vegetable matter, which was analysed and found to be cannabis, for not more than $490 to Sgt Chung Kian Chong, an officer of the Central Narcotics Bureau, at the said location, without authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 5(1)(a) punishable under Section 33(1) of the MDA.

> DAC 923090/2019

> You, Tan Tristen Joshua Rae Len, male/20 years old are charged that you, on or before 24 July 2019, in Singapore, did consume a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”), _to wit_, 11-Nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid, without any authorisation under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 8(b)(ii) punishable under Section 33(3A) of the MDA.

7       The following two charges were TIC for purposes of sentencing:

> DAC 921342/2019

> You, Tan Tristen Joshua Rae Len, male/20 years old are charged that you, on 18 July 2019, at or about 4.40pm, at the bus-stop in front of Beauty World MRT Station, Singapore, did traffic in a controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Chapter 185, 2008 Rev Ed) )(“MDA”), _to wit_, by selling one packet containing not less than 3.07 grams of vegetable matter, which was analysed and found to contain cannabinol and tetrahydrocannabinol, for not more than $70 to Sgt Chung Kian Chong, an officer of the Central Narcotics Bureau, at the said location, without authorization under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 5(1)(a) and punishable under Section 33(1) of the MDA.

> DAC 926654/2019

> You, Tan Tristen Joshua Rae Len, male/20 years old, are charged that you, on 24 July 2019, at or about 1030am at Blk 58 West Coast Road #XXX Varsity Park Condominium, in Singapore, did have in your possession a Class A Controlled Drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse Drugs Act (Chapter 185, 2008 Rev Ed)(“MDA”), to wit, two packets containing not less than 4.99 grams of fragmented vegetable matter, which was analysed and found to contain cannabinol and tetrahydrocannabinol, without any authorization under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 8(a) punishable under section 33(1) of the MDA.

## Summary of Facts

8       The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts pertaining to the above charges, without qualification. The salient points are as follows:

> DAC 921343/2019 (Drug Trafficking charge)

> (a)     Between 21 July to 24 July 2019, an arrangement was made between the accused and an undercover Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) officer, Sgt Chun Kian Chong (“undercover CNB officer”) to meet at West Coast Plaza Shopping Mall, Singapore, at about 10am, for the undercover CNB officer to purchase one packet of cannabis from the accused for $490.

> (b)     The accused met the said undercover CNB officer at the said time and location to sell the cannabis. The accused passed the said drugs (“exhibit”) to the undercover CNB officer, who in turn, handed over cash of $490 to the accused. When the transaction was completed, the accused walked away and was subsequently arrested.

> (c)     On 25 July 2019, the said exhibit was sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis.

> (d)     On 4 September 2019, the said exhibit was found to contain 8.53 grams of cannabis, a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA.

> DAC 923090/2019 (Drug Consumption charge)

> (e)     After the accused was arrested on the same day as stated above, he provided two bottles of his urine samples, which were also sent to the HSA for analysis. It was subsequently found to contain 11-Nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid, a cannabinol derivative, which is a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA.

## Antecedents

9       The accused is a first offender.

## Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

10     The prosecution submitted for a RT report to be called only and objected to the court calling for a probation report. In the main, the prosecution submitted that the offences committed by the accused are serious, in particular, that of drug trafficking as seen in the prescribed punishment which carries a mandatory minimum imprisonment term of five years and five strokes of the cane. In that regard, there was thus a need for deterrence within an overarching focus on rehabilitation which RT provides. Citing the case of _Praveen s/o Krishnan v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1300</span> at \[28\] (“_Praveen_”), it is submitted that whilst rehabilitation is generally the dominant sentencing consideration for young offenders below 21 years old, this consideration is outweighed by the need for deterrence for offences such as drug trafficking (see also the case of _PP v Adith s/o Sarvothan_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 103</span> at \[14\] (“_Adith_”)). Additionally, the seriousness of the offences is reflected in the multiple drug-related charges which the accused faces.

11     In relation to his substance abuse history, the accused had admitted to Dr Winslow that he had not only consumed cannabis but also consumed Ecstasy as well (see Dr Winslow’s report at \[14\]), thereby suggesting a need to deter the accused in consuming multiple types of drugs.

12     Furthermore, the accused had committed the offences when he was 20 years 6 months old, just six months shy of turning 21 years old, where the accused would have been ‘less influenced’ by his peers as compared to a 16-year old. It was thus submitted that given that the accused was at the ‘tail end of the spectrum’ of young offenders below 21 years old where rehabilitation would be the dominant sentencing consideration, deterrence, on the other hand, should instead take centre-stage.

## Mitigation

13     In his mitigation plea, the accused, who was represented by counsel, highlighted the circumstances leading to the commission of the drug offences in that he commenced smoking cannabis from the middle of January 2019 through the bad influence of his friends that he met in the international schools in Singapore. He experimented in cannabis to relieve his insomnia and to fuel his creativity in writing songs. Further, he decided to sell cannabis to supplement his National Service (“NS”) allowance and was eventually arrested in a CNB sting operation in July 2019.

14     The accused is the elder of two children in the family where his father’s job in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (“MFA”) necessitated the entire family moving to different countries due to the various postings overseas. This resulted in the accused attending schools in different countries[^4].

15     The accused was serving NS and was due to complete the stint in February 2020. Prior to NS, the accused had completed the International Baccalaureate (“IB”) programme in Marlborough College, Malaysia. He has plans to pursue tertiary studies in Psychology after his NS. He had received offers for acceptance into foundation programmes at Monash University and University of Sydney. He was also in the process of applying to study in the universities abroad as well as locally.

16     The defence further highlighted the following mitigating factors[^5] in support of the court calling for a probation report instead of a RT report at first instance:

> a)     The accused is a young offender for which the circumstances leading to the commission of the offences were not borne out of any deep-seated criminality but instead reflect a ‘foolish and immature state of mind then’.

> b)     The accused comes from an intact Christian family that provides strong familial support. The accused’s parents (“the parents”) have counselled him over the incident and will monitor him closely to ensure that he does not get involved in similar incidents. His mother has relocated back to Singapore to ensure that the accused will be more closely supervised in future. His father, has also requested and MFA has approved his re-assignment back to Singapore after his current overseas posting ends on 2 January 2020 to allow him to support the accused in his rehabilitation. Despite being posted overseas (after the accused’s arrest in July 2019), the father speaks to the accused on the phone every night and has in fact returned back to Singapore for every court date save for one. He is also very much involved in the accused’s education, by attending meetings with the accused and his education consultants to help him rationalise his choice of university applications.

> c)     The accused has cut off all contact with his negative peers and has resolved to steer away from them in future. To that end, the accused has been attending church services regularly, following his arrest in July 2019 and his pastor has been connecting him with prosocial friends to provide a good community as a source of support for him[^6].

> d)     The accused is extremely remorseful for his actions and promised that he will cherish the chance to repent and not re-offend again. In his letter setting out his remorse for the commission of the offences, he vows not to disappoint his parents.

> e)     The accused had a short history of consuming and selling cannabis which began in January 2019 and ceased in July 2019 when he was arrested. He is not a drug addict and has steered clear from all illegal substances as confirmed in the urine tests conducted (see Dr Munidasa Winslow’s report dated 4 November 2019) (“Dr Winslow’s report”). Whilst the accused used to be a social drinker and was smoking regularly prior to his arrest, he has since abstained from alcohol and completely curbed his unhealthy smoking habit.

> f)     When the accused was a child, he was diagnosed to have Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (“ADHD”). In March 2018, the accused consulted Dr Ung Eng Khean (“Dr Ung”) for high levels of anxiety accompanied by insomnia prior to his NS enlistment. A diagnosis of a Generalized Anxiety Disorder (“GAD”) was made together with ADHD and possible Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (“PTSD”). To cope with this condition, the accused undergoes psychotherapy treatment with Dr Harold Robers (“Dr Robers”)[^7], a clinical psychologist, who has assessed the accused to be ‘_very receptive and engaging in psychotherapy_..’ He further opined that the accused now ‘_realises how the influence of certain peers mislead (sic) him while he was in boarding school. His past has affected him developmentally and emotionally as he had to move because of his parent’s work assignments, every three years since a young child. Geographically and socially, he has not had a secure emotional and friendship base and because of this, was less discerning of the peers he engaged with… He does not appear to have an addiction or dependence to the drugs or any other substance, and he is taking on self-responsibility and strong resolve to change radically_.’

> g)     The accused’s early plea of guilt indicates his deepest remorse and regret.

> h)     The accused has also fully co-operated with CNB throughout the entire investigations.

> i)     The accused is a first offender and not a hardened criminal.

> j)     The various testimonials provided by the accused’s NS superiors, Housemaster of Marlborough College Malaysia as well as tutors of International Community School, give glimpses of the accused’s positive character, potential and ability to improve for the future. In a recent NS appraisal[^8], he was commended as ‘_a conscientious and dependable worker who takes pride in his work and show dedication to his work and exhibits a strong sense of responsibility and professionalism. He has a great personality and is able to work and get along very well with his peers_’.

17     The accused’s parents were also greatly concerned that the accused may be subject to negative influences if he is sentenced to RT. The adverse effect may be exacerbated due to his psychiatric history of GAD and ADHD if major environmental changes occur and he is deprived of his familial support.

## Discretion to call for Pre-sentence reports

18     In calling for the pre-sentence reports to determine his suitability for probation as well as RT, I took into account the accused’s lack of antecedents and counsel’s arguments relating to his capacity for reform. I also note that he had not posed any disciplinary problems in school or in NS. All his testimonials spoke well of him. At the same time, RT could be an alternative to the prescribed mandatory sentences of imprisonment and caning. As such, both reports were called for.

## Recommendations in the pre-sentence reports

19     The pre-sentence reports found the accused to be suitable for probation and RT. I carefully considered the RT report prepared by Ms Vanessa Tang Kar Wei (“Ms Tang”), the Correctional Rehabilitation Specialist, as well as the probation report prepared by Ms How Shi Ying (“Ms How”), the Probation Officer (“PO”).

20     In the RT report, the accused’s main risk factor identified was his association with peers of negative influence when he relocated back to Singapore in 2017 till his arrest in July 2019. Most of these peers comprised international acquaintances whom he met at school. He was introduced to cannabis by some of them. Specifically, they would consume cannabis during parties[^9]. On the other hand, the RT report also noted that the accused shared a warm and supportive relationship with his family. He had done reasonably well in school and attained the IB diploma in 2017. While in NS, he completed his assigned duties efficiently and had no disciplinary problems with his superiors and NS mates. It was noted that the accused ‘presented with few needs for intervention’. In particular, he had taken efforts to abstain from illicit drugs and ceased association with anti-social peers since his arrest in July 2019. In addition, his receptiveness towards his family, willingness to take responsibility for his actions, to undergo counselling for his drug use and insomnia, as well as efforts made to spend his leisure time in pro-social pursuits[^10], have gone some way in mitigating these risk factors.

21     The PO in her probation report, had similarly echoed these protective factors. It was further assessed that the accused’s involvement in the offences reflected his disregard for the law and willingness to take risks for pleasure and monetary gains. She had also observed that the parents’ absence due to their work commitments could have led the accused to seek relatedness outside the family. It would appear that this in turn resulted in the accused’s association with those who endorsed the use and sale of drugs as contributing to his offending. The lack of supervision further allowed him to lead an unbridled lifestyle and also allowed his drug-taking habits and drug trafficking activities to go undetected[^11]. His parents have since made changes to their work arrangements to ensure that there is close supervision of the accused. They have been closely monitoring his movements and associations to ensure that he stayed clear of negative influences[^12].

22     The accused has expressed regret and felt that he had disappointed his parents. He had acknowledged that he had failed to consider the consequences of his actions. It was further reported by the PO that the accused was forthcoming and co-operative, which was also corroborated by the Investigation Officer (“IO”) for the current drug charges[^13]. He had also abided by the bail conditions which stipulates a time curfew of 10pm to 6am and the accused was also found to be at home during surprise physical checks made by the PO.

23     Apart from the accused’s commitment towards wanting to sustain the changes he had made following his arrest in July 2019, the PO has reported that his parents have also been forthcoming and co-operative, acknowledging that their lack of supervision in the past, contributed to the accused’s offending. They have also attributed the accused’s offending to his poor consequential thinking and susceptibility to peer influence. They have since expressed willingness to attend programmes where necessary and were committed to returning home by 10pm to ensure that the accused abides by the time curfew should probation be granted. In fact, they have been tracking the accused’s location via a mobile phone application to monitor his whereabouts and his mother has shared that she will continue to check his mobile phone, email and his room to look out for signs of any drug relapse[^14].

## Prosecution’s further submissions

24     In addition to the points raised earlier in \[10\] to \[12\] above, the prosecution submitted for RT to be imposed for the following reasons:

> a)     The accused has a history of drug abuse, which was not one-off. In fact, he had first experimented with cannabis when he was residing in Cairo, Egypt, between the ages of 9-12 years old. Thereafter, in 2017, at the age of 18, the accused consumed cannabis and had even consumed Ecstasy when he was on holiday with friends in Thailand. Subsequently, he started to consume one to two joints of cannabis within one to two days in January 2019, which increased to four to five joints daily in March 2019. Given the escalation of the accused’s drug abuse habit, which further contextualises the severity of his offences currently before the court, it was submitted that this further supports the fact that more weight ought to be placed on deterrence.

> b)     Given that rehabilitation would be the dominant sentencing consideration for young offenders aged 21 years old and below (see _PP v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 439</span> at \[21\] (“_Maurice Mok”_)), the accused, who was 20 years old 6 months when he committed the current offences, would thus have been at ‘the tail end of the spectrum’. In that regard, he would have been more aware of the consequences of his actions and less likely to be influenced as compared to a 16-year old, who would have been considered as someone who was at the start of the spectrum. It was submitted that the accused would have been well aware of the ‘illegality of his actions’ as his previous drug supplier as well as a friend, had been arrested for drug offences, in March 2019 and May 2019, respectively. This resulted in the accused curbing his consumption and drug trafficking activities for brief periods following their respective arrests. However, this was short-lived as he remained undeterred and continued abusing drugs and trafficking in drugs subsequently in April 2019 and June/July 2019. It was thus submitted that specific deterrence would be a relevant sentencing consideration given the accused’s continued drug activities despite the arrests of his friend and drug supplier respectively, which should have served as ‘wake-up calls’ for the accused.

> c)     The accused had informed the PO that he had started trafficking in drugs in January 2019 whereas, he had reported to the RT officer that he had done the same in April 2019 instead. Given the accused’s inconsistent accounts as to when he started trafficking in drugs to the PO and the RT officer respectively, it was submitted that the accused had downplayed his culpability, thus showing a lack of remorse.

> d)     The accused had committed the drug trafficking offences out of greed as he wanted to supplement his income to fund his leisure activities, thus evincing a complete disregard for the law, which further supports the fact that more weight ought to be placed on the need for deterrence over rehabilitation.

> e)     Given that the offence of drug trafficking is a serious crime and the fact that the accused’s personal circumstances are not so exceptional as to warrant the imposition of a probation order, it was thus submitted that to impose such a sentence, which has its focus on rehabilitation, would send a wrong message to young offenders.

## Defence Submissions

25     In reply to prosecution’s submissions, the defence made the following points:

> a)     It was clarified by the defence that the accused had informed the RT officer that he had started trafficking drugs in April 2019 but it was not meant to downplay his culpability or responsibility. He was unable to recall why he had informed her of the same. That said, the accused was prepared to accept that he had started selling drugs in January 2019 and takes full responsibility.

> b)     The prosecution’s submission that rehabilitation should feature less given that the accused is _almost_ 21 years old when he committed the current offences, is not supported by any case law. Instead, it is clearly stated in the High Court case of _Maurice Mok_ (_supra_) that the distinction in the sentencing approach to be given is that between young offenders below 21 years old on one hand, and adult offenders above 21 on the other, where rehabilitation would be the dominant sentencing consideration for those below 21 years old.

> c)     The fact that the accused knew that what he was doing was illegal was no different from the other young offenders below 21 years old who were convicted of similar drug offences and sentenced to probation (see cases of _Praveen, PP v Leon Russel Francis \[2014\] 4SLR 651_ (_“Leon Russel Francis”_)_, PP v Justin Heng Zheng Hao <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGDC 219</span>_ (_“Justin Heng”_))_._ It was thus submitted that prosecution’s emphasis on this is a ‘red herring’ and should not be a factor that strongly feature in the court’s consideration in determining the appropriate sentence.

> d)     The fact that the accused had committed the offences out of greed, is accepted by the defence. Neither is the accused making any excuses for what he has done and the defence submits that credit ought to be given to him for taking full responsibility in that regard.

> e)     The multiple drug offences committed by the accused is not the worst of its kind as there were other young offenders, convicted for similar drug trafficking charges (and in some instances, facing more drug charges as compared to the current accused), who were sentenced to probation (see cases of _Praveen, Leon Russel Francis, Justin Heng_ and _PP v Ng Stephanie Tin_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGDC 274</span> (“_Ng Stephanie Tin_”)). The fact that the accused faces an additional drug trafficking charge which was TIC, should not be a factor which takes him out of the consideration for probation.

26     It was thus submitted that in view of the accused’s demonstrably high capacity for rehabilitation, as corroborated by the probation and RT reports, a sentence of probation would be the most appropriate. The stringent conditions as recommended by the PO do not in any way show that the accused would be treated with kid gloves and the 27-month probation period far outstrips the minimum detention of six months which he would have to serve under the RT order. Additionally, it was contended that should the accused not comply with the conditions under the probation order or run afoul of the law during the period of probation, the default mandatory imprisonment term and caning which would be imposed, would inevitably be a strong deterrent to ensure that he does not do so.

## Decision of the court

### Sentencing considerations in relation to a young offender

27     I am mindful of the competing sentencing considerations of deterrence and rehabilitation when deciding on the appropriate sentence for the accused, a young offender, who has committed serious offences. That said, as a starting point, rehabilitation is generally the dominant sentencing consideration when deciding on an appropriate sentence for a young offender aged 21 years and below (see _Maurice Mok_ (_supra_) at \[21\] and followed in _Leon Russel Francis (supra)_ at \[13\] (“_Leon Russel Francis”_)).

28     Turning briefly to the prosecution’s submission that the accused had committed the offences when he was almost turning 21 years old, in which case, rehabilitation as a sentencing principle ought to have less of a focus in the sentence to be imposed. I had no reason to reject the defence’s reply to such a submission, which is clearly not supported by case law (see \[27\] above). In fact, past offenders above the age of 21 years old, have been sentenced to probation where the circumstances justify it or where the law does not prohibit such an order. As such, I did not think it was tenable to suggest that an offender who is closer to 21 years old, ‘ought to have known better’ and therefore, not be considered for any rehabilitative sentence.

29     As observed by Steven Chong JA in _Praveen_ (_supra_) at \[29\], in considering whether rehabilitation retains its primacy in the sentencing matrix, the court should consider whether the particular offender’s _capacity for rehabilitation_ is demonstrably high, so that it outweighs the public policy concerns that are traditionally understood as militating against probation (citing _Justin Heng_ (_supra)_ at \[13\] and \[15\] and followed in _Leon Russel Francis_ (_supra_) at \[14\]). In this regard, the main objective of rehabilitating young offenders is to wean them off a life-time career in crime and to reform them into “self-reliant and useful citizens”: see _PP v Muhammad Nuzaihan bin Kamal Luddin_ \[1999\] 3 SLR (R) 653 at \[16\]. Thus, the ultimate question is whether there are ‘conditions conducive to the accused turning away from his erstwhile ways and leading a productive life in future’.

30     In determining the young offender’s capacity for rehabilitation and the appropriate sentence, the following considerations set out in _Praveen_ at \[30\] (citing _Leon Russel Francis_ at \[15\]) are relevant:

> (a)     the strength of familial support and the degree of supervision provided by the offender’s family for his rehabilitation;

> (b)     the frequency and intensity of the offender’s drug-related activities;

> (c)     the genuineness of remorse demonstrated by the offender; and

> (d)     the presence of risk factors such as negative peers or bad habits.

31     With these sentencing considerations in mind, I now turn to the factual matrix of the case.

## Evaluation and reasons for decision

#### Strength of familial support

32     The accused shares a close relationship with his family members as well as extended relatives and communicated well with them. His younger brother who studies overseas, also communicates regularly with him via social media, text message and calls. Since his arrest in July 2019, his mother has moved back from overseas permanently to closely monitor the accused to ensure that he does not revert to his drug activities. His father has since relocated back to Singapore in January 2020 to also closely supervise the accused. More pertinently, the accused is amenable to his parents’ supervision and receptive towards their discipline. Their supervision appear to be effective as the accused has since his arrest, ceased his drug activities, late nights, and association with his negative peers where he had heeded their advice to cease contact with them and had even changed his mobile phone number in order to do so.

33     The parents’ commitment can also be seen in their taking steps after the accused’s arrest, to address the underlying root causes of his offending behaviour, by ensuring that he undergoes psychotherapy on a weekly basis. Dr Robers’ assessment was that the accused ‘was more vulnerable to influence and impulsiveness over the past year, especially as he was separated from his parents who are stationed overseas’. Given that both parents have relocated back to Singapore to closely monitor the accused as seen above (for example, in routinely checking his handphone, electronic mail account and his room[^15]), this would go some way in ensuring that the accused does not relapse to his drug-taking habit or re-offend.

34     The accused’s familial support is not limited to his immediate family, namely, his parents. His maternal aunts have also been supportive, in that they have stepped in to stay with the accused whenever his parents were away. In this regard, I am confident that with the strong support from his family together with his church community, whom, he has had regular contact with, on a weekly basis, would assist the accused in achieving the goals necessary for his effective rehabilitation.

#### Frequency and intensity of the offender’s drug-related activities

35     I am mindful that the accused’s drug history started when he was first introduced to cannabis at the age of 12 years old. It would appear that he had consumed it out of curiosity when he was given the cannabis by an older 17- year old schoolmate, 5 years his senior. Thereafter, he consumed Ecstasy once in 2017[^16] during an overseas trip and on another occasion in the same year, he consumed cannabis[^17]. In 2018, he had consulted Dr Ung and was under treatment for GAD, ADHD as well as possible PTSD (due to past episodes of psychological trauma of being bullied as a child and in school, witnessing violence in 2011 in Cairo and eventually being evacuated)[^18]. During this time, he had been taking medication for his insomnia as prescribed by Dr Ung. Subsequently, he started abusing cannabis in January 2019 when he was told by his friends that it would help with his insomnia. Whilst I note that the accused was consuming drugs for about seven months until his arrest in July 2019, he was not addicted to cannabis as reported by Dr Winslow and Dr Robers respectively. Furthermore, his parents were unaware of his drug consumption at the material time, as there did not appear to be any withdrawal symptoms reported by the accused or his family then. He has been able to abstain from consuming any illicit drugs since his arrest and the urine tests conducted by Dr Winslow’s clinic post-arrest were negative for any illicit drugs or substances, suggesting that the accused did not have a relapse.

36     I am cognisant of the accused’s multiple drug offences, which may arguably suggest that there is greater culpability on the part of the accused. However, I am also mindful that for other young offenders facing more drug charges, probation was granted. In _Leon Russel Francis_, the offender had a longer history of at least ten months (if not more) of drug-related activities. Further, in the case of _PP v Ng Stephanie Tin_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGDC 274</span> (“_Stephanie Tin_”), which involved a 17-year old offender who pleaded guilty to two charges of drug trafficking, of which six other drug-related charges were TIC for sentencing, three of which involved further counts of drug trafficking or possession for the purposes of trafficking. At the time she was sentenced, the offender was already serving a term at the drug rehabilitation centre. Despite being previously placed on probation for an offence under the Intoxicating Substances Act (Cap 146A, 2001 Rev Ed), dabbling in hard drugs and facing more charges than the present accused, probation was nevertheless granted. Similarly, for the case of _Justin Heng_, who was 20 years old, and pleaded guilty to significantly more charges[^19] than the present case and also sentenced to probation.

37     The accused has not re-offended since his arrest and has ceased all drug-related activities. In both the RT and probation reports, the accused did not exhibit any deep-seated criminal traits that would hinder his successful rehabilitation, nor did he commit a litany of offences while out on bail (see _Leon Russel Francis_ at \[20\]). As similarly noted by Chong JA in _Praveen’s_ case at \[54\], I am also of the view that the present case can thus be distinguished from the case of _Adith[^20]_ where the offender re-offended while on bail.

#### Genuineness of remorse demonstrated by the offender

38     The accused had fully co-operated with the authorities through his admissions of his drug activities and the extent of the same. He had also pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity thus saving time and costs for all parties.

39     I found his sincere remorse to be evident in his candour during police investigations and pre-sentence interviews with the different officers. It was pointed out by the prosecution of the inconsistent accounts that were purportedly given by the accused, to Ms How and Ms Tang in preparing the probation and RT reports respectively, regarding the period he was trafficking in drugs. However, I did not think, that it was an attempt by the accused to minimise his responsibility and I accept counsel’s explanation that it was a genuine mistake by the accused when he informed Ms Tang of the date (or period) that he started trafficking in drugs. In any event, the accused was prepared to accept that he was selling drugs from January 2019 to the date of his arrest and be fully accountable for it.

40     He had also reported to the PO that he was previously given a police warning for stealing two bottles of alcohol sometime in 2014. However, the IO had reported that there were no such records[^21]. I found this to be heartening that the accused was prepared to disclose all his past transgressions (even when the prosecution was unable to verify the same), clearly evincing his honesty. He was also prepared to disclose in fairly substantial detail of his drug activities to the PO. To that end, I am of the view that credit ought to be given to the accused for his candour.

41     Pertinently, was the accused’s expression of regret in his sincere letter to the court, where he realised the foolishness of his past choices and had put his ‘future on the line’ for ‘momentary fun’. On hindsight, he now understands the gravity of the offences he had committed after the CNB officer had explained to him the nefarious activities of crime syndicates, which control the narcotic sales. He is ever determined to turn his life round now having seen the hurt and anguish that he had caused his parents, despite all the sacrifices that they have made for him, which he had clearly taken for granted in the past. He wholly promises not to disappoint them in future.

#### The presence of risk factors

42     As for the presence of risk factors, the accused did not appear to have any unhealthy habits. He has since curbed his late nights and ceased all contact with his negative peers. He has also been tested negative for drugs for all random urine testing and ceased all drug-related activities. As for his alcohol use, the accused reported that he started consuming beer once a week in 2014, and had increased his alcohol in-take to two to three times a week in 2015, whereupon he stopped consuming alcohol from 2015 to 2017 when he was residing in a boarding school in Malaysia. Thereafter, he resumed in May 2017, drinking four to five times a week where he would get drunk one to two times a week. In 2018, he was often intoxicated once every fortnightly when he patronised entertainment outlets. However, since his arrest, he has ceased his alcohol intake and stopped patronising entertainment outlets (where he used to consume copious amounts of alcohol previously). Additionally, he has also stopped his smoking habit as well since October 2019[^22].

## Conclusion

43     As similarly noted by the court in _Justin Heng_ at \[26\], I did not see how a rehabilitative approach for suitable young offenders would trivialise these offences in any way. Very much would depend on the individual circumstances of each case where the offender’s capacity for rehabilitation would have to be demonstrably high. Since his arrest, the accused has clearly taken active steps to make drastic changes to his lifestyle, namely, in curbing late nights, his drinking and smoking habits and most importantly, in ceasing his drug activities. He has also abided by his trial time restrictions imposed by the PO and found to be at home during random checks done. His acknowledgement of his past wrongdoing demonstrates a willingness and determination to change, and not re-offend. The testimonials from his NS superiors, school teachers, psychologist, counsellor/close family friend [^23]\--- attested to his good character, strong work ethic when he was performing his NS duties (which was rated as ‘very good’) and his capacity for reform[^24]. Additionally, he had not exhibited any delinquent traits in school or disciplinary problems during his stint in NS. Both Dr Winslow and Dr Robers have also confirmed the accused’s commitment towards his ‘[^25]recovery and rehabilitation through his regular and active engagement with treatment services[^26]’ as well as his ‘strong resolve to change radically’.

44     The accused had succumbed to the lure of drugs under the negative influence of his friends. However, that has since changed given the strong commitment from his parents in stepping up their supervision as well as the fact that the accused has been amenable to their advice and monitoring. Giving due consideration to his past good conduct in school, the absence of any deep-seated criminal proclivities as well as the reasons stated above in \[34\] to \[41\], I was of the view that the accused’s rehabilitation potential was demonstrably high.

45     Whilst the sentence of ‘reformative training provides the courts with a middle ground that broadly encapsulates the twin principles of rehabilitation and deterrence in relation to young offenders’ (see _PP v Mohamed Al Ansari bin Basri_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR 449</span> (“_Al Ansari_”) at \[58\]), I am of the view that the sentence of reformative training may not be appropriate given his overall prospects of rehabilitation, which point towards cause for optimism rather than pessimism, as highlighted above.

46     The holistic programme as recommended by the PO, coupled with his plans to pursue a Bachelors degree in Psychology at the Singapore Institute of Management (SIM) and to work part-time in his church, would assist in providing a rehabilitative path necessary towards his reform. However, in order to ensure that the accused is able to sustain the positive efforts that he has since made and to minimise the risk of re-offending, I was minded to strengthen the conditions of probation by increasing the period of intensive supervision to 12 months (instead of the 6 months recommended). This included a 12-month period of electronic monitoring (which would restrict his movements and curb his late nights) and for the accused to perform the maximum number of community service hours of 240. Accordingly, the accused was sentenced to probation on the terms as stated in \[3\] above.

47     This would be the last chance afforded to the accused. In the event that he does not cherish this opportunity given to him in reforming himself, by either breaching his probation conditions or re-offending again, the accused ‘could expect to feel the full weight of the law[^27]’ where the accused can be sentenced to the prescribed mandatory sentences of imprisonment and caning.

_The accused was sentenced to 27 months’ split probation (of which 12 months’ intensive and 15 months’ supervised), with the following conditions: to remain indoors daily from 10pm to 6am;to be on electronic monitoring for 12 months; to perform 240 hours of community service; to attend a drug intervention/counselling programme; to undergo regular and random urine tests; to undergo psychiatric and psychological treatment, if necessary; to comply with medication as prescribed by the psychiatrist, if necessary; and the accused’s parents to execute a bond of $5,000 to ensure his good behaviour._

[^19]: The accused had pleaded guilty to three charges relating to possession of a controlled drug, consumption of a specified drug, and possession of drugs for the purpose of trafficking. Five other drug-related charges were taken into consideration for sentencing, three of which involved having other quantities of drugs in his possession for purposes of trafficking.

[^20]: In _Adith’s_ case, the offender, aged 17 years old, pleaded guilty to three counts of drug related offences namely, cultivation of cannabis plants, consumption of a cannabinol derivative) and trafficking of diamorphine was sentenced to probation for a period of 36 months. Four other charges were taken into consideration for purposes of sentencing, namely, two counts of possession of cannabis, one count of possession of utensils for drug-taking and one count of consumption of cannabinol derivative. On appeal by the prosecution, the High Court dismissed the appeal and has observed that reformative training was the more appropriate sentence given the aggravating facts where the accused faced multiple drug offences and had committed some of the offences while on court bail. The prosecution’s appeal against the probation order was dismissed on the ground that the accused had already served a good part of his probation term and had completed his obligations under the community service order, and substituting the probation order with a sentence of reformative training at the time of the appeal, would be unfair to him.
