Criminal Law – Offence – Voluntarily causing grievous hurt

Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Principles

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9273/2021/01.\]

13 December 2021

### District Judge Janet Wang Lan Jee:

## Introduction

1       The accused, a youthful offender, pleaded guilty to one charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt to a fellow prison inmate[^1]. He committed the offence with one Noor Awwalludeen bin Jamil (“Noor Awwalludeen”). At the material time, the accused was 20 years old. I imposed a sentence of an imprisonment term of five years and 12 months, and six strokes of the cane[^2]. The accused had appealed against this sentence. At the point of sentencing, the accused was serving a sentence of reformative training for his prior offences. He is presently undergoing reformative training[^3].

## The Charge

2       The proceeded charge was as set out:

> DAC-919255-2020

> You, are charged that you, on 17 September 2020, at around 8.57 am, in Changi Prison Complex, located at 984 Upper Changi Road North, Singapore, together with Noor Awwalludeen bin Jamil ( a then-19 year old male), in furtherance of the common intention of you both, voluntarily caused hurt to Indarjeet Singh s/o Gopal Singh (then 58 years old), by repeatedly punching, kicking and stamping on his head and upper body, causing him to sustain a severe head injury (including multiple skull and facial fractures) as well as rib fractures and other injuries necessitating hospitalisation till 19 November 2020, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 325 read with Section 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008).

## Statement of Facts

3       The accused admitted to the following facts without qualification:

> 1.    The accused, Muhammad Rahmat Bin Abu Bakar (“Rahmat”), is a 21-year old Singaporean male. He was 20 years old at the time of the offence on 17 September 2020.

> 2.    He committed the offence while he was remanded in Changi Prison Complex at 984 Upper Changi Road North for the preparation of a reformative training suitability report. Just a day before the offence, on 16 September 2020, he had been convicted of drug consumption, moneylending and traffic offences, with a sentencing mention scheduled on 5 October 2020. He had been remanded since 6 July 2019.

> 3.    The co-accused is Noor Awwalludeen bin Jamil (“Noor Awwalludeen”), who was 19 years old then. He was also in remand for the preparation of a reformative training suitability report, after being convicted of drug-related and other offences on 7 September 2020.

> 4.    The two accused persons have each been charged with an offence under s 325 read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) for causing grievous hurt, in furtherance of the common intention of both of them, to another inmate, Indarjeet Singh s/o Gopal Singh (“the victim”), on 17 September 2020 in Changi Prison Complex.

> **Unhappiness between the victim and the accused persons**

> 5.    The two accused persons and the victim were remanded in the same housing unit in prison. The two accused persons were in the same cell, while the victim was in another nearby cell.

> 6.    The victim was displeased with a group of younger inmates (which included the accused persons) for generating too much noise in their cells on some nights. He had approached them to request that they quieten down to no avail. He took to shouting and scolding them from his cell whenever they made noise. Instead of quietening down, the younger inmates made more noise and shouted insults to taunt and mock the victim.

> 7.    Subsequently, the victim wrote an abusive note, addressed to the younger inmates, that insulted the younger inmates as well as their mothers. The note escalated the tension between them. The younger inmates also blamed the victim for the revocation of their prison privileges as they assumed that he had complained to the prison officers about the noise.

> 8.    Sometime in early September 2020, some of the younger inmates (including the accused persons) and the victim agreed to a fight.

> 9.    When the victim failed to show up at least twice and subsequently seemed reluctant to fight, the two accused persons and other younger inmates decided that they would beat up the victim and two of the victim’s cellmates when they had the opportunity to do so.

> **The attack on the victim on 17 September 2020**

> 10.    On the morning of 17 September 2020, the victim and the two accused persons were brought to a waiting room at the medical centre with another inmate for their medical reviews.

> 11.    When Noor Awwalludeen and Rahmat saw the victim, they looked at each other because they knew that was their chance to beat up the victim. Rahmat decided that he would attack the victim and accept the consequences, even if a prison officer intervened.

> 12.    While the victim was speaking with another inmate, Noor Awwalludeen paced arounc the room for around 20 seconds and positioned himself behind the victim. Concurrently, Rahmat stood closer to the door of the waiting room.

> 13.    Sometime around 8.57 am, the two accused persons looked at each other to signal that it was time to attack the victim. Noor Awwalludeen threw a hard punch at the victim’s jaw, attacking the victim from behind so that the victim would not be able to fight back. The victim collapsed after a couple of punches. Rahmat rushed over to join the attack. Both repeatedly punched, kicked and stamped on the victim who was on the ground and defenceless. The victim became unconscious. Most of their punches and kicks were aimed at the victim’s head and upper body.

> 14.    The attack lasted for about 20 seconds before the prisons officers rushed into the room and intervened. The victim was conveyed to Changi General Hospital (“CGH”) for medical attention. The attack was captured by a surveillance camera. The other inmate did not participate or intervene in the attack.

> 15.    After they were sent back to their cells, Rahmat told their cellmates that he and Noor Awwalludeen had “_give already_” to the victim and that the victim “_sleep already_”.

> **Grievous hurt suffered by the victim**

> 16.    The victim’s medical and psychiatric condition since the attack is detailed in the following three medical reports, annexed to the Statement of Facts:

>> (a)    a medical report from the Neurosurgery Department of CGH dated 18 March 2021 (“the Neurosurgery report”) (Annex A);

>> (b)    a medical report from the Department of Surgery of CGH dated 15 April 2021 (“the Department of Surgery report”) (Annex B); and

>> (c)    a report from the Institute of Mental Health dated 16 June 2021, prepared after the victim was examined eight months after the attack in May and June 2021 (“the IMH report”) (Annex C)

> 17.    According to these reports, his condition was as follows:

>> Unconscious and required emergency surgery at time of admission

>> (a)    He was found to have sustained a severe head injury and swelling over his bilateral eyes and epistaxis (acute haemorrhage from the nostril, nasal cavity or nasopharynx). He was unconscious with a Glasgow Coma Score of 7 out of 15 (with 3 being death) and was bleeding from his nostrils and mouth.

>> (b)    The Computed Tomography (CT) scans of his brain and cervical spine performed on the same day showed the following, among others:

>>> i.    acute left frontal extradural haematoma measuring up to 1.1 cm;

>>> ii.    skull vault and multiple bilateral facial fractures; and

>>> iii.   right apical pneumothorax and right upper rib fractures, which were partially imaged

>> (c)    The victim had to undergo emergency surgery; a left decompressive hemicraniectomy and an evacuation of clot and intracranial pressure probe-insertion for the haematoma and haemorrhage.

>> Spent almost a month in intensive care unit until 13 October 2020 and was hospitalised until 19 November 2020 (2 months later)

>> (d)    He was in the Intensive Care Unit for nearly a month until he was transferred to the General Ward on 13 October 2020. There was fluctuation in his consciousness for a period (at least until 29 September 2020 if not later), requiring the doctors to carry out several rounds of testing, including CT and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans.

>> (e)    His injuries had to be managed by neurology surgeons, trauma surgeons, orthopaedic surgeons and plastic surgeons.

>> (f)    He underwent right chest drain insertion on 18 September 2020 and that insertion was removed only on 7 October 2020. As he had prolonged low Glasgow Coma Scale, he underwent open tracheostomy creation on 25 September 2020. The tube was removed only on 22 October 2020. He also underwent open reduction and internal fixation of facial fractures on 5 October 2020.

>> (g)    The victim had to undergo aggressive physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy. Prior to his discharge on 19 November 2020, he was assessed to require moderate-maximum assistance in basic activities of daily living due to severe cognitive impairment. Physiotherapy-wise, he required minimal assist and contact assist by two persons. The psychiatry department diagnosed him with cognitive impairment post-traumatic brain injury.

>> (h)    He was discharged more than two months later, on 19 November 2020, and required follow-up appointments, including the possible need for cranioplasty (surgical repair of a bone defect in the skull). Annex D sets out a photograph of the victim’s head (which has a dent due to the attack) that was taken by the Investigation Officer on 30 November 2020, more than two months after the attack.

>> Condition as at June 2021

>> (i)    As at June 2021 – nine months after the attack, the victim’s condition appears to have improved according to the IMH report. However, IMH does not rule out potential cognitive decline due to his head injury, craniectomy (surgery to remove part of skull to relieve pressure in that area) and history of heroin use.

> **Conclusion**

> 18.    Rahmat committed an offence under s 325 read with s 34 of the Penal Code by acting in furtherance of a common intention with Noor Awwalludeen to voluntarily cause grievous hurt to the victim in Changi Prison Complex by repeatedly punching, kicking and stamping on the victim’s head and upper body, causing him to sustain a severe head injury (including multiple skull and facial fractures) as well as rib fractures and other injuries necessitating hospitalisation until 19 November 2020.

> 19.    On 5 October 2020, Rahmat was sentenced to reformative training (minimum 12 months) for his prior offences, before he turned 21 on 9 October 2020.

> 20.    On 6 August 2021, Noor Awwalludeen was sentenced to a total of 9 years’ and 6 months’ imprisonment and 11 strokes of the cane for the s 325 read with s 34 Penal Code offence and four other offences (drug trafficking, enhanced consumption, failure to report for urine test and providing false information). His sentence for the s 325 read with s 34 Penal Code offence was 4 years’ and 6 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. The District Court’s decision is reported as _Public Prosecutor v Noor Awwalludeen Bin Jamil_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 200</span>.

> 21.    The Prosecution filed a notice of appeal against the sentence for the s 325 read with s 34 Penal Code offence, while the Defence appealed against the sentence as a whole.

## Antecedents

4       The accused had criminal antecedents involving property-related, acts of harassment on behalf of unlicensed moneylenders, traffic and drug offences[^4]. The Prosecution helpfully set out the accused’s antecedent history at \[5(g)\] of the sentencing submissions. The relevant history of his offending is as follows:

5       The accused committed the present offence one day after his conviction on 16 September 2020 for his prior offences. He was due to be sentenced on 5 October 2020, pending a pre-sentencing report on his suitability for reformative training[^5].

## The Sentence

6       The Prosecution sought a sentence in the higher end of the range of seven to ten years’ imprisonment and ten strokes of the cane[^6]. The Defence submitted that a sentence of four years’ and six months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane was appropriate[^7].

7       It is not disputed that rehabilitation does not figure as a dominant sentencing consideration in the present circumstances, being displaced by such considerations as deterrence and retribution. On this note, the Defence acknowledged that while rehabilitation is a relevant sentencing consideration in the sentencing of youthful offenders, this must be balanced against the principles of deterrence and retribution. On such a balance, the Defence sought a sentence of 4 years 6 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane[^8]. It bears mentioning that rehabilitative effects can equally be achieved with a sentence of imprisonment[^9].

8       Central to this appeal is the operation of the parity principle. In determining the sentence, I was fully cognisant of the sentence imposed on the co-offender, Noor Awwalludeen and considered the principle of parity. In this premise, I requested the parties to tender further submissions to address the issue of the application of the parity principle in the present case[^10].

### The parity principle

9       The principle of parity applies when two or more offenders who were party to the same offence were sentenced, the sentences passed should be similar, unless there was a relevant difference in their responsibility or in their personal circumstances – see _PP v Ramlee_ \[1998\] 3 SLR ( R ) 95. This holding was followed in _PP v Ng Sae Kiat and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 167</span>, which was decided by a three-judge bench of the High Court. In _Chong Han Rui v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 25</span>, the Honourable Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon reiterated that the application of the parity principle to the sentences meted out to co-offenders who were party to a common criminal enterprise should not be unduly disparate from each other, namely, those of similar culpability should receive similar sentences, while those of greater culpability should generally be more severely punished[^11]. As further observed by Menon CJ at \[52\] :

> “I emphasise however that _the parity principle is not to be applied in a rigid and inflexible manner_. Rather, it is an important aid to the sentencing court to ensure that sentencing of co-offenders is done in a manner that is broadly consistent and fair. But ultimately, _what is consistent and fair depends on the facts of the case at hand_…”

\[ _emphasis added_\]

10     The Prosecution submitted that the principle of parity did not apply to the present case, and even if it did, it was of limited applicability to the present case[^12]. The Prosecution further argued that where the co-offender’s sentence was unjustifiably low or manifestly inadequate, the parity principle did not apply. The Prosecution maintained its position that the accused’s sentence ought to be higher than that imposed on the co-offender for the same offence, namely, at least seven years’ imprisonment, as Noor Awwalludeen’s sentence was unjustifiably low and incorrect, notwithstanding the parity principle[^13]. The Prosecution reiterated that the discontinuance of its appeal against Noor Awwalludeen’s sentence for the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt ought not to be viewed as an endorsement of the sentence and should not have a bearing on the sentence to be imposed on the accused [^14].

11     The Defence submitted that the parity principle should apply as there were no material differences in the personal circumstances of both the accused and the co-offender, and the responsibility to be borne by each of them for the offence[^15]. It was further submitted that the co-offender’s sentence was not manifestly inadequate[^16]. According to the Defence, a sentence of four years’ and six months’ imprisonment with six strokes of the cane which was imposed on Noor Awwalludeen, was an appropriate sentence adequately reflecting the accused’s culpability[^17].

### Background of co-offender, Noor Awwalludeen

12     It is pertinent to set out the background context involving the case of the co-offender to achieve a fuller appreciation of the application of the parity principle. Noor Awwalludeen was 19 years of age when he committed the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt with the accused. He was a year younger than the accused.

13     At the material time, Noor Awwalludeen was convicted on four charges, namely, one drug trafficking charge, one enhanced drug consumption, one charge of failure to present himself for urine test and one charge of furnishing false information relating to his identity to a police officer, to which he pleaded guilty. He further consented to five other charges to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. These were one charge of possession of utensils intended for consumption of a controlled drug, two charges of failure to present himself for urine test, one charge of voluntarily causing hurt and one charge of fraudulent possession of property. Pre-sentencing reports were called for in the assessment of his suitability for probation and reformative training[^18].

14     While he was kept in custody at Changi Prison Complex awaiting to be sentenced for these offences, Noor Awwalludeen and the accused, further committed the present offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt on a fellow inmate. The co-accused subsequently pleaded guilty to the charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt. The sentencing judge declined to call for a further pre-sentencing report in respect of this offence.

15     Noor Awwalludeen was sentenced to a global sentence of nine years’ and six months’ imprisonment and 11 strokes of the cane. He was sentenced to four years’ and six months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt committed in furtherance of a common intention with the accused.

16     The Prosecution appealed against the sentence imposed on the charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, while the Defence appealed against the sentence in the aggregate. Both appeals were subsequently discontinued prior to this sentencing[^19].

### Application of the parity principle to the BDB framework

17     The prescribed punishment for an offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt under section 325 of the Penal Code, Cap 224, is a mandatory imprisonment term that may extend to 10 years. In addition, caning or a fine may be imposed.

18     The case of the case of _PP v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 127</span> (“_BDB_”) is instructive, where the Court of Appeal set out a two-step sentencing approach involving offences under section 325 of the Penal Code, Cap 224. The first step involves the determination of an indicative starting point based on the seriousness of the injury caused to the victim and should be assessed along a spectrum, taking into consideration the nature and permanence of the injury[^20]. The second step entails an adjustment of the indicative starting point based on an assessment of the offender’s culpability and the presence of relevant aggravating and/or mitigating factors[^21].

19     The Court of Appeal further held that where the grievous hurt caused is death, the indicative starting point should be an imprisonment term of around eight years and 12 or more strokes of the cane. For non-fatal serious injuries including multiple fractures, the indicative starting point should be a term of imprisonment of around three years and six months, and between six and 12 strokes of the cane may be warranted[^22].

20     The Court of Appeal added that the sentencing framework was not meant to be rigidly applied and each case must be assessed based on its own particular facts[^23].

(I)   The indicative starting point

21     The indicative starting points submitted by the Prosecution and the Defence were at variance. According to the Prosecution, the indicative starting point based on the injuries ought to be in the range of five and a half years’ imprisonment to six years’ imprisonment[^24]. The Defence argued that the indicative starting point should be four years and three months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane, in line with the parity principle[^25].

22     The Prosecution relied on the 6th charge of _BDB_ as a yardstick, where the indicative starting point was three years and six months’ imprisonment[^26]. The injuries relating to the 6th charge were fractures to the victim’s left elbow, left calf and his right 8th to 11th ribs. No surgery was required, although the child victim was hospitalised for a period of 3 weeks. The Prosecution argued that the present injuries were far more severe, as the victim’s condition was life-threatening and entailed emergency surgery. The victim remained in intensive care unit for one month and underwent multiple surgeries and required numerous sessions of rehabilitative therapy. According to the Prosecution, a significant uplift from the indicative starting point of three years and six months’ imprisonment (from _BDB_) was warranted.

23     In Noor Awalludeen’s case , the indicative starting point was an imprisonment term of four years and three months and six strokes of the cane. In determining the indicative starting point, the sentencing judge considered the cases of _PP v Azlin bte Arujunah and another_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 168</span> (“_Azlin_”) and _PP v GCW_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 3</span> (“_GCW_”). The cases are set out as follows:

> (a)      _PP v Azlin bte Arujunah and another_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 168</span> – The victim was a five-year old child who was subjected to repeated physical abuse by his parent in the form of scalding and assault with household implements. He succumbed to his burnt injuries. The indicative starting point of four years’ imprisonment was premised on these injuries.

> (b)      _PP v GCW_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 3</span> - The offender hit the victim, his 6-month old biological son once on the head with his right hand as he was annoyed by the latter’s cries in the middle of the night. As a result of the assault, the victim suffered severe head injuries involving multiple comminuted right skull fractures and severe brain atrophy with bleeding of the brain, as well as multiple limb and finger fractures. The victim exhibited a low Glasgow Coma Scale score of 6 out of 15 and required emergency surgery. He was hospitalised for seven months, including a stay in the intensive care unit. Notwithstanding the treatment, the victim suffered permanent physical and intellectual disabilities and needed assistance in all aspects of his daily living owing to the severe brain injuries sustained. The indicative starting point was five years’ and six months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.

24     The Prosecution sought to distinguish these cases which were relied upon by the sentencing judge in Noor Awalludeen’s case. It was the contention of the Prosecution that the injuries in the present case were far more serious than those in _Azlin_ and warranted an uplift of more than three months’ imprisonment[^27]. While the Prosecution conceded that the injuries in _GCW_ were more serious, given the extent and permanency of the victim’s residual disabilities, it was argued that the sentencing judge in Noor Awalludeen’s case had placed undue reliance on _GCW_ in treating the indicative starting point of five years’ and six months’ imprisonment as a relevant guide in the application of the first step of the _BDB_ framework[^28].

25     In support of a sentence of four years and six months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane, the Defence relied on the following post-_BDB_ cases where similar sentences were imposed:

> (i)      _PP v Mollah Hasan and another_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 30</span> (“_Mollah Hasan_”) - This case involved a group assault of 3 persons, including the offender. The group assaulted the victim when he intervened in a quarrel, the duration of which was about five minutes. The victim succumbed to severe neck and spinal cord injuries. The offender committed the offence while he was released on bail and claimed trial to the charge. The indicative starting point was an imprisonment term of eight years and 12 strokes of the cane. The offender was sentenced to four years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. His appeal against sentence was dismissed.

> (ii)      _PP v Ryan Xavier Tay Seet Choong and another_ \[2020\] SGCD 272 (“_Ryan Xavier Tay_”) - The offender claimed trial to an offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt with his step-father, the co-offender. Both offenders had pursued and fought with the victim, before attacking the latter in a relentless manner. The assault lasted approximately 20 minutes. The victim sustained traumatic asphyxia with head injury and multiple facial fractures, which led to his demise. The offender and his family were harassed by the victim for 2 years prior to the incident. The offender was 20 years old at the material time. The indicative starting point was 8 years’ imprisonment. He was sentenced to four years’ imprisonment. The prosecution and defence appealed against this sentence. Both appeals were subsequently withdrawn.

26     The Defence helpfully highlighted the presence of similar aggravating factors in these precedents, namely, a sustained and brutal group attack resulting in severe injuries, and the offence was committed while the offender was released on bail (in _Mollah Hasan_ ). The Defence sought to distinguish the present case, namely, that the joint attack embarked upon by the accused and the co-offender, was less protracted with a duration of about 20 seconds. In addition, there was no evidence of resultant permanent damage from the victim’s injuries[^29].

27     With respect, I did not find the precedents cited by the Defence to be of significant relevance. First, the nature of grievous hurt was vastly different from the present case. The injuries inflicted on the victims in the cited precedents were fatal. Where death had occasioned, the indicating starting point should be an imprisonment term of eight years and at least 12 strokes of the cane, as per the _BDB_ framework. The sentencing judge in each case had accordingly calibrated that indicative starting point downwards, having considered the circumstances specific to the case. In _Mollah Hasan_, the court considered the level of culpability of the accused and found this to be lower than that of his co-accused, who was traced with more antecedents[^30]. In addition, the court noted that there was a disconnect between the offender’s intention to cause harm and the actual harm (of death) caused[^31]. In _Ryan Xavier Tay_, the court considered the fact that the accused and his family were victims of repeated harassment by the deceased prior to the offence to be a strong mitigating factor in adjusting the sentence downwards to an imprisonment term of four years[^32].

28     At the same time, I was not persuaded by the Prosecution’s submission that the indicative starting point ought to be around five and a half years’ to six years’ imprisonment. I noted that the victim’s injuries were more severe than the injuries of the victim in _Azlin_, and required extensive surgical intervention and rehabilitative treatment, as well as prolonged hospitalisation. Having regard to the nature and permanence of the injuries, the severity was of a lesser degree than that of the injuries presented by the victim in _GCW_. In particular, no presence of a neurological deficit was detected at the victim’s last medical examination[^33]. According to the examining doctor, while potential cognitive decline could not be precluded, this would have been due to a confluence of contributory factors, including the victim’s extensive history of heroin abuse, apart from the head injury and craniectomy which resulted from the group assault[^34].

29     In my view, the parity principle applied to the determination of the indicative starting point at the first step of the _BDB_ framework. Having assessed the seriousness of the injuries, including the nature and permanence of these injuries, I determined the appropriate indicative starting point to be four years’ and six months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. Notably, this was not unduly disparate from the indicative starting point of four years’ and three months’ in Noor Awwalludeen’s case.

(II)   Calibration of the indicative starting point

30     Having determined the indicative starting point, I next assessed the level of the accused’s culpability. This involved a holistic assessment of the relevant aggravating and/or mitigating factors.

31     Aggravating factors that were culpability-increasing and common to both the accused and Noor Awwalludeen were, namely, that the offence was premediated and committed brazenly in a public institution where the accused and his co-offender were kept in custody. The group assault on a much older and hence more vulnerable person, the victim being 58 years of age, was relentless and callous. The victim was taken by surprise and was unable to defend himself. The attack continued despite the victim having collapsed. The accused and Noor Awwalludeen had targeted the vulnerable areas, namely, the head and upper body of the victim. After the attack, the accused showed no modicum of remorse, but gloated over the victim’s misfortune in the presence of his cellmates[^35]. Unlike the cases of _Azlin_ and _GCW_ where the actual harm occasioned was neither intended nor anticipated by the offenders, the accused clearly intended to inflict serious injuries on the victim.

32     Pertinently, it would be the offender specific factors, namely, the personal circumstances, where the accused’s case diverged from the co-offender’s. First, the accused was older than Noor Awwalludeen, albeit by a year. Second, the accused’s antecedents were considerable. The accused displayed a marked pattern of criminal conduct. At the material time, the accused was convicted for his prior offences, one day before the present offence. In this regard, the accused had failed to learn and progress from his recent transgressions but had exhibited recalcitrance and a reckless disregard of the law in re-offending shortly after his conviction. Specific deterrence thus warrants an uplift in the sentence to be imposed.

33     Turning to the offences for which the accused was sentenced to reformative training, these involved acts of harassment on behalf of unlicensed moneylenders. Given that the offences involved property damage from the act of splashing indelible red paint, these would ordinarily have warranted an imprisonment of at least 12 months and three strokes of the cane. The accused was spared the punishment of an imprisonment term and caning, as reformative training was imposed in lieu of these sentencing options. Equally relevant is the fact that the accused had committed the offences of drug consumption while he was on bail. The accused’s criminal career started at the age of 13. Rehabilitative prospects were dismal, as demonstrated by his sustained pattern of re-offending which had escalated and culminated in the present offence, and paradoxically, in the very institution that sought to rehabilitate him. It is evident that the accused’s criminal behaviour was marked by defiance of the law and authorities.

34     On the other hand, the co-offender’s antecedent history was less extensive. Noor Awwalludeen had pleaded guilty to the present offence, alongside 4 other prior offences, and consented to 5 other charges to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing (also known as the first set of offences). The interplay of the relevant sentencing principles was thus brought to the fore in determining the appropriate sentence. One of the proceeded charges involved a drug trafficking offence which was punishable with a prescribed mandatory minimum sentence of five years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane. Given the distinct legal interests at stake, the court would have been mindful to order the sentences on at least 2 of the proceeded charges to run consecutively[^36]. In arriving at the aggregate sentence of nine years’ and six months’ imprisonment and 11 strokes of the cane, the application of the totality principle by the court is equally crucial in ensuring that the sentence was not crushing and disproportionately punitive[^37].

35     Equally relevant was the fact that these other offences, namely, the first set of offences to which Noor Awwalludeen pleaded guilty prior to the commission of the present offence, would not have crystallised as prior antecedents which would have the effect of amplifying his culpability as a relevant sentencing consideration, in the same manner that the accused’s previous antecedents for which he was convicted and sentenced to reformative training would. Given the relevant difference in their personal circumstances, the level of culpability of the accused was considerably higher than Noor Awwalludeen’s. Unlike the accused, the sentencing option of reformative training was not available to Noor Awwalludeen.

36     Accordingly, I agreed with the Prosecution that an uplift of between one and a half year to two years’ imprisonment in the second step of the _BDB_ framework was justified[^38]. Having regard to the aggravating factors, an appropriate uplift would have been one year and nine months’ imprisonment. With the uplift, the sentence would be an imprisonment term of five years’ and 15 months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.

37     I next considered the mitigating factors. To his credit, I noted in his favour his youthful age. While the accused had pleaded guilty, there is limited value to be accorded to his plea of guilt as any mitigating effect was blunted by the fact that he was literally caught red-handed in the commission of the offence in the glare of the prison authorities and surveillance cameras. While the victim’s use of a written note to insult the accused and his mother was anything but charitable, the accused’s act of retaliation was wholly disproportionate[^39].

38     Finally, I was fortified in the view that while the sentence must accord with the overall criminality of the accused, it ought not to be crushing. On account of his youth, I was not inclined to increase the number of strokes of caning. Having taken a last look at all the circumstances of the case, I extended a sentencing discount of three months’ imprisonment and adjusted the sentence to one of five years’ and 12 months’ imprisonment, and six strokes of the cane.

## Conclusion

39     Having stated my reasons, all that remains is for me to thank the parties for their helpful submissions and the assistance rendered to this Court.
