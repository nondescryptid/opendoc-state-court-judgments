\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9047/2019/01 and MA 9048/2019/01 \]

12 April 2019

### District Judge Eddy Tham Tong Kong:

1       The Accused pleaded guilty before me to two charges, namely:

(a)      DAC 904959/2018:

that you, on 7 July 2017, at about 8.30 pm, at the basketball court next to Block 35 Jalan Rumah Tinggi, Singapore, together with Shaun Yun Wei Chen, Kim Tian Shun Jimness, Michael Yeo, and 1 other unknown male Chinese subject, were a member of an unlawful assembly whose common object was to cause hurt to S Saghilan and Tay Zhi Sheng Donovan, and in the prosecution of the said common object, one or more of you used violence by punching and kicking S Saghilan and punching Tay Zhi Sheng Donovan, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 147 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224\[; and\]

(b)      DAC 904962/2018:

are charged that you, on the 5th day of November 2016, at about 7.30 p.m., at Popular Book Store, Tiong Bahru Plaza, 302 Tiong Bahru Road, #03-115, Singapore, a building used for custody of property, did commit theft of one black “Onkyo E600M” in-ear headphones with a value of SGD109.00 in the possession of the duty store supervisor, Liu Xiaoping, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 380 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

2       One charge for behaving in a riotous manner committed on 10 August 2017, an offence under section 20 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act, Chapter 184, was taken into consideration.

3       I sentenced the Accused to 12 months of reformative training.

4       The Accused committed the above 3 offences whilst he was on probation which was earlier ordered by District Judge Kenneth Choo. However, as the District Judge has since been transferred to be an Assistant Registrar of the Supreme Court, breach action was taken before me after I had dealt with the Accused on the present offences.

5       The Accused had earlier pleaded guilty to an offence of housebreaking to commit theft by night with common intention under section 457 Penal Code read with section 34 of Penal Code, Chapter 224 (“Penal Code”), with one similar charge taken into consideration. He was placed on 24 months’ probation from 7 April 2016 to 6 April 2018 with a progress accountability court review session carried out on 4 July 2016.

6       For consistency, I had sentenced the Accused on the breach of probation matter similarly to 12 months of reformative training after revoking the order of probation.

7       The Accused being dissatisfied with both sentences has filed an appeal against them. He is released on bail pending the hearing of the appeal.

8       I now set out my grounds of decision for the sentences.

#### The Statement of Facts

9       The following has been admitted by the Accused without any qualification. The Accused is Wee Jai Lun, a 19-year old male Singaporean.

#### Facts relating to the 1st charge DAC 904959/2018

10     This incident involves two groups of people:

Group 1 comprising the Accused, who was 18 years old at the material time, and his friends, namely:

B1:       Shaun Yun Wei Chen, male, 15 years old at the material time;

B2:       Kim Tian Shun Jimness, male, 16 years old at the material time;

B3:       Michael Yeo, male, 15 years old at the material time; and

Group 2 comprising 3 friends, namely

A1:       S Saghilan, male, 17 years old at the material time;

A2:       Tay Zhi Sheng, Donovan, male, 17 years old at the material time; and

A3:       Jonathan Gregory Clyde, male, 26 years old at the material time.

11     Investigations revealed that about one week prior to 7 July 2017, one “Evan”, a friend of Group 1, had been involved in a staring incident with A2 and a few of his friends at Vivocity’s boardwalk. There was a physical confrontation between “Evan” and A2. “Evan” then called B1, B2, and B3 down for help, while A2 called A1 and a few other friends down as well. No further fight broke out, and the two groups parted.

12     Subsequently, on 7 July 2017, A1 and B3 spoke on the phone regarding the Vivocity incident. A1, with the concurrence of A2, agreed with B3 that they would meet to settle the dispute, at the basketball court next to Block 35 Jalan Rumah Tinggi that evening at about 7.30pm. It was agreed that each side would come as a group of about 3 people. A2 then called A3, informed him about the situation, and asked A3 to come along. A3 agreed. B3 had also agreed with B1, B2, and the Accused for them to come along for the settlement.

13     A little before 7.30pm, B2, B3 and the Accused reached the basketball court first. They played basketball together with a few other boys whom they did not know personally, while waiting for the others to arrive. At about 8pm, B3 contacted A1, who said that he was arriving soon. B3 then called B1 to update him of this, and B1 arrived shortly after. At some point in time, B2, B3 and the Accused stopped playing basketball, and together with some of the other members of the public who had been playing with them, joined B1 to sit at a wooden hut nearby.

14     At about 8.30pm, the members of Group 2, led by A1, arrived at the basketball court. B2 then led the other members of Group 1 towards Group 2, together with some of the other boys who had been playing basketball with them, including a male Chinese subject. B1, the Accused and one other member of the group, were holding on to extendable batons at this point in time.

15     After a short exchange of words between B2 and A1, a fight broke out. It started with B1 punching A1 on the face and B2 kicking A1 on the stomach, causing A1 to fall down. Multiple members of Group 1, along with the unknown male Chinese subject, then assaulted A1 and A2. The assault included, but was not limited to, the following:

(a)     Multiple members of the group punched and kicked A1 repeatedly;

(b)      B1: Besides punching A1 at least once at the opening of the fight, he used his extendable baton to hit A1 on the head and around the mouth. He also picked up a stone slab which he used to hit A1’s head, and dragged A1 towards a nearby wall and hit his head against it;

(c)      B2: He kicked A1 on the lower half of his body at the opening of the fight, causing him to fall;

(d)      B3: He punched A2 repeatedly, at least twice;

(e)      The Accused: He was present and armed with an extendable baton as well. He was involved in the assault of A1, but may not have used the baton; and

(f)      The unknown male Chinese subject: He punched A2 four times on the face, causing one of his front left teeth to be chipped.

16     After some time, when the members of Group 1 and the unknown male Chinese subject realised that A1 was bleeding profusely from the head, they stopped the assault, and the parties dispersed.

17     Subsequently, at about 10.25pm the same day, A1, accompanied by his father, sought medical attention at the Sengkang Health Acute Care Clinic at Alexandra Hospital. As he did not want his father to know about the fight, he claimed that a metal tray had fallen onto his head, and he had accidentally bitten his lip.

18     On examination, he was found to suffer from a 7cm laceration over the right side of his scalp, and also a 1cm laceration over his lower lip. He underwent toilet and suturing of his scalp laceration, and was also given an intramuscular tetanus injection. He was then discharged with analgesia and medical leave from 7 July 2017 to 8 July 2017 (2 days), with a polyclinic follow-up date.

19     By virtue of the forgoing, the Accused, together with B1, B2, B3, and an unknown male Chinese subject, was a member of an unlawful assembly which had the common object of causing hurt to A1 and A2, and in the prosecution of that said common object, one or more of them did use violence against A1 and A2. The Accused has thereby committed an offence under Section 147 of the Penal Code.

#### Status of co-accused

20     On 21 September 2017, in the Youth Court, B1 was found to be guilty of an offence under section 147 of the Penal Code, and on 28 November 2017, he was ordered to be sent to a Juvenile Rehabilitation Centre for 24 months.

21     On 22 March 2018, in the Youth Court, B3 was found to be guilty of an offence under section 147 of the Penal Code, and was sentenced to 21 months’ probation with conditions.

#### Facts relating to the 3rd charge DAC 904962/2018

22     The Accused was 17 years old at the material time. B3, who was 14 years old at the material time, was also involved in this incident.

23     The Complainant for this incident is Liu Xiaoping, male, 38 years old, and working as a store supervisor of the Popular book store at Tiong Bahru Plaza at the material time.

24     Investigations revealed that the Accused and B3 were friends who would frequently meet up with each other to play arcade games.

25     On 5 November 2016, they met each other at the Virtualand arcade at Tiong Bahru Plaza, which is at 302 Tiong Bahru Road. There, the Accused informed B3 that he wanted a set of earphones, but did not have money to buy them. The Accused and B3 then agreed to steal a set of earphones each.

26     At about 7.23pm, they entered the Popular bookstore at Tiong Bahru Plaza, #03-115, and went straight to the shelves where the earphones were kept.

27     At about 7.27pm, B3 opened a box of earphones, removed the earphones, and kept them in his pocket, while the Accused kept a lookout. The earphones were Sony MDREX750AP, valued at $139.

28     At 7.30pm, the Accused opened another box of earphones, removed the earphones, and hid them between his shirt and his grey jacket, while B3 kept a lookout. The earphones were Onkyo E600M, valued at $109.

29     Both B3 and the Accused then left the store without making payment.

30     Tiong Bahru Plaza, including the Popular bookstore from which B3 and the Accused stole, is a building used for the custody of property.

31     The Accused took the Onkyo E600M earphones out of the box and out of the store without making payment, with the dishonest intention of making wrongful gain when he knew that he was not entitled to the earphones. He has thus committed an offence under section 380 of the Penal Code.

#### Antecedent records

32     The Accused’s first criminal record was on 27 November 2012 where he was placed on probation and ordered to reside at a juvenile home for a period of 21 months for the following offences:

(a)     2 charges of theft under section 379 of the Penal Code;

(b)     1 charge of theft in dwelling under section 380 of the Penal Code; and

(c)     with 6 charges taken into consideration –

4 charges of theft under section 379 of the Penal Code;

1 charge of theft in dwelling under section 380 of the Penal Code; and

1 charge for doing a rash act which endangered life or personal safety.

33     Thereafter, the Accused was placed under another round of probation on 7 April 2016 for a period of 24 months in respect of housebreaking and theft by night charges mentioned above.

#### Prosecution’s submissions

34     The Prosecution sought for the Accused to be sentenced to reformative training. They pointed out the long table of interventions that had already taken place since 2011 with the Accused being placed under Guidance Programme. Thereafter the Accused had reoffended and was placed on probation. He breached probation and was sent to the Juvenile Rehabilitation Centre until 2015. The Accused again reoffended in 2016, this time committing the offences of housebreaking and theft by night. The Accused thereafter committed the present offences showing a clear pattern of delinquency. The Prosecution thus asked for reformative training on level 2 intensity as recommended in the reformative training suitability report to be imposed.

#### Mitigation

35     The Defence Counsel (“DC”) submitted for the Accused to be placed once again on probation relying on the fact that he was found suitable for probation by the assessing probation officer.

36     The DC argued that the pattern of re-offending had already been noted and identified in the probation report as a risk factor and hence has been taken into account by the Probation Officer in the recommendation for probation.

37     The DC laid emphasis on the fact that the Accused had remained crime free since Aug 2017 and that enlistment into National Service has brought about positive changes in his life. The DC pointed out to the fact that he has now the presence of pro-social peers as well as the good influence of his platoon commander who is a good role model for him. The DC also set out the testimonials of his platoon commanders stating amongst other things that the Accused “has a commendable level of mental fortitude and is willing to learn and change for the better”. Sentencing him to reformative training will thus be detrimental to the good progress he has shown and other positive influences already operating on his life.

#### Principle of Sentencing

38     This is a case where an Accused has re-offended during probation. The High Court, in dealing with such a case in _Public Prosecutor v Koh Wen Jie Boaz_ (“_Boaz Koh_”) which involved an accused who had committed an act of vandalism during the period of probation, set out the following principles \[56-57\]:

(a)     the Court should still first embark on the two-stage inquiry which is firstly, whether rehabilitation still retains its primacy and secondly, if so, whether probation or reformative training is the most appropriate sentence;

(b)     when considering whether or not to order a second sentence of probation, the court should bear in mind the following factors:

(i)       whether the latest offence in question is serious;

(ii)       whether the offender’s pattern of offending, seen as a whole, significantly displaces the focus on rehabilitation or at least mandates that greater emphasis be placed on deterrence within an overarching emphasis on rehabilitation. To put it another way, the question is whether the youthful offender’s offending pattern justifies optimism or forebodes an “escalation” from the offender’s previous offences;

(iii)       whether there is evidence of genuine remorse and a genuine commitment to repent and turn over a new leaf;

(iv)       whether there is cause for assurance that the risk factors which caused the last attempt at probation to fail have been effectively addressed; and

(v)       whether there are any countervailing considerations such as the public interest in prevention or deterrence that militate against a fresh order of probation.

39     Applying these principles to the present case, I found that the rehabilitation is still a relevant consideration. The nature of the offences is not so serious as to rule out rehabilitation as the primary sentencing principle. For the rioting offence, the Accused was not the main culprit who initiated the assault but had gone along to help his friend. The other proceeded charge involved an offence of theft.

40     However, applying the rest of the factors, I found that on balance, they point towards reformative training as the more appropriate sentence compared with a second round of probation.

41     Firstly, there was clearly an escalation in the offending behaviour. In the first set of offences committed by the Accused, those were mainly property offences with 8 theft offences and one rash act offence. The Accused then re-offended with another set of property related offences, but of a more serious kind – 2 counts of housebreaking and theft by night offences.

42     The Accused then escalated his offending behaviour by committing a violence-related offence of rioting where serious hurt was caused together with yet another property-related offence of theft. This time, his offending behaviour together with others, has caused physical hurt to another. Weapons were used in the attack and the Accused was armed with a baton as well although he did not use it. One of the victims was bleeding profusely from a vulnerable part of the body, namely the head, which required suturing a 7cm laceration on the scalp.

43     For the charge taken into consideration, it is also noted that the Accused shortly after the rioting offence of 7 July 2017, went on to commit another act of violent behaviour, on 10 August 2017. The charge of riotous behaviour stated that the Accused had at about 12.50 am, at Holland Village Market & Food Centre, held a metal pole and shouted loudly at one Mou Zhan Yu, male aged 30 years old, and challenged him to a fight repeatedly.

#### Past interventions failed to have a lasting effect

44     The Accused had therefore not only committed a much more serious offence in his latest offending behaviour but had done so despite numerous opportunities given to him to turn over a new leaf.

45     The details of past interventions have been set out at paragraph 4.2 of his Probation Report. These are as follows:

First intervention – Guidance Programme

(a)     The first intervention came at the age of 13 when he was placed under Guidance Programme in 2011. Although he completed it, the Accused re-offended shortly with another theft offence after completing the Programme.

Second intervention – 1st round of probation

(b)     He was next placed on 21 months’ probation from 27 November 2012 with a 12-month hostel stay at Gravehaven. His overall progress was poor as evidenced by:

(i)       2 verbal warnings as he committed theft in Gracehaven on 14 December 2012 and absconded from Gracehaven for one day on 1 January 2013;

(ii)       breach action initiated for absconding from Gracehaven 2 more times on 21 January and on 30 January 2013. Probation amended for the Accused to reside in the Singapore Boys’ Hostel (“SBH”);

(iii)       breach action initiated again on 18 April 2013 after the Accused failed to return to SBH for more than 7 days and a Warrant of Arrest was issued; and

(iv)       probation was revoked and he was ordered to reside in SBH for 24 months pursuant to a Juvenile Rehabilitation Centre (“JRC”) Order from 4 June 2013 to 3 June 2015. His overall progress on the JRC Order was rated as poor due to disciplinary issues such as frequent smuggling of prohibited items, defiance shown towards staff and self-harm behaviour.

Third Intervention – 2nd round of probation

(c)     Shortly after the completion of his JRC Order on 3 June 2015, the Accused re-offended again with housebreaking and theft by night offences and was placed under 2nd round of probation for 24 months from 7 April 2016 to 6 April 2018. He did not show much improvement on this second round of probation and his overall progress was rated as inconsistent. His breaches were as follows:

(i)       verbal warning issued on 19 May 2016 as he was late for school on 7 occasions and caught smoking on 19 May 2016 (note: this was just shortly one month into his second round of probation);

(ii)       2nd verbal warning issued on 18 July 2016 as he played truant on 7 July 2016, was caught smoking and creating public nuisance at a HDB block on 11 July 2016;

(iii)       written warning issued on 26 January 2017 as he failed to perform community service on 8 occasions without valid reason;

(iv)       involved in a case of affray on 7 November 2016 and received a stern warning by the police on 18 August 2017;

(v)       Current offences:

·       theft on 5 November 2016 (DAC 904962/2018);

·       rioting on 7 July 2017 (DAC 904959/2018); and

·       behaving in riotous manner on 10 August 2017, (MAC 904121/2018 – the charge taken into consideration).

46     The Accused had clearly demonstrated a very poor track record based on his past performances under rehabilitative programmes. In summary, the current offences were committed whilst he was on his second round of probation on top of an earlier Guidance Programme. He had shown such blatant disregard – almost to a point of contempt – for the many chances given to him. He kept committing breaches one after another during the periods of interventions. All the warnings issued to him appear to have fallen on deaf ears. In the words of the probation officer set out at page 2 of the Probation Report under “Risk Factors”:

“Jai Lun’s repeated offending despite past interventions indicated his blatant disregard for the law and authorities, failure to internalise the lessons learnt and lack of resolve to lead a pro-social life”.

#### Evidence of genuine remorse

47     Since the commission of the latest offence in August 2017, the Accused has been crime free as noted by the probation officer. However, other than this fact and his plea of guilt, I did not observe any other evidence of genuine remorse on the part of the Accused. There is no record of any offer of apology or voluntary compensation made by the Accused.

48     The fact that he had managed to remain crime-free since August 2017 could also be attributed to the fact that he has been enlisted into National Service since 9 November 2017. This brings me to the next factor on whether the risk factors which caused the last attempt at probation to fail have been effectively addressed.

#### Whether there is cause for assurance that the risk factors which caused the last attempt at probation to fail have been effectively addressed

49     The Defence Counsel essentially latched on to the fact that the Probation Officer has assessed that the Accused is still suitable for probation. The Probation Officer in coming to her recommendation listed four “Strengths/Protective factors” at page 2 of the Probation Report:

(a)     The Accused has remained crime free since August 2017. His good progress in National Service (NS) suggested that he is capable of leading a disciplined and structured lifestyle;

(b)     His NS enlistment provided an avenue for him to expand his network of positive peers, allowing him to meet his need for peer-relatedness in a pro-social manner;

(c)     His motivation to remain crime free and goals set can be leveraged on to ensure that he is directed in life; and

(d)     His father has remained concerned and supportive of him.

50     I found the first two factors given in relation to the positive effect of NS insufficient grounds to tilt the balance in favour of probation. Clearly NS is meant to instil a high level of discipline in all enlistees. It would thus not be surprising that the regimented lifestyle with strict rules and physical training with fellow trainees would result in some positive effect generally. The NS regiment would also brook no nonsense and would mete out punishment for breach of rules. I am therefore not impressed by the fact that there has been a cessation of criminal conduct during this period of time.

51     While it is encouraging that the Accused claims he is now more motivated to remain crime free with positive influence from his superiors and pro-social peers, this does not change the fact that the Accused had flagrantly flouted his conditions of probation again and again with impunity. To allow the positive effect of NS to substitute what would be the appropriate sentence would be to send the wrong message that one can blatantly ignore the consequences of blatant breaching of probation so long as one suddenly bucks up during NS.

52     The remaining factor of the support by his father has to be seen against the background that the father was stated to be supportive of him throughout all the previous probation periods but this alone did not stem the tide of the Accused’s habitual re-offending.

#### Conclusion

53     Hence, considering all the factors, I found that clearly a more deterrent approach under the overarching umbrella of rehabilitation is warranted in the present case. The Reformative Training Report has recommended for the Accused to undergo Level 2 intensity of rehabilitation which would require interventions to be delivered over a 12-month period. Accordingly, I have imposed a sentence of reformative training for a minimum period of 12 months’ detention.

54     Whilst this sentence would inevitably interrupt his NS, there is no reason why the Accused cannot resume and continue with the positive journey he has started upon completion of his reformative training.
