Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Appeals

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9010/2022/01.\]

26 January 2022

### Senior District Judge Bala Reddy:

1       The accused, Merina Ng Su Yi (the “Accused”), pleaded guilty to one charge of cheating and thereby dishonestly inducing delivery of property under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”) and one charge of attempting to cheat under s 420 read with s 511(1) of the Penal Code. The salient parts of the charges are reproduced below:

> **DAC-908870-2021 (“cheating offence”)**

> \[Y\]ou, on 30 April 2021, at about 11.53a.m., at Chanel, #B1-133 of The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, 10 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore, did cheat Chanel, to wit, you deceived Chanel into believing that you were authorised to use the Standard Chartered credit card bearing number XXX in the name of one Hong Riwei Patrick, and by such manner of deception, you dishonestly induced Chanel to deliver a handbag valued at $11,210 to you, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> **DAC-910773-2021 (“attempted cheating offence”)**

> \[Y\]ou, on 30 April 2021, at or about 12.49pm, at Apple, # B2-06 of The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, 2 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore (“Apple”), did attempt to cheat Apple, and in such attempt did an act towards the commission of the offence, to wit, by presenting to Apple one POSB credit card bearing number XXX, in the name of one Hong Riwei Patrick, and thereby deceiving Apple into believing that you were authorised to use the said card, and by such manner of deception, you did attempt to dishonestly induce Apple to deliver an iPhone 12 Pro Max valued at $2,168 to you, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 420 read with s 511(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

2       The Accused consented to have two charges taken into consideration – one similar charge of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code and one charge of dishonest misappropriation under s 403 of the Penal Code.

3       I convicted the Accused and sentenced her to seven months’ imprisonment for the cheating offence (DAC-908870-2021) and one month’s imprisonment for the attempted cheating offence (DAC-910773-2021). I ordered the sentences to run consecutively, with a resulting global sentence of eight months’ imprisonment.

4       Being dissatisfied with my decision, the Accused has filed an appeal against sentence. I now set out the reasons for my decision.

## Facts

5       The Accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification. Accordingly, the Accused was convicted on the two proceeded charges. The salient facts are as follows:

> (a)     On 30 April 2021, at about 1.35pm, the complainant, Hong Riwei Patrick, filed a police report at Orchard Neighbourhood Police Centre, stating that he had received an SMS from Standard Chartered bank stating that his Standard Chartered card ending with “1933” was charged for a transaction of $11,210 at a Chanel boutique at Marina Bay Sands, Singapore. It was at this juncture that the complainant realised that he had misplaced his wallet. After he received the SMS, the complainant called Standard Chartered bank, and was told by the customer service hotline to lodge a police report.

> (b)     Sometime between 27 and 29 April 2021, the Accused was at Carlton Hotel, Singapore, for a dinner gathering with her friends, when she came across an orange paper bag at the lobby. The Accused opened the paper bag and saw, amongst other things, a wallet containing several credit cards. This paper bag and its contents belonged to the complainant. The Accused then decided to take the paper bag home with her.[^1]

> _Facts Pertaining to DAC-908870-2021_

> (c)     The witness is Liu Xiaolan, a 32-year-old Chinese national. At the material time, the witness was working as a Fashion Advisor at the Chanel boutique at The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, #B1-133, 10 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore.

> (d)     On the morning of 30 April 2021, the Accused arrived at The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, with two of the complainant’s credit cards she had taken with her. These were the Standard Chartered credit card bearing the number XXX (the “**Standard Chartered card**”), and the POSB credit card bearing the number XXX (the “**POSB card**”).

> (e)     At about 11.53am, the Accused entered the Chanel boutique, where she was served by the witness. After a few minutes of browsing, the Accused indicated to the witness her intention to purchase a black Chanel handbag that was valued at $11,210. The witness proceeded to obtain a new handbag of the same model from the storeroom for the Accused.

> (f)     At the payment counter, the Accused then produced the complainant’s Standard Chartered card, intending to use it to make payment. The witness saw that the name of the cardholder was male and asked the Accused if that was her name. The Accused replied that her father had let her use the card to buy herself a birthday gift. The Accused, however, knew this fact to be false.

> (g)     Therefore, the Accused had cheated Chanel; to wit, she had deceived Chanel into believing that she was authorised to use the Standard Chartered card, and by such manner of deception, she dishonestly induced Chanel into delivering to her the handbag. The Accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“**Penal Code**”).

> _Facts Pertaining to DAC-910773-2021_

> (h)     After the events above, the Accused entered the Apple store at Marina Bay Sands, located at #B2-06, 2 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore, intending to use the complainant’s credit cards to buy herself a new iPhone 12 Pro Max.

> (i)     After a few minutes of browsing, the Accused told the staff at the Apple store that she wanted to purchase an iPhone 12 Pro Max valued at $2,168, upon which the staff then retrieved an unopened box containing the said mobile phone model for her.

> (j)     At the payment counter, the Accused then attempted to cheat Apple, and in such attempt did an act towards the commission of the offence; to wit, the Accused produced the complainant’s Standard Chartered card, intending to use it to make payment for the iPhone using the PayWave function of the card.

> (k)     After the Accused tapped the complainant’s Standard Chartered against the payment terminal, the transaction was declined. At this juncture, the Accused then produced the complainant’s POSB card and tapped it against the payment terminal. However, the transaction was again declined. The Accused then informed the Apple staff that she did not intend to purchase the iPhone anymore, and left the store.

> (l)     By virtue of the foregoing, the Accused had deceived Apple into believing that she was authorised to use the POSB card, and by such manner of deception, she attempted to dishonestly induce Apple to deliver the iPhone 12 Pro Max to her. The Accused has thus committed an offence under s 420 read with s 511(1) of the Penal Code.

## Antecedents

6       The Accused is untraced.

## Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

7       The Prosecution sought a sentence of 8 to 9 months’ imprisonment for the cheating offence, and a sentence of 1 to 2 months’ imprisonment for the attempted cheating offence. The Prosecution submitted that the sentences should run consecutively – i.e. global sentence of 9 to 11 months’ imprisonment.

8       In support of its sentencing position, the Prosecution cited the decision of _Idya Nurhazlyn bte Ahmad Khir v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 1 SLR 756</span>; <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGHC 238</span> (“_Idya Nurhazlyn”_) at \[47\] to \[48\] where Menon CJ held that a custodial sentence is generally appropriate as long as the offence causes a victim to part with property that has more than negligible value. The learned CJ further stated that the primary yardstick will often be the value of property involved. He also observed that custodial sentences of four to eight months’ imprisonment are typically imposed for s 417 Penal Code offences involving sums between $1,000 and $15,000.

9       The Prosecution also cited the decision of _Public Prosecutor v Fernando Payagala Waduge Malitha Kumar_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 334</span>; <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGHC 23</span> (“_Fernando Payagala”_) where V K Rajah J held that cheating offences involving the use of credit cards or other financial instruments threaten to undermine the reliability of credit cards as a mode of payment, and the entire security of our credit infrastructure. A severe stance must be adopted to check the abuse of credit cards, and deterrence should be of equal, if not greater, concern when dealing with such offences.

10     V K Rajah J in _Fernando Payagala_ highlighted that the following factors are relevant in determining the appropriate sentence: (i) the degree of planning and premeditation, (ii) the sophistication of the offence and measures taken to avoid detection, (iii) the role of the accused, (iv) the number of offences and quantum involved, (v) the extent of actual loss, damage, and adverse consequences to victims and connected parties, (vi) the international dimension, and (vii) any remorse shown by the accused. V K Rajah J observed that the starting point of sentencing tariffs for non-syndicated stolen or misappropriated credit card offences is 12 to 18 months’ imprisonment per charge: at \[75\].

11     In the present case, the Prosecution highlighted the following offence-specific factors – applying _Fernando Payagala_:

> (a)     The degree of planning and premeditation is moderate. The Accused found the complainant’s wallet a few days prior to her offending conduct, and brought the complainant’s credit cards out to spend on big-ticket items for her personal benefit.

> (b)     The offences are not sophisticated. No steps were taken by the Accused to conceal her offending conduct.

> (c)     The Accused played an active role in the offences, as the sole perpetrator.

> (d)     The actual loss to the complainant is $11,354, which is a fairly large sum. However, the Prosecution noted that full restitution had been made to the complainant.

> (e)     There are two proceeded cheating offences. The attempted cheating offence is egregious as it demonstrated that the Accused became emboldened in her dishonest conduct after she realised that the complainant’s cards could successfully be used to purchase big ticket items.

12     The Prosecution also highlighted the following aggravating and mitigating factors:

> (a)     There is one TIC charge for the same offence under s 420 of the Penal Code for the purchase of a bottle of Chanel perfume for $144.

> (b)     The offences were committed within a short span of time, and the value of the items purchased by the Accused is indicative of her opportunistic greed to make full use of the complainant’s card to fund her personal shopping expenses.

> (c)     The fact that the Accused is untraced is at best a neutral factor and not a mitigating factor.

13     The Prosecution cited sentencing precedents for s 420 Penal Code offences which illustrate that sentences between 6 to 15 months’ imprisonment have been imposed: _Fernando Payagala; Public Prosecutor v Prakash s/o Mathivanan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 284</span> (_“Prakash s/o Mathivanan”_); and _Nurmadinah binte Noor Kim v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGDC 331</span> (_“Nurmadinah”_).

14     The Prosecution submitted that the sentences for both proceeded charges should run consecutively as they do not form part of a single transaction and are distinct offences arising out of separate incidents of offending.

## Mitigation and Defence’s Address on Sentence

15     The Defence sought a global sentence of six months’ imprisonment. In support of its sentencing position, the Defence cited as sentencing precedents the decisions of _Fernando Payagala, Fadilah bte Omar v Public Prosecutor_ (Magistrate’s Appeal No 168 of 1996) (_“Fadilah bte Omar”_)_, Public Prosecutor v Mihaly Magashazie_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGDC 35</span> (“_Mihaly Magashazie”_) and _Glynis Wong Dwe May v Public Prosecutor_ (Magistrate’s Appeal No 7 of 1999) (“_Glynis Wong Dwe May”)._

16     Applying _Fernando Payagala_, the Defence submitted that the following factors apply in the present case:

> (a)     There was no planning and premeditation. In the instant case, the Accused merely misused the credit cards she found in a bag in the lobby of a hotel and used the cards on the spur of the moment and “in hot blood”.

> (b)     The modus operandi of the Accused was relatively unsophisticated and no precautions were taken to avoid detection. She used the cards at the Chanel boutique and Apple store on the same day without sophistication or with any efforts to cover her tracks. The Defence submitted that the length of time the cheating went undetected was relatively short as the Accused used the cards twice and was arrested shortly thereafter. The Defence suggested that the Accused was similar to “a mere opportunist who – after chancing upon unattended wallets left in public places – was momentarily tempted by greed to steal the credit cards and use them”: _Mihaly Magashazie_.

> (c)     The Accused was not part of a syndicate and acted alone.

> (d)     The Accused committed four offences amounting to an aggregate amount of $11,354 which is a relatively small amount.

> (e)     The extent of actual loss, damage and adverse consequences was minimal as the accused made full restitution. This also illustrates the Accused’s remorse.

> (f)     The Accused acted alone and there was no international dimension.

> (g)     Defence highlighted that even though Dr Steve Lee Yin Lam (“Dr Steve”) of the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) concluded that the Accused did not experience dissociation at the time of the offences and is fit to plead in a Court of Law, Dr Steve also noted that the Accused suffered from Major Depressive Disorder since 2018. Accordingly, the Defence urged the Court to take into account this point as a mitigating factor during sentencing.

## Decision on Sentence

#### Prescribed Punishments

17     An offence of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code attracts a sentence of up to 10 years imprisonment and the Accused is also liable to fine. An offence of attempted cheating under s 420 read with s 511(1) of the Penal Code attracts the same sentence as an offence under s 420 Penal Code: see s 512(2) of the Penal Code.

18     Accordingly, both charges attract custodial sentences.

#### Sentencing Principles

19     Where credit card cheating offences are concerned, it is trite that general and specific deterrence are the primary sentencing considerations: _Fernando Payagala_ at \[88\]; _Public Prosecutor v Song Hauming Oskar and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 5 SLR 965</span>; <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 169</span> at \[119\]. As V K Rajah J held in _Fernando Payagala_ at \[88\]:

> Offences involving credit cards inevitably warrant severe treatment, save in exceptional cases. Given the pre-eminence and pervasiveness of credit cards as a preferred mode of payment in day-to-day commerce, such recurrent offences threaten to grievously undermine both its reliability as a mode of payment as well as the entire security of our credit infrastructure. An enormous amount of time, money and effort is unnecessarily expended by financial institutions and authorities in combating such fraud. Such offences, if left unchecked, would be akin to a slow drip of a subtle but potent poison that will inexorably and irremediably damage Singapore’s standing both as a financial hub as well as a preferred centre of commerce. Further, as a key global financial player, Singapore bears international responsibility in ensuring that it does not afford a platform for either the launch or perpetration of this genre of fraud. Financial institutions face a constant and relentless struggle each and every time a security risk posed by a credit card fraudster surfaces. Indeed, the entire credit card holding community bears the brunt, both financial and the incalculable inconvenience, whenever such an offence rears its ugly hydra head. The price of security is unstinting vigilance and the unflinching imposition of appropriately stiff sentences in dealing with transgressions. Offenders must expect to face harsh custodial sentences; general deterrence is a vital if not paramount consideration in assessing how severe the sentence should be in any given case.

#### Offence-Specific Factors

20     I considered the offence-specific factors highlighted in _Fernando Payagala_ at \[73\]: (a) degree of planning and premeditation; (b) sophistication of offence and measures taken to avoid detection; (c) role of the accused; (d) number of offences and quantum involved; (e) extent of actual loss, damage and adverse consequences to victims and connected parties; (f) international dimension; and (g) remorse shown.

##### (1)   Cheating Offence (DAC-908870-2021)

21     Firstly, I considered the amounts of loss involved, which is the primary yardstick for determining the appropriate sentence for cheating offences: _Idya Nurhazlyn_ at \[48\]. In relation to the cheating offence, the amount cheated was a significant sum of $11,210. Across all charges including the charges taken into consideration, the total amount of loss (potential and actual) involved was $13,522. On the other hand, the Accused has made full restitution.

22     Secondly, I noted that there were only two proceeded charges – a fairly small number of charges. Further, I observed that the offences were not premeditated. Instead, the Accused appeared to have taken advantage of an opportunity which arose when she found the complainant’s wallet containing the credit cards and subsequently committed the offences. Additionally, I was mindful that there was no sophistication involved in the present offences. The Accused was also the sole perpetrator as opposed to being part of a syndicate. Further, there is no international dimension to this case.

##### (2)   Attempted Cheating Offence (DAC-910773-2021)

23     In relation to the attempted cheating offence, the amount involved was a fairly significant sum of $2,168. However, given that this was an _attempted_ cheating offence, I was mindful that the sum of $2,168 only constituted potential loss and not actual loss. Across all charges including the charges taken into consideration, the total amount of loss (potential and actual) involved was $13,522. On the other hand, the Accused has made full restitution.

24     The considerations highlighted at \[22\] of these grounds of decision similarly applied here.

#### Offender-Specific Factors

25     Next, I considered the offender-specific factors in the present case. These factors applied to both offences. Firstly, there were two charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. This included one similar cheating charge under s 420 of the Penal Code where the amount cheated was $144. On the other hand, the Accused was untraced and had pleaded guilty.

26     I address the Defence’s submission that the Court should take into account as a mitigating factor that the Accused suffered from Major Depressive Disorder since 2018 – citing the IMH report prepared by Dr Steve dated 8 October 2021 (“IMH Report”).

27     The mere existence of a psychiatric condition is not mitigating in itself. In _Ng So Kuen Connie v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 3 SLR(R) 178</span> at \[58\], Yong Pung How CJ held that a mental disorder must have had some impact on the offender’s ability to control his actions at the time of the offence before it can effectively reduce the offender’s culpability. There must be a _“causal link between the mental disorder and the commission of the offence.”_

28     In the present case, in the IMH Report, Dr Steve had opined that the Accused suffered from Major Depressive Disorder since around 2018, evidenced by the presence of depressed mood, insomnia, reduced appetite and concentration as well as dissociative episodes, characterised by the Accused’s reports of instances where she felt she was not in control of her action. However, crucially, Dr Steve observed in the same report that the Accused did not experience dissociation at the time of the alleged offences, and was in control of her actions which were clearly driven by her own volition. Dr Steve also opined that the Accused had the knowledge of the wrongfulness of her actions. He further opined that the Accused was not of unsound mind at the material time of the alleged offences, and was fit to plead.

29     Accordingly, I found that the Accused was not of unsound mind at the material time and was fully in control of her actions. In my judgment, the IMH Report did not assist the Defence in showing that the Accused had a mental disorder at the time of the offences which had an impact on the Accused’s ability to control her actions.

#### Sentencing Tariffs and Sentencing Precedents

##### (1)   Cheating Offence (DAC-908870-2021)

30     As established by the High Court in _Fernando Payagala_, the starting point of the sentencing tariffs for s 420 Penal Code credit card cheating offences which are non-syndicated is between 12 to 18 months’ imprisonment per charge: at \[75\]. It bears highlighting at this juncture that _Fernando Payagala_ was decided at a time where the prescribed punishment under s 420 of the Penal Code was up to seven years imprisonment and liability to fine – the prescribed punishment has since been increased. Aggravating and mitigating factors should then be assessed in determining whether the sentence should be enhanced or discounted accordingly: at \[75\]. These include the factors addressed in the earlier parts of these grounds of decision.

31     I considered the sentencing precedents cited by the Prosecution and the Defence. I observed that in the precedents cited, even where the total amounts cheated were relatively low but not insignificant (between $1,200 to $6,000), in circumstances where there were multiple charges and where there was restitution or recovery of property[^2], custodial sentences between six to 12 months imprisonment have been imposed: see _Fernando Payagala, Fadilah bte Omar, Glynis Wong Dwe May_ and _Nurmadinah._

32     I was also mindful that some of the precedents cited involved more aggravating facts:

> (a)     In _Mihaly Magashazie_, the accused pleaded guilty, _inter alia_, to three charges under s 420. 12 other charges of theft, cheating and attempted cheating were taken into consideration. The District Judge held that the offences were premeditated as opposed to being committed on the spur of the moment and “in hot blood.” The total amount cheated was high – $23,105. In total, there were nine counts of cheating and five counts of attempted cheating. The accused was not a first offender for property offences. A sentence of one year’s imprisonment was imposed in respect of each of the s 420 charges, with two of the sentences running consecutively. The appeal against sentence by the accused was dismissed.

> (b)     In _Prakash s/o Mathivanan_, the accused pleaded guilty inter alia to _six_ proceeded cheating offences which involved credit cards. _54_ charges were taken into consideration, illustrating the high culpability of the accused. There was a premeditated scheme involving a group of three offenders who schemed to make purchases with credit card information belonging to a third party and thereafter selling the goods for cash. The total amount of losses caused were far higher than the present case, in the sum of $47,707. No restitution was made. The cheating offences were committed whilst the accused had jumped court bail. The accused was traced, albeit for unrelated antecedents. The accused was sentenced between 6 to 15 months’ imprisonment per charge. For the charges involving losses of $6,184 and $6,132, the accused was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment per charge.

33     In all, I considered that a sentence of seven months’ imprisonment was fair for the cheating offence.

##### (2)   Attempted Cheating Offence (DAC-910773-2021)

34     No precedents involving attempted cheating offences were put before me. Nevertheless, I considered that the sentencing tariffs and precedents involving cheating offences were useful in determining the sentence to be imposed. Accordingly, I applied similar considerations highlighted earlier. However, bearing in mind that no actual loss was caused, I considered that a sentence of one month imprisonment would be adequate and appropriate for the attempted cheating offence.

#### Global Sentence

35     In ascertaining the global sentence to be imposed, I was mindful that the global sentence should be proportionate to the overall criminality of the Accused and should not be crushing. Whilst the proceeded charges formed part of a single transaction, I considered that the sentences for the proceeded charges should run _consecutively_ so as to properly reflect the Accused’s overall criminality. I further considered that the resulting global sentence of eight months’ imprisonment was not crushing.

## Conclusion

36     In the result, I imposed the following sentences:

> (a)     Cheating offence (DAC-908870-2021): Seven months’ imprisonment;

> (b)     Attempted cheating offence (DAC-910773-2021): One month’s imprisonment; and

> (c)     Both sentences are to run consecutively.
