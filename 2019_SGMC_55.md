Civil Procedure – Enforcement – Writ of Seizure and Sale – Bailiff’s Interpleader

Evidence – Burden of Proof

6 September 2019

### Deputy Registrar Patrick Tay Wei Sheng:

1       When a chattel has been seized in execution, a person who claims it may challenge the seizure by filing a claim with the Sheriff. If the execution creditor disputes the claim, the Sheriff will apply to court for relief. The court will order the claimant and the execution creditor to interplead (_ie_, claim against one another) and may then decide the title to the chattel.

2       What then does a claimant have to prove in a Sheriff’s interpleader? Before me, the claimant (the “Claimant”) suggested that it sufficed for him to prove that the execution debtor had no title to the chattel seized, because an execution creditor can seize only chattel that is owned by the execution debtor. The execution creditor (the “Bank”) argued however, that the Claimant had to prove a positive title to the chattel failing which the chattel should not be released to him.

## Background

3       The Claimant is the father-in-law of the execution debtor (“the Defendant”). Together with their respective spouses, the Claimant and the Defendant live together at and are joint owners of an apartment (the “Apartment”). On the application of the Bank, a writ of seizure and sale was executed at the Apartment. Four items with a total value of $380 were seized: (a) an LCD television; (b) a sofa and coffee-table set; (c) a refrigerator; and (d) a washing machine (collectively, the “Seized Items”).

4       The Claimant gave notice to the Bailiff of the State Courts that he claimed all of the Seized Items. The Bank disputed the claim. The Bailiff thus brought this interpleader summons. Given the relatively straightforward nature of the dispute, the low value of the Seized Items, and the consent of the parties the same, the summons came before me for summary determination under O 17 r 5(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2014 Rev Ed) (the “ROC”).

## The Law

5       The suggestion of the Claimant that it sufficed for him to prove that the Defendant did not have title to the Seized Items was premised on the notion that a writ of execution was exigible only on the proprietary interests of the execution debtor. Hence, insofar as the execution debtor had no interest in the seized chattel at the material time, the seizure was wrongful and the chattel had to be released.

6       This submission found support in the rather dated English decision in _Edwards v English_ (1857) 7 E & B 564. There, the Court of Appeal in Chancery framed the issue to be tried as whether the chattel seized had been that of the execution creditor such that the execution was not wrongful. See the speeches of Erle J, “whether the execution debtor … had goods liable to be taken in execution”; Crompton J, “whether \[the execution creditor\] had a right to order the sheriff to seize these goods under the execution, as \[the execution debtor’s\] goods”; and Campbell CJ, “whether the \[execution\] creditor had a right to seize the goods”. Further, this was the “substance” of the inquiry in a Sheriff’s interpleader, and applied regardless which party bore the burden of proof (_per_ Campbell CJ).

7       But subsequent decisions both in the UK and elsewhere formulated the issue differently. In _Richards v Jenkins_ \[1887\] 18 QBD 451, the English Court of Appeal held that the question was “whether the goods are the goods of the claimant as against the execution creditor … at the time of the execution”, and that it was immaterial that the execution debtor had been estopped from asserting that the goods did not belong to the claimant. There, the claimant, having let goods for hire, became bankrupt. The goods, while in the possession of the hirer, were taken in execution under a judgment against the hirer. The court gave judgment for the execution creditor because the title to the goods had upon the bankruptcy of the claimant passed to his trustee-in-bankruptcy. In consequence, the claimant had at the time of the seizure no more title to or interest in the goods.

8       In _Bryce Brothers v Kinnee_ \[1892\] OJ No 262 (“_Bryce Brothers_”) at \[22\], the Ontario High Court of Justice observed that an execution creditor could set up the title of a third party to the goods as a defence to a claim to them, but that the claimant could not do the same as against the execution creditor. This was because the claimant was interfering in the execution of the judgment, and it sufficed for the execution creditor to show that the claimant ought not to so interfere whoever else might have been entitled to do so.

> In _Cababé on Interpleader_ the author, at p. 56, states a rule with respect to setting up the _jus tertii_ which seems in itself quite logical, but refers to no direct authority in support of it. It is in these words: "It is submitted that the true rule is that although the execution creditor can set up a _jus tertii_ against the claimant, yet the claimant cannot set up a _jus tertii_ against the execution creditor." The reasoning is, if a claimant interferes with a creditor's execution, the creditor should have a right to shew that, at all events, the claimant ought not to have interfered, whoever else perhaps might have done so, but has not: on the other hand, the claimant, having caused the issue, by asserting his right to the goods, ought not to be allowed to set up a case shewing that the goods belong to third parties, who have not intervened in the matter at all.

9       More recently, in _Tan Kim Khuan v Tan Kee Kiat (M) Sdn Bhd_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 1 MLJ 697</span> (“_Tan Kim Khuan_”), the High Court of Melaka held that a claimant had to show that he was the lawful owner of the property at the time of the attachment. Further, if such ownership had been obtained by purchase or otherwise, the transaction must have been _bona fide_ (citing _Sigma Air Conditioning Sdn Bhd v World Wide Agencies (M) Sdn Bhd_ <span class="citation">\[1980\] 1 MLJ 179</span> (“_Sigma Air_”) at 181). Also, it was insufficient for the claimant to show that the chattel had been owned by a third party, and the execution creditor would prevail if it was shown that there was a better title to the goods in a third party (citing _Richards v Jenkins_ and _De Borbon v Westminister Bank_ \[1933\] 49 TLR 414).

10     That said, the need for a claimant to establish a title to or interest in the chattel seized did not require him to show an absolute title to the chattel. It sufficed that the claimant had some legal or equitable interest in the chattel at the time of the seizure. For example, claimants had succeeded by showing an interest in the chattel as agent or bailee of the owner thereof (_Green v Stevens_ (1857) 2 H&N 146), or as joint owner together with the execution creditor (_Peake v Carter_ <span class="citation">\[1916\] 1 KB 652</span>).

11     Still, complications had arisen where, as in this case, chattel had been seized from premises where multiple persons were in simultaneous ownership and occupation. As the High Court of Kuala Lumpur observed in _Overseas Investment Pte Ltd v Anthony William O\`Brien & Anor_ <span class="citation">\[1988\] 3 MLJ 332</span> (“_Overseas Investment_”), “it would be imprudent to assume that everything in the house belongs to the registered owner or even to the nominal head of the family”.

> … the basis of the creditor\`s right to attach arises from the fact that the circumstances are such that it is reasonable to presume that the defendant is the reputed owner of the goods. Possession is said to be nine-tenths of the law! So if a house is in the exclusive occupation of the defendant, his execution creditor may have some justification to attach. But where a number of persons are in simultaneous occupation of a house, as for example, one occupied by several wage-earning members, it would be imprudent to assume that everything in the house belongs to the registered owner or even to the nominal head of the family. In the present case, there was no evidence whatsoever before the registrar that the defendant was the owner of the premises or even that he was residing there at any material time. Consequently, the plaintiff had not even laid the foundation for any presumptive ownership in the defendant when the goods were seized.

12     Ultimately, the weight of authority pointed to a positive obligation on the part of a claimant to prove a title to or interest in the chattel seized. This was particularly since the English Court of Appeal in _Richard v Jenkins_ had rejected an argument by the claimant there based on _Edwards v English_ that it sufficed for him to show that the title to the chattel had passed to his trustee-in-bankruptcy. Hence, it did not suffice for the claimant to prove that the title to the chattel seized was in a third party. Equally, the claimant could not discharge his burden of proof by showing that the execution debtor did not have any title to or interest in the chattel. There were both conceptual and practical justifications for this. Conceptually, the claimant interfered in the execution, and it was for him to prove his entitlement to do so (see _Bryce Brothers_ at \[22\]). Practically, too, the seized chattel if ordered to be released by the court would be released to the claimant. The strict requirement that the claimant had to demonstrate his title to the chattel thus discouraged unmeritorious claims and minimised subsequent disputes as to the ownership of the chattel. Indeed, the Court of Appeal had cautioned against adopting a liberal approach towards exercising its powers within the interpleader process, albeit in the context of the grant of interpleader relief (see _Precious Shipping Public Co Ltd and others v OW Bunker Far East (Singapore) Pte Ltd and others and other matters_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1229</span> at \[18\]).

13     Nevertheless, as observed by the High Court in _Leowood Industries (S) Pte Ltd v Annho Pte Ltd and Others_ <span class="citation">\[1994\] SGHC 65</span> the possession of a chattel by a claimant at the time of its seizure is _prima facie_ evidence of his title to it. The claimant could thus be presumed to be the owner of the chattel until the contrary had been proved by the execution creditor (_Overseas Investment_). In effect, the burden of proof was reversed and the execution creditor had to show that the claimant has no title to or interest in the chattel at the time of the seizure.

14     The decision of the English Court of Appeal in _De La Rue v Hernu, Peron & Stockwell, Limited_ (1936) 2 KB 164 (“_De La Rue_”) was instructive. There, a wife deposited goods with warehousemen for storage. Her husband claimed that the goods were his property, and applied to the Court to compel the warehousemen to deliver up the goods. The wife brought a claim for the goods, and the warehousemen took out an interpleader summons in the action. The Court held that because the deposit of the goods with the warehousemen had been made by the wife, “she was in the position of a person in possession, having nine-tenths of the law” (at 170). The husband had therefore to bear the burden of proof and “make out his case” to the goods as against the wife.

15     The power of the court in an interpleader summons to order the execution creditor to bear the burden of proof had also been set out in O 17 r 5(1)(b) of the ROC. Thereunder, the court could “direct which of the claimants is to be plaintiff and which defendant”, albeit “not a plaintiff in the technical sense of the word, because \[an interpleader summons\] is not an action, but in the position of a plaintiff” (_De La Rue_ at 170). And where the applicant in the interpleader summons was the Sheriff or the Bailiff, or where any of the claimants to the seized chattel so requested, the court could then summarily determine the question in issue (O 17 r 5(2) of the ROC).

> **Powers of Court hearing originating summons or summons (O. 17, r. 5)**

> **5.**—(1)    Where on the hearing of an originating summons or a summons under this Order all the persons by whom adverse claims to the subject-matter in dispute (referred to in this Order as the claimants) appear, the Court may order —

>> (a)    that any claimant be made a defendant in any action pending with respect to the subject-matter in dispute in substitution for or in addition to the applicant for relief under this Order; or

>> (b)    that an issue between the claimants be stated and tried and may direct which of the claimants is to be plaintiff and which defendant.

> (2)    Where —

>> (a)    the applicant in an originating summons or a summons under this Order is the Sheriff;

>> (b)    all the claimants consent or any of them so requests; or

>> (c)    the question at issue between the claimants is a question of law and the facts are not in dispute,

> the Court may summarily determine the question at issue between the claimants and make an order accordingly on such terms as may be just.

## Decision

16     All four of the Seized Items had been seized at the Apartment, of which the Defendant was a joint owner at the time of the execution. I did not therefore think it appropriate to reverse the burden of proof, even though the Claimant was also a joint owner of the Apartment. Hence, the Claimant had to prove, on a balance of probabilities, a lawful title to the Seized Items at the time of the seizure in order to succeed in this interpleader summons.

### Television, sofa and coffee table set, washing machine

17     The Claimant testified that he had purchased the television, the sofa and coffee table set, and the washing machine between 2008 and 2009. This was at or around the time when he and his wife moved into the Apartment. He added that he had been working and drawing a salary at that time and had paid for these three items, but had misplaced or discarded the relevant receipts in the years since.

18     The Bank did not directly challenge this evidence, but pointed to the joint ownership of the Apartment by the Defendant as proof that the Defendant had a title to the television, the sofa and coffee-table set, and the washing machine.

19     In _Tan Kim Khuan_, the High Court of Melaka had held that the unchallenged oral evidence of the claimant on her title to the chattel seized did not suffice even to establish a _prima facie_ case of ownership, and that there was thus no need for the execution creditor to lead any evidence on the issue. There, the chattel in question was an air-conditioner unit that had been installed at and seized from premises that were _owned by the execution debtor_. The claimant had gone to those premises occasionally, but did not reside there. The Court held that the bare assertion of the claimant to the contrary, did not displace the _prima facie_ evidence of title to the air-conditioner unit on the part of the execution debtor based on his ownership of the premises where it had been installed. This decision has been approved by the Malaysian Court of Appeal in _AIMB Marketing Sdn Bhd & Ors v Malaysian Trustees Bhd & Ors_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 5 MLJ 210</span>. In my view, nevertheless, _Tan Kim Khuan_ suggested only that unchallenged oral evidence by a claimant cannot rebut a _prima facie_ case of ownership on the part of the execution debtor, which _prima facie_ case was established by the execution debtor’s ownership of the premises in question there.

20     Here, the Apartment was owned not only by the Defendant but also by the Claimant. It was thus unclear to me that the Defendant had such possession of the television, the sofa and coffee table set, or the washing machine as to prove her _prima facie_ case of ownership of the items. I thus turned to the other objective evidence as to the ownership of these three items.

21     It was undisputed that Apartment had been acquired by the Claimant and his wife in their joint names in 1998. It was also undisputed that the Defendant had moved into the apartment only in 2013, and had become a joint owner of the apartment only in 2015, when she married the son of the Claimant. The Bank did not challenge the evidence of the Claimant that the television, the sofa and coffee table set, and the washing machine had been acquired before the Defendant had moved into the Apartment. Nor did the Bank suggest that the title to these three items had been transferred to the Defendant, or that anyone other than the Claimant and the Defendant could have owned the three items. The Claimant also gave evidence that it was predominantly he, as a retiree, who used the television and the sofa and coffee table set, having so worn out the sofa that “there \[are\] holes in the sofa”.

22     On a balance of probabilities, I therefore concluded that it was the Claimant and not the Defendant who had title to the television, the sofa and coffee table set, and the washing machine.

### Refrigerator

23     The Claimant testified that he had bought the refrigerator in 2018 together with his wife, and had paid at least part of the purchase price out of the financial assistance that he received as a member of the “Pioneer Generation” in Singapore. He adduced a purchase receipt with the words, “Mdm Chan”, together with a mobile number. He added that he had not put his own name and telephone number on the receipt because his mobile line had been pre-paid, and he had been unsure if he had sufficient telephone credits to be contactable on that line when the refrigerator was to be delivered to the Apartment.

24     There was no dispute that “Mdm Chan” referred to the wife of the Claimant.

25     In cross-examination, the Claimant conceded that the Defendant had been added as a joint owner of the Apartment in 2015 because he (and his wife) did not have the money to service the housing loan following his retirement. He accepted also that by adding the Defendant as a joint owner, the housing loan could be serviced out of the Central Provident Fund monies of the Defendant. The Bank thus submitted that the Claimant could not have had the monies to pay for the refrigerator at the material time, and that the refrigerator must therefore have been bought by the Defendant.

26     I accepted the evidence of the Claimant that he had paid, at least in part, for the refrigerator. First, he was generally a candid witness. For example, he readily conceded that his financial constraints necessitated the addition of the Defendant as a joint owner of the Apartment to use her Central Provident Fund monies to service the housing loan. Second, the Bank did not challenge his evidence had he had paid for the refrigerator out of the financial assistance that he had received as a member of the “Pioneer Generation” in Singapore. Third, the receipt for the refrigerator set out “Mdm Chan” not as the payor but simply as a contact person. This corroborated the account of the Claimant that the listing of only “Mdm Chan” on the receipt did not exhaustively reflect the identity of the person(s) who had paid for the refrigerator.

27     In any event, even if the refrigerator had been paid for entirely by the wife of the Claimant, I found that the Claimant had sufficient interest in the refrigerator to establish his claim to it. A claimant in an interpleader summons did not have to prove an absolute title to the chattel, and could succeed as long as he showed sufficient title to or interest therein at the time of the seizure. Further, such title could be acquired by the claimant through a transaction with a counterparty, even if the counterparty was the execution debtor, as long as the transaction had been entered into _bona fide_ and not for the purpose of defeating the execution. (_Sigma Air_; _Tan Kim Khuan_).

28     In _Equus Financial Services v Lytfi_ \[1995\] VicSC 59, the execution debtors had been involved in a dispute with a third party, who had a livestock lien over the cattle owned by the execution debtors. The third party put the cattle up for sale by auction, at which sale the execution debtors allegedly purchased the cattle on behalf of their children. The cattle were subsequently seized by the execution creditors under a writ of seizure and sale, and the children brought a claim for the cattle. The Supreme Court of Victoria held, on the facts, that the sale of the cattle to the children had been genuine and that the children owned the cattle for two reasons. First, the execution debtors were not entitled to have purchased the cattle at the auction. Second, only the children and not the execution debtors had the funds to purchase the cattle.

29     To its credit, the Bank was prepared to accept the Claimant as the representative of his wife for the purpose of this interpleader summons, and not insist that the wife bring a separate claim for the refrigerator. Given the evidence that the refrigerator was owned, if not by the Claimant then by his wife, I found that the Claimant had made out a sufficient interest in the refrigerator.

## Conclusion

30     I therefore released all four of the Seized Items to the Claimant.

31     The Claimant had filed a previous interpleader summons. That summons was dismissed because the Claimant failed to attend the hearing. The Bank did not seek the costs of that hearing. In that light, I made no order as to the costs of this hearing.
