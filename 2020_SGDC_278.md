Criminal Law – Offences – Prevention of Corruption Act

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9033/2020/01.\]

4 December 2020

### District Judge Kessler Soh:

## Introduction

1       Mr Derek Gordon Pigg, aged 66 years, was a purchasing manager with Transocean Eastern Pte Ltd (“**Transocean**”), an offshore drilling contractor. Transocean purchased tubular goods, such as drill pipes, from a company known as Mid-Continent Tubular Pte Ltd (“**MCT**”). The defendant represented Transocean in its dealings with MCT. He dealt with a senior sales manager of MCT by the name of Yong Hock Guan Dennis (“**Yong**”). They had a cordial working relationship. At some point in their dealings they came to a common understanding to mutually profit from their dealings. This was done by building in a bribe amount into each transaction in which Transocean purchased goods from MCT. Yong would pay bribe money to the defendant and retain a portion for himself. Between July 2007 and November 2009, over eight occasions, Yong gave to the defendant various sums of money which amounted to $270,000.

2       The matter was subsequently investigated by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB). The defendant was charged with eight offences of corruptly accepting bribes from Yong, an offence under s 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241 (“**PCA**”). He claimed trial to the charges. At the conclusion of the trial he was found guilty and convicted on all the charges. On 6 February 2020, he was sentenced to a total imprisonment term of 15 months and ordered to pay a penalty of $270,000 (the total amount of bribes accepted by him). The defendant filed the present appeal against his conviction and sentence the same day.

3       The grounds of my decision are set out below.

## Trial

### Charges

4       The defendant faced eight charges under s 6(a) of the PCA. The charges were similarly worded, with different particulars relating to the date of the offence, the amount of gratification, and the goods or services transacted:

>     You \[...\] are charged that, on or about \[date\], in Singapore, being an agent, _to wit_, a Supply Chain Manager in the employ of Transocean Eastern Pte Ltd (“Transocean”), did corruptly accept from one Yong Hock Guan Dennis, a Sales Manager in the employ of Mid-Continent Tubular Pte Ltd (“Mid-Continent”), gratification in the amount of \[amount\] for yourself, as a reward for having done an act in relation to your principal’s affairs, _to wit_, having agreed to purchase \[goods/services\] for Transocean from Mid-Continent at a price above the lowest price which you could have negotiated for Transocean, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.[^1]

6       Section 6(a) of the PCA provides:

>     Punishment for corrupt transactions with agents

>     6. If —

>> (a)     _any agent corruptly accepts_ or obtains, or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain, from any person, _for himself_ or for any other person, any gratification as an inducement or _reward_ for doing or forbearing to do, or for _having done_ or forborne to do, _any act in relation to his principal’s affairs_ or business, or for showing or forbearing to show favour or disfavour to any person in relation to his principal’s affairs or business;

>> \[…\]

>     he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.

### Prosecution’s case

#### MCT supplied tubular goods to Transocean

7       MCT was in the business of buying and selling tubular goods. One of MCT’s customers was Transocean, a major offshore drilling contractor. At the material times, Yong was the senior sales manager of MCT and the company’s representative in its dealings with Transocean. Over at Transocean, the defendant was the regional supply chain manager, and the manager of global strategic sourcing for the Asia Pacific region from 2006. The defendant was responsible for procuring equipment for Transocean, which included the negotiation of prices on behalf of the company. It was not in dispute that the defendant dealt with Yong in relation to Transocean’s purchase of tubular products from MCT.[^2] On eight occasions between 2006 and 2008, Transocean purchased tubular goods and services from MCT. Invoices relating to these transactions were tendered in evidence at the trial.[^3]

#### Bribes were built into each transaction price

8       The main witness for the prosecution was Yong (PW1). Yong testified that it was the defendant who first hinted that he wanted “something out of the business”. The defendant suggested that there should be a kickback built into each transaction; he wanted at least two dollars per foot of drill pipe purchased. Yong proposed instead a bribe in the range of 1% to 2% of the transaction amount, and this was the understanding that they reached eventually. There was no fixed formula and no fixed amount of bribe for each transaction. Yong would simply set aside an amount of between 1% to 2% of each purchase order for the bribe. It was also agreed that Yong would have a 25% share in the bribe.[^4]

9       Yong’s superior, Ong Eng Kee (PW2, “**Ong**”), who was the managing director at MCT, was also called as a prosecution witness. Ong testified that he discussed with Yong that they could pay the defendant a “commission” of “between $1 to $3 per joint”. Translated into a percentage, this was 1 to 3 percent of the order price. Yong would seek approval from Ong before paying each bribe. On each occasion, Yong would submit to Ong a request for a cheque for “marketing expenses”, accompanied by a handwritten costing sheet (as well as other documents). The costing sheet would show, among other things, the company’s gross profit from the transaction and the “commission” that Yong would pay to the defendant. Ong understood the term “marketing expenses” to be a “bribe or commission paid on orders received”. Ong would “sign the approval” for the request for the cheque.[^5]

10     After that, Yong would submit the approval to the company’s accounting department. He would then be issued with a cash cheque together with a payment voucher. Documentary evidence of the cheque request, cash cheque issued and accompanying payment voucher relating to each charge was tendered in evidence.[^6] Yong would then encash the cash cheque. He did not give the entire sum to the defendant but kept about one quarter for himself; he would normally “round up” the sum that he handed to the defendant.[^7]

11     Yong testified to the ways in which he handed the monies to the defendant. For the “big amount\[s\]”, he drove to the defendant’s “office building” at Beach Road, to the Gateway West basement car park. There, he would meet up with the defendant and hand to him an envelope containing the cash. For the two occasions involving the “small amount” (the amounts of $5,000 in the 6th charge and the 8th charge), Yong said that he was “not very clear”. In respect of the 6th charge, he recalled driving to the residence of the defendant to hand him the money. For the 8th charge, he recalled giving the money to the defendant at a “hawker centre” on an occasion sometime after the defendant had left Transocean.[^8]

12     Yong also explained the rationale for these payments. It was to “secure a contract” and “make the buyer -- in this case Mr Pigg happy” and “generate sales”. The defendant was a “tough negotiator” and paying a bribe or kickback would “stop or slow down the negotiation in prices” and there would not be “too harsh type of negotiation” from the defendant. If no bribe was given, Yong would have to “reduce the price further and further in order to win the order” and he would have more difficulty getting a price that he could sell “with a decent profit for the company”.[^9]

#### Transocean was purchasing at above the lowest possible prices

13     It was the prosecution’s case that because of the inclusion of the bribe in the transaction price, the price at which Transocean purchased from MCT could never be the lowest possible price. As Yong explained, when he submitted a price to the defendant, the defendant would understand that this was the best price with an inclusion “to put aside between 1 to 2 per cent as a kickback, as a bribe”. The result of putting something aside for the bribe was that the price was “not rock-bottom”. It was “\[n\]ot the best competitive price” that the defendant could get.[^10] Even in respect of the price agreements between Transocean and MCT (a point raised by the defence, \[20\] below), Yong explained that there would still be an amount built into the price quoted in the price agreements which was for the payment of the bribes.[^11]

### Submission of no case to answer

14     At the close of the prosecution’s case, the defence made a submission of no case to answer.[^12] The defence submitted that Yong’s evidence, on which the prosecution’s case rested, was incomplete and incoherent and did not support the elements of the charges. For example, when Yong mentioned a “bribe”, he was vague and did not mention that it was a “reward”. There was no evidence that the monies paid were the cause or consequence of the defendant’s alleged actions. There was no prior agreement or mutual understanding regarding the purpose of the alleged bribe monies.

15     The prosecution submitted[^13] that there was ample evidence to satisfy each and every element of the charges. There was evidence from Yong that he paid gratification to the defendant on eight occasions. Yong testified that it was the defendant who first hinted that he wanted something out of the business and suggested that there should be a kickback built into each transaction. On that basis, the defendant and Yong reached an understanding that Yong would set aside something in each transaction. The amount set aside would generally constitute between 1% to 2% of the total price, and the defendant also agreed to give Yong a cut of this amount of approximately 25%. On each occasion that the bribe was to be paid, Yong would seek approval from Ong via a request for cheque, reflecting the purpose as “marketing expenses”. Once this was approved, he would submit it to the MCT accounting department. Yong also testified as to the reason for these corrupt payments. His objective was to keep the buyer (the defendant) happy and thereby “generate sales”. The payment of bribes or kickbacks would also keep the defendant from negotiating in a tough or harsh fashion, thereby allowing Yong to secure the contract at a price which would include “a decent profit for the company”.

16     I found the submission of no case to answer by the defence to be entirely without merit. Yong had given evidence of the bribes that he paid to the defendant on eight occasions. The bribe payments were given in the context of their business relationship. It was reasonable to infer that the payments were objectively corrupt. There was also evidence that the defendant had subjective knowledge that the payments were corrupt. Yong’s evidence was that it was the defendant who first hinted about receiving kickbacks, and they subsequently came to an understanding that a percentage of each transaction would be set aside as a bribe. Yong’s evidence was not inherently incredible. The evidence adduced by the prosecution did support each element of each charge[^14] and established a prima facie case for the defendant to answer.

17     Accordingly, I called upon the defendant to enter his defence.

### Defence: denial

18     The defendant elected to testify. He denied receiving the sums stated in the first seven charges. On the eighth charge, he said that he received a sum of $6,000 from Yong, but he denied that it was corrupt.

19     The defendant testified that at the material time, he was the global strategic sourcing manager in Transocean. This entailed him going out to “get best agreements, best fixed pricing agreements for the company in the region and globally.” As part of the process of getting the best agreements for Transocean, he would approach multiple vendors for quotations and would heavily scrutinize these quotations to ascertain the best deal for Transocean. If he felt that he could still negotiate a better deal, he would try to go back and have negotiations to look for a better price. It was always the norm that pricing would be “the best that we can avail of”. His approach to negotiation applied equally in his dealings with MCT. “Like every other vendor, it's been professional. I worked within the realm of what I have always worked with, to achieve what \[...\] would be \[…\] beneficial to Transocean at all times.”[^15]

20     Notwithstanding a volatile steel market at the material time (it being a seller’s market), the defendant managed to negotiate the best prices for Transocean by securing highly favourable fixed-price agreements for the company. These “pricing agreements” were agreements where prices for goods (such as drill pipes) were fixed for a period of time, rather than be subject to periodic revision. There were pricing agreements with MCT in effect from 1 September 2006 to 31 August 2007 (Exh D4) and from 1 September 2007 to 31 August 2008 (Exh D1). The pricing agreements were highly beneficial to Transocean as, otherwise, Transocean would be “at the mercy of the seller” and sellers would be able to change their prices unilaterally. For this achievement, the defendant was lauded by his superiors. The defendant was so highly regarded that he was called upon to negotiate contracts concurrently with other Transocean staff members to try to “beat” the quotations or proposals they were receiving.[^16]

21     The only monies that the defendant ever received from Yong was the $6,000. After the defendant left Transocean, he met Yong sometime at the end of October or in November at a coffeeshop in Siglap for a casual chat and coffee. Just before they left, Yong handed to him an envelope. He opened the envelope when he returned home and was surprised to find that it contained $6,000. He did not have any ill-thoughts whatsoever about it and thought that it was a kind gesture on the part of Yong.[^17]

22     The defendant denied receiving money from Yong apart from the $6,000. He said this consistently in his statements to the CPIB on 6 March 2013[^18], 5 June 2013[^19] and 27 December 2013[^20].

### Issues to be determined

23     The elements of an offence under s 6(a) of the PCA were set out in _Kwang Boon Keong Peter v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 2 SLR(R) 211</span> at \[32\] as follows:

> (a)     Acceptance of gratification.

> (b)     As an inducement or reward (for the conferment of a benefit).

> (c)     There was an objective corrupt element in the transaction.

> (d)     The recipient accepted the gratification with guilty knowledge.

(See the decision of the Court of Appeal in _PP v Leng Kah Poh_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 1264</span> at \[20\].)

24     The issues to be determined at the present trial were the following:

> (a)     Whether the defendant accepted gratification in the form of cash;

> (b)     Whether the gratification was for the conferment of a reward to the defendant (for agreeing to purchase tubular goods or services for Transocean from MCT at a price above the lowest price which he could have negotiated for Transocean);

> (c)     Whether there was an objective corrupt element in the acceptance of the gratification;

> (d)     Whether the defendant accepted the gratification with guilty knowledge.

25     The determination of these issues ultimately turned on the question of whether Yong’s testimony was convincing, and whether the defendant’s evidence and the case put forth by the defence had cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution’s case.

### Decision

#### Yong’s evidence about bribing the defendant was convincing

26     The defence sought to portray Yong as an unreliable witness who was lying about having made corrupt payments to the defendant and falsely implicating the defendant. The defence submitted that Yong was unable to give consistent testimony about when the alleged agreement with the defendant for the bribes occurred. Yong gave various versions, stating that it could have occurred sometime near July 2007[^21], or before 2006[^22], or that there could have been two conversations between him and the defendant regarding bribes[^23]. It was the case for the defence that Yong never paid any bribes to the defendant. The defence suggested that, whatever may have been the arrangement that Yong had with his superior (Ong) to bribe the defendant, Yong had in fact pocketed _all_ the bribe monies and used it to fund his lavish lifestyle in which he constantly lived beyond his means. Yong admitted in cross-examination that his basic income could not sustain his living, and he spent the money that he had pocketed to “enjoy \[his\] life”. He admitted that on one occasion he drew a sum of $99,008 from MCT and used the money to upgrade to a bigger apartment.[^24] The defence suggested that he had pocketed all the monies for himself but did not come clean to the CPIB about it to minimize his own criminal exposure. Ong (Yong’s superior) had no personal knowledge whether bribes were actually paid to the defendant: everything Ong knew was based solely upon information provided to him by Yong.[^25]

27     The prosecution submitted that Yong had given cogent and consistent evidence of the eight occasions that he paid gratification to the defendant. There was supporting documentary evidence. There was no reason for Yong to lie. He had pleaded guilty and been sentenced for his role in the matter, and he was serving sentence when he gave testimony in court.[^26] There was nothing that Yong could expect to gain by implicating the defendant. The defendant described his relationship with Yong as “cordial” and conceded that Yong could not be trying to frame him because of any disagreement or friction between them.[^27]

28     Having considered the entirety of Yong’s testimony, I found his evidence to be truthful, coherent and convincing. I found no plausible reason for Yong to frame the defendant and falsely implicate him. The suggestion by the defence that Yong was trying to minimise his criminal exposure by not admitting that he had taken all the money (and putting part of the blame on the defendant) was speculative. It was also highly unlikely. Had that been Yong’s intention, it made no sense for him to admit to taking a _portion_ of each bribe sum for himself on each occasion; he could have pushed the entire blame to the defendant. It also made no sense for him to admit to taking the _full_ sum of the intended bribe on one occasion.[^28] Indeed, if Yong had all along kept all the bribe money for himself, it would have made no sense at all for Yong to take the trouble to meet with the defendant and hand the defendant a sum of $5,000 (or $6,000, according to the defendant) after the defendant had left Transocean (above, at \[11\], \[21\]): Yong could simply have kept the entire sum for himself.

29     Yong’s testimony about paying bribes to the defendant was corroborated by his superior, Ong. On each occasion that a bribe was to be paid, Yong would seek the approval of Ong via a request for a cheque, reflecting the purpose as “marketing expenses” (above, at \[9\]). Yong also testified that his understanding with the defendant was that for each transaction, an amount of 1% to 2% of the transaction price would be set aside as a bribe (above, at \[8\]). In the course of his testimony, Yong was asked to perform calculations of the total transaction amount in respect of each charge by adding up the relevant invoices, and to express the “marketing expenses” as a percentage of the total transaction amount.[^29] The salient information derived from these calculations are set out in the table below:

30     The percentages shown in column (c) of the table above are largely in the range of 1% to 2%. This accorded with Yong’s testimony that 1% to 2% of the total transaction price was set aside as bribe money or “marketing expenses”, and lent credence to his testimony.

31     The only outlier was the 6th charge (11.53%). Unlike the other charges, the 6th charge related to the purchase of _services_ rather than goods. The transaction was for the application of internal plastic coatings to drill pipes.[^30] This transaction was unusual. As was explained by Yong, MCT was a “drill pipe tubular _stockist_” and did not provide such “applicator” services directly. MCT would have to “pass this job to a contractor to do it, and then \[…\] mark it up and bill it to \[Transocean\]”. It did not make sense for Transocean to engage MCT to provide this service. The only reason that the defendant did so was to get “a kickback out of these services”.[^31] Yong’s evidence was corroborated by Ong. Ong testified that MCT was “just a distributor” and did not provide coating services, and he could not explain why, in this case, Transocean had procured the coating services from MCT.[^32] I found Yong’s evidence to be credible. It did not make commercial sense for Transocean to engage MCT to provide internal plastic applicator services; Yong’s explanation that MCT was engaged so that the defendant could receive a kickback was credible.

32     Yong also testified that he kept about one quarter of the bribe money for himself, and he would normally round _up_ the amount that he handed to the defendant (above, at \[10\]). The table below sets out, for each transaction, the amount set aside as “marketing expenses” (total bribe amount), the amount that Yong handed to the defendant, the amount that Yong retained, and the amount retained expressed as a percentage of the total bribe amount.

  

33     Again, this was largely consistent with Yong’s testimony. Yong did not retain _precisely_ 25% for himself, and the bribe amount was not a matter of precise mathematical calculation. As was explained by Yong, he would round _up_ the defendant’s (75%) share and retain the remainder of the bribe for himself. It was also apparent that in two instances, relating to the smaller amounts in the 6th and 8th charges, Yong took more than his fair share. On yet another occasion, which did not relate to the charges, Yong pocketed the entire sum (see footnote 28). These instances where Yong took more than was meant for him did not detract from the credibility of his testimony about his understanding with the defendant about how they would share the bribe monies, and that he paid various sums to the defendant as bribes according to the understanding they had reached.

34     The evidence showed that Yong honoured his illicit bargain with the defendant even after the defendant had left Transocean. It was not in dispute that there was an occasion in late 2009 when Yong met with the defendant and gave the defendant an envelope containing a sum of money (above, at \[11\], \[21\]). According to Yong, the sum was $5,000; according to the defendant, it was $6,000. Why did Yong give such a large sum of money to the defendant? The defendant was unable to provide a satisfactory answer to this question. The suggestion by the defence that it was a “gesture of goodwill” was unconvincing. On the other hand, Yong’s evidence that it was “bribe money” for the defendant[^33] provided the only plain, simple and credible explanation.

35     Although Yong was not able to recall perfectly and precisely _when_ the defendant and he had spoken about their bribe arrangement, the lapses in Yong’s memory could be attributed to the passage of time and did not undermine the credibility of his testimony. By the time Yong testified at the trial in 2018, some of the events that he was asked to describe had occurred more than ten years before, and his inability to recall perfectly was hardly surprising.

36     Having considered the evidence in totality, I found Yong to be a truthful witness, and his testimony to be coherent and convincing.

#### Defendant’s denials were not truthful

37     Conversely, I found the evidence of the defendant to be untruthful.

38     When the defendant was cross-examined about the sum of money that he had received from Yong, he said that he did not think there was anything wrong or corrupt about receiving the money, because he was “out of Transocean” at the time, there was “no relevance to Transocean” and he did not link it back to Transocean whatsoever.[^34]

39     The prosecution cross-examined the defendant on a statement that he had given to the CPIB on 5 June 2013 (Exh P36). (The defence did not challenge the voluntariness of the statement but made reservations concerning the accuracy of the contents.) In the statement, the defendant stated that it was _wrong_ for him to have accepted the money:

> 21    I am now asked by the recording officer why Dennis Yong had given me the $6,000/- for. _I wish to say that Dennis Yong had given me this money for the years of support to his company MCT while I was employed at TE. By support, I mean TE business which I awarded to MCT in my position as TE's Global Strategic Sourcing Manager_. So I saw this $6,000/- Dennis Yong gave me as a token of appreciation for my support.

> 22    The recording officer now asks me to confirm whether it was wrong of me to have accepted money from Dennis Yong which was given because of my years of support to MCT. I wish to say that yes, _it was wrong of me to have accepted this money from him as it was given to me for the business from TE I had given to MCT over the years._ \[…\][^35]

>     (Emphasis added)

40     The defendant also said that he was “feeling shocked and afraid” when he first looked inside the envelope that Yong had given him and found that it contained $6,000:

> 20    \[…\] At the time, I was _feeling shocked and afraid_ since all along, the only money I had gotten was as my wages. So _to receive such a huge $6,000/- “ang pow” was shocking_, and _afraid because I did not know why I was being \[given\] such a large sum of money_ at that time. [^36]

>     (Emphasis added)

41     At the conclusion of the statement, he reiterated his admission that what he did was wrong:

> 25    \[…\] I wish to say that I wish to ask the authorities for mercy. I am devastated by this case. I am so sorry for what has happened in this case, and I truly repent for it. I should have thought about what I was doing more carefully. \[…\][^37]

42     When confronted with the discrepancy between his testimony in court and the admissions in the statement, the defendant sought to explain it away by alleging that what was recorded in the statement had been “suggested” to him by the recording officer.[^38] He conceded, however, that he was able to make amendments to the statement if he wished, and he had in fact made amendments to other parts of the statement.[^39]

43     Other statements of the defendant were admitted in evidence as well. After the defendant’s testimony had been completed, the prosecution disclosed to the defence other statements of the defendant that had not been used by the prosecution. The defence was given time to peruse the statements. The defence then applied for the defendant to be recalled for two other statements to be admitted. The position of the defence was that the two statements were consistent with the evidence that the defendant had given.[^40]

44     The first statement admitted by the defence was a statement of 6 March 2013 (Exh D16), which was the defendant’s very first statement to the CPIB. In the statement, he gave the following account of the incident where he received the $6,000 from Yong:

> 12.    \[...\] I have taken a sum of money from Dennis Yong before. It happened sometime near the Christmas of 2009. Dennis called me and asked me to meet him at a coffeeshop in Siglap for a cup of coffee. When I met him at the coffeeshop, he passed me a stack of cash enclosed in an envelope. I did not count it on the spot; I only did so when I returned home. It was a sum of S$6000. He mentioned that this money was a goodwill gesture to thank me for my support given to him over the years. At the time, I had already left TE. _From his gift and his words, I understand the money to be a token of appreciation from Dennis for the business that I had given to MCT. I know that it is wrong of me to have accepted the money due to the relationship Dennis and I had since his company supplied drilling equipments while I was in the position to order them from him._ \[...\][^41]

>     (Emphasis added)

45     He also stated that he had taken the money out of “greed”:

> Q6.    Why did you take that S$6000 from Dennis?

> A6.    It was a moment of folly. I had taken it out of greed. I admit that I should not have accepted it.[^42]

46     (Subsequently, the defendant sent a letter to the CPIB dated 5 April 2013 seeking to clarify and retract parts of the statement about the money he had received from Yong.[^43] In his further statement to the CPIB on 5 June 2013 (Exh P36), he confirmed that he did receive the money from Yong, but retracted his earlier statement that he had taken it out of greed.[^44])

47     The second statement admitted by the defence was the defendant’s (further) statement of 27 December 2013 (Exh D17). The defendant stated that it was possible Yong gave him the money because of the business he had had given to MCT while he was working at Transocean, and he could not think of any other possible reason why Yong would give him the money:

> Q18    If you did not consider him as a personal friend, why would you have taken any money from him in the first place?

> A18    I just thought it was a kind gesture on his part. What I mean by this is that it was possible that the reason that Dennis gave me \[…\] the money because of the business I had given to Dennis and MCT when I worked at TE. I cannot think of any other possible reason why Dennis would give me the sum of money. We only knew each other through the business between MCT and TE, and nothing else. \[…\][^45]

48     It would be readily apparent from these excerpts of the defendant’s statements that there were material contradictions between what he had told the CPIB in the course of investigations, and his subsequently testimony in court. In his statements, he connected the money that he received from Yong to the business that he had awarded to MCT, and he admitted that it was wrong of him to have taken the money. In his testimony in court, he asserted that his receipt of the money from Yong was not connected with his time at Transocean and there was nothing wrong in receiving the money (above, at \[38\]).

49     The defence sought to argue that all the admissions found in the defendant’s statements had been suggested to him by the officers who recorded the statements. The defence asserted that:[^46]

> (a)     For the statement of 6 March 2013, the contents of para 12 (reproduced at \[44\], above) had been suggested by the recording officer SSI Ang Zhi Quan (PW6) or the CPIB officers present during the recording.

> (b)     For the statement of 5 June 2013, the contents of paras 21 and 22 (reproduced at \[39\]) had been suggested by the recording officer SSI Xie Mingyin (PW4, “**IO Xie**”), who was also the investigating officer of the case.

> (c)     For the statement of 27 December 2013, the contents of the answer to question 18 (reproduced at \[47\]) had been suggested by the recording officer SSI Muhammad Iskhandar (PW7).[^47] In this regard, the defence highlighted that in the defendant’s earlier answers to two questions (A15 and A16), the defendant said he had no idea why Yong had given him the $6,000. After that, at A18, the defendant was recorded as saying that “it was possible” that Yong had given him the $6,000 for reasons relating to Transocean’s dealings with MCT. The defence submitted that the defendant was prompted and asked to think of possible reasons for Yong to have given him the $6,000, and that was how he arrived at A18.

50     The prosecution called the recording officer of each statement as rebuttal witness.[^48] All three recording officers denied the defendant’s allegation that they had suggested the answers to him. It was highlighted by the prosecution that the defendant gave three statements to different officers in the CPIB over a period of nine months. It was submitted that it was unbelievable that three different recording officers, each of whom had no personal interest in the matter, would all prompt the defendant into making the same admission.

51     I found the three recording officers to be truthful witnesses, and I accepted the submission of the prosecution. What was recorded in the statements – the exculpatory parts (above, at \[22\]) as well as the admissions – was what the defendant had told the recording officers. The defendant was able to make amendments to each statement if he wished. His allegation that the statements contained portions suggested to him by the recording officers was not credible at all.

52     There was another instance where the defendant was shown to be untruthful. In respect of the statement of 5 June 2013, the defendant testified that he had gone to the CPIB that day _to collect his passport_. According to him, he had requested IO Xie for his passport to go on a holiday for his mother-in-law’s 80th birthday, and he claimed that he even showed IO Xie the itinerary for his overseas travel. When he went to the CPIB that day, he was expecting that it would be a short meeting for him to receive his passport, and he did not expect that his statement would be recorded. He signed the statement hastily as he was anxious that his wife was waiting for him.[^49] It was submitted by the defence that the defendant felt pressure to sign the statement hastily and did not scrutinise the statement carefully.

53     The defendant’s claim about having gone to the CPIB to collect his passport was, however, roundly rebutted by IO Xie. IO Xie testified that he had asked the defendant to come down to the CPIB for a _statement recording_ on 5 June 2013, and it was not connected in any way with the return of the defendant’s passport. The very first time that the defendant requested to travel was on 27 January 2014 – more than seven months after that statement was recorded – when his counsel sent a letter to the CPIB on his behalf to apply to travel.[^50]

54     I found the defendant’s claim, that he had gone to the CPIB on 5 June 2013 to collect his passport, to be a complete fabrication and a lie. It undermined the credibility of his evidence.

55     Having evaluated the testimony of the defendant, I found it to be untruthful. Despite his denial, I found the payment received by the defendant from Yong to be a bribe. In the defendant’s statements, he had consistently connected that sum of money to the business that he had awarded to MCT while he was at Transocean, and he admitted that it was wrong for him to have received the money. The reason he made the connection was plain. As Yong testified, they had both entered into an arrangement where the defendant would be paid bribes from the purchases that Transocean made with MCT; and the defendant had accepted bribe payments from Yong on a number of prior occasions. There was simply no other reason for the defendant to have received money from Yong.

#### Transocean was not purchasing at the lowest possible prices

56     It was the case for the defence that the defendant managed to negotiate the best prices for Transocean by securing highly favourable fixed-price agreements for the company (above, at \[20\]). The defendant had negotiated for the best possible price for Transocean, and MCT was already locked into a price as a result of the price agreements. Therefore, there was no reason for bribes to be paid to the defendant if the defendant had asked for them.

57     The prosecution submitted, however, that the transaction prices that were agreed between MCT and Transocean could never be the lowest possible price that the defendant could have negotiated for Transocean. This was because, on the agreement between Yong and the defendant, the transaction prices would have had the bribes built in. Yong’s testimony was that, even in respect of the price agreements, there would still be a bribe built into the price (above, at \[13\]). The result was that the price could not be the lowest possible price.

58     The prosecution further submitted that the existence of a price agreement was not necessarily determinative of the prices at which Transocean purchased the tubular goods from MCT. For instance, there was an invoice dated 9 July 2008 that should fall within the scope of the price agreement from 1 September 2007 to 31 August 2008 (Exh D1). Yet the price for an item in that invoice differed from the price stated in the price agreement:

59     Furthermore, as was highlighted by the prosecution, there were several items in various invoices that did not fall within the ambit of any of the price agreements in the relevant period. This was a point that was conceded by the defendant under cross-examination by the prosecution.[^51]

60     The reasonable conclusion to be drawn from the evidence was that the existence of price agreements between Transocean and MCT did not preclude bribes being built into the transaction prices. It would logically follow that with bribes built into the prices, the prices at which Transocean purchased tubular goods (and services) from MCT were not the lowest possible prices that could have been negotiated.

#### Verdict

61     To sum up, having considered the entire evidence, I found the evidence of Yong to be convincing. I accepted the evidence of Yong that he did give to the defendant the bribes as stated in the eight charges. The bribes were given by Yong to the defendant after each transaction as a reward, although that might not have been stated explicitly. The defendant was untruthful in denying that he received the monies, or denying that there was anything wrong in him receiving money from Yong.

62     The giving and accepting of such monies were plainly and objectively corrupt. The defendant was an agent of his company, and in a position of authority to negotiate and enter into purchasing contracts on behalf of the company. For him to accept money in connection with such contracts with a supplier would be viewed objectively as corrupt by any reasonable person. The evidence also showed that the defendant accepted the gratification with guilty knowledge. As Yong testified, it was the defendant who first hinted that he wanted something out of the business, out of each transaction. In the defendant’s statements to the CPIB, he connected the money that he received from Yong to the business that he had awarded to MCT and admitted that it was wrong for him to have received the money. The irresistible inference was that the defendant had a guilty mind. As the bribe amounts were built into the price of each transaction, the prices negotiated by the defendant on behalf of Transocean with MCT would be above the lowest prices that he could have negotiated for his company.

63     Accordingly, I found that the prosecution had proven the charges against the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant was found guilty and convicted on the eight charges.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed sentence

64     The prescribed sentence for an offence under s 6 of the PCA is a fine not exceeding $100,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.

65     In addition, under s 13 of the PCA, where a court convicts a person of an offence of accepting any gratification, then the court shall order the person to pay, as a penalty, a sum which is equal to the amount of that gratification.

### Summary of sentencing positions

66     The positions of the prosecution and the defence in respect of the individual sentences and the global sentence are summarised in the following table:[^52]

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

67     The prosecution sought a global sentence of at least 18 months’ imprisonment, with a penalty of $270,000 to be imposed under s 13 of the PCA. It was submitted that the amounts of gratification were large, ranging from $5,000 to $60,000, adding up to $270,000. The defendant was the initiator of the corrupt scheme and was motivated by greed. He bore a greater degree of culpability for his actions compared to someone who had merely succumbed to temptation. The duration of the offending was significant, over about two years. Specific deterrence was necessary given the duration of the wrongdoing. There was real economic loss caused to the defendant’s company. As the bribe was part of the amount set aside and built into every transaction price, it formed part of the price that Transocean would have to pay MCT for its products. The defendant breached the trust placed in him by his company. He was in a senior position in Transocean and, by 2006, the global strategic sourcing manager. He was under a duty to negotiate for the lowest possible price that he could for his company, and he was in serious breach of that duty.

### Mitigation Plea

68     The defence submitted that a total sentence of four to seven months’ imprisonment would suffice. It was stated, in mitigation, that the defendant was a man of good character, an “upstanding individual of sterling character”. He had no antecedents. The charges represented his first brush with the law. The offences constituted a one-off aberration that was unlikely to be repeated. Transocean did not suffer any real detriment or, if it did, suffered low detriment. There was no claim that the tubular goods supplied by MCT were overpriced or defective. There was no evidence that the prices which MCT charged Transocean were ultimately higher than what Transocean would have agreed to pay.

### Decision on Sentence

#### Sentencing objective

69     In _PP v Tan Kok Ming Michael_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 207</span>, the High Court stated at \[99\] that the “main overarching sentencing considerations in corruption cases are deterrence and retribution”.

#### Parity with individual sentences of co-offenders

70     In deciding on the sentences to be imposed, I considered the need for parity with the sentences meted out to the co-offenders Yong and Ong. Both Yong and Ong had pleaded guilty to their charges. Their sentences for the corresponding charges faced by the defendant are summarised in the table below.

71     For the first charge involving a bribe of $60,000, Yong and Ong were sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment. This provided a relevant and useful reference point in calibrating the sentence for the defendant for the 1st charge, having regard to the defendant’s culpability compared with Yong and Ong.

72     The prosecution submitted that the defendant was more culpable than Yong and Ong and that there ought to be an uplift of one to two months’ imprisonment for the sentences on the individual charges. It was highlighted that the defendant was the initiator of the corrupt scheme. While Yong and Ong had pleaded guilty and demonstrated their remorse, the defendant chose to contest the charges against him; the defendant could not claim a discount in sentencing that would be accorded to an individual who had demonstrated his remorse and saved judicial time and resources by pleading guilty. While the charges of Yong and Ong involved larger sums than the defendant’s charges, this was due to Yong and Ong agreeing to pay the defendant a certain sum, and Yong and the defendant having a separate agreement in which Yong retained part of the bribe amount for himself. It was submitted that the difference in the amounts, while not insignificant, were not so large as to justify a lower sentence being imposed on the defendant, once the other factors were considered.

73     The defence submitted, on the other hand, that the defendant’s sentences ought to be _lower_ than that of Yong and Ong. The charges of Yong and Ong related to larger amounts of gratification. There were a number of aggravating factors in Yong’s case: _PP v Yong Hock Guan Dennis_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 12</span> (at \[9\]-\[10\]). While there was a “significant amount of planning involved” in Yong’s case, there was no evidence of a significant amount of planning on the part of the defendant. All he had done was to hint that he wanted “something out of the business”. He did not play a material role in the bribe scheme. The bribe scheme was of Yong’s design, including when the bribes would be paid, how much would be paid, and how the bribe monies would be passed.

74     In my judgment, for the individual offences, the defendant was more culpable than Yong and Ong. That he was the one who had initiated the corrupt scheme was a significant aggravating factor. He was in a trusted position and held in high regard in his company, yet he abused that trust and used his position to obtain the bribes. He was motivated by greed and personal benefit. While his role in the bribe scheme did not appear to be as active as Yong’s, once the scheme was in place, the defendant really did not have to do anything more than to receive the bribes as and when they were paid to him by Yong. While the amounts of gratification in Yong’s charges were higher than the defendant’s corresponding charges, I did not consider the difference to be a significant factor in determining the relative culpability of the defendant and Yong. Yong was remorseful and pleaded guilty; the defendant, on the other hand, had shown no remorse.

75     All in, I accepted the submission of the prosecution that the culpability of the defendant was higher than Yong, and there ought to be an uplift in the sentence. For the first charge where Yong was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment, I considered an uplift to eight months’ imprisonment for the defendant to be appropriate. For the other seven charges, which involved smaller amounts of gratification, the sentence for each charge was calibrated lower according to the amount involved.

#### Global sentence in line with sentencing precedents

76     In deciding on the number of sentences to run consecutively to arrive at the global sentence, I considered the sentencing precedents highlighted by the parties. Some of the more relevant precedents are summarised in the following table.

77     The most relevant sentencing precedent was _Lu Sang_. The offender was an assistant sales manager of a company. Over a period of about four years, he initiated kickback arrangements with three of the company’s suppliers, where he would give job orders to these suppliers and receive monies based on mark-ups that were built into their quotations. The individual kickback amounts ranged from about $1,000 to $23,000, and the offender received a total of $274,666.70. He claimed trial to 24 charges and was convicted. His total sentence was 20 months’ imprisonment. His appeal against his conviction and sentence was dismissed by the High Court.

78     The prosecution submitted that given that the amount in _Lu Sang_ was very close to that in the present matter, the sentence ought not be too far off. The offender in _Lu Sang_ faced more charges, committed his offences over a longer period, and had initiated a kickback arrangement with three separate suppliers. However, the defendant in the present case was in a more senior role than the offender in _Lu Sang_. It was submitted that, on balance, a sentence of at least 18 months’ imprisonment was appropriate, which could be calibrated by ordering three of the eight sentences to run consecutively.

79     I agreed with the submission of the prosecution that, in determining the overall culpability of the defendant to arrive at the total sentence, _Lu Sang_ provided a helpful reference point. The corrupt arrangements in _Lu Sang_, in which each kickback was built into the price, were similar to the present case. The total amount of bribes received in _Lu Sang_ ($274,666.70) was of a similar order to the total amount in the present case ($270,000). Both were cases in which the offender was convicted after a trial. In my judgement, however, the overall culpability of the offender in _Lu Sang_ was substantially higher than the present defendant. In _Lu Sang_, the offences were committed over a much longer period (four years) and involved more suppliers (three), and the offender played a more active role in soliciting the bribes. Therefore, compared with _Lu Sang_, the total sentence of the present defendant ought to be substantially lower. In my judgement, an appropriate global sentence was about 15 months’ imprisonment, arrived at by ordering three individual sentences to run consecutively.

80     In this regard, I did not agree with the submission of the defence that the one-transaction rule applied and that only two sentences should be ordered to run consecutively.[^53] The main basis of the defence’s submission was the court’s finding (based on Yong’s testimony) that there was _one_ prior agreement between the defendant and Yong in respect of the entire bribe scheme, under which all the bribes were paid. In my judgment, the eight bribe payments, which were made over a period of two years, in relation to different purchase orders, could not be considered as part of one transaction. Although the defendant and Yong had an overarching agreement under which Yong would pay bribes to the defendant, each individual bribe was made as a reward for a separate transaction.

#### No inordinate delay warranting a sentencing discount

81     I also did not accept the submission of the defence that the defendant ought to be given a one-third sentencing discount on account of delay in the prosecution of the case. The defence submitted that the defendant was charged in court only on 23 May 2017, after Yong’s matter had concluded. By the time Yong pleaded guilty on 27 October 2015, the investigations against the defendant must have been concluded. Yong’s appeal against his sentence was discontinued on 10 February 2016 and the prosecution could and should have charged the defendant as soon as possible after that. Yet, the prosecution only charged the defendant more than one year and three months after Yong had discontinued his appeal. The defendant had suffered mental anguish, anxiety and distress in having to contend with the intense uncertainty of being subject to CPIB investigations and having the charges hanging over his head.[^54]

82     The prosecution submitted that there had been no inordinate delay. It was explained by the prosecution that the matter involving Yong and MCT was a far-reaching investigation involving more than 21 persons. The investigations initially focused on Yong and the other persons connected to his case. The defendant had been uncooperative with investigations. He completely denied having received _any_ payments from Yong, save for the sum of $6,000. As such, the evidence against the defendant primarily constituted of Yong’s testimony against him. The prosecution could only interview Yong as a witness against the defendant after Yong’s matter (including any appeal) had concluded. Given the defendant’s complete denial of the offences, it was necessary for the CPIB and the prosecution to complete the proceedings in Yong’s matter before dealing with the defendant, so that Yong could be called as a prosecution witness at the trial. There had been no delay since the investigations began into the defendant on 5 May 2013. Given the context of the investigations, it would not justify a discount in sentence.

83     I accepted the submission of the prosecution. I did not find that the lapse of time between the investigation and prosecution of this matter warranted any discount in the sentence. This was a matter of some complexity involving the investigation of many persons. Given that the defendant had denied receiving any bribe monies, it was reasonable for the prosecution to have proceeded against the persons who admitted to their offences and pleaded guilty (like Yong and Ong) before calling on these persons as witnesses against the persons who disputed the charges (like the defendant). The fact that the offenders were prosecuted sequentially did not result in an inordinate delay. Further, the assertion by the defence that the defendant suffered mental anguish, anxiety and distress due to the uncertainty of being subject to investigations and having his charges hanging over his head was not supported by any cogent evidence. No evidence was placed before the court to show that the lapse of time resulted in real injustice or prejudice to the defendant: _Ang Peng Tiam v Singapore Medical Council_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 356</span> at \[109\]. In short, I did not find that there had been any inordinate delay in the prosecution of the matter that warranted a discount in the sentence.

### Sentence imposed
