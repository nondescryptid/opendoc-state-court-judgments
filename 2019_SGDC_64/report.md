\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9071/2019/01 \]

12 April 2019

### District Judge Luke Tan:

## (1)   Introduction

1       The Accused, Soh Eng Luan, is a 38-year-old female Singaporean. She pleaded guilty to four charges (“proceeded charges”), all of which involved SPRING Singapore (“SPRING”) as the victim. Two of the proceeded charges were for offences under s 420 read with s 109 of the Penal Code (“PC”), in that she engaged in conspiracies with one Leong Weng Cheou (“Leong”) to cheat SPRING into disbursing claims for sums of S$5,000 each (“cheating charges”). The remaining two proceeded charges were for offences under s 468 read with s 109 PC, for forging documents that were submitted to support the fraudulent claims (“forgery charges”).

2       In addition, the Accused consented to having eight charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing (“TIC charges”), namely one charge under s 420 read with s 109 PC, and 7 charges under s 468 read with s 109 PC. As a result of the offences set out in the proceeded and TIC charges, SPRING was deceived into disbursing $15,000 arising from a total of three fraudulent claims.

3       The Accused, who is a first offender, was sentenced to 3 months’ imprisonment for each of the four proceeded charges. The two imprisonment sentences for the cheating charges were ordered to run consecutively, with the sentences for the forgery charges running concurrently. The global sentence imposed was 6 months’ imprisonment.

4       The Prosecution, being dissatisfied, has filed an appeal against sentence. I now give the reasons for my decision.

## (2)   The pertinent facts

5       The Prosecution tendered a 6-page Statement of Facts (SOF), which set out the manner in which the offences were carried out. The SOF was admitted to by the Accused without qualification. Its main points are summarised below.

6       In essence, along with the Accused, there were named in the SOF, four co-accused persons involved in different conspiracies to cheat SPRING. They were:

(1)     Leong, who was a was a senior executive at SPRING, a statutory board now known as Enterprise SG;

(2)     Wong Yong Jun Lionel (“Lionel”), a male 35-year-old Singapore citizen;

(3)     Heah Hwee Hoong Mary (“Heah”), a female 41-year-old Singapore citizen; and

(4)     Wong Ping Ling (“Wong”), a female 44-year-old Singapore citizen.

7       As regards the conspiracies to cheat SPRING, the accused persons essentially targeted an Innovation and Capability Voucher (“ICV”) scheme, implemented by SPRING, whereby a $5,000 voucher was given by SPRING to small and medium-sized enterprises (“SMEs”) to encourage them to develop their capabilities in five categories, namely, innovation, productivity, human resource, financial management and solutions. A SME can apply for up to two vouchers in each category, and up to a maximum of eight vouchers. The ICV Scheme is on a reimbursement basis, and operates in the following manner:

(1)     The applicant SME submits its application to obtain SPRING’s approval to buy an item or service (the solution) from a “solution provider”. Each application must be accompanied by (i) a quotation from a solution provider; and (ii) a declaration that the applicant had read the ICV terms (that all information provided in the application was true and that submitted claims are for solutions that had been fully delivered/completed by the solution provider). One SPRING officer assesses each application before another SPRING officer approves it.

(2)     Once approved, the applicant purchases the solution and makes a claim for disbursement of funds to reimburse its purchase. Each claim must be accompanied by (i) an invoice from the solution provider; and (ii) proof of payment to the solution provider. One SPRING officer would assess each claim before the Head of the ICV scheme (Leong’s superior) approves them.

(3)     After SPRING assesses and approves the claim, the applicant submits a hardcopy GIRO form complete with an endorsement from its bank for the disbursement of funds. Thereafter, the disbursement is approved and made by SPRING.

8       The details of the conspiracies that Leong, the Accused and the other co-accused persons were engaged in, with the differing roles of Leong and the Accused highlighted in bold (for comparison), are set out below:

(1)     Leong, whose duties at SPRING included assessing the ICV applications and claims, knew that SPRING would not approve the ICV applications or claims if SPRING knew that the documents submitted were forged, or that the applicant had no business operations, or had not paid the solution providers before making the claims.

(2)     Sometime in 2015, **_Leong devised a plan to defraud SPRING. To carry out the plan, Leong engaged in_** **_four separate conspiracies_** with each of his four friends (the Accused, Lionel, Heah and Wong) to register multiple shell business entities (sole proprietorships) and forge supporting documents for the sole purpose of submitting fictitious ICV applications and claims to obtain the ICV moneys. **_Leong taught his four friends how to register the shell entities_** with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority, which was necessary for the ICV application or claim.

(3)     At the outset, **_Leong explained to his four friends the purpose and process of the ICV scheme_**, and told them that his scheme was fraudulent and that the supporting documents to be submitted for the ICV applications and claims would be forged. He also told them that the applications and claims were for purchases that did not exist. **_Leong promised them that they could get money if they participated in the scheme._** The Accused agreed to participate as she wanted to obtain money for personal expenses, even though she knew that the shell business entities had no business operation at all and never bought any solution.

(4)     Pursuant to his scheme, Leong forged the following supporting documents.

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="41.78%"> <col width="58.22%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Supporting Document</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Purpose</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3 quotations purportedly from solutions providers</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">To deceive SPRING (at the Application stage) into believing that the shell business entities had solicited for and obtained quotations from solutions providers.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3 invoices purportedly from solutions providers</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">To deceive SPRING (at the Claim stage) into believing that the shell business entities had placed orders from solutions providers.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3 receipts purportedly from solutions providers</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">To deceive SPRING (at the Claim stage) into believing that the shell business entities had paid the solutions providers for the solutions bought.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

(5)     In order to carry out the forgeries, **_Leong obtained (from SPRING’s computer systems in the course of his work) genuine supporting documents from existing genuine ICV applications and claims, and fraudulently amended them_**. He did this by saving the genuine documents into his personal hard disk so that he could bring them home and edit them using image editing software on his home laptop. **_He selected documents from solution providers whose documents were neat and tidy_** so that it was easy to edit with the software. **_Leong forged the quotations, invoices and receipts_** by using image editing software to fraudulently amend the name and address of the stated customer to his friend’s details, edit the date, and reference number. He also changed the name of the stated salesperson who managed the sale to a fictitious name. **_Leong then caused those forged documents to be submitted_** to SPRING to apply for and to make the ICV claims. He did this by submitted the applications and claims (with forged supporting documents) **_personally, or through his four friends_**, including the Accused. **_Leong also intentionally selected the fraudulent applications and assessed them favourably_**, so as to increase the likelihood that the fraudulent claims would be approved.

(6)     After SPRING had disbursed funds for a fraudulent claim, **_Leong would split the funds_** equally with the friend who was involved in that claim. **_There were a total of three successful fraudulent claims which the Accused was involved in, which amounted to $15,000 that SPRING was deceived into paying out. She personally received $7,500 out of the said sum._**

(7)     In late 2017, **_Leong gathered the four friends at a law firm_** to talk about returning money to SPRING. After that meeting, **_the Accused lodged a police report, admitting that she had conspired with Leong to cheat SPRING_**.

9       In respect of the four proceeded charges for the Accused:

(1)     Between 17 August 2016 – 31 August 2016, she abetted by engaging in multiple conspiracies with Leong to cheat SPRING, pursuant to which **_three fraudulent ICV claims, as set down below, were submitted to SPRING on 31 August 2016_** to deceive SPRING into believing that the applicant filing the ICV claim, had paid $5,000 for the purchase of a solution, whereby SPRING was dishonestly induced into delivering a total of $15,000 to the business entities registered by the Accused.

(2)     As regards the forgery charges, between 17 August 2016 – 31 August 2016, the Accused abetted by engaging in multiple conspiracies with Leong to commit forgery for the purposes of cheating. Pursuant to the conspiracies, Leong forged two documents, intending that they be used for the purposes of cheating SPRING. The details of the forged documents are set out below:

10     The Accused and her co-accused persons have since jointly made full restitution to SPRING, after investigations commenced.

## (3)   Prosecution’s submissions

11     The prosecutor, DPP Norman Yew, tendered a set of ‘Skeletal Submissions On Sentence’. The DPP asked for a global sentence of at least 10 months’ imprisonment, consisting of at least 5 months’ imprisonment per proceeded charge, with two of the sentences to run consecutively and the two remaining sentences to run concurrently. The essence of the DPP’s submissions are reproduced below.

### (a)   Sentencing Considerations

12     The DPP argued that specific and general deterrence are the main sentencing considerations in the case.

(1)     Specific deterrence is relevant as the Accused’s actions were premeditated since she “…made the decision to engage in the conspiracy to cheat SPRING with consideration. A number of stages in the application and disbursement process had to be followed, with forms to be filled in and submitted at each stage of the proceedings. The accused would have had to maintain his (_sic_) intention to deceive SPRING at each stage of the process.”

(2)     General deterrence is applicable as these are offences that affect public or widely used facilities, and the delivery of financial services (citing _PP v Law Aik Meng_ at \[24(d) and (e)\]).

13     Moreover, the offences in this case were also (i) directed against a public body providing public services, (ii) involved financial services, and (iii) were difficult to detect. They only came to light after the Accused surrendered herself. The deception also involved the delivery of public funds, and where public funds are involved, there is a need to deal with them sternly, since they are directed against the common property of the state (citing _PP v Koh Seah Wee_ , at \[57\])

14     In addition, the DPP argued that the following aggravating factors are present:

(1)     SPRING is a governmental organisation, which provides important support for the development of enterprises and entrepreneurship in Singapore, and the ICV scheme is an important form of support given to small and medium enterprises to develop their capabilities in various work related areas, which in turn, boost Singapore’s business environment and economy. In this case, the Accused had abused the scheme by committing the offences, resulting in SPRING making large payments on false premises to shell business entities. Further, forged supporting documents were submitted to support those fraudulent applications and claims.

(2)     The abuse of the ICV scheme has a detrimental impact, both on SPRING and other legitimate applicants under the ICV scheme. To police the scheme and ensure that the submitted claims are genuine, SPRING has had to expend costs and effort into implementing processes to identify and sieve out fraudulent applications and claims from genuine ones.

(3)     The offences were committed for personal gain, and were planned and premeditated. The Accused also abused the system of registering business entities with ACRA by registering business entities for the purpose of deceiving SPRING. She was an active participant in the conspiracies and personally gained $7,500.

### (b)   Precedent sentences

15     In addition, the Prosecution highlighted that Leong, the mastermind for all the conspiracies, was sentenced to 8 months’ imprisonment per charge, with the sentences for 6 of the charges ordered to run consecutively. This was out of the 30 charges that Leong had pleaded guilty to, namely 12 charges under s 420 r/w s109 PC, and 18 charges under s 468 r/w s 109 PC. Another 105 similar charges were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. In Leong’s case, he was involved in a total of 31 fraudulent claims and personally obtained about $77,500, having masterminded a total loss of about $154,999.63.

16     In its sentencing submissions, the Prosecution also highlighted the case of _PP v Soh Hua Xiang_, DAC 903096/2017 & Ors (_Soh Hua Xiang_). The accused there had faced a total of 201 charges (1 charge under s 420 PC, 10 charges under s 420 r/w s109 PC, 29 charges under s 420 r/w s 116 PC, 4 charges under s 468 PC, and 157 charges under s 468 r/w s 109 PC). The Prosecution proceeded with 12 charges (1 charge under s 420 PC, 10 charges under s 420 r/w s109 PC and 1 charge under s 420 r/w s 116 PC), and the remaining 189 charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. In _Soh Hua Xiang_, the victim was also SPRING, and the accused who, like Leong, was the mastermind of the scheme, was its employee, and worked with his girlfriend, also a SPRING employee, to commit the offences. The period of his offences was from August to October 2015, and SPRING disbursed a total of $55,000 as a result of the offences. In addition, the amount involved for the attempts to cheat SPRING Singapore came up to $145,000. The accused in _Soh Hua Xiang_ was sentenced to 5 months’ imprisonment for the s 420 r/w s. 109 PC charges and 1 month’s imprisonment for the s 420 r/w s. 116 PC charge. Three sentences of 3 months’ imprisonment each were ordered to run consecutively with the other nine sentences ordered to run concurrently. The global sentence was 15 months’ imprisonment.

17     The Prosecution argued that in the present case, the Accused should be sentenced to at least 5 months per charge, taking into account her reduced culpability as compared to the mastermind Leong, for which 8 months’ imprisonment was imposed per charge. This sentence would take into account the fact that full restitution has been jointly made by all the accused persons in this case, and the fact that the Accused had given information on the conspiracy. Also, two of the imprisonment terms must run consecutively, for a sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment, which would reflect the Accused’s total culpability.

## (4)   Mitigation and Defence’s Submissions on Sentence

18     The Defence Counsel, Mr K Bala Chandran, tendered a mitigation plea and a set of submissions on sentence. As regards the bulk of the facts set out by the Defence, these were essentially not disputed by the Prosecution. [\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

19     In the mitigation plea, counsel highlighted the circumstances under which the offences were committed and the Accused had pleaded guilty.

(1)     Counsel stated that it was Leong, an acquaintance of the Accused, who had sought her out at a time when the latter’s husband was experiencing financial difficulties due to his business and gambling habit. Leong had told her that that he was employed at SPRING and was in charge of approving applications under a scheme in which small businesses are given funds to develop their businesses and that she could use these monies to ease her financial position. The Accused was told that if she registered a business, Leong would explain to her how to submit claims to obtain the funding.

(2)     The Accused went along with what Leong had told her, and registered three businesses, and made online application to SPRING for the funding, all of which were actions taught to her by Leong. Even though she became aware that what she was doing was wrong, she went ahead with the submissions online as taught to her by Leong, which submissions were made on 31 August 2016. The Accused subsequently received a total of $15,000.00 in funds from SPRING ($5,000.00 per business) of which she gave to Leong $7,500.00 as agreed between them. **_When Leong subsequently contacted the Accused to register other businesses so as to make further claims with SPRING Singapore, the Accused did not want to participate in the scheme any further._**

(3)     Sometime in late 2017, Leong contacted the Accused to inform her that she had to return the money she had received from SPRING. **_She subsequently sought independent legal advice and confessed to what she had done. She then acted on the advice of her lawyer and made a police report at the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) on 29 November 2017, immediately after being advised to do so._** The police report made by the Accused was attached to the mitigation plea.

(4)      **_From 27 December 2017 onwards, her lawyers started communicating with SPRING on making the refund of the monies received by the Accused_**. Various email correspondences exchanged between the Accused’s lawyers and SPRING were attached to the mitigation plea. A sum of $7,500 was forwarded to SPRING on 14 March 2018. Subsequently, Leong also made restitution of the monies received (from the offences) which the Accused had handed to Leong as his share. Thus, full restitution of the monies for the offences has been made to SPRING.

(5)      **_About a year after her report to CAD, the Accused was charged on 13 December 2018. During this mention, the court was informed of her intention to admit to the charges_**, and a date was subsequently taken for her to plead guilty.

20     In addition, Mr Chandran submitted that the Accused’s culpability was low as she was not conversant with the ICV workflow and processes as she does not run any business and was not familiar with the system and how it operates. Whatever little she knew was told to her by Leong, the mastermind. Moreover, the Accused did not engage in multiple conspiracies and did not know the other co-accused persons (named in the SOF) and had met them only once. **_Further, even though the offences were committed over a short period from 17 August 2016 and 31 August 2016, the actual submission of the claim to SPRING (i.e. the subject matter of all the cheating charges) was made on a single date i.e. 31 August 2016_**[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2). As for the forgery charges, the forgeries were made by Leong himself, sent to the Accused via email, and submitted to SPRING online.

21     Counsel submitted that Leong was the mastermind and had approached the Accused and taken advantage of her naivety. The Accused went along because she needed money due to her husband’s financial circumstances. She was also unaware of how Leong had carried out the forgeries, although she knew that documents were forged when she received them and submitted them online. In addition, when Leong wanted her to make additional claims to SPRING, she refused to participate further because of her guilty conscience.

22     As regards the harm caused, it was pointed out that the Accused made full restitution of the monies received by her, and no loss has been suffered by SPRING. Also, restitution was made voluntary and was done very early on by the Accused, before she was charged.

23     Mr Chandran also highlighted the following other factors in the accused’s favour:

(1)     She is a first offender.

(2)     She herself had gone to the CAD at a very early stage on 29 November 2017 to make a police report of the offences and confessed to her crimes. This was done long before there was any police investigation into the offences. Her voluntary confession had saved both the CAD and SPRING time and effort in investing the matter. Further, the Accused has co-operated fully with police investigations, and made restitution very early on. In any event, contrary to the DPP’s argument, there was no basis to say that the offences were difficult to detect.

(3)     For more than a year, the Accused has been waiting for the case to be proceeded with, and this has been very stressful period for her. Thereafter, the Accused had pleaded guilty to the charges at the very first opportunity. This has saved valuable court time and resources. He emphasised that she is truly remorseful for what she has done.

24     In addition, counsel sought to distinguish the precedent cases put up by the DPP, arguing that the facts there were a lot more aggravating factors. Specifically, the accused person, Leong, and the accused in _Soh Hua Xiang_, were masterminds of their respective schemes. They had also engaged in many more offences and/or more conspiracies with others, and had breached the trust reposed in them as they were employees of SPRING, the victim. The periods of their offences were also significantly longer, and the sums that were involved in their cheating and attempted cheating offences were also much higher than in the cases involving the Accused.

25     Finally, Mr Chandran made reference to two cases, _PP v Sim Chee Kiang_ and _PP v Tan Yu Sheng_ (included in the Prosecution’s table of precedents) which he argued supported his position that the Accused should be sentenced to 1 month’s (or at most 2 months’) imprisonment per charge.

(1)     In essence, the accused persons there were charged for cheating another government agency, the Workforce Development Agency. The period of the offences was longer, as it stretched from January 2016 – April 2016.

(2)     The result of their actions was that both accused persons faced a considerable number of charges of conspiracy to cheat: 18 in the case of Sim, and 22 in the case of Tan. 6 charges were proceeded with against Sim, and 7 charges against Tan. The total amount involved in the offences was $19,780.00, with $8,960.00 being cheated by Sim, and $10,820.00 being cheated by Tan.

(3)     Tan and Sim were each sentenced to 2 months’ imprisonment per proceeded charge. In Sim’s case, 3 out of 6 of the imprisonment sentences were ordered to run consecutively, and for Tan’s case, 4 out of 7 of the imprisonment sentences were consecutive. In Tan’s case, the additional aggravating factor (highlighted by counsel) was that he taught two persons to lie in order to conceal the scam if it came to light.

26     Finally, counsel argued that for the present Accused, she should only be given a short custodial sentence and that only two of the imprisonment sentences should run consecutively. This is in light of the strong mitigating factors in the case, and also to encourage offenders to come forward and to fully co-operate.

## (5)   Sentence by the Court

### (a)   General Approach

27     In the recent case of _Gan Chai Bee Anne v PP_ , at \[18\], Sundaresh Menon CJ re-affirmed that the proper approach to take in determining the aggregate sentence in cases involving multiple offences is that set out in _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ (“_Shouffee_”). His Honour stated:

“….the sentencing judge must begin by deciding the appropriate individual sentence in respect of each charge, and in doing so, he must consider the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors that bear upon the sentence for each charge (at \[26\]). Having done this, the sentencing judge must then consider which of the sentences should run consecutively (at \[27\]). In doing this, he must have due regard to the one-transaction rule and the totality principle (at \[27\] and \[47\])….”

28     In line with the approach of the learned Chief Justice, I will first set out what I consider to be the appropriate sentence for each of the individual charges before deciding on the appropriate global sentence.

29     To reiterate, the Prosecution submitted that a sentence of at least 5 months’ imprisonment per charge is appropriate, and that two of the sentences should run consecutively for a total sentence of at least 10 months’ imprisonment. In contrast, counsel argued for a sentence of 1 - 2 months’ imprisonment per charge, with two sentences running consecutively, for a global sentence of between 2 - 4 months’ imprisonment.

### (b)   Decision on sentence

30     As regards the propositions put forward by the Prosecution to support its sentencing position, I agree that the principle of deterrence should apply in the present case, since the victim is a public body, and the monies cheated were public funds meant specifically to help small and medium sized enterprises. In this regard, it is clear that offences targeting public bodies and public funds should be strongly discouraged. In fact, consistent with this principle and with the precedents cited before me, it appears that that offenders who had engaged in the targeting of public organisations, have received sentences ranging from 2 months’ imprisonment per charge (in _Tan Yu Sheng_ and _Sim Chee Kiang_), to 5 months’ imprisonment per charge (in _Soh Hua Xiang)_, and up to 8 months’ imprisonment (in the case of the mastermind Leong). The difference in sentences imposed in the different cases appear to have been due to considerations such as the role and culpability of the offenders, the amount cheated and harm caused, and various aggravating and mitigating factors specific to the offenders.

31     However, while I agree that the targeting of public organisations and the cheating of public funds are considerations for a deterrent sentence, there were other arguments put forward by the Prosecution, to support the imposition of a deterrence sentence that, with respect, are not clearly supported by the available facts.

(1)     First, as regards the Prosecution’s argument that since the monies cheated were derived from the ICV scheme, this did have a detrimental impact on the legitimate applicants of the scheme, there is no evidence to support this claim. For example, it was not shown that because of what the Accused had done, the fund was so depleted that a legitimate applicant was actually deprived of the equivalent amount of funds a result. In fact, no information was provided of the amount of money made available to the intended beneficiaries of the fund, or that the sum of $15,000 (the subject matter of the three cheating charges including the TIC charges that involved the Accused) actually affected any intended beneficiary. Indeed, if the money set aside for the ICV scheme was adequate, and the bulk of the money had not been disbursed at the time of the offences (by 31 August 2016), or at the time the money was fully paid back to SPRING, it is entirely conceivable that no applicant actually suffered or was disadvantaged as a result of the Accused’s offences.

(2)     It should also be remembered that the Accused is ONLY criminally responsible for the offences that she was involved in. While there were other conspiracies to cheat SPRING, all of which involved Leong and other accused persons, as far as the evidence presented by the Prosecution was concerned, there was nothing to show that the Accused was culpable or had been implicated in connection with those conspiracies which involved other accused persons.

(3)     As for the Prosecution’s argument that the offences were planned and premediated, while I agree that these would generally be aggravating considerations when determining the sentence for an offence, I also note and agree with counsel’s submission that such factors would generally already be inherent in any charge of conspiracy to cheat. This is because every such charge would, by definition and by nature of offence, involve some form of pre-planning or agreement between the participants. However, more importantly on the facts of this case, the planning of the entire scheme was apparently done almost exclusively by Leong, the mastermind, who also apparently directed the entire operation by coming up with the forged documents, sending them to the Accused, and generally instructing her on what to do. Further, as pointed out by the Defence, and apparently not disputed by the Prosecution, there is no evidence that the Accused knew the persons involved in the other conspiracies. Hence her role was relatively small, and her agreement and dealings were apparently only with Leong, and not with the other persons named in the SOF. Nor was she involved with their conspiracies.

(4)     As for the Prosecution’s argument that the offences were difficult to detect, with respect, the Prosecution did not appear to have put forward any evidence to substantiate this claim. Indeed, just because the Accused’s offences were not detected by SPRING, before the Accused confessed and turned herself over to the police, could have been due to a multitude of reasons, especially since there was no actual evidence (only submissions) presented of the effort put in by SPRING to prevent or to detect such offences, before the Accused alerted the authorities. Thus, the lack of detection by SPRING of the Accused’s offences does not _ipso facto_ point to the conclusion that they were actually difficult to detect.

(5)     Further, as stated above, and as set out in the documents put forward by the Prosecution and the Defence, it was actually the Accused who, on her own volition, had obtained legal advice, confessed to her lawyers, made a police report, and then, through her lawyers, liaised with SPRING on making restitution. It thus appears that the remedial action was essentially completely and unilaterally initiated and carried out by the Accused. From the e-mail exchanges between the Accused’s lawyers and representatives of SPRING, SPRING responded on 12 March 2018 with information about how refunds should be made to it. This was after the Accused’s lawyers had informed SPRING (on 27 December 2017) of her intention to return the money.

32     In short, while a deterrent sentence is necessary in the present case because a public body and public funds were involved in the offences, some of the aggravating factors argued by the Prosecution to exist, are not apparent based on the facts presented to the court.

33     Moving on to the evidence before the court, which essentially consisted of the facts in the SOF that were admitted by the Accused without qualification, as well as the information presented by the Defence that was not disputed by the Prosecution, I am of the view that the evidence showed the Accused’s culpability to be relatively low, and that the ultimate harm that she caused to be relatively slight and/or largely mitigated.

34     In this respect, as regards her culpability:

(1)     I am in full agreement with the Defence that the Accused had played a clearly subordinate role in the offences, as she essentially acted upon the instructions of Leong, the mastermind of the scheme and the insider who worked at SPRING. The Accused also did not appear to have done much (if at all anything) on her own initiative, but was essentially a follower who carried out what Leong had told her to do. In fact, consistent with the position put forward by the Defence, and while there was no dispute that the Accused had committed the offences with the requisite mens rea, it appears that Leong had indeed taken advantage of her naivety and her financial plight when he managed to get her involved in the offences. Further, I also note that the Prosecution did not dispute the Defence’s claim that the Accused had little familiarity with the ICV workflow and processes, or that it was essentially Leong who had carried out most of the work connected with the forgery of documents. There was little doubt that the Accused was very much like a worker bee, who flew wherever and whenever, and followed whatever, the queen bee (Leong) directed her to do.

(2)     Moreover, I also note that the Accused’s acts of wrongdoing were largely confined to a relatively short period from 17 August 2016 to 31 August 2016, with the actual submission of the claims to SPRING (the essence of the cheating charges) having taken place on a single day i.e. 31 August 2016.

(3)     Finally, when the Accused was invited by Leong to carry out further acts of cheating SPRING, it is also not disputed that she declined to do so.

35     As for the harm caused by the Accused to SPRING:

(1)     This was in the magnitude of $15,000 for all the charges, of which the actual losses from the proceeded cheating charges was to the tune of $10,000. However, as set out in the SOF and the mitigation plea, full restitution was made to SPRING. In other words, SPRING suffered no monetary loss at the end of the day.

(2)     Further, as regards the gains that the Accused herself made from the offences, all of this money was voluntarily returned to SPRING by the Accused at a relative early date. Indeed, as shown in the email correspondences between the Accused’s lawyers and SPRING (as annexed to the mitigation plea), it was the Defence that apparently took far greater interest and effort in the restitution process.

(3)     Finally, as stated above, there is no evidence of any other harm caused (aside from the money that was eventually returned) to SPRING, or of any actual harm caused to any applicant of the ICV scheme, or of any other detriment caused to any other party.

36     As for the mitigating circumstances of the case, I agree with counsel that there are a considerable number of factors in the Accused’s favour. These include her lack of antecedent, her “whistle-blowing” acts, her full confession to the CAD, her early plea of guilt, and the co-operation that she rendered in the investigation. All in, and together with the restitution that she made to SPRING (as discussed above), the Accused went a considerable way to right the wrong that she had done.

37     Finally, moving on to the precedents relied on by parties, I first note that, unsurprising, neither party advocated that the Accused should receive the same sentence per charge as what was imposed on the mastermind, Leong. Clearly Leong was a lot more culpable, and he was also very much more involved in the scheme to cheat SPRING. Thus, Leong faced eleven times more charges than the Accused, consisting of a total of 135 similar charges (as compared with 12 charges for the Accused), of which a total of 30 charges were proceeded with, and the remaining 105 charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. The harm that Leong caused was also more considerable, with losses totalling about $154,999.63. It was thus of no surprise that Leong was sentenced to 8 months’ imprisonment per charge, with six sentences ordered to run consecutively.

38     However, what was perhaps somewhat unexpected was the fact that the Prosecution asked me to consider another egregious case i.e. that of S_oh Hua Xiang_, and to impose the same 5 months’ imprisonment per charge on the Accused, as was imposed on the accused in _Soh Hua Xiang_. This despite the fact that in _Soh Hua Xiang_, where the victim was also SPRING Singapore, the accused was clearly a lot more culpable than the present Accused, since the accused there was also an employee of SPRING, as well as also the mastermind of the scam, both features shared with the mastermind Leong in the present case. In fact, the accused in _Soh Hua Xiang_ faced even more charges than Leong, namely a total of 201 similar charges. 12 of those charges were proceeded with and the remaining 189 charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. The harm caused by the accused there was also more considerable than in the case of the present Accused, consisting of losses of $55,000 i.e. 3 ½ times more than the losses associated with the Accused’s charges in the present case. Further, in _Soh Hua Xiang_, there was another $145,000 involved in the accused’s attempts to cheat SPRING. In such circumstances, to argue that the same sentence of 5 months’ imprisonment per charge that was imposed on the accused in _Soh Hua Xiang_, should also be imposed on the present Accused was, with the greatest respect, quite inexplicable.

39     In fact, to illustrate the wide disparity in terms of culpability and harm between the cases of Leong, S_oh Hua Xiang_, and that of the present Accused, I have set out the relevant sentencing factors in a table for comparison.

40     In short, in light of the Accused’s relatively low level of culpability, and the relatively low level of harm ultimately caused, as well as the strong mitigating factors in the Accused’s favour (especially the fact that that she was the person who alerted the police to the offences and activity “pushed” to return money to the victim - as compared to the accused persons in the precedent cases), I am of the view that the sentence imposed on the Accused should be significantly less than 5 months’ imprisonment per charge.

41     Nevertheless, taking into account the need for the sentence to reflect a deterrent element in light of the fact that public funds were involved and a public body was targeted, as well as the amount involved in the charges, I am of the view that a sentence of 3 months’ imprisonment per charge is appropriate. While lower than what was imposed on Leong (8 months’ imprisonment per charge), and in the case of S_oh Hua Xiang_ (5 months’ imprisonment per charge), a sentence of 3 months’ imprisonment per charge is higher than the sentence of 2 months’ imprisonment per charge imposed for the accused persons in _Tan Yu Sheng_ and _Sim Chee Kiang[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3)_.

42     Further, in line with the one transaction rule, and the submissions of both the Prosecution and Defence that only two (out of four) sentences should run consecutively, I decided that only the sentences for the two cheating charges (DAC-939986-2018 and DAC-940231-2018), which relate to separate transactions, should run consecutively. The global sentence is thus 6 months’ imprisonment, a sentence which is in line with the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors of the case. The sentence is also proportionate, not crushing, and in accord with the totality principle.

43     The Prosecution, being dissatisfied, filed an appeal against sentence on 1 April 2019. In the meantime, as neither the Prosecution nor the Defence has sought a stay of execution of the sentence, the Accused has been serving her 6 months’ imprisonment sentence since her conviction on 22 March 2019.
