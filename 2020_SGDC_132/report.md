\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9058/2020/01.\]

30 May 2020

### District Judge Tan Jen Tse:

## Introduction

1       The accused, male, aged 31 years old was convicted after trial for an offence of causing grievous hurt (in furtherance of a common intention with two others) to one R Muralithran (“Murali”). The charge read as follows:-

> **DAC-901610-2018**

> \[a\]re charged that you, on 1 March 2017 at or about 1.23 a.m., in the vicinity of Block 198 Punggol Field, Singapore, together with one Mohamed Rashid Bin Mohamed Ayub and one Yusri Bin Mohamed Ayub, and in furtherance of the common intention of you all, did voluntarily cause grievous hurt to one R Muralithran, _to wit_, by punching and kicking the said R Muralithran’s head and face, causing him to sustain multiple facial fractures, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 325 read with section 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

2       The accused was sentenced to 20 months’ imprisonment. He has filed an appeal against conviction, but has not appealed against sentence.

3       Mohamed Rashid bin Mohamed Ayub (“Rashid”) and Yusri bin Mohamed Ayub (“Yusri”) who were named in the charge, were tried together with the accused at the same trial for corresponding common intention charges. They were convicted of the charges they faced. Rashid was sentenced to 20 months’ imprisonment, while Yusri was sentenced to 22 months’ imprisonment. Neither of them has filed an appeal against conviction or sentence.

4       In addition, Rashid was also convicted at trial for an offence under s 267(B) of the Penal Code for fighting with Murali at about 10.00 p.m. on 28 February 2017. He was sentenced to pay a fine of $4,000, in default to two weeks’ imprisonment.

## BACKGROUND FACTS

5       On the evening of 28 February 2017, Rashid and Yusri arranged to meet at a coffeeshop at Block 198 Punggol Field (“the coffeeshop”). Yusri arrived first with his wife while Rashid arrived sometime after 9 p.m.. They ordered and consumed some beer.

6       When they arrived, Murali’s group was already there. He was with a large group of friends at a nearby table, celebrating a birthday. Among the group who were present at the end of the evening were:-

> (a)     Murali (PW3);

> (b)     Davindran s/o Supramaniam (“Davindran”) (PW1);

> (c)     Sudesh Kumar s/o Malivaganam (“Sudesh”) (PW4);

> (d)     Kannan s/o VR Sivalingam (“Kannan”) (PW5); and

> (e)     Asokan s/o Kathikeyan (“Asokan”) (PW6).

> (collectively, “the five men”).

7       At about 10.00 p.m., Rashid got into a fight with Murali in the vicinity of the coffeeshop after some friction developed. However, once they were separated and the fighting stopped, they carried on drinking with their friends. Both Rashid and Murali sustained visible facial injuries as a result of their fight. Rashid suffered injuries to his face and lips while Murali had a cut near his left eye. Murali was charged for fighting with Rashid in MAC 913134 of 2017. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to pay a fine of $4,000.

8       Sometime after the fight between Rashid and Murali, Yusri’s wife left for home, while Yusri remained at the coffeeshop. The accused arrived sometime around midnight on his motorcycle and joined Rashid and Yusri. He noticed that Rashid had cuts to the area of his lips.

9       Shortly after the accused arrived, some members of Murali’s party left the coffeeshop. According to Davindran, the four people who left were one Mohan and his family, which comprised his wife, daughter and his baby granddaughter. While the accused agreed that some people from Murali’s group left after he arrived, he claimed that the ones who left were male, one of whom was intoxicated. However, nothing turns on this.

10     In any event, the two groups sat in relative peace until the five men left the coffeeshop sometime after 1 a.m. on 1 March 2017. Murali carried with him a bottle of beer which had not been consumed. They proceeded to Davindran’s car which was parked nearby and got into it.

11     It was not in dispute that the accused also left the coffeeshop and approached Davindran’s car as he was reversing out. The accused claimed that he did so as he heard vulgarities being uttered by the other group and wanted to clarify matters with them. The accused tapped on the window of the car. Davindran testified that when he wound down the window, the accused punched him in his face, a fact which the accused disputed. There was also an exchange of words between Davindran and the accused, after which the five men in the car alighted. Rashid and Yusri had in the meantime also left the coffeeshop and approached the car shortly after the accused did so.

12     When Murali got out of the car, he was still holding on to the bottle of beer which he had brought with him from the coffeeshop. At this juncture, trouble erupted. It was not in dispute that the accused and Rashid confronted Murali about holding the bottle of beer. The accused then went to his motorcycle, got his helmet and threatened Murali with it. An assault on Murali then ensued.

13     It cannot now be disputed that Rashid and Yusri had attacked Murali and that Murali suffered grievous hurt. The prosecution alleged that the accused also joined in the attack. The accused denied having any common intention with Rashid and Yusri to assault Murali. Instead, he claimed that he had attempted to stop the assault.

14     During the course of the assault, Davindran went to the boot of his car to get a golf club. He used the golf club to assault the accused. He was charged for an offence under s 323 of the Penal Code in DAC 945923 of 2017. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to pay a fine of $3,500.

15     At about 1.23 a.m. on 1 March 2017, police received a call from a male caller to report on the incident (Exhibit P1).

### Medical reports

16     After he was injured, Murali was conveyed to Changi General Hospital (“CGH”). He decided to leave instead of waiting for treatment. He went to Hougang Polyclinic later that morning. According to the medical report (Exhibit P6), Murali claimed to have been punched in the forehead and subsequently lost consciousness. Clinically, there were bruises over his eyes with a large left sided periorbital haematoma and sub-conjunctival haemorrhage. The range of motion of his temporal mandibular joint was reduced. He was referred to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (“TTSH”) for follow up.

17     Murali was warded at TTSH from 1 March 2017 to 3 March 2017. From TTSH’s medical report (Exhibit P7), a CT scan showed that he had multiple facial fractures. He was referred to the Eye and Plastic surgery team for assessment. The diagnosis made was _Minor Head Injury consistent with a History of Trauma_.

18     There was no dispute that Murali had sustained grievous hurt within the meaning of s 320 of the PC.

## The Prosecution’s Case

19     The main prosecution witnesses were the five men.

### Evidence of Murali (PW3)

20     Murali testified that when his group left the coffeeshop, he was holding on to an unopened bottle of stout which they could not finish. He went to Davindran’s car and sat at the rear left passenger seat, next to the door. When Davindran had reversed a very short distance, he saw and heard the accused knocking on the driver’s side window. Davindran wound down his window and Murali heard a loud sound. Davindran exclaimed, “Hey, the fellow punched me”. The five men got out of the vehicle.[^1] Davindran then spoke to the accused.

21     Murali noticed Rashid, Yusri and another male Malay coming towards him. They confronted him as to why he was holding a bottle. Rashid, Yusri and the male Malay then attacked him by punching him. The accused also came over and joined the group. The accused confronted him and asked, “Why you got problem with my friend, uh?” The accused then went to a motorcycle and got a helmet from the top of the seat. The accused threatened to hit him but did not.[^2]

22     The accused, Rashid and Yusri continued to pound him. Murali backpedalled to get away from the attack but lost his grip of the bottle. He recalled seeing a golf club being swung towards his face, but did not see who was wielding the club. He fell to the floor and was in a lot of pain. He could feel that he was getting kicked and hit on his leg, face and body and he covered his face. He thought that he was being hit by a metal stick and that a helmet hit his hand. He heard someone say in Malay, “You --- you run away today --- we --- your friend sure die, we kill him.”[^3]

23     The next thing Murali realized was that the police and ambulance had arrived. He estimated that the assault lasted ten to fifteen minutes. He was conveyed by ambulance to CGH, but he left on his own accord as he felt cold. As he could not take the pain, he sought treatment at Hougang Polyclinic the next morning and also at TTSH. He stated that many bones in his face were fractured and that he lost four teeth. He was placed on two months’ medical leave. [^4]

### Evidence of Davindran (PW1)

24     Davindran gave evidence that after the five men left the coffeeshop, they went to his car. He reversed his car for about six to seven metres when he saw the accused, Rashid and Yusri approaching. The accused beckoned him to stop by raising his hand. When Davindran wound down the window, the accused asked him, “Your --- your friend fight with my friend, huh, just now?” Davindran told him, “They already fight one to one, finish already.” The accused punched him in his face straightaway. Davindran pulled his handbrake and noticed that Rashid and Yusri were to the left side of the car where Murali was seated.[^5]

25     Everyone got out of the car and there was a bit of pushing, shoving and noise. Murali, Rashid and Yusri got into a fight, but Davindran did not notice what the accused was doing. Rashid was on the ground using his hands to punch Murali. Yusri was also attacking Murali. Davindran saw someone holding a helmet, but could not recall who. Sudesh went to intervene and got into a scuffle with Rashid.[^6]

26     Davindran then went to get his golf club from his car. He used it to hit the accused once on the side of his face as he was attacking Sudesh. Rashid and the accused then turned towards him and attacked him. Davindran fell to his knees and they punched him in his head. They pulled on the golf club and managed to dispossess him of it. He then ran to the centre of the road. He heard Rashid say in Malay, “You run, uh, you see I give your friend die.” He also saw someone use the golf club to hit Murali on his face, but could not tell who had done so. He then called the police.[^7]

### Evidence of Sudesh (PW4)

27     Sudesh stated that he arrived at the coffeeshop at about 12.20 a.m.. He was a driver by occupation and his intention was to speak to Mohan, who owned a transport company. He did not consume any alcohol that night. [^8]

28     After they left the coffeeshop, Sudesh sat at the front passenger seat of Davindran’s car. While they were slowly reversing, the accused approached their vehicle and knocked on the driver’s window. When Davindran wound down the window, the accused asked, “Did you have any misunderstanding with my friend earlier?” Davindran responded, “Well, it’s all over now.” The accused did not say anything but straightaway punched Davindran’s face. The rest of them then got out to stop the fight.[^9]

29     When Sudesh got out of the car, he noticed Yusri and Rashid coming forward. He then noticed “the three of them” approaching Murali. Rashid and the accused told Murali to put down the bottle he was holding, while Yusri approached Murali from the side. Sudesh tried to get between Murali and them to prevent any fight. Rashid wanted to approach Murali, but Sudesh blocked him to prevent him from going forward. Rashid got angry with him and pulled his shirt. Both of them fell to the ground and struggled with each other for two to three minutes.[^10]

30     When he got up, Sudesh saw Yusri using a golf club to hit Murali who was lying on the ground. He and Davindran then tried to distance themselves and went to the centre divider of the road. Davindran called for the police. Sudesh saw Yusri using the golf club to hit Murali who was covering his face. Rashid was just standing there. Sudesh thought that the accused was standing there as well but did not know if he hit Murali. Yusri stopped hitting Murali when the police came.[^11]

### Evidence of Kannan (PW5)

31     Kannan testified that he had gone to the coffeeshop to discuss some temple related matters with his friends and for a birthday celebration.

32     When he left with the others, he sat in the middle of the rear seat of Davindran’s car. He saw the accused, Rashid and Yusri approaching the car. The accused went to the driver’s window and knocked on it. When Davindran wound down the window, the accused asked, “Earlier, who is the one finding trouble with my friend?” Davindran replied, “It’s already settled.” The accused then threw a punch at Davindran’s face and all of them got out of the car.[^12]

33     When the other men and he got out of the car, they tried to stop the three accused persons from approaching the car. However, they were aggressive. All of them spotted Murali and wanted to go after him. He felt that there was going to be a big fight. He walked away and managed to hail a taxi to bring him home.[^13]

### Evidence of Asokan (PW6)

34     Asokan testified that when they left the coffeeshop, he sat at the rear right seat of Davindran’s car, directly behind the driver. He witnessed the accused knocking on the window of the car. Davindran wound down the window and the accused asked, “Just now what happened between you and my friend?” Davindran explained, “All settled already, what, nothing.” Straightaway, the accused punched Davindran. As Davindran was not able to reverse, all of them got out of the car to try to resolve the issue amicably.[^14]

35     Asokan testified that Davindran said, “Already settled, then why you’re like that?” Then a scuffle started. Like Kannan, he walked away from the scene, but stopped some distance away to observe what was happening. He saw Rashid, Yusri and the accused attacking Murali. All three of them were using their fists and legs. He also saw someone carrying a helmet but could not see who it was. He then went to the toilet and returned about 5 minutes later. He saw them using a helmet to assault Murali. Murali was lying on his back, unconscious. A short while later, a police car arrived. He gave his statement to the police and then left the scene.[^15]

## The Case for the defence

### The accused’s evidence

36     The accused testified that on 28 February 2017, Rashid called him at about 9.00 p.m. and asked to meet for drinks and to catch up at the coffeeshop. He arrived by motorcycle at about 12.00 a.m. to 12.15 a.m. on 1 March 2017, having been delayed by work. He did not know that Yusri would be there. He noticed that both Rashid and Yusri had been drinking and that they were quite slow in their speech. He sat beside Rashid and noticed there were cuts in the area of his lips. When he enquired, Rashid said that he had a dispute with the people sitting at the other table. He took a glance at them. When probed further, Rashid did not respond and the accused assumed the dispute was over.[^16]

37     After about 30 to 45 minutes, the accused noticed that four to five men from the other group left with another man who was drunk. About 10 to 15 minutes later, the rest of the group left. As they were leaving, someone from the group shouted what sounded to him like “Fuck you mother”. He was not sure of what he heard, but became “quite upset”. He went towards the car which was reversing and gestured for it to stop.[^17]

38     The accused testified that he approached Davindran’s car to clarify what the remarks were about, who they were referring to and why they made the remarks. He also wanted an apology. He felt that their remarks were not acceptable as he was brought up by his mother and abusive language about mothers was a sensitive topic to him. The accused further testified that he walked fast towards the car and approached aggressively.[^18]

39     When he reached the car, he went to the driver’s window and knocked on it. When Davindran wound down the window, the accused asked him what the remarks were about, but Davindran did not respond. The five men then got out of the car. The accused denied punching Davindran. He then saw Rashid approaching and going towards Murali who was at the left passenger door. He noticed Murali holding a black beer bottle. He went to Rashid, pulled his left arm and told him “enough” and to stop. Yusri also came, wrapped his forearm around Rashid’s neck and pulled him from behind. Sudesh stood between Murali and them. Rashid and Murali were arguing and that was when the accused learnt that Rashid’s earlier dispute was with Murali.[^19]

40     Murali held the beer bottle by its neck at around the level of his waist. The accused shouted at him, “If you want to talk, you put down the bottle then we talk.” As Murali did not respond positively, the accused went to his motorcycle which was parked nearby, picked up his helmet, lifted it up and shouted at Murali that if he was going hit anyone with the beer bottle, that he would hit Murali with his helmet.[^20]

41     At this juncture, Rashid ran towards Murali and pushed him towards the grass patch near the entrance of the car park, where there was also a stop sign. Murali managed to flee. Sudesh followed Rashid. The accused also followed Rashid as he wanted to stop him. Sudesh managed to block Rashid by bear-hugging him. The accused was also in the vicinity. Rashid managed to break free and went towards Murali. Both Yusri and Rashid attacked Murali who dropped the bottle of beer. Rashid and Murali then engaged in a fist fight and the accused saw one of Rashid’s punches landing on Murali’s face.[^21]

42     Murali ran to the road, fell down and started rolling and groaning. Rashid then ran towards Murali and kicked and stomped on him. The accused was stunned and ran towards Rashid to try to pull him away. He also told him to stop and that it was enough. When the accused was trying to pull Rashid away, Yusri joined in and started to attack Murali. The accused shouted at Yusri to stop as Murali was already bleeding.[^22]

43     The next thing the accused knew was that he was hit on his head by a golf club. He turned around and pushed Davindran in his chest with both hands. Together with Yusri, he tried to retrieve the golf club from Davindran. Yusri managed to get hold of the golf club. The accused stated that during the scuffle with Davindran he may have hit him unintentionally. Davindran and Sudesh than ran across the road. Yusri took the golf club, whacked it on the road and shouted at Davindran and Sudesh, “What kind of friends are you? Leaving your… friend behind.” He did not see if the club hit Murali.[^23]

44     The accused was at a loss as to what to do and walked to his motorcycle. He also started to feel pain in his head. He saw Yusri asking Rashid to stop hitting Murali. It did not cross his mind to call the police as he was in pain and was not thinking. Yusri then shouted to him to get some water, and the accused went to the coffeneshop to do so. They lifted Murali, carried him to the side of the road, placed him at some bollards and washed his face. Rashid came over and punched Murali. The accused was disgusted, pulled Rashid away and told him, “Do you want him to die then you will stop” or words to that effect. The police arrived and ambulance arrived shortly after.[^24]

## The issues

45     The main issue was whether the accused had participated with Rashid and Yusri in the attack on Murali.

## Evaluation of evidence

### No evidence to show that the accused was called as a reinforcement

46     The Prosecution contended that the accused was specifically called to the coffeeshop to engage the other group as a reinforcement.[^25] Davindran claimed that he sensed trouble when the accused joined the other table. He therefore sent Mohan and his family on their way.[^26] Davindran’s claim was supported by the others in his group who were called as prosecution witnesses.[^27]

47     In my assessment, there was no evidential basis to support the Prosecution’s position, which was based solely on the suspicions of Davindran and the others in his group. Further, although they claimed that they sensed trouble and wanted to leave quickly, they lingered on for a considerable amount of time. During this time, the two groups sat in relative peace for over an hour and did not create any trouble. The more plausible account was forwarded by the defence i.e. that Rashid invited the accused for drinks and to catch up.

### The accused approached Davindran’s car aggressively

48     When the five men left the coffeeshop, the accused approached Davindan’s car. While the prosecution’s case was that his intention was to stop the car, so that Rashid, Yusri and he could proceed to assault Murali as planned, I was not prepared to draw any inference that this was so.

49     The prosecution alleged that the accused punched Davindran in the face after Davindran wound down his car window. The accused was not charged for such an offence, and it was not necessary to come to a finding on this issue as it was not directly relevant to the charge the accused faced. Suffice to say, the accused was clearly angry and upset and had gone to confront the five men.

50     The accused claimed that he approached the car as he heard someone utter what he thought sounded like, “fuck your mother”. In cross-examination, he also admitted that he also intended to confront them on behalf of Rashid as well. He had seen Rashid frowning and he believed Rashid to be angry.[^28] As he was not sure whether the remarks were directed at him or who they were directed towards, he wanted to seek clarification from the five men and to demand an apology from them. It was difficult to see what the accused hoped to achieve by this or why he could not let the remarks pass. He was clearly in an aggressive state of mind and was out to look for trouble by confronting the five men.

51     The accused admitted that he was quite upset and approached the car aggressively. By his own account, he could easily be riled up even when he was unsure of what he heard and who the insult was directed at. It showed that he acted impulsively in deciding to confront the five men. He was clearly not in control of his emotions and was in a hostile state of mind.[^29] His evidence was notably lacking in how he managed to suddenly transform into a supposed peacemaker and was not credible. As will be seen below, the accused continued to act aggressively and to spoil for trouble.

### The accused held Rashid back only because he saw Murali holding a beer bottle

52     It was not in dispute that after the accused confronted them, the five men got out of the car and Rashid and Yusri approached the left side of the car where Murali was standing. While there was a dispute as to how far behind the accused they were, this was not material since the accused joined them at the left side of the car soon after.

53     The accused testified that when he saw Rashid going towards Murali, he noticed that Murali was holding on to a beer bottle. He then went over to Rashid and pulled his left arm to prevent him from going forwards, while Yusri restrained Rashid by wrapping his forearm around Rahid’s neck.[^30] His testimony was supported by Sudesh who agreed under cross-examination that the accused was trying to move Rashid away from Murali. [^31] Sudesh clarified in cross-examination that the accused had done so as Murali had a bottle in his hands.[^32]

54     It was clear from the accused’s evidence that he pulled Rashid’s arm because he saw Murali holding on to a bottle. He stated that after the five men got out of the car:-[^33]

> Q    Please tell us what happened after that.

> A    Then I --- I saw Rashid coming towards us, uh, but he was going towards, um, the man standing at the left back passenger door.

> \[Murali identified\]

> Q    Go on, go on.

> A    Okay, Uh then, uh, when I knew that he was going towards, uh, Murali, I noticed that Murali was holding onto a beer bottle. And then, um, I went to Rashid and then, I --- I pull his left arm and told him enough, told him to stop.

55     In a similar vein, while Rashid did not testify that the accused had pulled his arm, he stated that his brother pulled him back and said, “Hey, he got bottle, you crazy or what? Don’t lah.”[^34] Yusri had agreed when cross-examined by defence counsel that when he saw Murali holding on to the bottle, he was scared for Rashid. He further agreed with the accused’s position that he held Rashid back as he noticed that Murali was holding a bottle and did not want Rashid to go near him.[^35]

56     The thrust of the evidence was therefore that the accused held Rashid back as he was concerned that Murali was holding a bottle rather than out of a desire to prevent an assault. In fact, the accused proceeded to escalate the matter by continuing to engage with Murali, even though Murali did nothing to threaten them.

### Murali was not holding the bottle of beer in an aggressive manner nor was he intending to use it as a weapon

57     Murali testified that when he came out of the car, he was still carrying the bottle of beer which the group did not consume. He did so absent-mindedly and only realised this when someone asked him, “You take the bottle wanna hammer?”[^36] It was not put to Murali that he had threatened to use the beer bottle as a weapon. His evidence in cross-examination that he was “not the kind of person to hit somebody with a beer bottle” went unchallenged by defence counsel. Although he did not put down the beer bottle when the accused shouted at him to do so, this did not show that he intended to use the bottle as a weapon.

58     The prosecution failed to adduce detailed evidence as to how Murali held on to the bottle. However, according to the accused, when Murali stepped out of the car, he was holding the neck of the bottle. The bottle was upright with the top of the bottle around Murali’s waist area.[^37] The accused did not assert in his testimony that Murali held the bottle threateningly or that he threatened to use the bottle as a weapon. When issue was taken over the beer bottle, it was clear that the accused’s group was making Murali a target.

### The accused threatened to hit Murali with a helmet and brought the helmet into the fray

59     Even though Murali was not holding the bottle in an aggressive manner nor was he threatening to use it, the accused, Rashid and Yusri directed their attention towards him. According to Murali, they questioned him as to why he was holding the bottle and whether it was to “hammer” them.[^38] The accused admitted that he shouted at Murali, “If you want to talk, you put down the bottle then we talk.”[^39] As Murali had not threatened to use the bottle or indicated that he wanted talk, this ultimatum was unreasonable and totally uncalled for. It must be construed as a challenge on Murali and an escalation of the matter by the accused.

60     What was patently clear was that the accused continued to act aggressively and proceeded to further escalate the matter. He went to his motorcycle, which was parked on the pavement several metres from Davindran’s car. At this stage, he could have disengaged from the altercation and remained there. He could even have ridden away. Instead, the accused took his helmet, lifted it up and shouted at Murali that if he were to use the bottle, he would hit Murali with his helmet. This was not a peace making gesture but a threat and a display of aggression. It showed that the accused was still very much engaged, that he was prepared to enter the fray and even escalate the matter with the use of his helmet as a weapon.

61     The accused did not state what he did with the helmet after he threatened Murali with it. While Yusri testified that the accused had put it back on his motorcycle, the accused did not testify as such. Instead, it was more likely that the accused brought the helmet into the fray as a weapon. Murali testified that when he was on the ground covering his face, he could feel a helmet hitting his hand.[^40] Asokan also gave evidence that he saw someone using a helmet to assault Murali, but did not see who it was.[^41] In the absence of evidence that anyone else had a helmet, it would be reasonable to infer that the helmet used in the assault belonged to the accused.

### Credible evidence to show that the accused shared a common intention to punch and kick Murali

#### General issues

62     The main prosecution witnesses were the five men. The accused admitted that they had no reason to falsely implicate him.[^42] As their evidence resulted in Rashid and Yusri being convicted at the same trial, the prosecution’s evidence was reliable with respect to the cases against them. While four of the five men had been drinking, it was not submitted that this made their evidence less credible.

#### The testimonies of Davindran, Sudesh and Kannan had little probative value

63     A scrutiny of the evidence of Davindran, Sudesh and Kannan showed that their evidence had to be treated carefully and that ultimately, little weight could be placed on their evidence.

64     Although the prosecution submitted that weight should be placed on Davindran’s evidence, his evidence lacked specificity and contained little detail on the role the accused played in the attack on Murali. He admitted that his memory was poor. While I did not think that he set out to be untruthful, the quality of his evidence was wanting.

65     As pointed out by the defence, Davindran failed to specifically state in his examination-in-chief that he saw the accused kick and punch Murali. He only testified that the accused was involved in a fight, but could not really remember who he fought with. It was also difficult to determine what Davindran actually witnessed about the attack as much of his evidence was given in speculative terms or appeared to be a rationalisation of events.[^43] As an example, his testimony that the accused was attacking and not stopping the attack was based on his thinking that if the accused’s intention was to the stop it, he would not have started it in the first place.[^44] This was an assumption and a rationalisation of events which was not based on what he witnessed.

66     Davindran was also hesitant when it came to the issue of whether the accused had assaulted Murali. The tenor of his evidence can be illustrated in cross-examination when he stated:-[^45]

He kicked --- he kicked him. Because he was on the floor. I know the few of them kicking him. There were only 3 of them. So, they were kicking.

All 3 were kicking together, that’s what you saw?

 |

A

 | 

Turn by turn. Not all 3.

67     This is an illustration of the internal inconsistency in his evidence relating to whether the accused kicked Murali. It was also a rationalisation as Davindran only thought that the accused kicked Murali. His evidence also had a speculative element as he later stated in cross-examination that “… when somebody is on the floor, you tend to kick only”.[^46] Finally, while his evidence was that the accused had punched and kicked Murali, he had in re-examination stated that, “I saw Angelo kicking. I can’t remember much on his punching now.”[^47]

68     In view of the quality of Davindran’s evidence relating to the accused’s role, I attributed little weight to it. However, there was also nothing in his evidence that exonerated the accused.

69     Sudesh’s evidence was of little value to the prosecution with respect to the accused’s involvement. He did not notice what the accused did and his evidence did not implicate the accused. He observed that at a specific point, the accused just stood there, but was unsure if he had hit Murali.[^48] Nor did it support the defence since Sudesh testified that he did not see the accused trying to stop the attack.[^49] Although he agreed in cross-examination that the accused had tried to move Rashid away from Murali, he clarified in re-examination that this was at the initial stage when Rashid had first tried to approach Murali.[^50]

70     Kannan left the scene soon after the five men got out of the car. He did not shed any light on the accused’s role in the attack on Murali. He saw the accused, Rashid and Yusri going after Murali but did not see what occurred.[^51] However, before he left the scene, he noticed that the three of them were very aggressive and wanted to attack Murali. His evidence indicated that the accused was still in an aggressive mood. However, since he did not witness how Murali was assaulted, his evidence was of little corroborative value on the issue of the assault.

#### Murali’s evidence was credible

71     There were some aspects of Murali’s evidence which were not consistent with the objective facts.[^52] He testified that apart from the accused, Rashid and Yusri, another male Malay also attacked him. No such fourth attacker existed. However, I did not regard this as a material discrepancy, since the key issue was whether the accused attacked Murali, and not whether a fourth person did so. Another inconsistency which arose was that Murali denied that he was asked to put the bottle down, whereas the established evidence showed that the accused and Rashid asked him to do so. While the defence asserted that Murali lied about this, there was no reason for him to do so since the accused did not allege that he had threatened to use the bottle as a weapon.[^53]

72     The defence submitted that Murali was unclear and nebulous over the accused’s role.[^54] Issue was taken as to whether the accused had swung the helmet at him and threatened to hit him with it, since this was only said in cross-examination. The defence therefore submitted that Murali had exaggerated the accused’s act of lifting the helmet. I could not agree with this submission. It was undisputed that the accused had gone to his motorcycle to fetch his helmet. Contrary to what the defence claimed Murali did state in examination-in-chief that the accused went to his motorcycle, took his helmet which was on top of the seat and threatened to hit him.[^55] Davindran and Asokan corroborated Murali’s evidence as they had also seen the swinging motion of the helmet. When the accused was holding on to his helmet and threatening Murali, it would be natural for him to swing the helmet instead of keeping it perfectly still.

73     Since the accused was holding on to his helmet, he would have stood out from the rest. It would have been easier for Murali to identify him as one of the attackers who moved forward and punched him. I did not accept the defence contention that if the accused was holding his helmet, he could not have punched Murali since these were not mutually exclusive events. He could have still done so by for example, using his free hand to punch Murali.

74     In my assessment, Murali was a witness who was intent on giving a true account of what occurred as he remembered it. He did not seek to embellish his evidence or fill in the gaps on material issues. He was candid and testified truthfully that when he was on the ground, he did not see who hit him with a golf club, who used a helmet on him, and who kicked and punched him. If he wanted to frame the accused, he could have easily testified that the accused had attacked him when he was on the ground.

#### Asokan corroborated the evidence of Murali

75     The main support for Murali’s evidence came from Asokan. When trouble flared up, he had the presence of mind to leave the scene and observe the events from a distance. His testimony that he saw the accused, Rashid and Yusri attacking Murali with their fists and legs supported Murali’s account that the accused was among the attackers. His observation that someone was carrying a helmet was consistent with the factual matrix, as the accused had gone to his motorcycle to get a helmet so that he could threaten Murali with it. Asokan also saw someone use a helmet to hit Murali, which was also consistent with Murali’s evidence on this.

76     The defence submitted that Asokan’s evidence was internally inconsistent.[^56] It was contended that while Asokan claimed that the attackers used their fists and legs on Murali, he stated in cross-examination that he only saw “scuffling.” This was factually incorrect. As can be seen in the passage below, he did in fact use the word in his examination-in-chief. Further, from my reading of his evidence, Asokan used the word “scuffling” to mean that Murali had been attacked. He did not as the defence suggested, use it to denote something less than that. Asokan had stated in examination-in-chief:-[^57]

> Q    Yes, a few more questions about \[what\] you observed before you went to the toilet, okay? Besides Mr Angelo, was there anyone else?

> A    The three of them were involved in the fight. They were scuffling around the road, and the thing went right to the main road.

> Q    So to be clear, you mean Angelo, Yusri and Rashid?

> A    Yes.

> Q    So when you say the scuffle started, how did you see this scuffle start?

> A    They start attacking Murali. That’s what I saw, and then they went to the main road, lah. By the time --- at that time --- at that time --- point of time I already went to the toilet, you see.

> Q    And when you say the men went to the main road, out of the three of them, how many went to the main road?

> A    The three of them were there at the main road when Murali --- they attacked Murali and he lie down on the road, Sir.

77     This illustrates that Asokan used words such as “scuffle”, “fight” and “attack” interchangeably. While his evidence may have been externally inconsistent as to the location of the attack which occurred near the stop sign,[^58] I did not think that this inconsistency affected the veracity of his evidence as to who had carried out the attack.

78     The defence also submitted that Asokan’s evidence that he saw “a few’ of them punching and kicking Murali who was lying on the road was inconsistent with his earlier evidence that all three attacked Murali. It was submitted that there were serious doubts about the accused’s participation.[^59] This submission was without merit. As was the case for his use of the word “scuffling”, Asokan’s use of the phrase “a few of them” was also imprecise. It implied that there were multiple attackers. He consistently maintained that one of the attackers was the accused.

79     The defence also contended that Asokan’s ability to observe events were severely compromised as he was standing some distance from where the assault took place and as his observation only lasted a few seconds. Moreover, visibility may not have been very good as a crowd was blocking his view. It was also contended that Asokan had only seen “movements” and not the actual punches and kicks. It was therefore dangerous to rely on his evidence.[^60]

80     While Asokan may not have been able to observe every detail, he testified that he could see the punches and kicks. His evidence that he saw movement did not mean that he did not see the punches and kicks as suggested by the defence. He used the word “movement” to describe the motion when a punch was thrown or a kick was executed.[^61] This was consistent with his evidence that he saw punches and kicks. Although he may not have seen actual contact with Murali, this was not material as he was able to see the motion of punches and kicks being executed. Since the accused had punched and kicked Murali, he must have joined in the attack on him.

81     In my assessment, Asokan was an honest witness who testified as to what he saw to the best of his recollection. He readily admitted when he did not see something or did not witness events clearly. He had stated in his examination-in-chief that a helmet had been used on Murali.[^62] While he presumed that Murali had been hit with a helmet as the helmet had been swung, Asokan was candid in cross-examination when he stated that he did not see the helmet come into contact with Murali, but saw the helmet being lifted up.[^63]

82     Having considered Asokan’s evidence, I found him to be a credible witness. He had withdrawn early from the fray. While there may have been some external and internal inconsistencies in his evidence, they were not material. His testimony was generally reliable on material issues. He was clear that all three attackers, including the accused had hit Murali, although the action was fast.[^64] He was sure that the accused was not trying to stop the fight by pulling Rashid or Yusri away. He explained that “when you pull away means you separate --- ” but that he did not see any separation.[^65] This was logical and credible.

### Accused’s claim that he intended to stop the attack was not credible

83     In his defence, the accused denied kicking and punching Murali. Instead, he claimed that he had attempted to stop the fight on several occasions. Ae enumerated by the prosecution, the occasions were as follows:-[^66]

> (a)     When Rashid first went towards Murali;

> (b)     When Rashid chased Murali towards the stop sign at the entrance of the car park;

> (c)     When Murali fell on the road and Rashid kicked and stomped on him;

> (d)     When Yusri attacked Murali thereafter; and

> (e)     When Rashid punched Murali at the bollards.

84     The claim that he tried to stop the attack was a bare assertion, unsupported by any credible evidence. The accused gave evidence in a rather truncated way. His evidence lacked detail and was devoid of texture and nuance on this issue. No details were provided on issues which could have made his account more convincing such as what he actually did and why he was ultimately unsuccessful in preventing Murali from being grievously hurt. His evidence was by and large unsupported by other witnesses. Rashid did not support the accused’s case at all, and it was noteworthy that defence counsel did not broach on this subject with Rashid. While his evidence in court mirrored his statements to the police, I was of the view that his statements were self-serving and that weight could not be attributed them.

85     The accused testified that the first time he tried to prevent the attack, he held Rashid by the arm while Yusri held Rashid by his neck. I had found at \[54\]-\[56\] that they did this because they saw Murali holding a bottle. Shortly before this incident, the accused had aggressively approached Davindran’s car. He was clearly incensed by what he thought he heard and acted impulsively. His evidence provided no insight as to why and how he suddenly calmed down to play the peacemaker. His account of what occurred lacked details such as how Rashid responded, whether Rashid struggled, what was said between them and why he decided to let go of Rashid’s arm. No explanation was provided as to why he could not, together with Yusri, usher Rashid away to diffuse the situation. The fact that the accused went to get his helmet so that he could threaten Murali with it showed that he did not intend to disengage from the altercation or diffuse the situation, but that he wanted to escalate it.

86     The accused next claimed that when Rashid forced Murali towards the grass patch at the entrance of the car park where there was a stop sign, he followed Rashid as he wanted to stop him.[^67] However, a review of his evidence showed that he did nothing at all to carry out his claimed intention. Further, by his own account, Sudesh stopped Rashid by bear hugging him. Still the accused did nothing to help Sudesh to stop Rashid’s advance nor did he say anything to Rashid.[^68]

87     According to the accused, Rashid managed to break away from Sudesh and went towards Murali who was standing near the stop sign of the car park.[^69] Together with Yusri, Rashid attacked Murali who dropped the bottle. Murali and Rashid had a fist fight and Murali ran onto the road, fell down and started groaning and rolling. There was no suggestion that the accused did anything to prevent the attack on Murali, although he had ample opportunity to do so.

88     For the third occasion when the accused claimed to have tried to stop the attack, he testified that after Murali fell, Rashid went towards Murali and kicked and stomped on him. The accused went to Rashid and tried to pull him away. He told Rashid to “stop, enough already.” This was a bare claim as no details were provided as to what happened when he tried to pull Rashid away, what was said or why the attack on the accused continued. His claim was not supported by Rashid or Yusri or any other prosecution witnesses. In fact, Yusri’s evidence was to the effect that the accused did not tell Rashid to stop.

89     For the fourth occasion, the accused claimed to have shouted at Yusri to stop his attack as Murali was already bleeding.[^70] Once again the accused failed to provide any details as to what he tried to do. His evidence was not supported by either Rashid or Yusri. Yusri had specifically denied that the accused had done so.[^71] It should also be noted that while Yusri stated that the accused had tried to pull him back at an earlier stage of the attack, no weight could be attributed to this, as the accused did not claim that he did so.

90     The last time the accused alleged that he tried to stop the attack was when he and Yusri claimed to have helped Murali to the side of the road and placed him against the bollards. The accused testified that Rashid came over and punched Murali. The accused pulled Murali away and told him to stop.[^72] This account went unsupported and Yusri had in fact denied that this incident occurred at all.[^73] While the accused claimed that he helped Murali by getting water, this did not indicate that he did not participate in the attack. By his account it was Yusri (who had undoubtedly participated) who asked him to fetch water.

91     Considering the evidence as a whole, I did not find the accused’s evidence to be credible. No reasonable doubt existed in his favour. He had acted aggressively over a trivial matter and it was most unlikely that he had gathered himself to become a peacemaker. His actions instead demonstrated that he wanted to escalate matters rather than to calm things down. In view of the above, the accused’s claim that he did not participate in the attack, but had tried to stop it was not credible.

## CONCLUSION

92     As the accused had jointly attacked Murali with Rashid and Yusri, there was no doubt that a common intention existed. Because of the nature of the attack, the accused must have known that it was likely that grievous hurt would be caused to Murali.

93     Taking into account the totality of the evidence, I found that the prosecution had established beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty of the offence. The accused was accordingly convicted.
