Damages – Assessment

14 May 2021 - Judgment reserved.

### Deputy Registrar Chua Wei Yuan:

## Brief facts

1       This is an assessment of damages (“AD”).

2       On 17 Dec 2010, the plaintiff (“P”) (a male navy serviceman, then aged 41) was injured in an accident. Both P and the defendant (“D”) were riding motorcycles. P was riding on the extreme left lane when D came from P’s right side, and attempted to turn left at a junction ahead of both of them. This resulted in P colliding into D’s left side, falling off, and suffering injuries for which he now sues.

3       P commenced proceedings in April 2011 and, in May 2011, interlocutory judgment (“IJ”) was entered for 100% of damages to be assessed.

4       At the AD be me, the following persons testified:

> (a)     P;

> (b)     P’s wife;

> (c)     LTC Alan Tan, P’s superior for the period 2011–2017;

> (d)     Dr Kannan Kaliyaperumal, P’s orthopaedic specialist; and

> (e)     Dr Chang Wei Chun, D’s orthopaedic specialist.

5       In closing, P claimed the following heads of damages. P’s and D’s final submissions, and my decision thereon, are as follows:

## General damages for pain and suffering

6       As a general point, I will adjust the awards posited in the _Guidelines_ upwards by approximately 15% to account for inflation in the 10 years since the _Guidelines_ were published.

### Left foot/ankle injuries

7       P seeks damages of $65,000.00 for pain and suffering for his left foot injury, comprising:

> (a)     $45,000.00 for the foot/ankle injury generally;

> (b)     $10,000.00 for post-traumatic osteoarthritis in the left foot and ankle; and

> (c)     $10,000.00 for permanent scarring/discolouration of the left foot.

8       D, on the other hand, submits that $20,000.00 is a fair and reasonable assessment.[^1]

9       I award P:

> (a)     $48,000.00 for the comminuted navicular fracture, (including actual foot post-traumatic osteoarthritis and the risk of ankle post-traumatic osteoarthritis); and

> (b)     $8,000.00 for the scarring.

#### Medical evidence

##### (1)   A broad account of P’s injuries

10     In relation to the foot injury, P claims he suffered the following:

> (a)     comminuted fracture of the left navicular bone with displacement and intra-articular step;

> (b)     periarticular soft tissue swelling over the left ankle;

> (c)     tenderness and swelling over medial aspect of the left foot;

> (d)     left foot post-injury scarring (with permanent soft tissue scarring, muscle loss, sensory deficit and cosmetic deformity);

> (e)     post-traumatic (osteo)arthritis of the talonavicular (“**TN**”) joint and left foot; and

> (f)     risk of post-traumatic osteoarthritis to the left ankle.

11     P presented to the emergency department with tenderness and swelling over the medial aspect of his left foot. An X-ray showed that P had a navicular fracture (which turned out to be comminuted). This would eventually lead to treatment which broadly included 7 surgeries by the time of the AD, medication/injections, and physiotherapy.

12     P’s first surgery was scheduled on 6 January 2011, or about 2 weeks post-accident. It involved an open reduction and internal fixation of the navicular fracture and a debridement of the callus, for which P was hospitalised 3 days. On 11 February 2011, or about 1 month later, P underwent a second surgery, a wound debridement and excision of the stitch sinus abscess, further to a superficial wound infection.

13     P’s fracture had healed[^2] (_ie_, united)[^3] by mid-May 2011. However, in September 2011, P complained of persistent aching, difficulty running, and an irritable talonavicular joint.[^4] His permanent disability was assessed at 9%.

14     Through a CT scan in May 2012, P was found to have mild hallux valgus in his left big toe, with degenerative changes of the 1st metatarsophalangeal joint. Among the observations was a bony deformity of the navicular and a small bony defect of about 2mm at the lateral aspect of the navicular, extending to the articular surfaces. The TN joint had narrowed with irregularity of the articular surfaces, osteophytes and subchondral sclerosis, which the radiologist concluded was likely due to osteoarthritis of the TN joint, and might need further action.

15     In August 2012, P still complained of persistent pain, which Dr David Su—then one of his treating physicians—concluded was likely due to osteoarthritis of the TN joint. He recommended a removal of the implants and fusion of the joint. Even so, Dr Su thought that this would not completely remove P’s residual disability, and that P would have difficulty working due to restricted movement. P was, in early October 2012, excused prolong standing and walking for 6 months pending investigations as to the cause of his pain.[^5] (In April 2013, P was then excused restrictive footwear.)[^6]

16     On 25 October 2012, P underwent his third surgery, a left foot hallus surgery to correct prominent medical eminence of the left big toe; and a removal of the navicular screws. On 1 December 2012, P underwent a fourth surgery for multiple sinus excision, wound debridement, and drainage of the abscess, further to a wound infection.

17     In early 2013, Dr Su ordered P to undergo physiotherapy.

18     In May 2013, P continued complaining of TN joint pain. The podiatrist found discomfort upon both static and dynamic weight bearing, which was exacerbated by uneven terrain and unsuitable footwear. There was also reduced sensory perception in the first 3 toes. The podiatrist suggested lifelong use of custom orthotics and a silicone bunion pad to stabilise the feet and manage the pain.

19     In August 2013, Dr Chang examined P, who reported chronic pain in his left foot, aggravated by carrying loads or standing/walking for over 1 hour. At this point in time, he was taking pain medication on and off. Dr Chang examined P to have a very stiff foot. P’s dorsiflexion was 0–10°/0–20°, plantar flexion was 0–25°/0–45°, with zero inversion and eversion (which should be 25° and 20° usually). P’s left foot had slightly reduced (_ie_, 4/5) power, with loss of sensation over the dorsal area of the 1st and 2nd toes. Dr Chang—who turned out to have the most optimistic opinion—thought that P might not be able to resume shipboard duties, and would have difficulty walking on uneven terrain. At this point, P started to complain of lower back pain, which (as I discuss later) I find to be secondary to the poor gait that the injury left P with.

20     Through 2014, P continued to complain of severe pain on the medial aspect of the left foot. This was thought to be secondary to neural damage or trauma. A repeat CT scan now showed both TN and cuneonavicular (“**CN**”) degenerative changes.[^7] By late 2014, P had sleep difficulties. The fusion surgery that had been contemplated was postponed to deal with P’s psychiatric issues.

21     In February 2015, P had his fifth surgery, a fusion of the TN and CN joints subsequent to developing arthritis of the TN joint. As the fusion went into non-union, P underwent a sixth surgery in July 2015 to repair the fusion with plates, screws and a bone graft.

22     P continued to report pain in 2016. He walked with a limp, and was unable to walk for more than 20 minutes without left midfoot and forefoot pain and swelling, or climb more than 5–6 steps without unbearable pain. He was also unable to squat fully or pivot on his left foot. P also experienced sudden, sharp, debilitating pains. The range of motion of P’s foot remained equally restricted, save for plantar flexion, which marginally improved to 0–30°. The dorsum of P’s left foot was also numb; the doctors thought this was due to P’s extensive surgeries. His left leg thigh and calf muscles had wasted by 2 and 2.5cm respectively, and his ankle and foot were weak (_ie_, 4/5 power). P’s pain was expected to subside to manageable levels over the next 2–3 years. P’s skin cosmetic deformity and scarring were assessed to be permanent. By this time, P had developed extensive post-traumatic midfoot arthritis and secondary arthritis of adjacent midfoot joints.

23     As a result of P’s sustained pain, P underwent a seventh surgery in April 2018 to remove his surgical implants. However, a broken screw end was left behind in the medial cuneiform bone as the doctors thought it would do more harm than good to remove it. This operation was, however, complicated by post-operative wound infection. Upon examination, P was found to have very poor balance on his left leg, and wasting of his left quadriceps and calf muscles at 1cm each. At this stage, P was taking injections more frequently to manage the pain. At the first tranche of the AD, P arrived late as he had sought medical attention for discharge coming out of his wound.

24     Even as at 2019, P complained of constant and significant pain and swelling, made worse in cold environments. P was unable to walk barefoot on most occasion, and could not wear covered shoes, and there was numbness or hypersensitivity at times, with a constant feeling of imbalance. By this time, P started to complain of right knee pain (as a result of P shifting his weight to his right leg). P’s left foot had also atrophied somewhat.

25     P was in total prescribed some 1,620 days of medical leave from the accident to 29 Jun 2018,[^8] including the following major tranches of medical leave:

> (a)     105 days at the first instance (_ie_, up to 7 weeks after the 2nd surgery), with 3 months’ excuse from physical activity thereafter;

> (b)     188 days after the 3rd surgery (_ie_, up to 5 months after the 4th surgery);

> (c)     355 days after the 5th surgery (_ie_, up to 6 months after the 6th surgery);

> (d)     424 days in June 2016–July 2017;

> (e)     439 days from August 2017 to October 2018; and

> (f)     90 days from November 2018 to February 2019.

26     In summary, I find that P also suffered the following residual disabilities:

> (a)     diminished sensation over the anteromedial aspect of the left foot where incisions were;

> (b)     patchy areas of hypersensitivity on certain areas of the dorsum foot;

> (c)     warmth and swelling over the scar region;

> (d)     permanent operation scars over the dorsum foot — medial foot (8cm); dorsum foot (5cm); and midfoot bony prominence (2cm × 2cm);

> (e)     markedly reduced left ankle dorsiflexion, plantar movement, and supination, and zero inversion/eversion;

> (f)     slight wasting of left calf muscles;

> (g)     abnormal gait;

> (h)     inability to do single limb push-off, squat fully with heels on the ground, or carry heavy loads; and

> (i)     difficulty with climbing stairs, prolonged walking/standing, and sleeping (due to pain).

27     P’s wife also gave unchallenged affidavit evidence that, during the 3–6 month period after each operation, P could not move around unaided, and she would have to transfer him between the wheelchair and the bed, toilet or chair (as the case may be). P would also need help with basic activities like changing clothes, showering, toileting and grooming. P’s leg injury had also affected the couple’s sex life which, prior to the accident, was normal.

##### (2)   Disputed features of the injury

28     I turn to a few aspects of P’s complaints which D disputed were (or would likely be) caused by the accident.

(i)   Post-traumatic osteoarthritis

(A)    _FOOT_

29     Parties broadly agree that P has developed post-traumatic osteoarthritis of the left foot.

30     D disputes that this will be serious enough to require surgery. However, I disagree. Suffice it to say that I consider P’s foot osteoarthritis serious enough to require future surgery. I address this in more detail under the claim for future medical expenses.

(b)    _Ankle_

31     The other point of dispute is whether P is likely to develop post-traumatic osteoarthritis of the left _ankle_.

32     D argues that there should not be compensation for post-traumatic osteoarthritis of the left ankle, since the left ankle was not injured or fractured in the accident, and the evidence of possible osteoarthritis was speculative.[^9]

33     I reject this submission.

34     I leave aside P’s submissions that Dr Kannan’s evidence be preferred on the bases that he sub-specialises in foot and ankle surgery whereas Dr Chang is a general orthopaedic surgeon; that he was the last doctor to see P; and that his opinion was cogent as he clearly demonstrated that there were multiple contributors that would continually affect P for the rest of his life.[^10] Dr Chang has also performed 50 ankle surgeries over a long career—a number I find not insubstantial, and Dr Chang had in fact seen P slightly more recently; and Dr Chang’s opinion was also apparently founded not only in principle but in clinical observations. I turn to the lines of analysis which inform my decision.

35      **First**, D argued that Dr Kannan’s opinion—on which P relies—was not shared by other doctors.[^11] However, D’s point is not quite proven by the excerpt from the cross-examination on which D relies:

> Q:    You say it is unlikely to result in **osteoarthritis** to ankle?

> A:    To ankle, correct.

> …

> Q:    See 5PDB920, ankle surgery, 1st – 2nd para. Agree?

> A:    No. We are talking about ankle joint now. Nothing wrong present with ankle joint – it has never been injured. Radiologically, clinically nothing wrong. Dr. Kannan is saying: because of foot stiffness, it increases strain to ankle, and it can cause all these things in PBD920 – I agree there is extra strain, but think **these consequences** are totally speculative, because ankle was pristine.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

In relation to the **_second_** question, the “consequences” which Dr Chang says are totally speculative is not ankle osteoarthritis, but specific signs requiring surgical intervention. The question was not posed in reference to an assessment that P would suffer osteoarthritis; it was posed in reference to Dr Kannan’s recommendation for an arthroscopic left ankle debridement, on the basis that P would need scar tissue shaved down, and synovial adhesions cleared from the ankle. In relation to the **_first_** question, the questions immediately preceding that systematically drew Dr Chang’s attention to the various paragraphs in his own 28 March 2019 report relating to his assessment of what P should expect in future. The question immediately before had drawn Dr Chang’s attention to the paragraph reproduced below. D’s counsel asked if there was osteoarthritis of the joints, despite fusion, and Dr Chang replied “yes” in relation to the foot joints.[^12] It was in that context that Dr Chang was then asked whether it was unlikely to result in osteoarthritis to the ankle. The exchange was as follows:

> Q:    Moving on.

>> **5PBD909, para 4, sub para 1, last sub-sub para**:

>>> \[_Though there may be increased stress to the ankle joint from the stiff foot, it is unlikely to result in_ **_osteoarthritis of the ankle to need surgical procedures, such as arthroscopic joint debridement_**_._ \[emphasis added in bold\]\]

>> Agree, there is osteoarthritis of joint, despite fusion?

> A:    Foot joints, yes.

> Q:    You say it is unlikely to result in osteoarthritis to ankle?

> A:    To ankle, correct.

Given the context in which the question was posed, I find it unsafe to read the question as an absolute one, independent of the report. Instead, it is more fairly read as confirming what Dr Chang had written and, at most, an opinion that it was unlikely to result in osteoarthritis so severe it would require surgical procedures like joint debridement.

36      **Second**, saying that osteoarthritis to the ankle of any sort would be speculative seems to squarely contradict his own 2016 report, in which he agreed with A/Prof Singh that, due to additional stress to the intertarsal and remaining midtarsal joints (_ie_, subtalar and calcaneocuboid joints), he would be more than 50% likely to become arthritic in the next 20 years (_ie_, by 2035), and the “arthritis, also in more than 50%, likely to be severe” \[_sic_\], in which case P would require fusion of the entire foot.[^13] It also contradicts the 28 March 2019 report, insofar as Dr Chang said that there is a high chance the midtarsal, subtalar and intertarsal joints would become arthritic due to the fusion.[^14] These statements are significant since the subtalar joint is one of the ankle joints.

37      **Third**, as a matter of principle, and of patient examination, I find it more likely than not that the arthritis will progress to the hindfoot where the ankle is.

> (a)     I accept P’s submission that Dr Kannan had listed multiple contributors that would continually affect P for the rest of his life.[^15] Dr Kannan reasoned that there was clinical and radiological evidence of accelerated post-traumatic osteoarthritis in the left foot and prolonged weight-bearing (_eg_, manual job or sports) would hasten this process, and that P’s subjective symptoms and physical findings pointed to ankle involvement, which meant increased loading on the ankle that would lead to degenerative changes in the ankle.[^16]

> (b)     While Dr Chang observed that the ankle joint was pristine,[^17] it is of little assistance to D because it was also given in the context of whether P would eventually require surgery. Predicting, based on a pristine ankle joint, that P would not have osteoarthritis serious enough to require surgery is _not_ the same as predicting that P will not have osteoarthritis at all for the next 17 years (_ie_, from 2019–2035). Dr Kannan noted, also in early 2019, that P’s ankle remained tender; its range of motion had decreased since the last consultation;[^18] and even in 2016 (_ie_, almost 6 years post-accident) had noted that the secondary arthritis of the foot had progressed to other midfoot joints apart from the fused TC/CN joints.[^19]

(ii)   Degeneration of cuneonavicular joint

38     D submits that any issue concerning the degenerated CN joint should be excluded as part of the damages for pain and suffering, on the basis that the CN joint had degenerated by 2014 (as seen in the CT and bone scans) and that the degeneration of the CN joint was not part of P’s case.[^20]

39     I reject this submission.

40      **First**, insofar as this concerns a pleading point, the issues relating to the CN joint are in my judgment part and parcel of the principal injury, _ie_, the comminuted fracture of the navicular bone.

> (a)     The diagram submitted by D in closing, reproduced below, shows that while the CN joint is not the same as the TN joint, they are on either side of the fractured navicular bone. This is obvious from the common “-navicular” suffix in both terms, and confirmed by Dr Chang’s evidence.[^21]

> (b)     I accept P’s submission that the degeneration happened precisely because of the accident, and that it led to osteoarthritis and thereafter the need for TN/CN fusion in 2015. In fact, Dr Kannan had even gone further to find extensive post-traumatic midfoot arthritis secondary to the fracture, and secondary osteoarthritis of adjacent midfoot joints apart from fused joints.[^22]

41      **Second**, I also agree with P that D’s theory was neither supported by Dr Chang nor put to Dr Kannan.[^23]

(iii)   Pain/decreased sensation in big toe

42     D submits that pain/decreased sensation over the left big toe are to be excluded from the assessment.[^24]

43     I agree. While P states that P has accepted all along that the bony deformity has not caused the injuries in P’s closing submissions para 2.1.2 (as stated at \[7\] above),[^25] the point is that P has alleged in P’s closing submissions para 2.1.4(k) that he has suffered diminished toe strength (_ie_, this was listed among the residual disabilities at \[26\]). P does not reply to this and, considering the tenor of P’s reply submissions, I find that the diminished toe strength/sensation does not arise from the accident.

#### Approach to assessment

44     D submits that the global sum for the foot injury would include the onset of osteoarthritis to the TN joint and CRPS, since sub-itemisation risks overlaps and thus overcompensation.[^26] However, _Lua Bee Kiang (administrator of the estate of Chew Kong Seng, deceased) v Yeo Chee Siong_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 SLR 145</span> (CA) (“_Lua Bee Kiang_”) has since clarified at \[9\]–\[23\] that the component-by-component and global methods of assessing damages are complementary rather than mutually exclusive. The component-by-component method of assessment conduces to transparent reasoning, and the attendant risk of overcompensation is addressed by considering if the global award is reasonable and neither excessive nor inadequate. This exercise, in particular, is guided by precedent and by avoid overlapping injuries which (a) together result in pain that would not have been differentially felt by the claimant or (b) together give rise to only a single disability.

45     As regards CRPS, D submits that it is wrong to characterise P’s chronic pain as a psychiatric injury or condition that attracts a separate award, since this leads to overcompensation.[^27] However, in my view, this runs contrary to the guidelines.[^28] CRPS is a distinct diagnostic entity in psychiatry and, historically, it has more often than not been the subject of a separate award. More fundamentally, the diagnosis was made precisely because of pain disproportionate to what is expected of the injury and treatment. I therefore find the contrary to be true, that is, to subsume the award for chronic pain under the injury is to risk trivialising P’s suffering and undercompensating P. I will therefore consider the CRPS award separately.

46     The risk of osteoarthritis has sometimes been the subject of a separate award. In principle, it could fairly be considered a distinct loss for which a separate award may be provided. However, I find it inappropriate in this case to make a separate award because the 5th, 6th and 7th surgeries which P underwent were highlighted as sequelae of P’s foot injury but were, in fact, consequences of osteoarthritis to P’s foot (more specifically, the TN/CN joints). The medical evidence on the foot injury and osteoarthritis is intertwined, such that it seems to me that making a separate award would risk double compensation far more than it would clarify my reasoning.

47     D also submits that I should exclude “Scars are separately provided as an item of its own”.[^29] It is not entirely clear what D means by this, as D does not actually make a separate submission for scars. If D means that scars ought to be the subject of a separate award, I treat D as having no submission in reply to P’s submission. If D however means that a separate award ought _not_ to be made for scars, I reject this submission as scars almost always attract a separate award even if they are part and parcel of an injury and cannot be said to be differentially felt by the claimant. In fact, the court in _Alam Jahangir v Mega Metal Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 148</span>, having considered _Lua Bee Kiang_, made a separate award for scars.

#### Overall quantum

##### (1)   Foot/ankle injury and osteoarthritis (or risk thereof)

48     In relation to foot injuries, the _Guidelines_ posit as follows at Ch 7:

>   
| 

**E.**

**…**

 | 

**FOOT**

 | 

 |
| 

**(a)**

 | 

**Amputation of both feet**

 | 

$130,000–$160,000

 |
| 

**(b)**

 | 

**Amputation of one foot**

 | 

$60,000–$75,000

 |
| 

**(c)**

 | 

**Very severe**

Such cases include severe crushing injuries of the foot or a partial amputation either of the forefoot or the heel such that the injured person will have much difficulty walking without a walking aid. There is permanent and severe pain, gross restriction of movement, very limited flexibility and scarring.

 | 

$30,000–$45,000

 |
| 

**(d)**

 | 

**Severe**

Fractures of both heels/both feet with substantial restriction on mobility and permanent pain. Recovery is difficult and limited.

 | 

$25,000–$30,000

 |
| 

**(e)**

 | 

**Serious**

Cases in this category include significant damage to both feet requiring multiple operations with some needing fusion of foot joints and long-term treatment. However, there is significant recovery although residual disabilities remain on a long-term basis with a significant risk of osteoarthritis.

 | 

$15,000–$25,000

 |
| 

**(f)**

 | 

**Moderate**

Complicated metatarsal fractures resulting in malunion and permanent deformity. There is some restriction of movement and flexibility and there is also a risk of osteoarthritis developing in the future. The person’s ability to find employment matching his pre-trauma capacity is reduced and his participation in sports may also be limited.

 | 

$8,000–$15,000

 |
| 

**(g)**

 | 

**Mild**

Simple metatarsal fractures, ruptured ligaments with complete or near complete recovery. There may be continuing symptoms, such as permanent limping (slight), pain or ache, but these are mild and unlikely to affect a person’s chances of finding employment although his participation in strenuous sporting activities may be limited.

 | 

$2,000–$8,000

(Generally, $2,000 for fracture of one metatarsal discounting for overlap for two or more such fractures.)

 |

  
  

49     In my view, P’s injury _prima facie_ appears, as D submits,[^30] to fall into the “serious” category. However, generally speaking, I consider that P’s injury had such a protracted recovery process that he should be awarded considerably more than what the “serious” category provides. In this regard, P submits that, at the minimum, P’s injuries lie at the lowest end of the “very severe” category, given the complexity of the fracture, number of operations, permanent scarring and discolouration, gross deformities, and permanent condition.[^31] D argues that the “very severe” category does not apply as P did not suffer a severe crush injury, have a partial amputation, or need a walking aid.[^32] I do not entirely agree with D. In _Mei Yue Lan Margaret v Raffles City (Pte) Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 4 SLR(R) 740</span> (HC) (“_Margaret Mei_”),[^33] Woo Bih Li J, in upholding a $100,000.00 global award for a deep, traumatic right ankle laceration, observed at \[54\] that the plaintiff had endured more severe and prolonged pain and suffering than an amputee’s even if her injuries were not life-threatening.[^34] This principle was applied by Vinodh Coomaraswamy J in _Ng Chee Wee v Tan Chin Seng_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGHC 54</span> (“_Ng Chee Wee_”) at \[51\]–\[52\]. Similarly, in _Rahman Lutfar v Scanpile Constructors Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 41</span> (“_Rahman_”), Aedit Abdullah JC (as he then was) noted at \[32\] that the level of pain and suffering for limb injuries not requiring amputation would not always be several magnitudes lower, and could come very close to that of injuries requiring amputation, if sufficiently serious and debilitating.[^35]. In my view, D’s argument—that this case is irrelevant because it does not involve the same kinds of injuries[^36]—misses the point. These cases illustrate the principle that a plaintiff may receive more damages than is usually awarded for a more serious injury, if despite the apparently less serious injury he endures more severe and prolonged pain and suffering than he would have endured with an apparently more serious injury. To put it even more generally, the categories are porous rather than closed, and that the quality of the of injury, treatment/recovery, and residual disability is indicative rather than conclusive of the damages. The _ultimate_ inquiry is still a plaintiff’s _pain and suffering_.

50     I first discuss 4 cases which D cites.

51     In _Li Xue Wen v China Construction (South Pacific) Development Co Pte Ltd and Another_ (DC Suit 840 of 2003),[^37] the plaintiff was involved in an industrial accident in which a metal object hit his right foot and caused a navicular fracture. He was initially treated with a cast and rest, but upon follow-up complained that the pain in his foot affected his gait. He underwent surgery to remove an accessory navicular bone. His post-operative recovery was uneventful, and he was placed on physiotherapy and hospitalisation leave for some 8 months. He had a 5cm surgical scar, with residual mild tenderness over the navicular bone and a mild antalgic gait. His ankle range of motion was slightly limited. The plaintiff was awarded $8,000.00. In _Ganesan A/L Govindaraj v Ravi A/L Mariappen and another_ (Suit 460 of 2008),[^38] the plaintiff suffered navicular bone and big toe proximal phalanx fractures. This left him with limited ankle and toe range of motion, and a bump at the CN joint (without instability). The plaintiff was awarded $10,000.00 for these 2 injuries. The case file suggests, however, that the plaintiff was not treated for these injuries. (The emergency surgeries carried out were for other, more serious injuries: an open fracture of the left tibia and a closed comminuted fracture of the right tibia and fibula.) I agree with P that, while the body part and nature of injury was similar, the injuries were far less serious in these cases and the recovery far less complicated. In neither case did the plaintiff suffer a comminuted fracture and accelerated post-traumatic osteoarthritis, or require multiple surgeries over several years.[^39]

52     In _Hong Eng Fuat v Liang Sing Kuang and another_ (DC Suit 3630 of 1997), the plaintiff suffered a foot fracture-dislocation and a 4th metatarsal fracture, for which he was awarded $12,000.00. D highlights that this was treated with manipulation and reduction, and insertion of Kirshner wires, which left the plaintiff with a 4cm surgical scar over the dorsum of the left foot. The plaintiff was left with foot pain and stiffness that was likely to be permanent, and could not walk beyond 500m, and had difficulty squatting. In _Har Hong Wai (formerly known as Har Har Wee) v Tan Kim Chung_ (Suit No 457 of 2009) (“_Har Wong Wai_”),[^40] the plaintiff suffered a lisfranc fracture-dislocation of the 2nd tarsometatarsal joint with post-traumatic arthritis, and was treated with screw fixation and implant removal, with annual reviews for the next 5 years. The plaintiff had restricted ankle, big and second toe range of motion, with no eversion and dorsiflexion. He could only walk or stand for about 2–3 hours, with foot swelling/numbness upon prolonged standing. He had to use the heel to bear weight, and could not run, jump or climb stairs. The plaintiff was awarded $18,000.00. However, the point here is the same as that above: the plaintiffs here underwent a limited number of surgeries,[^41] and these cases are too different from the present case in terms of severity to make a meaningful comparison beyond the obvious conclusion that the award in this case should be considerably higher.

53     P cites 3 other decisions.

54     In _Ng Chee Wee_, the plaintiff suffered a foot degloving injury, and underwent a flap procedure which was unsuccessful and infected, and required a further skin graft surgery. The plaintiff was awarded $95,000.00. In _Tan Shi Lin v Poh Che Thiam_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 219</span>, the plaintiff suffered a foot degloving injury, for which Lai Siu Chiu SJ awarded $90,000.00. The plaintiff also suffered a near-amputation of the big toe (which had to be amputated after an unsuccessful revascularisation), and open dislocation of the second toe interphalangeal joint (which was also amputated). The plaintiff underwent multiple surgeries, suffered permanent residual pain, and could no longer engage in physical activities. In _Rahman_, the plaintiff suffered a right leg above-knee amputation, and a crush injury of the left leg (involving an ankle and toe fracture, the tearing of skin off the foot (_ie_, degloving), and knee pain). This required removal of dead tissue and managing the infections, and left the plaintiff with residual pain and mobility issues. Aedit Abdullah JC awarded $80,000.00 for the amputation, $50,000.00 for the crush injury, and $13,000.00 for the increased risk of osteoarthritis to the left knee and ankle.

55     Where _Ng Chee Wee_ and _Tan Shi Lin_ are concerned, I agree with D’s argument that these cases are unhelpful,[^42] although this is not so much because they suffered different injuries, but because the awards there are too far away with P’s submission to make a meaningful comparison with the present case.

56     That said, I find _Rahman_ to be a somewhat more helpful reference for the foot injury. The injury in _Rahman_ was considerably more extensive, but the complications in P’s treatment and P’s residual disabilities makes his pain and suffering comparable to that of the plaintiff in _Rahman_, and P has accounted for the differences by seeking a lower amount in compensation. Considering that an inflation-adjusted award in _Rahman_ should be about $52,000.00, I find P’s submission of $45,000.00 not unfair for the foot injury.

57     I do _not_, however, find _Rahman_ helpful where osteoarthritis is concerned. _Rahman_ involved a plaintiff whose other leg suffered an above-knee amputation, and he had to rely on his remaining (and already injured) leg to get around, such that it would degenerate faster. In this case, P still has the use of his right leg. P submits that his chance of ankle osteoarthritis setting in is almost 100%,[^43] but that was Dr Kannan’s 2016 opinion, which was not shared by other doctors. Dr Chang pointed out that the ankle joint remained pristine in 2019 (_ie_, after nearly 2.5 years), which suggests that arthritis has not set in yet. I find it difficult to accept that the risk of osteoarthritis is nearly 100%. Most separate (and inflation-adjusted) awards were in the range of $2,000–$3,300 for _potential_ osteoarthritis (see, _eg_, _Tan Yong Heng Jeffrey v Tay Kiah Por_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] SGHC 278</span>; _Chua Ser Kenon v Karuppiah Jai Sankar and another_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 127</span>) and $3,000–$6,500 for _actual_ osteoarthritis (see, _eg_, _Goh Feng Ji Mervin (an infant, suing by his father and next friend Goh Lip Ming) v Yeo Tze Phern_ (DC Suit 1686 of 1999, assessed in 2001); _Har Wong Wai_ (assessed in 2010); _Tan Shi Guo v China Construction (South Pacific) Development Co Pte Ltd and another_ (DC Suite 198 of 2003; assessed in 2003); _Wong Kwok Keong v Zee Lee Sieh (administratrix of the estate of Khong Yung Yew Aloysius, deceased) and another_ (Suit 913 of 1999; assessed in 2000). The other larger awards pertained to arthritis that was severe or pertained to injuries to multiple parts of the anatomy (_eg_, _Shyam Sundar Yadav v Reganathan s/o Sammandham_ (DC Suit 3149 of 2000); _Salinah Binte Yusop v The Legal Representative of Muhammad Farhal Dominic Rappa @ Dominic Wilfred Rappa (deceased)_ (Suit 551 of 2018)).

58     In my judgment, a slight uplift of $3,000.00 to $48,000.00 would fairly take into account P’s foot osteoarthritis and potential ankle osteoarthritis without overcompensating him.

59     In addition to the cases which parties cited, I would also think that a $48,000.00 award is fair when compared to _Azmi bin Mustapha v Ng Bok Leng_ (Suit 231 of 2008). The plaintiff there suffered a comminuted left calcaneal fracture, which was treated with open reduction and internal fixation, and multiple debridements, and partial calcanectomy (_ie_, hindfoot amputation). Together with a left foot plantar degloving, this injury left his foot severely dysfunctional, with an insensate sole that was unlikely to improve with time, a persistent neuropathic atrophic ulcer over a pressure point, and an extremely stiff ankle which was unable to dorsiflex more than 10°. The plaintiff was awarded $32,000.00 (with the foot injury attracting a further $12,000.00). These awards, adjusted for inflation, would have been about $38,000.00 and $14,000.00 respectively (_ie_, a total of $52,000.00). The residual disabilities there, in my judgment, are comparable but slightly more serious than what P has to suffer, even taking into account P’s foot osteoarthritis and potential ankle osteoarthritis.

##### (2)   Scarring

60     As a result of the above, P was left with a number of surgical scars. While these scars contracted over time, the relevant ones include at least the following:

> (a)     8–12cm scar over the medial foot;

> (b)     5cm scar on the dorsum of the foot; and

> (c)     4.5cm surgical scar on the upper lateral tibia (where the donor bone was harvested).

61     This is apart from a 2cm×2cm midfoot bony prominence, and permanent contraction and discolouration of the skin.

62     P submitted that $7,000.00 was awarded in _Quek Yen Fei Kenneth v Yeo Chye Huat_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 96</span> (“_Kenneth Quek_”) for an 18cm scar on the below-knee amputation stump, a 3cm scar on the right knee, and a 3cm scar on the back of the right shoulder.[^44] D made no direct submission on the award for the scarring. I find P’s submission of $10,000.00 slightly generous in comparison, considering that the scars here are concentrated on one lower leg and, on the whole, slightly smaller than the scars in _Kenneth Quek_. That said, I accept that P’s skin has also been discoloured. In the final analysis, I consider $8,000.00 to be a reasonable award for the scars.

63     In my judgment, the total award for pain and suffering for the foot—$56,000.00—plus $15,000.00 for CRPS (which I shall address below)—is a reasonable sum for P’s suffering.

### CRPS

64     I award P $15,000.00 for Type 1 CRPS.

#### Liability

65     In my view, P is suffering from Type 1 CRPS.

66     Generally, the experts agree that P is suffering from chronic pain. However, they disagree on how the pain should be characterised. Briefly, P claims to be suffering from CRPS (and seeks a separate award for it) whereas D claims that P is suffering from chronic pain syndrome (“CPS”), which should have been fully taken into account in the award for the left foot injury. I agree with P.

67     In 2019, Dr Kannan said that P had left foot post-injury scarring and sensory disturbance resulting in chronic pain, swelling and hypersensivity. In his view, P had, secondary to the injury and multiple surgeries, likely suffered permanent sensory damage over the left foot, and it was likely that the damaged superficial nerves were regenerating and manifesting as hypersensitivity syndrome, while the sympathetic neural overdrive caused the intense pain, swelling, warmth and redness. This, in his view, was clinically consistent with CRPS.[^45]

68     Dr George found that P was suffering from Type 1 CRPS, given that P displayed at least 3 symptoms and 2 signs of the Budapest criteria. She noted allodynia (_ie_, pain to touch) and severe tenderness over the left little toe and dorsum of the foot until the anterior lower shin, with an extremely tender 3cm round swelling over the outer aspect of the left foot and little toe, with movement of left foot joints and ankle limited by pain. A bone scan showed intense osteoblastic activity in the left midfoot with increased tracer flow, which she concluded might represent recent trauma or infection. Dr George considered reflex sympathetic dystrophy (“RSD”) less likely, but reasoned that the bone scan did not explain the symptoms and signs which extended beyond the area of lesion, and did not follow any distinct dermatomal distribution.[^46] However, Dr Chang considered this to be a slight contradiction because RSD was the old name for CRPS,[^47] and considered Dr George’s diagnosis to be wrong. In his view, he was equally capable of diagnosing such conditions.[^48]

69     Dr Inderjeet Singh, however, opined that P’s “residual pain is due to \[CRPS\] sometimes known as chronic pain syndrome”, as well as a 60% loss of motion at the hindfoot due to the TN joint fusion.[^49] Dr Chang disagreed that the pain was due to CRPS, and said that Dr Singh was “confused here; he is putting the two together”.

70     Dr Chang considered that P’s pain was due to CPS, which he considered to be ongoing pain lasting beyond the resolution of an injury, or pain that recurs as a result of a long-standing condition. According to Dr Chang, the criteria included pain lasting at least a month beyond what would be expected from an illness or injury, and recurring on-and-off for at least 3 months, and pain that accompanies a long-standing condition. In cross-examination, he said that CPS and CRPS are “not dissimilar” and “whether you label it A or B”, it was “semantics”; P had “pain disproportionate to injury and treatment, but to me it is genuine pain and we should treat it accordingly”.[^50] Dr Chang agreed with Dr Kannan’s description of P’s symptoms and signs and definitions of CPS and CRPS, and only disagreed as to whether P fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for CRPS.[^51]

71     In oral testimony, Dr Kannan explained that CRPS is a term which has been loosely used but, in medical training, is taught as a specific diagnostic entity with its own specific diagnostic criteria and is independent of CPS; he also said that pain specialists refrain from characterising CRPS as CPS because the treatment is different.[^52]

72     In my view, Dr Chang’s opinion is the least convincing. **First**, it suffers from an internal inconsistency which I cannot overlook. His insistence that P did not meet the diagnostic criteria for CRPS does not square with his concession that CPS and CRPS are just labels with semantic differences. In my view, the most charitable view of his opinion is that CRPS is a more severe form of CPS. **Second**, Dr Chang said that Dr George did not explain the 3 symptoms and 2 signs that make up CRPS, and dismissed the mention of increased osteoblastic activity as a lone sign.[^53] However, as noted in _Mykytowych, Pamela Jane v V I P Hotel_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 829</span> (CA) (“_Pamela Mykytowych_”) at \[82\], the symptoms and signs can be sensory (_eg_, allodynia to light touch), vasomotor (_ie_, temperature asymmetry), and motor-trophic (_eg_, decreased range of motion). I find that Dr Chang has ignored Dr George’s other observations (_eg_, findings and complaints of allodynia and restricted motion due to pain, and complaints of intense warmth) and reasoning (_eg_, symptoms and signs not explained by scans, and not following a dermatomal distribution) and his opinion in this regard is unsafe. **Third**, I found it surprising that Dr Chang claimed to be able to diagnose CRPS as well as a pain management expert, even though he was appointed as an orthopaedic expert and, respectfully, his curriculum vitae shows him to be an orthopaedic expert rather than a pain management expert.

73     Additionally, I find it significant that D chose not to cross-examine Dr George and Dr Singh, despite their opinion on CRPS, and I agree that D’s cross-examination of Dr Kannan was also not robust enough to truly challenge him with Dr Chang’s view.[^54]

74     Accordingly, I find that P is suffering from CRPS. I do not express a firm view on whether P suffers from CPS since this is not P’s case and, in any event, the pain and suffering arising from CPS would substantially overlap with that arising from CRPS.

#### Quantum

75     The _Guidelines_ posit at Ch 4 the following awards for CPS and CRPS:

>   
| 

**C.**

 | 

**CHRONIC PAIN SYNDROME (“CPS”)**

This condition often develops after the person experiences acute pain such as an injury. CPS is defined as pain that lasts for longer than the expected time for recovery of the injured tissue/muscle/ bone, normally taken as three months. Factors to be taken into consideration in deciding the quantum of the award include the following:

(i) Pain intensity;

(ii) Duration and persistence of pain;

(iii) Disabilities as a result of the chronic pain; and

(iv) Effectiveness of medication and cognitive behavioural therapy in controlling the pain.

$5,000–$10,000

 |
| 

**D.**

 | 

**REFLEX SYMPATHETIC DYSTROPHY**

(also called complex regional pain syndrome)

This is a chronic progressive disease that is characterised by severe pain, swelling and changes in the skin. Moving or touching the limb (or affected area) often results in intolerable pain and the said pain is heightened by emotional stress. As a result, the injured person does not move/use the affected limb and eventually, the skin, muscle and bone atrophy from disuse. In mild cases, the person recovers spontaneously within a few months with no lasting disabilities.

76     P submitted that a fair award would be $30,000.00.[^55]

77     I would consider P’s CRPS to be mild but approaching moderate, and think that $15,000.00 would be a fair award. Admittedly, this decision was arrived at not without difficulty.

78     In my view, P’s CRPS is not “severe”, as P submits, merely because P continues to suffer from CRPS, as CRPS is by definition chronic. Nor is it severe merely because P suffers severe chronic post-traumatic and post-surgical neuropathic bone pain.[^56] This observation was made in the context of P’s _overall_ pain and suffering. To regard this entirely as part of CRPS is to double-count P’s suffering. CRPS concerns the pain that goes beyond what can be expected from the injury and its treatment. Instead, P seems to have barely met the diagnostic criteria for CRPS, and there is no opinion from any of the doctors as to its severity.

79     In _Pamela Mykytowych_, the plaintiff was awarded $30,000.00 for Type I CRPS, which the court found to be of a moderate level. Against the backdrop of an undisplaced patella (_ie_, knee) fracture and ankle strain with relatively conservative treatment, the plaintiff’s CRPS initially left her with difficulty and needing some assistance in traversing uneven surfaces. This deteriorated subsequently such that the plaintiff was partly reliant on a wheelchair. In my judgment, P’s underlying injury (and the chronic pain that one can reasonably expect to arise from it), being a comminuted fracture entailing multiple surgeries, is more serious. In other words, I ought to be careful in concluding the extent to which P’s residual pain is disproportionate to the injury. P’s overall condition, in my judgment, also seems to be rather less debilitating on the whole. In my view, the award in this case should be considerably lower.

80      _Pamela Mykytowych_ referred to a number of foreign awards. In _Blight v Wagin_ Civ 7714 of 1993 (District Court, Western Australia) AUD35,000 was awarded for “mild to moderate” CRPS. In _Alexander Stewart Darg v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis_ \[2009\] EWHC 684 (QB), the English High Court awarded GBP32,500 for CRPS, and in _David Kerr v Stiell Facilities Ltd_ \[2009\] CSOH 67 (Scottish Court of Session), the plaintiff was awarded GBP40,000 for CRPS. However, I do not rely on them. It is unclear what the equivalent of these sums were in SGD, and what the purchasing power of those sums in the respective jurisdictions were. It is also unclear to me how _Pamela Mykytowych_ treated them, _ie_, whether an award for pain and suffering in Singapore ought to be more, equally or less generous. They are, unlike _Pamela Mykytowych_, not directly binding on me.

81     In _Margaret Mei_, P was diagnosed with RSD, and was awarded $100,000.00 (or about $130,000.00, if adjusted for inflation) as a global sum for pain and suffering. However, the injuries she suffered were “to say the least quite horrific” (_Khek Ching Ching v SBS Transit Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGDC 220</span> (“_Khek Ching Ching_”) at \[113\]). Her other injuries included 3 cut tendons, 1 cut artery, 1 cut deep peroneal nerve, a 7cm V-shape flap laceration over the dorsum of the right ankle, incision scars with keloid formation, and discolouration at the injury site. This sum also took into account the fact that the plaintiff had to undergo 10 procedures, was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, and had to deal with permanent physical disabilities.[^57]

82     This decision is also of limited assistance, principally because the extent to which the award in _Margaret Mei_ is notionally attributable to RSD is unclear. In any event, the disproportionate (and neuropathic) pain suffered by the plaintiff in _Margaret Mei_ far exceeds the disproportionate pain P suffered. The plaintiff in _Margaret Mei_ had to undergo some 6 procedures _relating to the nervous system_ in an attempt to alleviate the excruciating residual pain. In contrast, while P might be said to have undergone his 5th and 7th surgeries to deal with excessive residual pain, these related to organic sources of pain (_ie_, identifiable physical contributors to his pain). While the award for CRPS here should be considerably lower than whatever component of the award in _Margaret Mei_ is notionally attributable to RSD, the difference in facts make me think that any comparison between the two cases is limited as to its meaningfulness.

83     In _Khek Ching Ching_, the Court awarded the plaintiff $30,000.00 for CRPS Type I (or some $35,000.00, adjusted for inflation). There, the plaintiff experienced tenderness of the front of her chest, both wrists, both ankles and the right shoulder, with swelling in the left ankle.[^58] The court reasoned:

> 116    Based on the observations I have made, on the evidence before me I would award the sum of $30,000. I emphasize that this is not an exact science. I have come to this figure purely on a rough and ready basis taking into account what was awarded in \[_Margaret Mei_\]. In that case the award was put at $100,000. Bearing in mind that the medical condition of the Plaintiff is less severe than \[in _Margaret Mei_\] for the reasons I have already adverted to, I thought that to put the Plaintiff’s condition at one third the severity of \[_Margaret Mei_\] would not be unreasonable.

I do not accept D’s argument that there is too little information of the plaintiff’s CRPS to draw any meaningful comparison.[^59] The CRPS of the plaintiff in _Khek Ching Ching_ was significant, especially considering that her initial injury (and, therefore, the sequelae that can be expected of it) was relatively minor. Yet, the plaintiff there complained of “burning, electric shock-like on the left leg”, with “blotchiness … associated with feeling cold”; and was reported by another doctor as complaining of “chronic widespread pain, with intense pain in her left arm and leg”. Two experts agreed that the CRPS, which where the plaintiff’s leg was concerned was part of the autonomic response after the direct trauma, had “progressed to a more widespread and generalised chronic pain syndrome of secondary f\[i\]bromyalgia”, which resulted in “central sensiti\[s\]ation and hypersensitivity of the afferents (somatic) and autonomic nerves” which “is severe with significant disability and uncontrolled pain flares” (at \[65\]–\[73\]). In contrast, P has not received such a diagnosis. Instead, P experiences general significant pain in his foot, with warmth and redness during the sudden episodes of pain over the course of the day. Like _Pamela Mykytowych_, I think a considerably smaller award is fair.

84     It is not ideal to reason principally from only 2 cases (_ie_, _Pamela Mykytowych_ and _Khek Ching Ching_) in which the severity of the condition is quite different from that in the present case, but I am not aware of other published CRPS awards. In my best assessment, $15,000.00 is fair in comparison.

85     An award of $15,000.00 brings the pain and suffering award for P’s left leg injury to $71,000.00, which is in my judgment appropriate.

### Aggravation of L5S1 degeneration

86     I award P **$5,000.00** for aggravated spine degeneration at L5S1.

#### Liability

87     P claims that his degenerative spine at L5S1 was aggravated by both the accident and the abnormal gait with which it left him.[^60] In this regard, P relies on complaints of back pain that started in late 2013, and which worsened until late 2015. P continued to complain about back pain even in 2016, although this was not P’s chief complaint.

88     D disputes that the accident caused aggravated spine degeneration at L5S1.

89     In my view, the accident aggravated the degeneration of P’s spine, but not because the accident injured P’s spine; instead, I find that the accident had caused P to have an abnormal gait, which in turn aggravated the degeneration in P’s spine. I also do not think the aggravation was as serious as P claims.

90     Broadly, I accept what P submitted: that Dr Tow’s unchallenged evidence was that the accident aggravated degenerative changes in P’s spine.[^61] Dr Kannan also said that P’s back pain was aggravated due to P’s abnormal gait.[^62] While Dr Chang said that P’s back injury was not a result of the accident, that was not P’s case;[^63] and Dr Chang agreed in cross-examination that the abnormal gait had aggravated P’s back condition.[^64]

91     D makes 3 arguments:

> (a)     There is no aggravation of the back injury and, in any event, P has not discharged his burden of proving the extent of the aggravation.[^65] On one hand hand, P has a degenerated back; P suffered a L5S1 annular tear and prolapse serious enough to require physiotherapy, a spinal injection and a downgrade of P’s PES,[^66] the pain specialist, Dr George, stated that P started having low back pain 2–3 years prior to seeing her (_ie_, sometime in late 2007 to late 2008);[^67] and P was also found to have a pain score of 10/10 over 2 months when P first consulted Dr George on 9 December 2010 (_ie_, 8 days before the accident). On one hand, there is no evidence P injured his back from the accident, and no documented complaints of back problems/issues.[^68] P’s pain score in fact reduced to between 1/10–5/10 in the year following the accident.[^69] In this regard, D relies in _Lee Mui Yeng v Ng Tong Yoo_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 46</span> (“_Lee Mui Yeng_”). The plaintiff there was involved in a car accident, in which she claims she injured her knee. A few years later, she fell from the stairs and suffered further injuries, and claimed that the fall was attributed to the injured knee. However, the court disallowed the claim because there was no evidence that the claimant injured her knee in the car accident in the first place.[^70] D also relies on _Ong Lai Choo v Pang Raine_ (DC 356 of 2013). On appeal to the District Judge in chambers and to the High Court, the judges did not allow the claim for aggravation of pre-existing degenerated back, because the judge doubted that the claimant experienced back pain within 2 weeks of the accident.[^71]

> (b)     Dr Kannan’s opinion on the back issue is essentially suspect. _First_, he had not known that P had suffered a slipdisc for which he was downgraded as a result. _Second_, it was made not after an examination or radiological investigation of P’s back, but only after history-taking.[^72]_Third_, his reports did not contain any reference to P’s back issue, except for a mention in a 2016 report;[^73] and that he found aggravated degeneration not in 2016 but in 2019.[^74]

> (c)     Dr Tow’s opinion that the back pain was likely to have been aggravated by the accident does not satisfy the legal test for aggravation in _Mark Amaranganthan Selvaganathan v Cheung Man Wai_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 253</span>,[^75] which requires that the degeneration occur “at an accelerated rate after the accident” (at \[45\]).

92      **First**, I agree with D that P’s lumbar spine was degenerated at the time of the accident. In this regard, P submits that rule in _Browne v Dunn_ (1893) 6 R 67 prohibits D from submitting that the back pain started in 2007–2008, because P gave the best available evidence in terms of medical records,[^76] and clarified that “2–3 years prior” referred to 2012 rather than 2007–2008,[^77] whereas D chose not to cross-examine Dr George.[^78] However, I reject P’s submission because Dr George’s opinions were clear that the back pain started in 2007. When Dr George wrote in 2015 that the back pain started “2–3 years prior”, she could not have meant 2012. Her report, in its context, read: “\[P\] first consulted … on \[9 December 2010\] for low back pain when he was referred from Orthopaedic Dept … This, he said, started 2–3yrs prior, after an accident in the Navy when he fell and hit his back. An MRI of the lumbar spine on \[7 January 2010\] showed degenerate disc at L5/S1 …”[^79] If P’s back pain started in 2012, there was no reason to refer to a training injury, nor order an MRI on the back in 2010 (_ie_, 5 years before the opinion was written). Also, Dr George, in her 2011 memo, said that P had low back pain for the last 4 years.[^80] However, the point is that this argument does not dispose of the issue because P’s claim is for _aggravated_ degeneration.

93      **Second**, in my view, D’s focus on Dr Tow’s opinion sets up a straw man, because aggravated degeneration is established not by his opinion alone, but by comparing the evidence of back pain before and after the accident, and the doctors’ reasoning.

> (a)      **_To begin_**, Dr Chang examined P in August 2013, March 2016 and February 2019. I note that P reported to Dr Chang in 2013 and 2016 that he had back pain 1–2 times per year, which could last a day and settle with painkillers. In 2016, P added that, after the accident, his back pain averaged once a month and would take 3–4 days to settle.[^81] While P was being managed by the pain management centre until June 2012, P did not return for follow-ups until April 2014 (_ie_, nearly 2 years later), when he resumed his complaint of back pain and claimed that it had been worsening since the accident. Broadly speaking, I accepted P’s evidence that his back pain had worsened and, in my judgment, the increase in its frequency and severity was beyond the natural progression of degeneration. Over the course of the AD, I generally found P to be a measured, truthful witness, and this was quite consistent with the history taken by other doctors.

> (b)      **_Next_**, the fact that Dr Kannan’s opinion was not founded on radiological investigations or thorough understanding of P’s history is not fatal for at least 3 reasons. _One_, the absence of before-and-after X-Ray/MRI/CT films are of secondary importance because, ultimately, it is the pain from the degeneration—which has been well-documented—that justifies the award. _Two_: Dr Kannan, in re-examination, stated that, knowing of P’s slipdisc and downgrade, would have said instead that P’s abnormal gait would have aggravated his slipdisc.[^82]_Three_, D has not explained why Dr Chang would readily agree that P’s back injury had been aggravated. In fact, Dr Kannan and Dr Chang gave similar reasons as to why P would suffer a degenerated back. Dr Kannan said that the back condition was aggravated by P bearing weight with an awkward gait,[^83] and this was something Dr Chang agreed with in cross-examination.[^84] This naturally takes time to be felt, and explains the delay in seeking medical attention. Given how P’s back pain would set in, I find the cases which D cited of little relevance.

> (c)      **_Finally_**, the fact that P had a reduced pain score in the year following the accident is not entirely surprising. First, P’s injury has made him unable to engage in rigorous physical activity and that P was on painkillers. Second, the doctors agree that the accident did not directly injure P’s back. The reduced pain score after the accident, along with the fact that P consulted Dr George only 1 week before the accident despite having had pains for about 2–3 years, suggests that the pain score of 10/10 in the month preceding the accident was a passing phase.

#### Quantum

94     The _Guidelines_ posit at Ch 3 that minor back injuries (described as “strains, sprains, disc prolapses, soft tissue injuries with full recovery … within about five years”) attract awards of $2,000.00–$10,000.00, with an award in the higher range being appropriate if there is an “increased vulnerability to future trauma due to the weakened lumbar spine”. The lesser category—where full recovery is achieved “within about two years”—attracts a $2,000.00 award.

95     P submitted that a fair award would be $8,000.00.[^85]

96     In my judgment, $5,000.00 is sufficient compensation. While I agree that P’s spine degeneration was aggravated secondary to the accident, the _extent_ to which P’s back pain had been aggravated is less clear. P’s complaints about back pain are less pressing than his complaints about his foot. That said, I am satisfied that the increased back pain will affect P for a long time to come, since it arises from P’s awkward gait (which has not left P).

97     P highlighted a number of precedents for my consideration.

> (a)      _Rathanamalah d/o Shunmugam v Chia Kok Hoong_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 159</span> (HC) turned out to be entirely unhelpful.[^86] Although P submits that $3,300 was assessed in damages, this was a putative award (_ie_, _dicta_) for medical expenses in a failed medical negligence claim, and not an actual award for pain and suffering. I do not find this decision helpful.

> (b)     In _Pang Tim Fook Paul v Ang Swee Koon and another_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGDC 258</span>, P was awarded $6,500 for a lower back injury. In making the award, the Court considered that the plaintiff had difficulty lifting heavy loads.[^87] However, this was a case of a direct back injury to an otherwise pristine back. In comparison, P was already suffering back pain, and the sequelae of the accident made it worse. In my judgment, it was not made so much worse that it should attract an award as if it was a fresh injury. In _Tan Shi Lin_, $10,000.00 was awarded for low back pain which arose as a result of uneven gait.[^88] However, the uneven gait there arose as a result of a severe foot injury which entailed amputation of 2 toes, and for which $90,000.00 was assessed in damages. In comparison, the circumstances leading to P’s uneven gait were less severe, and there is little that leads me to think that the unevenness of P’s gait and the attendant back pain will be comparable to that in _Tan Shi Lin_. In my judgment, the compensation due in this case should be considerably lower in comparison. $5,000, in my view, is a fair sum.

### Wrist/TFCC injury

98     I award P $2,000.00 for a left wrist injury.

#### Liability

99     On 18 February 2011, P reported a left wrist injury, which was treated conservatively with a cast immobilisation for 6 weeks, and with an excuse of heavy exercise involving his left arm.

100    D disputes this claim entirely.

101     **First**, D argues that, at the consultation in the emergency department, there was no complaint of wrist pain even though this would have been featured in the medical report if it was present.[^89] There was also no mention of wrist injuries on reports based on P’s admission from 5–8 Jan 2021, even though this ought to have been picked up during P’s 3-day admission.[^90] D also argues that P did not answer directly when cross-examined on whether P informed the doctors of wrist pain.[^91]

102    However, P testified that he did not complain of his left wrist pain because his main concern was his most serious injury—his left foot.[^92] P’s lack of contemporaneous complaints is explained by the fact he had a major left foot injury and 2 major surgeries on 6 Jan and 11 Feb 2011.[^93] I do not accept D’s submission that the wrist injury ought to have been in the emergency department medical report. P had suffered a comminuted navicular bone fracture, which was by far the most serious injury. It is entirely conceivable—even probable—that P might only have complained about pain in his foot, and P cannot be faulted for that. Further, even if there were complaints about a wrist injury, it would have been of secondary interest to the emergency department (which is presumably interested only in life-threatening or otherwise serious injuries). It could have been content to refer P to the orthopaedic department for closer investigation (as it stated in its report). The same logic prevails for P’s inpatient discharge summary, which was still a relatively short time after the accident and which related to surgery on P’s foot. Wrist pain would not have been a key concern to the doctors performing the foot surgery.

103    Also, contrary to D’s submission, I do not think P was evasive in cross-examination, even if he did not answer the question directly. The relevant part of cross-examination reads:

> Q:    Moving on to wrist injury.

>> See PBD3. 18 Feb 2011 SGH memo. This came about slightly <2m post-\[accident\]. See PBD5 – this is first record of injuries in \[accident\]. This report does not mention left wrist issue. Do you recall telling them you had left wrist pain?

> A:    There was pain all over me. My main concern was foot. Suddenly I could not stand.

> Q:    See PBD19. Outpatient discharge advice 22 May 2012. You recall foot injection?

> A:    I think this is because of foot infection.

> Q:    See BA19. No report of issue with left wrist?

> A:    Left wrist lasted until 1st operation, which was Jan–Feb 2011. Then they casted me. After that, I took some painkillers, and it went off a while later. As you can see, I did not mention very much in my affidavit. It lasted a short while and then it went off. On day of accident, there was pain everywhere, bruises everywhere. Leg had excruciating pain.

> Q:    So I presume it went away by Feb?

> A:    Before the next review, which is before May.

> Q:    Your discharge in Jan, and you returned to remove stitches in Feb. By then, pain gone?

> A:    I remember this clearly. It was still there when I removed stitches. But it went away before I came back in May. 2–3 months.

> Q:     _Cf_ BA256, para 16. This is your 3rd affidavit that you signed in Mar 2014.

> A:    Yes, I still experience left wrist pain, but I don’t complain much about it.

At PBD5 is the report from the emergency department. P might be taken to have tacitly admitted that he did not complain of left wrist pain, but his reply was in my judgment a perfectly reasonable explanation.

104    I also find it probable that the wrist complaint arose from the accident because it pertained to the same side as the foot injury (_ie_, left side), and because P’s limited mobility subsequent to the accident would have made it unlikely for another traumatic event to have given rise to this pain (in my view, this hypothesis was also not seriously put to P).

105     **Next**, D argues that the medical report that supposedly supports this finding does not state the type of injury suffered, and expresses a suspicion without further confirmation, and does not say that P was in fact prescribed a cast for 6 weeks.[^94]

106    However, this ignores P’s photographic evidence of having been in both a lower leg and wrist cast on 1 April 2011 (_ie_, 8 weeks after the memo was prepared) (P testified that he had recovered by May 2011).[^95] The fact that the medical report expresses a suspicion is not fatal, because doctors do not necessarily investigate every complaint in the hope that it might be resolved with conservative treatment. The ultimate point is that P reported pain and suffering, which I find to be true and attributable to the accident.

#### Quantum

107    The _Guidelines_ posit at Ch 5 that, for wrist injuries:

>   
| 

**F.**

**…**

 | 

**WRIST**

 | 

 |
| 

**(b)**

 | 

**Moderately severe fractures of the distal radius or ulna**

Substantial recovery is achieved but there is significant permanent disability and considerable pain on a long-term basis that cannot be resolved despite treatment. There is considerable loss of function but the person is still able to cope with the activities of daily life although he is unlikely to return to his pre-trauma employment especially if it is a labour-intensive job requiring extensive use of his hands.

 | 

$15,000–$25,000

 |
| 

**(c)**

 | 

**Moderate fractures of the distal radius and/or ulna**

Cases in this category are less severe than (b) above in that the person is able to regain substantial function of his wrist. However, his chances of being employed in his pre-trauma job (especially if it is a labour-intensive job requiring use of the hands) are reduced and it is unlikely that his condition will improve in the future.

 | 

$6,000–$15,000

 |
| 

**(d)**

 | 

**Minor undisplaced or minimally displaced fractures**

There is some soft tissue damage but full recovery is achieved (with the aid of physiotherapy) within a few months with no lasting disabilities.

 | 

$2,000–$3,000

(General maximum for complete recovery (though longer period required) at $6,000.)

 |

  
  

108    P submitted that a fair award would be $6,000.00.[^96] P submits that his injury falls within the “moderate” category, as he had to wear a cast for 6 weeks and he still experienced occasional left wrist pain more than 4 years after the accident.[^97] P relied on _Seow Hwa Chuan v Ong Wah Chuan_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 146</span>, where $5,000.00 was awarded for a right wrist injury treated conservatively. However, the injury there was diagnosed as a right wrist fracture (at \[5(a)\]). Here, the injury is unspecified. While this does not strictly speaking preclude an award, my doubt as to the nature of the award must be resolved in D’s favour. I hesitate to make an award _as if_ it were a fracture. The occasional wrist pain also does not take an otherwise minor injury to the moderate category. In the final analysis, I find that $2,000.00 is a fair award for the wrist pain given the state of the evidence.

## Abrasions over left elbow

109    I award P $1,000.00 for his left elbow abrasions.

110    When P first presented to the emergency department, he was found to have small abrasions over his left elbow.

111    P submits that $2,000.00 be awarded for this injury.

112    However, I agree with D’s submission that an award of $1,000.00 is fair.

113     **First**, I am persuaded by D’s argument that P did not present further evidence on the size of the abrasions, or the actual number of abrasions, or photographs of the elbow.[^98] As a result, it does not help P to argue that D chose not to cross-examine P on this point.[^99] Ultimately, P must prove the extent of his loss. Without more, I can only find there were 2 (being the lowest plural number) small abrasions.

114     **Second**, since the _Guidelines_ posit that an award of $500–$3,000 be made for multiple abrasions, I find that $1,000.00 to be a fair award.

115     **Third**, P cites _Ang Tong Yew v Tey Keng Hai_ (MC 910/2010) (“_Ang Tong Yew_”). There, $2,000.00 was awarded for “right flank and lumbar superficial abrasions and bilateral elbow abrasions”. Even if the award in _Ang Tong Yew_ is inflation-adjusted, an award of $1,000.00 seems fair in comparison considering that the abrasions there involved 4 areas on the body whereas the abrasions here were in a single region.

### Dysthymia

116    I award P $9,000.00 for dysthymia.

117    P was first diagnosed with dysthymia in 2014 by Dr Lim. Dr Lim concluded that this was a result of the accident and occasioned by the long-standing pain, disability and disruption to P’s daily life and career.[^100] Dr Lim then referred the Plaintiff to Mr Kevin Beck, a principal psychologist from SGH. Both Dr Lim and Mr Beck’s reports were unchallenged.

118    Between 2014 and 2019, P had very low mood, with loss of appetite, insomnia, weight loss, and fleeting suicidal thoughts. P was treated with psychotherapy and psychiatric medication like antidepressants and strong analgesics. Even 5 years post-accident, P reported difficulty sleeping, irritability, and mood swings. Dr Lim said P possibly required ongoing psychiatric treatment for the next 5–10 years, and Mr Beck said that P would benefit from future therapy and counselling for at least 3 years.

119    The _Guidelines_ posit at Ch 4:

>   
| 

**A.**

 | 

**GENERAL PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER**

This section covers psychiatric conditions not provided for specifically in the sections below. There is a myriad of psychiatric conditions that could result from experiencing a traumatic event, _eg_. depression, avoidant phobias, anxiety attacks, etc. They range in severity too, with the most severe psychiatric conditions debilitating a person to the extent he is unable to cope with the activities of daily life.

The factors to be taken into account in valuing claims of this nature are as follows:

(i) The person’s ability to cope with life and work in general as compared to his pre-trauma state

(ii) The effect on the person’s relationships with the family, friends and those with whom he or she comes into contact with

(iii) Whether the person is suicidal as a result of his psychiatric condition

(iv) Whether medical help has been sought

(v) The extent to which treatment would be successful

(vi) The extent to which the medication affects the person’s work and social life

(vii) Whether the persons adheres faithfully to counselling sessions and takes his or her medication

(viii) The risk of relapse in the future

(ix) The chances of recovery in the future

 | 

 |
| 

**(a)**

 | 

**Severe**

The persons suffers from marked problems with respect to factors (i) to (vi). Despite treatment, the prognosis remains very poor as the person is unlikely to be able to return to employment permanently or even take charge of his daily affairs.

 | 

$25,000–$55,000

 |
| 

**(b)**

 | 

**Moderately severe**

There are significant problems associated with factors (i) to (vi) but the prognosis would be much more optimistic than in (a). However, the person may still have long-term problems coping with the stressors of work life and the demands of social life this preventing a return to pre-trauma employment. He is however, able to perform the activities of his daily life independently.

 | 

$8,000–$25,000

 |
| 

**(c)**

 | 

**Moderate**

In cases of moderate severity, the person experiences problems associated with factors(i) to (vi) above. However, he shows marked improvement with treatment. Prognosis is good for the category.

 | 

$3,000–$8,000

 |
| 

**(d)**

 | 

**Minor**

In this category, full recovery is achieved within a short period of time and the risk of relapse in the future is small. The person is able to return to previous employment with little or no residual disabilities. The level of the award takes into consideration the relatively short length of period of disability and the extent to which daily activities and sleep were affected.

 | 

$1,000–$3,000

 |

  
  

120    P submitted that his condition fell between the moderately severe to severe range, and that a fair award would be $25,000.00,\\[^101] while D submitted that P fell into the “minor” or “moderate” categories, and a fair award would be $3,000.00.[^102]

121    I agree with P that his condition is not “minor” as he has been suffering from dysthymia for 5 years despite regular follow-up and treatment (in this regard, I find that P hardly defaulted on treatment, and if he did so it was with good reason), and will continue to grapple with it for the next 3–10 years. In this sense, P’s condition is chronic.[^103]

122    P’s wife gave unchallenged evidence that P’s character changed and his mood became particularly bad, and this affected his relationship with his wife and children.[^104] P also entertained fleeting suicidal thoughts in 2014–2015. In my view, this struggle is not negated by the fact (which D highlights) that P’s became his motivation for not wanting to end his life.[^105] Broadly, I agree with D that there is little evidence as to the extent which dysthymia (or the medication prescribed for it) affected P’s work or social life.[^106] I do _not_ make anything of D’s submission that P managed to visit and bring food to his father-in-law with his brother,[^107] since this was a one-off incident that happened when P had not been diagnosed with dysthymia yet.[^108] I also do _not_ make anything of D’s submission that P was tasked to organise a Deepavali function at work after the accident,[^109] since this did not come to fruition for budgetary reasons. However, I find it relevant that P was promoted in 2017, and his evidence was that he was instrumental in a Navy project, which suggests that P’s psychiatric condition did not hinder P significantly.[^110] P points out that he was able to remain in the Navy due to its benevolence,[^111] but the spectre of being discharged from the Navy was more a result of P’s foot injury (which led to him being placed on long medical leave) than P’s psychiatric injury.

123    That said, I find that P’s condition has improved over the years. In this regard, D highlights that P had 17 psychotherapy sessions from 2015 to 2019, starting with 5 in 2015 and tapering down to 2 in 2019.[^112] I also broadly accept D’s submission insofar that Dr Lim suggested that substantial recovery could be achieved.[^113] I also note that dysthymia is, by definition, a milder form of depression.

124    In _Rahman_, the plaintiff was awarded $20,000.00 for depression, where, as P highlights, he was concerned about the future of his family and financial constraints, and even without evidence that he was undergoing treatment for depression in Bangladesh.[^114] However, the plaintiff there suffered from a major depressive episode with moderate severity. Contrary to the impression given in P’s submission that the Court there considered that the plaintiff might be able to avoid a relapse, the Court in fact noted that major depressive disorder is highly recurrent, with 50% or more having additional episodes in their lifetime and relapse being made more likely with poor social circumstances (which the plaintiff was in). In my view, the award here should be significantly lower, considering that the condition is a milder one. In _Ng Lay Peng v Gain City Engineering & Consultancy Pte Ltd (Ng Peng Boon, third party) (AXA Insurance Singapore Pte Ltd, intervener)_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 184</span>, Andrew Ang SJ awarded $12,000.00 for major depressive disorder even though the injuries suffered by the plaintiff was not very serious, and the plaintiff was diagnosed with depression 4½ years after the accident.[^115] In my view, the injuries suffered by a plaintiff are of secondary relevance to a psychiatric disorder, which has its own diagnostic criteria. Again, the point is that P’s condition is milder, and the award should be rather lower in comparison. In my judgment, $9,000.00 is a fair award in comparison to these precedents.

125    In sum, my global award for pain and suffering is $88,000.00. I am satisfied that this sum is neither excessive nor inadequate as recompense for P’s pain and suffering.

## Medical/transport-related losses

### Pre-AD medical expenses

126    I award pre-AD medical expenses of $8,202.67, as I (and P) accept D’s submission.[^116]

### Pre-AD transport expenses

127    I award pre-AD transport expenses of $3,480.00, as I accept the parties’ common submission.[^117]

### Future medical expenses

128    For the purpose of FME, both parties accept that P, being a Navy serviceman, has the benefit of the SAF medical co-payment scheme, under which he need only pay for 15% of his medical expenses while he is with the Navy. Both parties also proceed on the assumption that P will retire from the Navy at 60 years old.

#### Revision of fusion surgery

129    First, P claims $16,000.00 for the revision of fusion surgery for the foot.

130    I allow this head of claim in full.

131    P highlights that Dr Kannan (_ie_, P’s expert) said that P will require the “removal of implants, revision foot osteotomy and corrective arthrodesis to restore the anatomy of the foot and ensure appropriate fusion of the joints”[^118] and that Dr Chang (_ie_, D’s expert) agreed with Dr Kannan’s assessment.[^119] I also accept P’s submissions to the extent that Dr Kannan’s opinion was given with the benefit of Dr Chang’s report, and that Dr Kannan displayed a sound understanding of P’s condition and his opinion that P required future surgery was amply grounded in observable evidence and reason.[^120]

132    D disputes this claim. D makes the twin argument that Dr Kannan’s opinion is contradicted by the opinion of A/Prof Singh, who was P’s treating doctor and stated clearly that there was no anticipated future surgery for P,[^121] and that A/Prof Singh’s evidence should receive more weight because he:

> (a)     is P’s treating doctor, had operated on P, and has the most intimate knowledge amongst all the doctors in the case;[^122]

> (b)     is a senior practitioner and a leading practitioner in the foot and ankle sub-speciality;[^123] and

> (c)     gave his opinion with the benefit of both Dr Chang’s and Dr Kannan’s reports.[^124]

133    However, I do not accept D’s submissions for a few reasons.

134     **First**, as P argues, Dr Chang (D’s expert) had also recommended revision surgery, as did Dr Kannan.[^125]

135     **Second**, I pay limited heed to A/Prof Singh’s statement that “there is no anticipated future surgery for \[P\]”, even if it was given in 2019.

> (a)      **_First_**, A/Prof Singh’s statement, when read in context, is in my judgment not an absolute statement.

>> (i)       Even though his opinion was sought with Dr Kannan’s and Dr Chang’s opinion in mind, the request to know any required/anticipated/expected future surgery followed P’s lawyer highlighting the differences between Dr Kannan’s and Dr Chang’s views as to whether P was suffering from CRPS/CPS, but _not_ future medical treatment.

>> (ii)       Dr Kannan explained that the apparent difference in opinion could have resulted from different doctors assessing the patient (as a result of rotations in restructured hospitals), even if A/Prof Singh was named as the treating physician.[^126] He also warned that A/Prof Singh should be asked if there were qualifications to his statement.[^127] I am therefore hesitant to treat A/Prof Singh’s view at face value.

>> (iii)       A/Prof Singh’s recommendation in 2019 was at least 3 years’ worth of physiotherapy and injections. The fact that he had assessed P to suffer from lifelong pain leads me to think that, in this report, he simply did not focus on the treatment required in the distant future.

>> (iv)       P testified that A/Prof Singh had actually said that P might need surgery, depending on the recovery.[^128]

> (b)      **_Second_**, as P highlights, A/Prof Singh had, in 2 reports issued in January and June 2016, advocated the same fusion surgery.[^129] In January 2016, he said that P was expected to develop osteoarthritis at the calcaneocuboid, subtalar and midtarsal joints over the next 20 years, and might need surgical fusion at one or more of these joints, should the symptoms be severe.[^130] In June 2016, he said that P might need surgical fusions of the hindfoot/midfoot joints in future, depending on the symptoms of pain.[^131] Given that the horizon of Dr Singh’s assessment extends to at least 2035, and that P has continued to complain of significant pain, I do not consider that Dr Singh could have definitively assessed P in early 2019 (_ie_, some 16–17 years from the end of the horizon) as no longer requiring further fusion surgeries.

136    In terms of quantification, I accept P’s submission. $16,000.00 was the midpoint of the range given by Dr Kannan,[^132] and is also exactly what Dr Chang said the cost would be. I also accept P’s submission that the full sum is payable since the revision surgery is expected to take place after P’s retirement from the Navy, such that P will not be covered under the SAF medical co-payment scheme.

#### Ankle surgery

137    Next, P claims $9,000.00, being the estimated cost of an expected ankle joint debridement surgery. Again, D disputes this claim.

138    I disallow this claim.

139    Dr Singh, as the treating doctor, did not appear to have recommended this surgery at all. The most that can be said is that he assessed in June 2016 that P would develop hindfoot and possibly midfoot osteoarthritis, and might need surgical fusions of these joints in future, depending on the symptoms of pain.[^133] He, however, did not state that P required ankle joint debridement. His assessment, insofar as it meant that P would have hindfoot osteoarthritis followed by midfoot osteoarthritis, did not turn out to be entirely accurate, since subsequent radiological investigations showed midfoot secondary arthritis but not hindfoot arthritis. In other words, the ankle joint was, contrary to prediction, not yet arthritic. In this light, P’s arguments about interpreting Dr Singh’s statement that there is no anticipated future surgery do not assist him. Similarly, as I explained above, Dr Chang also did not advocate the ankle surgery.

140    P highlights Dr Kannan’s observation that P’s “subjective symptoms and physical findings point to ankle involvement, which would mean that the increased loading on the ankle will lead to degenerative changes (osteoarthritis) in the ankle”.[^134] Thus, Dr Kannan said that there was a >50% chance that P would require arthroscopic left ankle debridement surgery.[^135]

141    However, Dr Kannan’s premises do not seem to support his conclusion, in the sense that arthroscopic left ankle debridement was said to be a surgery to restore function in younger active patients. However, by the time P requires such a surgery, he will no longer be young and active.

142    Also, while Dr Kannan has explained why P might have ankle arthritis, it is, as I alluded to above at \[35\], another thing to say that the arthritis will be so serious that P will need surgery. Dr Kannan himself said that “typically surgery is last resort”.[^136] Dr Chang also testified that he would perform ankle surgery “only if \[the\] ankle is arthritic”[^137] (I take this to mean “arthritic to the point of requiring surgery”). But, Dr Chang also said that the increased stress to the ankle joint was unlikely to result in ankle osteoarthritis to need surgery like arthroscopic debridement,[^138] because radiologically the ankle joint was pristine.[^139] This contrasts with Dr Kannan’s observation that P had, by October 2016, secondary osteoarthritis of adjacent midfoot joints apart from the fused joints,[^140] and that this had progressed by January 2019.[^141] The fact that P’s ankle (_ie_, hindfoot) joint still remained pristine almost 2.5 years later suggests that ankle osteoarthritis will set in considerably more slowly. Even considering the long horizon, I am not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that P’s ankle will be arthritic to the point of requiring debridement surgery. Dr Kannan pointed out that Dr Chang’s conclusion contradicted his findings and observations,[^142] and highlighted that P’s ankle range of motion was already severely limited. However, Dr Chang’s views are persuasive in showing that P will become arthritic; it is less so when trying to show that P will require surgery for the osteoarthritis.

143    P, finally, appears to suggest that Dr Kannan was not challenged with Dr Chang’s opinion. However, I am unmoved by this as Dr Kannan, in his final report, had the benefit of Dr Chang’s opinion and also the benefit of examining P, ordering radiological investigations and expressing his views.

#### Long-term orthopaedic/pain management follow-up and medication

144    P then claims the following in lifelong orthopaedic/pain management expenses, based on a 15-year split multiplier on the premises that P has a remaining life expectancy of 81 years – 51 years = 30 years, of which the first 10 will be spent in the Navy, where P will only need to co-pay 15% of his medical expenses. The claimed items are as follows:

146    As regards these heads of claim, I make 2 preliminary points.

> (a)     First, I note that the tranches of the AD were spread over about 1.5 years. For the purpose of assessment, I will treat losses occurring up to 2019 as pre-AD losses, and losses thereafter as future losses. This is on the basis that P completed his evidence in 2019, and the final tranches of documentary evidence were admitted in late 2019. Since D did not dispute P’s life expectancy, I will treat P as having 31 years of natural life remaining, for the purpose of assessing his future losses.

> (b)     Second, I do not agree with P’s calculation insofar as P uses an (undiscounted) 10-year multiplier for the next 10 years in which he will remain a navy regular and co-pay his medical bills. Instead, I will apply the discounting method as explained in _Quek Yen Fei Kenneth v Yeo Chye Huat_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 229</span> (CA) (“_Kenneth Quek_ (CA)”), save that the discount rate will be 4.25% per annum, based on the recent decision in _Christian Joachim Pollmann v Ye Xianrong_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 77</span> (“_Pollmann_”) at \[75\] _per_ Vinodh Coomaraswamy J.

147    My views on the individual items are as follows.

##### (1)   Physiotherapy

148    I find that P is entitled to the cost of **physiotherapy**, but with less generous premises than P submits.

149    Broadly, in terms of **_duration_**, Dr Singh and Dr Kannan both prescribed physiotherapy. I am prepared to award P the costs of lifelong physiotherapy on the basis of Dr Kannan’s recommendation. While Dr Chang said that physiotherapy need not be provided for on the basis that P had told him that physiotherapy was not helping,[^147] D in substance accepts that some physiotherapy should be provided for, save that lifelong physiotherapy is unrealistic considering that P had stopped physiotherapy.[^148] More generally, D submits that Dr Singh’s opinion should be preferred, because Dr Kannan is lacking in intimate knowledge and familiarity of the case since he did not treat or operate on P, but saw him only 3 times starting 6 years after the accident, and his views are accordingly theoretical/academic (and also too different from the other doctors to be credible).[^149] However, Dr Singh said that P would require “at least” 3 years’ worth of physiotherapy. This is not inconsistent with the proposition that P will require physiotherapy for a longer time than that.

150    That said, I find that P has quite overstated his case in terms of the **_frequency_** of physiotherapy.

151    After 2016, there is scant evidence of P having undergone physiotherapy. The last receipt in the record that pertains to physiotherapy was in November 2015.[^150] Dr Chang noted in March 2016 that P was attending physiotherapy once every 2 months for evaluation of his exercises.[^151] By June 2016, Dr Singh had stated that “at the moment, \[P was\] being managed with medications for his pain”.[^152] While a paragraph in Dr Kannan’s opinion prepared in October 2016 began with “even as \[P\] continues his physiotherapy”, nowhere in his history-taking was it noted that P was undergoing physiotherapy. By February 2019, P had supposedly told Dr Chang that he had stopped physiotherapy as it was not helping his symptoms. Dr Kannan also testified that P had told him that P had “missed a few appointments” and had stopped physiotherapy for a variety of reasons including time and cost, even though it was helping him.[^153] I find that physiotherapy gave P limited relief, and accordingly I ought not to make an award for future medical expenses simply because the doctors prescribed it. Instead, I will allow the claim only to the extent I am satisfied that the expenses will be consumed.

152    Contrary to P’s submission, the record does not show P having given any explanation why he stopped physiotherapy, such as being concerned about losing his job and temporarily stopping physiotherapy.[^154] This was simply P’s instruction to counsel for the purpose of cross-examining Dr Chang.[^155] In any event, I am not entirely satisfied with this explanation, because of the glaring lack of evidence of having attended physiotherapy from 2016 to 2019 (such as appointment cards, receipts, or contemporaneous history-taking in medical reports). It also does not entirely explain why P chose to default on _all_ his physiotherapy appointments but still honour a substantial number of medical follow-ups. P’s concern that he would lose his job for attending physiotherapy too frequently does not square with his claim that he was already on medical leave from August 2017 to June 2018: if P was already on medical leave, P could have attended physiotherapy at no further risk to his employment.

153    Considering, further, that P was professedly attending physiotherapy only once every 2 months in 2016, there is little basis to award him costs for physiotherapy on a considerably more frequent basis.

154    I also expect the frequency to diminish in the long-term as P’s condition settles, even considering that this is “maintenance physiotherapy” (in Dr Kannan’s words). I do not think that P will still be attending physiotherapy with the same frequency in 20–30 years’ time and, at any rate, not because of the accident. For example, P might require physiotherapy as a natural consequence of aging, but D cannot be responsible for this.

155    As for the **_cost_** of physiotherapy, D submits that the cost of physiotherapy be $20.00, based on 4 receipts for $19.80 each.[^156] In reply, P submits that the sum of $100.00 is reasonable because this was Dr Kannan’s unchallenged evidence of the cost of physiotherapy at a B1 rate, and that there had been 50% inflation in some other consultation costs between 2011 and 2019.[^157]

156    I cannot accept that inflation will bring the cost of therapy from $19.80 to $100.00 in a matter of 8 years; an increase of over 400% is simply unrealistic. However, I note that physiotherapy in 2015 cost $87.21, although this comprised 2 line items: physiotherapy assessment/education at $41.73 and therapeutic exercises at $45.48 (this cost $37.88 in 2013). The line item in the receipts relied on by D’s counsel, however, was for “physiotherapy review”, which in 2013 had risen to $22.68.[^158] It appears that physiotherapy is not a homogenous expense, but comprises a cycle of assessments/education and exercises, with a series of reviews thereafter. I proceed on the basis that P is likely to require (and attend) physiotherapy starting at once every 2 months in the immediate future, comprising 2 assessments/educations with exercises, and 4 reviews. Considering the cost of assessments/educations and exercises in 2015, I am satisfied that one such session would cost $100.00. On the other hand, there is no direct evidence for the cost of a physiotherapy review today, but I am prepared to proceed on the basis that it has since risen to at least $25.00. This works out to be $100.00 × 2 + $25.00 × 4 = $300.00/year. By the end of P’s expected natural life, I consider P to require 1 assessment/education and exercise with 2 reviews per year, _ie_, $100.00 × 1 + $25.00 × 2 = $150.00/year.

157    Based on the premises above, I find that the total future physiotherapy expense is **$2,212.32**. The detailed summation is found at Annex A.

##### (2)   Medical consultations

158    P is entitled to some costs of **follow-up medical consultation**. Both Dr Kannan and Dr Chang considered that P would need follow-up consultations. Dr Singh was silent on this issue but I do not consider him as saying that it is unnecessary; instead, consultations are in my judgment part and parcel of treatment. However, I am unpersuaded by Dr Kannan’s view of frequent lifelong medical consultations. He said that the onset of post-traumatic osteoarthritis is certain and only a lifelong period of follow-up can indicate when a medical intervention is necessary.[^159] However, this ignores the fact that a reasonable patient will generally seek medical attention when he is symptomatic, and not when he is asymptomatic. There is nothing to suggest that P must pre-emptively attend consultations with the same regularity for the rest of his life.

159    As with physiotherapy, I consider that P will not need medical consultations at an unchanging frequency for the rest of his natural life. In this regard, I am more inclined to Dr Chang’s view that P should have follow-up thrice yearly in the first 5 years and twice yearly in the next 10 years, but I will provide for _ad hoc_ (yearly) reviews thereafter. I also accept P’s unchallenged submission that a consultation costs $150.00.

160    This works out to be **$2,253.80**. The detailed summation is found at Annex B.

![]([2021] SGDC 0103_Image/[2021] SGDC 0103_image2.png)

##### (3)   Cartilage supplements/painkillers and medication

161    P is entitled to the costs of **cartilage supplements/painkillers and medication**. All 4 doctors prescribed some form of medication or injections. The need for this was “lifelong” (Dr Kannan), indefinite (Dr George) and long-term (Dr Chang). Dr Singh added that P would need quarterly injections for at least 3 years. I therefore award P costs for lifelong painkillers.

162    However, I am not persuaded by Dr Kannan’s view that P’s medication would cost $325.00/month (or $3,900.00/year). This is simply not borne out by the medical receipts. I find that the after-GST and before co-payment cost of medications, injections and orthotics cost only some $3,300 between 2011 and 2018.[^160] In the 2 most recent years, where P was receiving injections regularly, P’s medical bills averaged $508 per year (this was $368 per year on average in the preceding years). Even on P’s best case, based on his medical expenses less surgery costs, he has only spent some $20,000 between 2011 and 2018 (_ie_, some $2,000 per year on average) on consultations, medications, and other modes of treatment, but this includes medical expenses for _both_ his orthopaedic and psychiatric/psychological issues.

163    In the premises, I find it fairer to award P the costs of future medication at a round sum of $500 per year in the immediate year (reflecting P’s most recent expenses on medication), which will diminish to a round sum of $370 per year by the end of P’s natural life (reflecting P’s medication expenses in earlier years).

164    This works out to **$4,376.13**. The detailed summation is found at Annex C.

![]([2021] SGDC 0103_Image/[2021] SGDC 0103_image3.png)

##### (4)   Desensitisation therapy

165    P is not entitled to costs of **desensitisation therapy**

166     **_First_**, Dr Kannan was apparently the only doctor who recommended it, over more than 8.5 years of visits to doctors.

167     **_Second_**, I also do not consider the basis for this prescription to be persuasive. The desensitisation therapy was prescribed for foot numbness. However, P did not always complain of numbness to the doctors, and P did not actively seek therapy for it. It therefore appears to be something that does not bother P, and that P has come to grips with.

168     **_Third_**, this prescription first came in October 2016.[^161] However, there is no evidence that, in the years that elapsed, P has attended such therapy sessions. Neither was any explanation offered for it. I do not consider P to have any serious intention of going for such treatment. Accordingly, I dismiss this head of claim.

##### (5)   Pain management therapy

169    P is entitled to costs of **pain management therapy**.

170    I accept P’s claim that he is entitled to twice-yearly lifelong pain management therapy, on the basis that P is expected to have lifelong pain as a result of the accident. However, I do not accept Dr Kannan’s estimate of $225.00 per session for pain management therapy even though it is, as P submits, unchallenged in cross-examination, because it was expressed to be subject to the pain physician’s estimate. While Dr George did not give an estimate, P was charged $39.00 (after government subsidies) for his 2 most recent consultations with Dr George.[^162] P did not state any intention to change doctors, nor is there any good reason for the price of pain management therapy to increase so sharply. To be sure, I consider that Dr Kannan has not given sufficient detail to satisfy me if his idea of pain management therapy goes beyond the regular follow-up with Dr George which P has been attending.

171    P’s costs of pain management therapy works out to be $799.11. The detailed summation is found at Annex D.

![]([2021] SGDC 0103_Image/[2021] SGDC 0103_image4.png)

#### Psychological treatment

172    I award damages for psychological treatment at 15% × $3,779.00 = **$566.85**, this being parties’ common submission, which I accept.[^163]

#### Psychiatric treatment

173    P seeks $6,420.00 in future psychiatric treatment with Dr Lim.

174    P highlights Dr Lim’s unchallenged assessment that P is likely to require treatment for the next 5–10 years at 2-monthly intervals.[^164] Based on P’s latest invoices of $107.00, this works out to 10 years × 6 times/year × $107.00 × 15% = $963.00.

175    D argues that this claim must be disallowed because it was not claimed in the joint opening statement and, on that basis, D had dispensed with the cross-examination of Dr Lim.[^165] In this regard, P argues that Dr Lim’s medical report came only into existence after the opening statement had been filed, that the report was clear in its purport, and that D had reserved his right to cross-examine Dr Lim.[^166]

176    However, I dismiss this claim on the basis that P did not claim it in the opening statement.

> (a)     P is not saved by the fact that Dr Lim’s opinion emerged after the opening statement was filed. The point is, P could have stated that he was making a claim for future psychiatric treatment at the point the supporting documents were admitted into evidence, but P did not do so. P did exactly that where some future orthopaedic treatment is concerned.

> (b)     The fact that Dr Lim’s opinion was clear, or that D reserved his right to cross-examine Dr Lim, does not save P from his failure to state that he is making a claim for it.

> (c)     For completeness, I find it of secondary importance that this is an item of general damages rather than special damages, because that determines whether a head of claim must be pleaded in the statement of claim (and not whether it must be claimed in the opening statement). The point is that Dr Lim’s report marks the first time that future psychiatric treatment is claimed and put into issue (and is not evidence that helps the Court decide an existing issue more fairly). (In my judgment, framing the issue as future medical expenses generally is at an overly high level of abstraction.) I therefore consider it unfair for P to maintain a claim for future psychiatric treatment.

177    If I am wrong on the pleading point, then I would have been inclined to award the costs of future psychiatric treatment. D argues that there is insufficient evidence to make an award. He highlights that Dr Lim had in fact said that it was difficult to make an estimate, that Dr Lim had given appointments at 2-monthly intervals (meaning, 2 months between each session or 4 sessions a year), that the treatment (if at all) could be as short as 5 years, and that there was no evidence as to a suitable multiplicand.[^167] In my view, Dr Lim ultimately gave an estimate of the duration of future treatment, even if he lamented the difficulty of doing so. I also consider that the treatment would be 6 times a year; to say that 2-monthly intervals means 4 sessions a year is to say that each treatment session lasts 1 month—a premise I find untenable. I also accept P’s submission that the cost would have been $107.00. I would have been inclined to award the midpoint, _ie_, 7.5 years. This would have worked out to be $607.21:

## Income-related losses

178    P claims that, but for the accident, he would not have suffered a variety of income-related losses, which I will address in 2 categories: shipboard allowances and earnings generally. P is a navy military expert (“ME”) under the Military Domain Experts Scheme (“MDES”) who, at the time of the accident, held the ME2-2 rank (_ie_, the equivalent of a master sergeant). He would have been due to retire at 50 years old. However, he has been promoted to ME3-1 in 2017, with the consequence that his retirement age has been raised to 60 years old.

### Pre-AD and future loss in shipboard allowances

179    P claims the estimated loss in shipboard allowance, both pre-AD and future, at $21,250.00 and $16,800, respectively. P’s case is that this accident caused his PES (_ie_, Physical Employment Status) to be downgraded to PES E, with the consequence that P was ineligible for shipboard assignments. Otherwise, he would have had alternating land and ship tours, each for 2 years at a time. Since he last left his ship tour in 2007–2008, P’s claim is that he would have been on ship tours in 2011–2012, 2015–2016, 2019–2020, 2023–2024 and 2027–2028 (_ie_, before P’s retirement in 2029). According to P, his shipboard allowance is $450.00 per month when on board a ship (or $350.00 per month in 2011), and $100.00 when not. This leads to his computations of:

> (a)     $250.00 + ($450.00/month – $100.00/month) × 12 months/year × 5 years = **$21,250.00** in pre-AD losses for 2011–2020; and

> (b)     ($450.00/month – $100.00/month) × 12 months/year × 4 years = **$16,800.00** in future losses for 2023–2028.

180    Broadly, I allow these claims, save for some differences in my method of computation.

181     **First**, I reject D’s argument that this head of claim is not pleaded despite being one for special damages and therefore must be dismissed.[^168] While this head of claim was not pleaded, P highlights that he had withdrawn an application to amend the statement of claim (“SOC”) to plead this head of claim upon D’s confirmation that the claim for lost shipboard earnings, having arisen post-writ (even if before the AD), were in issue despite not being pleaded.[^169] The exchange went as follows:

> PC:    Asking for leave to withdraw, no order as to costs. \[DC\] has agreed not to take issue with it. He thinks the matters I want to amend need not be amended because they arise post-writ. Then there is no need to amend; \[D\] is fully aware. Of course \[D\] can still object that they are losses incurred as a result of this application.

> DC:    Confirm. Our view is that, technically, amendment should not be allowed because these events are post-writ. But the matters are in issue; we can argue it through the AD.

182    Although D cited _Lee Mui Yeng_ at \[61\]–\[66\] for the proposition that pre-AD loss of earnings must be explicitly pleaded, I find this inapplicable here because D has, in the above exchange, waived his objection on a pleading point. More fundamentally, the point of pleadings is to give D notice of the items that P intended to claim at trial (_Lee Mui Yeng_ at \[62\], citing _The “Shravan”_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 2 SLR(R) 713</span> _per_ Chao Hick Tin J (as he then was)). In this case, D no doubt had notice of these items.

183     **Second**, D argues in substance that the accident did not cause any loss of shipboard allowance because P had, before this accident, suffered another injury which caused his PES to be downgraded from A to C9L2 and which consequently caused him to be ineligible for shipboard assignments.[^170] I reject this argument.

184    Whereas P provided documentary evidence that PES E servicemen are not ship-deployable, there was no evidence apart from P’s testimony on whether PES C9L2(N1) servicemen were ship-deployable. I am not persuaded by D’s focus on a portion in cross-examination, where P supposedly conceded that only PES A and B servicemen may serve on a ship.

185    I begin by considering the relevant part of P’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”):

> 41.    Prior to the accident, my PES status was A. As a result of my injuries sustained by the accident, I have been downgraded to C9, N1, L2.

> 42.    As a career in the Navy requires one to be fit, it is evident that my career in the Navy has been affected. **If I am not sea worthy or deployable**, my career would be stagnated.

> 43.    I am required to stand and walk on my feet for prolonged periods as well as lift and transport heavy items such as ammunition and rations to and from the wharf and the ship. I am required to carry these heavy items while crossing a narrow gangway. I am also required to assist the technicians with the washing down of the ships and fueling hoses which are extremely heavy.

> 44.    Due to my injuries and residual disabilities … I now walk with a limp and am unable to stand and walk for prolonged periods and lift heavy items. I also continue to experience pain in my wrist. This causes me to carry out tasks slower and thereby affects my efficiency at work. My overall fitness, strength endurance have been affected, leading to difficulties in carrying out the tasks that my job demands.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

In his 1st supplementary AEIC of 6 November 2012, P said:

> A.     Downgrade in PES status

> 32.    My current Physical Employment Status (PES) is C9 N1. I wish to clarify that this was my PES status about 3 months prior to the accident. I was mistaken when I stated at paragraph 41 of my first affidavit that my PES status was downgraded as a result of the accident. I have managed to hold off any downgrade since the accident but this is inevitable.

> 33.    I went for medical review on 17 May 2012 at the Military Medical Institute (MMI) at National University Hospital. **In that review, I requested the medical board not to further downgrade me to PES ‘E’ in order to be deployable in the Navy. If I were to be downgraded further, my job will be affected as I would no longer be a combatant or sea deployable** and may be asked to leave the Navy or be given the ‘Golden Handshake’ in the event of a downturn in the economy, since there would be no purpose for me to render any services to the Navy.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

186    The salient portions in P’s cross-examination went as follows:

> Q:    To be deployed on ship, must be combat fit?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    Only PES A and PES B can go on a ship?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    PES C cannot?

> A:    Cannot.

> Q:    When you were downgraded to PES C in 2010, you cannot be deployed a ship?

> A:    Still deployable because of terms in service. There are a lot of PES C statuses. Certain status can go, certain status cannot go.

> Q:    But I asked you just now, you said PES C cannot go on a ship.

> A:    Some PES Cs can go. You must see N9 or L9 or whatever behind. Some who are excused limbs cannot climb onto the ship. The L status determines whether you can go on a ship.

187    In my view, the clear and unqualified answers to the first 3 questions above are damaging to P’s initial position, and it might be thought that these answers are more truthful and reliable than those to the questions that followed, because the later questions sought to apply the general principle to P’s circumstances with the apparent aim of refuting P’s claim for loss of shipboard earnings. However, I would not be persuaded by this. **_First_**, in my judgment, P would have been alive to the implications of these questions since he had already deposed in his 1st supplementary affidavit that a downgrade beyond his current PES would make him no longer sea-deployable. In other words, I do not regard P as suddenly realising on the stand where D’s cross-examination was going and changing tack. Instead, I regard P as having given general answers which he qualified when he was given the chance to elaborate. **_Second_**, P’s clarifications were both near-immediate and reasoned. **_Third_**, in re-examination (which concluded with D raising no further issues), P reiterated that he was graded PES C but remained ship-deployable, and it was only upon a further downgrade to PES E that he was non-deployable.[^171]

188    D raised another portion of cross-examination, where P said that personnel on board a ship had to carry heavy loads, to argue that it was “common sense” that a person with slipdisc would not be ship-deployable.[^172] D also highlighted Dr Chang’s opinion, given in 2016, that there was a distinct possibility that P’s degenerative disc disease would have made P unfit for shipboard duty.[^173] The cross-examination, in (what I think was) its proper context, went as follows:

> Q:    \[On board\] \[_The RSS_\] _Kallang_, you were a buffer?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    As a buffer you do all these things?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    Is that part of a buffer’s job?

> A:    No.

> Q:    It is those strictly speaking not part of a buffer’s job, but everyone helps when needed?

> A:    I can’t carry weight alone. It’s fairly heavy – my job, my on-board ship professionalism is navigation. But when it comes to this, on board ship, everyone rotates to do this. I need to fire a gun during wartimes – even cooks have to fire the guns if they have to. In port station, the officers will be doing other things. My vocation is a navigator. But my buffer is a secondary appointment.

189    I am unpersuaded by this. Neither Dr Chang nor P sit on the medical panel which assesses P’s fitness for the purpose of deployment. P is ultimately a layperson and his comments on what shipboard personnel do (or are required to do) are more fairly read as general statements than a concession in substance that P’s back condition would have made him ineligible for shipboard duty. Even as at 2019, Dr Chang also did not consider P’s back to have actually degenerated to the point that he would have been ineligible for shipboard duty.

190    In the final analysis, I do not consider D’s cross-examination to have sufficiently discredited P. In other words, I accept P’s evidence that his downgrade to PES E is sufficient to make P non-ship-deployable, but I do not find sufficient evidence for D’s position that P’s earlier PES of C9L2 makes P non-ship-deployable.

191    I turn to the quantum of the award. I accept P’s evidence that he would have spent his time equally divided between land and sea assignments. I find, at the time of the accident, that P had served the Navy for nearly 24 years, and his cumulative sea-time had been nearly 11.5 years.[^174] However, shipboard allowances were increased from $300.00 to $450.00 only with effect from July 2012,[^175] and not (as P says) from $350.00 to $450.00 in January 2012. In other words, of the 4 years (or 48 months) of lost shipboard allowance, P would have received the lower rate for 18 months.

192    I would therefore allow the claim for lost shipboard allowances at $35,193.84, as follows:

> (a)     Pre-AD losses at $18,300.00:

>> (i)       ($300.00/month – $100.00/month) × 18 months = $3,600.00 for the period January 2011–June 2012;

>> (ii)       ($450.00/month – $100.00/month) × 42 months = $14,700.00 for the period July 2012 to 2019;

> (b)     Future losses at $16,893.84 (for which the detailed summation is at Annex E):

>> (i)       ($450.00/month – $100.00/month) × 12 months / (1 + 4.25%)1 = $4,028.78 for 2020;

>> (ii)       ($450.00/month – $100.00/month) × 24 months × ( \[1 / (1 + 4.25%)4\] + \[1 / (1 + 4.25%)5\] ) = $6,966.76 for 2023–2024; and

>> (iii)       ($450.00/month – $100.00/month) × 24 months × ( \[1 / (1 + 4.25%)8\] + \[1 / (1 + 4.25%)9\] ) = $5,898.30 for 2027–2028.

193    Two matters will probably not escape parties’ notice.

> (a)      **First**, the shipboard allowances for 2023–2028 have been discounted. This, in my judgment, more faithfully reflects the time value of money and the possibility that other events might otherwise have rendered P ineligible for shipboard duties. I have applied the same 4.25% discount rate here, based on _Pollmann_, as I have for future medical expenses.

> (b)      **Second**, I have awarded more future losses than has been claimed. However, this arises because I have characterised losses for 2020—which P claimed as pre-AD losses—to be future losses for the purpose of calculation. In my view, there is no prejudice since the substance of the claim has been put in issue.

### Pre-AD loss of income

194    P claims the estimated lost income (plus CPF contributions) as a result of career stagnation at $46,230.00. P’s submission (corrected of its errors) was that he was promoted only in July 2017, _ie_, about 6.5 years after the accident, to the ME3-1 rank, but that he would have received his promotion much earlier (specifically, by January 2012) but for the accident, considering that all the servicemen in his cohort had been promoted except him and that some juniors had outranked him. Accordingly, P has lost the marginal difference in salary for the 67 months by which his promotion was delayed. P submits that he has as a result lost ($4,855.00/month – $4,165.00/month) × 67 months = $46,230.00.[^176] D denies this claim on the basis P would have been promoted by January 2012,[^177] and considers P’s claim to be speculative.

195    I agree with D that there is little direct evidence apart from P’s assertion that he would have been promoted by January 2012 but for the accident.[^178] That said, when P would have been promoted but for the accident is a question that does not admit of an easy answer.

196     **First**, the Navy’s replies to P’s letters stated that promotions were based on an individual’s performance and current estimated potential (“CEP”), and _not_ based on a comparison with the cohort or influenced by a PES downgrade.[^179] However, I am not prepared to treat this answer as definitive, since the Navy’s position is that the MDES is a uniformed military scheme and all military experts are required to be physically fit to perform their role, and are liable to take an individual physical proficiency test,[^180] and fitness and PES deployability are two basic soldiering criteria that will be considered in whether medically downgraded servicemen may transit to the MDES.[^181] The Navy also stated that it had sufficient shore appointments to cater for medically downgraded servicemen, many of whom had been promoted to the next higher rank where they continued to perform well and demonstrated potential to hold higher appointments.[^182] I can accept that the fact remains that the accident has caused P to be ineligible to perform and compete for promotions in appointments that are shipboard or require combat fitness, but ultimately I can only make little of this point because there was no evidence on what P’s performance grade were/ought to be, where/if P had a shipboard assignment and, accordingly, I cannot safely infer that P’s performance on a shipboard posting would have been better.

197     **Second**, I find that P’s performance after the accident did not slip compared to his pre-accident performance.

> (a)     P’s performance in the 2 years after the accident (_ie_, 2011–2012) remained in the same band as that in the 2 years before the accident (_ie_, 2009–2010): P was in the bottom 5th–20th percentile of ranked servicemen,[^183] which was equivalent to a “low C”.[^184]

> (b)     The Navy did not disclose P’s performance grading for 2013 and the years after. However, I find that generally it did not worsen.

>> (i)       By P’s own evidence, if he had slipped to the next band (_ie_, to the 96th–100th percentile), he would not have been entitled to a performance bonus.[^185] This happened only in 2019 (_ie_, in respect of work done for 2018) because P, not having attended work for at least 6 months, could not be graded in the first place. In all other years, P received a performance bonus[^186] which, in fact, increased year-on-year.

>> (ii)       P in fact surmised that he would have had better performance in 2013–2015 (or, I think, possibly in 2016) than in 2012, given that he was selected for the warrant officer course, which he thought he would not have qualified for based on his 2009–2012 grading.[^187] Based on his testimony, he would have needed 3 years of good performance to progress in his career.[^188]

> (c)     D submits that P did not start out with stellar performance grading before the accident,[^189] presumably to say that it is unsafe to infer that a promotion would have been due sooner rather than later. While that argument has force, I also think that an officer’s performance in the same rank can and should improve with time (all other things equal) as he becomes more adept at his role, and P did indeed perform better in the years that followed. The question, ultimately, is whether D’s performance _would have been better_ but for the accident.

198    In this regard, P did not lead evidence from his witness—his commanding officer for 2011–2017—to say that P would have been due or recommended for a promotion in 2012. There was also no indirect evidence, such as what matters informed P’s ranking (or the assessment of P’s performance) in the years following the accident, whether the accident (or his protracted medical leave) had in some way affected his ranking even if it did not displace him from the same performance band, or whether P’s CEP had changed for the worse after the accident such that his chances of promotion would be adversely affected.

199     **Finally**, P conceded that his enrolment in and completion of a course, on which his promotion was conditional, was sometimes a matter of luck because the decision was undertaken at the fleet and formation levels even if the recommendation was given at the unit level.

200    However, as against the above, I note that P was placed on medical leave for a few protracted periods—principally, P was on continuous medical leave in January–March 2011, October 2012–April 2013, and February 2015–January 2016.[^190] This is a period of some 21 months. Even in the absence of direct evidence from P’s superiors, I would infer that P lost substantial opportunities in displaying his performance and potential compared to his colleagues, with the consequence that P’s performance assessment and career advancement would have been adversely affected (even if P did not quite prove that he would have been promoted by January 2012). For example, in March 2016 (_ie_, after P came back from long medical leave), the increase in P’s performance bonus was minimal compared to the previous year. It is difficult to quantify P’s loss, especially considering that there is little evidence as to what P’s salary might have been had he performed better but remained at the ME2-2 rank, but I find that it would be unfair to award P nothing at all, as if he has suffered no loss at all.

201    On the assumption that P is promoted only 1 year earlier (_ie_, being the minimum time by which P’s promotion could have been accelerated), he would have earned $8,717.06 more, since he would have gotten:

> (a)     12 months × ($4,755.00/month – $4,605.00/month) = $1,800.00 more for the period July 2016 to June 2017 (based on P’s salary differential for July 2017–June 2018);

> (b)     13 months × ($4,988.33/month – $4,755.00/month) = $3,033.29 more for the period July 2017 to July 2018 (based on P’s salary differential for July 2018–July 2019); and

> (c)     11 months × ($5,341.40/month – $4,988.33/month) = $3,883.77 more for the period August 2018 to June 2019 (based on P’s salary differential in August 2019).

202    The loss for the period July–December 2019 is unknown as P’s increment, which would be announced in July–August 2020, is not known at the time of the AD. These losses have assumed that P would receive the same merit increments even if he was promoted 1 year earlier. As against the possibility that P would have received lower merit increments, I would think that P would suffer a larger loss than I have calculated above, as long as P received a merit increment on or after July 2020. These losses also do not I also note that, even though P was promoted in 2017, he returned to work for the period of June 2016–April 2018 (a further 22 months) at his commanders’ behest, despite being on medical leave.[^191] In my view, this goes beyond what the law requires of P; had P not done that, his career progression might have been even more adversely affected and his losses would have been even greater. Even considering the difficulties with the state of P’s evidence, I consider it conservative enough to make an award on the premise that P was promoted only 1 year earlier. I will therefore award P $8,717.06 in recompense of his pre-AD lost income.

### LEC

203    P claims $150,000.00 in LEC. P submits that he falls into the first category of cases identified in _Teo Sing Keng v Sim Ban Kiat_ <span class="citation">\[1994\] 1 SLR(R) 340</span>, _ie_, where P, although not having suffered any loss of earnings, is at risk of losing his employment and be at a disadvantage of getting an equally well-paid job. D, however, submits that P should be awarded only $10,000.00 in LEC, considering that he is not at substantial risk of losing his employment before he reaches 60 years old, and that his competitive disadvantage thereafter (at least that attributable to the accident) is essentially not significant because his age would have prevented him from taking on jobs that place physical demands on him.

204    While I am inclined to D’s view that P is not at great risk of losing employment before he turns 60, this does not necessarily mean that P suffers no loss in earning capacity for this period. As I alluded to above, I find that the accident has caused P to be less able to compete for a promotion (and, by extension, a higher salary) while in the Navy. That is still a loss, even if it is more difficult to prove or quantify.

205    In assessing P’s loss of earnings, I find the following considerations relevant.

206     **First**, P conceded that he remained eligible for a promotion to ME3-2 and ME3-3,[^192] and that he would be appointed into a role with a higher establishment such that he was promotable.[^193]

207     **Second**, and nonetheless, I consider P to be at a low to moderate competitive disadvantage when compared to his able-bodied colleagues, in terms of achieving a good performance (and, accordingly, merit-based increments and/or promotions) within the Navy.

208     **_To begin_**, I find that the scope of work that P can do is reduced. P’s long-term ability and capacity for work is limited by at least 3 matters.

> (a)      _One_: P is suffering from chronic pain that is disproportional to what can reasonably be expected of his injury and treatment. In my judgment, this will detract from the energy and focus he can have at work.

> (b)      _Two_: P is left with a foot with very limited range of movement and reduced power and stability, and which is becoming increasingly arthritic. Essentially, P can no longer do strenuous physical activity involving the legs, and cannot sit and stand for long periods, and cannot squat.

> (c)      _Three_: P has not recovered from dysthymia and will still have to receive both psychiatric and psychological treatment for some time.

209     **_Next_**, D argues that P is not a manual worker,[^194] whereas P essentially argues that he is a uniformed serviceman who is generally expected to be fit, and to take up rotational land and sea appointments in the ordinary course of events.[^195] In my view, neither position is entirely persuasive. These arguments hint at a false dichotomy. Even in the Navy, P might not be involved in work that is typically regarded as manual, but the point is that his disability makes it more difficult for him to perform work that is anything but entirely sedentary. Thus, for example, P would when compared to able-bodied colleagues be unable to assume appointments that require physical fitness, and P no longer bears the risks and rewards of being assessed on his physical performance. When he retires from the Navy, he will also face more difficulty doing the job of a security guard during patrols, or a supervisor to the extent he is required to be on his feet. I have discussed at \[196\] above why I consider P to be somewhat disadvantaged even if the Navy has been accommodating as regards P’s injury. I also think that even after P retires from the Navy, he will be disadvantaged compared to able-bodied colleagues. In this regard, I do not expect the average employer to be anywhere as accommodating as the Navy. As D acknowledges, the Navy has been “very accommodating”.[^196] On the other hand, as D highlights, P’s skill in the Navy includes his experience and know-how.[^197] In this regard, P testified that he was involved in a major project after the accident, which according to him was adopted by the entire Navy.[^198] His self-professed interests are in teaching, supervision, and automobiles. In other words, P has displayed proficiency and interest in areas which do not place great demands on his physical fitness.

210     **_Finally_**, I also broadly accept P’s submission that, for the remainder of P’s working life, the medical attention and treatment which P is expected to require (and attend) will detract from his opportunities to showcase his performance at work.[^199] Based on my findings above, in the near future, P will have to be treated by 4 departments:[^200] he must attend 6 physiotherapy sessions, 2 pain management consultations, 3 follow-up medical consultations, 6 psychiatric follow-ups (which I find are required, even if they have not been properly claimed), and 6 psychotherapy sessions. In my judgment, this is quite substantial. Towards the end of P’s working life, P is expected to require a revision of fusion surgery for his foot, following which P will have to be on medical leave, and I accept P’s submission that P’s expected absence from work is not a small convenience that one can assume that any employer will bear.

211     **Third**, I am not persuaded by D’s submission that P’s supposedly bleak outlook on post-military employment was due not to the accident but to his unreasonable disinterest in the options which were suitable for his physical condition.[^201]

212    I find P’s testimony truthful, measured, and reasonable for the most part.

213    D highlighted that P did not consider (or express much interest in) taking courses under the auspices of SkillsFuture—a government initiative to help mid-career personnel upgrade their skill set to remain employable—despite knowing about it. However, there are at least 4 counterpoints. _First_, P had already enrolled for another course on automotives at the Institute of Technical Education out of interest and was hoping to be employed as a supervisor in an automotive shop.[^202] In my view, this is a perfectly reasonable approach. _Second_, he had a wholly legitimate reason: the Navy already provides personnel with the options to take other courses so they would not have to do it outside.[^203]_Third_, P also said that he would consider SkillsFuture if he was unable to complete the automotive courses which truly interested him,[^204] and in substance it remained a last option.[^205] More generally, P said that he would upgrade himself subject to what his body allowed, and he would continue to find an alternative job post-retirement to provide for his wife and children.[^206]_Finally_, as P points out, P was simply responding to a line of questions,[^207] and in my judgment it would be unfair to P to read too much into it.

214    My assessment of P’s LEC for time he is expected to remain with the Navy is as follows.

215    Following from my views on P’s pre-AD loss of income, I will assume that P is already earning $150.00 less than his peers per month. This represents the minimum yearly salary increment while P is in his rank (corresponding to P’s salary increment in July 2017), and accounts for what I consider to be his slowed career advancement. I will expect that this amount will increase with time, to reflect the increasing gap expected between P and his able-bodied colleagues as a result of a sustained competitive disadvantage. In this regard, I will apply an increase of $15/month per year, with the result that, by the year of P’s retirement (_ie_, 2029), he will be earning $285.00/month less than his colleagues. This, in my estimation, will represent approximately 5–6% of P’s salary, assuming that P continues to receive some increments in the following years as he expects. As for my assessment of P’s LEC between age 60 and 67, I will assume that P is disadvantaged in the region of $500.00/month. This will represent approximately 9–10% of P’s salary immediately before retirement. This increased percentage takes into account the fact that P’s next employer is unlikely to be as accommodating as the Navy, and that towards the end of P’s working life he will need another surgery which I consider will put him on extended medical leave. In my judgment, these are fair estimates of what P’s loss would be.

216    This works out to be $43,948.30. The detailed summation is at Annex F.

## Property damage

### Repairs

217    P claims $729.50 for the repairs to his motorcycle.

218    D argues that no award should be made, because:

> (a)     the repair bill is hearsay, since P did not call the repairers (being the makers of the document) to testify;[^208] and

> (b)     there was no survey report.[^209]

219    In my view, the repair bill is not hearsay. The point is that P deposed that his motorcycle was damaged, and he was invoiced $729.50 for the repair costs. These are matters within P’s personal knowledge.

220    However, there are two key problems, which begins with the premise that O 18 r 13(4) ROC deems any allegation of the existence and quantum of damage to be traversed and therefore put to proof. **First**, it is not clear from P’s affidavit that P is actually out of pocket by $729.50, because P does not actually depose that he has paid for the repair bill. It is unclear what the true arrangement is, as far as payment is concerned. For example, it might turn out that P need not pay the full sum on the invoice, because of some discount or waiver. **Second**, I am persuaded by D’s point that there was no survey report. The consequence is that I am unable to satisfy myself as to the extent that the claimed items were caused by the accident, and the extent to which the quantum of each claimed item was reasonable.

221    Nonetheless, I can accept that the motorcycle is obviously damaged—in my judgment, the photos show obvious damage to at least 5 distinct parts of the motorcycle.[^210] I can also accept that, whatever P’s arrangement with the repairer is, he has suffered a loss and at any rate would not have gotten repairs for free. I therefore award P a nominal sum of $250.00 (_ie_, $50.00 per part) for diminution in value of his motorcycle.

### Loss of use

222    I award damages for loss of use at $30.00, this being parties’ common submission, which I accept.[^211]

## Concluding orders

223    In the premises, I assess damages and enter final judgment for $214,030.08.

224    Pre-judgment interest shall run on damages, from the date of writ to the date of judgment, as follows:

> (a)     on $88,280.00 (_ie_, damages for pain and suffering and property damage), at 5.33% per annum; and

> (b)     on $38,699.73 (_ie_, damages for pre-AD medical and transport expenses, and loss of shipboard allowance and income), at 2.67% per annum.

225    Costs of the action are to be taxed unless parties agree on costs or either party files costs submissions within 1 month (in which case costs will be fixed in lieu of taxation).
