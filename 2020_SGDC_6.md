\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9318/2019/01 .\]

8 January 2020

### District Judge Ong Chin Rhu:

## BACKGROUND

The Accused, Mr Ayup Khan s/o M Kader Sultan, _claimed trial_ to 3 charges under section 8(b)(ii), section 8(a) and section 9 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”) respectively (“proceeded charges”).

2       At the conclusion of the trial, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him of all 3 charges. Thereafter, the Accused _pleaded guilty_ to a charge under Regulation 15(3)(f) of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (Rg 3, 1999 Rev Ed) for failing to present himself for urine test (“PG charge”).

3       I sentenced the Accused to a global term of 7 years’ and 13 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane, as well as an enhanced sentence of 240 days’ imprisonment under section 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act (Cap 247, Rev Ed 2000)_._ The Accused being dissatisfied with his _conviction_ has filed an appeal. He did not apply for bail pending appeal and is currently _serving sentence_.

4       I had provided brief oral grounds at the conclusion of the trial to explain some of my findings and my decision to convict the Accused. These are captured in the Transcripts for 8 November 2019 at pages 2 to 11. As the Accused had _appealed only against his conviction_, I shall focus, in these grounds, on elaborating on the reasons for my finding of guilt in this case, in relation to the 3 proceeded charges under the MDA.

## PROCEEDED CHARGES

5       The details of the 3 proceeded charges against the Accused were as follows:

> DAC-927797-2018 (“the consumption charge”)

> and further,

> that you, from 16 December 2017 to 13 August 2019, were subject to a remission order made by the Commissioner of Prisons under Division 2 or 3 of Part VB of the Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2014 Rev Ed) which remission order is subject to the basic condition under s 50S(1) of the Prisons Act, and while the remission order is in effect you, on **7 August 2018**, committed the aforesaid offence and upon conviction and the imposition of a sentence reflected under s 50S(1)(b) of the Prisons Act, shall be deemed to have breached the basic condition of your remission order, and you are thereby liable to be punished under s 50T (1)(a) of the Prisons Act with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of **372 Days** from 7 August 2018 to 13 August 2019.

## UNDISPUTED FACTS AND THE ISSUES AT TRIAL

6       During the trial, it was not disputed that the Accused was arrested on 7 August 2018 at about 11.42am in a room at a hostel at Lorong 6 Geylang together with his wife and another female friend. The arrest report was admitted and marked as Exhibit P1 and a sketch of the layout of the room was admitted and marked as Exhibit P2.

7       Although the Accused claimed that he was “intoxicated” at the material time, and was unaware of his arrest as well as all subsequent events of that day, it was also generally not disputed that a packet of crystalline substance (Exhibit P4, photograph P3-1) and some drug consumption utensils (Exhibits P5 to P10, photographs P3-2 to P3-7) were recovered from the toilet attached to the room.

8       The Accused also did not dispute the fact that after he was brought to CNB Bedok Division on the day of his arrest, his urine specimens were procured in accordance with the procedures set out in the First Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs (Urine Specimens and Urine Tests) Regulations (Cap 185, Rg 6, 1999 Ed.), and that the Instant Urine Test (“IUT”) found his urine to be positive for opiate and amphetamine (Exhibit D1).

9       Further, it was not disputed that the Accused’s urine specimens were subsequently sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis. Two certificates (Exhibits P19 and P20) were issued under section 16 of the MDA by the Analysts from the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory, namely Ms Bellene Chung (PW10) and Ms Tan Joo Chin (PW11), stating that his urine samples contained methamphetamine.

10     It was also not disputed that the packet of crystalline substance (Exhibit P4) was submitted by SSgt Shazrel Afnor Bin Shafii (PW7) to the Illicit Drugs Laboratory of HSA for analysis. The Analyst, Ms Jesslyn Oh Su Yun (PW9 – “Ms Jesslyn Oh”), issued a certificate under section 16 of the MDA (Exhibit 18) stating that the exhibit was found to be “one packet containing not less than 0.04 gram of crystalline substance which was analysed and found to contain methamphetamine”.

11     The prosecution’s case, in essence, was that the Accused had knowingly consumed methamphetamine prior to his arrest. In addition, the packet of crystalline substance (Exhibit P4) and drug utensils (Exhibits P5 to P10) belonged to him and were in his possession.

12     The Accused, on the other hand, took the position that he had not knowingly consumed methamphetamine. He was also not the owner and was not in possession of Exhibits P4 to P10.

## THE CASE FOR THE PROSECUTION

13     The prosecution called 11 witnesses to prove their case against the Accused. Their evidence is summarised below.

#### The arrest and seizure of the drug exhibits

14     Station Inspector Teo Kwee Peng (PW1 – “SI Teo”) and Senior Staff Sergeant Lim Kai Siang Clinton (PW2 – “SSSgt Clinton”) were the arresting officers. They testified that when the arresting party first entered the room at the hostel, the Accused’s wife (Ms Siti Nuraisyah Binte Abdullah – PW12, “Ms Siti”), and the other female subject were found in the room, while the Accused was at the balcony area.

15     SSSgt Clinton conducted a search and found Exhibits P4 to P10 in the attached toilet of the room. He placed Exhibit P4 in a ziploc bag and Exhibits P5 to P10 in another ziploc bag. SSSgt Clinton then showed the exhibits in the two bags to the Accused, Ms Siti and the other female subject, who were then seated on the bed in the room. SSSgt Clinton asked them who the seized exhibits belonged to. The Accused responded by saying that they belonged to him.

16     Both SI Teo and SSSgt Clinton testified that no medication was found in the room or the attached toilet. SI Teo also did not recall anyone bringing medication along to the police station after the arrest.

17     SI Teo and SSSgt Clinton further testified that during the arrest, the Accused looked “lucid” and “normal”. He was able to answer questions coherently and comply with their instructions. He did not appear sleepy or intoxicated.

18     The Accused’s wife, Ms Siti, also gave evidence regarding the arrest. Ms Siti stated that when a Chinese officer found the drug exhibits (which she described as “four syringes, one packet of power and a small bottle”) in the toilet and asked who they belonged to, the Accused admitted ownership. Ms Siti testified that her medications, which were prescribed by her doctor, were also found in the room. As the medications bore her name, one of the officers present had placed them together with her personal property.

19     According to Ms Siti, the Accused was able to speak coherently at the time of the arrest and was able to comply with the instructions of the officers. He also did not appear intoxicated. Ms Siti also testified that the exhibits seized from the toilet belonged to the Accused.

#### The urine procurement process

20     After the arrest, the Accused was brought to the CNB office at Bedok Police Division where his urine specimen was procured. As mentioned earlier in these grounds, the evidence given by the following witnesses pertaining to the urine procurement, collection and delivery processes were largely unchallenged by the Accused:

> (a)     PW3 – Sgt Muhammad Amirrudin, urine procurement escorting officer (“Sgt Amirrudin”)

> (b)     PW4 – Sgt Nur Shahirah Binte Abdul Jalil, IUT operator (“Sgt Shahirah”)

> (c)     PW5 – SSgt Jagan s/o Ganasekaran, urine sealing officer (“SSgt Jagan”)

> (d)     PW6 – Sgt Renukadevi d/o Bala, urine delivery officer on 8 August 2018.

21     As the prosecution has succinctly set out these officers’ evidence at \[11\] of their closing submissions, I do not propose to repeat the same in these grounds. However, I note that all the officers who had interacted with the Accused during the urine procurement and IUT processes did not detect any sign that the Accused was intoxicated. In particular, Sgt Amirrudin stated that the Accused complied with all his instructions during the procurement process and was able to provide his urine sample normally and properly. Sgt Shahirah confirmed that the Accused was able to verify his particulars on the IUT barcode label. SSgt Jagan also gave evidence that when he read out the Accused’s name and IC number and showed him the HSA labels containing his particulars, the Accused affirmed that they were correct and signed on the labels. The Accused was also able to deposit a bottle of his urine into each of the two holes in the metal urine box.

#### The Accused’s long statement

22     After the Accused’s urine samples were procured, Sgt Amirrudin escorted the Accused to SSSgt Clinton to have his statement recorded. The prosecution sought to admit the Accused’s long statement recorded by SSSgt Clinton on 7 August 2018 from 12.55pm to 2.10pm into evidence.

23     When I enquired with the Accused whether he was challenging the admissibility of this statement, the Accused confirmed that he was not aware of being subjected to any form of threat, inducement or promise in relation to the statement. His position was that he was intoxicated and was not aware that his statement was being recorded. That being the case, I agreed with the prosecution that pursuant to Explanation 2(b) to section 258(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (“CPC”), the statement was admissible, subject to the Accused’s challenge as to the weight to be given. Explanation 2(b) reads:

> “Explanation 2 — If a statement is otherwise admissible, it will not be rendered inadmissible merely because it was made in any of the following circumstances: …

>> (b)    when the accused was intoxicated;”

24     Hence, I admitted the Accused’s long statement into evidence as Exhibit P11.

#### The Accused’s cautioned statements

25     The Accused’s case was subsequently referred to SSSgt Muhammad Hafidh Bin Ramli (PW8 – “SSSgt Hafidh”) from the Investigation Division of CNB for follow up.

26     SSSgt Hafidh gave evidence that the Accused was sent to the Drug Rehabilitation Centre (“DRC”) for medical observation for 7 days after his arrest. Meanwhile, SSSgt Hafidh referred the drug exhibits to the exhibit management team for further action. He also proceeded to apply for the Accused’s Memorandum of Certified Previous Convictions (Exhibit P15), a copy of his Remission Order (Exhibit P16) and the CRS Summary Sheet (Exhibit P17).

27     Upon the Accused’s discharge from DRC on 14 August 2018, the Accused was referred to SSSgt Hafidh for his cautioned statements under section 23 of the Criminal Procedure Code to be taken. The prosecution sought to admit 3 cautioned statements of the Accused, recorded by SSSgt Hafidh on 14 August 2018 at the following times, and relating to the respective proceeded charges, into evidence:

> (a)     1.25pm – consumption charge;

> (b)     1.33pm – possession charge; and

> (c)     1.40pm – utensils charge.

28     As the Accused informed the Court that SSSgt Hafidh had promised to:

> (a)     try to speak to his superior to “waive” the possession charge;

> (b)     allow the Accused to speak to his wife; and

> (c)     allow the Accused to go on Court bail;

if the Accused “cooperated” with him, an ancillary hearing was held to determine the admissibility of these cautioned statements.

29     Having carefully reviewed and considered the testimony of SSSgt Haridh and the Accused during the ancillary hearing, I accepted SSSgt Haridh’s evidence that he did not make any of the alleged promises to the Accused in exchange for the Accused’s cooperation before or during the recording of the cautioned statements.

30     In my view, there was simply no reason for SSSgt Haridh to make such promises or offer such inducements to the Accused, before or during the recording of the statements. There was no evidence given to show that the Accused was uncooperative with investigations at any point of time since his arrest. Indeed, the contents of the Accused’s long statement (Exhibit P11) which was recorded on the day of his arrest, indicated that the Accused was forthcoming during investigations. Further, whether the Accused could have his possession charge “waived”, be allowed to speak to Ms Siti (who was under the charge of another investigating officer) or be granted Court bail, would also not be within SSSgt Haridh’s sole control. It would have been totally foolhardy for SSSgt Haridh to make such promises and take the risk that the Accused would raise a complaint soon thereafter if they were not fulfilled. The fact that the Accused was indeed allowed to speak to Ms Siti on that day, in the presence of SSSgt Haridh, did not, to my mind, indicate that such a promise was made to the Accused in exchange for his cooperation. I accepted SSSgt Haridh’s logical explanation that he had allowed the couple to speak with each other as he assessed that there was no risk of jeopardising investigations at that stage. He had also monitored their conversation to ensure that they did not discuss the details of the case.

31     Further it was pertinent to note that the Accused’s own testimony during the ancillary hearing indicated that the making of his cautioned statements were not “caused” by any of these alleged promises (see section 258(3) of the CPC). The Accused had repeatedly confirmed during cross-examination in the ancillary hearing that SSSgt Faridh’s alleged promises did not at all influence the contents of his cautioned statements. Instead, the Accused had understood “cooperation” to merely mean that he was to behave in a proper manner during the process of statement recording.

32     In view of the above, the 3 cautioned statements relating to the proceeded charges were admitted and marked as Exhibits P12 to P14 respectively.

#### The drug and urine analyses – evidence of the HSA Analysts

33     Ms Jesslyn Oh performed the analysis of the packet of crystalline substance (Exhibit P4) and issued the HSA certificate in Exhibit P18. During cross-examination, she explained that only qualitative analysis was performed and no quantitative analysis was done on Exhibit P4. Hence, the amount of methamphetamine in the exhibit was not stated in Exhibit P18. Ms Jesslyn Oh agreed with the Accused that pseudoephedrine and ephedrine, which were listed in the Third Schedule of the MDA, were used in the manufacture of methamphetamine. However, these two substances were not detected during the analysis of Exhibit P4.

34     Ms Bellene Chung performed the analysis on one of the Accused’s urine specimens and her findings were set out in the HSA certificate in Exhibit P19. She testified that the presence of methamphetamine in the Accused’s urine was consistent with the consumption of methamphetamine. During cross-examination, Ms Bellene Chung explained that the screening test of the Accused’s urine was positive for amphetamines. In the confirmation test, both the parent drug (methamphetamine) as well as the metabolite (amphetamine) were detected in the Accused’s urine. In fact, the concentration of methamphetamine in the Accused’s urine was 4390 ng/mL while the concentration of amphetamine was 326 ng/mL. This was above the 500 ng/mL of methamphetamine and 200 ng/mL of amphetamine positive reporting criteria for methamphetamine. Further, the confirmation test, which was conducted using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, would be able to differentiate between different amphetamines, including pseudoephedrine, ephedrine or methamphetamine. Thus, pseudoephedrine and ephedrine would not produce false positive confirmation test results for methamphetamine.

35     Ms Bellene Chung also gave evidence that as controlled drugs, dextromethamphetamine and levmetamfetamine (both isomers of methamphetamine) would not be available over the counter in Singapore. However, consumption of these controlled drugs may produce methamphetamine in the urine. Specifically if someone sniffed levmetamfetamine, it might give rise to methamphetamine in the urine.

36     Ms Bellene Chung clarified that only opiates and amphetamines tests were requested for the Accused’s urine specimen. As such, HSA had only conducted tests for these 2 classes of drugs. She added that codeine and morphine were also detected in the Accused’s urine and the conclusion upon analysis of the test results, was that this was due to codeine consumption instead of morphine consumption.

37     In response to the Accused’s queries during cross-examination, Ms Bellene Chung explained that consumption of the Robitussin cough syrup containing pseudoephedrine would not give rise to methamphetamine in the urine as pseudoephedrine would not metabolise in the human body into methamphetamine. This was so even though pseudoephedrine was used in the manufacture of methamphetamine, as the human body consumption process was different from the manufacturing process.

38     Ms Tan Joo Chin performed the analysis on the Accused’s other urine specimen and her findings were as stated in the HSA certificate in Exhibit P20. She testified that the concentration of methamphetamine in the urine sample she analysed was 4920ng/mL of urine. During cross-examination, she stated that methamphetamine was the parent drug and not the metabolite of methamphetamine. One of the metabolites of methamphetamine was amphetamine.

39     Ms Tan Joo Chin also testified that when ephedrine or pseudoephedrine was consumed by a person, it could not be converted or metabolised into amphetamine or methamphetamine. As for the allowable difference in concentration of methamphetamine in the two urine specimens analysed by different Analysts, Ms Tan Joo Chin testified that it was plus or minus 20% of the average of the 2 results (“the 20% criteria”).

## THE CASE FOR THE DEFENCE

40     At the close of the prosecution’s case, I found that the prosecution had made out a prima facie case against the Accused on the proceeded charges and called upon the Accused to give evidence in his own defence. The Accused elected to testify, and he was the sole witness for the defence.

#### The consumption charge

41     With regard to the consumption charge, the Accused adopted a multi-pronged defence.

42     Firstly, the Accused raised what may be termed the “medicine” defence. He testified to the possibility that his urine was tested positive for methamphetamine due to the following medications he used, prior to his arrest:

> (a)     Robitussin (containing pseudoephedrine) which he consumed on 6 August 2018;

> (b)     Valium tablets which he purchased illegally from a “Burmese” man in Geylang and consumed on the day of his arrest; and

> (c)     Cough syrup which he bought from the same man and consumed on the day of his arrest.

43     In addition, while cross-examining the HSA experts, the Accused also alluded to himself “always” using the Vicks inhaler before his arrest.

44     The other main strand of the Accused’s defence to the consumption charge was his claim that, up to the day of his arrest, he had been residing in the Selarang Halfway House and had reported regularly for urine tests every Monday and Friday, as required by his drug supervision order. Hence, he could not and would not have knowingly consumed any controlled drugs prior to his arrest.

#### The possession and utensils charges

45     As for the possession and utensils charges, the Accused’s defence was that he was “not conscious” at the time of his arrest and was therefore not aware that the drugs and utensils were in the toilet.

46     Further, the Accused challenged the sufficiency of the evidence against him. In particular, the Accused pointed out that SSSgt Clinton, who recovered the packet of drugs and drug paraphernalia from the toilet, could not pinpoint where exactly he retrieved the items from. In addition, no photograph was taken before the items were seized, and no fingerprint or DNA analysis was performed on them.

#### The drug analyses and expert evidence

47     During cross-examination of the 3 HSA officers as well as in his closing submissions, the Accused also challenged the veracity of the HSA analyses and certificates, and the officers’ expert opinions. The Accused highlighted certain purported shortcomings and deficiencies in their evidence, including the following:

> (a)     The weight of the methamphetamine was not stated in the HSA certificate for the drug exhibit (Exhibit P18). Thus, the certificate was defective and the drug possession charge could not be made out.

> (b)     In relation to the certificates pertaining to urine analysis (Exhibits P19 and P20), the difference in the concentration of methamphetamine in the 2 urine samples analysed (which were 4920 and 4390 ng/mL respectively) was unacceptable. Instead, according to the Accused’s submissions, any difference in concentration between the 2 specimens should not exceed 40ng/mL. In addition, the Accused claimed that the consumption of methamphetamine would not give rise to methamphetamine in the urine as the metabolite of methamphetamine was amphetamine. As such, the Analysts had “lied” in their certificates when they stated incorrectly that methamphetamine was found in his urine. In addition, the Accused claimed that as pseudoephedrine was a substance used in the manufacture of methamphetamine, consumption of Robitussin containing pseudoephedrine would give rise to methamphetamine his the urine.

48     I pause here to observe that certain positions adopted by the Accused appeared to be conflicting. An example would be the Accused’s allegation that the Analysts had lied in the certificates when they stated that they found his urine to contain methamphetamine while insisting at the same time that his consumption of Robitussin containing pseudoephedrine the day before his arrest would give rise to methamphetamine in his urine.

## THE REBUTTAL EVIDENCE

49     In view of the Accused’s contention during the defence’s case that up to the date of his arrest, he was residing in the Selarang Halfway House and had reported regularly for urine tests every Monday and Friday, I allowed the prosecution’s application to adduce rebuttal evidence in this regard.

50     The prosecution proceeded to call the following 3 rebuttal witnesses to give evidence in relation to the Accused’s claims:

> (a)     PW13 – Tang Teck Kim, provost officer investigating cases in the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme

> (b)     PW14 – Quek Kwong Boon, Mandatory Aftercare Service Investigation Officer, Provost Unit

> (c)     PW15 – Sergeant Khairul Faiz bin Nasaruddin, urine supervision officer for the Accused.

51     The unchallenged evidence adduced through these witnesses showed that the Accused was no longer residing at Selarang Halfway House since 15 March 2018, several months before his arrest. The witnesses gave evidence that the Accused was placed under the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme upon his release from prison on 16 December 2017, and was initially required to reside at the Selarang Halfway House. On 15 March 2018, the Accused was discharged from the Halfway House and placed on home detention supervision (Exhibit P24). He was required to reside at his elder brother’s residence at Blk 673 Edgefield Plains and to remain indoors from 10pm to 6am. However, since April 2018, the Accused started to breach his curfew hours and did not return to his brother’s residence.

52     In addition, the Accused was placed under drug supervision for a period of 24 months with effect from 16 December 2017 and was required to present himself at Bedok Police Division HQ every Monday and Friday for urine tests, commencing from 18 December 2017 during his period of supervision (Exhibit P26). However, he had failed to report for his urine tests since 6 April 2018 (Exhibit P27).

## ANALYSIS OF THE EVIDENCE AND THE COURT’S FINDINGS

#### Omission to provide notice under section 231 CPC

53     Before I turn to analyse the substantive evidence in relation to the proceeded charges, I should first deal with the Accused’s submissions that the prosecution had omitted to serve the notice under section 231 of the CPC when calling Ms Siti as well as the rebuttal witnesses to give evidence.

54     While I agreed with the Accused that notice should have been given, I note, however, that the substantive evidence of Ms Siti and the rebuttal witnesses were largely unchallenged by the Accused.

55     In my view, this was clearly an administrative oversight on the part of the prosecution. Further, some notice had been given in open court of the prosecution’s intention to call these witnesses, prior to them taking the stand. In particular, the Transcripts for 28 August 2019 at page 26 showed that the prosecution had stated in open court before lunch break that they intended to call Ms Siti, and she took the stand on the following day. As for the rebuttal witnesses, the prosecution had also made the application to call rebuttal witnesses in open court at the close of the defence’s case (see Transcripts for 29 August 2019 at page 105). Thus, I would agree with the prosecution that the omission to provide written notice did not cause any actual prejudice to the Accused.

56     In any event, under section 283 of the CPC, the Court may, on its own motion, at the close of the case for defence, summon a person as a witness. In fact, the Court _must_ summon and examine such a person if it thinks his evidence is essential to making a just decision in the case.

57     During the case for the defence, the Accused had repeatedly testified and affirmed that he was residing in the Halfway House and reporting regularly for urine tests, up to the day of his arrest. The Accused also told the Court that the manager of the Halfway House would be able to confirm those facts. As I have explained in my oral grounds, had the prosecution elected not to all any witnesses to address these points, I would have been minded to exercise my powers to summon the relevant witnesses myself. In my view, the evidence of such witnesses would be essential for me to make a just decision in this case. Indeed, if, as the Accused claimed in his evidence, he was residing in Selarang Halfway House and regularly reported for urine tests up to the day of his arrest, it would be very much in the Accused’s interest to obtain such corroborative evidence to bolster his defence. This was especially so when these facts were easily and objectively verifiable.

58     Unfortunately, the evidence given by the rebuttal witnesses clearly demonstrated that the Accused was lying in Court when testifying in his own defence.

#### The Accused’s long statement

59     Next, I shall turn to the Accused’s statement in Exhibit P11, which was recorded about 2 hours after his arrest. To recap, the Accused did not make any allegation of threat, inducement or promise in relation to Exhibit P11. As mentioned earlier, he gave evidence instead that he was “intoxicated”, “high” and not “conscious” during his arrest, such that he was not even aware of the presence of the CNB officers in his hostel room, that he had been placed under arrest, was brought to Bedok Police Division, provided his urine samples in accordance with the requisite process, and gave a statement to a CNB officer. According to the Accused, he only regained consciousness the following day.

60     The Accused relied on the definition of “intoxication” in section 86(3) of the Penal Code and pointed to his positive IUT results in support of his claim of being “unconscious”. During his examination-in-chief, the Accused also pointed to certain alleged discrepancies in P11 to cast doubt on its authenticity and reliability. These included the portion of the statement (paragraph 1) where it was stated that he had been staying at the hostel in Geylang for about 4 months, as well as paragraph 3 where it was stated that the Accused had last consumed “Ice” in the toilet of the hostel on 5 August 2018. The Accused testified that these could not possibly be true as he had all along been residing at the Selarang Halfway House as well as reported regularly for urine tests up to the day of his arrest.

61     Against the Accused’s claim that he was intoxicated to the state of “unconsciousness”, we had the evidence of five witnesses (including that of Ms Siti), who dealt with or were present with the Accused at various times after his arrest, prior to the recording of P11. They consistently testified that the Accused appeared lucid or normal, that he was speaking and responding coherently to questions asked, and was able to comply with various instructions. It was also pertinent to note that the Accused did not dispute that he managed to follow all the instructions in the urine procurement process, including obtaining the bottles, providing his urine into the large bottle, pouring his urine into the 2 smaller bottles, capping the bottles, verifying his particulars and signing on the HSA labels.

62     In addition, the Accused admitted that he signed and wrote his own NRIC number against his signatures on all three pages of P11. In my view, there was overwhelming evidence that the Accused, despite the presence of drugs in his body, was not rendered “unconscious” on the day of his arrest as he claimed. Further, the evidence showed that he was lucid and fully capable of giving a statement voluntarily.

63     In addition, the contents of his statements were corroborated by objective evidence including the unchallenged evidence of the rebuttal witnesses that he had been discharged from Selarang Halfway House and placed on home detention supervision since 15 March 2018 but had failed to return to his designated place of residence since 6 April 2018. Further, he had defaulted from his urine test obligations since 6 April 2018 as well. Indeed, P11 also contained details known only to the Accused, such as when he first met his wife. There was simply no reason for the recording officer to conjure up such personal information in the statement. Thus, I found that the contents of Exhibits P11 were provided by the Accused voluntarily and placed full weight on it.

#### The possession and utensils charges

64     Next, I shall deal with the Accused’s defence in relation to the possession and utensils charges. The Accused’s defence was a bare denial. While he attempted to question the cogency and sufficiency of the evidence against him, it was clear to me that there was more than enough evidence to prove these two charges against him beyond a reasonable doubt.

65     Firstly, we had the evidence of SSSgt Clinton Lim that the crystalline substance and drug utensils were recovered in the toilet of the room occupied by the Accused, Ms Siti and a female friend. Secondly, according to both SSSgt Clinton and Ms Siti, the Accused had admitted ownership of the items when they were shown to him at the scene. Thirdly, in Exhibit P11, the Accused gave a detailed account concerning both the crystalline substance and the drug utensils and admitted ownership (see paragraphs 2, 4 and 5 of Exhibit P11). Finally, Ms Siti also confirmed in her evidence that the seized items belonged to the Accused and her evidence was not challenged by the Accused.

66     With regard to the Accused’s submissions that the nett weight of methamphetamine was not available or stated in the HSA certificate and hence the charge cannot be made out, this was, in my view, a non-starter. As mentioned by the prosecution in their response, there was simply no requirement in law or procedure to specify the pure weight of the drugs in a certificate under section 16 MDA.

#### The consumption charge

67     Next, I shall turn to the Accused’s defence in relation to the drug consumption charge. I propose to first touch on the Accused’s challenge against the reliability of the urine analyses.

68     As highlighted by the prosecution in their closing submissions at \[14\], Exhibits P19 and P20, being certificates issued under section 16 of the MDA, were presumptive proof of all the matters stated therein. The onus thus fell upon the Accused to prove that the matters contained therein were inaccurate and/or should not be relied upon (**_Tan Chin Hock v PP_** <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGCA 49</span> at \[26\]). Having examined the evidence, I agreed with the prosecution that the Accused had failed to do so.

69     Firstly, the Accused’s allegation that HSA’s 20% criteria in relation to the difference in concentration of methamphetamine found in the 2 urine specimens, was unacceptable and only a 40ng/mL difference was allowed, was completely without basis and unsupported by any evidence.

70     Secondly, the Accused’s insistence that the consumption of methamphetamine would not result in methamphetamine (but only amphetamine) in the urine, was similarly unsupported by any evidence. The Analysts had clearly testified that methamphetamine detected in the urine was consistent with consumption of methamphetamine. Ms Bellene Chung had explained in her evidence that 4390 ng/mL of methamphetamine and 326 ng/mL amphetamine was detected in the Accused’s urine. This passed the criteria for reporting the urine to be positive for methamphetamine as there was more than 500 ng/mL of methamphetamine and more than 200 ng/mL of amphetamine found.

71     Further, as the urine tests were conducted in accordance with section 31(4)(b) of the MDA, the presumption in section 22 of the MDA applied. Consequently, both the _actus reas_ and _mens rea_ of the Accused consuming methamphetamine were presumed, and the burden shifted on the Accused to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he did not knowingly consume methamphetamine (**_Mohammad Ashik bin Aris v PP_** <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGCA 46</span> at \[10\] and \[46\]; **_Cheng Siah Johnson v PP_** <span class="citation">\[2002\] SGHC 84</span> at \[15\]). The Accused attempted to do so by way of his “medicine” defence.

72     In relation to the purported use of the Vicks inhaler, I noted that the Accused did not give any evidence during the defence’s case, whether in the course of examination-in-chief, cross-examination or re-examination, of his use of the Vicks inhaler at the material time. This was despite the prosecution and the Court repeatedly confirming with him the ambit of his medicine defence in the course of his testimony. The Accused merely mentioned this during the prosecution’s case when cross-examining the HSA expert. In any event, Ms Bellene Chung had testified that Vicks inhaler containing the controlled drug levmetamfetamine (which may give rise to methamphetamine in the urine) would not be available over the counter in Singapore.

73     With regard to the Valium tablet and illicit cough mixture, it was pertinent to note that the Accused did not ask any questions of the HSA experts as to how the consumption of these substances could have caused his urine to be tested positive for methamphetamine. The Accused also did not give any evidence on how these substances could give rise to such a result. As such, any alleged connection between the Valium tablets and illicit cough mixture with methamphetamine in his urine would be pure speculation.

74     As for Robitussin, while the Accused may hold firm to his own belief that consumption of pseudoephedrine would give rise to methamphetamine in the urine, both Ms Bellene Chung and Ms Tan Joo Chin have emphatically testified to the contrary. In fact, Ms Bellene Chung took pains to explain that while pseudoephedrine might be used in the manufacturing process for methamphetamine, the manufacturing process and a human body metabolism process were different. I have no reason to doubt the evidence given by the two experts who were qualified to provide their opinions in this area of scientific, specialised knowledge. With respect, the Accused’s attempts to challenge the expert evidence, based on internet research material of unknown authorship and source[^1], as well as his purported personal knowledge, could not be given any weight.

75     At the end of the trial, I had no difficulty finding that the Accused had failed to rebut the presumption in section 22 of the MDA on a balance of probabilities. This was especially so since the Accused had clearly admitted in Exhibit P11 to consuming “Ice” (the street name for methamphetamine) on 5 August 2018 and provided many details regarding his drug consumption habits.

76     In conclusion, having carefully scrutinised the totality of the evidence, I was satisfied that the prosecution has proven the 3 proceeded charges against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt. As such I found the Accused guilty and convict him of the same.

77     As mentioned earlier in these grounds, the Accused had filed his appeal only against conviction. However, for completeness, I shall set out the details of the charge which the Accused pleaded guilty to, and the overall sentence imposed on him.

## PG CHARGE AND FACTS

78     The Accused pleaded guilty to and was convicted on the following charge:

> DAC-930769-2018

> You \[…\] are charged that you, on 6 August 2018, in Singapore, being a person subjected to a Supervision Order for a period of 24 months with effect from 16 December 2017, issued under Regulation 15(3)(f) of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (Rg 3, 1999 Rev Ed), did fail to present yourself for urine test to the Duty Officer at Bedok Division Headquarters as required under the said Order and you have thereby committed an offence under Regulation 15(3)(f) of the aforesaid Regulations and punishable under Regulation 15(6)(a) of the aforesaid Regulations;

> and further,

> that you, from 16 December 2017 to 13 August 2019, were subject to a remission order made by the Commissioner of Prisons under Division 2 or 3 of Part VB of the Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2014 Rev Ed) which remission order is subject to the basic condition under s 50S(1) of the Prisons Act, and while the remission order is in effect you, on **6 August 2018**, committed the aforesaid offence and upon conviction and the imposition of a sentence reflected under s 50S(1)(b) of the Prisons Act, shall be deemed to have breached the basic condition of your remission order, and you are thereby liable to be punished under s 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of **373 Days** from 6 August 2018 to 13 August 2019.

79     He admitted to the following facts without qualification:

> “The accused is Ayup Khan S/O M Kader Sultan, male / 46 years old (Date of Birth: 17 September 1973), Singaporean, bearing NRIC No. XXX.

> **2**.    On 7 August 2018 at about 11.42 am, the accused was arrested by officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“**CNB**”) Officers at No. 84 Lorong 6 Geylang, Singapore, for drug related offences. He was also found to be “wanted” _vide_ Police Gazette for failing to report for his urine testing since April 2018.

> **FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 6TH CHARGE (DAC 930769/2018)**

> **3**.    On 22 November 2017, the accused was placed under compulsory supervision for 24 months from 16 December 2017 to 15 December 2019, by virtue of Regulation 15 of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (Cap 185, Reg 3) (“**the Regulations**”).

> **4**.    Pursuant to Regulation 15(3)(f) of the Regulations, the accused is required to present himself at the Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters, on every Monday and Friday of each month from 9.30 am to 10.00 pm, commencing on 18 December 2017, for urine tests during the period that the accused was subjected to supervision, except on public holidays. However, the accused failed to report for his urine tests since 6 April 2018 without any valid reason.

> **5**.    In particular, the accused contravened the Regulations when he failed to present himself for the requisite urine test to the Duty Officer at the Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters on **6 August 2018 (Monday)**, without any valid reason.

> **6**.    The accused has thereby committed an offence under Regulation 15(3)(f), punishable under Regulation 15(6)(a) of the Regulations.

> **7**.    Further, the accused was, from 16 December 2017 to 13 August 2019, subjected to a remission order made by the Commissioner of Prisons under Division 2 of Part VB of the Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2014 Rev Ed) (“**Prisons Act**”) which remission order is subject to the basic condition under s 50S(1) of the Prisons Act. The accused thus committed the aforesaid offence on 6 August 2018 while such remission order was in effect.

> **8**.    Upon conviction and the imposition of sentences reflected under s 50S(1)(b) of the Prisons Act, the accused shall be deemed to have breached the basic condition of his remission order on the date of the commission of the aforesaid offence. The accused is thereby liable to be punished under s 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of **373 days**, from 6 August 2018 to 13 August 2019.”

## SENTENCE

80     Having carefully considered the Accused’s antecedents, the prosecution’s submissions on sentence and the Accused’s mitigation plea, I sentenced the Accused as follows:

81     I further ordered that the sentences in DAC-927797-2018, DAC-930766-2018 and DAC-930769-2018 to run consecutively,and the sentence in DAC-930765-2018 to run concurrently. I backdated the sentence to the Accused’s first date of remand, which was 15 August 2018.

82     As such, the Accused was sentence to a total of 240 days' imprisonment (enhanced sentence), and 7 years' and 13 months' imprisonment with effect from 15 August 2018, and 6 strokes of the cane.
