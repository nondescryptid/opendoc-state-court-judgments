### District Judge Dorothy F M Ling:

## Introduction[^1]

1       This was the plaintiff’s claim for damages against the defendant for defamation and malicious falsehood over a written complaint about the plaintiff that the defendant submitted to AIA Singapore Pte Ltd (“AIA”).

2       At the time of the complaint, the plaintiff was a Financial Services Associate Director (“FSAD”) with AIA, and the defendant was an AIA policyholder and customer.

3       I dismissed the plaintiff’s claim. He has appealed against my decision.

## The parties

### The plaintiff

4       Around April 2007, the plaintiff joined HSBC Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“HSBC”) as a financial planner. He did well and often won awards for his work performance. In 2010, the plaintiff became a Unit Manager and was in charge of a team of financial planners in HSBC.

5       It was around 2 November 2011 that the plaintiff became the defendant’s insurance agent when the defendant bought two insurance policies from HSBC.

6       However, in or around November 2013, HSBC “discontinued its agency distribution channel for insurance products”.[^2] Pursuant to an arrangement between HSBC and AIA for the latter to hire HSBC’s insurance agents, AIA offered the plaintiff a position as its FSAD. On or around 17 January 2014, the plaintiff formally accepted the offer and assumed the position. He remained in this position until he was no longer an AIA insurance agent.

### The defendant

7       The defendant was a Chinese citizen who had come to Singapore in 2009 to study at the National University of Singapore (“NUS”). Upon his graduation, he stayed on in Singapore to work.

8       He was a customer of both HSBC and AIA in that he purchased some insurance policies from both companies at different points in time. In purchasing the policies from HSBC, and later also from AIA, it was the plaintiff who represented HSBC and then AIA and who dealt with the defendant at the material points in time.

9       The defendant came to know the plaintiff through a mutual friend, one Yan Yanjun (“John Yan”) who was also a policyholder of HSBC insurance policies. John Yan also bought his HSBC insurance policies through the plaintiff.

## Facts of the Case

10     In or around November 2011, the defendant purchased two insurance policies from HSBC. The policies are:

> (a)     the Growth Manager Policy (No. 1125XXXX) (“GM Policy”); and

> (b)     the Life Manager Plus Policy (No. 1128XXXX) (“LMP Policy”).

The plaintiff represented HSBC in dealing with the defendant for these two policies.

11     After the plaintiff joined AIA, the defendant also bought a policy from AIA through the plaintiff, although the defendant claimed that at the time of the purchase, he was unaware that this was an AIA Policy. This policy was known as the Family First Secure Policy (“FFS Policy”). This happened around mid-August 2015. It is not disputed that around that same time, the defendant surrendered his LMP Policy. However, the circumstances surrounding the purchase of the FFS Policy and the surrendering of the LMP Policy were disputed.

12     This case arose from a letter of complaint about the plaintiff that the defendant sent to AIA around 5 October 2015 when the plaintiff was holding the position of FSAD at AIA. The plaintiff alleged that the words contained in the letter of complaint (“**the Words**”) were defamatory and/or false and published maliciously.

13     In order to appreciate the Words, it is necessary to set out the background of how the letter came to be. However, as the parties’ versions of what happened are at variance, it is necessary to give both versions of what might have transpired.

### The plaintiff’s version

14     When the plaintiff left HSBC and joined AIA, he was still allowed to service the customers who had bought HSBC insurance through him in respect of their HSBC policies, but only if the customers gave their written consent for him to do so. It is not disputed that the defendant did not give consent for the plaintiff to continue to act for him.

##### The FFS Policy

15     However, according to the plaintiff’s Statement of Claim (“SOC”), the defendant contacted the plaintiff on or about 8 August 2015 to meet up to review the defendant’s insurance policies. At that meeting, the plaintiff recommended the defendant the FFS Policy with its lower premium and no loading. It was the plaintiff’s case that he then assisted the defendant to fill up the application form for the FFS Policy[^3] and also explained the terms and conditions of the FFS Policy to the defendant. Thereupon, the defendant signed on every page of the application papers.[^4] It was the plaintiff’s understanding that the defendant paid the annual premium of S$1,620 to AIA for the FFS Policy on or about 15 August 2015 at a Self-Automated Machine (“SAM”).

##### The LMP Policy

16     Concerning the LMP Policy, the plaintiff states in his affidavit that on 9 August 2015, the defendant sought his advice on whether he should surrender the LMP Policy so as to be able to remit funds to his family in China.[^5] According to the plaintiff, he declined to advise the defendant on this as it related to an HSBC Policy which the plaintiff was then not authorised to handle for the defendant. The plaintiff nevertheless assisted the defendant to fill up the form for the surrender of the LMP Policy. It was on 16 August 2015 that the plaintiff learnt that the defendant had surrendered his LMP Policy.[^6]

17     On 19 August 2015, the plaintiff confirmed with the defendant that the defendant had received from HSBC the sum of S$1,945.58, being the surrender value for his LMP Policy. This amount included “an extra sum” of S$320.00. (Presumably, this S$320 was the difference between the surrender value of the LMP Policy at S$1,945.58 and the annual premium of the FFS Policy, at S$1,620.00.)

18     On 20 August 2015, the parties met up again on the plaintiff’s initiative. According to the plaintiff, this was “part of AIA’s standard “after-sales care” protocol”[^7]. The plaintiff deposed that at this meeting, he handed the defendant the documents related to the FFS Policy.

19     About 17 September 2015, according to the plaintiff, the defendant called him and updated that he had remitted money back to China. The defendant also expressed interest and enquired about a savings plan with AIA (“the AIA Savings Plan).[^8] The plaintiff therefore emailed the defendant the product brochure “which \[he\] thought might be suitable for \[the defendant\]”.[^9]

20     It was only around 28 September 2015 that the parties met up again – at the defendant’s request – to clarify about the surrender of the defendant’s LMP Policy as well as the purchase of the FFS Policy. This meeting took place inside the plaintiff’s car at the defendant’s workplace at NUS. According to the plaintiff, the meeting was about an hour.

21     At the said meeting at NUS, it was the plaintiff’s account of events that the defendant informed him that HSBC explained that this S$320 could be viewed as “a ‘bonus’”[^10] to encourage the defendant to “either sign up for other HSBC insurance policies or pay for the premium of his existing GMP Policy”.[^11] The plaintiff claimed to also have helped the defendant understand the differences between the LMP Policy and the FFS Policy and to also have impressed upon the defendant that he was no longer authorised to deal with the defendant’s HSBC policies.

22     It was also during this meeting at NUS that the parties had a heated argument. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant accused him of causing the defendant to surrender the LMP Policy. The argument ended when the defendant left the plaintiff’s car. However, the defendant returned two times: the first, to retrieve his LMP Policy documents which he had left inside the defendant’s car; and the second, to demand that the plaintiff compensate him S$4,000 which was the amount the defendant lost as a result of his surrendering his LMP Policy, which he attributed to the plaintiff. He also demanded that the plaintiff handed over his commission earned as a result of the defendant getting the FFS Policy.

23     These were the events – according to the plaintiff – that preceded the complaint letter to AIA, the words of which letter are the Words which are the subject of the present defamation suit.

### The defendant’s version

24     According to the defendant, on or about 12 August 2015, the plaintiff telephoned the defendant and informed that he was working for both HSBC and AIA. He understood from the plaintiff that HSBC was offering a 10% discount for its clients who had purchased the LMP Policy, and that would include the defendant. To take benefit of this, the defendant was told that he had to, _inter alia_, transfer an amount of S$1,620.00 into his ““_HSBC Insurance Account_””[^12] (emphasis in original) before his birthday on 19 August 2015. Upon doing that, the defendant could expect a sum of S$1,800.00. It was explained to the defendant that the difference of the two sums, at S$180.00, would be the 10% discount. When the defendant enquired why HSBC could not just send him a cheque of S$180.00, the plaintiff explained that “this was how the system worked”.[^13] The plaintiff also said that he would assist the defendant in doing up the necessary application forms and to transfer the S$1,620.00 into the said ‘HSBC Insurance Account’. According to the defendant, he was not sure what account this was, but “did not question \[the plaintiff\] on it as \[the defendant\] had trusted \[the plaintiff\] to manage \[his\] policies.”[^14]

25     Upon the defendant’s agreeing to this, the parties met up the next day on 13 August 2015 for the defendant to sign the necessary papers. As the defendant was in a rush, they had the meeting inside the plaintiff’s car. The defendant signed the papers which the plaintiff assured that he would fill them up for him later.[^15] The defendant deposed that since he trusted the plaintiff and was in a rush, he just quickly signed the papers and left.[^16]

26     According to the defendant, the payment of S$1,620.00 was made on 15 August 2015 at a Self-Automated Machine (“SAM”) at the Post Office at Ghim Moh Road. This fact is congruent with the plaintiff. It was also the Defendant’s case that the plaintiff was the one who typed in the account number, showed the defendant that it was the defendant’s name and then instructed on the transfer of the funds. Unknown to the defendant at that time, the “HSBC Insurance account” was actually the “AIA Insurance Account”.

27     On 19 August 2015, upon the plaintiff’s asking, the defendant updated that he has received the funds and that the amount was not S$1,800.00 but S$1,945.58. When they next met up on 20 August 2015, the plaintiff shared with the defendant about the AIA Savings Plan. The plaintiff also informed the defendant that the excess amount of S$325.58 (that is, the difference between S$1,945.58 and S$1,620.00) was a ‘bonus’ by HSBC to encourage its customers to take up the AIA Savings Plan, otherwise the amount would need to be returned to HSBC. However, the defendant was not interested in the AIA Savings Plan as it called for a 10-year commitment which the defendant had considered too long.

28     According to the defendant, it was only towards the end of August 2015 when the defendant received the contract related to the FFS Policy did he realise that he had bought the FFS Policy. He also discovered that the policy commenced on 19 August 2015, and that its annual premium was S$1,620.00. When the defendant had the chance to check with the plaintiff on this sometime in early September 2015, the defendant stated, “He also convinced me that this policy had more benefits and cost less than the previous LMP Policy. I did not feel a need to question him further as I had my full trust in him.”[^17]

29     On that day in early September 2015, the plaintiff again tried to sell the defendant the AIA Savings Plan. The defendant wanted to consider this and so asked for more information. This was emailed to him on 17 September 2015.[^18] However, by 25 September 2015, the defendant had decided that he was not interested in the AIA Savings Plan. The plaintiff therefore reminded him to return the S$325.58. The defendant then “decided to take another look at the AIA Savings Plan and the FFS Contract”.[^19]

30     On 27 September 2015, when the defendant took that second look at the AIA Savings Plan and the FFS Policy, he noticed that the latter did not mention the transfer from HSBC of any policy. It also did not mention about any 10% discount. According to the defendant, this was the first time that he “felt suspicious and realised that something might be wrong.”[^20] He then called the plaintiff immediately.

31     Upon checking with the plaintiff, the defendant learnt that his “LMP Policy was surrendered and transferred to AIA, and all the premiums paid in the previous LMP Policy became the first-year premium of the FFS Policy due to the transfer process”.[^21] This was a loss to him as the premiums he had paid for the LMP Policy amounted to about S$6,750.00 whilst the annual premium for the FFS Policy was only S$1,620.00. The defendant became “very angry”.[^22] According to the defendant, that was the first time he became aware that his LMP Policy had been surrendered. He then informed the plaintiff that he did not want to sign up for the AIA Savings Plan and the parties arranged to meet up the next day for the defendant to consequently return the S$325.58.

32     On 28 September 2015 morning, upon calling HSBC and making enquiries, the defendant learnt from an HSBC Customer Service Officer that he – the defendant himself – had surrendered the LMP Policy. The S$1,945.38 that he had received was the LMP Policy’s surrender value. He also confirmed through that call that there was neither an insurance policy transfer between HSBC and AIA nor a 10% discount for a policy. The defendant deposed:[^23]

> … he had cheated me into obtaining my authorisation to surrender my HSBC insurance and sign a new AIA policy, and the transfer of S$1,620.00 via the SAM was to a new AIA account for the new AIA policy. The S$1,945.58 received was the cash I would receive upon surrendering the HSBC policy.

33     Knowing that his friend, John Yan, also bought the LMP Policy from the plaintiff, the defendant checked with John Yan and found out that the plaintiff had also made John Yan surrender his LMP Policy for an FFS Policy.

34     When the defendant realised that he was not the only “victim”,[^24] he decided to “collect evidence of \[the plaintiff’s\] cheating”.[^25] So, for his next meeting with the plaintiff on 28 September 2015, the defendant decided to record their conversation.[^26] As his mobile phone’s microphone was not working well, he borrowed his laboratory mate’s mobile phone. This laboratory mate was one Jin Hui Ning. (“Hui Ning”).

35     On 28 September 2015, the plaintiff and the defendant only managed to meet up at about 4.30pm as the plaintiff was late. According to the defendant, the meeting was for about 37 minutes. At the end of the meeting, the defendant returned to his laboratory, and, using Hui Ning’s email account, sent an email to himself attaching the recording.[^27] He then returned the mobile phone to Hui Ning. The recording was subsequently also forwarded to John Yan as the defendant wanted to find out if the plaintiff told John Yan the same things.

36     After some discussion with John Yan on 28 and/or 29 September 2015, the defendant spoke again with HSBC and re-confirmed that the plaintiff had indeed lied to them and that there was no such promotion to encourage customers to buy a new AIA policy. This was reconfirmed when the defendant also received a call from an HSBC officer who expressed that his case was “very rare and that they were taking it very seriously”.[^28]

37     Over the next few days, the defendant and John Yan wrote complaint letters to HSBC and AIA.[^29] John Yan also forwarded to AIA the recording _via_ email.[^30]

38     The complaint letter to AIA by the defendant on 5 October 2015 was the subject of this defamation suit.

### The alleged defamatory words

39     The defendant was given to understood that the words alleged by the plaintiff to be defamatory were as follows:[^31]

> (a)     “Between August and September 2015, \[the Plaintiff\] cheated me to surrender the \[LMP Policy\] and to buy a new AIA insurance policy called \[the FFS Policy\]”;

> (b)     “Around 12th August 2015, \[the Plaintiff\] contacted me saying that he was working for both AIA and HSBC and still serving me as an advisor”;

> (c)     “\[The Plaintiff\] told me that HSBC was offering 10% discount for \[LMP Policy\] clients. He said that I only need to transfer \[S$1,620\] to my HSBC insurance account and would receive around \[S$1,800\] within a few days. The \[S$180\] difference is the discount”;

> (d)     “\[The Plaintiff\] told me not to worry about these forms as he would fill them up for me. I trusted him and signed all the forms”;

> (e)     “I questioned \[the Plaintiff\] why I got a new \[FFS Policy\] from AIA. He replied me saying that it was just a transfer process since all the policy and agents from HSBC have been brought by AIA”;

> (f)     “\[The Plaintiff\] told me that my LMP policy has been surrendered and I was transferred to the AIA insurance. He also mentioned that this transfer process was according to the agreement between AIA and HSBC, therefore he was not responsible for any loss”;

> (g)     “Suddenly I realised that the whole 10% discount story was a lie. What actually happened was: He cheated me to sign the form, obtaining my authorisation to surrender my \[LMP Policy\] and sign a new AIA insurance policy →he let me to transfer \[S$1,620\] to open a new AIA account →I received \[S$1,945.58\] cash back from HSBC insurance”;

> (h)     “On 29th September, I called the HSBC customer services again and confirmed that \[the Plaintiff\] totally cheated us” and

> (i)     “I cannot believe that your employee did such despicable thing to us. It is full of lies from the beginning to the end. \[The Plaintiff’s\] act not only caused a big loss for his clients (I don’t think I’m the only clients \[_sic_\] who was cheated by him), but also caused a big damage to your insurance’s reputation.”

(To be referred to collectively as “the Words”.)

40     The plaintiff alleged that the Words “carry defamatory meaning”[^32] and that, “in their natural and ordinary meaning, the Words meant and/or were understood to mean:-[^33]

> (a)     The Plaintiff was incompetent in his work and/or business and/or trade;

> (b)     The plaintiff had committed fraud in carrying out transactions on behalf of the Defendant when he was not authorised to do so;

> (c)     The Plaintiff had cheated the Defendant into surrendering his LMP Policy and purchasing his FFS Policy; and

> (d)     The Plaintiff was dishonest and untruthful in making certain representations to the Defendant, presumably for personal gain.

## Issues to be determined

41     It was not in dispute in the present case that the Words referred to the plaintiff and that they were published to third persons, and in this case, that would be the body corporate, AIA.

42     The primary issue that this Court had to determine was whether the Words were defamatory in nature.

43     The onus of showing that the Words were defamatory in nature was on the Plaintiff. In the event that the Plaintiff succeeds in discharging this burden of proof, the Court would go on to examine whether the plaintiff’s claim was defeated by the defendant’s two-pronged defences of justification and qualified privilege which he had pleaded in his Defence. It must be borne in mind that the defence of qualified privilege could be defeated if the plaintiff was able to show that there was malice on the defendant’s part.

44     This tied in with the plaintiff’s suit against the defendant under the tort of malicious falsehood. It therefore followed that if the plaintiff failed to prove malice on the defendant’s part, the defence of qualified privilege would succeed, and the plaintiff would also not have proven his case for malicious falsehood.

45     So, in order for the plaintiff to succeed in this claim, the Court was mindful that the plaintiff must successfully cross _all_ the following hurdles:

> (a)     establish that the Words were defamatory in nature;

> (b)     for the defendant to have failed in his defences of justification and qualified privilege;

> (c)     or, if the defendant should win in his defence of qualified privilege, to show that there was malice as the presence of malice would defeat the defence of qualified privilege.

46     Further, if the plaintiff succeeded in defeating the defendant’s defence of qualified privilege by showing that there _was_ malice, to succeed under the tort of malicious falsehood – as the phrase suggests – the plaintiff must prove that there was malice as well as falsity in the Words. To be able to claim special damages under this head of claim, the plaintiff must also show the causal nexus between the Words and the plaintiff’s loss or damage.

## Issue 1: Whether the Words were defamatory

### The plaintiff’s position

47     The plaintiff had suggested that the Words, in their natural and ordinary meaning meant that –

> (a)     the plaintiff was incompetent in his work and/or profession and/or business and/or trade;

> (b)     the Plaintiff had committed fraud in carrying out transactions on behalf of the defendant when he was not authorised to do so;

> (c)     the Plaintiff had cheated the Defendant into surrendering his LMP Policy and purchasing the FFS Policy; and

> (d)     the Plaintiff was dishonest and untruthful in making certain representations to the Defendant, presumably for personal gain.

### The defendant’s position

48     The defendant’s counsel submitted that the Words did not carry defamatory imputation and “the ordinary reasonable person reading the said words would understand them to be simply describing the Defendant’s allegation that the Plaintiff had misled him into surrendering the LMP Policy and purchasing the FFS policy”.[^34]

### The decision on Issue 1

49     To found a case on defamation, the onus was on the plaintiff to establish the following:

> (a)     that the Words were “defamatory” in nature;

> (b)     that the Words referred to the plaintiff; and

> (c)     that the Words had been published.

50     I had found no issue with the latter two conditions in the present case; they had clearly been satisfied. The issue was whether the Words were defamatory in nature. This has to be ascertained objectively; the test is one of the “ordinary reasonable person who is not unduly suspicious or avid for scandal”: _Jeyaratnam Joshua Benjamin v Goh Chok Tong_ \[1983-84\] SLR(R) 745. Neither is this person unduly naïve.

51     The Words would be defamatory if they _tend to_ –

> (a)     lower the plaintiff in the estimation of right-thinking members of society (or ordinary reasonable persons) generally;

> (b)     cause the plaintiff to be shunned or avoided; or

> (c)     expose the plaintiff to hatred, contempt or ridicule.

(See: Gary Chan Kok Yew & Lee Pey Woan, _The Law of Torts in Singapore_ (Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2016) at para 12.015.) I accepted that the plaintiff only needed to show that there is a likelihood of the above happening, and not necessarily that they actually happened as a result thereof.

52     It is not disputed that the Words were contained in a complaint letter to AIA. I am guided by the cases of _Chan Cheng Wah Bernard v Koh Sin Chong Freddie_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGCA 63</span> (“_Bernard Chan_’s case”) and the English case of _Stocker v Stocker_ \[2019\]8 UKSC 17, that it is pertinent to consider the context within which the alleged defamatory words might be received. This is particularly since there must be the possibility that _this_ “ordinary reasonable person” will believe the Words, otherwise it cannot lower the plaintiff’s reputation: _WIC Radio Ltd v Simpson_ \[2008\] 2 SCR 420 at \[97\].

53     In the present case, the Words were set in the context of a complaint letter to AIA. In fact, reading the letter, it mostly only recounted what had allegedly happened. One could sense the defendant’s indignation from the letter, which was sufficient for AIA to take steps to investigate into it.

54     As such, the “ordinary reasonable person” in the present case must be the class of persons or person who receives and reads such complaint letters in the course of a day’s work, and is likely tasked with dealing with customer complaints. This court therefore asked itself whether such a class of persons or person would believe the Words at their face value, or, as a result of the Words, lower the plaintiff in their estimation. If they would not, then, the plaintiff’s reputation could not be lowered as a result of the Words.

55     In the present case, it is not disputed that upon receiving the complaint letter from the defendant and John Yan, a staff of AIA wrote to John Yan to request for the complete recording. It was also not disputed that AIA did its own investigation into the allegation or complaint (it called the plaintiff down to be interviewed, took statements from the plaintiff, engaged its own expert to investigate the allegation of tampering of the recording) and arrived at its own finding. Quite obviously therefore, AIA had suspended any judgment on its part about the plaintiff until it had carried out its investigation. Under such circumstance, using the objective test and applying it in its rightful context, I considered that the Words could not cause the plaintiff’s reputation to be tarnished or lowered in the estimation of the right-thinking readers. Besides, as I had opined earlier, the Words mainly recounted to the reader the events that brought about the letter.

56     I therefore held that the plaintiff had failed to persuade this court, on a balance of probabilities, that the Words were defamatory in nature.

57     The above finding was sufficient to dispose of the matter. However, I decided to go on to examine a situation _if_ the Words were considered to have been defamatory. In that circumstance, the defendant would have to be able to establish his defences of justification and qualified privilege.

## Issue 2: Whether the defence of justification was established

58     For the defence of justification, the onus would be on the defendant to prove that the words complained of are substantially true, since the law presumes that a defamatory statement is false. In dealing with this issue therefore, we are assuming that the Words were found to be defamatory.

59     In assuming that the Words were defamatory, for the defendant to succeed in his defence of justification, it was incumbent upon him to prove the truths of the Words. However, he would not be required to prove every detail of the offending statements:

> …it is sufficient if the substance of the libellous statement be justified… As much must be justified as meets the sting of the charge, and if anything be contained in a charge which does not add to the sting of it, that need not be justified.

(See: _Bernard Chan_’s case, at \[44\].)

### The recording of 28 September 2015

60     Considering the Words, and reading the transcript of the recording of the exchange between the plaintiff and the defendant when they met up on 28 September 2015,[^35] it was my personal observation that the truths of the Words were very much borne out in the exchange between the plaintiff and the defendant.

61     To illustrate the point above, in his complaint letter to AIA, the defendant had said that the plaintiff “cheated” him into surrendering his LMP Policy and to acquire the FFS Policy. In contrast, the plaintiff’s evidence was that on or about 12 Aug 2015, the defendant raised to the plaintiff that he was still undecided whether to surrender his LMP Policy.[^36] However, on 16 Aug 2015, the defendant updated the plaintiff that he had surrendered his policy and even asked when he could expect to receive the surrender value.[^37] Then, on 28 September 2015 when the plaintiff and defendant met up and the defendant enquired about the surrendering of his LMP Policy, it would be reasonable to think that if the situation had transpired such as what the plaintiff had deposed, it would have been easily defensible for the plaintiff to retort and remind the defendant that he had surrendered the LMP Policy.

62     Further, if the plaintiff had assisted the defendant to fill in the relevant forms like the plaintiff said he did, surely it would have been natural for the defendant to also make reference to that? However, throughout the exchange, nothing of those were mentioned. Instead, the plaintiff’s refrain was that the policy had “discontinued”, “no longer active”, “no longer available”, “no longer exist”:[^38]

So what about my \[LMP\] \[P\]olicy? It has a term right? 99 years.

 |
|

If this one continues, later I will show you that your coverage \[i.e., the FFS Policy\] is better…

But I still don’t understand, I thought my policy is under HSBC.

Because this portion of the business has already been taken over.

| 

D (00:04:33)

Taken over, so does that mean you want me to terminate my policy?

 |
| 

P (00:04:40)

 | 

Your policy is no longer active, we do not have this plan anymore, it has already been discontinued.

 |
|

When was it discontinued?

Before your birthday…

I still don’t quite understand.

P (00:05:14)

 | 

Which means the Life manage (_sic_) plus \[(LMP)\] has been stopped.

 |
| 

D (00:05:21)

 | 

When has it been stopped? Is it according to my birthday or?

 |
| 

P (00:05:25)

 | 

The start of your new plan, which is your birthday. You see your new plan is on 18 August.

 |
| 

D (00:05:32)

 | 

Right, so my previous HSBC plan, when does it stop? Do I have to give instruction to stop the plan?

 |
| 

P (00:05:40)

 | 

Right, I have mentioned it before when we met, before your birthday?

 |

This plan has been discontinued.

D (00:16:21)

 | 

Product no longer available, so the ones sold previously…

 |

Which is why we will have to do a transfer now.

 |
| 

D (00:16:28)

 | 

What if I choose not to transfer, what are the consequences?

 |
| 

P (00:16:32)

 | 

You can, but eventually when their \[(HSBC)\] insurance business no longer exist, it will automatically be terminated.

D (00:17:17)

 | 

Doesn’t continue?

D (00:17:22)

 | 

When you say “in the end”, how many years are we talking about?

 |
| 

P (00:17:24)

 | 

I am not sure. It could be this year end, or early next year.

63     Considering the subject of the exchange, would not “surrender” be the easier and more accurate word to use, given that that was what the plaintiff deposed had happened? However, it appeared that “surrender” was a taboo word to be avoided. It would therefore not be unreasonable for the Court to surmise that what the plaintiff deposed did not happen. The defendant was indeed misled into surrendering his LMP Policy. The Court was apprised that following AIA’s investigation, the defendant was allowed to have his LMP Policy reinstated with HSBC, and which policy continued.

64     For the more specific proofs of ‘the truths’, the defendant’s counsel had, in his submissions, highlighted in greater details the salient portions of the transcript which corroborated with the defendant’s evidence.[^39] There is no need to reproduce them here.

65     Quite clearly, the recording of 28 September 2015 would establish for the defendant his defence of justification and is damaging to the plaintiff’s case. It is also noteworthy that the plaintiff did not challenge that the recording bore out the contents of the complaint letter – the Words – and corroborated the defendant’s evidence. The defence of justification would be established by the recording.

66     It would be this reason that the plaintiff strenuously challenged the authenticity of the recording. It was therefore necessary for the Court to, at this point, examine the integrity or veracity of the recording. In the event that the Court accepted that the recording was tampered with in such a way as to distort the truth, this evidence of the 28 September 2015 recording must be set aside and not be relied on.

### Whether the recording was reliable

67     In questioning the integrity of the recording, the plaintiff had called upon four expert witnesses whilst the defendant one expert witness. The plaintiff’s four expert witnesses were to show that the recording was tampered with. The defendant’s sole expert witness, however, was not present to prove that the recording was not tampered with, but to show that circumstantially, it was not possible for any tampering to be done.

68     While I respected the expertise of the expert witnesses, I have to admit that I was unable to accept their expert opinion that the recording had been tampered with. Let me explain.

69     On 28 September 2015, the meeting between the plaintiff and defendant was to be at 4.30pm. The fact of the matter was that the plaintiff was late, A text message at 4:44pm was sent where the parties informed each other that they had arrived. So, it would be a few more minutes before they actually met up. But we can take it that they met up at 4:44pm. The recording that was surrendered played for 37 minutes. Calculating this from 4:44pm – which would be the best case scenario for the Plaintiff, add the 37 minutes and it would bring us to 5:21pm.

70     When the defendant returned from the meeting, he emailed himself the recording. The email shows the timestamp for when the defendant sent the audio to himself. It was 5:27pm. Time has to be accounted for for the defendant to return to his workstation as well. Given this flow of events, it had troubled me that if there should be any tampering done, where was that window of time when the tampering could possibly be done?

71     It was the defendant’s expert witness’ evidence (Mr Tan Kah Leong) that the recording that was attached to the 5.27pm email was the same recording that was subsequently forwarded to AIA. If there was any tampering done it would have to be done before it was uploaded onto the 5:27pm email. Even if, as alleged, that John Yan had the expertise, just where was that window of time when the act of tampering could be done?

72     Mr Tan Kah Leong’s evidence was also that after the recording was first uploaded onto the email, there was no tampering of the email or its attachment.[^40] Mr Tan’s response when re-examined is captured below:[^41]

> Q    …You have analysed it. Is there no possibility that after that date, somebody went to tamper with the attachment which is the sound recording and change it to something?

> A    There’s no possibility that you can tamper after receiving and cannot be detected. Once you tamper with it, the email header, that portion, will be zero out. The transmission path all will be zero out.

73     The plaintiff’s evidence was that the tampering was rather extensive. So, presumably, it would require quite a bit of time for the tampering to be performed, even if it was a hurried job. I must admit that it got me excited when the plaintiff’s expert, Mr Lu Gang, testified in court that the tampering could be done simply and would take “less than a minute. Maybe 1 second will be sufficient.”[^42] He even said that “\[e\]veryone can do that, not only me.”[^43] I was incredulous at this evidence, but was very open and ready to embrace this evidence as what might possibly have happened. However, when Mr Lu Gang was invited and even urged to demonstrate this for the benefit of the court, and to prove his point, he did not execute it, but suggested a method of doing it which appeared to me most amateurish a method since it was so basic and could be too easily discovered: by simply pressing the pause button at certain junctures. This suggested that the defendant would know when these junctures would be? What a preposterous suggestion, if so.

74     So, whilst the experts would have their reports stating that the recording had been tampered with, the circumstances of the case was that this was impossible in terms of time. Besides, I should think that if there was any tampering done, the one who tampers with it would take all pains to erase the flaws and do a perfect recording before the same is submitted as evidence of any sort.

75     Further, I am cognisant of the fact that at the end of the day, with all due respect to the experts, they were really mostly dependent on their personal critical hearings to decipher the alleged flaws of any recording. However, perhaps authentic recording are with flaws and tampered recording would be flawless as pains would have been taken to ensure the tampering would not be detected and so, they would have been cosmeticized over? Also, the portions of the recording that were alleged by the plaintiff’s witnesses to have been tampered with were, in my opinion, generally unimportant portions of the conversation. Also, the plaintiff’s experts were incongruent in their opinions on the portions of the recording which they alleged had been tampered with.

76     I must add a comment about the reports of the plaintiff’s expert witnesses, Mr Billy Leong and Mr Lee Leng Kok. I had grave doubts about the veracity of their reports given that there were similar portions in their reports, and they had refused to reveal the author of their reports. It is gravely suspected that the author of both reports was one and the same and possibly of the two experts. I therefore accord it the appropriate weight.

77     All things put together and considered, whilst the plaintiff’s experts have opined that the recordings have been tampered with, I am not persuaded. Contrarily, on a balance of probabilities, I am preferring the defendant’s expert who opined on the more practical aspect of this evidence, that the recording as attached in the email and the recording that was ultimately forwarded to AIA for investigation are the same.

78     Consequent upon my finding on the issue of the credibility and reliability of the 28 September recording, on a balance of probabilities, the contents of the recording are what transpired at the 28 September 2015 4.30pm meeting.

79     Of course, the defendant had also submitted other evidence such as the plaintiff’s statement to AIA during the query.

80     On the defendant’s defence of justification therefore, I must rule that the defendant has established his defence of justification.

## Issue 3: The defence of qualified privilege

81     The defendant had also pleaded the defence of qualified privilege. Given that I had ruled that the defendant had succeeded in his defence of justification, even if the Words were found defamatory, and even if the defence of qualified privilege fails, the defence of justification having been established would have allowed this Court to dismiss the plaintiff’s claim of defamation.

82     There is therefore no need to state more than what I stated in my oral judgment, that I considered the defendant’s communication or complaint raised to AIA to indeed be an occasion of qualified privilege. It was the plaintiff’s evidence that when he realised what had happened with his LMP Policy, he at once checked with John Yan as he remembered that John Yan had bought similar policies.[^44] Upon learning what had also happened to John Yan, the defendant “was also angry as \[he\] realised \[he\] was not the only victim and there might be more cases \[he\] did not know of”.[^45]

### Was there malice?

83     The burden then shifted back to the plaintiff to show that this defence of qualified privilege was to be defeated by malice. Naturally, it must be the plaintiff who bore the burden to prove malice.

84     As plaintiff’s counsel rightly pointed out, malice could be proven by showing:[^46]

> (a)     “\[T\]hat the defendant knew the Words were false or was reckless as to its truth or did not believe in its truth; and

> (b)     \[E\]ven if the Defendant had a genuine or honest belief in the truth of the defamatory statement, by showing that his dominant motive was to injure the plaintiff or was otherwise improper”.

(See: _Bernard Chan_’s case, at \[90\].)

85     The plaintiff submitted that the defendant ought to know what he was signing when they met up (the date of the meeting in dispute).[^47] The documents even had AIA’s letterhead and logo. Amongst these documents was the HSBC Surrender Form. It was, however, the defendant’s testimony that the plaintiff had merely indicated by way of sticker where he should sign on different documents, and the plaintiff would just flip the pages to the relevant page of the document.[^48] The plaintiff’s counsel submits that “\[f\]rom a reasonable person’s objective point of view, \[this\] is unbelievable or inconceivable”.[^49]

86     I held a different view from the plaintiff’s counsel. The defendant had admitted that the plaintiff was his “close friend”.[^50] The closeness of their relationship was evident even from the recording of 28 September 2015. In the said recording, on a few occasions, the plaintiff had referred to his treating the defendant as a friend. The plaintiff became upset and indignant when the defendant queried about the reason on a previous occasion when the plaintiff took the defendant’s bank statements. The plaintiff explained that it was to verify the defendant’s address with AIA but also brought in trust issues between the two of them. It can be presumed by this reference that there was trust between them. At one point in the conversation, the plaintiff even said to the defendant (at 00:30:39):[^51]

> I regard you as my brother, let me tell you, if I want to make money, there are many other ways. I won’t seek to profit from you or anything.

There were even references by the plaintiff to the defendant, using the defendant’s pet name, “Xiaobai”.

87     That the plaintiff should be upset by the defendant’s query on the bank statement suggested to me that their previous interaction might have been that the defendant had waveringly and unquestioningly accepted all that the plaintiff informed or advised him. Raising the query of why the plaintiff should have the defendant’s bank statement was unprecedented. It would therefore be very credible that the same type of interaction happened between the parties on that occasion, where the plaintiff directed the defendant where he should sign and the latter did so.

88     Further, as earlier mentioned, since the plaintiff stated that the defendant signed the HSBC Surrender Form before him, there was every reason for the plaintiff to mention this and jolt the defendant’s memory about it, particularly since this was a happening that the defendant ought to have known. But, it appeared to me from the 28 September 2015 recording that the plaintiff took care to avoid making it explicit how the LMP Policy came to be surrendered.

89     I therefore found it very plausible that the defendant would indeed sign the documents without reading them through, wholly accepting what the plaintiff told him.

90     The Court was therefore not persuaded, on a balance of probabilities, that the defendant “knew the Words were false or was reckless as to its truth or did not believe in its truth”. There was also no evidence before me that the defendant’s dominant motivation in sending the complaint letter to AIA was “to injure the plaintiff or was… improper”. The invariable finding, flowing from the above, was that there was an absence of malice on the defendant’s part.

91     As plaintiff’s counsel rightly pointed out, the burden to show the existence of malice to defeat the defence of qualified privilege rested on the plaintiff. The plaintiff had failed to discharge that burden of proof.

### The claim under malicious falsehood

92     For the plaintiff’s claim under malicious falsehood, I would add that even if I had found malice, I was not persuaded that the loss occasioned by AIA’s terminating the plaintiff’s agency could be attributed to the defendant’s complaint letter. That would even be too flattering to the defendant that he should have such clout. From the string of events, it appeared to me that the plaintiff’s services being terminated by AIA was as a result of AIA’s own investigation albeit triggered by the complaint letter. Ultimately, AIA made their own finding, and took the necessary action. The plaintiff’s services were terminated by AIA.

93     So, even if the words were found to be defamatory, even if the defence of justification fails, even if there was malice or malicious falsehood, the award of special damages would not naturally follow. It would still be subject to strict proof.

94     Given the above findings. The plaintiff’s claim for damages and/or libel and/or malicious falsehood to be assessed must fail. The plaintiff’s case was dismissed.

## Costs

95     Following cost arguments which both Counsel submitted, cost was awarded to the defendant, fixed at S$42,000 (all in) plus GST.
