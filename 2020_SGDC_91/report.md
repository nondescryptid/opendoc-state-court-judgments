9 April 2020

### District Judge Clement Julien Tan Tze Ming:

1       The Accused was a registered estate agent. Between 2017 and 2019, the Accused leased six residential properties in the Geylang district for the purposes of providing short-term accommodation (“STA”). The Accused misrepresented to the owners that the properties were either for his own stay or to be used for his coffee business. The unsuspecting owners had no reason to believe that the Accused harboured a different agenda. Had they known, they would not have leased their properties to the Accused.

2       The scheme was a one-man operation. The Accused leased some properties in his name and others, through The Coffee Cart (“TCC”), his sole proprietorship. The Accused advertised the six properties on Airbnb, an online platform that lets people rent out their properties or spare rooms to guests. The Accused communicated directly with his guests – giving them instructions on check in and check out procedures, addressing their queries and personally meeting them at the various properties. The Accused also engaged a housekeeper for the properties. The rent payments were made to the Accused’s bank account.

3       The Accused’s scheme eventually unravelled in September 2018. Following investigations by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (“URA”), six charges were preferred against him, each for the offence under Section 12(1) of the Planning Act (Cap. 232). The 1st charge read as follows:-

> You … are charged that you, from on or about 15 March 2018 to 8 September 2018, did carry out development of the premises known as 5 Lorong 39 Geylang #04-04, Singapore 387866 (the “Premises”), which is outside a conservation area, without the planning permission of the Competent Authority, contrary to Section 12(1) of the Planning Act (Cap 232); to wit, by using the Premises which is a dwelling-house to provide short-term accommodation, where the Premises was occupied by the same person(s) for a period of less than 3 consecutive months in return for the payment of rent, which use constitutes development under Section3(3)(ca) of the said Act, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 12(4) of the Planning Act (Cap 232).

4       The remaining charges were similarly worded, differing only in the period of offending and the address of the premises. For completeness, the period of offending and the address of the premises for each of the six charges are set out in the table below:-

5       The Accused pleaded guilty to the first, second, fourth and sixth charges. He consented to the third and fifth charges being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. In sentencing, I imposed a fine of S$20,000 (carrying a default imprisonment term of four (4) weeks) for each of the first and second charges and a fine of S$24,000 (with a default imprisonment term of five (5) weeks) for each of the fourth and sixth charges. The aggregate fine imposed on the Accused was S$88,000 (with a default imprisonment term of eighteen (18) weeks). Dissatisfied, the prosecution lodged an appeal against the sentence imposed. The reasons for imposing the sentences I did are set out hereinafter.

## The applicable law

6       Section 12(1) of the Planning Act provides as follows:-

> A person must not, without planning permission, carry out or permit the carrying out of any development of any land outside a conservation area.

7       Following the legislative amendments introduced in 2017, the provision of STA for durations less than three (3) months was outlawed. In this regard, Section 3(ca) of the Planning Act defined “development” to include:-

> (ca)  the use for a purpose specified in the Fourth Schedule of a building or part of a building originally constructed as a dwelling-house constitutes development, whether such use commenced before, on or after the date of commencement of section 3(a) of the Planning (Amendment) Act 2017.

8       The Fourth Schedule to the Planning Act, in turn, provided as follows:-

> 1.    Use of a dwelling-house to provide dormitory accommodation.

> 2.    Use of a dwelling-house to provide short-term accommodation, where the dwelling-house or any part of it is occupied by the same person for a period of less than 3 consecutive months and the short-term accommodation is provided (with or without other services) in return for the payment of rent or other form of consideration, whether or not the relationship of landlord and tenant is thereby created.

9       The punishment for a person convicted of an offence under Section 12(1) of the Planning for the first time is a fine not exceeding S$200,000: Section 12(4)(a) of the Planning Act. Repeat offenders face a fine of up to S$200,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both: Section 12(4)(b) of the Planning Act. In the present case, Section 12(4)(a) of the Planning Act applied as this was the Accused’s first conviction.

## Parties’ submissions

10     The prosecution and the defence were at variance as to the appropriate sentencing approach to be adopted in respect of STA cases prosecuted under Section 12(1) of the Planning Act. There were, hitherto, no reported decisions in this regard.

11     The prosecution submitted that the fine to be imposed should comprise two components, _viz_., a punitive component and a disgorgement of profits component. For convenience, I will refer to this approach as the “Bifurcated Approach”. As regards the punitive component, the prosecution contended that fines of at least S$25,000 should be imposed for each of the 1st and 2nd charges, and at least S$35,000 for each of the 4th and 6th charges. As for the disgorgement component, it was undisputed that the Accused received the sum of S$115,112.13 over the period of offending. The prosecution submitted that this amount should be disgorged to strip away all ill-gotten gains from the Accused. The prosecution was therefore seeking an aggregate fine of at least S$235,000 to be imposed on the Accused in respect of the four proceeded charges.

12     I found that the Bifurcated Approach lacked juridical basis and accordingly, rejected the same.

13     It is an established sentencing principle that a fine may be imposed _in addition_ to a term of imprisonment to disgorge any ill-gotten gains from the offender (_Koh Jaw Hung v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 516</span> (“_Koh Jaw Hung_”) at \[44\]; _Poh Boon Kiat v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 892</span> (“_Poh Boon Kiat_”) at \[77\] – \[78\]). In _Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts_ Volume 1 (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed., 2013) at page 49, it is also stated that:-

> A fine may be combined with a term of imprisonment, where the maximum term of imprisonment is considered to be inadequate, or where it is used as a means of removing the offender’s profit from his offending: see _Garner_ (1987) 7 Cr App R(S) 285.

14     The prosecution’s position was that this principle could be extended to cases where only a fine is imposed. The prosecution thus cited _Koh Jaw Hung_ as authority for the Bifurcated Approach. However, I found the principle of disgorging profits by way of a fine _in addition_ to a term of imprisonment to be of no relevance to the present case, which involved the imposition of only a fine. There can be no doubt that the underlying sentencing considerations in both situations are vastly different. In cases where a term of imprisonment is imposed and the offender had profited from the crime, barring any disposal or confiscation order or restitution made by the offender, the only way to disgorge such unlawful profits would be through the imposition of a fine. The fine imposed in such cases would only serve the disgorgement objective. In contrast, in cases where only a fine is imposed, the fine would appear to serve a dual function of deterring and/or punishing and, _at the same time_, disgorging any ill-gotten gains.

15     The prosecution further submitted that the Bifurcated Approach, _albeit_ unarticulated, could be distilled as the underlying thread in a line of authorities involving Section 12 of the Planning Act. I disagreed.

16     In _Public Prosecutor v Project Lifestyle Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 251</span> (“_Project Lifestyle_”), the offence involved a material change of use of the premises from a restaurant to a bar without conservation permission. In the lower court, the prosecution submitted that a high fine should be imposed to disgorge the defendant’s profits. However, the District Judge rejected this submission because there was no “_evidence or information_”[^1] that the defendant had made any profits, and that the principle of disgorging profits from an offender was not relevant or applicable to offences concerning conservation of land. The High Court judge disagreed and at \[12\] of _Project Lifestyle_, held that:-

> “The District Judge also took the view that there was no evidence of any profits that needed to be disgorged and thus did not factor this aspect into consideration. It is true that no evidence was adduced in support of the prosecution’s argument to disgorge profits. It would be necessary in my view to consider the strong likelihood that profits must have been obtained as a result of the Respondent’s breach, by changing the business model to a bar and focusing on the sale of alcoholic drinks rather than food. But for the lure of prospective (and in all likelihood, actual) profits, it would be hard to see why the Respondent would have chosen to continue acting in breach …”

17     In uplifting the sentence imposed by the lower court, the High Court judge considered, amongst other things, that “_the need to disgorge profits should have been adequately assessed_”.

18     In my view, _Project Lifestyle_ does not support the Bifurcated Approach. From the judgment of the High Court, it would appear that the profits made by the defendant was merely regarded as a factor in calibrating the fine. There was nothing to suggest that the High Court judge had applied his mind to delineate the punitive and disgorgement components of the fine. In fact, since there was no evidence of the profits made by the defendant, it would not have been possible to determine the amount to be disgorged, even on a rough and ready basis, for the purposes of arriving at the appropriate quantum for the disgorgement component.

19     The prosecution also referred to two unreported decisions involving STA cases prosecuted under Section 12(1) of the Planning Act: _Public Prosecutor v Tan En Wei Terence & Anor_ (“_Terence Tan_”) and _Public Prosecutor v Michael Mega_ (“_Michael Mega_”). In its oral submissions, the prosecution contended that the Bifurcated Approach had been consistently applied in these cases. I failed to see how this was so.

20     In _Terence Tan_, the total profits made by the two accused persons was S$19,000. Each accused faced four charges. In sentencing, the learned District Judge imposed a fine of S$15,000 for each charge. However, there was no attempt made by the judge to delineate the punitive and disgorgement components of the fine. Instead, it was clear from the learned District Judge’s sentencing remarks that the approach he had taken was to first determine the overall fine to be imposed, before addressing his mind to the question of whether that fine was sufficient to disgorge the unlawful profits made by the accused persons. \[15\] to \[18\] of the District Judge’s Brief Sentencing Remarks in _Terence Tan_ are pertinent, and I reproduce the relevant portions below:-

> 15.    In light of the above, I am of the view that a fine of $20,000 per charge is appropriate.

> …

> 17.    I come back to the total profits of $19,000. There is no evidence tendered on how the profits were divided between the accused persons and we should therefore treat this sum as the combined profits of both accused persons. **As we are unable to break down the profits between the co-accused, we will therefore need to view this aggregate profits against the aggregate fines to be imposed against the both of them, i.e. $160,000 (being $80k multiplied by 2). This translates to around 8.4 times more than the overall profits of $19k. In my opinion, this was excessive**.

> 18.    In my view, there was also an overlap between the factual and legal elements of all 4 offences as against each accused person … **I am therefore of the view that the global fine of $80,000 ought to be reduced to $60,000.** **If one views the overall profits against the aggregate fines to be imposed against the both of them, i.e. $120,000 (being $60k multiplied by 2), this would translate to around 6.3 times more than the overall profits of $19,000. This aggregate fine, in my mind, would be sufficient to disgorge their overall profits** and deter the accused persons from reoffending …

> \[Emphasis in bold mine\]

21     In _Michael Mega_, there was a dispute as to the precise amount made by the accused from providing STA. The prosecution contended that the accused’s profits was between S$980 and S$1,900; the accused claimed he only made S$500. Yet, the district judge did not consider it necessary to hold a Newton hearing to address the issue. The judge imposed a fine of S$13,000 on the accused and considered this sufficient to disgorge whatever profits was made by the accused. Clearly, the Bifurcated Approach was not applied since there was no attempt by the court to determine the amount of profits made by the accused. In my view, the court’s approach was, in fact, similar to that taken in _Project Lifestyle_ and _Terence Tan_, _viz._, to first proceed with the determination of the appropriate fine to be imposed and subsequently, to then consider if that fine would be sufficient to have the effect of disgorging any profits made by the accused.

22     In my view, the approach taken in _Project Lifestyle_, _Terence Tan_ and _Michael Mega_ accorded with established sentencing principles. In this regard, in _Sentencing Principles in Singapore_ (Academy Publishing, 2019) at paragraph 26.002, the learned author wrote that fines serve a dual-objective: to punish and/or deter, and to disgorge any profits received by the offender from the illegal enterprise. The relevant portion of the text bears replicating here:-

> There are two key sentencing objectives when imposing fines:

>> (a)    The _primary_ objective is to punish (in the sense of retribution) and/or to deter.

>> (b)    If the offender has profited from his crime, then a _secondary_ objective is to disgorge him of such profits. Thus, it has been held that “\[if a fine is to be imposed, it\] should be such that it will take away from the convicted offender the desire to offend in a similar manner again. Quite clearly a balance of income left in \[an offender’s\] pocket after payment of a fine will have precisely the opposite effect and for a court to leave any such balance would be a wrong application of the accepted principles”: _Public Prosecutor v Goh Ah Moi_ <span class="citation">\[1949\] MLJ 155</span>.

> \[Emphasis in italics is that of the learned author\]

23     This further fortified my view that the Bifurcated Approach is not only without precedent, but also does not accord with trite sentencing principles and objectives. First, punishment and deterrence are the primary sentencing objectives of a fine. The disgorgement of profits is, on the other hand, a subordinate sentencing objective. Second, where a fine is imposed, the quantum of the fine should be sufficient to _also_ take away any ill-gotten gains from the offender. Taken together, this suggests that in cases where only a fine is imposed, the objective of punishment and deterrence should weigh foremost on the sentencing judge’s mind. Once the appropriate fine is calibrated, it is then considered if the fine is _also_ sufficient to disgorge any ill-gotten gains.

24     There are several problems with the Bifurcated Approach. First, as highlighted above, a fine should be high enough to achieve the objectives of deterrence and punishment, _and_ sufficient to ensure that the offender does not get to enjoy his spoils even after paying the fine. With the Bifurcated Approach, the court would never have to be concerned with having to balance these objectives. This is because any ill-gotten gains would be taken care of by the disgorgement component as a matter of course. This effectively limits any residual sentencing discretion (in calibrating the fine to be imposed) that the court has with respect to the disgorgement of profits.

25     Second, the Bifurcated Approach could result in an excessive or inordinate fine being imposed on the offender. In this respect, I agreed with the defence that the Bifurcated Approach gives rise to the risk of double counting. In determining the punitive component, factors such as the number and frequency of bookings and the period of offending are undoubtedly relevant. These are the very same factors that would affect the level of profits which, in turn, would be subject to disgorgement. Furthermore, if all the profits made by the offender are to be separately disgorged (in addition to the imposition of the fine), then arguably, the amount of profits made should not also be factored in when calibrating the punitive component. The offender would, otherwise, be punished twice over.

26     Third, the Bifurcated Approach would result in sentencing disparity and inconsistency as the quantum of the entire fine could wildly differ between similarly-placed offenders, depending on the profits each made. The profits made by an offender is, however, an unreliable indicia of an offender’s culpability or the harm caused (if any) in the context of STA offences prosecuted under Section 12(1) of the Planning Act. For example, profits could be influenced by the location of the property and the size or type of property. These factors, however, have no bearing on the gravity of the offence. The eventual fine imposed would thus be a distorted reflection of the gravity of the offence and the offending.

27     In sum, I was not convinced that the Bifurcated Approach was an appropriate sentencing approach for the present case and accordingly, rejected the same.

28     As regards the defence’s position, it was proposed that a harm-culpability sentencing framework be applied in the present case. The sentencing matrix would be in the mould of that established in _Logachev Vladislav v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 609</span>. I rejected the defence’s proposed sentencing framework. As the defence did not file an appeal, I do not propose to delve into the reasons for rejecting the proposed framework. Suffice to say, there were two that led to my decision. First, I was not convinced that the harm-culpability matrix was appropriate in STA cases. For one, it was unclear what type of “harm” actually results from the provision of STA. The defence cited dis-amenities suffered by the residents as one such example. However, it was not clear to me that dis-amenities was capable of being measured in an objective way for the purposes of drawing up an appropriate sentencing framework. Second, I did not agree with the characterisation of some of the “harm” and “culpability” factors. For example, the defence’s contention was that under the proposed framework, the duration of offending and the amount of profits made are factors to be considered in determining the level of harm caused. I did not agree that these factors were indicative of the level of harm and the defence failed to articulate why this was so.

## Reasons for the sentence imposed

29     In arriving at my decision, I followed the sentencing approach taken in _Project Lifestyle_, _Terence Tan_ and _Michael Mega_. This involved the following steps: (a) calibrating the appropriate fine taking into account all relevant aggravating and mitigating factors; (b) considering if the quantum arrived at sufficiently disgorges the Accused’s ill-gotten gains, and (c) applying the totality principle.

30     In _Project Lifestyle_, the High Court endorsed the starting range of punishments for “_typical_” or “_non-aggravated change of use_” cases under Section 12 of the Planning Act, which is a fine of between S$5,000 and S$10,000. This case fell outside the starting range in light of the aggravating factors present.

##### (a)    Offence-specific aggravating factors

31     I found that there was persistent offending in the present case. Despite the Accused’s close brush with the law in respect of the Lorong 27 Property, the Accused continued to engage in the proscribed activity. In respect of the 4th property and the 6th property, this went on for another 11 and 10 months respectively, before the scheme was unravelled. During this time, the Accused also leased four more properties, namely, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th properties, for this purpose. The Accused can be characterised as a recalcitrant offender. Instead of learning from his lesson the first time around and counting his good fortunes, he continued with and even compounded the offending. I have no doubt an appropriate dose of punishment would be required to achieve the aim of specific deterrence in this case.

32     Next, it is a well-established sentencing principle that where an offence is easy to commit but difficult to detect, a stiffer penalty would be warranted to achieve the objectives of specific and general deterrence (_Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> at \[25(d)\]). In the present case, the fact that the Accused’s scheme could be perpetrated over a period of close to a year before it was eventually uncovered, shows the difficulty with which STA offences are detected and enforced. The prosecution submitted that rental websites such as Airbnb allow offenders to “_hide behind a cloak of anonymity_”. Offenders often use pseudonyms and communicate exclusively with guests via Airbnb’s platform. According to the prosecution, Airbnb also obscures the exact location of the property and makes it available to the guest only 48 hours after a booking is confirmed, thus preventing the authorities from easily identifying offenders who list their residential properties online. In the Second Reading of the Planning (Amendment) Bill on 6 February 2017, the Minister for National Development Mr. Lawrence Wong clarified that advertising on home-sharing or rental websites is, in and of itself, not an offence because the listings typically do not indicate the tenure of the lease. Cumulatively, these reasons make detection and enforcement more difficult as the authorities would generally have to rely on complaints from residents or the public who suspect that a property is being used for the purposes of STA, or to conduct sting operations. In my view, a higher sentence would be appropriate in the present case to achieve the aims of specific and general deterrence.

33     The prosecution submitted that the duration of offending was significant as the Accused had engaged in providing STA for a period of close to one year. In my view, the duration of offending, taken in isolation, is not a meaningful way of determining the gravity of the offending. It was unclear what the occupancy or take-up rate of the properties was during this time. Certainly, it could not have been the case that the properties achieved full occupancy throughout the relevant period. There was no evidence of the frequency or volume of the bookings during this period. These factors would have been relevant since advertising the availability of the properties for STA, whilst a preparatory step towards committing the offence, is not an offence in itself. It is the actual letting of the premises for the purposes of STA that contravenes Section 12(1) of the Planning Act.

34     In this regard, the only evidence was that the Accused received about S$115,000 from providing STA in respect of the six properties over the relevant period, and that there were 60 reviews from previous guests for the 4th property alone. Based on paragraphs 13, 26 and 31 of the Statement of Facts, the daily rates for the 1st property, the 4th property and the 6th property were S$200, S$110 and S$118 respectively. I sought to work out, _albeit_ in rudimentary and rough fashion, the volume and frequency of the bookings by extrapolating this information. Taking the approximate average daily rate of S$143, the six properties would have been booked a total of 804 days[^2] and on average, each property would have been booked for a total of 134 days during this period. I should caveat that this rough computation does not take into account the fact that some of the properties were used for the purposes of STA for a longer period than others, or that the bookings would be of different durations. However, these figures alone suggested that the volume and frequency of bookings would have been quite high. I therefore agreed with the prosecution that this justified a higher sentence being imposed.

##### (b)    Offender-specific aggravating factors

35     Contrary to the prosecution’s submissions, I did not think that overt acts were taken by the Accused to avoid detection. As discussed above, the difficulties in detection and enforcement are probably inherent in the nature of the STA ‘business’. The prosecution submitted that “_the Accused made a calculated decision to rent units in the Geylang district in order to avoid detection and to lower his rental costs_”. This was a hollow assertion as there was no evidence or explanation as to why the Geylang district mattered. I also did not think that the Accused sought to avoid detection by changing the host-names of his Airbnb account. These host names are usually pseudonyms or monikers to begin with. Changing one pseudonym to another would not, in my view, have made detection any more difficult.

36     I disagreed with the prosecution’s submission that there was sophistication in the planning and operation of the Accused’s scheme. Overall, I found that the manner in which the Accused had conducted the STA business was nothing out of the ordinary. Granted, the Accused may have used the TCC as a cover to obtain some of the leases. However, I had considered this factor under the rubric of the Accused’s overall dishonest conduct, as discussed below.

37     Oddly, the defence appeared to concede that the Accused had abused his position as a registered estate agent, and that this was a relevant factor when determining the Accused’s culpability.[^3] In my view, there was no evidence that the Accused had abused his position as a registered estate agent. The properties were leased in either the Accused or TCC’s names. There was nothing to suggest that his position as a registered estate agent was instrumental in securing any of the leases. If the defence’s point was that the Accused, as an estate agent, knew or ought to have known that providing STA was illegal, that was a separate point altogether.

38     I found that there was dishonesty and deception on the Accused’s part at every turn.

> (1)     On 29 November 2017, the Accused was investigated by the URA for providing STA in respect of another property at 5 Lorong 27 Geylang #08-03 Singapore 388158 (“Lorong 27 Property”). During the investigation, the Accused lied to the URA officers that this was the only property being used for the purposes of providing STA. The Accused had, by then, already been providing STA in respect of the 4th property and the 6th property. The URA found that the Accused did provide STA to two guests from 30 September 2017 to 6 October 2017 in respect of the Lorong 27 Property. However, on account of what the Accused told the URA officers during the investigation on 29 November 2017, the URA exercised leniency and decided not to take prosecutorial action against the Accused.

> (2)     The Accused was a registered estate agent at the material time. He knew or would have known that providing STA was unlawful. The Accused thus misrepresented to the owners and/or their agents that the properties were either for his own stay, or to be used for his business. He knew that the owners would not have otherwise leased the properties to him. The Accused secured the tenancy for the 2nd property by spinning a tale that he and his wife were waiting to move into a new place. For the 6th property, the Accused lied to its owner that TCC needed a place to store its coffee machines and that its staff may reside in the unit at times. Furthermore, the lease agreements contained the standard clause permitting only the authorised occupants to reside in the properties. In respect of the 1st and 4th properties, the Accused was listed as the sole occupant. The Accused and his wife were listed as the occupants for the 2nd property. In so stating, the Accused perpetuated the deception on the owners.

> (3)     On 22 August 2018, following feedback by a resident of the condominium at which the 1st property was located, the property manager contacted the Accused to query about the “_many unknown persons with luggage entering and exiting_” the 1st property. Prior to this, the property manager had already approached a group of guests and ascertained that they had booked the 1st property through the Airbnb platform. The Accused, however, lied to the property manager that the guests were his business clients.

> (4)     On 2 September 2018, CISCO officers carried out an inspection at the 4th property. One Vicky Lee, an American citizen, was found to be residing in the premises at the time. She had booked the 4th property through the Airbnb platform for the period 1 September 2018 to 3 September 2018. When the CISCO officers interviewed the Accused over the phone, he lied to the officers that he and Vicky Lee were friends.

39     Further, the Accused was not the owner of the properties. He had no permission from the owners to sub-lease the properties. Not only had the Accused breached the lease agreements. He had unnecessarily implicated the owners of the properties who were innocent third-parties. In most instances, the authorities would first look to the registered proprietor or owner when a complaint is received. This would have caused them unnecessary inconvenience.

40     Finally, two charges were taken into consideration (“TIC Charges”) for the purposes of sentencing. It is trite law that if there are charges taken into consideration, the court has a discretion to increase the sentence for the proceeded charges (_Public Prosecutor v UI_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 500</span>). In the present case, I noted that the period of offending for the TIC Charges was short. It was also unclear what the volume and frequency of bookings for the 3rd and 5th properties were during the relevant periods. Hence, I did not think this factor alone justified a significant uplift in the sentence.

##### (c)    Mitigating factors

41     I turn now to consider the mitigating factors put forward by the defence. Save that I gave due credit for the Accused’s clean record and remorse, I considered the other mitigating factors put forward to be rather unremarkable and, in some ways, disingenuous.

42     It was submitted that the Accused did not know that providing STA was illegal. He claimed that he was under the impression that the “_rule against short-term rental under 6 months was only a guideline and would not be enforced_” and in this respect, sought to blame the authorities for sending out “_mixed messages_”.[^4] I found this assertion hard to believe and untenable. As a registered estate agent, the Accused would have been attuned to the changes in rules and legislation regulating the industry. Furthermore, if the Accused genuinely did not know about the law at the material time, there would have been no reason for him to lie to the owners of the properties as regards his true intentions. More importantly, by 29 November 2017, the Accused would have been aware that providing STA was illegal. This was when URA conducted an investigation with respect to the Lorong 27 Property. Yet, the Accused continued in his wrongful ways. The Accused also sought to allude, albeit obliquely, to URA’s decision not to prosecute him in November 2017 as justification for him to continue providing STA.[^5] I found these attempts to justify his wrongful acts at this juncture to have a diluting effect on his mitigation plea.

43     The Accused claimed that he was driven to providing STA due to his financial needs. Amongst other things, he cited the downturn in the property market as a result of the property cooling measures introduced by the government, and the need to support his aged parents and three children as reasons for offending. I did not consider these to be exceptional or extreme circumstances that carried any mitigating value (see _Lai Oei Mui Jenny v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] 2 SLR(R) 406</span> at \[10\]). I did not accord any weight to this factor.

44     In my view, the fact that there were no complaints by the residents about any dis-amenities or disturbances was, at best, a neutral factor. Such complaints, had they existed, would have been an aggravating factor. Its mere absence in the present case does not constitute a mitigating factor: _Edwin s/o Suse Nathan v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 4 SLR 1139</span> at \[24\].

45     I accepted that the Accused was remorseful for his actions. This was evident from the full cooperation that he extended to the authorities, for example, by providing relevant information and documents such as bank statements and tenancy agreements to the authorities when he was investigated in August 2018. He also terminated the remaining leases within one month of the conclusion of URA’s investigations. It may be tempting to view the Accused’s early plea of guilty with some cynicism, in light of the odds that were stacked against him. However, looking at his actions in totality, I considered that he should be given the benefit of doubt and to regard his early plea of guilt as evidence of his remorse.

46     Lastly, the Accused highlighted his contributions to society and his charitable deeds.[^6] These largely involved selling TCC’s coffee at various charitable events and donating the sale proceeds. This would also have involved the Accused sacrificing his time and effort for the less fortunate in society. I noted that his charitable works preceded the period of offending. In line with the High Court’s comments in _Stansilas Fabian Kester v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 755</span> at \[102\], I considered the Accused’s offending to be a one-off aberration, a sustained one notwithstanding. Accordingly, my view was that some mitigating value should be attached to this factor, although this would be muted by the aggravating factors present.

##### (d)    Calibrating the sentence

47     As mentioned above, there are no reported decisions concerning STA offences prosecuted under Section 12(1) of the Planning Act. The prosecution thus referred to three unreported decisions: _Terence Tan_, _Michael Mega_ and _Public Prosecutor v Chen Ching-Chih_ \[URA 17 – 20 of 2018, unreported\] (“_Chen Ching-Chih_”).

48      _Terence Tan_ was the first prosecution of STA offences under the Planning Act. In that case, two accused persons each faced four charges for using four units in the D’Leedon condominium for the purposes of STA. The offending went on for a period of five weeks. The total amount received by both accused persons was about S$19,000. The district judge imposed a fine of S$15,000 for each charge. The total fine imposed on each accused was S$60,000.

49     In _Michael Mega_, the accused faced one charge for providing STA under Section 12(1) of the Planning Act. He rented out the unused rooms in the unit he owned to 10 guests over a period of about 2 months. Prior to this charge, he was served with an Enforcement Notice in 2016. As highlighted above, his financial gain was disputed. The prosecution estimated it to be between S$900 and S$1,900 while the accused claimed it was only S$500. The district judge imposed a fine of S$13,000 on the accused.

50     In _Chen Ching-Chih_, the accused pleaded guilty to two charges. Two other similar charges were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. The period of offending was about one year. The total proceeds received by the accused in respect of all four charges was S$101,000. The district judge imposed a fine of S$35,000 for each charge resulting in a global fine of S$70,000.

51     I did not consider _Michael Mega_ and _Chen Ching-Chih_ to be of any assistance in calibrating the appropriate sentence to be imposed in the present case. As the High Court cautioned in _Luong Thi Trang Hoang Kathleen v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 1 SLR 707</span> at \[21\], undue reliance should not be placed on unreported precedents because “_a proper appraisal of the particular facts and circumstances is simply lacking_”. It was not possible to find a common thread or rationale in the sentences imposed in both these cases. Conversely, whilst _Terence Tan_ was an unreported case, I had the benefit of the court’s Brief Sentencing Remarks which set out the reasons for the sentence imposed.

52     Even though _Project Lifestyle_ was a case involving Section 12(2) of the Planning Act, I was of the view that it provided a useful reference point. This is supported by the High Court’s observation (at \[4\] of _Project Lifestyle_) that an offence within a conservation area _per se_ should not be regarded as more serious than one not involving a conservation area. Whilst this does not mean that a single sentencing framework should be applied across the Section 12 Planning Act offences, there was no doubt the sentencing considerations could be similar and relevant for Section 12(1) and Section 12(2) offences.

53      _Project Lifestyle_ was a case that concerned a material change of use of premises from a restaurant to a bar without conservation permission. In uplifting the sentence imposed by the court below, the High Court considered the following factors. First, the nature of the change had clearly impacted the heritage character of the area, which is recognised for its rich historical and cultural significance. The High Court also considered that there would also plausibly have been some disquiet given the close proximity to Malay-Muslim landmarks in the immediate vicinity (see \[9\]). Second, there was “_persistent (and continuing) breach_” as the defendant company failed to take any remedial steps even after being convicted of the offence. The High Court found that this was evidence of the defendant’s lack of remorse (see \[10\]). Third, the High Court found that “_running the restaurant quite openly as a bar would at least have contributed to a material change in the “look and feel” of the area_” (see \[11\]). Fourth, the High Court considered that the defendant’s offending was driven by profit motive (see \[12\]). The High Court imposed a fine of S$35,000 on the defendant.

54     To my mind, the offending in the present case was less serious than in _Project Lifestyle_. As the prosecution noted, the underlying rationale for outlawing STA was “_to prevent dis-amenity to neighbouring residents, including privacy and security-related concerns arising from the high turnover of transient guests in residential estates and developments_”.[^7] Unlike _Project Lifestyle_, there was no evidence in the present case that dis-amenities were caused. This was supported by the prosecution’s own submission that the Accused only chose properties in the Geylang district in order to avoid detection. Presumably, the prosecution’s point was either that the guests could easily ‘blend’ into the neighbourhood, or that residents in that area were not concerned with transient guests. If so, any potential dis-amenities would appear to be minimal. The persistency of offending was also more egregious in _Project Lifestyle_. In the present case, the Accused ceased offending as soon as investigations were conducted in August 2018. It may be argued that but for the Accused’s lies to the URA officers in November 2017, he would have been prosecuted. However, the flipside to that argument was that, had he been prosecuted and convicted in 2017, he may well have stopped providing STA.

55     Furthermore, the change of use in the present case was not material. The properties continued to be used for residential purposes. They were not converted to a wholly different use. It was only by reason that the period of accommodation for each guest was less than three months that made each transaction run afoul of the Planning Act. Just to make this point starker: if a person provided accommodation to a guest for two and a half months, he would have committed an offence under the Planning Act. However, if he had provided accommodation to a guest for three months, no offence would have been committed. Save that the difference in accommodation period was half a month, I can see no other appreciable difference in the nature or use of the premises.

56     In light of the foregoing analysis, I was of the view that the appropriate fine in this case should be less than that imposed in _Project Lifestyle_, but more than that imposed in _Terence Tan_. Taking into account the aggravating and mitigating factors, my view was that a fine of S$25,000 for each of the 1st and 2nd charges, and a fine of $30,000 for each of the 4th and 6th charges, would be appropriate. The global fine imposed on the Accused would thus be S$110,000.

57     It was at this stage that I considered if the fine _also_ achieved the aim of disgorging the profits made by the Accused. In this regard, I disagreed with the prosecution’s submission that in computing the profits made by the Accused, the court should have no regard to the expenses incurred. As highlighted above, the objective of disgorgement is to take away _whatever ill-gotten gains are in the offender’s pocket_. To take away anything more would be punitive in nature, which is not the objective of disgorgement. Ultimately, the burden is on the offender to prove that he incurred the expenses and the court has to be satisfied that the expenses were not unrelated to the offending, unnecessary or unreasonable (_Koh Jaw Hung_ at \[48\]).

58     In the present case, I accepted that the rent paid by the Accused to the owners of the properties constituted reasonable expenses. This worked out to approximately S$69,300 for the six properties over the period of offending.[^8] The Accused also claimed that he incurred monthly utility fees of S$200 to S$300 for each property, and the same amount for the monthly cleaning fees.[^9] However, there was no evidence to support this claim. As regards the monthly utility fees, these are typically included in the rental already. There was no basis for the Accused to include this as a separate expense. I also rejected the Accused’s contention that he had to prematurely terminate the tenancy agreements “_to stop the STA business_”.[^10] That was a _non-sequitur_. The Accused _could_ continue with the tenancy agreements. He just could not continue using these properties to provide STA. In light thereof, the unlawful profits that had to be disgorged was approximately S$46,000. There was no question the fines to be imposed would not leave a balance in the Accused’s pocket.

59     Finally, I was obliged to take a ‘last look’ at all the facts and circumstances and be satisfied that the aggregate sentence is sufficient and proportionate to the Accused’s level of criminality (_Seng Foo Building Construction Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 3 SLR 201</span>). Having done so, I was not so satisfied. I considered that the offences overlapped as regards the period of offending. Whilst there may have been dishonesty on the Accused’s part, the offence he was charged with was not one that censures dishonest conduct or moral failings, but one that merely regulates the use of land. Furthermore, there was no tangible or appreciable harm or loss caused, whether to the landlords, the guests or neighbouring residents. As such, my view was that the fine had to be moderated downwards. It was in this context that I imposed the sentences that I did which, to reiterate for convenience, was a fine of S$20,000 (carrying a default imprisonment term of four (4) weeks) for each of the first and second charges and a fine of S$24,000 (with a default imprisonment term of five (5) weeks) for each of the fourth and sixth charges.
