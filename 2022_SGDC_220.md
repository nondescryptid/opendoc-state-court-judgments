\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9179/2022/01.\]

27 September 2022

### District Judge Paul Chan:

1       The accused, Mr Prem Kumar s/o Sarkuna Rajah, is a Singapore citizen, aged 49. He pleaded guilty to a single charge of consuming a Class A controlled drug without any authorisation. I sentenced him to three years and six months’ imprisonment. On 14 September 2022, the accused was granted leave to file an appeal out of time. As he has now appealed against the sentence, I provide the full reasons for my decision.

## Charge

2       The charge faced by the accused was on the following terms.

> You… are charged that you, on or before 14 March 2020, in Singapore, did consume a Class A Controlled Drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“**MDA**”), _to wit_, **2-\[1-(5-Fluoropentyl)-1H-indole-3-carboxamido\]-3,3-dimethylbutanoic acid or its hexanoic acid isomer or any of their respective fluoro positional isomer in the pentyl group**, without any authorisation under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 8(b)(i) of the MDA,

> and further, that you, before the commission of the said offence, were on 20 November 2009 in Subordinate Court No. 12 _vide_ DAC42403/2009, convicted of an offence for consumption of a specified drug, _to wit_, Morphine, under Section 8(b)(ii) of the MDA punishable under Section 33A(1) of the MDA, and sentenced to 5 years and 6 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane, which conviction has not been set aside to date, and you shall now be punished under Section 33(4) of the MDA.

## Facts

3       The Prosecution relied on a Statement of Facts in support of the charge, which is reproduced below.

> 2.    On 14 March 2020, at about 7 am, the accused and one Sasintheran s/o Rachandran (“**Sasi**”) were arrested by officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“**CNB**”) someplace around the carpark of Blk 226A Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 Singapore 561226, for suspected drug activity.

> 3.    At the material time, the accused was driving a lorry and Sasi was his passenger. The accused stopped his lorry at the incident location and Sasi alighted from the lorry. Thereafter, CNB officers arrived at the scene and inspected the accused’s lorry, where they found and seized drug exhibits.

> 4.    In the course of CNB’s investigations, the accused was brought to CNB HQ on 14 March 2020, where he was required to provide his urine samples. The accused provided 2 bottles of his urine samples which were sealed “CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU” and marked:

>> a.    ‘C-SA-20-00398-1 PREM KUMAR S/O SARKUNA RAJAH SXXX’ and

>> b.    ‘C-SA-20-00398-2 PREM KUMAR S/O SARKUNA RAJAH SXXX’

> respectively in his presence. The said urine samples were sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“**HSA**”) on 16 March 2020 for analysis.

> 5.    On 23 March 2020 and 25 March 2020, Ng Chee Ann and Maggie Tiong Su, analysts with the HSA issued certificates under section 16 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185, 2008 Rev. Ed.) (“**MDA**”) bearing Lab number AT-2033-01932-001-11 and AT-2033-01932-002-11 respectively, stating that on analysis, the accused’s urine samples were found to contain 2-\[1-(5-Fluoropentyl)-1H-indole-3-carboxamido\]-3,3-dimethylbutanoic acid or its hexanoic acid isomer or any of their respective fluoro positional isomer in the pentyl group.

> 6.    2-\[1-(5-Fluoropentyl)-1H-indole-3-carboxamido\]-3,3-dimethylbutanoic acid or its hexanoic acid isomer or any of their respective fluoro positional isomer in the pentyl group are Class A controlled drugs listed in the First Schedule to the MDA.

> 7.    On or before 14 March 2020, the accused had knowingly consumed a drug containing 2-\[1-(5-Fluoropentyl)-1H-indole-3-carboxamido\]-3,3-dimethylbutanoic acid or its hexanoic acid isomer or any of their respective fluoro positional isomer in the pentyl group. He is not authorised to consume 2-\[1-(5-Fluoropentyl)-1H-indole-3-carboxamido\]-3,3-dimethylbutanoic acid or its hexanoic acid isomer or any of their respective fluoro positional isomer in the pentyl group under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder, and he has thereby committed an offence under Section 8(b)(i) of the MDA.

> 8.    Prior to the commission of the said offence, the accused had been convicted on 20 November 2009, in Subordinate Court No. 12 (DAC42403/2009), of consumption of Morphine, a Specified Drug, under Section 8(b)(ii) of the MDA punishable under Section 33A(1) of the MDA, to which he was sentenced to 5 years and 6 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane, which conviction has not been set aside. He is now liable to be punished under Section 33(4) of the MDA.

> 9.    Sasi was separately dealt with in Case No. SC-902266-2020 on 8 November 2021.

## Prescribed penalty

4       As the accused is a repeat offender, he is liable to be punished under section 33(4) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“**MDA**”). That provision provides a minimum sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment.

## Antecedents

5       The accused has a lengthy list of antecedents beginning from 1991. The following is the list of drug-related antecedents only.

## Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

6       Having regard to the accused’s antecedents, the Prosecution sought a 6 month-uplift from the mandatory minimum sentence because of the need for specific deterrence. In this regard, the Prosecution relied on the case of _Public Prosecutor v Mohamed Sultan bin Abdul Rahmin_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 264</span> (“**_Mohamed Sultan_**”).

## Mitigation and Defence’s submissions on sentence

7       The accused was not represented at the hearing. In mitigation, the accused submitted that since 2013, he has been working hard and contributing back to society. He also informed the Court that his father and mother are 75 and 73 years of age, respectively. He was worried that his parents would pass away while he was serving sentence. Finally, the accused highlighted that he was caught with a friend, Mr Sasintheran s/o Rachandran (the “Co-accused Person”) who also consumed drugs. The accused informed the Court that the Co-accused Person was sentenced to 1 year’s imprisonment for a charge of drug consumption.

8       Although the accused was not represented at the hearing, he was represented until 7 September 2021. Before counsel was discharged, counsel had filed a mitigation plea on behalf of the accused. In fairness to the accused, I had considered this mitigation plea. In this mitigation plea, counsel submitted that the mandatory minimum sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment should be imposed. In this regard, counsel relied on _Public Prosecutor v Mohamed Wahaie bin Sa’ad_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 102</span> (“**_Mohamed Wahaie_**”), _Public Prosecutor v Abdul Jalil bin Mohamad Yusof_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 102</span> (“**_Abdul Jalil_**”) and _Public Prosecutor v Radika d/o Rajavarma_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 190</span> (“**_Radika d/o Rajavarma_**”). In the mitigation plea, it was submitted that the accused was not a recalcitrant offender. Further, any need for specific deterrence was also factored into the enhanced sentence provided for repeat offenders under section 33(4) of the MDA.

## Judgment of the Court

9       In the present case, deterrence, both general and specific, was the predominant sentencing consideration. As regards general deterrence, it is apposite to recall the reminder by the High Court in _Dinesh Singh Bhatia s/o Amarjeet Singh v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGHC 63</span> (“**_Dinesh Singh Bhatia_**”) (at \[59\]) that “\[t\]he consumption of drugs is a grave menace and an anathema to the fabric and well-being of society and must be uncompromisingly stamped out. It must now be clearly and unfailingly understood that all drug offences involving the possession or consumption of Class A drugs inexorably attract custodial sentences, save in purely exceptional cases.” This strict approach towards drug consumption continues to hold true.

10     Further, in the present case, the accused is a repeat offender for drug offences. This called into operation the principle of specific deterrence. This principle “operates on the understanding that there would be reduction of the possibility of recidivism through the prospect of having to experience a similar or more severe sanction”: _Public Prosecutor v Loqmanul Hakim bin Buang_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR(R) 753</span> (“**_Loqmanul_**”) (at \[29\]). In assessing whether to increase a sentence for the purpose of specific deterrence, the question that must be answered is whether an increased sentence reduces the propensity of the accused to risk further punishment through the commission of another crime: _Loqmanul_ (at \[29\]).

11     In my judgment, it is necessary to increase the sentence from the mandatory minimum of 3 years’ imprisonment. It is, of course, correct that section 33(4) of the MDA already provides an enhanced punishment for repeat offenders. However, the accused had not just one but two previous court convictions for drug consumption. In 2000, the accused was sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment for consumption of cannabinol derivatives. In 2009, the accused was sentenced to long term imprisonment of 5 years and 6 months and 3 strokes of the cane for consumption of morphine. These punishments did not deter the accused from re-offending.

12     Quite apart from his court convictions, the accused also had multiple other antecedents wherein he was placed under drug supervision or was detained in a drug rehabilitation centre. I considered these relevant for the purposes of sentencing. As the High Court held in _Mohammad Faizal bin Sabtu v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 4 SLR 947</span> (at \[49\]):

> Consistent with the sentencing policy of the courts, there would be nothing to prevent a court from treating a previous DRC admission as an aggravating factor for the purposes of punishing an offender. Indeed, in my view, the courts would be fully justified in doing so for the reason which I stated during the hearing of this Special Case, namely: a DRC admission is designed to rehabilitate a drug addict for his personal benefit and in the larger societal interest.

13     Apart from his two terms of imprisonment, the accused was placed on drug supervision on no less than five occasions and was detained at a drug rehabilitation centre on another two occasions. I was mindful that his last antecedent in this regard was in 2013. However, I was not of the view that this antecedent was so dated as to be considered irrelevant. Rather, this was a case where there was convincing evidence of repeated drug abuse and a history of flagrant disregard of the MDA such that it was appropriate for the accused to receive his just dessert in the form of a sentence above the mandatory minimum: see _Dinesh Singh Bhatia_ (at \[60\]).

14     In calibrating the appropriate uplift, I had regard to the case of _Muhamad Sultan_. In that case, the accused pleaded guilty to three charges, including one for unauthorised consumption of 2-\[1-(5-Fluoropentyl)-1H-indazole-3-carboxamido\]-3,3-dimethylbutanoic acid and its hexanoic isomer and their respective fluoro positional isomers in the pentyl group, which was the precise drug in question in the present case. The offender in _Muhamad Sultan_ had three previous convictions for possession of controlled drugs and was incarcerated at a drug rehabilitation centre on another six occasions. The court in that case found it necessary to impose an uplift of six months’ imprisonment from the mandatory minimum sentence. I agreed with the Prosecution that the same sentence should be imposed in the present case.

15     In doing so, I was mindful that the court in _Mohamed Wahaie_ and _Abdul Jalil_ did not impose any uplift to the mandatory minimum sentence. However, the Prosecution in those cases did not seek a sentence beyond 3 years’ imprisonment. In fact, in _Abdul Jalil_, the court held that “there were good grounds to have imposed a sentence that was marginally higher than the prescribed minimum sentence of three years’ imprisonment” (at \[10\]). Nevertheless, the court did not do so in the final analysis in consideration of the number of charges involved and the operation of the one transaction rule and the totality principle. I was also mindful that the present case was not as egregious as the case of _Radika d/o Rajavarma_ where an uplift six months’ imprisonment was imposed. Nevertheless, I was of the view that an uplift was also justified on the present facts.

16     In relation to the argument that the Co-accused Person was only sentenced to 1 year’s imprisonment for a charge of drug consumption, I noted that the principle of parity did not apply. The accused and the Co-accused Person were not similarly situated as the Co-accused Person was a first-time offender.

17     Finally, the fact that the accused’s parents are aged and may pass away while the accused is incarcerated possessed, in my view, no mitigating weight. At the moment, this argument was no more than a supposition. In any event, even if this does come to pass, this would merely be a consequence of the accused having to pay his dues to society.

## Conclusion

18     For the above reasons, I sentenced the accused to three years and six months’ imprisonment. The accused is presently serving sentence.
