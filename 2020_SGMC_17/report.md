27 March 2020

### District Judge Adam Nakhoda:

Mr Rahman Mohammed Ataur (“Mr Ataur”) pleaded guilty to one charge of being a self-employed foreigner for the purpose of gain without obtaining a valid pass to allow him to work in Singapore. I sentenced Mr Ataur to a fine of $8,000. Mr Ataur being dissatisfied with the sentence has appealed. He has paid the fine.

## PROCEEDED CHARGES

2       The charge against Mr Ataur was as follows:

> **MAC 909325 of 2020**

> _You, are charged that you, from sometime in April 2017 to 2 October 2018, were a self-employed foreigner engaging in the services of food delivery and freelance construction worker in several locations in Singapore, for the purpose of gain without obtaining a valid work pass which allow you to work in Singapore, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 10(1) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Chapter 91A), punishable under section 10(2)(a) of the same Act._

## THE FACTS

3       Mr Ataur had, since 25 March 2010, held a work permit to work as a construction worker under Kuan Bee Construction (“the company”). Mr Ataur had worked for the company for six years, however, sometime in April 2017, Mr Ataur began to source for his own employment. Mr Ataur entered into an agreement with Mr Ng Koon Ann (“Mr Ng”), the sole-proprietor of the company, to maintain his work permit. Mr Ataur would pay Mr Ng a monthly sum of $1,000 to maintain his work permit and to pay for the levy.

4       From April 2017, the accused was self-employed in providing food delivery services to Bangladeshi workers in the Serangoon Road and in Geylang. Mr Ataur bought food from a restaurant in Serangoon Road and would then sell and deliver the food to foreign workers. In addition, Mr Ataur worked as a freelance construction workers at sites in Singapore. He was arrested at a construction site on 2 October 2018.

## ANTECEDENTS

5       Mr Ataur was untraced.

## PROSECUTION’S SUBMISSION

6       The Prosecuting Officer, Ms Elaine Cai (“Ms Cai”) tendered a table of sentencing precedents and, based on the precedents, submitted that a fine between $8,000 to $9,000 was appropriate. Ms Cai informed the Court that Mr Ng had been fined $8,000 for an offence of abetting by intentionally aiding Mr Ataur to work as a self-employed foreigner without a valid work pass, an offence under section 10(1) read with section 23(1) EFMA.

## MITIGATION

7       Defence Counsel, Mr Revi Shankar (“Mr Revi”) made an oral mitigation plea. He emphasised that Mr Ataur was a first-time offender and that he was remorseful.

8       Mr Revi submitted that the offence had arisen out of an agreement between Mr Ataur and Mr Ng. However, Mr Revi did not elaborate on how the existence of this agreement was mitigating.

9       Mr Revi submitted that the Court should impose a fine of $5,000. It would appear that Mr Revi’s primary submission was that Mr Ng was more culpable than Mr Ataur because Mr Ng had pleaded guilty to another two charges[^1] and that the fine against Mr Ataur should be less than the $8,000 imposed on Mr Ng.

## DECISION

## A.    Legislative Objectives

10     Section 6 of the Employment of Foreign Worker’s Act (Cap 91A) (“EFWA”) was repealed and re-enacted as section 10 of the EMFA on 1 June 2007 and imposed, for a contravention of the provision, a sentence of a maximum fine of $15,000 and/or imprisonment up to 12 months.

11     With the amendments to the EFMA in 2012, the sentences for a contravention of section 10 were increased to a maximum fine of $20,000 and/or imprisonment for up to two years. During his second reading speech moving the Employment of Foreign Manpower Bill, on 11 September 2012, Acting Minister for Manpower Mr Tan Chuan-Jin, said as follows:

> _“Sir, the proposed amendments to the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act will enhance the Government’s ability to ensure the integrity of our work pass framework. … In totality, the changes will allow my Ministry to step up enforcement actions against errant employers_, **_errant foreign workers_** _and syndicates expeditiously and effectively, thereby enhancing deterrence against EMFA contraventions, which ultimately hurts Singaporeans. …_

> **_To further enhance deterrence, we will increase maximum penalties for EFMA contraventions_** **…” \[Emphasis min\]**

12     I found that Mr Ataur’s actions of working as a self-employed foreigner in two professions, i.e. as in food delivery services and as a construction worker, would have the effect of potentially depriving other workers, both Singaporeans and foreigners, of employment opportunities. Mr Ataur is precisely the sort of errant foreign worker who abuse the work pass framework that the EMFA aimed to deter.

## B.    Table of Sentencing Precedents

13     In the present case, Mr Ataur’s period of illegal employment (“PIE”) was approximately one year and six months.

14     Ms Cai’s table of precedents listed four cases where accused persons had pleaded guilty to offences under section 10(1) EMFA:

> a.     In _Public Prosecutor v Chandra Mohan Elango[^2]_: the accused had abetted a foreign worker to be a self-employed foreigner without a valid work-pass. The accused had abetted the foreigner to work as a part-time cleaner over a period of one year and one month. In consideration for the accused maintaining her work pass, the foreigner did household chores for the accused. The accused was fined $8,500.

> b.     In _Public Prosecutor v Zhang Yiqing[^3]:_ the accused worked as a self-employed foreigner without a valid work-pass carrying out construction work. The PIE was one year and ten months. The accused was fined $9,000.

> c.     In _Public Prosecutor v Aye Aye Mon[^4]:_ the accused worked as a self-employed foreigner carrying out work as a freelance domestic worker. The PIE was one year and five months. The accused agreed to have an additional charge under section 22(1)(a) EFMA of failing to reside at the residential address stated on her work permit taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. The accused was fined $8,000.

> d.     In _Public Prosecutor v Javier Catherine Roy[^5]_: the accused, whilst holding a work permit to work as a foreign domestic worker, instead worked as a self-employed foreigner working as a waitress at pubs. The accused pleaded guilty to another charge under section 22(1)(d) EFMA and agreed to have another two charges under section 22(1)(d) taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. The PIE was one year and nine months. The accused was fined $9,000.

## D.    Appropriate sentence

15     The primary sentencing consideration for offences under section 10(1) is general deterrence. As stated above, Mr Ataur, by working as a self-employed foreigner in two professions was clearly abusing the work pass framework and he was depriving other Singaporeans and/or foreigners of job opportunities. Therefore, I found that there was no reason to deviate from the usual sentences that would be imposed for cases like this.

16     As was apparent from the Prosecution’s table of precedents the usual sentence imposed for a section 10(1) offence was a fine. I found that for such offences, in the absence of additional aggravating or mitigating factors, the primary determinant of the quantum of the fine would be the length of time the accused had been a self-employed foreigner, i.e. the PIE.

17     The PIE in this case was approximately one year and six months. The precedents show that for offences involving PIEs between one year and one month and one year and ten months fines ranging between $8,000 to $9,000 have been imposed. I found that this was the appropriate range for the fine in the present case. I noted that, in terms of the PIE, the present case was more egregious than _Chandra Mohan Elango._

18     In _Chong Han Rui v Public Prosecutor[^6]_, the Chief Justice in considering the issue of parity in sentencing, held at \[1 & 47\]:

> _“1_      _Consistency in sentencing is a key principle in our criminal justice system. This is rooted in the notion that all are equal before the law (Public Prosecutor v Ng Sae Kiat and other appeals <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 167</span> (“Ng Sae Kiat”) at \[76\], citing Green v R (2011) 283 ALR 1 at \[30\]). The principle of parity in sentencing between co-offenders urges that sentences meted out to co-offenders who are party to a common criminal enterprise should not be unduly disparate from each other. To put it simply, those of similar culpability should receive similar sentences, while those of greater culpability should generally be more severely punished …_

> _47_      _The crucial consideration in considering the application of the parity principle is not whether the accused feels aggrieved that a co-accused person has been treated more leniently, but whether the public, with knowledge of the various sentences, would perceive that the appellant had suffered injustice …”_

19     In the present case, I found that Mr Ataur’s and Mr Ng’s culpability were similar. I disagreed with Mr Revi’s submission that Mr Ng’s culpability was greater than Mr Ataur’s because Mr Ng had pleaded guilty to an additional three charges. Mr Ng pleaded guilty to one charge under section 22(1)(d) EFMA for making a false statement in connection with the application for a work pass for Mr Ataur and two charges under section 22A(1)(b) EFMA for receiving a sum of money from Mr Ataur in order to maintain Mr Ataur’s work permit. Mr Ng agreed to have a further five charges under section 22A(1)(b) taken into consideration.

20     The additional charges that Mr Ng pleaded guilty too were separate and distinct from the section 10(1) offence and he was sentenced for those offences. The five charges that were taken into consideration would have had an effect on the sentence to be imposed on the two section 22A(1)(b) charges that Mr Ng admitted to, but would not necessarily have had an effect on the sentence for the section 10(1) offence.

21     As such, I found that the parity principle was engaged in the present case and that it would be appropriate to impose a similar sentence for Mr Ataur’s section 10(1) offence as the sentence that was imposed on Mr Ng for his section 10(1) offence.

22     I took into account the fact that Mr Ataur was a first-time offender and that his early plea of guilt was an indication of his remorse. However, there were no other aggravating or mitigating factors that would warrant a departure from the fine range that I referred to above. Therefore, I imposed a fine of $8,000 on Mr Ataur.
