Civil Procedure – Pleadings – Amendment – Amendment of writ and statement of claim to alter capacity – O 20 r 5 of the Rules of Court 2014

3 November 2022

### District Judge Jill Tan Li Ching :

1       This was a Registrar’s Appeal (“**RA**”) against the decision of the Deputy Registrar (“**DR**”), striking out the plaintiff/appellant’s claim in DC/S 199/2022. After hearing parties and considering their submissions, I allowed the appeal in part. These are the grounds of my decision.

## Facts

### Background

2       On 30 June 2018, the appellant’s husband (“**the deceased**”) was riding a motorcycle which collided into a taxi driven by the respondent. On 15 July 2018, he succumbed to his injuries. On 23 February 2021, the appellant, as administrator of the deceased’s estate, filed a suit against the respondent for, _inter alia_, damages for the benefit of the deceased’s estate under s 20 of the Civil Law Act 1909 (“**CLA**”), and damages for the benefit of the deceased’s dependants including bereavement under s 21(2) of the CLA.

3       Unfortunately for the appellant, as at February 2021, she had only obtained letters of administration (“**LA**”) in Malaysia, but had yet to re-seal them in Singapore, and had not obtained LA in Singapore. The re-sealing of the Malaysian LA in Singapore was completed only on 18 February 2022.

### Striking out

4       Although interlocutory judgment (“**IJ**”) was entered by consent (“**consent IJ**”) in April 2022 for 100% of liability to be borne by the respondent, the respondent subsequently filed an application for the suit to be struck out, on the basis that the appellant had no capacity to sue when the suit was filed, and that the writ of summons (“**writ**”) was thus a nullity. This application was granted by the DR, after he made four findings:

> (a)     First, that the action was a nullity when it was commenced as the Appellant had no capacity to sue as the administrator of the deceased’s estate until the Malaysian LA were re-sealed.

> (b)     Second, that the subsequent local sealing of the LA did not have a retrospective curative effect.

> (c)     Third, that the consent IJ did not constitute a bar to the striking out of the action, since if the action was a nullity at filing, the consent IJ would have been a nullity too.

> (d)     Fourth, that the dependency portion of the claim could not be rescued from the estate portion of the claim.

5       Costs of the application were fixed at $4,000, while costs of the action were fixed at $7,500, with reasonable disbursements to be taxed if not agreed, and applicable GST on both. The costs and disbursements were to be paid by the appellant’s solicitors to the respondent.

### Registrar’s Appeal

6       The appellant filed an appeal against the whole of the DR’s decision. The three grounds of appeal were that the DR had erred as follows:

> (a)     First, the respondent had consented to IJ being entered and there was no application or basis for the respondent to set aside the IJ;

> (b)     Second, the appellant having obtained LA in Malaysia, was entitled to commence the present suit against the respondent in Singapore; and

> (c)     Third, for failing to allow the appellant’s dependency claim to proceed.

7       However, at the first hearing of the RA, Counsel for the appellant Mr Christopher Chong informed the court that the appellant would not be pursuing the first two grounds of appeal, thus conceding the estate claim. The appellant would pursue only the dependency claim, that is, the third ground of appeal.

8       To this end, Mr Chong sought leave to amend the writ and statement of claim (“**SOC**”) by doing the following:

> (a)     Deleting all references to:

>> (i)       the appellant as administrator (including in the title of the suit);

>> (ii)       the claims on behalf of the estate such as particulars of general and special damages;

>> (iii)       the prayers for damages under s 20 of the CLA and for funeral expenses; and

> (b)     Amending the prayer originally made for “Damages for the benefit of the Deceased’s dependants including bereavement under section 21(2) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43)”, to one for “Damages for the benefit of the Deceased’s dependants under section 20 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43) including bereavement under section 21(2) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43)”.

These will be referred to collectively where necessary as “**the amendments sought**”.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

9       Para 1 of the original SOC stated as follows:

> “The Plaintiff is the widow of the late ANA A/L BATUMALAI (“the Deceased”) and she is the Administrator of the Estate of the Deceased. The Plaintiff brings this action for the benefit of the Deceased’s Estate and for the benefit of the Deceased’s dependants under the Civil Law Act (Cap. 43). The Grant of Letters of Administration was issued to the Plaintiff and one Panchavarnam D/O Marthamotho as a Joint Administrator on 7 March 2019 and taken out in the High Court of Malaya in Muar in the State of Johor Darul Takzim, Malaysia.”

After the proposed deletions, it would read:

> “The Plaintiff is the widow of the late ANA A/L BATUMALAI (“the Deceased”). The Plaintiff brings this action for the benefit of the Deceased’s dependants under the Civil Law Act (Cap. 43)”.

10     Untouched was para 9 of the SOC, which listed the particulars of the five persons “for whose benefit” the action had been brought, pursuant to s 20 of the CLA. The five persons were the appellant and her four minor children with the deceased. The children are aged eight to 17 as at 2022. The intent was to amend the writ and SOC such that the appellant was suing in her personal capacity as widow, and not as administrator.

## Issue on Appeal

11     The main issue in contention in this appeal, which had not been addressed when parties were before the DR, was whether the court could grant the appellant leave to amend the writ and SOC pursuant to O 20 r 5(4) of the Rules of Court 2014 (“**ROC 2014**”), given that the three-year time-bar under s 20(5) of the CLA took effect in July 2021, and if so, whether the amendments sought should be granted.

12     If I answered the question in the negative and did not grant the amendments sought, then the matter would end there, and the appeal would be dismissed. However, if I answered the question in the affirmative and granted the amendments sought, then a consequential question that arose was whether the appellant’s children would be included in the amended dependency claim by virtue of their having been named in para 9 of the SOC.

## The Law

13     The basic legal principles concerning the court’s power to allow amendments to the writ or pleadings were not disputed. O 20 r 5(1) of the ROC 2014 empowers a court to allow such amendments if they would allow the real question in controversy between the parties to be determined (see _Singapore Civil Procedure 2019_ at 20/8/8, and _The Virginia Rhea_ \[1983 – 1984\] SLR(R) 539 at \[5\]).

14     Under **O 20 r 5(2)** of the ROC 2014, the court may **grant leave for amendments** to a writ or pleadings under O 20 rr 5(3), 5(4) or 5(5) **even if the application is made after the expiry of the relevant limitation period**, assuming the **matter was within the limitation period at the date of the writ, if the court thinks it is just** to do so.

15     The applicable provision in this case is **O 20 r 5(4)** of the ROC 2014, which empowers the court to allow an amendment to **alter the capacity** in which a party **sues if the new capacity in which she will sue is one in which she might have sued as at the date of issue of the writ**. The rationale behind this is that “… if the proceedings had been, from the beginning, properly formulated or constituted in the circumstances specified in para (3), (4) and (5) the defence of limitation would not have been available to the defendant…”. In this scenario, the defects in the proceedings are treated as having been cured _ab initio_, and the defendant is not regarded as being a deprived of a defence as he would not have had it if the proceedings had been properly formulated in the first place (see _Lim Yong Swan v Lim Jee Tee_ <span class="citation">\[1992\] 3 SLR(R) 940</span> at \[27\] \[“**_Lim Yong Swan_**”\], citing the _Supreme Court Practice 1991_).

16     In _Lim Yong Swan_ at \[16\] to \[19\], the Court of Appeal analysed the scope of paras (3), (4) and (5) of O 20 r 5 of the ROC 2014, stating that an amendment pursuant to para (3) would be “a mere correction of the nomenclature with which the party is labelled”, while an amendment pursuant to para (4) was similar and would be “nominal”. The Court of Appeal concluded as follows:

> “What is common in all three paragraphs is this. For an application to come within any of the three paragraphs, **there must already be asserted in the writ or the pleadings a set of allegations which, in spite of the expiry of the limitation period**, reasonably identify the party suing or sued, which **is capable of conveying the capacity of the party to sue** or which permits the addition or substitution of another cause of action. **In other words, the matters of** identity, **capacity** or cause of action **are already asserted or implied, from the inception of the writ or the filing of the pleading and it is merely a matter of correction to make explicit what is implicit.”** (emphasis added)

17     It was not disputed that as at the date of the writ, the appellant had the personal capacity to pursue a dependency claim against the respondent in Singapore, but not the capacity as administrator to pursue an estate claim against the respondent in Singapore. The present action was also filed within the three-year limitation period. Based on the foregoing, the position would be as follows: although the limitation period had passed, the court _may_ allow the appellant to amend the capacity in which she was suing the respondent from the capacity of administrator to her personal capacity, _if this was already asserted in the writ or SOC, or implied therein, such that the amendments sought were merely to make explicit what was implicit_.

18     Beyond this, the parties’ views diverged. In particular, two questions arose. First was whether the effect of the case of _AXF and others v Koh Cheng Huat and another_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 819</span> (“**_AXF_**”) was that the three-year time-bar in s 20(5) of the CLA prevented this claim from being rescued. Second was the weight to be given to a series of English cases which had been decided before the English equivalent of our O 20 r 5 of the ROC 2014 was introduced.

### Appellant’s position

19     The appellant’s position was, simply, that the court should lean towards allowing an amendment instead of striking out a claim. Thus, the amendments sought should be allowed because the dependency claim had already been explicitly asserted in para 9 of the SOC, the dependants’ particulars had been provided thereunder as required by s 20(6) of the CLA, and para 11 of the SOC asserted that the five dependants were dependent on the deceased for financial support.

### Respondent’s position

#### Time-bar

20     The respondent submitted otherwise. In the Respondent’s Written Submissions (“**RWS**”),[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) Counsel for the respondent Mr Anthony Wee raised the case of _AXF_, in which the three plaintiffs had filed dependency claims under s 20 of the CLA against the defendants, more than six years after the relevant death. The High Court held (at \[39\]) that the time-bar set out in s 20(5) of the CLA was absolute and mandatory, such that the court did not have any powers to extend time or make any exceptions. Mr Wee thus submitted that this meant that any dependency claim brought by the Appellant or the children after 16 July 2021 would be time-barred. However, _AXF_ did not involve or address the interplay between s 20(5) of the CLA and O 20 r 5 of the ROC 2014. It was therefore not authority for the specific proposition that an amendment under O 20 r 5 of the ROC 2014 could not be granted because the period under s 20(5) of the CLA had expired.

21     In the Respondent’s Further Written Submissions (“**RFWS**”),[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) Mr Wee submitted that the time-bar in the CLA was absolute because it was not subject to any exceptions, unlike the time-bars in the Limitation Act 1959 (“**Limitation Act**”), which were subject to exceptions such as those under s 24 and s 24A of the Limitation Act. However, I did not find this to be a cogent reason as to why limitation periods in O 20 r 5(2) of the ROC 2014 should refer only to those in the Limitation Act for example, but not one referred to in the CLA. Thus, reading _AXF_ with O 20 rr 5(2) and 5(4) as well as _Lim Yong Swan_, my view was that _AXF_ did not bar the court from allowing an amendment to alter a party’s capacity, **if** the tests in O 20 rr 5(2) and 5(4) as well as _Lim Yong Swan_ were satisfied.

22     In the RFWS, Mr Wee also cited the case of _Government of Malaysia v Mohamed Amin bin Hassan_ <span class="citation">\[1986\] 1 MLJ 224</span> (“**_Mohamed Amin_**”), in support of his contention that this court’s power to allow an amendment to alter the appellant’s capacity in this suit is overridden by the time-bar. However, the plaintiff in that suit, who had initially filed a representative claim for wrongful death within the limitation period, had tried to **add himself and his wife as parties to the suit** after the time-bar. The Federal Court of Malaysia, by a majority decision, ruled that this could not be permitted. The reason was that the Malaysian Subordinate Courts Rules’ equivalent of O 20 r 5(4) of the ROC 2014 only allowed the alteration of the capacity in which a party sued, and not the addition of a party, which was what the plaintiff was seeking to do. As the case involved the addition of a capacity rather than an alteration of capacity, my view was that it was not authority for this particular contention. Its relevance arose on a separate point, which will be addressed later.

#### English cases

23     Next, there is a series of English cases involving actions filed by plaintiffs who were dependants of the deceased persons, and whose capacity to sue was called into question in circumstances involving time-bars. Mr Wee submitted that although these cases were decided before the English equivalent of O 20 r 5 of the ROC 2014 was introduced, this court could have regard to them to them for two main reasons. First was that the facts of one of these cases in particular was highly persuasive, as they were on all fours with the facts of the present case. Further, it is stated in _Singapore Civil Procedure 2021_ (“**White Book**”) that the principles enunciated in these cases continue to apply. Second was that these cases had been cited with approval by the Court of Appeal _in Teo Gim Tiong v Krishnasamy Pushpavathi (legal representative of the estate of Maran s/o Kannakasabai, deceased)_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 15</span> (“**_Teo Gim Tiong_**”). I considered these submissions in turn.

24     The three English cases that were raised were _Finnegan v Cementation Co Ltd_ \[1958\] QBD 688 (“**_Finnegan_**”), _Hilton v Sutton Steam Laundry_ <span class="citation">\[1945\] 1 KB 65</span> (“**_Hilton_**”) and _Stebbings v Holst & Co Ltd_ \[1953\] 1 WLR 608 (“**_Stebbings_**”). _Finnegan_ was the case which Mr Wee submitted had facts on all fours with the present one. The English statutes applicable in these cases were the Fatal Accidents Acts (“**FAAs**”) and the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934 (“**LRA**”). Money recovered under the FAAs would go to the dependants, while money recovered under the LRA would go to the estate. The relevant facts and outcomes of the three cases were as follows:

> (a)     In _Finnegan_ (see pages 693 – 694), the deceased’s widow had sued under the FAAs.

>> ·       In the title of the action, she sued as “widow and administratrix”.

>> ·       By the indorsement on the writ, her claim was as “administratrix”.

>> ·       In the SOC, she was stated to be the “widow and administratrix”, who brought the action “for the benefit of the dependants of the deceased under the Fatal Accidents Acts, 1846 – 1908, and for the benefit of the deceased’s estate.”

>> ·       The widow did not have capacity to bring the action in England as administratrix, because she had obtained LA only in Southern Ireland.

> The court found that as the indorsement on the writ clearly showed that the action was brought in her capacity as administratrix, and the SOC was not an extension nor modification of the indorsement, being merely descriptive of herself as widow and one entitled to the damages if she succeeded. The court thus upheld the decision to set aside the action as the widow did not have the requisite capacity. As the limitation period had passed by then, she had no remedy.

> (b)     In _Hilton_ (see pages 66, 68 – 73), the deceased’s widow had sued under the FAAs and LRA.

>> ·       On the face of the writ, she was described as “widow”.

>> ·       The indorsement on the writ was that she claimed as “administratrix … for damages for negligence and breach of statutory duty pursuant to the provisions of” the FAAs and LRA.

>> ·       In the SOC, she was stated to be the “widow … \[who\] brings this action as administratrix” under the LRA, and “for the benefit of herself the sole dependant of the deceased” under the FAAs.

>> ·       The widow had not obtained LA at the time the writ and SOC were issued.

> It was argued that in the SOC, the widow was claiming in her personal capacity and not her representative capacity. The court rejected this argument, finding that the claims in both the writ and the SOC were purported to be made in a representative capacity. The court held that as the writ was a nullity from its filing, a subsequent grant of LA could not validate it. Although the action could have been brought by the widow in her personal capacity with the same result, since the time-bar had passed in the meantime, the court found that she could not be allowed to amend her claim as this would deprive the defendant of its defence of limitation.

> (c)     In _Stebbings_ (see pages 605 – 607), the widow had sued under the FAAs and LRA.

>> ·       In the title of the action, she sued as “Widow and Administratrix”.

>> ·       In the indorsement to the writ, her claim was stated to be for damages under the FAAs and LRA “as Widow and Administratrix”.

>> ·       The widow had not been granted LA at the time the writ was issued, and later conceded that the writ was a nullity insofar as the LRA claim was concerned.

> The court rejected the argument that the plaintiff should be treated as having sued only as administratrix because to do so would ignore the clear mention of her as widow in the indorsement. In this regard, the court regarded the mention of the plaintiff as widow in the title of the action as merely descriptive of her personal status. To give full effect to the words in the indorsement, the court preferred to interpret the reference to the claim under the FAAs as being claims in the plaintiff’s capacity as widow, and the claim under the LRA as being in her capacity as administratrix. Since she had no capacity to sue as administratrix, the words “as administratrix” could be disregarded. The court’s view was that this would not deprive the defendants of the benefit of the defence of limitation, since the action had already been effectively begun by the plaintiff as widow. The court also distinguished _Hilton_ on the basis that the indorsement therein only proclaimed the plaintiff as administratrix.

25     In the White Book at 20/8/21, after _Lim Yong Swan_ is noted, the authors state, without preamble or further elaboration, that the “pre-1981 position” in the English line of cases such as _Finnegan_ and _Hilton_ continues to apply in Singapore. Mr Wee submitted that this supported his argument for this court to follow the outcome in those cases. However, it appeared that this was a reference to the amendments made to the English Rules of Supreme Court in 1981 (“**the 1981 amendments**”), which extended the equivalent of O 20 r 5(4) of the ROC 2014 to allow a party to amend the capacity in which he sued even if he acquired that capacity only **after** the date of commencement of the proceedings – see _Singapore Court Practice 2017_ at 20/5/16. If so, the current English law would be different from Singapore law, as O 20 r 5(4) of our ROC 2014 still requires the applicant to have had the relevant capacity to sue at the date of commencement of the proceedings, before the amendment to alter her capacity can be allowed. If that was the context in which the comment in the White Book was made, then it did not assist the respondent, since the appellant in the present case had the relevant capacity to sue at all material times.

26     I also found that _Teo Gim Tiong_ did not assist the respondent, because that case concerned only the capacity of the plaintiff to act on the deceased’s behalf as administrator in a lawsuit when LA had not yet been granted to her. It was in that context that the Court of Appeal noted the English cases and agreed (at \[30\]) that without the requisite capacity as administrator, a plaintiff could not bring or continue an action on behalf of the deceased. This point, on the lack of capacity as administrator, had already been conceded in the present case, hence the application to amend the capacity in which the appellant was bringing the action. The action in _Teo Gim Tiong_ was not a dependency claim (see _Teo Gim Tiong_ at \[10\]), and the issue of the plaintiff’s ability to sue in her personal capacity was thus not dealt with.

27     The present action was brought under the CLA, which has provisions similar to those in the FAAs in question in the English cases. In the present case:

> ·    In the title of the original writ and SOC, the appellant was named only as administrator.

> ·    There was no indorsement to the writ, as it referred only to the SOC.

> ·    In the SOC, although the appellant was described as the deceased’s widow and administrator, the action was stated to be brought “for the benefit of the Deceased’s Estate and for the benefit of the Deceased’s dependants under the Civil Law Act”.

My initial view had been that the basic facts were more similar to those in _Hilton_. Even if I was wrong on this point and the present facts were closer to those in _Finnegan_, this did not quite matter, given that these cases were decided when the operative provision for granting amendments to pleadings were different. They thus carried limited weight in any event.

28     Further, if plaintiffs in the _Finnegan_ and _Hilton_ scenarios still could not be allowed in principle to ever alter the capacity in which they sued even with a provision such as O 20 r 5(4) of the ROC 2014, then it had to be asked: in what sorts of scenarios would this provision apply at all? This question was posed to parties,[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4) and Mr Wee contended in the RFWS[^5] that only in a case where the alteration was intended to correct a misdescription of a party, without adding an additional capacity, would this be allowed. Thus, it was only in cases such as _Stebbings_, and the Malaysian case of _Tan Yok Fong (Administratrix of the estate of Hwang Chuan Seng, decd) v Khoo Ban Kok & anor_ \[1994\] 3 MLJ 70 (“**_Tan Yok Fong_**”), in which the amendment would be allowed.

29     The facts of _Stebbings_ have been noted above, and it was clear all along that the plaintiff therein intended to sue in both her capacity as widow and administratrix. The plaintiff therein also did not require the 1981 amendments to be given relief, so it did not aid the respondent to say that facts such as those would fall within the operation of O 20 r 5(4) of the ROC 2014.

30     As for _Tan Yok Fong_, the plaintiff therein sued as administrator of her late husband’s estate when she intended all along to pursue a dependency claim. Any description of her as an administrator was thus considered to be a misdescription, and since she could have sued for dependency from the beginning and the relief claimed was no different from the one already claimed, the amendment was allowed. Crucially, there was no issue of a time-bar in that case, and I therefore did not regard it as substantially assisting the respondent.

31     To reiterate, it was stated in _Lim Yong Swan_ at \[19\] that O 20 r 5 of the ROC 2014 applied if “the matters of identity, capacity or cause of action are already asserted or **implied**, from the inception of the writ or the filing of the pleading and it is merely a matter of correction to make explicit what is **implicit**.” (emphasis added) The Court of Appeal did not require that the capacity must have been one that was already expressly mentioned; it was sufficient if it was implied. The Court of Appeal also did not state that the power under O 20 r 5(4) of the ROC 2014 was limited to correcting misdescriptions in the capacity of a party; corrections of errors were stated in reference to the power under O 20 r 5(3) of the ROC 2014.

32     To sum up this point, given that _Finnegan_ and _Hilton_ were decided before the equivalent of O 20 r 5(4) of the ROC 2014 was introduced in England, and no case law was cited which clearly stated that these positions had to continue to apply, I was unable to see why this court could not allow an amendment to alter the widow’s capacity, if the tests in O 20 rr 5(2) and 5(4) as well as _Lim Yong Swan_ were satisfied.

## My Decision

### Main issue

33     Applying the relevant legal tests to the present facts, the main issue turned on two questions. First, whether there were already allegations asserted or implied from inception in the writ or SOC which were capable of conveying the appellant’s capacity to sue as widow, such that the amendments sought were merely a matter of nominal correction to make explicit what was implicit. Second, if so, whether allowing the amendment was a just outcome.

34     The writ afforded no assistance to the appellant on this point, as she was clearly named only as administrator, and there was no indorsement to the writ.

35     As for the SOC, it stated in para 1 that the appellant was a widow. However, in context, it was a statement of her personal status, rather than an assertion of the capacity in which she was suing. This was because the two sentences that followed clearly referred to representative claims: The first was that she was bringing the action on behalf of the deceased’s estate and on behalf of the deceased’s dependants, while the second referred to the grant of LA which she and the other joint administrator received in a Malaysian court. It was clear that there was no express assertion in the SOC that the appellant was making any claim in her personal capacity.

36     However, there were clearly allegations made in the SOC which were **capable of conveying** the appellant’s ability to bring a claim in her personal capacity as widow. These were the abovementioned statement of her personal status in para 1 of the SOC, and her being named in para 9 of the SOC as the lawful wife and one of the dependants for whose benefit the action was being brought. Para 11 of the SOC also asserted the appellant’s dependency on the deceased for financial support. My view was therefore that **there were sufficient facts asserted in the SOC to expressly convey the appellant’s capacity to bring a dependency claim, and to imply her dependency claim**. Thus, allowing amendments for the appellant to sue in her personal capacity were not the addition of a capacity, such as that in the case of _Mohamed Amin_, but the **alteration** or substitution of a capacity.

37     Given that the consequential amendments to the writ and SOC were primarily deletions rather than substantial additions of text, and no additional reliefs were being pursued which had not already been claimed in the initial SOC, I was of the view that the amendments were sufficiently nominal that they satisfied the _Lim Yong Swan_ test.

38     As to the question of whether allowing these amendments would be just, I assessed this from both parties’ viewpoints. From the appellant’s viewpoint, it would be just since it would prevent her claim from being lost on a technicality when the respondent had already admitted 100% liability for causing the deceased’s death. From the respondent’s viewpoint, he would not be able to avail himself of the defence of limitation, and this prejudice could not be cured by an award of costs. However, as noted above (at \[15\]), in the case of an amendment such as the present one, the response to the defendant was that he was not being deprived of a defence as he would not have had it if the claim had been properly formulated in the first place.

39     On balance, my view was that it would be just to allow the amendments sought by the appellant, to alter her capacity from that of an administrator to that of her personal capacity as widow of the deceased.

### Consequential question

40     However, this did not end the matter, because it gave rise to the consequential question of whether the appellant’s children would be included in the amended dependency claim by virtue of them having been named in para 9 of the SOC. Mr Chong submitted that it was sufficient for the children to have been named in para 9 of the SOC, as required under s 20(6) of the CLA. Mr Wee submitted otherwise.

41     S 20 of the CLA concerns the right of action for wrongful acts causing death. S 20(1) specifies that where a death has been caused by a wrongful act and the person injured would have been able to sue a defendant for that wrongful act but for his death, then notwithstanding the deceased’s death, the defendant shall be liable to an action for damages_._ The subsequent sub-sections read as follows:

> “(2)  Subject to section 21(2), every such action shall be for the benefit of the dependants of the … deceased.

> (3)    Every action brought under this section shall be brought by and in the name of the executor or administrator of the deceased.

> (4)    If –

>> (a)    there is no executor or administrator of the deceased; or

>> (b)    no action is brought within 6 months after the death by and in the name of an executor or administrator of the deceased,

> the **action may be brought by and in the name of all or any of the persons for whose benefit an** executor or **administrator could have brought it**.

> (5)    Not more than one action shall lie for or in respect of the same subject-matter of complaint and every such action shall be brought within 3 years after the death of such deceased person.

> (6)    The plaintiff in every such action brought under this section shall be required to deliver to the defendant or his solicitor full particulars of the persons for whom and on whose behalf the action is brought and of the nature of the claim in respect of which damages are sought to be recovered.” (emphasis added)

42     It was clear from s 20(4) of the CLA that where no action was brought by the administrator, then one may be brought “**by and in the name of** any of the persons for whose benefit” an administrator could have brought it. This plainly meant that any dependants who wished to claim relief against the respondent **must be named as parties to the action**. That all dependants are ordinarily named as plaintiffs in representative actions can also be seen from cases such as _AXF_, and in the recommended forms for pleadings for particulars of claim for damages for bereavement and loss of dependency, compared to the forms for particulars of claim for damages by administrators or executors in _Atkin’s Encyclopaedia of Court Forms in Civil Proceedings_ (2nd Edition, 2019 issue, Volume 31(2), Part I, Forms 106 – 108).

43     Applying this to the present case, it meant that it would be insufficient for the appellant’s children to be merely listed as dependants in the SOC as persons on whose behalf or benefit the action was brought, since it would no longer be a representative action after amendment.

44     This would create an awkward result. The children were not named in any capacity as parties to the action, which meant that adding them as plaintiffs would go beyond the scope of merely _correcting_ the name of a party under O 20 r 5(3) of the ROC 2014 or _altering the capacity_ of a party under O 20 r 5(4) of the ROC 2014. It could be argued that the children’s claim for dependency was clear from the original SOC and it would not cause the respondent further hardship or prejudice to add them as parties. In Mr Chong’s words, there was “no fresh claim as such.” However, the fact that the court was not expressly empowered to allow the addition of parties when limitation was in issue was not the only difficulty.

45     As Mr Wee correctly pointed out in the RWS,[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) the children, being minors, are under a disability, and may not bring or make a claim except by their litigation representative – see O 76 r 2 of the ROC 2014. If so, the writ and SOC cannot in any event be amended to add them as parties until such time as their litigation representative is appointed. This would be the case even _if_ s 24 of the CLA _might_ apply to extend the limitation period in view of the children’s disability such that the time-bar is not an issue for them. However, further consequential problems might arise then. For example, could the current writ and SOC then be amended to add them as parties, or would they need to file a separate suit? If they need to file a separate suit, the difficulty would then be that s 20(5) of the CLA states that only one such action for wrongful death can be brought, so the appellant may then need to elect to proceed only with her own suit, or withdraw her suit and proceed on one in only the children’s names. Nevertheless, these were not issues that were before me, and they were matters which parties and counsel would need to consider. I therefore made no further comment on them.

## Conclusion on Substantive Appeal

46     To summarise my decision on the substantive appeal, the order made by the DR that the plaintiff’s claim be struck-out was reversed. I allowed the deletions and additions of text set out in the draft amended SOC that was filed on 1 August 2022. However, since my view was that these amendments did not rescue the children’s dependency claim, this meant that I allowed the appeal only in part, insofar as it was based on the third ground of appeal, and only insofar as the appellant could pursue a personal claim for dependency.

47     For completeness, my view was that retaining the children’s names in para 9 of the SOC served no purpose, since I found that they needed to be added as parties if they wished to sustain their dependency claim. Their names therefore ought to be deleted from para 9 of the SOC. However, since that was not a specific request before me, and parties needed to consider their follow-up actions on my decision, I made no order thereon.

## Costs

48     There were three sets of costs to be dealt with at the conclusion of the RA. First, the costs of the action fixed by the DR at $7,500, with reasonable disbursements to be taxed if not agreed, and applicable GST. Second, the costs of the application for striking out fixed by the DR at $4,000, with reasonable disbursements to be taxed if not agreed, and applicable GST. These two sets of costs had been ordered to be paid by the appellant’s solicitors to the respondent, on the ground that the estate claim had effectively been filed without authority, since the appellant did not have the capacity to sue as administrator.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7) Third, there were the costs of the RA. After hearing parties’ submissions thereon, I made the following orders.

### Costs of the action

49     In respect of the costs of the action, the DR’s award was made on the basis that the claim had been struck out in its entirety. Now that a part of the claim had been saved, but the estate claim remained struck out, it was appropriate to vary that costs order downwards. Parties agreed that the disbursements could be fixed, insofar as the disbursements incurred up to that point were in relation to filing the Defence. In this regard, Mr Chong agreed with Mr Wee that even if these costs orders were revised in view of the outcome of the RA, they should remain payable by the appellant’s solicitors.

50     Having considered the nature of the claim that was struck out and what remained, I revised the DR’s order on costs of the action to $4,000, with disbursements at $200. The costs and disbursements were ordered to be paid by the appellant’s solicitors to the respondent.

### Costs of the application for striking out

51     In respect of the costs of the application for striking out, these had been fixed by the DR at $4,000, with disbursements to be taxed if not agreed, and applicable GST. Once again, that order had been premised on the respondent successfully striking out the claim in its entirety. Now that a part of the claim was saved, it was also appropriate to vary that costs order. Parties agreed that the costs order might be halved, to $2,000. Mr Chong also agreed that the costs should remain payable by the appellant’s solicitors.

52     My view was that since the bulk of the work in that application concerned the estate claim, which remained struck out, the costs order should not be halved, but should be reduced by a smaller proportion. I thus ordered that the costs of that application be varied to $3,000 (all-in), payable by the appellant’s solicitors to the respondent.

### Costs of the Registrar’s Appeal

53     Finally, in respect of the RA, Mr Chong submitted that as costs followed the event, costs should be awarded to the appellant. He nevertheless acknowledged that since the matter resulted in the appellant being allowed to amend her writ and SOC, costs of amending the pleadings could be awarded to the respondent or defence. Mr Wee pointed out that the respondent had effectively succeeded on two out of three grounds of appeal, since the appellant withdrew the first two grounds of appeal. Work also had been done by the respondent in addressing those grounds in the RWS, before they were conceded by Mr Chong on the day the RA was first fixed to be heard. Mr Wee also submitted that since the appeal was effectively the appellant’s request for leave to amend her pleading, costs should be paid by her. Mr Wee nevertheless noted that these costs would not be payable by the appellant’s solicitors, but by the appellant. Given her personal circumstances and difficulties, Mr Wee left the amount of the costs award to the court.

54     I noted that two out of three grounds of appeal were abandoned by the appellant, and that work had been done by the respondent on those grounds in the RWS. Further, although the appeal had been allowed on the third ground, it was only allowed in part. I agreed with Mr Wee that it also effectively involved the appellant seeking leave to amend her pleading, and in such cases, the party that is granted leave to amend ordinarily bears the costs. On balance, my view was that a net award of costs should be made in the respondent’s favour. I therefore awarded costs of $2,000 (all in) to the respondent.

55     In closing, I record my appreciation to the solicitors for the respondent for the extensive research done and submissions tendered, which aided in crystallising my thoughts, even if I did not agree with their submissions in their entirety.
