Criminal Law and Sentencing – Workplace Safety and Health Act

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9823/2020/01 and MA 9825/2020/01.\]

8 October 2020

### District Judge Luke Tan:

## Introduction

1       Two accused persons, Tan Wee Meng (“Tan”), a Workplace Safety and Health Officer (“WSHO”), and Lee Chung Ling (“Lee”), a Project Manager (“PM”), were persons-at-work at a construction worksite located at MK31-04596M along Airport Boulevard, Changi Airport, Singapore 239732. This worksite was a workplace within the meaning of the Workplace Safety and Health Act (Chapter 354A, 2009 Rev Ed) (“WSHA”).

2       Each accused person was charged with committing an offence under s 15(3A) of the WSHA, by committing negligent acts without reasonable cause, which acts endangered the safety of workers who were constructing a high-tension cable conduit at the workplace. Their charges were originally fixed for a joint trial. However, after a review of the case, they pleaded guilty before the trial commenced.

3       Tan’s charge stated that from October 2016 to 22 March 2017, he had failed to:

> (i)     assist the occupier of the workplace to identify and assess any foreseeable risk arising from the formwork construction methods used to construct the high-tension cable conduit at HT0002 and HT0003, and

> (ii)     recommend to the occupier of the workplace reasonably practicable measures to eliminate any foreseeable risk to any person who is at work in that workplace by failing to conduct risk assessments and safe work procedures for the use of metal module formwork at the workplace;

> which endangered the safety of the workers constructing formworks for high tension cable conduit.

4       As for Lee, his charge stated that from October 2016 to 22 March 2017, he had failed to:

> (i)     review the work method and processes for the formwork construction for the high-tension cable conduit at HT0002 and HT0003;

> (ii)     ensure Chan & Chan appointed a formwork supervisor for formwork activities at the workplace;

> (iii)     approve risk assessments and safe work procedures for the use of metal module formwork at the workplace; and

> (iv)     ensure that the control measures in the risk assessment for the works were implemented, specifically for the formwork activities within the workplace;

which endangered the safety of the workers constructing formworks for high tension cable conduit.

5       The prescribed punishable for each charge is a fine not exceeding $30,000, or imprisonment not exceeding two years or both.

6       The Prosecution sought custodial sentences of 2 months’ imprisonment for Tan, and 3 months’ imprisonment for Lee. The same Defence Counsel who represented both accused persons, submitted that a fine of S$15,000 to S$30,000 for Lee and Tan would be fair and just. Both the Prosecution and the Defence tendered lengthy and detailed documents to back up their respective positions.

7       Having considered the facts admitted to by the accused persons, as well as the detailed submissions of parties, and also having considered the clear guidance set out by the High Court in _Mao Xuezhong v PP and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 99</span> (“_Mao Xuezhong_”), I agreed with the Prosecution’s suggested sentencing position. Accordingly, I sentenced Tan to 2 months’ imprisonment, and Lee to 3 months’ imprisonment.

8       The accused persons, being dissatisfied, have each filed an appeal against his sentence. I now give my reasons for my decisions on sentence.

## Statement of Facts

9       The Prosecution submitted two lengthy Statement of Facts (SOFs), one for each accused person. Both SOFs contained many common features, and both accused persons admitted to their respective SOFs without qualification. I summarise below the main features of the SOFs that they admitted to, with some parts of the summary underlined for emphasis.

### Background and Accident

10     Changi Airport Group (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. (“CAG”) awarded a construction contract to Chan & Chan Engineering Pte. Ltd. (“Chan & Chan”) at the workplace at MK31-04596M along Airport Boulevard, Changi Airport, Singapore 239732. Chan & Chan was therefore the registered occupier and employer at the workplace.

11     In relation to a workplace accident that took place on 22 March 2017 at the worksite, Chan & Chan was charged for an offence under section 12(1) WSHA. Chan & Chan pleaded guilty to the charge and was convicted and sentenced to a fine of $150,000 on 13 September 2018.

12     In respect to the above accident, one of the construction workers hired by Chan & Chan, Miah Salim (“the Deceased”), was involved. The Deceased, a Bangladeshi National, had been employed since 15 January 2013 to perform construction works, and was deployed to the workplace in January 2017.

13     On 22 March 2017, at about 10.50am, the accident happened at the worksite. At that time, the Deceased was the leader of a group of six workers who were involved in the construction of the cable conduit.

14     The Deceased was inside an excavation pit and erecting the formwork for the construction of the high-tension cable conduit at that time. He was using a hammer to adjust a wooden horizontal prop that was used to support two steel plates (which served as the formwork for the construction of the cable conduit), when the wooden prop slipped, resulting in one of the steel plates falling inwards and hitting onto the Deceased’s chest. The Deceased succumbed to the resulting injuries and passed away at Changi General Hospital. The cause of death was certified as “Blunt Force Trauma to Chest and Abdomen”

### Tan’s role, duties and training

15     At the material time, Tan was the workplace safety and health officer _(_WSHO) for the workplace, and has been since May 2016. Under Reg 9(1) of the WSH (WSHO) Regulations, the duties of a WSHO in respect of a workplace were as follows:

> The duties of a workplace safety and health officer appointed in respect of a workplace shall be —

>> a)    to assist the occupier of the workplace or other person in charge of the workplace to identify and assess any foreseeable risk arising from the workplace or work processes therein;

>> b)    to recommend to the occupier of the workplace or other person in charge of the workplace reasonably practicable measures to eliminate any foreseeable risk to any person who is at work in that workplace or may be affected by the occupier’s undertaking in the workplace;

>> c)    where it is not reasonably practicable to eliminate the risk referred to in subparagraph (b), to recommend to the occupier of the workplace or other person in charge of the workplace —

>>> (i)    such reasonably practicable measures to minimise the risk; and

>>> (ii)   such safe work procedures to control the risk; and

> d)    to assist the occupier of the workplace or other person in charge of the workplace to implement the measure or safe work procedure referred to in sub-paragraph (b) or (c), as the case may be.

16     Under Chan & Chan’s Safety Management System (“SMS”), Tan’s responsibilities were as follows:

> (a)     Undergo Safety Officer’s Training Course and possess valid certificate and also registered with the Ministry of Manpower as a Workplace Safety and Health Officer.

> (b)     Discharge his duties as stated in the Workplace Safety and Health Act 2006.

> (c)     Implement and maintain proper procedures as stipulated in the safety, health, environment and security manual including administrative and recording system.

> (d)     Generate the required level of participation in safety, health and environment through safety, health and environment enhancement and promotional activities.

> (e)     Act as secretary to the committee and provide guidance to the members in carrying out their safety and health ensuring duties.

> (h)     Assess the safety, health and environment performance rating of all foremen and sub-contractors.

17     Tan had attended the WSHO course, Work-at-Height Assessor Course, Confine Space Assessor Course, First Aid Officer Course and Environmental Control Officer Course, prior to the accident.

### Lee’s roles, duties and training

18     Lee was employed by Chan & Chan as a Project Director to oversee construction projects. He has been with Chan & Chan since 01 April 2012. At the material time, Lee was the appointed Project Manager (PM) of the workplace. The PM is the person who is stationed at a worksite and who has overall control of all the works carried out in the worksite. As a PM of the workplace, Lee was responsible for making the final decision on changes in work methods and processes.

19     Under Chan & Chan’s Safety Management System, Lee’s role as PM includes the following:

> a.     In charge of Safety and Health at the Site.

> b.     Undergo Project Manager’s Safety Course and possess valid certificate (if applicable).

> c.     Familiarise himself with the Company’s safety, health and environment management system and ensure its effective application

> d.      Take prompt corrective actions to remove any unsafe or unhealthy work conditions and to maintain effectively such corrections made.

> e.     Ensure good housekeeping is practiced on site.

> f.      Ensure that environmental, health and safety is planned unto all operations.

> g.      Review all working methods and process, both new and existing to ensure that all environmental, health and safety aspects are met.

> h.     Act as Chairman to the site safety, health and environment committee and conduct monthly site committee inspection and meeting.

> i.     Participate in all incident investigation and dangerous occurrences incidents.

20     Lee has attended the ‘Safety for Project Manager Course’ and ‘Risk Management’ course prior to the accident. He was a person at work for the purposes of the WSHA.

### Brief facts about the accident

21     The high-tension cable conduit to be constructed for this project measured about 0.9m (width) by 0.9m (height) and stretched about 200m along Airport Boulevard. The conduit has been casted except for a length of 24m that was between manholes HT0002 and HT0003. The high-tension cable conduit was to be constructed in the excavation pit in four sections. The excavation pit measured about 1.3m wide and 1.5m deep. The accident occurred at the 2nd section within the pit.

22     To construct the high-tension cable conduit, a formwork[^1] must first be constructed. The formwork for each section of the high-tension cable conduit was constructed using 2 steel plates placed vertically along their lengths and held in place with props. Each steel plate measured about 6m (length) by 1.5m (height) by 20mm (thickness) and weighed about 1 ton. The steel plate that fell onto the Deceased was in the 2nd section of the excavation pit.

23     On 22 March 2017, prior to work commencement, Lim Lai Geok, the Site Supervisor had conducted a toolbox meeting for the workers. After the meeting, the Deceased and his group of co-workers were tasked to cast the lean concrete within the excavation pit for the base of the high-tension cable conduit. Thereafter, the workers would construct the formwork for the remaining 24m length of the high-tension cable conduit to connect with the completed length of conduit.

24     In the course of constructing the framework, the Deceased and a colleague of his, one Islam, were inside the excavation pit to receive the steel plates. They had installed the horizontal props to hold the steel plates in position at the 1st section, and were reportedly installing the wooden props at the 2nd section when the accident occurred. Specifically, during the securing of the wooden prop, it slipped and the two horizontal props (GI pipes) fell off, resulting in the plate falling inwards and hitting the Deceased, firstly on his hand, and then on his chest. The Deceased was conveyed to Changi General Hospital but succumbed to his injuries.

25     The works, which were ongoing at the time of the accident, involved excavation works and works within an excavation pit. There was no formwork supervisor present at the accident area to supervise the formwork activities.

### Brief facts about the construction of the high tension cable conduit

26     The work activity at the time of the accident was the construction of formwork for high-tension cable conduit.

> (i)      The only method for constructing the formwork for the conduit in the risk assessment documents was the use of the conventional formwork (timber). This was reflected in the risk assessment document dated 01 June 2016.

> (ii)      However, at the workplace, the method for constructing the formwork for the conduit that was commonly used was the metal module formwork. Chan & Chan, through Lee, had approved the use of both the timber formworks and metal module formworks. Tan was aware of the use of both these methods for constructing formworks.

> (iii)      The workers had been instructed to use metal module formwork to construct the conduit at the workplace for several weeks before the accident. The work activity for constructing the conduit using the metal module formwork was not considered in the risk assessment documents. There was also no documented procedure for the use of the metal module formwork.

27     The workers used the metal module formwork until the section between HT0002 and HT0003. Due to the space constraint at this location, they were not able to use the metal module formwork. Investigations revealed that there were no specific work processes for constructing the formwork at this area.

28     Upon the Deceased’s instructions for constructing the formwork at this area, the workers started using steel plates. There was no documented procedure for the use of the steel plates, and such use of the steel plates for formwork is unsafe. None of the workers, including the Deceased, was trained to be a formwork supervisor (for the purposes of the Workplace Safety and Health (Construction) Regulations 2007.

### Risk Assessment, Safe Work Procedure and Site Management

29     There was a Risk Assessment (RA) done for the project dated 01 June 2016. This was submitted to CAG prior to the commencement of the project. The risk assessment was conducted by Tan and approved by Lee. At the workplace, there was a safe work procedure for the erection of conventional formwork. However, there were no method statement or safe work procedure for the construction of high-tension cable conduit using the metal module formwork.

30     On 24 June 2016, high tension live cables detection was conducted to determine the possible locations of the cables. Trial trenching was then performed in October 2016 to verify the actual location of the live cables at HT0002 and HT0003. Lee and Tan knew of the actual location of the existing live cables in October 2016 and that the excavation width between HT0002 and HT0003 was limited by the live cables.

31      Lee explained that it was not possible to use the metal module formworks at this location as there was a space limitation due to the existing live high tension cables. The workers would not be able to adjust the metal formwork and put the propping as there was not enough space due to the existing live cable at this location.

### Particulars of Tan’s negligent act

32     As set out in his charge, Tan committed a negligent act, which endangered the safety of workers constructing the high tension cable conduit as he failed to:

> (i)     assist the occupier of the workplace to identify and assess any foreseeable risk arising from the formwork construction methods used to construct the high-tension cable conduit at HT0002 and HT0003; and

> (ii)     recommend to the occupier of the workplace reasonably practicable measures to eliminate any foreseeable risk to any person who is at work in that workplace by failing to conduct risk assessments and safe work procedures for the use of metal module formwork at the workplace.

33      _1st particular of negligence_: Tan failed to assist the occupier of the workplace to identify and assess any foreseeable risk arising from the formwork construction methods used to construct the high-tension cable conduit at HT0002 and HT0003 as follows:

> (i)      Tan, as the WSHO, conducted site safety inspections, including at the work area where the accident occurred.

> (ii)     He failed to notice that the workers in the Deceased’s team were deploying an unsafe and unauthorized method of constructing the formwork with steel plates, and hence failed to assist Chan & Chan to identify and assess the foreseeable risk of using the steel plates as formworks at the accident area.

34      _2nd particular of negligence_: Tan failed to recommend to the occupier of the workplace reasonably practicable measures to eliminate any foreseeable risk to any person who is at work in that workplace by failing to conduct risk assessments and safe work procedures for the use of metal module formwork at the workplace:

> (i)     Tan was the person deployed by Chan & Chan to carry out the risk assessments and safe work procedures for the works that were being carried out at the workplace. He was also the person in-charge of the safety documents in the workplace.

> (ii)     Among the reasonably practicable measures to eliminate any foreseeable risk to any person who is at work in that workplace, is to have a safe work procedure and risk assessment, and to ensure that these are implemented at the workplace. For the risk assessment, this involves implementing the control measures stated within the risk assessment.

> (iii)     According to Workplace Safety and Health (Risk Management) Regulations, WSH Risk Management 3(1), Chan and Chan must conduct a risk assessment in relation to the safety and health risks posed to any person who may be affected by his undertaking in the workplace. Tan was given the responsibility as WSHO for doing this.

> (iv)     The Code of Practice on WSH Risk Management (Paragraph 6.1 General Requirements page 13) at Paragraph 6.1.2 also states that all identified hazards from work activities and sub-activities need to be evaluated for their associated risks and addressed using relevant risk controls. These steps and their results must be recorded in the risk assessment form.

> (v)     Tan was the person deployed by Chan & Chan to carry out the risk assessments and safe work procedures for the works that were being carried out at the workplace. He was also the person in-charge of the safety documents in the workplace.

> (vi)     Tan conducted the risk assessment dated 01 June 2016 for the works. Within the risk assessment, the only formwork activity, considered and assessed for safety, was the conventional timber formwork. Chan & Chan did not have a risk assessment, safe work procedure or a method statement for the use of a metal module formwork which was used to construct the high tension cable conduit.

> (vii)      Tan failed to recommend to Chan & Chan to have a risk assessment for the use of metal module formwork for constructing the high tension cable conduit. He also failed to recommend to Chan & Chan to implement the control measures in the risk assessment.

> (viii)    For the work activity for “Formwork”, the hazards identified were in relation to conventional formwork (using timber), i.e. cutting plywood for formwork, joining of plywood to make desired sized formwork, and erecting the formwork. The control measures for collapse of formwork included formwork design to be calculated and endorsed by a Professional Engineer (PE). The construction of the formwork must be supervised by formwork supervisor, and the inspection of the formwork must be carried out daily. A PE must supervise and issue a certificate upon completion of the formwork. There was no PE design for the formworks nor a formwork supervisor present at the worksite.

> (ix)      In addition, Tan failed to advise Chan & Chan to develop a method statement or safe work procedures for the construction of high tension cable conduit using the metal module formwork. He also failed to recommend to Chan & Chan to deploy a formwork supervisor for the formwork construction works as required in the risk assessment that he prepared.

> (x)     The WSH Construction Regulations require the appointment of formwork supervisor for formwork activities. Reg 60(1) provides that it shall be the duty of (a) the employer of any person who carries out any work involving the construction, erection, alteration or dismantling of a formwork structure in a worksite; or …. to comply with paragraphs (2), (3) and (4). Reg 60(3) requires that no person shall be appointed as a formwork supervisor in a worksite unless he has received adequate safety and health training to familiarise him with the hazards associated with the construction, erection, alteration or dismantling of the formwork structure and the precautions to be observed. Reg 60(4) states that no formwork structure shall be constructed, erected, altered or dismantled in a worksite except under the immediate supervision of a formwork supervisor.

> (xi)     Chan & Chan had the duty to appoint a formwork supervisor for the works carried out at the time of accident. The duties of a formwork supervisor include (a) to take, so far as is reasonably practicable, such measures as are necessary to ensure that during the erection of a formwork structure in a worksite, all the components of the formwork structure are properly erected, seated, connected, braced and tied so as to maintain its position and shape; (b) to make an inspection of the formwork structure upon the completion of the formwork structure to ensure that the formwork structure is in accordance with the design and drawings for that formwork structure; and (c) to immediately notify the occupier of the worksite upon discovering any unsafe condition during any inspection made under paragraph (b).

> (xii)      Whilst the risk assessment that Tan had prepared, provided for the appointment of a formwork supervisor, there was no formwork supervisor actually appointed. Tan had failed to advise Chan & Chan to appoint the required formwork supervisor to comply with the WSH Regulations and the risk assessment that he conducted.

### Particulars of Lee’s negligent act

35     As set out in his charge, Lee committed a negligent act, which endangered the safety of workers constructing the high tension cable conduit as he failed to:

> (i)     review the work method and processes for the formwork construction for the high tension cable conduit at HT0002 and HT0003;

> (ii)     ensure Chan & Chan appointed a formwork supervisor for formwork activities at the workplace;

> (iii)     approve risk assessments and safe work procedures for the use of metal module formwork at the workplace; and

> (iv)     ensure that the control measures in the risk assessment for the works were implemented, specifically for the formwork activities within the workplace.

36      _1st particular of negligence_: Lee’s failure to review the work method and processes for the formwork construction for the high tension cable conduit at HT0002 and HT0003:

> (i)      Lee’s duties as PM, as stated in Chan & Chan’s Safety Management System, was to review all working methods and process, both new and existing to ensure that all environmental, health and safety aspects are met. In this case, Lee was aware of the presence of live cables and that the work area between HT0002 and HT0003 would be constricted.

> (ii)     However, he failed to review the working methods and processes of constructing the formworks for the cable conduit at HT0002 and HT0003, considering the limited space and presence of live cables, to ensure that all environmental, health and safety aspects were met.

> (iii)      As the person who was stationed at a worksite and who has overall control of all the works carried out in the worksite, Lee failed to notice that the workers in the Deceased’s team were deploying an unsafe and unauthorized method of constructing the formwork, at HT0002 and HT0003, which was the use of the steel plates as formworks.

37      _2nd particular of negligence_: Lee’s failure to ensure that Chan & Chan appointed a formwork supervisor for formwork activities at the workplace:

> (i)     The WSH Construction Regulations requires the appointment of a formwork supervisor for formwork activities. Chan & Chan had the duty to appoint a formwork supervisor for the works carried out at the time of accident. As the person who was stationed at a worksite and who has overall control of all the works carried out in the worksite, Lee had failed to ensure that this was done.

> (ii)      Whilst the risk assessment document approved by Lee dated 01 June 2016, provided for the appointment of a formwork supervisor, there was no formwork supervisor appointed.

38      _3rd particular of negligence_: Lee’s failure to approve risk assessments and safe work procedures for the use of metal module formwork at the workplace:

> (i)     Lee approved the risk assessment for the works dated 01 June 2016. Within that risk assessment, the only formwork activity considered and assessed for safety was the conventional timber formwork.

> (ii)     However, at the workplace, prior to the accident, the workers were using the metal module formwork. There was no risk assessment and safe work procedures for the use of the metal module formwork. As the person approving the risk assessment and safe work procedures, Lee failed to ensure that the risk assessment and safe work procedures for the use of the metal module formwork were prepared and approved.

> (iii)     The Code of Practice on Workplace Safety and Health Risk Management (“COP Risk Management”), provides under Clause 5.3 that a manager who oversees the area, function or activity where WSH risks exist shall:

>> a)       Ensure that risk assessment is carried out and risk control measures are implemented before any new work is carried out in the manager’s area.

>> b)       Approve the risk assessment conducted for the manager’s area. The manager should also ensure that the risk level is not rated “High Risk” when approving works to be carried out.

>> c)       Ensure that the risk control measures are implemented without delay.

>> d)       Ensure that, where applicable, all operations have established safe work procedures.

>> e)       Ensure all persons exposed to the risks are informed of:

>>> \-       The nature of risks

>>> \-       Any measures or safe work procedures implemented; and

>>> \-       The means to minimise or eliminate the risks.

>> f)       Ensure that the effectiveness of the risk control measures are monitored.

>> g)       Revise the risk assessment if the risk control is inadequate and ineffective after the implementation.

>> h)       Maintain risk assessment documentation with measures and safe work procedures implemented.

>> i)       Assist the Employer to implement the requirements in Clauses 5.2.8 to 5.2.13.

39     Clause 5.3.3 of the COP Risk Management further states that a manager may authorize other persons to execute the duties mentioned above but he remains accountable for them.

40      Lee, as PM, was the manager who oversaw the workplace. He failed to ensure that risk assessment was carried out and risk control measures were implemented before the metal module formwork was used there.

41      _Fourth particular of negligence_: Lee’s failure to ensure that the control measures in the risk assessment for the works were implemented, specifically for the formwork activities within the workplace:

> (i)     The risk assessment that Lee approved indicated that as a safety control measure for the conventional formwork used prior to accident, the formworks were to be designed and certified by a PE. However, there was no PE design for the formworks used at the workplace, including the ones used at the accident area.

> (ii)     Another control measure was the appointment of a formwork supervisor which was also not implemented. As stated above in the COP Risk Management, Lee failed to ensure that the risk control measures were implemented without delay at the workplace.

## Sentencing Approach and Submissions

### The decision in Mao Xuezhong

42     Both the Prosecution and the Defence agreed that the sentencing framework set out by the three-judge panel of the High Court in _Mao Xuezhong_ should apply in the present case. As such, before outlining the arguments put forward by the parties, I will summarise the main aspects of _Mao Xuezhong_ so as to facilitate further discussion and analysis.

43      _Mao Xuezhong_ involved an offender who was a formwork supervisor. He claimed trial to a charge under section 15(3A) of the WSHA for performing a negligent act which resulted in the death of a worker. The particulars of his charge essentially stated that he instructed two workers (including the deceased) to descend onto a soffit top of an Aluma formwork when it was unsafe to do so, and that he failed to ensure that the deceased had anchored his safety harness before descending onto the soffit top. The offender was convicted and sentenced to 24 weeks’ imprisonment by the trial court.

44     He appealed against his conviction and sentence while the Prosecution appealed against the sentence. The Court dismissed the offender’s appeal against conviction and sentence, but allowed the Prosecution’s appeal against sentence. The Court enhanced the sentence to 12 months’ imprisonment.

45     In the course of deciding the appeal against sentence, the Court in _Mao Xuezhong_ had to consider the sentencing framework for offences under section 15(3A). At \[64\] of its judgement, the Court set out a two-step sentencing framework which applies to a first-time offender who claims trial to a charge under section 15(3A) of the WSHA.

46     The first step of the framework is to establish the level of harm and the level of culpability to derive the indicative starting point according to a matrix.

> (i)      **Harm** includes a consideration of the degree of both potential harm and actual harm caused i.e. the actual harm with a causal or contributory link to the risk created by the accused person’s negligent act. As for potential harm, the Court accepted the non-exhaustive factors affecting the degree of potential harm as enumerated in _Nurun Novi Saydur Rahman v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 413</span> (“_Nurun Novi”)_ at \[86\], i.e. the seriousness of the harm risked, the likelihood of that harm arising and the number of people likely to be exposed to the risk of that harm. Where the harm was likely to be death or serious injury (such as paralysis or loss of a limb), the harm could be considered to be high even though it did not materialise. If death or serious injury did occur, the harm would be graded near the top end of the high range.

> (ii)      **Culpability** includes a consideration of the nature of the unsafe act, the number of unsafe acts committed by the offender and the level of deviation from established procedure involved in the unsafe act (as per _Nurun Novi_ at \[87\]). Other relevant factors would include whether the unsafe acts were motivated by the offender’s desire to save on costs.

47     The proposed matrix that applies is set out below.

![]([2020] SGDC 0232_Image/[2020] SGDC 0232_image1.png)

48     Based on the above matrix, an imprisonment term may be appropriate where there is (a) high level of harm (or potential for harm) even with low culpability; (b) moderate harm (or potential for harm) with moderate culpability; or (c) high culpability regardless of harm.

49     The second step is to adjust the starting point according to offender-specific aggravating and mitigating factors that have not yet been factored into the analysis.

50     The Court in _Mao Xuezhong_ also held at \[67\] that both harm (which includes the risk of or potential for harm) and culpability are equally important considerations in section 15(3A) WSHA offences.

### Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

51     The Prosecution sought a custodial sentence of 2 months’ imprisonment for Tan, and 3 months’ imprisonment for Lee. The Prosecution submitted that based on the _Mao Xuezhong_ framework, the culpability for both Tan and Lee would fall within the low - medium category, and harm would fall within the high category. Accordingly, the sentence for Tan should not be less than 2 months’ imprisonment, and for Lee, who was the person overall in charge of the worksite, it should not be less than 3 months’ imprisonment.

52     As far as Tan’s particulars of negligence were concerned, the Prosecution argued that:

> (i)     As regards his failure to assist Chan & Chan, the occupier of the workplace to identify and assess any foreseeable risk arising from the formwork construction methods used to construct the high-tension cable conduit at HT0002 and HT0003:

>> a)       When Tan conducted site safety inspections, including at the work area where the accident occurred, he failed to notice that the workers in the Deceased’s team were deploying an unsafe and unauthorized method of constructing the formwork with steel plates. The level of potential harm for this was high.

>> b)       Tan’s failure also resulted in an unsafe method of work used to construct the high-tension cable conduit at HT0002 and HT0003, and serious injury or death could result from workers putting themselves in danger.

>> c)       Finally, as for the number of persons likely to be exposed to the risk of the harm, there were a total of six workers carrying out the construction of the cable conduit, at least two of who were within the excavation pit.

> (ii)     As regards Tan’s failure to recommend to Chan & Chan, the occupier, reasonably practicable measures to eliminate any foreseeable risk to any person who is at work in that workplace by failing to conduct risk assessments and safe work procedures for the use of metal module formwork at the workplace:

>> a)       The level of potential harm was high since his failure meant that there was no risk assessment, safe work procedure or method statement for the use of metal module formwork which was used to construct the high tension cable conduit. Further, as there were no risk assessment, the hazards and risks of using the metal module formwork was not assessed. Thus, no specific and appropriate control measure to mitigate or eliminate the risks of using the metal module formwork were put in place. Serious harm could have resulted as the lack of a risk assessment for the use of the metal module formwork could lead to serious injury or death.

>> b)       The likelihood of the harm arising was also high as the workers had been using the metal module formwork for several weeks at the worksite, prior to section HT0002 to HT0003.

>> c)       Finally, the six workers carrying out the construction of the cable conduit were likely to be exposed to the risk of the harm in this case.

53     As far as Lee’s particulars of negligence were concerned, the Prosecution argued that:

> (i)     As regards his failure to review the work method and processes for the formwork construction for the high-tension cable conduit at HT0002 and HT0003:

>> a)       Due to his failure to review the work methods, the workers had no specific method of work to construct the formworks at HT0002 and HT0003. Both the potential for harm, and the likelihood of the harm arising, were high, since the workers resorted to carrying out the works with an unsafe method as they did not have any other work method to use here.

>> b)       The number of persons likely to be exposed to the risk of harm were the six workers carrying out the construction of the cable conduit.

> (ii)     As regards Lee’s failure to ensure that Chan & Chan appointed a formwork supervisor for formwork activities at the workplace: This failure resulted in the absence of required supervision for the formwork activities, and could have led to serious harm such as serious injury or death. Further, the WSH regulations specifically require the immediate supervision of formwork supervisor as this is considered a high-risk activity. The potential for harm for this failure was thus high.

> (iii)     As regards Lee’s failure to approve risk assessments and safe work procedures for the use of metal module formwork at the workplace: This failure could lead to serious injury or death. Further, as there were no risk assessment, the hazards and risks of using the metal module formwork was not assessed, and thus no specific and appropriate control measure to mitigate or eliminate the risks of using the metal formwork was put in place. The likelihood of the harm arsing was also high as the workers had been using the metal module formwork prior to section HT0002 to HT0003, for several weeks. Finally, the six workers carrying out the construction of the cable conduit were likely to be exposed to the risk, especially as at least two of them were in the excavation pit.

> (iv)     As regards Lee’s failure to ensure that the control measures in the risk assessment for the works were implemented specifically for the formwork activities within the workplace: The Prosecution argued that with no control measures, the hazards and risks of constructing formworks, both conventional and metal module formworks, were not mitigated. The likelihood of the harm arsing was also high as the workers had been using both the conventional and metal module formwork prior to section HT0002 to HT0003, for several weeks. Again, there were six workers carrying out the construction of the cable conduit who were exposed to this risk.

54     All in all, taking into account the factors set out in _Mao Xuezhong_ for considering the level of harm, including the degree of potential harm, such as the seriousness of the harm risked, the likelihood of that harm arising and the number of people likely to be exposed to the risk of that harm, the Prosecution argued that the level of harm would be high as a result of the negligence of the accused persons.

55     As for culpability, the Prosecution argued that as the breaches committed by the accused persons were not duties imposed on them directly, and as their roles were to ensure that these requirements were met or to advise Chan and Chan of them, their culpability could be assessed to be within the low-medium category. However, this would be at the middle to upper limits of the low category, due to the nature and extent of their negligent acts.

56     Following the sentencing matrix set out in _Mao Xuezhong_, and as the present case would fall within the high harm and low-medium culpability category, this would mean an indicative sentence of up to 6 months’ imprisonment each for Tan and Lee. Further, Lee’s culpability should be regarded as higher than that of Tan, as Lee was the person overall in charge of the workplace.

57     The Prosecution submitted for a starting sentence of 3 months’ imprisonment for Tan and 4 months imprisonment for Lee. Thereafter, considering that the accused person had pleaded guilty, although at a late stage, and since they had expressed remorse for their acts, the sentence may be discounted to reflect these mitigating factors. All in all, the Prosecution proposed a final sentence of 2 months’ imprisonment for Tan, and 3 months’ imprisonment for Lee.

### Mitigation Plea and the Defence submissions on sentence

58     The Defence also agreed that the _Mao Xuezhong_ framework should apply to sentencing in the present case. However, the Defence argued that both harm and culpability were low for both accused persons and that accordingly, fines would be proportionate and appropriate sentences for both of them. The Defence specifically suggested for a fine of S$15,000 to S$30,000 each for Lee and Tan, as a fair and just punishment in this case.

59     In its mitigation plea, the Defence emphasised that the negligence of Tan and Lee neither caused nor contributed to the accident that led to the death of the Deceased. The Defence further argued that the manner in which the accident happened was not reasonably contemplated by Tan, Lee or any of the Site Supervisors. In addition, the Defence highlighted that that there was a risk assessment and safe work procedure for the construction of the timber formwork, and argued that the procedure for the construction of the metal module formwork was very similar to that for the timber formwork.

60     Regarding the specific acts of negligence, the Defence put forward the following propositions with respect to the harm and culpability considerations that they argued should apply to Tan and Lee’s acts of negligence.

61     As far as Tan’s particulars of negligence were concerned, the Defence argued that on the issue of harm:

> (i)     For his failure to assist Chan & Chan, the occupier of the workplace to identify and assess any foreseeable risk arising from the formwork construction methods used to construct the high-tension cable conduit at HT0002 and HT0003:

>> a)       There was nothing inherently dangerous in sections HT0002 and HT0003 as the potential issues that arose there were the space constraints and whether the existence of electrical cables would impede the construction of the high tension cable conduits. Neither did the conditions there present a high risk of harm to the worker Instead, the potential issues that arose at HT0002 and HT0003, due to the space constraints and existence of electrical cables, were not safety issues but technical ones.

>> b)       It was not part of Tan’s charge that he failed to notice the workers in the Deceased’s team were deploying the unsafe and unauthorised method of steel plates to construct the formwork. Furthermore, it was unreasonable to expect Tan to have personally noticed the unauthorised work method used by the Deceased in a large worksite that spanned 500 metres, especially when the supervisors themselves, who were stationed onsite and tasked to supervise the workers, had failed to notice that the Deceased’s team was using the unauthorised method.

>> c)       The Deceased had acted unilaterally by using an unauthorised method of deploying steel plates at HT0002 and HT0003 without seeking prior approval. Hence, the Deceased’s unauthorised act of deploying a method that he had improvised on his own, would not have fallen within the reasonable contemplation of Tan. The nature of Tan’s unsafe act thus did not contribute to or cause the fatality, and he would not be in a position to recommend any reasonably practicable measure to eliminate a risk that he could not have reasonably anticipated. Further, there was no basis to assume that the workers may use their own methods if no clear instructions were given. In addition, at the toolbox meeting on the day of the accident, the Deceased did not raise any issues or consult the Site Supervisor about the method of construction to be deployed for the formwork structures.

> (ii)     For Tan’s failure to recommend to Chan & Chan, the occupier, reasonably practicable measures to eliminate any foreseeable risk to any person who is at work in that workplace by failing to conduct risk assessments and safe work procedures for the use of metal module formwork at the workplace:

>> a)       Notwithstanding no formal documentation in the form of risk assessments and safe work procedures for the use of metal module formwork at the workplace, the risk and likelihood of harm arising from such failure was low as the safety issues and potential hazards for the construction of timber formwork (for which there was documentation) were equally applicable for the metal module formwork method of construction.

>> b)       The site conditions of the workplace did not present high risks unlike worksites which are inherently precarious in nature, with such usual “high risk” factors like work-from-height, or on unstable platforms supported by rollers without much safety barricades.

62     While Tan’s negligent act, comprising of only two particulars, were arguably both assessed to be of a “low” level of harm, the Defence acknowledged that viewed in its entirety, Tan’s negligent act may fall at the higher-end of the “low” category up to the lower end of the “medium” category in relation to the level of harm.

63     As for the level of Tan’s culpability, the Defence argued that the negligent act in question fell within the “low” category as the charge related only to the formwork structures, and in respect of endangering the safety of the workers constructing formworks for the high tension cable conduits. Tan’s failure did not extend to the entirety of the works performed at the workplace. Further, the Defence highlighted that the Prosecution had recognised that these breaches were not specifically duties imposed on Tan directly, and his role was to supervise the workplace or to advise Chan & Chan.

64     As for Lee’s particulars of negligence, the Defence argued that as regards the issue of harm:

> (i)     For his failure to review the work method and processes for the formwork construction for the high-tension cable conduit at HT0002 and HT0003:

>> a)       The breach should be seen as a technical oversight in its lack of proper documentation, since there was a work method and a process for the construction of timber formwork in the risk assessment, which were equally applicable for the metal module formwork method of construction. There was also nothing inherently more dangerous about the deployment of metal module formwork as compared to the timber formwork. Further, the workers had commonly used the metal module formwork to construct the conduit for several weeks without incident until the section between HT0002 and HT0003, and they were also familiar with using either the timber or metal module methods to construct the formwork structure.

>> b)       Thus, the risk and likelihood of harm arising from Lee’s failure to formally review the work method and processes for formwork construction at HT0002 and HT0003 were low, and in the absence of a work method and process for formwork construction at HT0002 and HT0003, the workers could have applied either the timber formwork method or the metal module formwork method, which would have posed no issues.

>> c)       Further, the conditions at sections HT0002 and HT0003 did not objectively present a high risk of harm to workers, since they did not involve risks such as working from height or having workers exposed to risks arising from the elements of nature.

> (ii)     As regards Lee’s failure to ensure that Chan & Chan appointed a formwork supervisor for formwork activities at the workplace: This failure was due to an oversight, but the risk and level of potential harm were low as the conditions at the worksite were low risk, especially as the excavation pit only measured 1.5 m deep and did not extend far beneath ground level. Further, formwork activities only comprised a small portion of all the work at the workplace. The workers were also supervised in many areas of their work, and there were other persons on site monitoring the works.

> (iii)     As regards Lee’s failure to approve risk assessments and safe work procedures for the use of metal module formwork at the workplace: The risk and likelihood of harm arising from this failure was low as the safety issues and potential hazards for the construction of timber formwork were equally applicable for the metal module formwork method of construction, and the presence of the documented risk assessment and safe work procedure for the timber formwork mitigated the risk. Further, the metal module formwork method is commonly used in the construction industry in the construction of formwork structures, and the workers were familiar with it due to their experience from other projects. All safety briefings and instructions given in the toolbox meetings were also based on the workers using the metal module formwork.

> (iv)     As regards Lee’s failure to ensure that the control measures in the risk assessment for the works were implemented specifically for the formwork activities within the workplace:

>> a)       Given the site conditions of the workplace with its low-risk factors, construction of formworks was not a high-risk activity, and the level of harm arising from this breach was “low”. While another control measure in the risk assessment, which related to the formwork design being calculated and endorsed by a PE, was not implemented, the risk of harm and likelihood of harm arising from the absence of a PE endorsement were low since the PE’s role did not go towards addressing the safety risks involved in implementing or constructing the formwork _per se_.

>> b)       Further, Lee’s failure to implement this control measure as per the risk assessment was purely an oversight as a PE endorsement was not necessary, but was merely an additional precaution contained in the risk assessment. Thus, the resulting risk or likelihood of harm arising from Lee’s failure to implement this control measure was extremely low, taking into account that MOM’s Circular does not even require it.

65     Thus, all in all, the Defence argued that harm in Lee’s case was low.

66     As for Lee’s culpability, the Defence argued that this was also low.

> (i)     As regards the work area between HT0002 and HT0003, whilst Lee was aware of the space constraints and the presence of cables there, he had discussed these site conditions with his direct subordinates like the Site Supervisors and Site Managers, and was waiting for further feedback from them on the actual work conditions on the ground. Thus, his failure to review the work method and processes for the formwork construction of the HTCC at HT0002 and HT0003 was simply a result of a lack of initiative to follow up with them when he did not hear back from them. Further, considering that this was a large worksite, it was unreasonable and unrealistic to expect Lee to have personally noticed the unauthorised work method deployed by the Deceased. Indeed, even the Site Supervisors (who were stationed on-site) had failed to notice the Deceased’s team use of the unauthorised method before the accident.

> (ii)     On his culpability as regards the other aspects of negligence regarding the metal module formwork, there was no evidence that Lee had flagrantly omitted to ensure that Chan & Chan appoint a formwork supervisor as a cost-cutting measure or to reduce headcount. Lee was also aware that the workers were adequate briefed at the workplace by the Site Supervisors, Site Managers and the Safety Supervisor in using metal modules formworks. He was also aware that the workers were adequately trained in using the metal module formwork, given their past technical experience and training for other projects where this method of construction was similarly used. Lee’s failure should thus be seen a lack of formal documentation instead of a wanton disregard for the personal safety of the workers. There was also nothing on the facts to suggest that Lee had shown a deliberate, wanton disregard for the safety of the workers despite being aware of works being carried out in an inherently perilous worksite.

67     The Defence further argued that there was no causative link between the negligence of Lee and Tan and the fatal accident, as it was the Deceased who had unilaterally instructed his team to use steel plates for the construction of the formwork at the accident site. Further, as the project was extensive, Lee and Tan had reasonably relied on the Site Supervisors, Site Managers and engineers to ensure site supervision and management on the ground. In addition, both accused persons had cooperated with the authorities in their investigations and they had also swiftly implemented various remedial actions after the accident. The accused persons also had clean records. Finally, their plea of guilt should be accorded full mitigatory weight.

68     Thus, based on the _Mao Xuezhong framework_, the Defence argued that a fine of more than S$15,000 and up to S$30,000 each for Lee and Tan, was appropriate and sufficient in this case.

## The Court’s decision on Sentence

69     In _Mao Xuezhong_, High Court at \[47\] had explained the legislative intent of the WSHA as follows:

> **_“_**The legislative intent of the WSHA, as recognised in both _Nurun Novi_ at \[73(a)\] and _GS Engineering_ at \[51\], was to improve workplace safety by effecting a “cultural change” for employers and other stakeholders **_to take proactive measures_** to prevent accidents. This is to be achieved in part through ensuring that **_the penalties for non-compliance are sufficiently high to deter risktaking behaviour_**. The implication is that Parliament’s intention was for the courts to impose higher penalties where appropriate to achieve the necessary deterrent effect. The penalty regime under the WSHA applies beyond situations where actual harm resulted. It provides for meaningful penalties where there are severe lapses, even if no accidents happened: _Nurun Novi_ at \[73(b)\]. It was expressly recognised in Parliament that the penalty to be applied in any given case will take into account the culpability of the offender, the potential harm that could have been caused and the harm actually done: _Nurun Novi_ at \[73(c)\].”

\[emphasis added\]

70     Guided by the above intent, and after analysing two earlier High Court decisions, namely _Nurun Novi_, and _Public Prosecutor v GS Engineering & Construction Corp_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 276</span> (“_GS Engineering_”), the High Court in _Mao Xuezhong_ came up with the sentencing framework and sentencing matrix for s 15(3A) of the WSHA. These have been set out at \[45\] – \[50\] above.

71     To reiterate, the two-step framework involves the following:

> (i)     First, that there has to be a consideration of (1) the level of harm, including both actual harm caused and potential harm (determined by considerations such as the seriousness of the harm, the likelihood of harm arising and the number of people likely to be exposed to the harm); and (2) the level of culpability of the offender. These considerations would give an indicative starting point for the sentence according to a sentencing matrix.

> (ii)     Second, a consideration of the offender-specific aggravating and mitigating factors that have not yet been factored into the analysis.

72     While agreeing that the _Mao Xuezhong_ framework should apply, the Prosecution and Defence had nonetheless arrived at different indicative starting points, and hence quite dissimilar proposed sentences at the end. It was clear that the main difference in the sentences arrived at stemmed from the separate conclusions reached by parties as to the degree of potential harm that could have resulted from the accused persons’ acts of negligence. Specifically, the Prosecution had argued that the degree of potential harm (and hence the level of harm) was high, while the Defence submitted that the level of harm should be assessed to be low.

### The indicative starting point: Assessment of Harm and Culpability

73     Having carefully analysed the arguments put forward by parties to justify their respective sentencing positions, I agreed with the conclusions reached by the Prosecution, both as to the indicative starting points for Tan and Lee, and also the final sentences that should be imposed on the accused persons.

74     Specifically, I was of the view that the Prosecution (but not the Defence) had correctly and comprehensively applied all three of the non-exhaustive factors identified in _Nurun Novi_ which affect the degree of potential harm. These same three factors were also accepted in _Mao Xuezhong_, namely:

> (i)     the seriousness of the harm risked;

> (ii)     the likelihood of that harm arising; and

> (iii)     the number of people likely to be exposed to the risk of that harm.

75     Thus, while I accepted that parties had agreed that the negligence of Tan and Lee had neither caused nor contributed to the accident that led to the death of the Deceased, I was of the view that the level of harm was high, chiefly because the degree of potential harm was high. I elaborate below.

#### The level of harm: Tan’s charge

76     With respect to Tan’s negligent act, this comprised two particulars, both of which related to formwork activities.

77     The first particular related to Tan’s failure to assist Chan & Chan, the occupier of the workplace, to identify and assess any foreseeable risk arising from the formwork construction methods used to construct the high-tension cable conduit at HT0002 and HT0003:

> (i)     As regards the likelihood of harm:

>> a)       It was stated in Tan’s SOF (that he had accepted without qualification), that Tan had conducted site safety inspections, including at the work area where the accident occurred. Despite this, he had failed to notice that the workers in the Deceased’s team were deploying an unsafe and unauthorized method of constructing the formwork with steel plates.

>> b)       Further, prior to the use of this unauthorised formwork at this section, it was the metal module formwork that was used by the workers for a few weeks at the other parts of the workplace. Thus, while the Deceased and the workers may have been more familiar with the metal module formwork by the time they started work at this section, the unauthorised and unsafe method actually adopted at HT0002 and HT0003 for constructing the formwork, was something that would likely be new and unfamiliar to all of them, including the Deceased. This may have increased the likelihood of harm that could be caused.

>> c)       Further, as rightly pointed out by the Prosecution[^2], both accused persons had accepted in their respective SOFs that there was a space limitation at this location, and that the use of the metal module formwork was not possible here. This suggested that the built environment was really quite different from what existed before this section, and both accused persons were aware of this.

>> d)       To make things worse, it was also stated in the SOFs that none of the workers, including the Deceased was trained to be a formwork supervisor (for the purposes of the Workplace Safety and Health (Construction) Regulations 2007. Clearly, the likelihood of harm was high.

> (ii)     As for the seriousness of the harm, I agreed with the Prosecution that this was also high. In this regard, as stated in the SOFs, the formwork for each section of the high-tension cable conduit was constructed using two steel plates placed vertically along their lengths and held in place with props. Each plate measured about 6m (length) by 1.5m (height) by 20mm (thickness) and weighed about 1 ton. One of these plates fell onto the Deceased when he was at this section, and in the excavation pit. A plate of this size and weight, falling on workers in a pit (with its confined space), could clearly cause quite serious injuries or death. Obviously, the seriousness of harm was also high.

> (iii)     As for the third factor affecting the assessment of potential harm i.e. the number of potential victims, it was undisputed that the Deceased’s team consisted of six people who were involved in the work at this section. It was this high number of people that was thus likely to be exposed to the risk of that harm.

> (iv)     While the Defence suggested there was nothing inherently dangerous in sections HT0002 and HT0003, and argued that the potential issues that arose there concern the space constraints and whether the existence of electrical cables would impede the construction of the high-tension cable conduit, with respect, the Defence failed to appreciate that Tan had accepted (in his SOF at \[42\]) that despite having conducted the safety inspections at the work area where the accident occurred, he had failed to notice that the workers in the Deceased’s team were deploying an unsafe and unauthorized method of constructing the formwork with steel plates. The Defence also failed to appreciate the other risk factors including the fact that the steel plates weighed one ton each, and that the Deceased was also in an evacuation pit when the plate fell onto him. Aside from him, his team consisted of another five members who were similarly involved in the formwork construction at that section. I would add that aside from failing to appreciate the factors that pointed to the seriousness of the harm, the Defence also failed to address the likelihood of harm, and the fact that there were a total of six workers, including the Deceased, who were literally in harm’s way.

> (v)     All in all, I agreed with the Prosecution that the level of harm must be regarded as high.

78     For Tan, the second particular of his negligent act related to his failure to recommend to the occupier of the workplace reasonably practicable measures to eliminate any foreseeable risk to any person who is at work in that workplace, by failing to conduct risk assessments and safe work procedures for the use of metal module formwork at the workplace:

> (i)     There was no risk assessment, safe work procedure or a method statement for the use of metal module formwork in the construction of the high tension cable conduit. I agreed with the Prosecution that this meant that the hazards and risks of using the metal module formwork had not been formally assessed, nor was there any safety or control measure necessarily put in place to deal with any potential risk that may arise in connection with the use of the metal module formwork at that workplace. Certainly the risk of death or serious injury could not be ruled out, especially since there was no formal measure put in to prevent risks that had not even been assessed or identified in the first place. This was particularly disconcerting since the workers had been using the metal module formwork for at least several weeks before the accident occurred, and there were six workers (including the Deceased) who were exposed to associated dangers during this period. All in all, I agreed that the likelihood and seriousness of harm were high, as were the number of workers exposed to the risk of harm.

> (ii)     The Defence suggested that the safety issues and potential hazards for the construction of timber formwork (for which there was documentation) were equally applicable for the metal module formwork method of construction, and hence this reduced the risk posed by using the latter method of construction.

>> a)       However, the Prosecution disagreed with this argument, highlighting that a different work method requires a specific risk assessment as the work activities and conditions are different. In this regard, as quite rightly pointed out by the Prosecution, I noted that even “(w)ithin the mitigation, one key difference is the weight of the formwork. At \[22\] the mitigation states that the weight of timber formwork is about 47.95 kg and at \[24\] states the metal module formwork weighs 91.85kg. Just this one difference in the weights of the formworks, would have required different methods of handling this formwork.” [^3]

>> b)       I would add that the importance of proper formwork construction in the workplace was laid bare by the many requirements set out in Tan’s SOF that he admitted to in relation to the formwork used,[^4] including the need for a formwork supervisor to supervise the construction of the formwork, the need for daily inspection of the formwork, and also for a certificate to be issued by a PE upon completion of the formwork. These requirements suggested that a lot more attention has to be put into the different types of framework use and construction, and went against the Defence’s suggestion that the lack of documentation for the metal module framework construction was a matter of little concern.

>> c)       As for other arguments raised by the Defence, I was respectfully of the view that the fact that the workers may have used the metal module formwork for other projects was irrelevant since presumably no two worksite conditions or work projects are exactly the same, as otherwise the various requirements for assessments, measures or documentation for the workplaces would hardly have been necessary. Neither was it relevant that the metal module formwork method of construction had been used in that particular worksite without incident previously, since this could have been merely fortuitous. Further, this consideration was not really pivotal, when assessing potential for harm, as opposed to assessing actual harm.

>> d)       Finally, not only did the Defence fail to show that Tan’s failing here was not relevant to the likelihood of harm, the Defence again failed to address the other factors set out in _Mao Xuezhong_ , namely the seriousness of harm that may be caused, and the number of persons which may be affected by such risk.

> (iii)     As for the Defence’s claim that the site conditions of the workplace did not present the “usual” high risks factors, like work from height or work on unstable platforms supported by rollers without safety barricades, with respect, again it was clear that not all workplaces are the same, nor do they all need to have the same type of risks. Otherwise there would not be a need for any kind of risk assessment or safe work procedure for worksites that do not have such “usual factors” as identified by the Defence, even if they do pose risks in other ways.

> (iv)     Further, it was not entirely clear what the Defence meant by a workplace that presents “high risk factors”. In this regard, where large steel plates that weigh one ton are present, and where such steel plates are employed as part of the metal module construction process at a workplace,[^5] it could just as easily be argued that the conditions of this workplace meant it qualified as “high risk”, by virtue of such items being used on site.

79     All in all, I agreed with the Prosecution that the particulars of Tan’s negligent act placed him in the high harm category.

#### The level of harm: Lee’s charge

80     With respect to Lee’s negligent act, this comprised four particulars relating to formwork activities. Many of the same considerations and arguments that were raised in Tan’s case, were also raised for Lee.

81     I have essentially dealt with many of these arguments when commenting on Tan’s particulars of negligence, and my views on them apply equally as regards Lee’s failures. I would merely add that as far as Lee’s particulars of negligence were concerned:

> (i)     As regards his failure to review the work method and processes for the formwork construction for the high-tension cable conduit at HT0002 and HT0003:

>> a)       At Lee’s SOF at \[41\], Lee had “… explained that it was not possible to use the metal module formworks at this location as there was a space limitation due to the existing live high tension cables. The workers would not be able to adjust the metal formwork and put the propping as there was not enough space due to the existing live cable at this location.”

>> b)       Yet despite being aware of this limitation prior to the accident, Lee had failed to review the work method and processes for the formwork construction at this accident location. Neither, it would seem, did he give any instruction or guidance as to what should be done, or even, order for work to be stopped, until a solution could be found.

>> c)       I thus agreed with the Prosecution that in the circumstances, and as the workers had no specific method to construct the formworks at HT0002 and HT0003, the potential for harm, and the likelihood of the harm arising were both high, as the workers resorted to using an unauthorised and unsafe method since the authorised and approved method was not suitable, and the workers were not told to stop work or given instruction of any approved alternative method to use. Lee’s failure thus clearly posed a risk to the six workers carrying out the construction of the cable conduit.

>> d)       While the Defence argued that the other approved methods could have, and should have, been used by the workers instead, with respect, this argument clearly went against what Lee himself had admitted in his SOF about his own belief (as he had explained in his statement during the investigations[^6]), that the limitations at the accident site prevented the use of the approved methods of construction. In any event, it was only after the accident, that it was found that the timber and metal module method of construction could actually have been used at the accident location.

>> e)       This, however, was clearly of no help to the Defence. Instead, quite aside from raising the question of why Lee had not realised this earlier, the fact remained that Lee had failed to review the work method and processes for the formwork construction at this location before the accident occurred, and that he was clearly of the view, at the time of the accident, that the space limitation prevented the use of the metal module method of construction. In such circumstances, he could hardly have expected the workers to know, believe or act otherwise.

> (ii)     As regards Lee’s failure to ensure Chan & Chan appointed a formwork supervisor for formwork activities at the workplace: I accepted that this was an important failing on Lee’s part and one that could lead to serious harm such as serious injury or death to all six workers involved in the formwork construction. The importance attached to proper supervision, construction and certification of the formwork, consistent with the WSH regulations, was clear as this was considered a high-risk activity, and this failing could not be ignored just because there were other supervisors at the workplace, since Site Supervisors who may not be trained or equipped to perform the task.[^7] I thus agreed with the Prosecution that the potential for harm due to this failure was also high.

> (iii)     As regards Lee’s failure to approve risk assessments and safe work procedures for the use of metal module formwork at the workplace: As stated earlier when assessing Tan’s charge, without a risk assessment of the metal module formwork construction, the dangers that this method could pose at this workplace were simply not known. Worst of all, this meant that the six workers had been using the metal module formwork prior to section HT0002 to HT0003 for several weeks, without the risks to them being properly assessed, let alone addressed.

> (iv)     As regards Lee’s failure to ensure that the control measures in the risk assessment for the works were implemented specifically for the formwork activities within the workplace: Similar to the considerations above, with no control measures put in place, the possible risks and harm to the six workers were not mitigated. Instead, without Lee ensuring that the control measures were put in place, for the several weeks leading up to section HT0002 to HT0003, these same workers were exposed, but were not necessarily shielded or protected against any of these risks.

82     In summary, as with Tan’s situation, when one considered the non-exhaustive factors affecting the degree of potential harm as affirmed by the High Court in _Mao Xuezhong_, one could not but come to the conclusion that Lee’s case also fell squarely within the high harm category of the sentencing matrix.

#### Culpability of accused persons and the indicative starting sentence

83     Both the accused persons had important roles to play in managing risks and ensuring the safety of the workers at the workplace. They were also given training in various safety aspects. Specifically, Tan, who was appointed and trained as the WSHO had received various forms of formal training in safety related matters, as had Lee, the PM who had overall control of all the works carried out at the worksite, and who had also received training in safety and risk management before.

84     They were thus expected to perform important roles in managing risk and ensuring safety measures were put in place. They had clearly failed to play their parts, resulting in their present convictions on charges of committing negligent acts without reasonable cause, which endangered the safety of workers who were constructing the high-tension cable conduit at the workplace.

85     As regards their culpabilities, both the Prosecution and the Defence broadly submitted that the level of culpability for each accused person was low. To the extent that it was clear the primary duty in these matters was that of the employer rather than the individual accused persons, I did not disagree with parties that the accused persons’ culpabilities could be assessed to be low.

86     Thereafter, based on the sentencing matrix set out in _Mao Xuezhong_, the indicative starting points for Tan and Lee’s sentences for the assessment “high level of harm (or potential for harm) even with low culpability” would be up to six months’ imprisonment. As between the two of them, in light of their individual roles and duties, and the nature and extent of their negligent acts. I also accepted that Lee, as the person overall in charge of the workplace, had higher culpability than Tan. I thus accepted the Prosecution’s submission that the indicative starting sentence for Tan should be 3 months’ imprisonment, while that of Lee should be 4 months’ imprisonment.

87     This was of course subject to further adjustment to take into account any applicable aggravating or mitigating factor.

### Aggravating and mitigating circumstances

88     Moving on the second-stage of the sentencing framework, I noted that the accused persons had pleaded guilty, albeit only after trial dates had been set. Counsel also highlighted that they had rendered co-operation and had put in place remedial measures. I also accepted that the accused persons’ actions did not have a direct causative link to the accident that had subsequently occurred.

89     All things considered, I agreed with the Prosecution’s proposed sentence of 2 months’ imprisonment for Tan, and 3 months’ imprisonment for Lee, as being fair and proportionate on the facts of the case.

90     The accused persons, being dissatisfied, have filed appeals against their sentences. They are currently on bail pending the hearing of the appeal.
