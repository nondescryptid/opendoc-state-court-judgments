Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Corrective Training

19 August 2022

### District Judge Shawn Ho:

## Introduction

1       The arc of the Accused’s crimes can be traced to more than 20 years ago. Given his many dishonesty-related antecedents, culminating in 7 years of Corrective Training in 2013, the Accused’s past assumed a certain salience.

2       The Accused faced 20 charges. He pleaded guilty to 7 charges under ss 420, 420A and 506 of the Penal Code and s 3(1)(b) of the Protection from Harassment Act.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) His methods of deceit morphed from chat lines to Yahoo! Message boards to social media platforms such as Gumtree, Craigslist and Locanto.[^2] In the present case, he used a similar modus operandi and preyed on female victims — female strangers, female escorts and female teenagers.[^3] He wined and dined a victim at Fullerton Hotel,[^4] booked hotel rooms in or near the Central Business District,[^5] and told a 17-year old girl of his gift of a Chopard necklace, which was untrue.[^6] This foreshadowed a cadence of lies, made manifest by bank account screenshots,[^7] bounced cheques,[^8] and a video of him depositing a cheque (which bounced).[^9]

3       He obtained sexual services from girls as young as 17 without making any payment through deception.[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10) Ill-treatment was visited upon his victims. For example, halfway during sex with V5, V5 told him to stop as it was painful for her; he stopped for a brief moment but asked her to try to continue — he then inserted his penis into V5’s vagina, causing her to scream out of pain.[^11] And he afforded the victims little sympathy, as evidenced from his criminal intimidation charge and another offence of threatening to beat up a 17-year old victim and her baby.

4       Accordingly, it does not lie in his mouth to say that the Escalation principle should not apply to his present charges. At its heart, specific deterrence is engaged for his reprehensible conduct.

5       The Prosecution sought at least 10 years of Corrective Training (“CT”). The Defence nailed its colours to the mast of a regular imprisonment term.[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12)

6       All things considered, I sentenced the Accused to 9 years of CT.

## Charges

7       The Accused pleaded guilty to 7 charges under ss 420, 420A and 506 of the Penal Code and s 3(1)(b) of the Protection from Harassment Act (“POHA”). These 7 charges were as follows:

## Summary of facts

9       The accused is Tan Chip Huat, a 49-year-old male Singaporean.[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21)

#### Facts relating to the 2nd charge (DAC 920748-2021)

10     The first victim is \[redacted\], female, 25 years old (“V1”).

11     On 15 June 2021 at 11.23 p.m., V1 made a police report stating that she had been cheated by the accused.

12     Sometime in early May 2021, V1 became acquainted with the accused on a social media platform Locanto. Both the accused and V1 were looking for casual sex. They met up frequently every two to three days. The accused introduced himself as someone who was working in finance industry handling high-end clients. He also boasted to her that he had a personal driver to chauffeur him around. In actual fact, the accused did not have a job at this point and did not have any other sources of income.

13     V1 shared with the accused that she had credit card debts of about S$5,000. During their third meet-up, the accused offered to settle V1’s debts. According to V1, he made V1 believe that he would transfer a sum of S$77,000 to her to pay off her debts. He showed V1 a screenshot of a S$77,000 bank transfer purportedly made to V1’s bank account. When V1 enquired the purpose of the transfer to her bank account, the accused told V1 that he was bad at managing his finances and he wanted V1 to safekeep the remaining amount for him after she used part of the sum to settle her debts. According to V1, she believed him.

14     A few days later, the accused borrowed money from V1. When V1 knew that the accused had no money, V1 offered him her V1 credit card to buy gifts for his parents as birthday presents. According to V1, she gave her credit card to him because she believed the accused that the sum of S$77,000 from the accused would ultimately be credited into her bank account and she could recover the accused’s expenses from this sum. The accused used V1’s credit card to make several purchases. He bought Apple iPhones using V1’s credit card to resell them for his own profits. V1 paid for some of the staycations they had, and the accused paid for some of them. In total, V1 suffered monetary losses of S$11,645.36.

15     V1 did not receive the sum of S$77,000 in her bank account from the accused. The accused knew that at all material times, he did not have S$77,000 to transfer to the victim and had no money to settle her debts. When V1 checked with the accused for the purported transfer, he claimed that his company was having an audit and the sum would be credited later. However, the sum of $77,000 was never credited into V1’s bank account. On 18 June and 28 June 2021, the accused wrote two cheques for S$35,000 and S$23,000 and banked both cheques into V1’s bank account to appease her, despite knowing that both cheques would bounce. Both cheques eventually bounced. After the cheques bounced, he also sent her a screenshot on 7 July 2021 showing a transfer of S$57,000 to her bank account, which was fake and did not actualise. The accused also sent V1 an image of a nurse in the hospital and told her that he was hospitalised. However, V1 searched the image online and found that the image was taken from an online website. V1 also searched the accused’s name and found out that the accused was previously convicted for cheating offences. V1 confronted the accused and he lied to her that he was waiting for a payment which he claimed he would receive for the jail time he had served. V1 eventually decided to lodge a Police report.

16     In actual fact, the accused did not have the sum of $77,000 to begin with and had no intention to deposit the sum to V1’s bank account. At all material times, his bank account did not have more than S$4,000. The accused had deceived V1 into believing that she will receive the said sum of monies. Due to such deception, the accused had dishonestly induced V1 to deliver a collective sum of S$11,645.36 to him. To date, the accused made no restitution to V1.

17     By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence under Section 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

#### Facts relating to the 6th charge (DAC-922244-2021)

18     The second victim is \[redacted\], a 23-year-old female Singaporean (“V2”). At the time of the offence, the victim was a full-time wedding planner and a freelance social escort.

19     On 19 July 2021 at 3.20 p.m., V2 lodged a Police report informing that on 5 July 2021, she was cheated by the accused. The incident location provided was Fragrance Hotel Lavender located at 51 Lavender Street, Singapore. 12 Sometime on 5 July 2021, V2 received messages on Telegram from the accused bearing the Telegram handle “@Jaylen1888”. The messages stated: “Read your ads in locanto…this jaylen” and “Just joined locanto recently”.

20     V2 has worked as a freelance social escort since she was 19 years old. She posted about offering sexual services on Locanto and Telegram. Her posts included providing sexual services for an hour at S$350 and two hours for S$500. V2 shared with the accused that she has not been working for the past seven months. The accused then offered to pay her S$6,000 a month for her to be his “sugar baby”. He told V2 that he was in his 30s and was working in a family business. He told her that the arrangement would be for them to meet once to twice a week for sexual intercourse and for them to have two staycations. The accused asked V2 to meet up the same day.

21     The accused brought V2 to dine at a Japanese restaurant at Fullerton Hotel where the accused told V2 that he was willing to pay her S$20,000 for a long-term sexual relationship. He then handed her a cheque and asked her to write S$10,000 as the amount. She did and kept the cheque. They continued with their dinner and discussed about having sex. According to V2, believing that she would be paid a sum of S$10,000 for a long-term sexual relationship with the accused, V2 agreed to have paid sex with him as long as he wore a condom. After the accused paid for the dinner, they took a taxi and headed to Fragrance Hotel (Lavender) where they had sex for the first and only time. They had unprotected sex, on the accused’s insistence.

22     At 3 p.m. of the next day (6 July 2021), V2 went to deposit the cheque of S$10,000.

23     On 7 July 2021, V2 checked her bank account and realised that the S$10,000 did not go into her account and the cheque bounced. She asked the accused about the bounced cheque. After negotiation with the accused on the payment through Project X (an organisation which provides assistance to sex workers), the accused and V2 compromised on a sum of S$3,500 which the accused said he would transfer to her account by 8 July 2021.

24     On 9 July 2021, the accused sent a video of him dropping a cheque of S$3,500 into a quick cheque deposit slot. The accused wrote V2’s bank account details on the cheque and wrote “Cash” for the payee. He promised her that the cheque would “definitely” not bounce. When V2 checked her bank account on the next working day on 12 July 2021, no money was credited. She later contacted him to tell him that the S$3,500 cheque had bounced again. The accused apologised and told her his salary was delayed. He sent her a screenshot of his bank account which had a balance of S$9.54. On almost every day till 25 July 2021, the accused made various excuses that his salary was delayed. When V2 said that she would lodge a Police report, the accused told her that he would deposit cash in her bank account the next day, and that if she went to the Police, he would not pay her. V2 eventually decided to lodge a Police report on 19 July 2021 when the accused failed to pay her. At all material times, the accused knew that he had no sum of S$10,000 or S$3,500 to pay V2. He knew that the cheques for S$10,000 and S$3,500 would bounce. In actual fact, the accused was unemployed at the material time.

25     Accordingly, the accused had obtained the sexual services from V2 dishonestly by deceiving her into believing that he would pay her a sum of S$10,000 for a long-term sexual relationship with him, and her sexual services were made available to him on the basis that payment will be made for or in respect of them, and he obtained her sexual services without any payment having been made for or in respect of them, and when he obtained her sexual services, he knew that her sexual services were being made available to him on the basis that payment will be made for or in respect of them, and he intended that payment will not be made, and by such manner of deception, he dishonestly induced her to deliver her sexual services to him, which she would not have done so had she not been so deceived. To date, the accused made no payment to V2.

26     By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has thereby committed an offence under Section 420A(1) and punishable under Section 420A(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

#### Facts relating to the 7th and 17th charge (DAC 923794-2021 and DAC 923804-2021)

27     The third victim, \[redacted\] (“V3”), was a 17-year-old Singaporean female. The fourth victim is \[redacted\] (“V4”), and the fifth victim is \[redacted\] (“V5”). They were also 17-year-old Singaporean females, acquainted with V3. V3 and V5 were students. V4 worked as a sales promoter and earned about S$500 per week.

28     V3 first got acquainted with the accused on 4 January 2021 after responding to his post on Locanto looking for a long-term “sugar girlfriend”, offering S$5,000 per month. The accused had frequently posted on Locanto to state that he was looking for a “sugar baby” and that he could provide financial help. Even though the accused knew he could not provide such a high allowance, he advertised a high allowance to “entice people” so that he could get more responses. He knew that V3-V5 would not have sex with him if they knew that he did not have the means to pay them in exchange for their sexual services.

29     V3 responded to his post because she needed financial assistance for her school fees. During their meeting, according to V3, the accused told her that he was working in the finance industry, lived in a condominium unit, and earned about S$50,000 to S$60,000 per month. He also mentioned about how he would indulge his ex-girlfriends by paying for their expenses and buying them expensive gifts. As such, he was willing to sponsor V3’s tuition fees at Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA) amounting to S$20,000 in exchange for her sexual services. According to V3, believing the accused, V3 agreed to have sex with him. According to V3, when they discussed about sex, V3 said that she would only engage in protected sex. The accused agreed and also assured her that he would take things slow and not force her into it. Right after the meeting, the accused invited V3 for a staycation, but she was not available. According to V3, he counter-proposed the following day and said that the deal was off if she could not make it, so V3 agreed. He said that he would deliver the money to her via bank transfer after 48 hours.

30     On 5 January 2021 at about 6 p.m., V3 arrived at D’Hotel located at 231 Outram Road, Singapore. The accused picked her up from the hotel drop-off and escorted her to Room 407 without asking her to check in at the hotel reception. He had booked a room earlier so that V3 need not check in at the hotel reception. According to V3, V3 rejected him and told him she was having her menses. The accused then reminded her that he was paying for her school fees, so she gave in, and they had unprotected penile-vaginal intercourse. After having sex, they had dinner in the room and V3 stayed over. The following morning, the accused woke V3 up to have unprotected sex again.

31     Before checking out of D’Hotel, the accused told V3 that he would pay her S$10,000 first instead of S$20,000, so that he could have more spare cash on hand, and he had already performed a future transfer of that amount to her on 10 January 2021. According to V3, V3 believed him. Before leaving, the accused asked V3 to lend him S$400 as he needed to lend a friend but had insufficient cash after performing the transfer to her. He promised to pay her back the next day, but he did not. According to V3, V3 agreed to lend him S$400 because she thought she would be receiving S$10,000 from him. On 10 January 2021 when V3 failed to see the amount in her bank account, the accused said that he got the date wrong and that it was supposed to be 11 January 2021. The following day, the accused said that he had cancelled the transaction because he needed the money, and he would write a cheque instead.

32     The day after, he told V3 he was going to withhold payment unless someone could keep him company. Every day, he gave excuses to V3 to delay payment till his arrest by the Police on 21 January 2021.

33     Prior to meeting V3, the accused was employed as a cleaner at a shopping mall and was drawing an average salary of less than S$2,000 per month. However, between early January and end February 2021, he was unemployed and did not draw any salary. He did not have any other sources of income. Even though the accused knew he could not afford to pay the high amounts he had advertised on Locanto, and had no intention to make such payment, he did it to entice responses. That was why he kept giving excuses to delay payment. The accused lied to V3 so that she would believe he was rich enough to be her ‘sugar daddy’ and give into his demands and provide him with sexual services. He also was unable to pay V3 S$20,000 or S$10,000 at any time and had no intention to do so. He told V3 that he had bought her a Chopard necklace to make her think that he was rich, but in truth he did not buy such a necklace. The accused and V3 had sexual intercourse twice.

34     To date, the accused has not made any payment to V3. Accordingly, the accused had obtained the sexual services from V3 dishonestly by deceiving her into believing that he would pay her a sum of S$20,000 for a long term sexual relationship with him, and her sexual services were made available to him on the basis that payment will be made for or in respect of them, and he obtained her sexual services without any payment having been made for or in respect of them, and when he obtained her sexual services, he knew that her sexual services were being made available to him on the basis that payment will be made for or in respect of them, and he intended that payment will not be made, and by such manner of deception, he dishonestly induced her to deliver her sexual services to him, which she would not have done so had she not been so deceived.

35     By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence under Section 420A(1) and punishable under Section 420A(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

36     After 5 January 2021, the accused kept asking V3 to meet but she was not available. The accused suggested to V3 to introduce her friends to keep him company instead since V3 was not free to meet him, and he said he was willing to pay S$800 to her friends for one night provided they provided him sexual services. Later, he offered to pay S$1,000. During the wee hours of 8 January 2021, when V3 told the accused over the phone that she could not find anyone to accompany him for the night, the accused was upset. He started shouting at V3 over the phone. The accused knew of V5 through V3 because V3 and V5 were very close friends. From his earlier conversation with V3, the accused also knew V5 was working as a social escort. The accused thus threatened to expose V5 as a social escort who provided sexual services to the Police so that she would “get into trouble with the law”; he would not do that if V3 asked V5 to transfer him S$500 as a loan. According to V3, as V3 was afraid of the repercussions on V5 including V5’s reputation, V3 decided to make the transfer of S$500 through PayNow to the accused on V5’s behalf without telling V5, as the means of avoiding execution of the accused’s threat. The accused later said that he would return the money to V3, along with the sum of S$10,000 he earlier promised to pay her. However, he never did.

37     The accused had threatened V3 with injury to the reputation of V5. By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 506 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

#### Facts relating to the 8th and 20th charge (DAC 923795-2021 and DAC 923807-2021)

38     In the afternoon of 8 January 2021, V3 messaged V4 and asked if she could meet the accused later that night to provide sexual services in exchange for S$1,000. V4 agreed and the accused booked a Grab ride for her that night to Robertson Quay Hotel located at 15 Merbau Road, Singapore.

39     Both of them met shortly before midnight at Robertson Quay Hotel. The accused picked her up outside and escorted her into Room 0810 without asking her to check in at the hotel reception. According to V4, the accused refused to use a condom as he said he would “feel better” without the condom. V4 was worried but relented because she needed the cash as she was a single mother. At that time, V4 had a 9-month-old baby son. The accused assured her that he would pay her, and money was not an issue. He told V4 that he would make payment through V3, but he knew that was a lie. The accused and V4 proceeded to have unprotected sex once that night and another time the following morning.

40     After waiting for three days, V4 did not receive her promised payment of S$1,000. She confronted the accused via WhatsApp, and he told her that he would pay her an extra S$100 to compensate for the delay in payment. V4 also complained to V3 about the delay and that she really needed the money. Hence, V3 transferred S$1,100 to V4 on 12 January 2021 out of her own pocket, thinking she would be reimbursed by the accused but that never materialised.

41     On the night of 20 January 2021 in Room 309 of Hotel 1887, the accused found out that V3 had transferred V4 money on his behalf. He was upset that V3 paid V4 on his behalf, because V3 had taken the money from her father. He got V3 to call V4 and he spoke to V4 in a loud and threatening manner, demanding her to return V3’s money or according to V4, he would look up her address and beat her and her baby up. He hurled vulgarities at her. The accused told V4 he would pay her in due course and not to take money from V3. According to V4, after that phone call, she was alarmed and so after the accused hang up, she asked V3 what to do. V3 told V4 to transfer S$500 to her immediately so that she could show the accused she had S$1,100 in her bank account as if V4 had returned the full amount. V3 had just over S$600 of her own money in her bank account at that time, so having V4 transfer S$500 to her would allow V3 to show the accused that she had over S$1,100 in her bank account and it would appear that V4 had transferred the money back. After convincing the accused, V3 transferred back V4 the said S$500.

42     To date, the accused made no payment to V4. The accused admitted that he could not afford to pay for V4’s sexual services and made excuses to delay payment. Accordingly, the accused had obtained the sexual services from V4 dishonestly by deceiving her into believing that he would pay her a sum of S$1,000 for sexual intercourse with him, and her sexual services were made available to him on the basis that payment will be made for or in respect of them, and he obtained her sexual services without any payment having been made for or in respect of them, and when he obtained her sexual services, he knew that her sexual services were being made available to him on the basis that payment will be made for or in respect of them, and he intended that payment will not be made, and by such manner of deception, he dishonestly induced her to deliver her sexual services to him, which she would not have done so had she not been so deceived. He also made threatening communication to V4, which caused V4 alarm. By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has thereby committed offences under Section 420A(1) and punishable under Section 420A(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed), and under Section 3(1)(b) punishable under Section 3(2) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A, 2015 Rev Ed).

_Facts relating to the 11th charge (DAC 923798-2021)_

43     After the accused told V3 that he would withhold the payment unless someone could keep him company, according to V3, V3 panicked and approached V5 on 13 January 2021. V3 told V5 that the accused said he was willing to pay V5 S$3,000 to keep him company and provide him sexual services. However, V5 did not want to spend the night alone with the accused, so V3 agreed to tag along. The accused booked them a Grab ride to Hotel Royal located at 36 Newton Road, Singapore.

44     The accused met V3 and V5 at Hotel Royal at around 11 p.m. that night and escorted them to Room 1118 without asking them to check in at the hotel reception. The accused promised to pay V5 S$3,000 in exchange for her providing him sexual services. At one point when V3 went to the toilet, the accused came onto V5, and they had unprotected sexual intercourse. According to V3, the accused refused to wear a condom. The following morning, the accused woke V5 up for unprotected sexual intercourse again. Halfway through, V5 told him to stop as it was painful for her. The accused stopped for a brief moment but asked her to try to continue. According to V5, he then inserted his penis into her vagina, causing her to scream out of pain. V3 then stopped him and told him not to have sex with V5, so the accused stopped. When V5 went to wash up, the accused asked V3 instead to have sexual intercourse with him. V3 was reluctant as she was still having her menses but eventually relented because the accused had not paid her any money and V3 was worried that the accused would not pay her if she refused. V5 came out of the toilet and saw the accused and V3 having unprotected sexual intercourse. According to V3, V3 stopped him after five minutes as she was in pain.

45     Before V3 and V5 left the room on 14 January 2021, the accused claimed that he would pay V5 S$3,000 through V3 by that afternoon but he did not do so. To date, the accused made no payment to V3 or V5. Accordingly, the accused had obtained the sexual services from V5 dishonestly by deceiving her into believing that he would pay her a sum of S$3,000 for a long term sexual relationship with him, and her sexual services were made available to him on the basis that payment will be made for or in respect of them, and he obtained her sexual services without any payment having been made for or in respect of them, and when he obtained her sexual services, he knew that her sexual services were being made available to him on the basis that payment will be made for or in respect of them, and he intended that payment will not be made, and by such manner of deception, he dishonestly induced her to deliver her sexual services to him, which she would not have done so had she not been so deceived. By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has thereby committed an offence under Section 420A(1) and punishable under Section 420A(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

46     In total, V3 introduced four of her friends to provide sexual services to him, which included V4 and V5. V3 did not benefit in any way from introducing her friends to the accused. She did so at the request of the accused. The accused never verified with any of them about their ages and did not ask to see their identification cards. The accused knew that he had no money to pay them. The accused had also borrowed at least S$2,500 from V3 because he needed cash for his personal expenses. To date, he has not returned any money to V3. The accused claimed that he was going to borrow money from his mother to pay V3, V4 and V5, to whom he owed a total of S$24,000 in exchange for them providing sexual services to him. However, to date, the accused has not paid any of them. The accused knew he was in financial difficulties but still led V3 and her friends on to provide sexual services to him because he was “having fun” and did not think about fulfilling his promises to them.

## Submissions on sentence

### Prosecution’s case

47     The Prosecution asked for at least 10 years of CT.[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22) Applying the Escalation principle, and running at least 3 sentences consecutively, the Accused’s global sentence was likely to be more than 10 years’ imprisonment:[^23]

### Mitigation plea

48     For the s 420A charges, the Defence argued that both the harm and culpability were low.[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24) For these offences, the amount cheated should be based on the actual value cheated rather than the purported value.[^25]

49     The Defence sought a regular imprisonment term. A CT sentence should not be imposed for two main reasons:

> (a)     It would be disproportionate given the level of criminality of the Accused’s present offences.[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26)

> (b)     The Accused’s best opportunity for rehabilitation and reintegration into society is not CT, but a regular imprisonment term, coupled with a post-release support network. Given the specific risk factors highlighted in the Pre-Sentencing Report for Corrective Training, a CT sentence would ironically have a contrary impact on him.[\[note: 27\]](#Ftn_27)

50     The Defence sought a global sentence with a starting point of not more than 2 years and 5 months,[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28) with the total sentence not being more than 4 years’ imprisonment.[^29]

## Issues to be determined

### Framework in Sim Yeow Kee

51     The two-stage framework in _Sim Yeow Kee v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 936</span> is as follows:

> (I)      Stage 1: Whether the offender qualifies for the CT regime under s 304(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (“CPC”).

> (II)      Stage 2: Whether it is expedient to sentence the offender to CT with a view to his reformation and the prevention of crime. For Stage 2, there is a 3-step process:

>> (a)       Step 1: What are the likely imprisonment sentences?

>> (b)       Step 2: Would the offender be placed on the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme (“MAS”)?

>> (c)       Step 3: Would a sentence of CT be unduly disproportionate?

52     Briefly, my answer is ‘Yes’ to both stages.

53     At its heart, the above framework balances various sentencing principles – crime prevention, proportionality, totality and the reformation and rehabilitation of offenders (for a historical overview of CT, see Chan Wing Cheong, _Preventive Detention and Corrective Training for Habitual Offenders in Singapore_, 8 Sing. Ac. L.J. 157 at 165-167).

### Stage 1: Does the offender qualify for Corrective Training?

54     Yes, the Accused qualified for Corrective Training under s 304(1) of the CPC.[\[note: 30\]](#Ftn_30) This is a threshold question.

### Stage 2: Is it expedient to sentence the offender to CT with a view to his reformation and the prevention of crime?

#### (a)   Step 1: What are the likely imprisonment sentences?

##### (1)   Prescribed punishment

55     The prescribed punishment for

> (a)     s 420 Cap 224 is imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and the offender shall also be liable to a fine;

> (b)     s 420A Cap 224 is imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years, or to fine, or to both;

> (c)     s 506 Cap 224 is imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with both;

> (d)     s 3(1)(b) POHA is a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both.

56     An offence’s statutory maximum sentence signals the gravity in which Parliament views such offences. A sentencing judge ought to take this into account when determining precisely where the offender’s conduct falls within the entire range of punishment set by Parliament: _Public Prosecutor v Kwong Kok Hing_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 2 SLR(R) 684</span> at \[44\] (Benny Tan, _Assessing the Effectiveness of Sentencing Guideline Judgments in Singapore Issued Post-March 2013 and A Guide to Constructing Frameworks_, <span class="citation">(2018) 30 SAcLJ 1004</span> at \[46\]).

57     The court should ensure that the full spectrum of sentences enacted by Parliament is carefully explored in determining the appropriate sentence, _viz._ Completeness principle: _Poh Boon Kiat v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 892</span> at \[60\] and _Takaaki Masui v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 265</span> at \[152\]-\[154\].

##### (2)   Harm, culpability & mitigating/ aggravating factors

58     The interplay of harm, culpability, mitigating and aggravating factors lends itself well to sentencing.

59     Harm is a measure of the injury that has been caused to society by the commission of the offence: _Public Prosecutor v Koh Thiam Huat_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 1099</span> at \[41\].

60     Culpability is a measure of the degree of relative blameworthiness disclosed by an offender’s actions and is measured chiefly in relation to the extent and manner of the offender’s involvement in the criminal act: _Public Prosecutor v Aw Tai Hock_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 1141</span> at \[35\].

61     I was mindful that in assessing the level of harm or potential harm, the sentencing court should be careful not to double-count any factors which may already have been taken into account in assessing the level of culpability: _Neo Ah Luan v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 1153</span> at \[70\] (see also Andrew Ashworth, _Sentencing and Criminal Justice_ (6th Edition, 2015, Cambridge University Press) at \[4.3\] and \[4.5\]).

62      Plea of Guilt and Cooperation with Authorities. I gave due weight to the Accused’s plea of guilt and cooperation with the authorities: _Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 653</span> at \[77\].[^31] This saved the criminal justice system resources that would have been expended with a full trial. Importantly, it spared the victims from having to testify: _Logachev Vladislav v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 609</span> at \[67\]-\[68\] and _Ng Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 449</span> at \[69\].

63      TIC Charges. The effect of taking into consideration outstanding charges is to enhance the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed for the proceeded charges: s 148(1) of the CPC. In the present case, 13 charges were taken into consideration for sentencing purposes.

64      Antecedents. The Accused’s criminal record, excluding the present offences, spans 24 pages. The Accused has many dishonesty-related antecedents, with their genesis in 1999. In 2005 and 2013, he was convicted of cheating, theft and criminal breach of trust. For his 2005 conviction, the Accused was sentenced to a total of 8 years’ imprisonment. For his 2013 conviction, he was sentenced to 7 years of CT.[\[note: 32\]](#Ftn_32)

##### (3)   Escalation principle

65     The Escalation principle is no more than a reformulation of the longstanding principle that specific deterrence may justify a longer imprisonment term being imposed on a persistent offender in light of his antecedents, if these reflected a tendency for repeat offending or a marked proclivity toward criminal offending: _Public Prosecutor v Low Ji Qing_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 769</span> at \[56\].

66     The appropriateness of escalation requires a scrupulous assessment of the particular factual matrix: _Tan Kay Beng v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 10</span> at \[34\]. This is by no means a mechanical exercise. The court is required to assess whether the objective of preventing re-offending is in fact met by the use of escalation: _Low Ji Qing_ at \[66\].

67     Applying the Escalation principle incorporates the safeguard of proportionality. Hence, before a court imposes an uplift on an accused person’s previous sentences, there must be a careful comparison with his previous offending: _Low Ji Qing_ at \[74\].

68     In order to have the correct factual basis for applying the Escalation principle, in addition to the Criminal Records Office record, it might sometimes be helpful or necessary to refer to, among other things, the charges, statement of facts, psychiatric reports, and grounds of decision (where available). It is not every case where this will be called for – but certainly where the Escalation principle is in play, a court should endeavour to have as complete a picture as practicable: _Low Ji Qing_ at \[76\].

69     In this connection, I considered the charges and statement of facts pertaining to the Accused’s antecedents in 2005 and 2013.

70     Ultimately, the assessment for the Escalation principle is necessarily a fact-specific and contextual one, requiring a judgment of experience and discernment: _Low Ji Qing_ at \[81\].

71     The Accused had committed various dishonesty-related offences with a similar _modus operandi_. In 2005 and 2013, he was convicted of cheating, theft and CBT offences perpetrated on female victims. He befriended female victims online and deceived them into giving him money in return for non-existent jobs and loans.[\[note: 33\]](#Ftn_33)

72     For his offences for which he was convicted in 2005, he faced a total of 54 charges, of which 17 charges were proceeded with. The Accused dialled up local chat lines, which offered free voicemail box account for ladies to post a profile of themselves, to look for potential victims. He promised his victims monetary rewards if they agreed to be his ‘uncommitted lover’. He also deceived some of them to be his workers to help him ‘transfer’ funds to his workers’ bank accounts. He would entice them with cash cheques of a substantial figure or promise to give them loans if they transferred money to his bank account first. All such cheques were dishonoured. He would also post messages on Yahoo! Message boards to befriend victims and deceive them in a similar manner. In total, he deceived 26 victims of $120,453. No restitution was made.[\[note: 34\]](#Ftn_34)

73     For these offences for which he was convicted in 2005, the Accused was sentenced to a total of 8 years’ imprisonment. He was released from prison in September 2009 and was placed on the Home Detention Scheme which he completed in September 2010. He reoffended in December 2010 and continued to commit 59 offences in the next two years.[\[note: 35\]](#Ftn_35)

74     For his offences in 2010-2012, he faced a total of 59 charges. The Accused browsed the internet (e.g. gumtree.com.sg; craigslist.com) to identify his victims. He preyed on females looking for a job and told them that he was hiring a personal assistant. He would bring them to a fancy restaurant or café for an interview, arriving in a hired luxury car or limousine driven by a hired chauffeur to fetch the victims. Subsequently, he would ask the victims for loans with a promise to repay them, which he never did. He would also offer other victims loans. However, he would ask for a fee or deposit before giving them the loans. The victims were deceived to transfer him money. He would also tell some victims that he was looking for a girlfriend and was willing to pay a high monthly allowance.[\[note: 36\]](#Ftn_36)

75     The total amount involved in these offences was more than $124,000. No restitution was made. He was sentenced to 7 years’ CT, with effect from 18 February 2013.[\[note: 37\]](#Ftn_37)

76     After being released from prison on 17 February 2020, within less than a year, the Accused re-offended, which found expression in the present set of offences.[\[note: 38\]](#Ftn_38)

77     Here, while the number of charges and total amount cheated were lower than his convictions in 2005 and 2013,[\[note: 39\]](#Ftn_39) he obtained sexual services from girls as young as 17 without making any payment through deception.[^40] His offences now also included criminal intimidation under s 506 of the Penal Code. And he threatened a 17-year old victim (that he would beat her and her baby up), an offence under s 3(1)(b) of POHA. Taken together, these points militated in favour of the Escalation principle applying.[^41]

78     My view is fortified by his Pre-Sentencing Report for Corrective Training, which reads:

> (a)     “Despite repeated incarcerations of increasingly longer durations for his offences (i.e. from long sentence in 2005 to corrective training in 2012), Chip Huat presented with little remorse and continued to cheat victims, even after having been arrested and placed on bail (e.g. in 2003 and 2021)”,[\[note: 42\]](#Ftn_42) and

> (b)     “More recently, Chip Huat’s offending behaviour shifted towards cheating for the purpose of soliciting sexual services, in addition to getting fast cash”.[\[note: 43\]](#Ftn_43)

79     I turn first to his s 420A Cap 224 charges. The Criminal Law Reform Act 2019 (No. 15 of 2019)[\[note: 44\]](#Ftn_44) introduced s 420A. The provenance of s 420A can be traced to the similar offence of “obtaining services dishonestly” in the United Kingdom’s Fraud Act 2006 at s 11 (see also the Penal Code Review Committee Report (August 2018) at pages 4, 48-49) (see generally, Stanley Yeo, Neil Morgan and Chan Wing Cheong, _Criminal Law in Malaysia and Singapore_ (LexisNexis, Third Ed, 2018) at \[13.22\]-\[13.31\]). There did not appear to be equivalent offence provisions in Australia, New Zealand or Malaysia. Section 420A was not specifically mentioned during the parliamentary debates: see second reading of the Criminal Law Reform Bill \[_Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (6 May 2019) vol. 94\].

80     For the s 420A offences, the amount cheated should _not_ be the sole consideration or touchstone. I preferred to regard the amount cheated as one factor that goes towards the broader question of the harm caused by the offence (see also _Logachev_ at \[43\]).

81     To my mind, there are four reasons for this (see also _Public Prosecutor v Abdul Rahman Bin A Karim_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 72</span> at \[65\]-\[66\]):

> (a)     The “damage or harm” may not be capable of being clearly defined; damage or harm may sometimes be _intangible_ when it assumes the form of inconvenience, embarrassment, or loss of reputation (Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts (Third Edition: Volume I, LexisNexis, 2013) at page 836). This point is brought to sharp focus when a “victim is deceived into providing a service for (an) accused person at no measurable cost to the victim” (Penal Code Review Committee Report (August 2018) at pages 4 and 48).

> (b)     Singling out the amount cheated has the potential to divert attention away from other relevant sentencing considerations that go towards the _harm_ caused by the offence punishable under s 420A(2): _Logachev_ at \[44\].

> (c)     Singling out the amount cheated also has the potential to divert attention away from the relevant sentencing considerations that go towards the offender’s _culpability_: _Logachev_ at \[47\]-\[48\].

> (d)     Having the amount cheated as the sole factor in determining the sentence is monochromatic — it constrains the court’s ability to give effect holistically to the four general principles of retribution, deterrence, prevention and rehabilitation during sentencing (see also _Amir Hamzah bin Berang Kuty v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 1 SLR(R) 617</span> at \[60\]).

82     For his s 420A offences, I agreed with the Prosecution that the harm was moderate to high:[\[note: 45\]](#Ftn_45)

> (a)     The amount cheated is one factor that goes towards the broader question of the harm caused by the offence. All other things being equal, a higher amount cheated should lead to a higher sentence: _Abdul Rahman Bin A Karim_ at \[64\]-\[65\]. The amounts involved ranged up to $20,000.[\[note: 46\]](#Ftn_46) The total sum involved for the proceeded charges was $46,145.36.[^47] The total sum involved for all the charges (proceeded and TIC) for 10 female victims was $72,245.36.[^48]

> (b)     The Accused had unprotected sex[\[note: 49\]](#Ftn_49) with all victims, which increased the risk of spreading sexual diseases: _BPH v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 2 SLR 764</span> at \[61\] and _BSR v Public Prosecutor and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 2 SLR 758</span> at \[14\].[^50]

> (c)     V2 was a social escort and a sex worker. The courts have considered sex workers to be vulnerable, given their reluctance to come forward when offences are committed against them, for fear of compromising their illicit activities: _Public Prosecutor v Mohammad Al-Ansari bin Basri_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 449</span> at \[84\] (see also the Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts (Third Edition: Volume I, LexisNexis, 2013) at page 834).[^51]

> (d)     The Accused ill-treated the victims. For example, halfway during sex with V5, V5 told him to stop as it was painful for her; he stopped for a brief moment but asked her to try to continue — he then inserted his penis into V5’s vagina, causing her to scream out of pain.[\[note: 52\]](#Ftn_52) Against this backdrop, I did not agree with the Defence’s submission that the Accused did not ill-treat the victims.[^53]

83     For his s 420A Cap 224 charges, I agreed with the Prosecution that the culpability was medium:[\[note: 54\]](#Ftn_54)

> (a)     The Accused’s acts were planned and premeditated.[\[note: 55\]](#Ftn_55)

> (b)     He had sex with young victims (including 17-year old girls) and deceived them by making various promises, including that he would pay for their tuition fees.[\[note: 56\]](#Ftn_56) The girls were about one-third of the Accused’s age. Given their tender age, they were more likely to be manipulated by his machinations.

> (c)     His acts spanned a period of about 8 months (January to August 2021) and targeted various victims, and were not a one-off offence.[\[note: 57\]](#Ftn_57)

> (d)     He exploited the internet (e.g. Locanto),[\[note: 58\]](#Ftn_58) which generally increases the culpability associated with an offence because it acts as a powerful multiplier allowing an offender to reach out to a larger pool of potential victims: _Poh Boon Kiat_ at \[94\], _Public Prosecutor v Quek Chin Choon_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 1 SLR 1169</span> at \[38\], and _Koo Kah Yee v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 261</span> at \[62\] (see also Kow Keng Siong, _Sentencing Principles in Singapore_ (Academy Publishing, Second Ed, 2019) at 16.040).

84     In the circumstances, sentences of between 3 years to 4 years 9 months were appropriate for the s 420A offences.

85     I turn next to the s 420 Cap 224 charge.[\[note: 59\]](#Ftn_59) Given the amount involved (S$11,645.36), the precedents such as _Public Prosecutor v Ngooi Chee Hsien_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGDC 265</span>_, Public Prosecutor Kwek Ling Ling_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGDC 56</span> and _Public Prosecutor v Ho Chi Wai_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGDC 317</span>, and the Accused’s property-related antecedents, I agreed with the Prosecution that a sentence of one year was appropriate.[^60]

86     For the s 506 Cap 224 charge,[\[note: 61\]](#Ftn_61) I found _Tay We-Jin v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] SGDC 220</span> to be relevant, where the offender was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment. The facts in _Tay We-Jin_ were more egregious as the offender sent numerous messages threatening to expose the promiscuous lifestyle of the 16-year-old victim to her family and her school unless she allowed him to become her pimp. The offender also drafted a contract to the effect that she was in no way forced or induced by him into providing the sexual services.

87     In the present case, the Accused had threatened a 17-year old victim with injury to reputation of her close friend, by shouting at the victim over the phone that he would expose her close friend as a social escort who provided sexual services so that she would “get into trouble with the law”, and demanding the victim to deliver a S$500 loan to him as the means of avoiding execution of such threat. The appropriate sentence for this charge was 6 months’ imprisonment.

88     For the s 3(1)(b) POHA charge,[\[note: 62\]](#Ftn_62) given his threat to look up the 17-year old victim’s address and beat her and her baby up, thereby causing her alarm, and the precedents such as _Public Prosecutor v Mok Wai Lun Calvin_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 306</span> and _Ye Lin Myint v Public Prosecutor_ \[2019\] SLR 1005, I agreed with the Prosecution that a sentence of 3 months was appropriate.[^63]

89     In the present case, 3 custodial sentences should run consecutively. This is because there were multiple victims, the Accused is a persistent offender as seen by his recalcitrant behaviour and the fact that he is facing many charges, and there is a pressing public interest in discouraging the present offences: _ADF v Public Prosecutor & Anor_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 1 SLR 874</span> at \[146\].

90     All things considered, the Accused’s likely sentence would be imprisonment for a period of about 9 years, as detailed in the table below.

#### (b)   Step 2: Would the accused be placed on the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme (MAS)?

91     The Prosecution submitted that the Accused does not qualify for the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme (“MAS”).[\[note: 64\]](#Ftn_64) I agreed.

#### (c)   Step 3: Would a sentence of CT be unduly disproportionate?

92     For the balancing exercise in _Sim Yeow Kee_, two considerations (rehabilitative benefits of the MAS and whether CT would be unduly disproportionate) bear weight to a greater degree when a shorter term of CT is contemplated: _Sim Yeow Kee_ at \[17(d)\] and \[105\]-\[106\]. The 3-Judge Panel in _Sim Yeow Kee_ recognised that its sentencing framework is likely to reduce the scope for imposing CT sentences (at \[105\]).

93     The Accused’s likely sentence would be about 9 years’ imprisonment. The Accused does not qualify for the MAS.

94     In my judgment, having applied the first two steps under Stage 2, I found that a sentence of regular imprisonment twinned with the MAS would not adequately fulfil the dual aims of specifically deterring and rehabilitating the Accused (_Sim Yeow Kee_ at \[114\]).

95     The Accused’s Pre-Sentencing Report for Corrective Training reads:

> (a)     “Despite repeated incarcerations of increasingly longer durations for his offences (i.e. from long sentence in 2005 to corrective training in 2012), Chip Huat presented with little remorse and continued to cheat victims, even after having been arrested and placed on bail (e.g. in 2003 and 2021)”.[\[note: 65\]](#Ftn_65)

> (b)     “Based on Singapore’s norms, Chip Huat’s LS/CMI score places him in the Moderate Risk/Need level of criminal re-offending. He belongs to a group of prisoners with a 30.0% probability of recidivism within 2 years of release”.[\[note: 66\]](#Ftn_66)

> (c)     “More recently, Chip Huat’s offending behaviour shifted towards cheating for the purpose of soliciting sexual services, in addition to getting fast cash… Taking it all together, Chip Huat’s offending behaviours were underscored by several antisocial attitudes such as his persistent disregard for the law, lack of consequential thinking, and justification of his behaviours as a means of meeting his various needs”.[\[note: 67\]](#Ftn_67)

96     I considered that imposing CT for 9 years would not be unduly disproportionate.

97      Totality Principle. The sentence is in line with the totality principle: _Mohamed Shouffee Bin Adam_.[\[note: 68\]](#Ftn_68)

98      Aggregation Principle. I bore in mind that in the same way the Aggregation principle applies such that a longer sentence has a compounding effect that applies in a more than linear fashion, committing multiple criminal acts may be said to illustrate a more than linear relationship with the offender’s criminality. Each assessment of criminality will have to fall on its own facts, and the Aggregation principle should not be unthinkingly relied on to assist the offender: _Wong Tian Jun De Beers v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 273</span> at \[70(e)\].

99      Proportionality Principle. I kept in mind the proportionality principle in sentencing: _Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> at \[30\]. Under the proportionality principle, the sentence to be imposed must not only bear a reasonable proportion to the maximum prescribed penalty, but also to the gravity of the offence committed (Kow Keng Siong, _Sentencing Principles in Singapore_ (Academy Publishing, Second Ed, 2019) at \[06.091\]-\[06.093\]) (see also Ho Hsi Ming Shawn, _The Centrality of Proportionality: A Golden Thread in Sentencing_, Singapore Law Gazette (July 2020)).

## Conclusion

### Summary

100    A summary of my Grounds of Decision is as follows:

> (a)      First Stage: The Accused qualified for the CT regime (at \[54\]).

> (b)      Second Stage:

>> (i)       The likely imprisonment sentence is about 9 years (at \[55\] to \[90\]).

>> (ii)       The Accused does not qualify for the MAS (at \[91\]).

>> (iii)       A sentence of CT would not be unduly disproportionate (at \[92\] to \[99\]).

101    All things considered, the Accused was sentenced to 9 years of CT. He is currently serving his sentence.

102    I am deeply grateful to both the Prosecution and the Defence for their comprehensive and helpful submissions.
