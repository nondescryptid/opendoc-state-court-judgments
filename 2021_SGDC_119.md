### District Judge Seah Chi-Ling:

## Introduction

1       The present case arose out of a motor accident on Bukit Timah Expressway (“**BKE**”) involving the Plaintiff’s motorcycle and the Defendant’s motor vehicle. The Defendant’s motor vehicle had earlier collided with another vehicle, causing the Defendant’s vehicle to overturn and come to a stop on the right most lane of the expressway. The Defendant’s vehicle remained in that position for some 10 minutes, before the Plaintiff’s motorcycle approached and collided into the Defendant’s overturned motor vehicle. The Defendant sought to absolve himself completely by arguing that the Plaintiff’s act of colliding into his overturned vehicle constituted a _novus actus interveniens_.

## Background Facts

2       At the time of the accident, the Plaintiff was 32 years of age and worked as a delivery driver. The Defendant was 26 years of age, and was a camp instructor in an outdoor adventure company.

3       On 2 December 2016, at 1.30 am, the Plaintiff was riding FT 1190B (the “**Plaintiff’s Motorcycle**”) along the BKE when it was involved in a collision with motor vehicle SJE 4108C (the “**Defendant’s Vehicle**”) which had been driven by the Defendant. As a result of the collision, the Plaintiff lost consciousness and was conveyed in an ambulance to the hospital. The Plaintiff could not remember any details of the events leading up to his collision with the Defendant’s Vehicle.

4       In a Report of a Traffic Accident (“**Police Report**”) made by the Defendant to the police on 2 December 2016 at 9:35 pm[^1], the Defendant stated that he was driving along the third lane of the BKE at the material time. All lane references in these written grounds are numbered with reference to the right edge of the road as the starting point. Somewhere before the Mandai Exit, an unidentified vehicle in front of the Defendant’s Vehicle jammed brake. To avoid a collision, the Defendant swerved to the right, _i.e._ onto the second lane. Thereupon, he lost control of his vehicle, and automatically swerved back to the third lane and collided with a third vehicle (the “**Third Vehicle**”) to his left on the third lane. He then swerved straight towards the first lane and hit the metal kerb on the right of the expressway, causing his car to flip a few times and finally coming to rest in an overturned position on the BKE. Defendant was stuck inside his vehicle. He later managed to get out of his vehicle and sat along the road shoulder. He was assisted by some road users. While he was waiting by the road shoulder for the ambulance, the Plaintiff’s Motorcycle came along and collided with his overturned vehicle.

5       In his trial affidavit[^2], the Defendant further elaborated that he was travelling at about 70-80 kmph and keeping about 2-3 car lengths behind the unidentified vehicle that had jammed brake. After his car collided into the metal kerb on the right of the expressway, it had overturned a few times, and came to a stop on the _second lane_ of the expressway[^3]. He claimed he was hanging upside down in his overturned vehicle for about 1-2 minutes as his seat belt was fastened. He was however conscious throughout. Thereafter he managed to get out of the vehicle by himself after checking for traffic. Some passers-by then came to assist him and he proceeded to sit at the left road shoulder. The passers-by who assisted him also assisted to control the traffic. About 10 minutes later, the Plaintiff’s Motorcycle came at a “very fast” speed[^4] and collided into his overturned vehicle which was stationary on the second lane from the right. He claimed his hazard lights were blinking, likely because his airbags had been deployed[^5]. No barriers were set up by him or the passers-by, but he recalled the passers-by were using torchlights and handphones to direct traffic[^6].

#### DW1 Dol Patah Bin Md Aris’ testimony

6       DW1 Dol Patah Bin Md Aris (“**DW1**”) was the driver of the Third Car on the third lane which the Defendant had collided into when he lost control of his vehicle, before manoeuvring right and hitting the metal kerb and overturning. DW1 was subpoenaed as the Defendant’s witness at trial.

7       DW1’s testimony matched Defendant’s testimony in most aspects, save for the following:

> (i)     DW1 testified that the Defendant’s Vehicle came to a rest predominantly in the _first lane_ of the expressway.

> (ii)     The Defendant was semi-conscious in the overturned vehicle. When DW1 tried to wake him up by knocking on his window, Defendant was not responsive. DW1 then opened the vehicle door and shook the Defendant, and it was then that the Defendant regained consciousness. DW1 then assisted him to sit at the left road shoulder as he was in shock[^7].

> (iii)     When DW1 went to assist Defendant, he noticed that two Chinese men had stopped their vehicle by the left road shoulder and were assisting to direct traffic using the light from their handphones from behind the Defendant’s overturned motor vehicle[^8]. However, at trial, DW1 clarified that the two Chinese men were not directing traffic from behind the Defendant’s overturned vehicle throughout; at the time the Plaintiff collided into the Defendant’s Vehicle, the two Chinese men had moved back to the road shoulder already and were directing traffic from that area.

## Plaintiff’s case

8       When the Plaintiff regained consciousness, he was in the Intensive Care Unit of Khoo Teck Puat Hospital. He sustained multiple, including facial injuries consisting of a fracture of the right maxillary sinus and a fracture of the right zygomatic arch.

9       Plaintiff could not remember any details of the accident. He chose to rely on the Defendant’s Police Report as proof of the contents therein pursuant to section 79 of the Evidence Act (Cap. 97, 1997 Rev ed) in the present action. Plaintiff submitted that the Defendant had been negligent in causing his motor vehicle to come to a stationary position on the right lane of the expressway in view of the following:

> (i)     The Defendant had driven in a careless manner when he drove too close of the vehicle ahead of him (the unidentified vehicle), such that when the said vehicle jammed brake, the Defendant had to swerve to the second lane to avoid a collision. This in turn caused the Defendant to lose control of his vehicle.

> (ii)     The Defendant’s loss of control of his vehicle led to him swerving back left into the third lane and colliding into DW1’s vehicle on the third lane, before swerving right to the first lane and hitting the metal kerb on the right, causing his vehicle to overturn a few times before coming to a rest.

> (iii)     Defendant had caused his motor vehicle to overturn and come to a stationary position on the BKE. This posed a danger to oncoming traffic, which materialised when the Plaintiff’s Motorcycle collided into his overturned vehicle.

## Defendant’s case

10     The Defendant conceded that he was “negligent in colliding with DW1’s vehicle such that the Defendant’s Vehicle overturned and \[became\] stationary on the BKE”: see Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para \[4\]. He agreed that the was travelling too close to the unidentified car, such then when the unidentified car braked, he had to swerve suddenly, causing him to lose control of his vehicle[^9]. The Defendant, nonetheless, submitted he should not be liable in any way for the Plaintiff’s loss, since the Plaintiff’s own conduct had eclipsed the Defendant’s wrongdoing and constituted a _novus actus_ such that the Plaintiff’s own conduct should be found to be the sole and effective cause of his injuries.

11     In arguing that the Plaintiff solely caused or contributed to his injury, the Defendant averred as follows:

> (i)     The Plaintiff, riding the Plaintiff’s Motorcycle, had collided into the Defendant’s overturned vehicle which was stationary and unoccupied at that time;

> (ii)     The Plaintiff was riding very fast when the Plaintiff’s Motorcycle collided into Defendant’s overturned vehicle;

> (iii)     The Defendant’s Vehicle’s Hazard Lights were switched on;

> (iv)     The Defendant’s overturned vehicle was stationary for at least 10 minutes before the Plaintiff’s Motorcycle collided into it;

> (v)     Passers-by were assisting to control traffic at the accident location. Specifically, there were up to two Chinese passers-by guiding traffic from behind the Defendant’s overturned vehicle using lights from the handphone and/or torches up to the time the Plaintiff collided into the Defendant’s overturned vehicle. If the Plaintiff had been travelling slower or had been more alert, he would have seen the overturned car and avoided it in time.

12     In summary, the Defendant argued that the Plaintiff had failed to maintain a reasonable look out and collided into the Defendant’s Vehicle which had over-turned for some time on a well-lit Singapore highway and which was not obscured by other moving vehicles and where passers-by had stopped to assist to direct traffic. Defendant submitted that the circumstances leading to the over-turning of the Defendant’s Vehicle was a separate chain of causation from the Plaintiff colliding into the Defendant’s over-turned vehicle; the Plaintiff was accordingly the sole cause of his own injuries and loss.

## The issues

13     The trial before me was bifurcated. The two issues before me were as follows:

> (i)     First, whether the Plaintiff’s act of colliding into the Defendant’s Vehicle some ten minutes after the Defendant’s Vehicle had overturned amounted to a _novus actus interveniens_, so as to break the chain of causation between the Defendant’s negligence (which led to Defendant’s Vehicle overturning) and the Plaintiff’s subsequent act of colliding into the Defendant’s overturned vehicle?

> (ii)     In the event the first question is answered in the negative, given that the Defendant had conceded that he was negligent in causing his vehicle to overturn (see \[10\] above), what should the apportionment of liability between the Plaintiff and Defendant be? Put in a different way, what is the extent of contributory negligence of the Plaintiff towards his own loss, if any?

### Novus Actus Interveniens

#### Whether novus actus interveniens adequately pleaded

14     The Plaintiff raised a preliminary objection to the raising of an argument based on _novus actus interveniens_ by the Defendant on the basis that it was not pleaded by the Defendant at all. Plaintiff submitted that the Defendant was precluded from raising the argument by reason of Order 18 Rule 8(1) of the Rules of Court, which states that “\[a\] party must in any pleading subsequent to a statement of claim plead specifically any matter, for example, performance, release, any relevant statute of limitation, fraud or any fact showing illegality — (a) which he alleges makes any claim or defence of the opposite party not maintainable; (b) which, if not specifically pleaded, might take the opposite party by surprise; or (c) which raises issues of fact not arising out of the preceding pleading.

15     Having reviewed the Defence, I was not persuaded that the Defendant was precluded from raising arguments based on _novus actus interveniens_. It is trite law that it is sufficient for a party to plead the material facts upon which it relies without stating the legal result or the legal outcome: see _Pinsler, Supreme Court Practice 2017_ at \[18/74\].

16     At paragraphs 2 and 4 of the Defence, the Defendant had adequately pleaded the material facts in support of his argument of _novus actus interveniens_. The Defendant pleaded as follows:

> “2.    The Defendant _denies_ that the said collision _was caused by any negligence on his part_ as alleged or at all.

> 4.    The Defendant avers that the said collision _was caused solely and/or contributed to by the negligence of the Plaintiff_ in the riding and management of the Plaintiff’s Motorcycle.”

> _\[Emphasis added\]_

17     In any event, it was clear that contributory negligence was specifically pleaded by the Defendant. In _PlanAssure PAC (formerly known as Patrick Lee PCA) v Gaelic Inns Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR 513</span> (“_PlanAssure_”), the Court of Appeal opined that the concept of contributory negligence is wide enough to embrace a situation where it is alleged that contributory negligence has caused the causal links to be broken. The Court of Appeal noted at \[99\]:

> “In the first place, we are not prepared to confine the role of contributory negligence solely to the quantum of damages. _In our view, contributory negligence has a wider role and embrace which may extend to negate causation._ It is established law that contributory negligence on the part of a plaintiff can operate to break the causal chain. We can do no better than to adopt the views expressed in Clerk and Lindsell on Torts (\[48\] supra) at para 2-96 that:

>> When the conduct of the claimant exacerbates, or adds to the injuries, of which he complains, that conduct will generally result in a reduction of his damages on grounds of _contributory negligence_, or failure in his duty to mitigate damage. However it may be that the conduct of the claimant is so _wholly unreasonable and/or of such overwhelming impact that that conduct eclipses the defendant’s wrongdoing and constitutes a novus actus_. His own conduct is found to be the effective cause of his injury.”

> _\[Emphasis added\]_

18     As paragraphs 2 and 4 of the Defence now stand, I therefore find Defendant was not precluded from raising the _novus actus interveniens_ argument.

#### Whether chain of causation broken

19     There are 2 limbs in establishing causation in the law of negligence – causation in fact and causation in law – see _Sunny Metal & Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng Khim Ming Eric_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 3 SLR(R) 782</span> at \[52\] (“_Sunny Metal_”).

20     Causation in fact is based on the _“but for”_ test. As the Court of Appeal noted in _Sunny Metal_ at \[52\]:

> “\[c\]ausation in fact is concerned with the question of whether the relation between the defendant’s breach of duty and the claimant’s damage is one of cause and effect in accordance with scientific or objective notions of physical sequence. It is concerned with establishing the physical connection between the defendant’s wrong and the claimant’s damage. The universally accepted test in this regard is the “but for” test”.

21     In the present case, the Defendant admitted during trial that it was his act of negligence which resulted in his vehicle overturning and resting partially in the first and the second lane of the expressway, and that this posed a danger to oncoming traffic: see \[10\] above. Here, “_but for”_ the Defendant’s negligence which resulted in his vehicle overturning and causing an obstruction in the first and second lanes of the expressway, the accident involving Plaintiff would not have occurred. The “_but for_” test is satisfied.

22     Causation in law, on the other hand, examines the nature and degree of the causal connection, and asks whether, “because of convenience, public policy, of a rough sense of justice, liability due to a series of events should be traced beyond a certain point…. It is not logic, but practical politics”. Thus, in _Sunny Metal_, the Court of Appeal noted at \[54\]:

> “….. \[s\]ometimes, the defendant’s conduct sets off a sequence of events, each one of which is a necessary link in the causal chain between the initial wrong and the claimant’s damage. _In such cases, the court has to determine whether any of the intervening events can be said to be so significant causally as to break the causal link to be regarded as a novus actus interveniens._ There is usually no dispute as to what in fact happened to cause the claimant’s damage; rather the question is which event will be treated as the cause for the purpose of attributing legal responsibility. The court therefore has to decide whether the defendant’s wrongful conduct constituted the “legal cause” of the damage. This recognizes that causes assume significance to the extent that they assist the court in deciding how best to attribute responsibility for the claimant’s damage …... _In effect, as Andrews J quite candidly put it in Palsgraf v The Long Island Railroad Company 248 NY 339 (1928) at 352: \[B\]ecause of convenience, of public policy, of a rough sense of justice, the law arbitrarily declines to trace a series of events beyond a certain point. This is not logic. It is practical politics._”

> _\[Emphasis added\]_

#### Foreseeability

23     Various tests and expressions have been employed to describe what would constitute a _novus actus interveniens_. As a starting point, it has been observed that “if the intervening act or omission in question is “_foreseeable_”, it is unlikely for it to be treated as a _novus actus interveniens_”: see Gary Chan, _The Law of Torts in Singapore (Academy Publishing, 2016 ed)_ at \[07.072\] (“_Gary Chan_”).

#### Unreasonableness

24     Further, where it is the plaintiff’s own acts that allegedly constitutes the _novus actus interveniens_, the enquiry is often on the extent of the “_unreasonable conduct_ that is sufficient to break the chain of causation” Gary Chan \[at 07.085\].

#### Recklessness / deliberateness

25     The Court of Appeal in _PlanAssure_, on the other hand, seemed to have accepted, in the context of personal injuries and property damage claims, that the plaintiff must have acted _recklessly or deliberately_ in order for the chain of causation to be broken. Unreasonable conduct _per se_ does not amount to recklessness of deliberate acts. The Court of Appeal noted at \[100\]:

> “100. However, the facts of this case do not fall within the four corners of the situation envisaged by the editors of _Clerk and Lindsell on Torts_. In taking this view, _we are mindful of the editors’ caution_ (at para 2-97) that the courts should not be eager to find that a claimant had acted so unreasonably as to break the chain of causation, and _that only “reckless” or “deliberate” conduct would warrant a positive finding in this respect. In our considered view, the respondent’s conduct, while negligent, did not amount to such a high degree of culpability so as to warrant a finding that it had acted recklessly or deliberately and thereby broken the chain of causation. We also take into consideration the context in which the editors’ comments were made and the fact that such comments resonate more readily with_ _personal injury and physical damage claims_, rather than the present claim which relates to economic loss”.

> _\[Emphasis added\]_

### Conclusion on novus actus interveniens

26     Applying these principles to the facts of our case, I found that the Plaintiff’s act did not amount to a _novus actus interveniens_ so as to break the chain of causation.

27     Here, it was clearly _foreseeable_ that the Defendant’s negligence in causing his vehicle to overturn in the middle of an expressway where vehicles were expected to travel at comparably faster speeds, would pose a real danger to vehicles travelling along the expressway. Applying the _PlanAssure_ tests, it could also not be contended that the Plaintiff _deliberately_ collided into the Defendant’s overturned car. The Plaintiff’s act in, among other things, speeding and failing to keep a proper look out was negligent (this will go towards contributory negligence, which will be discussed below), but it could not be said that the Plaintiff’s conduct had been proven to be so _reckless_ or _unreasonable_ so as to break the chain of causation. Travelling at a fast speed is not an uncommon occurrence on an expressway, especially in the right most lanes. There was further no definitive evidence what the Plaintiff’s speed was (see \[35\] below). Public policy and our intuitive sense of justice dictate that in a situation such as this, where it was clearly the Defendant’s admitted negligence that created a dangerous obstruction on an expressway, the Defendant ought not escape liability by asserting that it was the negligence of the Plaintiff, who was travelling normally along the expressway, that had broken the chain of causation.

28     This conclusion is supported by the cases of _Koh Swee Hoon Joanna Ophelia v Yeo Hee Chong_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGHC 190</span> (“_Joanna Ophelia Koh_”) (discussed at \[51\] below) see and _Yang Xi Na v Lim Chong Hong and another (Ong Ah Seng, third party)_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 3 SLR(R) 459</span> (“_Yang Xi Na_”) (discussed at \[57\] below), where the plaintiffs’ vehicles similarly collided into illegally parked and/or stationary vehicles. Yet, it was never contended that the plaintiffs should be denied relief completely on the grounds of _novus actus interveniens_. The issue in both cases was the apportionment of liability, to which I now turn.

### Factual findings

29     It was not disputed that: (i) Plaintiff could not recall the moments leading up to the accident; and (ii) the road condition was wet as it was drizzling, or had just rained.

30     Defence Counsel submitted in her Reply Closing Submissions that I must therefore accept Defendant’s account of how the accident happened wholly, as it was not contradicted by the Plaintiff. I disagree. Even though the Plaintiff could not recall the moments leading up to the accident, the factual findings must still be assessed against the entire evidential package before this court. This would include the contemporaneous statements made by the various witnesses, (crucially) the evidence of DW1, an independent witness; as well as the internal and external inconsistencies of the evidence given by the witnesses in their affidavits and at trial.

31     As Gary Chan noted at \[08.101\] in relation to the apportionment of liability, the court will “take into consideration the \`causative potency\` and the \`blameworthiness\` of the parties involved. _The degree of fault or blameworthiness must depend on the particular facts and circumstances_” _(emphasis added)_. I turn now to the specific circumstances surrounding the accident.

#### Position of the Defendant’s Vehicle

32     DW1’s testimony was that the Defendant’s Vehicle had overturned and came to rest predominantly in lane one, at a 45-degree angle, with the front one-quarter of the Defendant’s Vehicle protruding into lane two of the expressway. DW1 sketched out the resting position of the Defendant’s Vehicle which was admitted as Exhibit D1. Admittedly, DW1’s testimony on this issue was inconsistent with his IDAC sketch[^10], which showed the Defendant’s Vehicle in lane two and protruding into lane three. However, DW1 proffered a reasonable explanation for this apparent discrepancy – he testified in court that he had indicated that the sketch was inaccurate to the IDAC officer who drew it, but the latter assured him it was not necessary to change the sketch[^11]. Significantly, the position of the Defendant’s Vehicle as shown in Exhibit D1 is consistent with DW1’s contemporaneous Police Report where he stated that the overturned vehicle was “covering the first two lanes from the right”[^12].

33     The Defendant, on the other hand, had stated in his trial affidavit that his vehicle had come to a rest in lane two of the BKE[^13].

34     I noted that DW1 was not a voluntary witness. He was subpoenaed by the Defendant as his witness in this trial. DW1 struck me as an independent and candid witness who was unwavering and consistent in his testimony. Indeed, DW1 had no reason to give any evidence that supported the Defendant’s case, as he had a pending claim against the Defendant for the damage caused by the Defendant to his vehicle. I accepted DW1’s depiction of the position of Defendant’s overturned vehicle as shown in Exhibit D1.

#### Plaintiff’s speed

35     Both Defendant and DW1’s testimonies were that Plaintiff was travelling at a very fast speed before colliding into Defendant’s overturned vehicle. DW1 estimated that the Plaintiff was travelling at more than 110km/h, in excess of the expressway speed limit[^14]. This was however an estimated guess only, based on his experience. When probed by Plaintiff’s Counsel on how he could be so sure Plaintiff’s speed was 110 km/h some four years after the accident when this fact was not mentioned in his police statement, DW1 then said the speed was “_roughly_” 110 km/h.[^15] Further, no skid marks analysis or accident reconstruction reports were tendered in support of the probable speed of the Plaintiff moments before the collision. There was, accordingly, no objective evidence as to the _exact_ speed of the Plaintiff’s Motorcycle, in particular whether it exceeded the speed limit, and if so by how much.

36     That said, the Plaintiff could not recall details of the accident. He was therefore in no position to refute the testimonies of DW1 and Defendant, which were consistent in this regard, namely that the Plaintiff was travelling at a _very fast speed in the circumstances_, given the road conditions.

#### Whether hazard lights were on

37     Defendant conceded that no warning signs/barriers were set up by him or any other person next to the overturned vehicle to warn oncoming vehicles[^16]. He, however, mentioned that all four rear hazard lights were on and blinking[^17]. He claimed he did not switch them on; he presumed that they were activated when the airbags were deployed[^18].

38     I found that the Defendant has not adequately proven that his rear hazard lights were on. He who asserts must prove: see s 105 of the Evidence Act. The Defendant did not mention the fact that the brake lights were on in his contemporaneous police statement. He mentioned it for the first time in his trial affidavit given after a 3.5 years gap. DW1 made no reference to Defendant’s hazard lights being on in court. There was further no expert evidence that just because the airbags were deployed, the hazard lights, must therefore come on automatically. How the hazard lights came on despite the Defendant’s admission that he did not switch it on himself was not properly explained. In any event, based on the position of the overturned car as shown in Exhibit D1, which I accepted as accurate, given the 45-degree tilt of the vehicle, I did not think that the rear hazard lights, even if they were on, would have provided significant advance notice to oncoming traffic.

#### Passers-by

39     Again, I am inclined to accept DW1’s testimony which was firm and unwavering on this point. DW1 testified that there was initially only one passerby (a Chinese man) who helped direct the traffic from behind the overturned car, as DW1 and another male Chinese helped Defendant to the road shoulder[^19]. This was right after the Defendant’s Vehicle had overturned, as DW1 was helping Defendant out of the car. As to where the passers-by were at the point Plaintiff collided into the Defendant’s Vehicle minutes later, DW1 marked the location of the two Chinese passers-by by way of two red dots in Exhibit 1, which placed them squarely within the left road shoulder[^20].

40     Thus, even if one or two Chinese men were directing traffic from behind the overturned vehicle right after the vehicle overturned, it was not DW1’s evidence that they continued to do so for the full 10 minutes up to the point the Plaintiff collided into Defendant’s car. Indeed, it would have been improbable and illogical for the two Chinese men to have endangered their lives during the full 10 minutes by standing at the right most lanes of the expressway to control the traffic behind an overturned car in the manner described by the Defendant. Indeed, by the Defendant’s own testimony, he was advised by one of the passers-by not to return to his car to retrieve his handphone as it was dangerous to do so[^21]. It was also difficult to comprehend why the two Chinese men would continue to direct traffic from behind the overturned car for the full ten minutes, when it would have been more logical and safer for the two Chinese men to have set up safety barriers or warnings next to the overturned vehicle, using such equipment from their cars if necessary, to warn oncoming traffic of the imminent danger. From Exhibit D1, there were at least three cars at the scene (excluding the Defendant’s car), and it was likely that one would have a safety or warning plate that could be deployed.

41     I should also note that I also found the Defendant’s testimony on where the passers-by were just before the impact very unsatisfactory. He vacillated repeatedly when testifying as to where the passers-by were. He first said two passers-by directed traffic from behind his overturned car. They were standing at the dotted lines between lanes 1 and 3 (_i.e._ the left edge of the first and second lanes)[^22].

42     He then said there were two groups of passers-by that helped him. The first pair helped him to the road shoulder[^23], and then went back to control the traffic[^24]. He vacillated immediately to say that it was another group of passers-by that helped him to the road shoulder, while the two Chinese passers-by _continued_ with traffic control behind his car throughout the ten minutes until moments before the Plaintiff’s Motorcycle collided into the vehicle[^25]. He vacillated yet again when Plaintiff’s Counsel confronted him with the manner in which paragraphs 5 and 6 of his affidavit were phrased, and agreed that the passers-by that helped him to road shoulder were the _same_ passers-by that helped control traffic[^26].

43     When confronted with paragraph 7 of his affidavit which suggested that he was at the road shoulder with the passers-by that were assisting him, he then said there were a lot of passers-by that came to assist him. This was inconsistent with DW1’s testimony, which only made reference to two Chinese men (from the same car) and one other identified car[^27].

44     During cross-examination, he then stated he could not remember where the passers-by were controlling the traffic, _i.e._ whether it was at lane one, lane two, lane three, lane four, or the left road shoulder[^28]. However, during re-examination, he then asserted that the two Chinese men were controlling the traffic right behind the overturned vehicle up to moments before the impact, before they walked away.

45     Overall, I did not find the Defendant a candid witness. His repeated vacillations as to where the passers-by were appeared to be motivated by his intention to situate the passers-by, who according to him were controlling traffic, at a spot to bolster his argument that the Plaintiff had adequate warning of the overturned vehicle in the moments leading up to the impact.

46     The further fact was that the Defendant sat through DW1’s testimony on the first day of trial. The irresistible impression in my mind was that he was often attempting to tailor his evidence to match DW1’s testimony where it assisted his case, _e.g._ when he tried to align his story about the passers-by directing traffic to match DW1’s account. Another instance where the Defendant changed his evidence to match DW1’s testimony was when he testified at trial that his vehicle had come to a rest three-quarters in lane two and one-quarter in lane one[^29]. This contradicted the Defendant’s version in his affidavit where he deposed that his vehicle came to rest in lane two. There was again a distinct possibility that the Defendant was trying to align his account with DW1’s, who testified that the stationary vehicle straddled lanes 1 and 2.

47     On balance, I preferred DW1’s testimony over Defendant’s. I accepted DW1’s sketch (Exhibit D1) which clearly showed that the assisting passers-by were at the road shoulder with Defendant and DW1 at the point of impact between Plaintiff and the Defendant’s Vehicle.

48     The net sum of my findings is that the Defendant’s overturned vehicle had come to rest predominantly in lane one of the BKE and was protruding slightly into lane two. Defendant’s Vehicle had overturned due to his negligence in failing to maintain a safe distance with an unknown vehicle, and in failing to effectively control his vehicle when he swerved to avoid a collision. No warning signs or barriers were placed in the vicinity of the Defendant’s Vehicle to warn ongoing vehicles of the obstruction. It was also not proven on a balance of probabilities that the braking lights were on and flashing, or that there were passerby directing traffic using flashes and torchlights behind the Defendant’s Vehicle _in the immediate moments_ just before the Plaintiff collided into the Defendant’s Vehicle. Under these circumstances, the Defendant is the author and cause of the dangerous obstruction on the expressway and must bear the bulk of the liability.

### Plaintiff’s contributory negligence

49     DW1’s testimony was that Plaintiff was travelling at more than 110 km/h, in excess of the speed limit of the expressway. As mentioned, this was, however, just DW1’s estimate, based on his experience. I have nevertheless made the finding that, regardless of what the Plaintiff’s precise speed was, it was very fast given the wet road conditions. The fact that the overturned Vehicle was stationary for about 10 minutes without incident, suggested that a reasonably prudent driver in lanes 1 and 2 would have notice the overturned vehicle in good time so as to take precautionary actions. There were also, based on SW1’s testimony (see Exhibit D1) three cars parked at the road shoulder with brake lights on, which would again have suggested to approaching vehicles that there might have been an incident in the location. The fact that Plaintiff did not see the overturned vehicle, or saw it too late, showed a lack of care on his part.

#### The Motor Accident Guide

50     Given the above, I found that the Plaintiff had contributed to the accident by failing to take reasonable care for his own safety. The Motor Accident Guide states at page 91 that where “\[the stationary car\] stops for reasons other than in response to exigencies or traffic or in compliance with road signs or traffic lights or to give way to pedestrians at pedestrian crossing” (_i.e._ where there is unjustified stoppage of a car on the roadway), the stationary’s car liability should be increased by between 50-80%.

#### The Cases

51     In _Joanna Ophelia Koh’s_ case, Belinda Ang J ascribed 40% contributory negligence to the plaintiff motorcyclist who had collided into a stationary lorry parked in the middle of an expressway (TPE). The facts in that case were however different – there, the road was similarly wet, but general visibility was good (at \[23\]). Crucially, the plaintiff there was approaching the merging point between Loyang Avenue and the TPE, intending to go onto the TPE. There was accordingly a heightened duty on the plaintiff’s part to check for traffic along the TPE and Loyang Avenue as she was merging into TPE, especially as traffic was moderate at the relevant time. The judge found that she should have slowed down instead of maintaining her speed (at \[23\]), but did not do so. The judge also found that she was too close to the vehicle in front of her, bearing in mind her speed and the wet surface, leaving herself with insufficient breaking distance with the stationary lorry \[at \[23\]).

52     The findings in _Joanna Ophelia Koh’s_ case also suggested that the defendant there was of comparatively lower culpability. The court found that the defendant stopped where he did because his lorry had a punctured tyre. The Defendant had difficulty cutting across to the chevron, which would have been a safer place to stop, because of his punctured tyre and vehicles coming from Loyang Avenue. In fact Defendant had to slow down, losing momentum as a result, because of the oncoming traffic, while dealing with a flat tyre which made the control of the lorry difficult. He had further also set up a triangular breakdown sign to warn oncoming traffic. 60% liability was entered against the defendant (the stationary vehicle) in light of all these factors.

53     Here, the road conditions were wet too. However, unlike in _Joanna Ophelia Koh’s_ case, DW1’s testimony was that the stretch where the overturned vehicle rested was “slightly dark” as the stretch of road was covered by trees. This is mitigating in Plaintiff’s favour[^30].

54     Plaintiff was further riding straight normally along the right lanes of the expressway, which are used by faster moving vehicles. While he certainly still needed to keep a look out, he was travelling straight along the expressway – his path of travel was not such that he was under a heightened sense of alert, unlike in _Joanna Ophelia Koh’s_ case.

55     Unlike _Joanna Ophelia Koh’s_ case where the defendant suffered a punctured tyre due to no fault of his, here, the Defendant’s car overturned due to his own admitted negligence (see \[10\] above). In my view, the degree of fault to be borne by Defendant in the present case should be higher than that in _Joanna Ophelia Koh’s_ case.

56     In _Tong Khing Kia and anor v Yeo Kong Boon_ <span class="citation">\[1990\] 2 SLR(R) 792</span> (“_Tong Khing Kia_”), the third party vehicle was travelling along Dunearn Road when it suddenly stopped without giving any signals to pick up a passenger. The defendant’s car was 3-4 cars length behind the third party’s vehicle and could not stop in time, colliding into the stationary vehicle. Chao Hick Tin J found the third party 100% liable for stopping abruptly in the middle of the road when oncoming vehicle would not expect it to do so. No contributory negligence was ascribed to the defendant who was travelling behind the third party. The court found that there was no evidence that the defendant was speeding or following too closely behind the third party’s car (at \[10\], \[15\]). The third party’s car had stopped abruptly and the defendant took the only evasive step possible (_i.e._ by breaking), but the accident still could not be avoided. There was nothing the defendant could have done.

57     On the other hand in _Yang Xi Na’s_ case, Kan Ting Chiu J only ascribed 20% liability to the stationary vehicle. The Plaintiff’s bus had collided into the stationary vehicle, which was a tipper that had parked along the left side of the road along Woodlands Industrial Park D, Street 1, just outside a factory. The road structure and location in _Yang Xi Na’s_ case was very different. The tipper was _parked by the side of the road_, and not in the middle of an expressway or roadway. The accident further happened in an industrial park, where it was reasonable to foresee that vehicles may park by the road side, albeit in breach of traffic rules, for the night.

58     Similarly in _Kang Hock Seng Paul v Lee Teck Nam_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] SGHC 308</span>, it was raining heavily at that time, and the defendant’s vehicle had skidded after a right bend in the road, ascended up the kerb at the center of the road divider and came to a rest with the front wheel in the central drain area, and with the front of the car protruding angularly into the outermost lane of the 3-lane double carriageway. The High Court held that the stationary vehicle, which had become stuck in the central drain area of a road divider, was not liable at all. However, this was on the basis that the judge found that the stationary vehicle _“_came to be on the road through a mishap _not arising from any negligent conduct on the part of the \[defendant\]”_\[at 17\]. The defendant there testified that he lost control as he had swerved to avoid a pedestrian who had dashed across the road (at \[1\]). In contrast, in the present case, it was conceded that the Defendant’s car had overturned due to his negligence (see \[10\] above).

### Conclusion on Contributory Negligence

59     The present case is more similar to _Tong Khing Kia’s_ case - both plaintiffs’ vehicles were travelling normally along the road and had no reasons to expect obstructions ahead. As the Court of Appeal noted in _Hum Weng Fong v Koh Siang Hong_ \[2008\] 3 SLR (R) 1137 at \[26\]:

> “_Apportionment of liability is an exercise involving the comparison of culpability, and of the relative importance, of the acts of the parties in causing the damage or injuries_. For this purpose it will be necessary to look at the entire conduct of each of the parties. _It is very much a balancing act_, a matter of judgment on which opinions among judges might well differ. _It is not a science_.” _(emphasis added)_

60     Taking into account the blameworthiness of the parties involve (see Gary Chan at \[08.101\]), it was clearly the Defendant’s act of negligence, which Defendant readily conceded, which had given rise to the chain of events that ended up in the Defendant’s vehicle overturning and coming to a stop in the right most lane of the BKE. As noted in paragraph \[48\] above, Defendant’s Vehicle had overturned due to his negligence in failing to maintain a safe distance with an unknown vehicle, and in failing to effectively control his vehicle when he swerved to avoid a collision. No warning signs or barriers were placed in the vicinity of the Defendant’s Vehicle to warn oncoming vehicles of the obstruction. It was also not proven on a balance of probabilities that the Defendant’s rear braking lights were on, and even if they were, that they were effective in warning to approaching traffic in light of the 45-degree tilt of the overturned vehicle. The area where the Defendant’s Vehicle had stopped was also slightly dark due to the trees along that stretch. It was also not proven that there were passers-by directing traffic using flashes and torchlights behind the Defendant’s Vehicle in the immediate moments just before the Plaintiff collided into the Defendant’s Vehicle. There was, in the final analysis, very little measures in place to warn the Plaintiff of the overturned vehicle, which had further overturned on the first lane of the BKE, which was used by fast travelling vehicles. The Defendant should therefore be held liable to a large degree for the ensuing collision between the Plaintiff’s Motorcycle and his overturned vehicle.

61     However, in the present case, I am of the view that the Plaintiff was contributorily negligent to some degree. He was travelling at a fast speed in light of the wet road conditions, though there was no conclusive evidence as to the exact speed he was travelling at. He failed to keep a proper look out for his own safety, when similarly situated vehicles during the intervening 10 minutes appeared to have had no difficulties seeing and avoiding the overturned vehicle.

62     Defence Counsel did not submit on any apportionment of liability as she was adamant the Defendant should not be held liable on the grounds of _novus actus interveniens_. Having considered the relative culpabilities of the parties, and considering the apportionment of liability in _Joanna Ophelia Koh’s_ case _and Tong Khing Kia’s_ case, I agree with Plaintiff Counsel’s initial submission that 20% contributory negligence ought to be ascribed to the Plaintiff, principally in light of the fact that he was travelling at a very fast speed at the material time (albeit he was on the right lanes of the expressway meant for faster travelling vehicles), and road conditions were wet. In coming to this conclusion, I found _Joanna Ophelia Koh’s_ case, where the plaintiff was found to be 40% contributorily negligent, to be particularly instructive. In view of the distinguishing factual matrixes in the present case and _Joanna Ophelia Koh’s_ case as noted in \[51\] to \[55\] above, I was of the view that the Plaintiff’s share of the blame should be lower than the plaintiff in _Joanna Ophelia Koh’s_ c_ase._ I accordingly ascribed 20% contributory negligence to the Plaintiff.

## Judgment

63     For these reasons, there will be Interlocutory Judgement in Plaintiff’s favour to the extent of 80% of damages to be assessed. Costs and interest will be reserved to the assessing Registrar.
