Criminal Law – Companies Act – Carrying on business for fraudulent purpose

1 September 2022

### District Judge Ng Peng Hong:

## Introduction

1       The joint trial before me concerns two accused persons (collectively “**the Accused Persons**”), Iseli Rudolf James Maitland (“**James**”) and How Soo Feng (“**Sue**”), who were directors of TGL Pte Ltd (“**TGL**”). They each face a single charge under s 340(5) read with s 340(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed).

> Iseli Rudolf James Maitland

> “You…Iseli Rudolf James Maitland…are charged that you, between 16 December 2009 and 7 October 2010, in Singapore, being a director of The Gold Label Pte Ltd (the “Company”), were knowingly a party to the carrying on of the business of the Company for the fraudulent purpose of selling gold bars under a buyback scheme promising returns when in fact the Company did not operate any substantive profit generating business and had no sustainable means to honour its payment and buyback obligations, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 340(5) read with Section 340(1) of the Companies Act, Chapter 50 (Revised Edition 2006).”

> How Soo Feng

> “You…How Soo Feng…are charged that you, between 16 December 2009 and 7 October 2010, in Singapore, being a director of The Gold Label Pte Ltd (the “Company”), were knowingly a party to the carrying on of the business of the Company for the fraudulent purpose of selling gold bars under a buyback scheme promising returns when in fact the Company did not operate any substantive profit generating business and had no sustainable means to honour its payment and buyback obligations, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 340(5) read with Section 340(1) of the Companies Act, Chapter 50 (Revised Edition 2006).

2       In order for the charges to be established, the following two elements have to be proven against both of the Accused Persons at the material period between 16 December 2009 and 7 October 2010:

> (a)     First, the business of TGL was carried on for the fraudulent purpose of selling gold bars under a buyback scheme promising returns when in fact TGL did not operate any substantive profit generating business and had no sustainable means to honour its payment and buyback obligations (the “**Fraudulent Purpose**”); and

> (b)     Second, the accused person was knowingly a party to the carrying on of the business of TGL for the Fraudulent Purpose.

3       The legal principles in respect of both the _actus reus_ and _mens rea_ elements are well-established. The term “fraudulent purpose” connotes an intention to go beyond the bounds of what ordinary decent people engaged in business would regard as honest, or actions deserving real moral blame according to the current notions of fair trading amongst commercial men: _Phang Wah v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 646</span> at \[24\].

4       With regard to the _mens rea_ element, a finding of dishonesty is required. Knowledge encompasses a situation where a person turns a blind eye to the obvious: _Phang Wah and ors v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 646</span> at \[25\]. In _PP v Phang Wah and ors_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGDC 505</span> at \[254\], “blind-eye knowledge” was described as existing when a party in question shuts his eyes to the obvious because of a conscious fear that to enquire further will confirm suspicion of wrongdoing which already exists.

5       Bearing in mind these applicable legal principles, I now turn to the evidence in relation to the _actus reus_ element.

## The business of TGL was carried on for the Fraudulent Purpose

6       TGL was in the business of selling gold bars under a buyback scheme. The buyback scheme commenced sales on 16 December 2009 and operated in the following manner.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

> (a)     First, TGL would enter into a contract to sell gold bars to its clients (gold bars in denominations of 100 grams, 500 grams and 1 kilogram respectively). TGL would buy these gold bars from retail sources at retail prices. For example, TGL would buy gold bars from institutions such as the United Overseas Bank Ltd and Bank of China that sold gold bars directly to retail customers, and at prices that were published daily.

> (b)     TGL would then sell the same gold bars bought from the above retail sources to clients at a markup above what it cost TGL to purchase the gold bars (the “**TGL Selling Price**”). The TGL Selling Price was decided on a daily basis, with the markup above the gold bars’ cost price ranging from 15% to 37.8%. The average markup was 24%.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2)

> (c)     At the end of the contract term, the clients had two options. They could either require TGL to buy back the gold bars at the TGL Selling Price, or they could opt to keep the gold bars.

7       Using the buyback model, two different plans (i.e. the GD or GSS plan) were offered by TGL to its clients:[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3)

> (a)     Under the GD plan, clients would take physical delivery of the gold bars after they entered into a contract with TGL and paid the TGL Selling Price; and

> (b)     Under the GSS plan, gold bars sold to clients were kept in Certis CISCO’s bonded warehouse in Singapore, instead of being held by clients. Goods and Services Tax (“**GST**”) was not imposed on the gold bars kept in the warehouse and would be imposed only when clients requested to withdraw the gold from the warehouse.

8       Both plans were offered in durations of 3 months and 6 months, the details of which are explained as follows.

> (a)      GD plan (3-month contract): Clients who entered into a 3-month contract under the GD plan would receive an initial discount of 1.5% of the TGL Selling Price, and would receive a pay-out of 2% of the said TGL Selling Price at the expiry of the contract (i.e. after 3 months).

> At the end of the 3-month contract and upon receipt of the 2% pay-out, clients were given two options of: (1) exercising a sellback option to sell the gold bars back to TGL or (2) keeping the gold bars. For clients who elected to exercise the sellback option, TGL would repurchase the gold bars from them at the TGL Selling Price. The 3-month GD contracts did not appear to require payment of GST and clients were not charged for GST.

> (b)      GD plan (6-month contract): Clients who entered into a 6-month contract under the GD plan would receive an initial discount of 3% of the TGL Selling Price. TGL would then charge the client GST of 7% of the discounted TGL Selling Price. Clients would receive a pay-out of 3% of the said TGL Selling Price at the midpoint of the contract (i.e. after 3 months) and a further pay-out of 3% at the end of the contract (i.e. after 6 months).

> At the end of the 6-month contract and after receiving the pay-outs, clients were given two options of: (1) exercising a sellback option to sell the gold bars back to TGL or (2) keeping the gold bars. For clients who elected to exercise the sellback option, TGL would repurchase the gold bars from them at the TGL Selling Price plus the GST paid by the client.

> (c)      GSS plan (3-month contract): Clients who entered into a 3-month contract under the GSS plan would receive an initial discount of 2.5% of the TGL Selling Price. TGL would then charge clients a Storage Service Fee (“**SSF**”) and GST on this SSF, totalling 7% of the discounted TGL Selling Price paid by clients. At the end of the contract (i.e. after 3 months), clients would receive a pay-out of 3% of the TGL Selling Price.

> At the end of the 3-month contract and upon receipt of the 3% pay-out, clients were given two options of: (1) exercising a sellback option to sell the gold bars back to TGL or (2) keeping the gold bars. For clients who elected to exercise the sellback option, TGL would repurchase the gold bars from them at the TGL Selling Price plus the SSF and GST paid on the SSF.

> (d)      GSS plan (6-month contract): Clients who entered into a 6-month contract under the GSS plan would receive an initial discount of 3% of the TGL Selling Price. TGL would then charge clients a SSF and GST on this SSF, totalling 7% of the discounted TGL Selling Price paid by clients. Clients would receive a pay-out of 3% of the said TGL Selling Price at the midpoint of the contract (i.e. after 3 months) and a further pay-out of 6% at the end of the contract (i.e. after 6 months).

> At the end of the 6-month contract and upon receipt of the pay-outs, clients were given two options of: (1) exercising a sellback option to sell the gold bars back to TGL or (2) keeping the gold bars. For clients who elected to exercise the sellback option, TGL would repurchase the gold bars from them at the TGL Selling Price plus the SSF and GST paid on the SSF.

9       The upshot of the GD and GSS contracts under the buyback scheme was that TGL’s clients would be contractually guaranteed a return of the full amount they paid for the gold (if they exercised the sellback option) on top of the significant pay-outs.

10     Apart from the promised pay-outs to clients, TGL incurred expenses in running the gold buyback business. These expenses include operational costs, the monthly sales commission paid to SWM, and the monthly directors’ fees paid to James, Sue and FTEG. The latter two heads of expenses are elaborated further below.

11     TGL did not have in-house sales and marketing employees, and instead engaged SWM to market and sell its gold buyback schemes. TGL entered into a service agreement with SWM Investment Pte Ltd ("**SWM**") dated 12 December 2009[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4) for SWM to, among other things, market and promote TGL's gold buyback plans. SWM in turn engaged its own sales agencies to market and sell the said schemes, and SWM's main source of income was the gold trade from TGL. For every GD or GSS contract sold, TGL paid SWM sales commission amounting to 1.5% of the contract value each month over the entire contract duration. SWM would then pay the sales agencies an average of 1.3% of the contract value each month over the entire contract duration. SWM would keep the remaining 0.2% of the contract value.

12     From December 2009 to March 2010, for each GD or GSS contract sold, James and Sue each received 0.5% of the total value of all the gold buyback contracts sold to clients for the first month, and 0.25% of the total contract value for each subsequent month for the remaining contract duration. FTEG received (as directors’ fees) 1% of the total contract value for the first month, and 0.5% of the total contract value for each subsequent month for the remaining contract duration. In April 2010, James and Sue proposed to revise the quantum of the directors’ fees from percentage fees to a fixed monthly payment of $20,000 (to be shared among James, Sue and FTEG). However, there was no eventual resolution as to whether the revision was confirmed, and the payment of directors’ fees from April 2010 onwards appeared to have been held in abeyance.[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5)

### TGL’s gold buyback scheme was inherently unprofitable

13     TGL’s sole business, the sale of gold contracts under the gold buyback scheme, was inherently loss-making and unprofitable. Based on the financial projections done by TGL’s own accounting department at the time when TGL was selling the gold buyback contracts, it was estimated that TGL would suffer a net loss of over $11.7 million for the period of December 2009 to 30 June 2010 if all its clients exercised the buyback option.[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) Even if only 50% of the clients exercised the buyback option, TGL’s loss would be over $5.8 million.[^7] TGL’s income statement from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010 shows a net loss of about $6.16 million.[^8]

14     Pertinently, the Prosecution's expert witness, Ms Ng Chun Chun (PW6), prepared an expert report (the “**Expert Report**”) which sets out in detail how none of the contracts offered under the gold buyback scheme could have been profitable.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9) I agree with and accept the Expert Report's finding that the GD and GSS contracts sold by TGL were not profitable.

15     Given that the gold buyback scheme was inherently unprofitable, TGL could viably sustain its business to meet its pay-out and buyback obligations only if it had separate substantive profit-generating businesses or investments activities. However, TGL had none of these.

### TGL had no profit-generating business or investments

16     Outside the purchase and sale of gold bars, there were no investing activities conducted by TGL save for a time deposit of $1.9 million placed with Standard Chartered Bank on 29 June 2010. However, this time deposit was fully withdrawn on 13 August 2010 before the maturity date of 29 September 2010. Thus, no interest was earned on the $1.9 million.[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10)

17     During the period from 16 December 2009 to 7 October 2010, 92% of TGL’s total fund inflow came from the sale of gold bars to its clients under the GD and GSS contracts.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11) The other 8% of fund inflow came from (i) liquidating its gold inventory to the market, (ii) Storage Service Fee collections, (iii) bank interest income, and (iv) administrative fees collected from the client to view the GSS gold bars residing in the warehouse.[^12] Other than these and TGL’s own share capital, TGL did not have any other sources of cash inflows. Based on a review of TGL’s fund flow, there is no evidence to show that TGL had any form of investing activities.[^13] There was no reason for me to doubt the Expert Report. I fully agree with its analysis and find that TGL had no substantive profit-generating business or investment activities.

18     For completeness, I did not find Joanne’s (PW5) testimony that TGL did investment through the purchase of excess gold bars to be credible. Apart from the documentary evidence which clearly shows that there were insignificant amounts of excess gold bars in stock, Joanne admitted in her own CAD statement that there were no instructions for additional gold bars to be purchased and kept as stock to be sold back to suppliers when gold prices increase.[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14) The emails which she sent out to Gary (PW8) (with James and Sue in copy) also show that there was hardly any gold stock on hand, and the amount of gold purchased were merely sufficient to cover the demand from clients.[^15] In any event, the excess gold bars purchased were for the 100g gold bars as there was usually a shortage for it due to the high demand from clients. Moreover, these additional 100g gold bars would be sold to clients in one or two days’ time.[^16] These gold bars were not bought for investment to generate returns.[^17]

### TGL did not run any profit-generating “formula”

19     A crucial aspect of TGL’s business model was a mysterious and elusive “formula” which was said to be able to generate the requisite returns needed to pay clients their pay-outs and pay sales agents their monthly commissions. TGL conducted training session for its sales agents, so that the sales agents were able to explain the “formula” to potential clients. Sales agents were provided with training slides which asserted that TGL was not running a Ponzi scheme and was able to make money through the “formula”.

20     While TGL was in operations, there were many, including the TGL’s own employees, who were under the illusion that the TGL was running a “formula”. However, no one was able to show or explain how this “formula” actually worked to generate profits. In truth, I find that there was no “formula” that was being applied by FTEG or anyone else to generate profits or investment returns for TGL. Let me elaborate.

> (a)     Janet (PW4) understood the “formula” to involve merely the transfer of monies between TGL’s six bank accounts as instructed by Norman.[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18) These internal transfers did not generate any profits for TGL.[^19]

> (b)     Norman (PW7) testified that there was never a “formula”,[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20) and he has never come across or operated any “formula” within TGL.[^21] His IT job in TGL was merely to do the allocation of fund so that Gary can view it from his phone.[^22] The IT system provided by FTEG does not make any profits for TGL or assists TGL in making any investments.[^23]

> (c)     Joanne acknowledged that there was no “formula” which existed to invest the monies to generate returns that could be used to pay clients’ rebates.[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24) In her own words, when she was confronted with Norman’s affidavit stating that there was no “formula”, Joanne replied that she felt “_like a fool_” because she “_never once \[she\] thought there were no formulas_”.[^25]

> (d)     Gordon’s (PW1) evidence was that he had tried to find out from Janet and Joanne what FTEG does. After further questioning on how the financial model could work, he came to the conclusion that there was “_really, really nothing_” apart from monies being transferred between TGL’s bank accounts.[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26)

21     The Defence pointed to a document[\[note: 27\]](#Ftn_27) which is said to have outlined the “formula” used at Genneva Sdn Bhd to generate returns from the sale and purchase of gold (“**the Sheng & Co Document**”).[^28] The Sheng & Co Document sets out a series of steps which purportedly show how it is possible to “earn more than 16% from the selling and buying gold bar or gold coins”. Crucially, no evidence was led by the Defence to satisfactorily prove how these obfuscatory steps would lead to the promised returns being earned. Neither has the Defence shown how these steps were applied in TGL to generate profits.

22     The Defence also argued that the Prosecution’s expert witness was assessing the viability of TGL on hindsight without the benefit of Gary’s “formula”.[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29) However, no financial documents or reports were produced by the Defence to show how the application of Gary’s “formula” would have generated any profits or returns for TGL. Neither did the Defence call any expert witness of their own to rebut or challenge the Expert Report’s conclusion that the business operations of TGL were fundamentally unprofitable. The Expert Report was essentially prepared based on TGL’s own financial documents, none of which shows that a “formula” was being applied to generate profits or returns for TGL.[^30]

23     Considering all the evidence, I am of the view that the overwhelming evidence demonstrates that TGL’s gold buyback scheme was inherently unsustainable with no substantive profit-generating business or investment activities. The Expert Report concluded that TGL was essentially running a Ponzi scheme as TGL used sales generated from new contracts to fulfil its payment obligations under existing contracts.[\[note: 31\]](#Ftn_31) I agree.

24     Overall, I find that between 16 December 2009 and 7 October 2010, the business of TGL was carried on for the Fraudulent Purpose. The _actus reus_ element for both Accused Persons is also established beyond a reasonable doubt which will be elaborated below when assessing James’ and Sue’s involvement in TGL.

## James and Sue were parties to the carrying on of the business of TGL for the Fraudulent Purpose

25     I find that between 16 December 2009 and 7 October 2010, James and Sue were parties to the carrying on of TGL’s business. It was without a doubt that TGL was not running a legitimate business but a Ponzi scheme. The Defence’s main contention lies in whether James and Sue knew that TGL was carrying on business with the Fraudulent Purpose.[\[note: 32\]](#Ftn_32)

26     Before moving on to analyse the _mens rea_ in detail, it will be apposite at this juncture to lay out the background of James’ and Sue’s involvement in TGL. I first look at the means by which James and Sue were financially rewarded through TGL (directly and indirectly through SWM), before addressing the nature and extent of their involvement as directors and majority shareholders of TGL.

### Financial rewards from TGL and SWM

27     James and Sue were the directors and shareholders of TGL from 7 July 2009 to 15 November 2010. TGL’s paid up capital was made up of 1,227,000 ordinary shares. Together, James and Sue were the majority shareholders, collectively owning 627,000 TGL shares. From 24 February 2010 to 3 September 2010, FTEG owned the remaining 600,000 TGL shares. A total of $1,196,447.30 was paid in directors’ fees between July 2009 and March 2010.[\[note: 33\]](#Ftn_33)

28     James and Sue were also the shareholders of SWM, with James being the Managing Director of SWM. As highlighted above at \[11\], SWM had a service agreement with TGL to market and promote TGL's gold buyback plans. SWM earned a net profit of $337,551.05 and $110,664.80 for the period spanning 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010 and the period spanning 1 July 2010 to 31 December 2010 respectively.[\[note: 34\]](#Ftn_34) Sue’ agency also earned sales commission from selling the gold buyback contracts. Based on TGL’s sales summary of commission paid to agents, TGL paid to Sue’s agency almost $200,000 as sales commission between March 2010 and October 2010.[^35]

29     In summary, by virtue of their positions held in TGL and SWM, James and Sue stood to benefit handsomely from TGL’s sales. Even without the directors’ fees, James and Sue were well placed to reap financial gains through SWM for as long as TGL’s gold buyback scheme kept running. The more GD and GSS contracts sold by TGL through SWM, the greater the monetary rewards earned by James and Sue.

### Involvement in the management and control of TGL

30     The Defence argued that the sole mastermind of TGL’s gold buyback business was Gary. He was said to be the directing mind and will of the company, having been the only one in charge of the day-to-day operations of TGL. According to James and Sue, there was a clear separation of roles and responsibilities, and they were merely in charge of the sales and marketing aspect of the company. The operations and the running of the “formula” were left entirely to Gary and FTEG.

31     On a general level, I accept there was a distinction in the roles played by James and Sue on the one hand, and Gary on the other. However, the evidence did not show that James and Sue were completely uninvolved in terms of the management and control of TGL. I am of the view that as directors of the company, James and Sue retained oversight of the business and remained apprised of the affairs in TGL through updates and reports from Janet and Joanne, even if they were not in Singapore much and did not visit TGL’s office often.

32     On paper, James and Sue were the majority shareholders of TGL (more than 50%) with overriding control in the company. For instance, at a board of directors meeting dated 21 April 2010, James and Sue proposed to reduce the percentage fees payable to directors per month to a fixed fee of $20,000 per month. There was no approval from Gary who had suggested for FTEG’s directors’ fees to be paid as IT service fees instead. Nevertheless, the outcome of the meeting was that the fees paid to all directors will be held back from April 2010.[\[note: 36\]](#Ftn_36) James and Sue were able to effectively override Gary’s objection, and withhold payment of directors’ fees to FTEG.[^37]

33     Related to the above incident was also an issue regarding payment of commissions fees to SWM. Gary threatened that if James and Sue were not agreeable for directors’ fees to be paid as IT service fees, he would stop paying commission to the agents in SWM. In Sue’s statement to CAD, she acknowledged that they nevertheless managed to pay the commissions. This was because the commissions could be paid with the signatures of either James, Sue or Gary, and either Joanne or Janet.[\[note: 38\]](#Ftn_38) In other words, sales commission could be paid based simply on the approval of James or Sue, without Gary’s approval.[^39] Both of them were signatories to TGL’s cheques. James and Sue were also able to make decisions on pricing of gold bars, at least after FTEG’s representatives no longer came to office.[^40]

34     Hence, it was not the case that James and Sue had no say or control over how TGL was ran. In fact, they had the power to and were capable of making key business and financial decisions on behalf of the company. Inasmuch as James and Sue are now trying to pin the blame solely on Gary or FTEG by emphasising on the strict compartmentalisation of roles, I find these endeavours to be convenient attempts to distance themselves from the fraudulent nature of the business that was being carried on in TGL. The influence and authority wielded by James and Sue while they were majority shareholders of TGL were not so limited to sales and marketing as they claim to be.

35     In my judgment, the Accused Persons were involved in TGL’s business. With this context in mind, I now turn to the _mens rea_ element of both Accused Persons.

## James and Sue were knowingly parties to the carrying on of the business of TGL for the Fraudulent Purpose

36     To first deal with a preliminary issue raised by the Defence, I find that the Prosecution have not advanced inconsistent cases in terms of when and how the Accused Persons acquired the _mens rea_ knowledge. There is accordingly no prejudice to the manner in which the Accused Persons may conduct their defence.

> (a)     First, from Day 1 of the trial, the Prosecution’s opening statement unequivocally stated that the Prosecution would show that James and Sue would have known “at the outset” that TGL’s gold buyback scheme was loss-making[\[note: 41\]](#Ftn_41) and “from the outset” that no monies went towards investment to make sufficient profit to pay investors.[^42] In this regard, the Prosecution is entitled to cross-examine the Accused Persons by asking questions which will shed light on whether and when the Accused Persons had the requisite _mens rea_ knowledge. The Prosecution could not be said to be running inconsistent cases simply because different questions may have been put to the Accused Persons in order to test their respective positions on the said knowledge, i.e. whether the Accused Persons had the knowledge from the outset or at a later stage. In fact, by doing so, the Prosecution was being fair to the Accused Persons by giving them the opportunity to account for and explain their evidence.

> (b)     Second, looking at the Joint Summary of Facts (“**JSOF**”), the Prosecution’s case has always been that James and Sue knew that TGL’s business was unsustainable.[\[note: 43\]](#Ftn_43) It is also clear from the JSOF that the Prosecution intends to support its case through evidence such as daily reports submitted to James, Sue and Gary, and how they were unable to credibly explain how TGL generated enough funds to meet its payment and buyback obligations.[^44] These are merely _examples_ of the evidence to be used in establishing the Prosecution’s case. The Prosecution is not bound by the JSOF such that the Prosecution can only put forward evidence to prove facts which are mentioned in the JSOF. Here, I see no material departure from the JSOF, given that the case advanced by the Prosecution at the trial was consistent with its position in the JSOF (i.e. that James and Sue knew that TGL’s business was unsustainable from 16 December 2009 to 7 October 2010).

37     Next I turn to issues of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded to the evidence of certain witnesses. It is not a rule of law that the evidence of a witness must be believed in its entirety, or not at all.[\[note: 45\]](#Ftn_45) I will now make some observations regarding the evidence of Joanne and Gary adduced at trial.

> (a)     Joanne was treated by the Prosecution as a hostile witness after the cross-examination by both Defence Counsel. She was cross-examined by the Prosecution pursuant to s 156 of the Evidence Act against her statement to CAD.[\[note: 46\]](#Ftn_46) Overall, I accept that there are certain portions of her oral evidence which are materially inconsistent with the objective documentary evidence. These largely relate to the extent of James’ and Sue’s knowledge and involvement in the affairs of TGL, and tended to exculpate the Accused Persons. In so far as these contradictory aspects of Joanne’s oral evidence are concerned, I exercised greater scrutiny and caution, and was prepared to place little to no weight especially where they are uncorroborated by contemporaneous records or the evidence of other independent witnesses.

> (b)     Gary was an uncooperative witness almost from the beginning of his examination-in-chief. Most of his answers were either “_I do not know_” or “_I don’t remember_”. The Prosecution applied to treat Gary as a hostile witness and cross-examine him under s 156 of the Evidence Act. After cross-examination, the Prosecution applied under s 147(3) of the Evidence Act to admit his CAD statements into evidence in substitution of his oral evidence, and under s 157(c) of the Evidence Act to impeach the credit of Gary as a witness. These statements largely inculpated the Accused Persons. In my assessment, even though these statements were eventually admitted, I was ultimately hesitant to place any significant weight on these statements as Gary was wholly unhelpful in assisting the court to understand the contents of those statements. Given his uncooperative nature on the stand, the Defence also did not have the opportunity to meaningfully test or challenge the evidence as set out in those statements. However, I agree that Gary’s statements corroborate the other evidence led by the Prosecution that there was no investment activity in TGL to invest the proceeds of the gold buyback business.

38     Having heard the entirety of the evidence at trial, I did not find James and Sue to be credible witnesses. A substantial portion of their defence consisted of bare and unsupported assertions. Further, there are key portions of their oral evidence which are simply incapable of belief, either because they are internally contradictory to their own contemporaneous conduct, or because they are externally inconsistent with the objective documentary records, or both. Crucially, there are significant portions of their statements to the Commercial Affairs Department (“**CAD**”) which reveal that James and Sue knew of the fraudulent nature of the business that was being carried on by TGL. The relevant portions of their CAD statements will be reproduced below at the respective stages when assessing James’ and Sue’s knowledge.

### Knowledge as at the commencement of TGL’s operations

#### Raiding of Genneva Sdn Bhd by Bank Negara

39     By way of background, James and Sue were involved in the setting up of TGL Sdn Bhd in Malaysia. TGL Sdn Bhd was incorporated on 22 April 2009, with Sue being one of the directors and James being a substantial investor and shareholder. TGL Sdn Bhd operated a gold buyback scheme which was modelled after Genneva Sdn Bhd, a company for which James and Sue had previously helped to market gold under SWM Sdn Bhd.

40     James and Sue hired Gary’s company, FTEG Sdn Bhd, to provide IT services to the gold buyback business of TGL Sdn Bhd. They understood that Gary and Thomson brought the business model and “formula” for generating profits from Genneva Sdn Bhd to TGL Sdn Bhd. Thus, TGL Sdn Bhd operated the same business model and “formula” as Genneva Sdn Bhd to generate the necessary profits.

41     Shortly after TGL Sdn Bhd was set up, James and Sue set up TGL in Singapore. TGL was incorporated on 28 April 2009, and adopted the same business model as Genneva Sdn Bhd and TGL Sdn Bhd. FTEG was later incorporated on 16 July 2009 to run the “formula” for TGL, and Gary would run the “formula” both in Malaysia (through FTEG Sdn Bhd) and in Singapore (through FTEG).

42     On 21 July 2009, Bank Negara announced that it raided and commenced investigations into Genneva Sdn Bhd under suspicion of conducting illegal deposit taking activities and of money laundering activities.[\[note: 47\]](#Ftn_47)

> (a)     According to James’ statement to the CAD, he advised his clients to get out of Genneva Sdn Bhd, because he was concerned that Genneva Sdn Bhd was not going to be able to honour the payment obligations to the client.[\[note: 48\]](#Ftn_48) He also admitted in court that he had concerns about the legitimacy of Genneva Sdn Bhd’s business model after the raid.[^49] I am of the view that James’ concerns did not merely arise out of mismanagement, potential pilferage[^50] or money laundering.[^51] These are mere afterthoughts not mentioned in his CAD statement.[^52]

> (b)     As for Sue, she claimed to be concerned by the news that Genneva Sdn Bhd was under criminal investigations by Bank Negara, and had thought whether the business model may be illegal.[\[note: 53\]](#Ftn_53) She alleged to have received a confirmation from Bank Negara that it was not illegal.[^54] However, no such confirmation was eventually produced and admitted as evidence at the trial. I therefore reject her bare allegation.

43     In sum, James and Sue acknowledged that the raiding by Bank Negara raised sufficient cause for concern with regard to the business model and viability of the “formula”, given that they originated from Genneva Sdn Bhd. Nevertheless, James and Sue went ahead to commence operations and sales of TGL’s gold buyback scheme a few months later in December 2009.

#### Known issues with the business model and the “formula”

44     It was not disputed that FTEG Sdn Bhd was contracted to provide IT services to TGL Sdn Bhd. In return, TGL Sdn Bhd paid FTEG Sdn Bhd a 2% commission on TGL Sdn Bhd’s monthly sales. Sometime in December 2009/January 2010, Gary did not submit the profit and loss report for FTEG Sdn Bhd, and James and Sue held on to the payment to FTEG Sdn Bhd. This is confirmed by the statements to CAD from James[\[note: 55\]](#Ftn_55) and Sue[^56].

45     Also, sometime in December 2009, James asked Joseph Goh (who was then the manager at TGL Sdn Bhd) (“**Joseph**”) and a long-time trusted friend,[\[note: 57\]](#Ftn_57) to show him the financials of TGL Sdn Bhd. Joseph replied (with Sue also in attendance) that in the long run, TGL Sdn Bhd would not be able to pay clients the returns and buy back their gold bars if the operation continued to run “that way”.[^58] I am unable to accept James’ explanation in court that Joseph was referring to “_stealing of gold bars_”[^59] as it contradicts his own statement to CAD. According to James’ statement to the CAD, Joseph was “pushing the blame” to FTEG Sdn Bhd. [^60] James believed Joseph to have meant that the operations of TGL Sdn Bhd was not being run in line with his initial understanding of the business model.[^61] Similar to the Bank Negara raid in July 2009, these events would also have raised doubts in the minds of James and Sue as to the sustainability of TGL’s business model and the profitability of the “formula” to be run by Gary in TGL. Yet, James and Sue took the unusual step of commencing sales in TGL within the same month (i.e in December 2009), using the very same business model and “formula” ran by the very same person (i.e. Gary).

46     The cumulative effect of the above red flags meant that by the time when TGL had just started commencing sales in December 2009 and January 2010, James and Sue must have been aware of the known problems with Gary’s business model and/or “formula”. By deciding nevertheless to proceed with the commencement of TGL’s sales during the same period, the inference is that James and Sue either did not seriously believe in the workability or profitability of the “formula”, or that they already knew there was no real profit-generating “formula” to begin with.

### Knowledge throughout the course of TGL’s operations

#### Perpetuation of a money circulation scheme

47     During the material period while TGL was in business operations, I find that both James and Sue knew that TGL was using monies from new sales of the GD and GSS contracts to repay its obligations under older GD and GSS contracts. Both James and Sue had made admissions in their statements to the CAD to this effect. I agree with the Prosecution that the admissions as well as Sue’s concessions[\[note: 62\]](#Ftn_62) during cross-examination indicated the Accused Persons knew they were running a fraudulent business.[^63]

> (a)     In James’ statement to the CAD, he recognised that the business model will encounter a problem if the number of clients who sell back their gold bars to TGL exceed the number of clients who purchase the gold bars from TGL. He further explained “_if we do not have clients to buy gold bars from TGL, we are not able to roll. This is the only way I think the business can work… the business must keep rolling and this means we had to have a constant flow of clients_”.[\[note: 64\]](#Ftn_64)

> (b)     In Sue’ statement to the CAD, she explained that the margin received from clients would be used to purchase additional gold bars. Therefore, within the contract period, TGL would “_use the margin to roll and accumulate more gold bars and more sales”_. She further elaborated “_The whole business model is essentially like a cycle, while the margin is used to purchase more gold bars. These gold bars would then be used to generate more sales_”.[\[note: 65\]](#Ftn_65)

48     An email from Joanne to James, Sue and Gary dated 3 August 2010 would also corroborate James’ and Sue’s knowledge that the continuation of TGL’s business was dependent on selling more GD and GSS contracts in order to sustain the cash flow. In that email, Joanne highlighted TGL’s dire financial situation and explained that TGL’s low sales “_is unable to support the cashflow requirement_”.[\[note: 66\]](#Ftn_66)

#### No investment or profit-generating business was conducted

49     Further, I find that James and Sue knew there was no substantive profit-generating business or investment activities being carried out in TGL, despite knowing that investments or other profit-generating activities had to be carried out in order for TGL’s business to be sustainable. They knew that the monies and markups received from the GD and GSS contracts were either left idle in TGL’s bank accounts, or were used to buy more gold bars to sell to clients under more GD and GSS contracts. In this regard, the admissions made by James and Sue in their statements to the CAD are telling.

> (a)     In James’ statement to the CAD, he recalled that “_there was a lot of cash in TGL bank account and felt that it didn’t make sense to have so much cash in the bank accounts when we did not have much stock_”.[\[note: 67\]](#Ftn_67) He also acknowledged that “_the markup collected from clients is sitting in the bank accounts of Singapore earning very low interest which is definitely not sufficient to cover the rebates due to clients and buy back their gold bars at contract expiry_”.[^68]

> (b)     In Sue’s statement to the CAD, when Sue was asked about the “formula” and how TGL would earn money, she explained that by purchasing additional gold bars using the markups or margins received, the monies and gold bar would be “_rolled_”.[\[note: 69\]](#Ftn_69) However, this “_does not allow TGL to earn money_” but merely to buy new gold bars and sell the gold bars to new clients as part of the gold buyback scheme.[^70]

50     Significantly, based on the daily reports sent by Joanne and Janet, it would have been obvious to James and Sue that there was no investment or substantive profit-generating business being conducted at all. For instance, James and Sue were updated with daily reports of the bank balance, the daily gold orders and the daily gold stock balance of TGL.[\[note: 71\]](#Ftn_71) This can be traced back to an email dated 22 January 2010, where Joanne sent an email to James, Sue, Gary and Thomson subject titled “Daily report from TGL SG_”_.[^72] In the email, Joanne stated “_as per James’s requests_”, she would send out daily summary reports showing TGL’s bank balances, daily orders and daily stock balances.

51     These daily summary reports show that TGL’s only business was to buy and sell gold bars under the GD and GSS contracts without investing the markups. From the bank balance tables, it would have been apparent that there were huge amounts of monies sitting in the bank accounts and not being invested. Further, there were no monies coming into TGL’s bank accounts from investments. James admitted, and it was evident, from the bank balance table that the only monies coming into TGL’s bank accounts were from cheques cleared from the sale of GD and GSS contracts.[\[note: 73\]](#Ftn_73)

52     I reject Sue’s defence that additional gold bars were bought as investments. This is a bare and unsupported allegation. As part of the daily reports, James and Sue would receive tables showing the stock balances of gold per day.[\[note: 74\]](#Ftn_74) These tables show the amount of excess gold bars TGL had in stock on any given day was not much, between 3kg to 9.5kg. According to Janet’s evidence, the company had only bought enough gold to “_cover \[the\] daily sales_”[^75] or to sufficiently cover the orders.[^76] Norman also confirmed that TGL did not buy extra gold bar for investment.[^77] The upshot of their evidence is that TGL had only bought gold bars to sell to clients as part of the gold buyback schemes. No gold bars were ever sold for investment purposes.

53     During cross-examination, both James and Sue cited various reasons as to why they had not read the reports or noticed the lack of investment activities. I find those to be merely self-serving excuses to downplay their degree of knowledge. James and Sue must have known about the lack of investments through these reports as they were intentionally synchronised[\[note: 78\]](#Ftn_78) with those in TGL Sdn Bhd for their benefit and ease of understanding.[^79] It is wholly inconceivable that they were completely unaware of the contents of these reports which were considered important enough to have been sent to them daily on their request.

### Knowledge after FTEG stopped running the “formula”

#### Workability of the “formula” was immaterial

54     I find that the Accused Persons allowed TGL to continue its operations despite knowing that there was no “formula”. According to Sue, Gary stopped running the “formula” and stopped coming into the office sometime around May 2010.[\[note: 80\]](#Ftn_80) James also stated in his statement to the CAD that by May/June 2010, FTEG was no longer operating the “formula” in TGL.[^81] At or around that time, Joanne also began to send emails stating that the “formula” was not being ran and that TGL’s business was suffering significant losses. One of the earliest emails was an email dated 9 June 2010 from Joanne to Gary, Thomson and Norman, with James and Sue in copy. In the email, Joanne expressed concern that the “formula” had not been running for a period of almost 3 weeks, and that TGL was projecting a negative cash position of $3.26 million for the month of June 2010.[^82]

55     Thus, by about May/June 2010, it would have been obvious to James and Sue, as well as TGL’s own employees, that there were grave doubts with regard to the profitability of the company because Gary had stopped running the “formula”. By this time, TGL would have totally lost all assurance that it could make profits from the revenue of the GD and GSS contracts. Yet, despite these developments, James and Sue continued with TGL’s sales of the GD and GSS contracts to new clients and incurred more buyback obligations for which there was no certainty in fulfilling. As highlighted by the Prosecution, the Accused Persons continued with TGL’s business operations because of their personal greed.[\[note: 83\]](#Ftn_83)

56     Given their complete indifference as to whether FTEG was running the “formula”, I am wholly unconvinced of the assertion by James and Sue that they believed the “formula” to be crucial in generating profits for TGL. On the evidence, it is clear that James and Sue already knew from the start that there was no profit-generating “formula” to begin with, and their subsequent decision to buy out FTEG’s shares and wind up the company reinforces this. I will now deal with their decision to buy out FTEG’s shares and wind up the company.

#### Decision to buy out FTEG’s shares and wind up the company

57     From August 2010 onwards, it would have been evident to James and Sue that there was a serious cash flow issue given the high sellback request from TGL’s clients. In an email dated 3 August 2010 sent by Joanne to James, Sue and Gary, it states:[\[note: 84\]](#Ftn_84)

> “Dear Directors, For your attention and advise as we are seeing higher sell back requests these 2 weeks (40% of total Aug’s due contracts) and expect to be facing cashflow problem very soon unless we convert Gold stock to cash…As of yesterday, we only have $5.144M (incl $1.9 in FD) in funds. I’ve not taken into consideration other expenses like incentives, bonus, operation expenses. Our low Sales collection is unable to support the cash flow requirement.”

58     With this email, James and Sue must have known that TGL was in dire financial straits with an impending cash flow problem. Additionally, one of the main sales agency (i.e. Wealth Foundation) had pulled out, and the clients’ sellback requests were kicking in.[\[note: 85\]](#Ftn_85) TGL was in a liquidity crisis. The time deposit of $1.9 million had to be withdrawn on 13 August 2010 (with zero interest earned) in order to raise enough cash to fulfil the company’s obligations under the buyback scheme.[^86] Notwithstanding TGL’s dire financial situation, James and Sue proceeded to buy out FTEG’s shares in TGL for $500,000. On 3 September 2010, Gary resigned as director of TGL and FTEG sold all its shares in TGL to James and Sue. On 7 October 2010, James and Sue initiated a winding up of TGL.[^87] By this time, TGL clearly did not have enough money to pay its obligations when they fall due. The Expert Report shows that on 7 October 2010, contracts representing sales value of approximately $76 million remain unfulfilled.[^88] TGL’s pay-out and buyback obligations to clients under these contracts amounted to over $85 million.[^89] However, TGL only had $452,364.28 in the bank accounts.[^90]

59     It would appear completely illogical for James and Sue to have bought over TGL’s shares from FTEG when it was precisely FTEG which had failed to run the “formula” and to perform the very role that it was tasked to do in TGL. If James and Sue had truly believed FTEG to have been running a profit-generating “formula”, the natural response would have been to seek recourse against Gary or FTEG for abdicating their responsibilities in TGL and ruining the company financially. However, instead of doing so, James and Sue paid half a million dollars to buy over FTEG’s shares in an ailing company, only for it to be wound up eventually.[\[note: 91\]](#Ftn_91) I accept that James and Sue were desperate to buy over FTEG’s shares in order to wind up the company. However, the circumstances and timing suggest they were anxious to wind up TGL owing to the inevitable uncovering of the fraudulent gold buyback scheme, and not because they believed the company could no longer make profits from the “formula”.

60     The Defence sought to portray James’ and Sue’s decision to wind up the company as benign efforts to make repayments to customers. It was highlighted that once it became obvious that Gary and Thomson would not be taking over TGL, in July 2010, both James and Sue took immediate steps to liquidate TGL and to inform TGL’s sales staff.[\[note: 92\]](#Ftn_92) It was submitted that as Gary had engaged auditors to evaluate the books of TGL prior to a potential takeover, it would be reasonable to assume that Gary and Thomson would be able to run the “formula” once they had assumed full control of TGL.[^93] This, according to the Defence, explained why James and Sue had not wound up the company earlier even though it was obvious by May/June 2010 that FTEG was no longer running the “formula”.

61     Such a charitable interpretation is, in my view, undeserved. At the outset, even though James and Sue claimed to have suggested to wind up the company sometime in July 2010, they only properly took steps to initiate a winding up on 7 October 2010.[\[note: 94\]](#Ftn_94) By then, Gary and FTEG had already decided not to buy over TGL, which meant that James and Sue could no longer avail themselves of the façade that TGL could make profits through the “formula”. The collapse of the entire charade would also have been imminently obvious to James and Sue, as TGL was critically unable to sustain its cash flow any longer. In these circumstances, James and Sue must have known that their game was up, and there was little option left but to buy out FTEG’s shares and to wind up the company. The timing of the winding up seems to indicate that their decision was not borne out of benevolence to save their clients, but desperation to cover up the Ponzi scheme that was soon to be exposed.

### Knowledge in the workability of the “formula”

#### Joseph’s assessment of TGL’s business model

62     One of the key defences raised by James and Sue was that they had trusted in or relied on Joseph’s assessment in the review of the “formula” because he was a Chartered Public Accountant.[\[note: 95\]](#Ftn_95) This is nothing more than a bald assertion. Despite bearing the evidential burden to prove any such reliance, the Defence had not called Joseph as a witness. On the other hand, the weight of the evidence adduced at trial militates against any finding that James and Sue had believed in the workability of the “formula” or relied on Joseph’s assessment.

63     First, James and Sue apparently left Joseph to review the “formula” despite knowing that Joseph did not have any experience in gold trading. After the review, Joseph simply said that the “formula” was “okay” without explaining how the “formula” would generate the necessary profits for TGL to pay the returns. James did not know, nor did he ask, what kind of assessment or calculation was done by Joseph to back up his conclusion.[\[note: 96\]](#Ftn_96) Sue also did not know how the “formula” would work, and did not know whether Joseph really understood the “formula”.[^97] In other words, neither James nor Sue knew why or how Joseph was convinced that the “formula” would work, and there was no substantive basis for them to have trusted Joseph’s assessment so readily.

64     Second, sometime in December 2009, Joseph had informed James and Sue that TGL’s business model was unsustainable and that the company would not have sufficient monies to fulfil its payment obligations to clients. Notwithstanding, James and Sue proceeded to commence business in TGL within the same month, in complete antithesis to the caution sounded by Joseph. I fail to see how James and Sue could realistically claim to have relied on Joseph’s assessment in the “formula” given these circumstances. They were willing to go along with his assessment and assurance when it suited their narrative, but ready to abandon his advice and ignore his caution when it did not.

#### Checks conducted with WongPartnership

65     Both James and Sue also made reference to the due diligence and background checks done with the authorities through WongPartnership LLP (“**WongPartnership**”) prior to the setting up of TGL. However, for two reasons, these checks simply could not have assisted in their defence.

66     First, it was clear that neither the authorities nor WongPartnership were asked to advise on the viability of TGL’s business model. The checks done with the authorities through WongPartnership merely pertained to licensing, compliance and/or regulatory requirements. WongPartnership was never engaged to review TGL’s business model. At any rate, there were no written documents from any authorities to show that there was any positive confirmation that TGL’s business model was viable.

67     Second, advice on the viability of TGL’s business model could not have been given as WongPartnership had not been provided with information on how TGL would make profits. This is corroborated by an email dated 22 June 2009 from WongPartnership to James, Sue and Joseph. In that email, WongPartnership attached a draft memorandum stating that they “_do not have the full description of the back-end trades proposed to be conducted by the Company_” and if TGL wanted advice on the back-end trades, WongPartnership required more information.[\[note: 98\]](#Ftn_98)

68     Sue claimed that it was Joseph who explained TGL’s business model to the lawyers.[\[note: 99\]](#Ftn_99) Joanne also testified that Joseph was the only one who explained TGL’s business model to WongPartnership.[^100] I find it hard to believe that Sue was completely uninvolved in these meetings. Her name was present in all the email correspondences with WongPartnership, and there were emails from WongPartnership which distinctively began with “_Dear Sue_” or stated “_\[f\]urther to your and James’ elaboration on the company’s proposed business_”.[^101] These emails suggest that Sue was not merely a passive participant in the meetings. In her own capacity, Sue had also replied to some of WongPartnership’s emails.[^102] Even if Joseph had been the main presenter in some of these meetings, I find that Sue must have known and contributed to what was being represented to WongPartnership of a company of which she was (or was to be) a director.

69     The Defence contended that the conduct of James and Sue is inconsistent with that of persons who intended to operate a fraudulent scheme from the outset, since any engagement with the authorities would inevitably have the effect of drawing unwanted attention to their fraudulent enterprise.[\[note: 103\]](#Ftn_103) This contention may have some merit if they had provided a complete and honest disclosure of the TGL’s business model. However in the present case, James and Sue had not even provided an accurate picture of TGL’s business to WongPartnership or the authorities. The representations made to the authorities and WongPartnership[^104] differed in material aspects from how TGL operated in practice and in any event did not seem to be based on the Sheng & Co Document.

70     The Defence argued that obtaining advice from WongPartnership was not part of an attempt to cover TGL’s scheme with a veneer of legitimacy.[\[note: 105\]](#Ftn_105) I disagree. On the facts, it cannot be denied that TGL actively presented itself as a “legitimate business”. The first slide immediately after “Why buy from The Gold Label” in the PowerPoint slides puts forward TGL as a “legitimate business” as it “abides by the laws of Singapore in its business operations and has sought further clarification with financial authorities”.[^106] Again, in the FAQ portion of the PowerPoint slides, it was represented that TGL is a “legitimate business that is in compliance with the laws of the relevant authorities”.[^107] The checks conducted through WongPartnership would conveniently and superficially lend support to TGL’s claims of being a “legitimate business”, without having to go into details on what was exactly verified to be in “compliance with the laws of the relevant authorities”.

#### Value brought by FTEG and the “formula”

71     According to the Defence, it would have served no purpose for James and Sue to give up half of the income for TGL’s business and significant management control of TGL unless they took the view that Gary and Thomson brought value to TGL’s business.[\[note: 108\]](#Ftn_108) This is an ingenious argument, but does not accord with the realities of the deception being perpetrated. While FTEG and the “formula” did not provide any intrinsic value in terms of profit-generation, in my view they played a pivotal function in setting up the illusion that TGL’s gold buyback scheme was profitable and sustainable. The ability for James and Sue to make financial gains through TGL’s sales depended crucially on the façade that was provided by FTEG and the “formula”.[^109] In order to maintain this false front, FTEG would have had to hold substantial shareholdings in TGL, and its members be seen to have management control of the company.

72     The Defence also argued that if James and Sue knew from the start that the “formula” did not in fact generate any returns, there would have been no reason to maintain FTEG’s server and room within TGL’s premises.[\[note: 110\]](#Ftn_110) Again, this argument is completely at odds with how the deceit in TGL was carried out. Having a “secretive room”[^111] that was reserved for FTEG’s use precisely played into the façade of a mysterious “formula” that can generate profits, and allowed TGL to conceal its lack of a legitimate business behind the smokescreen of “confidentiality”. In this regard, Gordon[^112] and Yao Shih Lien[^113] (PW2) gave evidence to the effect that James and Sue would cite “confidentiality” or “trade secret” as a reason for not divulging further details on how profits are generated using the “formula”.

73     For the avoidance of doubt, I also reject the allegation that the Accused Persons were deceived by Gary into believing that there was a “formula” to generate investment returns. This allegation is contrary to the parties’ IT Services Agreement dated 11 May 2009.[\[note: 114\]](#Ftn_114) The other reason was the conduct of the Accused Persons after it came to their attention that there was no formula. In this respect, I note that despite knowing that TGL was being investigated by CAD, the Accused Persons continued to agree to pay Gary for the sale of the TGL shares. James also asked for extension of the payment in a letter dated 7 September 2011[^115] which made no reference to the “formula” at all. Finally, the Accused Persons could not have been deceived by Gary as they could not even describe how the “formula” could generate investment returns.

74     The overall picture which emerges points irresistibly and inexorably towards the conclusion that James and Sue knew from the start that TGL’s business model was unsustainable, and that there was no profit-generating “formula” to begin with. Contrary to their unfounded allegation that they were deceived by Gary, the overwhelming evidence demonstrates that James and Sue knew the arrangements with FTEG and the “formula” to be nothing more than a façade to cloak the business of TGL with a veneer of legitimacy. With this artifice, they dishonestly allowed the gold buyback scheme to be falsely marketed to sales agents, employees and clients.

75     In all the circumstances and for the reasons given above, I find that between 16 December 2009 and 7 October 2010, James and Sue were knowingly parties to the carrying on of the business of TGL for the Fraudulent Purpose. I am also of the view that the _mens rea_ element for both Accused Persons is established beyond a reasonable doubt.

## Conclusion

76     In conclusion, the charges against both Accused Persons have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I find them guilty on their respective charges and convict them of the same.
