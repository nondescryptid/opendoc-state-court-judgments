### District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt:

## Introduction

1       The accused, a 57 year-old male Singaporean, was the Vice-Principal of a local primary school. He took the victim, a young boy and foreign student in his school, under his wings by mentoring and tutoring him. The accused eventually became the victim’s guardian. The victim moved in to live with the accused, who is single and lived with his parents. The accused abused his relationship of trust and authority vis-à-vis the victim and committed sexual offences against the victim. These offences were committed over a number of years from 2003 when the victim was 14 years old and continued until he was 17 years old and beyond.

2       The accused was charged for eight offences. He was represented by counsel and claimed trial to the charges, denying that he had committed the offences. At the conclusion of the trial, he was convicted of three charges under s 7 of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap. 38, 2001 Rev Ed) (“CYPA”) and five charges under s 377 of the Penal Code (1985 Rev. Ed.)(“Penal Code” or “PC”). He was sentenced to **10 years’ imprisonment** in total. One charge under s 377 PC was withdrawn by the prosecution and two charges under the Films Act were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentence.

3       The accused appealed against both his conviction and sentence. He is presently on bail pending the appeal.

## Charges

After the accused was convicted of the 1st to 8th charges, he admitted to and consented for two outstanding charges, for possession of obscene materials under the Films Act, to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentence.[^1]

5       The two sets of charges under s 7 CYPA and s 377 PC are similarly worded, save for the details as summarised in the table above. For ease of reference, I will set out one charge under s 7 CYPA and one charge under s 377 PC (both redacted) as follows:

> First Charge

> You…are are charged that you, sometime in 2003, in the school gym of XXX Primary School, Singapore, did commit an indecent act with a young person, namely one XXX (DOB: XXX 1989), to wit, by stroking the said XXX’s penis, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 7 of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38, 2001 Rev Ed).

> Fourth Charge

> You…are are charged that you, on 3 November 2005, at XXX, Singapore, did voluntarily have carnal intercourse against the order of nature with one XXX (DOB: XXX 1989), to wit, by performing fellatio on the said XXX, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 377 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed).

## The Prosecution’s Case

### Prosecution Witnesses

6       The Prosecution called four witnesses. They were the victim, the victim’s wife, the accused’s niece (“N”), and the investigating officer of the case (the “IO”).[^2]

### The Prosecution’s Case and Evidence

7       The prosecution’s case and evidence is set out in some detail in the prosecution’s closing submission.[^3] I have summarised and highlighted the following facts which I consider to be material.

#### Victim’s evidence

8       The offences were committed against victim from 2003 when he was a primary school student. By the time the victim took the stand to give evidence in court at the trial, he was already an adult. He is also married and a qualified medical doctor.

##### Start of victim’s relationship with the accused

9       The victim was a foreign national from China. He came to Singapore with his mother when he was nine years old. He enrolled in a local primary school and started in Primary 1. The school eventually merged with another school of which the accused was the Vice-Principal (“VP”). In 2003 when the victim was in Primary 5, he was appointed by the accused as vice-head prefect of the school. As the vice-head prefect, the victim had to see the accused in his office every morning before school assembly. Over time, the victim regarded the accused as a mentor.

##### 2003 – 1st charge

10     The victim testified as to the circumstances that led to the offence in the first charge in 2003. That year, the victim was involved in a school activity (essentially a mass participation workout event) which the accused was in charge of organising. The victim was one of a select group of facilitators and had to go to school on Saturdays for rehearsals.

11     On one of these rehearsal days, the victim went to school early and met the accused in his office. The accused then instructed the victim to proceed to the school gym to do some warm-up exercises whilst waiting for him. The accused arrived shortly in the gym. There was no one else other than the two of them. The accused then pushed the victim against the wall. He lowered the victim’s shorts and underwear and touched and stroked the victim’s penis. The accused also stroked his own penis and ejaculated.

12     The victim was 14 years old at the time of this offence. He did not know how to react and because of the accused’s position of authority, the victim was also afraid that no one would believe him even if reported the accused.

##### 2004 – 2nd and 3rd charge

13     The next two offences occurred the following year in 2004 when the victim was in Primary 6. He was, by then, appointed head prefect of the school. He continued to report to the accused every morning before school assembly in the latter’s office. In the course of the year, the accused offered to tutor the victim one-to-one in English. While the victim was more than competent with the other subjects, he was understandably weak in English given the fact that was a foreign student. The victim also started to visit the accused’s flat for private tuition.

14     The private tuition was conducted in the study room in the accused’s flat. On the first or second occasion after the tuition session, the accused invited the victim into to his bedroom to watch TV. The accused then showed the victim articles on masturbation which the accused kept in his room. These articles were seized from the accused’s bedroom and admitted in evidence.[^4] The accused assured the victim that masturbation was normal and that it was healthy for men to masturbate one another to release their sexual urges. The accused then reached into victim’s underwear and fondled and stroked the victim’s penis. The victim endured the act by imagining in his mind that he was being touched by a female. By doing so, he eventually ejaculated. Thereafter, the victim went to the toilet to wash up and the accused brought him to KFC. This incident formed the subject-matter of the second charge.

15     The victim visited the accused’s flat again the following weekend for tuition. He watched TV in the accused’s bedroom on the bed after tuition. The victim loved to watch TV. After a while, the accused laid down next to the victim. He told the victim that he loved him very much, and went on top of the victim and tried to kiss him on the mouth. The victim felt uncomfortable and kept his mouth closed. The accused then pulled up the victim’s shirt and pulled down his pants and underwear, and also undressed himself. The accused then stroked the victim’s penis. After that, the accused went on top of the victim and rubbed his penis against the victim’s abdomen, until he ejaculated. Thereafter, the accused wiped the victim’s body with a towel. They dressed themselves, and the accused brought the victim out to eat at KFC. This incident related to the third charge.

16     The victim continued to visit the accused’s home on weekends for private tuition. He testified that the accused would perform such sexual acts on him after tuition.

##### Victim moves in to stay with accused

17     Towards the end of 2004 and after the victim had sat for his PSLE examinations, the victim needed a place to stay because his then guardian had been repatriated by ICA. The victim approached the accused who took over guardianship of the victim and asked the victim to move into his flat to live with the accused sometime in early 2005. The victim testified that he felt honoured and privileged to be able to move in to live with the accused and was happy to have found a new home.

18     The victim testified as to the sleeping arrangement when he moved into the accused’s flat. Even though he kept his belongings in a spare room[^5], he slept in the accused’s room with the accused.[^6]

19     The accused’s parents slept in another room. The victim got along very well with the accused’s parents. He regarded them like his own grandparents.[^7] He also looked up to the accused as a fatherly figure.[^8] The accused also became more affectionate and insisted that the victim sign off his text messages to the accused with “I love you.”[^9]

##### 2005-6: 4th to 8th charge

20     The accused engaged in sexual acts with the victim in his bedroom which culminated in the accused having oral sex with one another. The victim recalled that the first time this happened was in early 2005. The victim testified as follows:

> ASo, Mr GCF will kiss me on my lip, say that he love me. He will take out my shirt, take out my…take out my pants and underwear. Then he will perform oral sex on me.

> QOkay. When you say “perform oral sex on you,” can you just give me a specific description of this action?

> ASo he will…he will put his mouth on my penis and then go on the up and down motion when I…I am lying down.

> QWould he ask you for your permission to…before he does this?

> ANo, I didn’t recall him ask me asking me for a permission.[^10]

21     The victim testified that thereafter, the accused coaxed the victim to perform oral sex on the accused:

> ASo after that, he will..he encouraged me to do the same thing on him.

> QOkay.

> AYah, so for the first incident, I…I remember…so after that he lied down and he asked me to… to do the same thing on him. And then I was a bit hesitant so he…basically, he showed me how to do it. So he..he put his hand on my head and pushed it down to show me how.. how.. how it should be done.[^11]

##### These acts formed the subject-matter of the 6th and 7th charge.

22     The accused engaged with oral sex with the victim once every week or every two weeks. In addition to oral sex, the accused would also lie on top of the victim and sexually arouse himself by rubbing his penis against the victim’s abdomen. The accused would encourage the victim to the same to him. The victim was led to believe that the accused was helping the victim to relieve his sexual urges. The victim would imagine that he was performing these acts with a female. There was an occasion when he had to write a letter to the accused to apologise for fantasising about having sex with a female when he was having oral sex with the accused. This letter was found in the accused’s bedroom and admitted in evidence.[^12]

23     The victim specifically recalled and testified that they had mutual fellatio as well as masturbation on Hari Raya Puasa that year i.e. 3 November 2005. These sexual acts which occurred in the accused’s bedroom in the late afternoon formed the subject-matter of the fourth and fifth charge.

24     The following year in 2006, the victim was in Secondary 3. The accused continued to engage in oral sex with the victim but less frequently. The victim started to doubt whether the sexual acts with the accused was normal. That year, the victim recalled that they had oral sex again on Hari Raya Puasa i.e. 24 October 2006. The sexual acts, which again occurred in the accused’s bedroom in the late afternoon, formed the subject-matter of the eighth charge.

##### 2013 – victim left the accused

25     The victim testified that as he became older from 2007, he tried to distance himself more and more from the accused’s sexual advances. He increasingly declined and resisted the accused’s sexual demands. Nonetheless, he would still give in and allow the accused to perform the sexual acts on him because the accused would use emotional blackmail. Even then, the frequency of the sexual acts decreased. Even though the victim did not want to engage in sexual acts with the accused, the victim felt obligated because of all that the accused had done for him. Further, the victim recalled that the accused was warded in hospital in the ICU due to a heart condition towards the end of 2007. Because of the accused’s weakened health, the victim felt even more indebted to the accused.

26     The victim went on to study in junior college in 2008-9. By this time, the accused demanded very much less from the victim sexually and in any case, the victim was old enough to realise that the accused had lied about the propriety of what they were doing. The victim thought about moving out but did not know how he was able to do that. Financial means aside, he still felt obligated to the accused and was also close to the accused’s parents whom he helped to care for.

27     In 2010, the victim got into medical school at NUS having done well for his ‘A’ level examinations.

28     There were certain events thereafter which made the victim decide to leave the accused. One such event was that the victim discovered in 2011 that he had contracted gonorrhoea urethritis, a sexually transmitted disease. This discovery made him re-evaluate his relationship with the accused. It made him realise that he had to protect himself and not accede to the accused’s sexual demands anymore.

29     The second event occurred in June 2013 when the victim accompanied the accused on a tour to Scandinavia during which he met “X” who eventually became his wife. The victim dated X without telling the accused after they returned from the tour. The victim then confided in X about the sexual acts that the accused did with the victim. X urged the victim to move out of the flat and to make a police report. The victim was reluctant to make a police report but did eventually moved out sometime in the second half of 2013 to stay with X and her parents.

30     The victim told a white lie to the accused that he (the victim) had informed the victim’s parents about what the accused had done and that they were very upset and wanted the victim to move out. On hearing this, the accused asked the victim seek forgiveness from his parents and begged the victim not to report to the police. If not, he would end his life.

##### 2015 – victim’s chance encounter with accused’s niece

31     The victim completed his medical studies and graduated in the middle of 2015. He then started his housemanship that year at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital. Sometime in August, he bumped into N, the accused’s niece, who was a social worker at the said hospital. N asked why the victim had decided to move out of the accused’s flat. After some deliberation, the victim decided to tell N about what the accused had done. N said that what the accused did was wrong and advised the victim to make a police report because the accused may well have done similar acts to other boys.

32     The victim felt that the conversation with N mitigated his guilt for leaving the accused and abandoning the accused’s parents. The victim also felt that he needed to seek closure and contemplated making a police report.

##### Alleged extortion and police report

33     The victim was not prepared to make a police report against the accused. He was worried that if the matter came to light, it would not be pleasant for him or the accused and the accused’s parents. He also did not want his own parents to find out about what happened to him and cause them to feel guilty about leaving him to fend for himself in Singapore.

34     He discussed with X about what to do. He also sought some informal legal advice from a friend (a law student) about the criminal process if he were to make a police report against the accused. Finally, he decided to contact the accused to ask for compensation as a form of ‘out-of-court’ settlement. He thought this was the best course of action to seek closure but yet not subject the accused and himself to the full criminal process.

35     The victim texted the accused on 3 November 2015 to confront the accused and asked him for compensation for his acts. The text exchange was followed up with a telephone conversation the following day on 4 November 2015. The victim recorded the said conversation. Both the text messages and phone conversation were not disputed and admitted as evidence. The victim told a white lie informing the accused that it was the victim’s parents who wanted to pursue the matter and seek $200,000 compensation from the accused.

36     The victim wanted an apology from the accused. He also wanted the accused to admit that what he had done to the victim was wrong and to promise not to do such acts to other boys. When asked why he decided on the amount of $200,000, the victim explained that the amount had to be punitive so as not to go easy on the accused and high enough to compensate the victim for the many years of sexual violation which he suffered. In addition, he said that X also did some research which showed that the said quantum would be appropriate.

37     However, the accused gave excuses to delay paying the victim. In truth, the accused was seeking legal advice and leading the victim on. He finally agreed to meet the victim on the pretence of wanting to pay the compensation but it was instead a set-up for the accused’s lawyers to serve a “cease and desist” letter on the victim on 24 November 2015.[^13] Having realised that the accused had out-manoeuvred him and had no intention to make any amends for his wrongdoing, the victim then decided to lodge a police report against the accused on 25 November 2015 for the sexual acts committed against the victim.

### Evidence of the Other Witnesses

#### Victim’s wife

38     The victim’s wife, X, confirmed that she met the victim in 2013 and they got married in 2016 after about three years of courtship.[^14] She first met him when she went on a tour with her family to Scandinavia. The victim and her were the only two young people in the tour group and so they got along quite well. However, she also sensed and saw that the accused was unhappy that the victim was paying so much attention to her.

39     After the tour, she remained in contact with the victim and they started dating. When they became a couple, the accused finally told her what the accused had done to him. She advised him to move out of the accused’s flat and to make a police report. X also testified that they discussed and decided to ask the accused for an ‘out-of-court’ settlement. She was the one who proposed the compensation sum of $200,000.

#### Accused’s niece

40     The accused’s niece, N, confirmed that she had a chance meeting with the victim along the corridors of KK Hospital in August 2015. She was then working as a medical social worker. The victim told her that he was sexually abused by the accused. She advised the victim to consider making a police report.

## Close of Prosecution’s Case

41     At the close of the prosecution’s case, the prosecution withdrew the ninth charge against the accused.[^15] Counsel for the defence did not make any submission of no case to answer. In the circumstances and given that there was prima facie evidence to support the key elements of the remaining eight charges at the close of the prosecution’s case, I called on the accused to give his defence to the said charges.

## The Defence

42     The accused elected to give his evidence on oath. The accused also called three of his family members (i.e. mother, brother and brother-in-law) as defence witnesses. The testimonies of the accused and the defence witnesses are comprehensively set out in counsel’s closing submission to which I have referred in summarising the defence’s evidence and case.[^16]

### The Accused’s Evidence

43     The accused is 57 years old. He graduated in 2000 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English Literature and became a teacher in 1984. He rose through the ranks and became the VP of the victim’s primary school in 2014. In the course of his teaching career, he received a number of awards from the government and other government bodies.

44     In a nutshell, the accused’s defence was a complete denial of the charges. He claimed that he (and his family) had treated the victim as a member of the family. He denied committing the sexual acts with or against the victim. In fact, the victim betrayed the accused’s love and generosity by leaving the flat suddenly and has now made these false allegations and had also tried to extort money from him.

45     The circumstances leading up to the accused taking the victim under his wings and being his guardian are not materially disputed. The accused was the VP of the primary school where the victim was enrolled as a student. The accused saw that the victim, being a foreigner, had difficulties with the English language. The victim was three years older that his Primary 3 cohort. The accused decided to give the victim tuition early in the morning before the school session began. After some time, he tutored the victim privately in the accused’s own flat.

46     In respect of the first charge which allegedly took place in the school gymnasium, the accused testified that the gymnasium was electronically locked and accessible only with a card key (i.e. Civil Service Card). Contrary to what the victim said, the accused claimed that he did not hand over or lend his card to the victim for the victim to enter the gymnasium. The offence did not take place and certainly could not have taken place in the school gymnasium.

47     The accused also testified as to the circumstances when he became the victim’s guardian. He said that the victim’s original guardian was blacklisted and could no longer be the victim’s guardian. The victim was then at the ICA and desperately called accused for assistance. After consulting the principal of the school, the accused decided to become the victim’s guardian. The accused said he had no ulterior motive in doing so.

48     The accused also claimed that the victim was given his own room when the victim moved in to live with the accused. The accused denied sleeping in the same room with the victim. As such, the victim lied in his testimony about all the sexual misconduct that had allegedly happened in the accused’s bedroom. Furthermore, the victim would have had sex education classes even in primary school and therefore would have known the difference between appropriate and inappropriate sexual behaviour.

49     The accused further led evidence of the numerous occasions that he had gone on overseas holidays with the victim. The photographs taken on these trips were admitted in evidence.[^17] The accused’s parents came along on some of the trips. On other trips, the accused brought only the victim. On most if not all trips, the accused shared the same room with the victim. Photographs of the family celebrations during Hari Raya in 2005 and 2010 and other family gatherings were also tendered in evidence.[^18] In addition, the accused provided various letters and notes of appreciation which were given to him by the victim over the years.[^19] The point being made by the accused in tendering the aforementioned evidence was that his relationship with the victim had always been respectful, happy and uneventful and that there were no allegations that he had committed any sexual act with the victim until now.

50     The accused said he had caned the victim on some occasions when he tutored the victim in the past. The accused claimed he thought the victim wanted compensation because of the caning inflicted by the accused. In any case, the accused surmised that the victim has made up these allegations to extort money from him.

51     The defence countered the victim’s allegations by asserting that the victim was in need of money because he had purchased an apartment and also needed to pay off his university tuition fee loan (“TFL”).[^20] The defence counter-alleged that the victim (in collusion with his wife) then tried to black-mail and extort money from the accused. The screen-shots of the text exchange between the accused and the victim were tendered in evidence.[^21]

### The Defence Witnesses

52     The three defence witnesses (i.e. accused’s mother, sister and brother-in-law) were called by the defence to discredit the victim’s evidence. They essentially testified that the victim slept in a separate room from the accused.

## The Court’s Findings and Decision

### The Offences at the Material Time

53     The first three charges are for offences of sexual exploitation of a young person under s 7 of the CYPA. At the time of the commission of the offences in 2003 and 2004, this section read as follows:

> Any person who, in public or private, commits or abets the commission of or procures or attempts to procure the commission by any person of any obscene or indecent act with any child or young person shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 4 years or to both.

54     The 4th to 8th charges are for offences of carnal intercourse against the order of nature under s 377 of the Penal Code. At the time of the commission of the offences in 2005 and 2006, this section read as follows:

> Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animals, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine.

55     In respect of s 377 of the Penal Code, the law regarded the act of fellatio as unnatural carnal intercourse within the ambit of s 377. Consent was irrelevant, and the only exception was where a man and a woman willingly engaged in fellatio as a stimulant for consensual sexual intercourse: _PP v Kwan Kwong Weng_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 1 SLR(R) 316</span> at \[25\]-\[31\]; _Lim Hock Hin Kelvin v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 1 SLR(R) 37</span> at \[16\].

56     The original provision under s 377 Penal Code that is relevant to the present charges has been repealed in 2007 and the act of fellatio is now punishable (i) under s 376 Penal Code if non-consensual; (ii) under s376A Penal Code if committed against a person under 16 years regardless of consent; and (iii) under s377A between two male persons regardless of age and consent.

### The Law on Assessing Credibility of a Victim of Sexual Offence

57     In general, the Evidence Act does not specify that a fact must be proved by more than one witness.[^22] There is also no legal principle that prohibits the conviction of an accused on the evidence of a single witness, even if that witness is the victim of a sexual offence. However, the court ought generally to be aware of the inherent danger in doing so. The court must evaluate and scrutinise the evidence of the witness very carefully and thereafter decide if the testimony is so compelling to the extent that a conviction may be justified entirely, if necessary, on that testimony.

58     As in many cases of sexual offences, this case ultimately turned on the victim’s allegations against the accused’s denials. The prosecution’s case is largely premised on the veracity and accuracy of the victim’s testimony. The court has to decide beyond reasonable doubt whether the accused had committed the sexual offences as alleged in the eight charges.

59     In the case of a sexual offence where there is no other corroborative evidence and the court has to rely substantially, if not entirely, on the evidence of the victim in order to convict the accused, the legal test is that the victim’s evidence must be unusually convincing or compelling in order to sustain a conviction of the charge beyond reasonable doubt (see generally _Khoo Kwoon Hain v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] 2 SLR 767</span>_; PP v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 601</span> (“_Mohammed Liton_”)).

60     The phrase “unusually convincing” was explained by the Court of Appeal (“CA”) in _Mohammed Liton_ at \[39\]:

> In our view, therefore, the “extra something” implied by the word “unusually” must refer to the need for the trial judge to be aware of the dangers of convicting solely on the complainant’s testimony as well as of the importance of convicting only on testimony that, when weighted against the overall backdrop of the available facts and circumstances, contains that ring of truth which leaves the court satisfied that no reasonable doubt exists in favour of the accused.

61     The phrase was also explained by the CA in _AOF v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 34</span> (“_AOF_”) at \[115\] as follows:

> It is clear that a witness’ testimony may only be found to be “unusually convincing” by weighing the demeanour of the witness alongside both the internal and external consistencies found in the witness’ testimony.

62     If the testimony of the victim is not ‘unusually convincing’, the CA in _AOF_ then laid out the approach at \[173\] – \[175\] to determine what constitutes corroboration in a sexual offence. The CA held that the approach to locating corroborative evidence is liberal so that the trial judge has the necessary flexibility to treat relevant evidence as corroborative. The court stated that what is important is the substance as well as the relevance of the evidence, and whether it is supportive or confirmative of the weak evidence which it is meant to corroborate.

63     The overall approach to be taken in cases of sexual offences is well encapsulated in _Tang Kin Seng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 3 SLR(R) 444</span> (“_Tang Kin Seng_”) at \[39\] and \[44\]:

> In a trial for sexual offences, what is important is that the evidence is weighed carefully, always bearing in mind the relevant aspects of human nature and behaviour. It would be wrong to be bogged down by technicalities especially when it has no logical problem at hand…

> In my view, the right approach is to analyse the evidence for the prosecution and for the defence, and decide whether the complainant's evidence is so reliable that a conviction based solely on it is not unsafe. If it is not, it is necessary to identify which aspect of it is not so convincing and for which supporting evidence is required or desired. In assessing the supporting evidence, the question then is whether this supporting evidence makes up for the weakness in the complainant's evidence. All these would, of course, have to be done in light of all the circumstances of each case and all the evidence, including the defence evidence, as well as accumulated knowledge of human behaviour and common sense.

### General Principles on Assessing Credibility

64     The test in respect of the testimony of a sexual offence victim is but an extension of the application of the general principle that the credibility of a witness is to be assessed by the witness’s demeanour, the internal consistency and external consistency between the witness’s evidence and other extrinsic objective evidence (see _Farida Begam d/o Mohd Artham v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 592</span>; _Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 45</span>).

65     In observing and assessing a witness’s credibility from his demeanour, the CA in _Sandz Solutions Strategic and Others v Worldwide Assets Limited_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGCA 27</span> (“_Sandz Solutions Strategic_”) at \[46\] further cautioned that such observation should seldom be the sole basis on which the court determines the credibility of a witness and the veracity of his evidence.

66     Ultimately, there will likely be discrepancies and inconsistencies in any witness’s testimony. As such, the court must recognise and give reasonable allowance for human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection. In this regard, the CA in _Sandz Solutions Strategic_ at \[56\] highlighted the danger of over-reliance on the recollection of witnesses on the witness stand. The CA held that a witness should not be judged to be less credible merely because of gaps in his memory, particularly where a long period of time has passed since the occurrence of the events in question. Ultimately, the trial judge has to consider the _totality_ of the evidence in determining the veracity, reliability and credibility of a particular witness’s evidence.

67     With these general and specific principles in mind, I proceed to assess the veracity, reliability and credibility of the victim in this case.

### Victim’s Evidence Compelling and Unusually Convincing

68     While the offences were committed against the victim when he was a boy, by the time he gave his testimony in court, he was already a mature adult. Being a qualified medical professional, he was also articulate and able to express his feelings and thoughts clearly. He was more than capable of fending off counsel’s cross-examination because he spoke the truth and was absolutely convincing in his testimony. I assessed that the victim was a witness who has decided to put aside all feelings of shame and embarrassment so as to lay bare all the private and sexually intimate acts that had transpired in the bedroom between the accused and him. He also candidly revealed his discovery of having contracted a sexually-transmitted disease which prompted him to re-assess his relationship with and loyalty to the accused. As the accused was unrepentent and has refused to admit his wrongdoing and in fact turned the table on the victim with a ‘cease and desist’ letter, the victim therefore had nothing more to lose. I had no difficulty according full weight to the victim’s testimony because I found him to be brutally direct, nakedly honest and entirely forthright.

#### Internally and Externally Consistent

69     I found that his evidence was both internally and externally consistent. He gave a completely coherent and logical explanation to all the questions asked of him during examination-in-chief or thrown at him during cross-examination. He was resolute and unwavering in his accusations and allegations against the accused. I believed his evidence as to what transpired and as regards all the sexual acts that he testified had occurred. He was able to fully articulate and explain his thought processes and emotions at various stages of his life and of his relationship with the accused. I believed his evidence that initially, he accommodated and agreed to the sexual acts with the accused. This was due in part to his young age in the initial stages and the fact that the accused had led him to believe that what they were doing was normal. The defence contended that the victim has had sex education in school and would have known what was inappropriate sexual conduct. This was not put to the victim. Otherwise, I am certain that the victim would have been able to rebut that contention. Even if it was true that there was sex education in school, the reality was that the accused was the VP of the school and his position of authority and influence over the victim and trust that the victim had in the accused would have assuaged any doubts that the victim might have harboured, regardless of any textbook sex education. In any case, in the later stages when the victim became older, he resisted and declined, as much as he could, to engage in any more sexual acts with the accused.

70     The victim also testified that from around 2006, he suspected that the accused was gay because the accused would visit and chat on gay forums on the internet.[^23] The victim testified that he then realised that the accused’s had misinformed him about masturbation due to the accused’s sexual orientation:

> So because when Mr GCF showed me the articles plus telling me about “it’s normal for guys to masturbate with noth”---“with another guy”, I---it didn’t occur to me somehow that he is gay. I didn’t know that---because if I know that, then it may change what I---how---how---how gullible I am to believe what he’s---what he tell me. It only occurred to me later on in---when I moved on to Secondary 3 when I chanced upon those website that---that he had---he is actually of a different sexual orientation as me.

It is worth noting that the victim’s suspicion of the accused’s sexual orientation was not challenged.

71     I believed and accepted that the victim was torn between feeling both respect for the accused (as his guardian and VP of the school) and gratitude to him (for taking him into his home and providing him financially) on the one hand and wanting to stop the sexual acts because it was wrong and especially after he met and started a heterosexual relationship with his present wife. I believed that he tried to decline having oral sex with the accused as he got older but I accepted his explanation that the accused would use a mixture of gaslighting, threats and emotional blackmail to get his way. The victim described how he was psychologically pressured and manipulated would give in to the accused:

> Because from---from the beginning until---until just before I moved out, I am already---I am already under the pressure that---I feel that whatever things I do I cannot make him dis---I cannot disappoint him. And I feel---I feel---I feel very hard to---to---to say no or to disappoint him because whenever that happens, he will just---he will just become, like, very, very, very upset. It’s just not---not normal “normal” type of upset. He will---like, for instance, I will be lying on my bed and then I will be focusing, thinking, oh, tomorrow I got my exam coming, I want to---I want to have a---enough rest. And then he will be there, he want to satisfy his sexual urge, he will just---he start kissing me and start going on top of me. And when I refused, he would turn very, very angry. He will---he will say, “Oh, okay, never mind, I will”---“I’ll”---“I”---“I will”---“I will go out to the”---“to the”---“to the hall and sleep on the sofa instead.” Then he will go out on the sofa---go out of the hall---I mean, go out of the room and sleep on the sofa. Then after that, I just, “Oh, okay, can,” I will just continue sleeping. Then I continue sleep, continue sleep. Then after that, he will just come by and start---start talking to me, like, when I am sleeping he say, “So you just let”---“you just let me”---“let me sleep”---“sleep on the sofa?” Then I will feel like, “Now, what is happening?” Like, “Why are you, like, you know, blaming me for”---“for this type of thing?” I---as I---in my---in my mind, I jus---I just want to focus and want to do well in my exam nex---the next day. So this is the type of thing that he will constantly do to guilt trip me. Then he will always also say, “Oh, you know, without me, you know, your”---“you may not be here. You may be the same fate as your mother. My family and my”---“and myself have helped you so much.” So constantly, I feel this sense of---like I owed them a lot of things. I can---there is no way for me to repay all their kindness and all the things that they have helped me.[^24]

72     The victim had also grown close to the accused’s parents and treated them as family. For all these reasons and conflicting emotions, he wanted to but could not bring himself to move out of the accused’s flat until he became much older. For the same reasons, he was even more reluctant to lodge a police report against the accused.

#### Why Victim Asked Accused for Compensation

73     I accepted the circumstances and reasons which finally prompted the victim, in November 2015 after all these years, to confront the accused for having committed the sexual acts. I did not find that the victim was trying to extort money from the accused.

74     The victim was prepared to risk damaging his professional career and reputation and endure embarrassment and public scrutiny in order to seek some form of closure. I accepted that the victim regretted asking the accused for $200,000 as compensation. It was certainly not his proudest moment. In his mind, it was the ‘best’ option that he could think of in trying to avoid blowing up the whole matter but yet getting the accused to admit his wrongdoing and also holding him accountable for the sexual acts committed with the young victim. However, it finally hit home that the accused was merely toying with the victim, leading him on to think that the accused was perhaps open to negotiating a settlement. That was when the victim decided to lodge the police report.

75     I further found that the victim was objective and gave credit where credit is due. He readily and gratefully acknowledged all that the accused and his family members had done and provided for him. He was not the least spiteful or vindictive. I could sense a palpable tinge of sadness in the victim for having to reveal and make these allegations against the accused. The accused simply left him no other choice even though he knew how the allegations would hurt the accused’s parents whom the victim had grown to love and care for. It pained the victim to have to testify against the accused. He was not out to besmirch the good name of the accused. In fact, it was obvious that the victim was very restrained (albeit truthful and objective) in his allegations. He testified as to what he could recall and would not embellish or exaggerate his evidence. This is probably why the number of charges are limited to only those tendered against the accused. Given the nature and length of the relationship between the accused and the victim and the apparent frequency of the sexual acts, the prosecution could have, if there was embellishment from the victim, tendered many more charges. The victim’s candour was probably also the reason why the ninth charge was withdrawn at the close of the prosecution’s case.

76     I therefore found the victim’s evidence to be extremely honest, unwavering, consistent and compelling, and I accorded full weight to his testimony.

77     The defence sought to discredit the victim’s allegations by painting a picture of a happy relationship between the accused and the victim, at least until the victim decided to move out, and that there were no adverse allegations until now. However, as observed in _Tang Kin Seng_ at \[79\], there may be very good reasons why a sexual offence victim would react or not react in ways which appear to deviate from expected or common human experience. Victims of sexual crimes cannot be predicted or straightjacketed to act or react in a certain manner. There cannot be a standard list of checkboxes that must be ticked when assessing the reaction of a victim during and after a sexual offence has been committed against him or her (_GBR v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 296</span> (“_GBR_”) at \[13\] and \[20\]). I am further reminded by the observations of the court in _Tan Pin Seng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 3 SLR(R) 494</span> at \[29\] that “_there is a natural reluctance on the part of victims of sexual offences to make a police report_” and that “_many of those who do eventually make a police report do so only after they have been persuaded to do so by their family or friends._” As highlighted above, the relationship in this case between the accused and the victim was emotionally nuanced and complex. Therefore, it would not be fair or realistic to fault the victim for not surfacing these allegations before, without fully appreciating and comprehending the complexity of the underlying relationship and the reasons for the victim’s hitherto reticence.

78     I believed and accepted that the victim had emotional and financial difficulties in deciding whether to leave the accused and his family, let alone taking the further drastic step of reporting the accused to the police. As stated above, I found that he held back because of the gratitude and respect he had for the accused. I also accepted his evidence that he had come to love and care for the accused’s parents as his own grandparents:

> \--they--they really treated me very well and very nice to me. I am closer and closer to--to Mr GCF’s father because we play badminton together and he really love to play badminton with me. And I will massage him, you know, whenever he has some muscle aches and muscle sore. My relationship with the mother also is-- I mean, she will--she—they--both of them literally treat me like their grandson. Yah, so that one, there is no doubt. I really treated them as well like my-- like my real grandparents and I really want to give them the best.[^25]

79     I fully comprehended and accepted the internal struggle that the victim felt in delaying his decision to finally leave the accused and to subsequently confront him about the sexual acts. I heeded the observations in _Chng Yew Chin v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 124</span> at \[38\] that:

> …a victim of molest ought not to be penalised or her credibility prejudiced merely because shame, discomfort or fear has prevented her from telling her story immediately or soon thereafter. Any reason that impedes such disclosure will always be a question of fact that can be explained or clarified plausibly by the temperament and/or character of a complainant. To suggest, as a general proposition, that a victim of molest must immediately report her situation even if it is to a mere acquaintance, is totally unrealistic and reflects a patent lack of appreciation for the plight and dilemma of victims of sexual abuse.

80     From the outside, the victim explained that no one suspected or would suspect that the accused was taking advantage of the victim sexually:

> QFor someone else who is looking at the two of you - let’s say, the accused’s parents or one of the family members - how---what would they see in terms of the interaction and the relationship between the two of you?

> AI think in 2007, the relationship is still okay. They won’t suspect anything from looking outside. They still think that we are---we are a---on a good guardian and ward relationship. That Mr GCF still take care of me very well, then I still paying back my respect and gratitude by helping them, yah.

### Victim’s Evidence is Corroborated

81     I agreed with the prosecution’s submission and found that the victim’s testimony regarding the allegations against the accused was further made more convincing and credible by the following corroborative evidence.

#### Articles on masturbation

82     The police seized printed articles on the subject of masturbation from the accused’s bedroom.[^26] The accused did not deny that the articles belonged to him and they were admitted in evidence. It is not disputed that these articles were printed in 2002. The discovery of these articles corroborated the victim’s testimony that the accused had shown them to him around 2004 to convince the victim that masturbation was normal and in fact good for health.

#### Letter of apology from victim to accused

83     The police also found a handwritten letter from the victim to the accused in the accused’s bedroom. This letter was admitted in evidence.[^27] It is not disputed that the victim wrote this letter addressed to the accused in late 2005 or 2006. In the letter, the victim apologised to the accused for fantasising about naked girls when they masturbated one another. The victim wrote:

> … Sometime when I am having fun with you, my mind was imagined of naked girl … I thought that you were also thinking of what I am thinking of, that made me thought that it is alright to think of that when masturbate…

84     The victim explained that he was apologising to the accused because the accused would make him feel guilty about fantasising about the opposite sex when they were masturbating each other. I found that the letter was contemporaneous and clearly supported the victim’s allegations that the accused and the victim had engaged in mutual masturbation.

#### Evidence of Victim’s Wife.

85     I found the evidence of the victim’s wife to be highly corroborative of the victim’s allegations. In fact, I distinctly recalled that when she took the stand to testify, she was indignantly staring at the accused who would look down and not dare meet her gaze. If I could read her thought bubble, it would have said ‘_how dare you sexually take advantage of my husband when he was young and now deny your wrongdoing._’ It was very obvious to me that the wife was telling the truth and that the accused was too ashamed and guilt ridden to even look her in the face. Essentially, the victim’s wife was indignant that the accused had committed these despicable acts on husband and yet have the gall to deny his guilt and play the ‘victim’ card.

86     The victim’s wife recounted how she met the victim on a group tour to Scandinavia in 2013. Because they were the only two young adults, they got on very well. However, she saw that the accused was unhappy that the victim and she were enjoying each other’s company.[^28] She recounted a specific incident during the trip when they were paired up to sing karaoke and everyone was having a good time but she saw that the accused’s glum expression was in stark contrast to everyone else. This aspect of her testimony was not challenged. After the tour, the victim and she remained in contact and started dating.

87     Her testimony as to how the victim first revealed to her the sexual acts with the accused was particularly poignant. She testified that she was the victim’s first girlfriend and they had their first kiss. She then teased him about his first kiss. He became silent and after a long pause, told her that was not his first kiss. When she pressed him, he then revealed what the accused did to the victim:

> “Yah, you know about my guardian. He actually did”---“when I was younger, he did kiss me and he asked me to do a lot of sexual acts on him.” And, naturally, I was very shocked.[^29]

88     This revelation occurred around August 2013. The victim’s wife advised him to move out of the accused’s flat and to make a police report. However, the victim was reluctant to do so. Eventually, the victim did move out of the accused’s flat to live with the wife’s family but he would not make a police report against the accused. From about 2014, the victim moved into the university hostel where he stayed until he graduated in 2015. The wife also testified that around 2015, after a chance encounter with the accused’s niece, the victim decided to confront the accused to seek closure. The wife suggested the option of an ‘out-of-court settlement’ and to ask the accused for $200,000.

89     I believed her evidence. It could not have been that the victim had lied to her right from the beginning when asked about his first kiss. I could see no reason or motive for him to lie to her about what the accused did. I also considered but found the other possibility, that the victim and his wife were colluding to frame the accused, to be unlikely. It would have been an unnecessarily elaborate and convoluted lie. There was also no reason why they had waited so long before framing the accused with false allegations. If the victim had wanted to make up false allegations to extort money from the accused, whether in collusion with his wife or otherwise, I would think that he could have thought of something else without also having to subject himself to potential embarrassment and inviting questions as to his own sexual orientation.

#### Corroboration from Accused’s Niece

90     The accused’s niece corroborated the victim’s account of events that led to him to decide to confront the accused. The niece confirmed that she had a chance meeting with the victim in August 2015 at KK Hospital when she was working there as a medical social worker. The victim asked why the victim moved out of the accused’s flat. It was obviously a sudden departure. The victim then revealed to her that the accused had sexually abused him. The niece advised the victim to consider making a police report. The niece did not appear to have doubted the accused at all.

91     In these circumstances, I found that the victim was telling the truth. The niece confirmed that it was a fortuitous meeting. It was not the case that the accused had arranged to meet the niece so as to make the allegations. If the victim had planned to frame the accused, I saw neither reason nor logic why he would choose to the accused’s niece as the first person who is related to the accused to make the allegations.

#### Audio Recording and Text Messages

92     The victim decided to confront the accused regarding the sexual acts committed by the accused with and against the victim,. The victim told a white lie that he had informed the victim’s parents what the accused had done. The victim first texted the accused on 3 November 2019 as follows:

> Hi Mr GCF, \[victim\] XXX here.

> After all these months, my parents still cannot forgive you for what you have done to me. They wanted me to proceed with legal ways to seek compensation.

> No doubt you have helped me before, but you also have leave a scar in my life. Yet I am trying my best not to take any legal action as I fear that other people’s life will be affected. But my parents want to seek justice and compensation.

> I do not wish to blow up this matter and hope that we can settle this amicably outside the court.[^30]

93     When the accused did not reply, the victim texted the accused the next day to say that he “_will report to police this week then_.” The accused then replied and asked the victim to call him. The victim called the accused on the phone that day on 4 November 2015. The phone conversation was recorded. Thereafter, the victim followed up the phone conversation with text messages with the accused. The phone conversation and exchange of text messages (collectively “communications”) are not in dispute and were admitted in evidence.[^31]

94     In their phone conversation on 4 November 2015, the accused first tried to avoid the subject by suggesting that they move on:

> Accused..Okay, with regard to what you say, I would rather that -- I thought everything was okay because I didn’t want to disturb you, I want you to move on, I also want to move on. The death of my father was – make me think, okay, let’s move on. So that’s why I didn’t disturb you at all.[^32]

95     The victim pressed on. It is obvious from the transcript that the accused knew what the victim was talking about. There was a complete and tacit understanding as to what the accused had allegedly done to the victim. The accused admitted that he had wronged the victim from the time the victim was in primary school:

>   
| 

Victim

 | 

\-- okay, I understand your position and I know that the family have helped me a lot, okay.

 |
| 

Accused

 | 

Yah.

 |
| 

Victim

 | 

And – but the fact is that mistake have been made. Okay, I also try to move on, okay.

 |
| 

Accused

 | 

Yah, I know –

 |
| 

Victim

 | 

You have done –

 |
| 

Accused

 | 

\--that’s what you say.

 |
| 

Victim

 | 

\--done something that is not right, right from the start, when I’m in primary school.

 |
| 

Accused

 | 

Okay, okay.[^33]

 |

  
  

96     Although not explicitly spelt out by the victim, it is obvious that the wrongful conduct was a very serious matter:

>   
| 

Victim

 | 

Okay, and I realised that, you know, what you have done is really (_sic_) long – very wrong, okay. They \[victim’s parents\] are very upset and they want me to know, you know --

 |
| 

Accused

 | 

Yah, I know what you mentioned.[^34]

97     It was so serious that the accused was prepared to consider making compensation to the victim. No clarification was necessary and none was sought by the accused. At the same time, the accused tugged at the victim’s emotional heartstrings to try to negotiate for a lower quantum:

> AccusedMy mother – aunty now is – she’s not well that’s why I’m also very worried about her, okay. I know whatever has happened so if you want to talk about compensation, you must tell me how much and I need to discuss with my family first, you see. I’m not sure, yah.[^35]

98     It is also apparent that the wrongful conduct was something that the accused’s family was unaware of and which the accused would not want his family members to find out and that he wanted to settle it quickly:

>

Victim

 | 

But the thing is that if you discussed with them, everyone will know about what you have done, you know.

 |
| 

Accused

 | 

No, no, no, it’s not discuss about – about something else but – no, it’s only with you only. If let’s say you ask for compensation, I can do that. But I also want to know how much because I can’t afford so much also, okay. So I need you to tell me, okay, so that we can settle this and we move on.[^36]

 |

  
  

99     It was also wrongful conduct that was serious enough to warrant lodging a police report and the victim expressed concern that the accused may do it to other boys:

>

But that is one – I mean, that is one of the reason why I didn’t go and seek police right from the start because I –

|

 | 

Yah, I appreciate it.

 |
|

 | 

Yes, okay. And after this almost 1 year, I reflected back, I realised that if I do not do that, you know, there is a chance that you may do it onto other boys.

 |
| 

Accused

 | 

No, I wouldn’t, I won’t do on other people, XXX.[^37]

100    The accused readily acknowledged his wrongdoing and said that he has “learned a lesson.”[^38] He also pleaded with the victim to reduce the amount of compensation. Otherwise, this matter would “_ruin \[his\] life_” and that it was “_the regret of \[his\] life._”[^39]

101    Having read and considered the transcript of the phone conversation, I had no difficulty finding that the phone conversation strongly suggested that the accused had committed the alleged sexual acts to the victim. He readily admitted to those acts and was pleading and negotiating with the victim for a settlement to save his skin. I found that the conversation could not have meant anything else and certainly did not refer to another subject-matter as contended by the defence i.e. caning. I will elaborate on this below.

102    Whilst the defence may well argue that the phone conversation did not specifically and explicitly mention any misconduct of a sexual nature, however, the victim’s subsequent text exchange with the accused left no doubt that they were talking about sexual abuse. Thus, when the victim and accused exchanged text messages following their phone conversation, the accused was, at the start, agreeable to compensate the victim to atone for the accused’s wrongdoing. The accused sought the victim’s “_understanding_” when the victim suggested a sum of $200,000. The accused did not express shock or clarify why the victim was asking for such a large sum of money. The victim then sent the following text to the accused which spelt out the sexual misconduct:

> He \[referring to victim’s parent\] do not want to speak to you also. He said you have sexually violated me for past 10 plus years from young age and if go to court, the amount will be higher.[^40]

103    As seen from the above text message, the victim made an express allegation that the accused had sexually violated the victim for more than 10 years. Yet, the accused did not even blink nor attempt to refute this accusation. Instead, he tacitly admitted to the allegation by simply pleading for the victim’s understanding. I found this to be conclusively corroborative of the accused’s guilt.

104    At the end of the day, I agreed with prosecution’s submission that the recorded phone conversation and the text exchanges, taken as a whole, constitute strong corroborative evidence that the accused had sexually violated the victim over the years when the victim lived with him.

### Victim Had No Motive to Lie

105    It is not enough for the accused to merely suggest, speculate or assert that the victim had a motive to falsely implicate him. He must adduce sufficient evidence of this motive so as to raise a reasonable doubt in the prosecution’s case. Only then would the burden of proof shift to the prosecution to prove that there was no such motive.[^41]

106    The defence contended that the victim had made up these allegations and that he had an ulterior motive to extort money from the accused so as to pay for his new condominium.[^42] I disagreed with the defence and found that the victim had no motive to lie. I found the defence suggestion to be entirely far-fetched and without merit. If it was indeed true, as contended by the defence, that the victim had a motive to extort money from the accused by threatening him with false allegations, then the minute the “cease and desist” letter was served on the victim, the victim would have realised that the accused was not yielding to the victim’s threats. If so, the victim would have backed off and not promptly lodged a police report unless the allegations are in fact true. If the allegations were fabricated, the victim would not have proceeded to lodge a police report risking embarrassment and jeopardising his career, and exposing himself to criminal prosecution for giving false information.

107    In the overall analysis, I was satisfied and I found that the victim did not have any motive to lie. I found that his request for compensation was not an extortion bid. The decision to confront the accused after so many years was, in part, encouraged by his wife but also stemmed from a desire to find closure to this dark period of his growing years. At the end of the day, I accepted that the victim was truthful when he gave his testimony. I did not find that he bore any grudges against the accused, at least nothing more than the accusations themselves.

108    On the contrary, the victim was in fact indebted to and felt a deep sense of gratitude to the accused and the accused’s family which prevented him back from exposing the accused for so long. I was satisfied that he had no reason, let alone motive, to lie or frame the accused for the sexual acts. It was abundantly clear from the tone and tenor of the victim during initial phone conversation that the victim was still very respectful to the accused and did not come across as someone who was vindinctive and an extortionist. Ultimately, he stood to gain nothing but in fact risked potential embarassment, shame and public scrutiny by going public with these allegations against the accused. These allegations, considered in the context of the totality of all the evidence, must be true and accurate.

109    I should also add that much evidence was led and much argument was made by both sides concerning the victim’s financial position to support their respective positions as to whether the victim had asked for compensation because he needed the money. The defence contended that the victim was paying off his student loan and had also purchased a condominium with his wife as their matrimonial home and therefore, he was in desperate need of money. On the other hand, the prosecution’s position (consistent with the victim’s testimony) was that both the victim and his wife were professionals and gainfully employed. Furthermore, the victim was a qualified medical doctor with a bright future and therefore adequately remunerated. As far as the condominium was concerned, the couple had already purchased the property having paid the requisite downpayment and secured a bank loan for the balance payment. They were also comfortably serving the monthly mortgage repayments.

110    I did not find that this question of the victim’s financial position was all that crucial or material either to the charges or in support of the accused’s defence. I was of the view that the evidence regarding the victim’s financial obligations was neither here nor there and certainly not conclusive of the parties’ respective positions. On a broad and objective analysis, I found that he was not in such a dire need for $200,000 that he would be desperate enough to risk everything in order to frame the accused with baseless and potentally difficult to prove allegations. On the other hand, there was also no denying that a windfall of $200,000 would benefit him financially. Either way, I considered the arguments to be at best neutral. As such, I did not see the necessity to dwell in great detail or length as regards the evidence tendered to prove the victim’s financial obigations and overall financial position.

### Acceptable Discrepancies

111    The defence pointed out apparent inconsistencies in the victim’s testimony. I was not so persuaded. I found that the so-called inconsistencies were either not inconsistencies, or were immaterial or otherwise did not affect the victim’s overall credibility when viewed against the totality of his evidence, and the abundant corroborative evidence. I have already addressed some of these apparent inconsistencies above.

112    Ultimately, I accept that any discrepancy or inconsistency in the victim’s evidence (or that of any of the prosecution witnesses) was immaterial and completely understandable given the passage of time and the number of incidents that had occurred.

113    The defence also tried to impugn the veracity of the victim in saying that the victim had lied about revealing to his (the victim’s) parents about the sexual acts. Whilst he may not have actually told his parents, I found that the victim said this merely as an excuse to contact and confront the accused over the sexual offences. When I heard the recorded phone conversation, it was apparent to me from the victim’s tone of voice that even after all these years, he remained respectful of the accused and also slightly awed by him. As such, the victim probably found it difficult to confront the accused outright with the allegations. Therefore, I found that the white lie that was told by the victim had not undermined his overall credibility and certainly did not detract from the truth of the victim’s testimony pertaining to the material allegations.

114    In summary, I considered the totality of the victim’s evidence as well as the totality of all the evidence that was presented by both the prosecution and defence, and found his evidence to be absolutely and unusually convincing and compelling. I found that the victim had testified to the best of his memory and in an objective and consistent manner. His evidence of the events and alleged sexual acts was, in its totality, both internally consistent and also externally consistent with his encounter with the accused’s niece as well as the text exchanges with the accused. I found the victim’s testimony of the sexual acts committed with and by the accused to be far more believable and consistent with the communications than with the accused’s denial of the acts.

### Accused’s Defence is Rejected

#### Accused Not Credible

115    I did not believe the accused having carefully observed his demeanour and having heard and considered his evidence. I was of the view that he tried too hard to paint the victim as an ungrateful ward and an opportunist. He further sought to ascribe unsubstantiated motives to the victim and the victim’s wife for making these allegations against him. In contrast, he portrayed himself as the selfless, kind, and magnanimous person who had offered to be the victim’s guardian and opened his home to the victim. There was, as I have found, much more than meets the eye. For a start, it was not disputed that the victim had to pay $300 every month to the accused’s family for staying with them even as a young student with no income. The accused was therefore not as generous as he would like the court to believe. I further found that the accused had an ulterior motive, which was to sexually groom and take advantage of the victim, when he decided to provide private tuition to the victim, become his guardian and welcome the victim into his home.

#### Accused Lied About Sleeping Arrangement

116    A crucial ingredient in the accused’s defence was that the victim was provided with and slept every night in his own room. Therefore, the defence contended that the victim had lied in his testimony that the sexual acts were committed when he slept with the accused in the latter’s bedroom. However, I found that it was the accused who had lied about the sleeping arrangements. It was pointed out by the prosecution which I accepted that the accused admitted as much in his statements to the police.[^43] These statements were admitted by the defence as a defence exhibit.[^44] As such, there was no question that the statements were voluntary statements and the defence cannot dispute the accuracy of these statements. In his statements, the accused said that initially the victim slept in a separate room. However, after a few weeks, the victim preferred to and slept with the accused’s in his (the accused’s) bedroom.[^45] This statement was consistent with the victim’s position that he kept his personal belongings in another room but slept in the accused’s room. This was also consistent with them sharing a room on all their holiday trips abroad regardless whether it was only the two of them or with the accused’s family members. I should also add that if the victim was lying about the sexual acts, it would have been easier for the victim to allege that the acts were committed in his (victim’s) room. It would not make any sense for the victim to not only lie about the offence but also to lie about sleeping with the accused. The victim ought to know that the added lie would have been completely unnecessary and easily exposed if indeed untrue. The same may be said of the offences committed in the school gym. It would have been much easier for the victim to allege that those offences were committed in the accused’s office (which he went every morning which fact was not in dispute) rather than in the gym to which he would not ordinarily have access.

117    When confronted with his own police statement (tendered by his counsel no less) regarding where the victim slept, the accused tried to explain what he was really saying in his statement. He said that what he meant was that the victim slept in the accused’s bedroom occasionally in the day and that he had his own room. I rejected his explanation. That is clearly not what was stated on a plain reading of the statement. Given that the accused is highly educated and has a good command of the English language, he would have had no difficulty expressing himself in his statement and would have phrased or amended it to accurately reflect what he had wanted to say. I found that he did state to the police that he in fact shared his bedroom with the victim every night.

#### Accused Lied About Articles on Masturbation

118    Even though he admitted that he had shown the articles on masturbation to the victim, I agreed with prosecution’s submission that he did not tell the truth as to why he did so. He claimed he was only trying to explain to the victim what masturbation meant because the victim was experiencing erections and was asking the accused about the experience. This explanation however contradicted his statement wherein he said that the victim had chanced upon the articles in his room and inquired about the articles. I found the victim’s evidence as to why the accused had shown him the articles to be more consistent and believable.[^46]

#### Accused’s Explanation About Caning the Victim Incredible

119    It was not in dispute that the victim contacted the accused (on the phone and through text messages) to ask for compensation for the wrongful acts that the accused had committed to the victim when he was a boy. It is clear from a plain reading of the transcript of the communications, particularly the phone conversation, that the accused readily acknowledged that he was sorry and regretted what he had done to the victim. However, the accused’s defence is that he thought the victim wanted compensation for having allegedly caned the victim on the palm when the victim was in primary school (“alleged caning”). In other words, the accused’s defence to the obvious admission is that he was referring to and was apologising for the alleged caning and not to any sexual act.

120    I agreed with prosecution’s submission that it was a ludicrous explanation and I had no difficulty rejecting his defence. As I have found above, the communications pertain to conduct of the accused that was (i) very serious, (ii) warrants lodging a police report, and had (iii) left a psychological scar on the victim, and which (iv) the accused’s family was completely unaware, and that (v) the accused’s life would be ruined if exposed, and therefore (vi) he wanted to quickly settle the matter without going to court and move on. There was no doubt in my mind that the accused was not and could not have been talking about an alleged caning. The phone conversation would not have made any sense otherwise.

121    If the conversation and communications were only about an alleged caning, one would have expected the accused to have scoffed at and rejected any demand for compensation. There would have been no question of a guardian having to pay compensation to a ward for a simple caning of the palm. I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that the absence of any shock, indignation or even surprise on the part of the accused was extremely telling and that the subject-matter of their conversation was much more serious, criminal and sinister.

122    The accused also made no attempt to clarify with the victim but immediately acknowledged his wrongdoing and was also prepared to negotiate the amount of compensation. I found that the accused was fully aware from the start that the victim was referring to the accused’s sexual misconduct.

123    I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that even if the alleged caning did take place when the victim was in Primary One, the victim would not have likely harboured such a long grudge over such a trivial event, and then feel entitled to demand for compensation after so many years. I also agreed that it would be even less likely or logical for the accused to believe that the victim was asking for compensation for an alleged caning on the palm that had happened so long ago. If the accused indeed believed that the victim was talking about the alleged caning, he would have at least tried to explain or justify the caning, or more realistically, reacted angrily at the shocking ungratefulness that the victim was displaying. The absence of either of these reactions was extremely telling that the issue of caning was not on his mind at all.

124    I further considered that any alleged caning was neither mentioned in the communications nor put to the victim. On the contrary, the text message sent by the victim to the accused on 5 November 2015 expressly and in no uncertain terms alleged that the accused had “sexually violated” the victim for 10 years. Even in the face of such a serious and explicit accusation, the accused did not express any surprise or shock and also did not deny the accusation.

#### Evidence of Defence Witnesses Unhelpful

125    The collective evidence of the three defence witnesses was essentially that the victim slept in his own room every night. However, I did not find their evidence to be helpful, conclusive or even supportive of the accused’s defence. Two of the witnesses (accused’s sister and her husband) do not live in the flat. Therefore, they would know that the victim was given a room (which was not in dispute) but would not be in any position to testify whether or not the victim slept with the accused at night. As far as they were concerned, the victim had a room but that did not address the real issue as to whether the victim slept with the accused at night. As for the accused’s mother’s evidence, I observed that she was very aged and senile. Therefore, I was of the view that her evidence was unreliable.

126    In any case, I accepted the victim’s testimony that from the outside, no one (including the accused’s family members) would have known or even begin to suspect that the accused was engaging in the sexual acts with the victim. In my judgment, the accused would have been crafty, manipulative and careful enough to cover his tracks and to keep up appearances so as to mask the fact that he was taking sexual advantage of the victim. It would not have been difficult for him, as the authoritative figure of the household, to hide what was really happening from his aged mother. His father has, of course, since passed on.

127    I also noted that after the victim had contacted him to ask for compensation, the accused discussed the matter with his family members. However, what was curious and very telling is the fact that the accused did not disclose to them the allegations of the sexual acts. In other words, his family members were left puzzled and wondering why the victim was asking the accused for compensation. Thus, the accused’s sister (DW3) testified that throughout their discussion with the accused in November 2015, she was unaware that the allegation against the accused was that of sexual violation of the victim. She found out what the allegations were only _after_ the accused was charged. Therefore, I found that the accused was not even honest and candid with his own family and had much to hide.

## Conclusion

128    Having considered all the evidence, I believed the victim and found his evidence to be unusually convincing and compelling. I found the victim to be truthful and that whatever minor discrepancies and white lies that were highlighted by the defence did not undermine the overall veracity of his testimony. I did not find that the discrepancies (either on its own or taken together) or white lies had rendered the accused’s conviction to be unsafe. I am satisfied that the victim did not and had no reason or motive to frame the accused.

129    I further found that the victim’s testimony was corroborated by the evidence of his wife and the accused’s niece and the communications with the accused.

130    On the contrary, I did not believe the accused’s denials and rejected his defence which was inconsistent with the totality of all the evidence, including material portions of his statements. The complete absence of shock and indignation when confronted by the victim after some years with allegations of misconduct against the victim was absolutely telling. His tacit admission of both his liability for and the seriousness of the wrongdoing coupled with his willingness to make compensation to the victim was totally corroborative of the victm’s allegations. The specific nature of the allegations was then revealed in the subsequent text messages which left no doubt as to the extent and nature of the allegations.

131    In the final analysis of all the evidence before me, I am satisfied that the victim’s evidence was so reliable that a conviction based on his evidence was _not_ unsafe. In conclusion, I found that the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. The accused was accordingly convicted of the charges.

## The Sentence

### Prescribed Punishment

132    In respect of the three charges of sexual exploitation of a young person which are punishable under s 7 CYPA, the prescribed punishment at the material date of the charges (2003-2004) is a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or both. The prescribed maximum imprisonment term has since 2011 been increased to 5 years_._

133    In respect of the rest of the charges of carnal intercourse against the order of nature, the prescribed punishment under s 377 PC (before its repeal) was imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and a liability to a fine.

### Prosecution’s Sentencing Submission

134    In his written address on sentence, the learned DPP sought a sentence of at least 15 months’ imprisonment each for the charges under s 7 CYPA and at least five years’ imprisonment each for the charges under s 377 PC.[^47] The prosecution further submitted that the sentences for two of the s 377 PC charges to be ordered to run consecutively making a total of at least 10 years’ imprisonment.

135    The prosecution cited and relied on a number of sentencing precedents in support of its submission. I propose to refer only to those precedents which I found to be most relevant.

136    For the charges under s 7 CYPA, the prosecution submitted that the sentencing benchmark for the said offence is set out in the _AQW v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 150</span> at \[50\] as follows:

> …a sentence of between six and eight months’ imprisonment would be appropriate where (a) the sexual act that took place between the offender and the minor involved touching of naked genitalia, regardless of whose genitalia it was, (b) the minor is 14 years old or above, and does not appear to be particularly vulnerable, (c) the offender did not coerce or pressure the minor into participating in the sexual act, and (d) there was no element of abuse of trust.

137    I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that on the evidence of the present case, an uplift must be added to the benchmark sentence to justify a sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment. This must be so since the accused has shown a complete lack of remorse by contesting the charges and then lodging an appeal to challenge his conviction. By claiming trial to the charges, the victim had to take the stand and reveal very intimate, painful and embarassing details of how he was sexually exploited. The accused cannot therefore be placed on the same sentencing footing as someone who admits his guilt and pleads guilty to his charges. The accused has forfeited any discount which would have been afforded him for a plea of guilt. I also found that the following aggravating factors (some which were highlighted by the prosecution) were present which justified the uplift.[^48]

> (a)     Repeated sexual exploitation of the victim;

> (b)     Grave abuse of trust and authority as Vice-Principal and tutor; and

> (c)     Some degree of premeditation.

138    The prosecution also referred to the following sentencing precedents where there was an element of abuse of trust and which I agreed were relevant for my consideration:[^49]

> (1)      _Ting Ting Hock v PP_ (MA 12/2016/01)

> The accused was convicted after trial on 7 charges under s 7 CYPA (before it was amended in 2011) for sexually exploiting his step-daughter. The offences spanned the period from 2005 to 2010, when the victim was 11 – 15 years old. The acts involved the rubbing of the victim’s vagina, and two of the charges also respectively included licking her vagina and licking her breasts. He was sentenced to **15 months’** imprisonment for each charge. Three of the imprisonment terms were ordered to run consecutively, resulting in a total sentence of 45 months’ imprisonment.

> (2)      _PP v Yeo Chang Yong_ (cited in _PP v AQW_)

> The offender was a 26-year-old teacher who taught a 14-year-old minor in her secondary school. Nothing untoward happened during the period in which the offender actually taught the minor. The following year, the minor added the offender as a friend on Facebook. Thereafter the offender tutored the minor privately over Skype. One day, he arranged to meet her for dinner. While walking in a park, the offender touched the minor’s breasts both over and under her blouse and brassiere. He was sentenced to **8 months’ imprisonment** for one charge under s 7 CYPA before it was amended.

> (3)      _PP v AUB_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 166</span>

> The accused was a 47 year-old male who had sexually exploited his biological daughter. He pleaded guilty to one charge under s 7 CYPA (post-2011 amendment), for touching and rubbing the then 13-year-old victim’s vagina. The sentence imposed was **1 year’s imprisonment**.

> He also pleaded guilty to another charge of digital penetration of her vagina under s 376(4)(b) PC when she was 12 years-old, and was sentenced to 12 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. One other charge under s 7 CYPA for touching the victim’s breasts was taken into consideration. The total sentence was 13 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.

> (4)      _PP v Low Chuan Wee Anthony_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGHC 258</span>

> The offender was an instructor of the martial arts club at the victim’s school. The victim was a member of the club. The offender initiated a relationship with the victim, and the acts were consensual. The victim was under 14 years of age when the offences occurred.

> The offender was convicted after trial of 7 charges i.e. 3 charges of statutory rape and 4 charges under s 7 CYPA. For the s 7 CYPA offences, he was sentenced, respectively, to **6 months’ imprisonment (hugging and kissing victim), 9 months’ imprisonment (hugging, kissing and caressing breasts of victim), and 12 months’ imprisonment (two counts for kissing and touching victim’s breasts and vulva).** The total sentence was 11 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.

139    As for the charges of carnal intercourse against the order of nature under s 377 PC, I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that the following aggravating factors were present:[^50]

> a.     Grave abuse of trust and authority as guardian;

> b.     Some degree of premeditation and sexual grooming;

> c.     Use of psychological pressure on and emotional blackmail against the victim to get him to agree to participate in or perform the sexual acts; and

> d.     Adverse impact and psychological harm suffered by the victim.

140    In light of the fact that the accused also contested these charges, the same considerations as set out earlier concerning the forfeiture of any sentencing discout also applied.

141    The prosecution also referred the court to the following sentencing precedents which I considered to be relevant to the present case:

> (1)      _Adam bin Darsin v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 1 SLR(R) 709</span>

> The offender pleaded guilty to 8 charges, all for fellatio performed on young boys between the ages of 12 and 15, over a period of 12 months. He had befriended one of the boys at the street soccer court, and came to know the other victims through this boy. 15 other similar charges were TIC-ed. The CA allowed the offender’s appeal against sentence, reducing the sentence for each s 377 charge from 10 years’ to 5 years’ imprisonment. The total sentence was 20 years’ imprisonment.

> (2)      _PP v Lim Beng Cheok_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] SGHC 54</span>

> The offender pleaded guilty to 5 charges under s 377 and 5 charges under s 377A of the Penal Code. Another 6 charges under s 377 and 40 charges under s 377A were TIC-ed. He also pleaded guilty to one charge under the Films Act.

> The offender was a tutor who gave tuition from his home. All the charges related to boys aged 13 to 15 years old, who were the offender’s students. For the five s 377 charges, some were instances where the offender performed fellatio on the victim, and some were instances where the victim performed fellatio on the offender.

> The sentence for each s 377 charge was 6 years’ imprisonment. Three of the s 377 sentences were ordered to run consecutively, resulting in a total sentence of 18 years’ imprisonment.

> (3)      _PP v AXR_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 257</span>

> The offender was convicted after trial on 6 charges – 2 counts of s 377 for making the victim perform fellatio on him, 1 count of s 7 CYPA for licking victim’s vagina, 1 count of outrage of modesty for rubbing victim’s vagina, 1 count of rape, and 1 count of digital sexual penetration of a minor.

> The offender was the victim’s uncle and father figure to her as her biological father had passed away. The offences occurred when she was 12 and 13 years old. For each s 377 charge, he was sentenced to 5 years’ imprisonment. For the s 7 CYPA charge, he was sentenced to 1 year’s imprisonment. The total sentence was 20 years’ imprisonment.

> (4)      _PP v AA_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGHC 10</span>

> The offender, aged 40 years, pleaded guilty to 4 charges under s 377. The offender knew the victims as their respective families had maintained a close relationship with each other. For the 1st and 2nd charges, he had the first and second victims, aged 11 and 12 respectively, perform fellatio on him. For the 3rd charge, he had anal intercourse with the third victim, aged 17 years, where the accused was the passive partner. For the 4th charge, he performed fellatio on the third victim. There were 12 other TIC charges.

> For the 1st and 2nd charges, 3 years’ imprisonment was imposed for each. For the 3rd and 4th charges, 9 months’ imprisonment was imposed for each. The total sentence was 3 years’ 9 months’ imprisonment. (Note: In this case, the third victim was above 16 years-old and was a fully consenting and active party. The sentences for the 3rd and 4th charge were thus on the low end.)

142    I further agreed with the prosecution’s submission that two of the imprisonment terms for the s 377 PC charges ought to run consecutively making a global sentence of at least 10 years’ imprisonment.[^51] I fully agreed that such aggregate sentence was warranted in light of the seriousness of the offences and the long period of sexual exploitation of the victim. I agreed that the single most appalling and aggravating feature in this case was that the accused had utterly breached, betrayed and exploited his position of authority and trust vis-à-vis the victim, being the VP of the victim’s school, his legal guardian and mentor, and a fatherly figure to the victim. A long period of sentence is necessary to give effect to the principles of deterrence and retribution.

### No Submission from Defence

143    Counsel for the defence did not make any submission on sentence or present any plea of mitigation on behalf of the accused. This was probably because the accused had already decided to appeal against his conviction. In any event, I did not find any significant mitigation factor that would have operated in favour of the accused. The fact that he was a first offender was not a material mitigating factor in light of the number, gravity and depravity of the offences.

### Sentence

144    I considered the prosecution’s sentencing submission which was valid and persuasive. On the other hand, the defence failed to provide any counterpoint to prosecution’s sentencing submission. I fully agreed with the individual and global sentences proposed by the prosecution which was appropriate, justified and commensurate with the gravity of the offences and overall culpability of the accused.

145    Given the facts and circumstances and the sentencing considerations as highlighted above, I sentenced the accused to a global term of 10 years’ imprisonment, which was neither excessive nor crushing.
