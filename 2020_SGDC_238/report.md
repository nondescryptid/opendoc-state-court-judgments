Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing

Penal Code – Offences – Causing grievous hurt

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9779/2020/01.\]

15 October 2020

### District Judge Christopher Goh Eng Chiang:

## Introduction

1       The accused was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment for one charge of causing grievous hurt under s 325 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (“PC”). The prosecution, being dissatisfied with the sentence I have imposed, has appealed against it.

## The Charge

2       The accused pleaded guilty to the following charge:

> “ …. are charged with that you, on the 5th day of September 2019, at or about 8 p.m., at Blk 75 Whampoa Drive #XXX, Singapore, did voluntarily cause grievous hurt to one Wong Yong, female 92 years, _to wit_, by forcefully pushing the said Wong Yong’s chest when you knew yourself to be likely to cause grievous hurt, causing the said Wong Yong to fall backwards onto the ground and hit her head on the wall, thereby causing her to sustain the following injuries:-

>> a.    A fracture of the C2 odontoid process;

>> b.    Fracture of the pelvis characterized by:

>>> i.    Mildly displaced fracture of the right superior pubic ramus;

>>> ii.    Mildly displaced comminuted fracture of the left superior pubic ramus extending into the left pubic body, and

>>> iii.   Comminuted fractures of right inferior pubic ramus;

>> c.    Fracture of the right acetabulum; and

>> d.    Fracture of the transverse process of L5 in the lumbar spine;

> and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 325 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Revised Edition).”

## The Statement of Facts

3       The accused admitted to Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification. A summary of the facts is set out below.

4       The accused is a 33-year-old Myanmese national. She was employed on 14 August 2019 to look after the victim, Wong Yong (“the victim” or “Mdm Wong”), who suffered from mild dementia. The accused was aware that the victim was suffering from mild dementia.

5       On 5 September 2019 at about 2000 hrs, the victim was pointing to the accused and talking to her. This escalated into a verbal dispute between the accused and the victim. The accused suddenly approached the victim and the victim pushed the accused lightly. The accused then lifted her right fist, threatening to hit her. The victim then retreated.

6       Knowing that she was likely to cause the victim grievous hurt, the accused pushed the victim on the chest with such force that the victim fell onto the floor and hit her head on the wall. The accused then walked away, subsequently returned and pulled the victim up from the ground by forcefully yanking the victim’s left arm.

7       Once in an upright sitting position, the accused continued to behave in a belligerent manner by grabbing the victim’s forearms and speaking close to her face. The victim struggled with the accused and grabbed the accused’s forearms. The victim also slapped the accused several times on the face while the accused pointed her finger at the victim and scolded her. These acts were captured by the CCTV camera.

8       The accused attempted to conceal the cause of the victim’s injuries by lying to the victim’s son, David Lim, on the phone that the victim had suffered a fall. When David Lim dropped by later that day, the accused continued to conceal the cause of the victim’s injuries. The victim was subsequently conveyed to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (“TTSH”) where it was revealed that, as a result of the accused’s actions, the victim suffered from the following injuries:

> (a)     a fracture of the C2 odontoid process;

> (b)     fracture of the pelvis characterized by:

>> (i)       mildly displaced fracture of the right superior pubic ramus;

>> (ii)       mildly displaced comminuted fracture of the left superior pubic ramus extending into the left pubic body, and

>> (iii)       comminuted fractures of right inferior pubic ramus;

> (c)     fracture of the right acetabulum; and

> (d)     fracture of the transverse process of L5 in the lumbar spine.

9       The victim was seen by orthopaedic surgeons who advised conservative management with pain relief and wheelchair mobilisation. As the victim was bedridden from the above injuries, she was sent to a nursing home on 9 October 2019. She remained bedridden until her demise on 2 January 2020 from unrelated causes.

10     When the cause of the victim’s injuries came to light through the CCTV footage, the accused continued to deny responsibility for the victim’s injuries to the police. Even after she finally admitted that she pushed the victim, she continued to maintain that she acted in self-defence to prevent the victim from assaulting her.

11     The accused herself was brought to TTSH by the police on 8 September 2019. She was diagnosed with the following injuries:

> (a)     scratch marks with yellowish-black bruise over the right arm;

> (b)     scratch marks over both distal forearms;

> (c)     bruise over the middle portion of her right thigh.

## Antecedents

12     The accused has no antecedents.

## Submissions on sentence

### Prosecution’s submissions

13     The prosecution submitted that the appropriate sentence was an imprisonment term of five years and six months. In determining this sentence, the prosecution relied on the case of _Public Prosecutor v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 19</span> (“_BDB_”) in which the Court of Appeal set out a two-step sentencing approach for offences under s 325 of the PC.

#### First step: seriousness of the injury caused

14     In _BDB_, while the Court of Appeal did not propose to set out a range of indicative starting points for each type of grievous hurt, it set out the indicative starting point of three years’ and six months’ imprisonment where the injury suffered were multiple fractures of the type and gravity suffered by the victim in _BDB._ In _BDB_, the victim, then a child of two years and five months suffered fractures to the left elbow, left calf and right eighth to tenth ribs. These injuries were caused by the victim’s mother.

15     In this case, the prosecution had assessed that the injuries suffered by Mdm Wong as being very much more severe than that suffered by the victim in _BDB._ Therefore, the prosecution submitted that the appropriate starting point was a sentence of five years’ imprisonment.

#### Second step: aggravating and mitigating factors

16     The prosecution highlighted two aggravating factors. These were:

> (a)     First, was that the acts of the accused were akin to “elder abuse”. Mdm Wong was a 92-year-old woman, a group of vulnerable persons that should be protected. She was also suffering from dementia. The accused was hired to take after the victim because of her vulnerabilities and the victim was fully dependent on the accused to take care of her.

> (b)     Second, the prosecution pointed out that the accused continued to behave in a belligerent manner towards the victim after the fall. She forcibly yanked the victim up by her left arm, grabbed her by her forearm and spoke close to her face. She also pointed to and scolded the victim.

17     The prosecution proposed an uplift of one years’ imprisonment from the indicative starting point of five years’ imprisonment to take into account these aggravating factors.

18     The court was also urged to put little weight on the accused’s plea of guilt. She was caught red-handed by the CCTV footage and, after she had been arrested, had refused to come clean despite being given multiple opportunities to do so. In addition, that she was acting in self-defence was not borne out by the CCTV footage.

19     Accordingly, the prosecution’s sentencing submission of five years’ and six months’ imprisonment was after they had calibrated for the aggravating and mitigating factors and factored in a six-month downward adjustment.

### Mitigation plea

20     It was a simple plea in mitigation from the accused. She was in person. She expressed her remorse for what happened and told the court that she had lost control of her emotions at that time. She also informed the court that the situation between the victim and herself was aggravated because they were unable to communicate with each other. The victim could not converse in English while she could not converse in dialect.

## Sentencing Considerations

### The punishment prescribed by law

21     The offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt under s 325 of the PC provides that “_Whoever …. voluntarily causes grievous hurt shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine or to caning_”

### The sentencing approach for a s 325 PC offence

22     As highlighted by the prosecution, the sentencing approach for a s 325 PC offence is set out in _BDB_. In _BDB_, the Court of Appeal set out the two-step process in the sentencing of s 325 PC offences at \[55\]:

> “(a)  First, because of the seriousness of the injury caused underscores the inherent mischief targeted by s 325, it is a good indicator of the gravity of the offence and can guide the court in determining the indicative starting point for sentencing.

> (b)    Second, after the indicative starting point has been identified, the sentencing judge should consider the necessary adjustments upwards or downwards based on an assessment of the offender’s culpability and presence of the relevant aggravating and/or mitigating factors.”

23     At \[56\], the Court of Appeal went on to state:

> “In our judgment, given the inherent mischief that underlies the offence under s 325, and considering that a more severe sentencing range is prescribed for this offence (compared to the offence of voluntarily causing simple hurt under s 323) precisely because grievous hurt has been caused, the factor that should guide the court’s determination of the indicative starting point for sentencing should be the seriousness of the hurt caused to the victim. As we have already noted, s 325 encompasses a broad spectrum of different forms of grievous hurt ranging from a simple fracture to death. We do not propose to set out a range of indicative starting points for each type of grievous hurt, but what is relevant for present purposes is that in a case where the grievous hurt takes the form of death (as in the case of the first charge against the Respondent), the indicative starting point should be a term of imprisonment of around eight years, which is close to the maximum imprisonment term of ten years; whereas in a case where the grievous hurt takes the form of multiple fractures of the type and gravity described in the sixth charge against the Respondent, the indicative starting point should be a term of imprisonment of around three years and six months. For the avoidance of doubt, we wish to make it clear that the indicative starting point might be higher or lower depending on the type and seriousness of the injuries caused. These indicative starting points may then be calibrated upwards or downwards in view of the relevant aggravating and/or mitigating factors.”

### First step: assessing the seriousness of the injury suffered

24     The Court of Appeal held in _BDB_ that where “_the grievous hurt takes the form of multiple fractures of the type and gravity described ……, the indicative starting point should be a term of imprisonment of around three years and six months_”.

25     In the present case, the prosecution had assessed that the injuries suffered by Mdm Wong were not only more serious than that suffered by the victim in _BDB_ but very much more so. The prosecution submitted that the appropriate starting point was an imprisonment term of five years’ imprisonment. This represented an 18-month uplift over that in _BDB_. The prosecution offered no reason(s) why this uplift was warranted other than saying that it was more serious than that in _BDB._

26     The victim in _BDB_ suffered fractures in three distinct and separate parts of the body, namely the left elbow (multiple fractures), left calf and ribs (multiple fractures). Mdm Wong suffered fractures in what appeared to be in four places. Of these, three fractures were located close together. These could be summarised as fractures of the pelvis (multiple), right acetabulum (a socket near the pelvis), transverse process of the L5 in the lumbar spine (ie. lower back, also near the pelvis) and a fracture of the C2 odontoid process.

27     In trying to determine which was the more serious of the two injuries, I first examined the type of fractures suffered. Other than noting that there were more instances of multiple fractures in _BDB_ (two) than in the present case (one), it was difficult to determine which was the more serious injury. However, I noted that the victim in _BDB_ had suffered _multiple_ fractures of the _ribs_. In my view, these fractures were clearly more dangerous and serious when compared to fractures, for example, to the pelvis as there was always a possibility that such a rib fracture, namely, a displaced fracture of a rib, may pierce a lung, especially where such a fracture occurs in a two and a half year old toddler. Taken in its entirety, I disagreed with the prosecution’s assessment that Mdm Wong’s injuries were more serious of the two. On the contrary, I was of the opinion that the fractures suffered by Mdm Wong, while serious in themselves, were not as serious as that suffered by the victim in _BDB._

28     I did not agree that the injuries caused by the accused warranted any uplift from the indicative starting sentence of three years’ and six month’s imprisonment set out by the Court of Appeal in _BDB._ I assessed that the injuries suffered were slightly less serious than that in _BDB._ Accordingly, I was of the view that a slight downward adjustment in the indicative starting sentence for the first stage was appropriate. I adjudged that the indicative starting sentence should be in the region of three years’ and three months’ imprisonment.

### Second step: aggravating and mitigating factors considered

29     Before considering the second step, it would be prudent to look at the video footage (without audio) captured by the CCTV camera installed in the Mdm Wong’s home. This showed what happened on the day in question. Although what was tendered to the court by the prosecution was one hours’ worth of video footage, of relevance was the first three minutes of this footage. The following are my observation(s).

#### Aggravating factors

30     The prosecution had highlighted two main aggravating factors that warranted a substantial uplift of one years’ imprisonment. First, was the victim’s vulnerability as an elderly person. The prosecution had characterized this as “elderly abuse”. Second, the prosecution highlighted that the accused was hired to take of the victim precisely because of her vulnerabilities, ie her dementia.

31     In _BDB_ at \[34\], the Court of Appeal held that,

> “The law recognises the special need to protect certain groups of vulnerable persons, such as the handicapped, the incapacitated, children and the elderly. An offender’s culpability will generally be viewed as enhanced where the victim is vulnerable. This is because the offender will, in such circumstances, be seen as exploiting or taking advantage of a relatively helpless person …….”

32     I agreed with the prosecution that the victim was an elderly person and would therefore fall within this category of vulnerable persons that should be protected. As such an uplift to the indicative starting sentence would be warranted. In determining the quantum of this uplift, I noted the Court of Appeal’s observations in _BDB_ at \[65\]:

> “ ….. The greater the advantage which the offender enjoys over the victim and exploits, the greater his culpability. Such advantage need not be only physical …. And such advantage may be given additional aggravating weight where the victim’s vulnerability is also rooted in the relationship of trust and dependence that exists between the victim and the offender”

33     In _BDB_, the accused had been the victim’s own mother. She was charged, among other charges, with causing grievous to the victim when he was just two years’ and five months’ old. Clearly the victim could be described as helpless and not being able to fend for himself. In the present case, although the Mdm Wong, as an elderly person, was in a class of vulnerable persons that required protection, she was not as helpless as the toddler victim in _BDB._ The accused was hired to look after Mdm Wong but her dependence on the accused was clearly not as significant as the victim in _BDB_. For the CCTV footage, we can see that Mdm Wong can be seen to be very mobile despite her advance years.

34     The prosecution had sought to characterize the acts of the accused as “elder abuse”. This characterization gave the impression that the accused had been “abusing” the victim over a prolonged period. This is clearly not so. The accused had only just been hired to look after Mdm Wong three weeks previously and, unlike in _BDB_, there was no evidence of prolonged abuse. If at all, any “abuse” by the accused, if it can even be described as “abuse”, occurred when she gave Mdm Wong a hard push and had started shouting at the victim when she had fallen on the floor. It was all over within 30 seconds (referenced time stamp: 01:13 to 01:42). On the other hand, in _BDB_ for example, the victim had suffered prolonged physical abuse by the mother and eventually died from head injuries caused by her in another grievous hurt offence when he was four years old.

35     The prosecution appeared to suggest that, as the accused was hired for the purpose of looking after the victim, there was thus a caregiver relationship between the accused and the victim. This was, therefore, an aggravating factor. It may be true that the accused was in a caregiver relation with the victim, however, in this case, I was of the view that it was not the aggravating factor that the prosecution makes it out to be. Whilst the accused may have been hired to look after the victim, unlike in the case of a toddler, as in _BDB_, there is no evidence to suggest that Mdm Wong was _totally_ dependent on the accused as suggested by the prosecution.

36     The accused had known that Mdm Wong was suffering from dementia when she was hired but, in my view, this did not necessarily increase her culpability. There is nothing to suggest that she had been trained specifically to look after the elderly, let alone one who suffered from dementia. It would be entirely different if the accused had specifically been trained for such a job yet, went on to commit such an offence of causing grievous hurt. It would appear that this incident happened was precisely due to the lack of training to handle or look after elderly patients with dementia.

37     The prosecution had put much stress on the accused’s “belligerent” conduct after administering the hard push that caused Mdm Wong to fall as an aggravating factor. She had forcibly yanked of the victim’s forearm and had proceeded to scold the victim after she had fallen. From the CCTV footage, I note that the accused had used some force in pulling the victim’s arm that this appeared to be done in some anger. it is open to debate whether this should be characterized as “belligerent”. We are unable to tell if this act was deliberately done in an attempt to cause more hurt and discomfort to the victim or, that the accused’s intention was to pull the victim up to a seating position, albeit in a rougher than normal manner as a consequence of her anger at the victim. In any event, this particular act of the accused did not contribute to any of the victim’s injuries. If there were, it was not brought to my attention.

38     The supposed “scolding” by the accused, hence her belligerence, after she pushed the victim is captured on the CCTV footage (time stamp 01:19 to 01:42). From the CCTV footage, to only say that the accused was “scolding” the victim is only to look at one side of the coin. Although there is no audio, the footage showed both the accused and Mdm Wong appearing to shout at each other. They are also seen grappling with each other with Mdm Wong slapping the accused thrice during the 23 seconds or so. The medical report of the accused showed that she had also suffered some minor injuries. These injuries appear to be consistent with the act of the accused and Mdm Wong grappling with each other.

39     For the above reasons, I was unable to agree with the prosecution’s characterization of the accused’s conduct as being “belligerent” and that these two acts after the accused had administered the hard push were aggravating factors that warranted an uplift in the indicative sentence.

40     Notwithstanding the above, I was nonetheless of the opinion that there should be an uplift to the indicative starting sentence. This uplift took into consideration the victim’s vulnerability as an elderly person. However, this uplift would not be not as substantial as the one years’ imprisonment submitted by the prosecution. In determining this uplift, I noted that in _BDB_, the Court of Appeal determined the uplift to be six months’ imprisonment despite the fact that facts in _BDB_ appeared more egregious than in the present case. In the present case, there was no exploitation of the victim and the relationship of trust and dependence that existed between the accused and Mdm Wong was lower than that in _BDB_. Hence, I adjudged that the uplift should be in the region of three months’ imprisonment.

#### Mitigating Factors

41     I will first address the accused’s culpability in relation to how and the manner in which the victim’s injuries were caused.

42     The accused had given Mdm Wong a single hard push. It appeared that Mdm Wong’s injuries were mostly caused by her hard landing on the floor as a consequence of this push. This landing caused the various pelvic fractures and the other fractures around that region. The injuries were not the direct result of the accused’s actions. In contrast, in BDB, the victim’s injuries were caused as a direct consequence of the accused’s actions. The fractures were caused when the accused pushed the victim and stepped on his ribs after he fell on the floor. She also twisted and pulled his hands. As mentioned, the factual matrix in BDB for the compared s 325 PC offence was clearly more egregious than the accused in this case.

43     The prosecution submitted that self-defence was not made out in the present case. I agreed. Nonetheless, based on my observation of the CCTV footage, I was of the view that the accused’s action is administering the hard push was contributed to some degree by provocation. From the beginning of the CCTV footage, we can see Mdm Wong continually scolding the accused who remained seated for the most part. She only stood up and confronted Mdm Wong when Mdm Wong approached her. She only administered the hard push after Mdm Wong had pushed her. As the accused told the court in mitigation, she had lost control of her emotions. I accepted her explanation.

44     The prosecution had urged the court to put very little weight on the accused’s admission of guilt. Despite being caught red handed by the CCTV, she continued to deny what had happened. Instead she gave two conflicting accounts: first, that the victim had fallen when she was trying to push the accused away; second, that she was acting in self-defence. Nonetheless, I noted that the accused had indicated her intention to plead guilty at the first pre-trial conference hearing (effectively the second “mention”), at a very early opportunity. She did not waste the court’s time. I therefore took this into consideration this as a relevant mitigating factor.

45     In determining the quantum of the downward adjustment of the indicative sentence after considering the relevant mitigating factors, I took guidance from the prosecution’s own submissions. Despite submitting that the court should put very little weight the accused’s relevant mitigating factors, the prosecution had suggested a six-month downward adjustment from the indicative sentence of six years’ imprisonment. This was a good starting point. Having considered her culpability and her remorse and putting some weight on these relevant mitigating factors, I was therefore of the view that a similar downward adjustment of six months’ imprisonment would be appropriate.

#### Precedent cases

46     In finalising the sentence, I reviewed the sentences imposed in several precedent cases involving the offence of committing grievous hurt in order to determine if there were any further adjustments that should be made to the final sentence. A summary of three of the cases is set out below.

47     The prosecution cited _Public Prosecutor v Than Nwe_ (DAC-905501-2020) (“_Than Nwe_”) in their sentencing submission to distinguish it from the present case. In _Than Nwe_, the accused, a foreign domestic worker, in the course of an argument with her 92-year-old elderly employer, began to scuffle with him, and she pushed him away with force. The victim fell backwards, hit his back and could not move. The victim suffered a transverse fracture at the L2 level of the lumbar spine which caused disruption to all three columns of the spine with retropulsion causing severe spinal stenosis. The victim underwent surgery and was warded in hospital for slightly more than two months before being transferred to St Andrew’s Community Hospital for another month. The victim continued to have difficulties in walking and required assistance to walk and move around. The prosecution in _Than Nwe_ submitted for a sentence of two years’ imprisonment under the first step in _BDB_ with no uplift for the second step even though the victim was also an elderly victim like in the present case. The accused was sentenced to 22 months’ imprisonment by the court.

48     I agreed with the prosecution that the injuries suffered by the victim in _Than Nwe_ were less serious than that suffered by Mdm Wong. However, I was not able to ascertain from the district judge’s notes of evidence in _Than Nwe_ whether he had agreed with the prosecution’s submission and that the entire sentence of 22 months’ imprisonment was attributable to the injury suffered with no uplift for the second step in the sentencing approach as set out in _BDB_.

49     Nonetheless, having reviewed both cases, the final sentence of three years’ imprisonment in the present case, representing a 14-month increase over that imposed in _Than New_, appears appropriate in the circumstances of the case.

50     In _Public Prosecutor v Tan Meng Teng_ (DAC-926248-2017) _(“Tan Meng Teng”_), the act of grievous hurt caused the death of the victim. The accused and the 71-year old victim had begun quarrelling while paying a game of mah-jong. They left the game to “talk things out”. As they were walking down the stairs, the victim pushed the accused down. The accused stumbled down the stairs. He then climbed back up the stairs and pulled the victim backwards. The victim fell back down five steps. The accused did not render any assistance after the victim had fallen. The victim suffered severe head injuries and passed away a week later due to pneumonia. The medical report stated that the head injury was severe enough to have caused the victim’s death.

51     The prosecution in _Tan Meng Teng_ also referred to the two-step sentencing process in _BDB._ It was submitted the indicative starting sentence for the first step was eight years’ imprisonment _per BDB._ With regard to the second step in the _BDB_ sentencing process, despite submitting that there were numerous aggravating factors, there appeared to be no submission on the appropriate uplift. Instead, the prosecution submitted for a sentence of two years’ imprisonment after considering the circumstances of the case. The court sentenced the accused to two years’ imprisonment.

52     In _Public Prosecutor v Soe Myint_ (DAC-911219-2019) (_“Soe Myint”)_, the accused was charged under s 325 of the PC even though the grievous hurt was committed with a weapon. The accused had agreed to act as a “bodyguard” to the co-accused in a dispute over money with the victim. The accused had heard a commotion in the room where the accused and the victim were in and went in. When the accused saw the victim on top of the co-accused who was on the ground, he took an iron pipe and hit the victim’s head several times. As the victim was lying on the ground, he hit the victim’s head with the iron pipe again. The victim suffered numerous injuries, including (i) multiple facial lacerations; (ii) multiple facial fractures; (iii) subluxation (ie dislocation) of the left lens; (iv) right temporal commotio retinae (ie trauma to the retina); (v) displaced fracture of the right acromion (ie shoulder blade); (vi) C3/C4/C5 cervical spine spinous process fractures; and (vii) right frontal extradural hematoma in the brain. The victim underwent surgery for his injuries and spent a total 27 days in hospital and had numerous follow up appointments.

53     Although the prosecution in _Soe Myint_ referred to the two-step sentencing process in _BDB_, the sentencing submission did not specify the indicative starting sentence in the first step nor the uplift, if any, in the second step. Instead, the prosecution submitted for a sentence of at least two years’ imprisonment. The court agreed with this submission and sentenced the accused to two years imprisonment.

54     Having looked at the cases above, I was of the view that the final sentence that I have reached was appropriate under the circumstances. There was no necessity to adjust the sentence any further.

## Conclusion

55     Therefore, having gone through the two-step sentencing process set out by the Court of Appeal in _BDB_, I was of the view that the seriousness of the injury suffered by the Mdm Wong was less that that suffered by the victim in _BDB_. Other than the fact that the accused was an elderly person, I found no other aggravating factors. Instead, I found compelling mitigating factors that, in my view, warranted a sentence was one that was lower than the sentence imposed in _BDB_. In summary, I reached this conclusion based on the following:

Accordingly, I adjudged that the appropriate sentence in this case was three years imprisonment. The accused had been in custody since 9 June 2020 as she was unable to raise bail. I accordingly further ordered that the sentence of three years’ imprisonment was to commence with effect from 9 June 2020.

56     The prosecution, being dissatisfied with the sentence I have imposed, has now appealed against it. The accused is presently serving sentence.

#### Postscript

57     This was a tragic case. The accused was hired to look after an elderly person who suffered from dementia. She does not appear to have been trained for this, either to look after the elderly or, more importantly, to look after one suffering from dementia. The accused and Mdm Wong were left alone in the home and their language differences meant that they were unable to communicate with each other, leading, in all probability, to the increase in frustration for both. All these factors were a sure recipe for disaster and led to the tragic outcome in this case. For both the accused and Mdm Wong.
