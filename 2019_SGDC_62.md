Contract – Contractual Terms – Interpretation of Contracts

7 April 2019

### District Judge Ronald Gwee:

## DCA 9/2019

The Plaintiff was employed as the Defendants’ Vice President Oil & Gas. He was also later employed, on a temporary basis, as the Defendants’ Managing Director.

2       Sometime in or around November 2016, the Defendants felt that there were grounds to commence investigations into the Plaintiff’s conduct. Citing “allegations of serious misconduct”, the Defendants served a letter dated 8 November 2016 on the Plaintiff (the “Suspension letter”). The Plaintiff was informed that he was “suspended from work until further notice pending investigation”.

3       After the investigations were carried out, the Defendants decided to terminate the Plaintiff’s employment. The Defendants informed the Plaintiff of their decision by serving a letter dated 30 November 2016 (the “Termination letter”). The Plaintiff’s employment was to terminate with effect from 1 January 2017; a further 2 months’ salary in lieu of full notice would also be payable.

4       As events unfolded, the Defendants, citing further “violation” on the Plaintiff’s part, saw the need to terminate the Plaintiff’s employment with immediate effect. This they did, by way of a letter sent by the Defendants’ solicitors to the Plaintiff’s solicitors dated 7 December 2016 (the “Dismissal letter”). The Defendants refused to pay any further salary or salary in lieu of notice.

5       The Plaintiff commenced this action shortly after. The Statement of Claim sets out the circumstances and terms of the Plaintiff’s employment as Vice President Oil & Gas, and temporary appointment as Managing Director. The Statement of Claim further sets out the circumstances surrounding the Suspension letter, the Termination letter and the Dismissal letter. The Plaintiff denied being liable for certain sums cited by the Defendants in the Termination letter (these sums form the basis of the Defendants’ Counterclaim, to which we shall return later) as having been allegedly wrongfully incurred by the Plaintiff. In the main, the Plaintiff challenged the asserted right of the Defendants to dismiss him with immediate effect via the Dismissal letter.

6       Citing the alleged breach on the part of the Defendants in dismissing him, the Plaintiff claimed sums representing his salary for the month of December 2016, salary in lieu of notice and leave pay for 3 days of annual leave not taken in 2016. For these items of claim, the Statement of Claim calculates the total to be in the sum of $84,032.25. In the Plaintiff’s Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief (“AEIC”) he states that his total claim added up to the sum of $85,645.16. The Statement of Claim remained unamended at trial and therefore the Plaintiff’s claims for the aforesaid heads were limited to the sum of $84,032.25, based on the calculation there. The Plaintiff also alleged in the Statement of Claim that he had suffered “further loss and damage as a result of the (Defendants’) breach” and claimed “(further) damages” for this. However, at trial, no evidence was led of any further such “loss and damage”. What was therefore left to be considered were the Plaintiff’s salary, notice and unused leave claims.

7       In their Defence and Counterclaim, the Defendants defended their asserted right to immediately terminate the Plaintiff’s employment by way of the Dismissal letter. The Defendants described the events that led to the Plaintiff’s dismissal, relying heavily on what I shall term as the “Communication Issue”, to which we shall return in detail. The Defendants also averred that they had, during the course of their investigations, “uncovered several expenses charged to the Defendants which did not have proper business purpose and/or not in general compliance with the Defendants’ Ethical Code of Conduct which the Plaintiff was not authorised to incur on behalf of the Defendants”. These, as stated in paragraph 5 above, formed the basis of the Defendants’ Counterclaim.

8       After hearing all the evidence and having considered the closing submissions of the parties, I dismissed the Plaintiff’s claim, save for his claim for salary for the period from the 1st to the 6th December 2016. As for the Counterclaim, I allowed most of the Defendants’ claims save for one particular claim, which was disallowed. The Plaintiff has appealed against my decision. The Defendants have not appealed against my allowing the Plaintiff’s claim for salary for the first 6 days of December 2016, and have not appealed against my disallowing part of their Counterclaim. I gave brief oral remarks when delivering the Verdict.

## The 3 letters at the heart of the dispute (Suspension letter, Termination letter, Dismissal letter)

9       The key to deciding the respective rights of the parties lies with a close scrutiny of these 3 letters and, where relevant, the events that occurred after each had been delivered.

## The Suspension letter

10     The Suspension letter was dated 8 November 2016 and delivered to the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff acknowledged receipt of the letter by appending his signature thereto. The Plaintiff claimed that although he “did not agree with the terms and conditions unilaterally imposed by the (Defendants)” in the Suspension letter, he simply acknowledged receipt of the same. However, the Plaintiff had not made known to the Defendants any objections he had to the contents of the Suspension letter. It would therefore be the reasonable expectation of the Defendants that the Plaintiff had acknowledged the Suspension letter and fully understood the contents thereof, and agreed to abide by them.

11     As stated above, the Suspension letter had informed the Plaintiff that he had been “suspended from work until further notice pending investigation into allegations of serious misconduct”. The Defendants reserved the right to take further action against the Plaintiff. During the period of suspension, salary would be paid as previously agreed. As the Plaintiff remained in the employ of the Defendants, he continued to be bound by the terms and conditions of employment.

12     The Plaintiff was required to co-operate with the Defendants in the investigations. The Plaintiff was not required to carry out duties and was not to attend at the workplace unless authorised. A further, crucial instruction was given: the Plaintiff “must not communicate with any of (the Defendants’) employees, contractors or customers unless authorised to do so”.

13     The Plaintiff was asked if he knew of “any documents, witnesses or information that (he thought would) be relevant to the matters under investigation”, and if so, he was to contact Mr Thor Orjan Holth. If the Plaintiff required access to the premises of the Defendants or computer network (from which he would not have access otherwise), he was to contact Mr Holth. The Plaintiff could also contact Mr Holth if he had queries concerning the terms of the suspension.

## The Termination letter

14     Following from the investigations, the Defendants decided to terminate the Plaintiff’s employment. The Plaintiff was informed of this by the Termination letter dated 30 November 2016. The employment would terminate with effect from 1 January 2017. Salary and allowances would be paid until the 31 December 2016, on the (higher) salary scale applicable as the temporary managing director. (The temporary position as the managing director was to expire in any event on 31 December 2016.) The Plaintiff would further receive 2 months’ salary (on the lower salary scale as Vice President Oil & Gas), in lieu of notice. These payments (salary for December 2016, and a further 2 months’ salary in lieu of notice) were in compliance with the terms of the Plaintiff’s original employment contract (contained in the Letter of Appointment dated 8 November 2013) which provided that the contract of employment could be terminated by either party, by the giving of 3 months’ notice or 3 months’ salary in lieu of notice.

15     The Plaintiff was further informed that investigations had revealed that there had been “several expenses charged to the (Defendants) which (did) not have a proper business purpose and which (the plaintiff was) not authorised to incur on behalf of the (Defendants). These were listed out as “(cost) of transportation (lease of the BMW)”, “(cost) of petrol and related expense”, “(business) trip to Italy”, “Formula 1 tickets”, “(payment) for (Plaintiff’s) wife’s trip to Oslo”, and “(payment made to OneBerry Lifestyle Pte Ltd”. Individual figures were ascribed to each of these expenses and a total sum of S$47,609 was cited. It is pertinent to note that this sum of $47,609 is actually the total of all the expenses _less_ the sum in relation to OneBerry Lifestyle Pte Ltd.

16     The Defendants went on to state that they “had not conducted a full review of all such expenses so the final amount might deviate from this”. All these discovered sums would be deducted from the salary to be paid to the Plaintiff unless he was able to “provide sufficient documentation by 5 December (2016) that they are rightfully incurred business expenses”. As it subsequently transpired, the Plaintiff was unable to provide such documentation.

17     The Plaintiff was reminded of the “obligation” imposed in the Suspension letter that he was not to “contact or communicate with any of (the Defendants’) employees, contractors or customers”.

18     The Defendants then stated, “We have been made aware of the fact that you have not complied with this instruction. Such non-compliant behaviour will not be tolerated by the Company and we reiterate your obligation in this regard. If you do not comply with the obligations imposed on you in the Letter of Suspension, the Company will have no alternative but to treat that as a violation by you of the Employment Contract and will exercise its rights to terminate your employment immediately, in which case you will cease to be entitled to any further payment of salary or salary in lieu of notice from the Company.”

19     This right to immediately terminate employment is found in clause 8.4 of the Letter of Appointment: “The Company, however, has the right to give immediate notice before terminating your services if you are guilty of misdemeanour, misconduct, negligence or breach of any of the terms of this Letter of Appointment.”

## The Dismissal letter

20     By letter dated 7 December 2016, sent by the Defendants’ solicitors to the Plaintiff’s solicitors, it was stated that the it had been brought to the Defendants’ attention that the Plaintiff had been contacting the Defendants’ employees, contractors and/or customers “without any authorization to do so.”

21     It was reiterated that pursuant to the obligation imposed by the Suspension letter and the Termination letter, the Plaintiff was not to contact or communicate the parties as stated. As the Plaintiff had “chosen not to comply with the said instruction”, the Plaintiff’s employment was terminated with immediate effect. The Plaintiff was thus not entitled to “any further payment of salary or salary in lieu of notice”. It was further stated that the Plaintiff was “also liable to repay… all unauthorized expenses… including but not limited to those specified in the (Termination letter).”

22     Finally, the Defendants demanded that the Plaintiff cease and desist from all further contact and/or communication with the Defendants’ contractors and clients.

23     The evidence showed that on 6 December 2016, (one day prior to the Dismissal letter), the Plaintiff’s solicitors had indeed emailed to one of the Defendants’ customers, on behalf of the Plaintiff, seeking a “meeting… to discuss… matters generally…”, and looked forward to a “prompt and favourable response” to the email.

24     Despite the aforesaid demand to “cease and desist” from communicating with the Defendants’ customers contained in the Dismissal letter dated 7 December 2016, the Plaintiffs’ solicitors sent a “chaser” email dated 13 December 2016, seeking a response. After the Defendants’ customer replied on 13 December 2016 enquiring as to the agenda for the requested meeting, the Plaintiff’s solicitors _again_ communicated, on 14 December 2016, explaining the agenda.

## Were the Defendants entitled to terminate the Plaintiff’s employment immediately?

25     The answer to this would have to be an unqualified “yes”. This raises the Communication Issue referred to in paragraph 7 above. This was central to the actions of the Defendants. The Defendants were relying on the Plaintiff having failed to comply with the instruction not to contact or communicate with the Defendants’ customers as the reason for terminating the Plaintiff with immediate effect. It is pertinent to note that, in the Statement of Claim, what the Plaintiff was claiming was that the Defendants were not entitled to impose this obligation in the first place.

26     In paragraph 13 of the Statement of Claim, it was averred that “The Defendant has thereby breached the Employment Agreement and the Supplementary Agreement (relating to the temporary appointment as managing director) because there is no purported obligation imposed on the Plaintiff either in the Employment Agreement or in the Supplementary Agreement that the Plaintiff shall not contact or communicate with any of the Defendant’s employees, contractors or customers, at all.”

27     It was further argued by the Plaintiff that the Defendants had sought to vary the contract between the parties by introducing this obligation as a fresh term, and as there was no consideration or insufficient consideration, this “term” could not be introduced into the contract and imposed as against the Plaintiff.

28     This argument could not stand. By the Suspension letter, the Defendants, as employers, had imposed this obligation as an instruction to the Plaintiff, as employee. Such an instruction was clearly reasonable in the circumstances, as the Defendants were about to carry out an investigation into the conduct of the Plaintiff. It would have been a practical and pragmatic measure for the Defendants to take, in ensuring that there be no communication between the Plaintiff and any of the Defendants’ customers, in order not to hamper such investigations. The Plaintiff had not made known any concerns with this imposed obligation, which had come by way of instruction. The obligation was not an onerous one, in any event.

29     The obligation was first imposed via the Suspension letter. The obligation was reiterated in the Termination letter, along with the intimation that the Defendants had been made aware that the Plaintiff had “not complied with this instruction”. It was this continued failure to obey a simple, reasonable instruction that would clearly have given the Defendants reason to view this as “misconduct”, hence entitling the Defendants to terminate the Plaintiff’s employment with immediate effect.

30     Just prior to the service of the Dismissal letter dated 7 December 2016, the Plaintiff would have been seeing out the notice period set out in the Termination letter. Based on my finding that the Defendants were entitled to immediately terminate the Plaintiff’s employment with effect from the Dismissal letter (that is, 7 December 2016), This would have meant that the Plaintiff was still entitled to his pro-rated salary for the period 1st to 6th December 2016. This was a point not apparently appreciated by the Defendants earlier.

31     As the Defendants were entitled to act as they did, the Plaintiff’s claim (save for salary payable for 1st to 6th December 2016) must fail. His claim for balance leave not taken for the year 2016 also failed, as there was no contractual right to payment for leave that had not been taken. There will therefore be judgment for the Plaintiff for only that part of his claim relating to salary (on the scale of managing director) for 1st to 6th December 2016, interest thereon at 5.33% per annum from date of Writ to date of Judgment. These sums will be set off against the portions of the Defendants’ Counterclaim which I allowed.

## The Defendants’ Counterclaim

32     There were several heads of claim in the Defendants’ Counterclaim. For ease of consideration, these could be conveniently banded into 5 distinct categories: the BMW motorcar, the trip to Italy, the Formula 1 tickets, the air tickets for the Plaintiff’s wife to Oslo, Norway, and the payment to OneBerry Lifestyle Pte Ltd. After a consideration of all the evidence and the closing submissions, I allowed the Defendants’ Counterclaim for the first 4 categories. The claim relating to OneBerry was dismissed. In summary (for those claims in the Counterclaim which I had allowed), the Defendants had proved, on a balance of probabilities, that the various expenses had not been properly and formally approved by the Defendants. These expenses had thus been wrongfully incurred by the Plaintiff. Further, in respect of the claims allowed, the Plaintiff had derived some measure of personal benefit.

## The BMW

33     It was clear that the remuneration package for the Plaintiff allowed for a transport allowance of $2,000 per month. The Plaintiff had proceeded to lease a BMW motorcar which expense well exceeded the said transport allowance. The Plaintiff claimed that he had obtained verbal agreement to lease the BMW. Yet the Plaintiff did not call this person (whom the Plaintiff said had verbally agreed to this arrangement) as a witness. The Plaintiff was unable to show any documentary evidence that such an added expense had indeed been formally permitted by the Defendants. By the Termination letter, the Plaintiff had been requested to “provide sufficient documentation” of these apparently unwarranted expenses (and for the other heads of expense as aforesaid). The Plaintiff was unable to do so.

34     After deducting the agreed monthly transport allowance of $2,000 per month, the leasing excess expense (for the material period) for the BMW amounted to $25,466. Added to this sum was the approximate sum of $1,200 for petrol and related expenses (which would normally fall to be considered under the transport allowance figure). There was a further sum of $1,070 for GPS and Bluetooth installed in the BMW for which the Plaintiff did not obtain prior formal approval.

35     The aforesaid sums in paragraph 34 above represented expenses that the Plaintiff should not have put the Defendants to, as they clearly exceeded the agreed monthly transport allowance sums. The Plaintiff had therefore obtained the personal enjoyment for items for which the Defendants ought not to have borne. I therefore allowed this portion of the Defendants’ Counterclaim. As the petrol and related expenses had been stated to be an approximate figure, I granted liberty to apply, should there be a need to revisit this claim to substitute it for an accurate sum.

## The trip to Italy

36     The Plaintiff claimed that this was a business trip which he had made at the request of a customer of the Defendants, Sembcorp Marine. The evidence at trial did not bear this out.

37     The evidence showed that Sembcorp Marine had not instructed nor requested the Plaintiff to make this trip. The Defendants had not done so either. This was therefore an unauthorised expense.

38     The evidence also suggested that part of the Plaintiff’s trip to Italy had likely been on a personal basis.

39     As the trip to Italy had not been authorised by the Defendants, and Sembcorp Marine had not formally instructed or requested the Plaintiff to make this trip, a similar conclusion could be made that the Plaintiff had derived some personal benefit at the expense of the Defendants, who had not authorised the trip in the first place.

40     This part of the Defendants’ Counterclaim, amounting to $11,353, was similarly allowed.

## The Formula 1 tickets

41     In his AEIC, the Plaintiff stated that 5 Formula 1 tickets were purchased after he had “an internal discussion meeting with … colleagues in the Defendant company”, and that such tickets were meant to be given to “valuable clients”. These “colleagues” were not called as witnesses.

42     In any event, the evidence at trial was clear that the Defendants did not condone such purchases for such uses, as such conduct would have run contrary to their code of ethics.

43     Of the 5 tickets, the Plaintiff had personally used one for himself and one for his wife, and one more had been given to the wife of a senior engineer in the Defendants. This, the Plaintiff stated was because there had been “no takers for the remaining tickets”. Clearly this had been a misuse of the tickets, as they would have been the property of the Defendants, and it was not for the Plaintiff to distribute these 3 tickets to the detriment of the Defendants. The Plaintiff (for himself and his wife) had therefore obtained a personal benefit at the expense of the Defendants, for tickets for which the Defendants would not have ordinarily purchased.

44     This part of the Defendants’ Counterclaim, amounting to $5,795, was similarly allowed.

## The air tickets for the Plaintiff’s wife to Oslo, Norway

45     The Plaintiff’s wife had accompanied the Plaintiff to Oslo on a business trip. The evidence showed that the Defendants had not authorised the expense for the Plaintiff’s wife to accompany him on this trip.

46     This represented yet another expense which the Plaintiff had put the Defendants to, which expense had not been authorised or permitted by the Defendants. Again, the Plaintiff had derived personal benefit (as his wife had travelled with him) at the expense of the Defendants.

47     This part of the Defendants’ Counterclaim, amounting to $3,915.20, was similarly allowed.

## The payment to OneBerry Lifestyle Pte Ltd

48     After considering the evidence, I disallowed this part of the Defendants’ Counterclaim. The sum claimed here was $18,900.

49     Whilst the evidence here suggested that the Plaintiff may not have exerted the best efforts in looking after the Defendants’ interests in this transaction, I found that the Plaintiff’s conduct had not crossed the threshold wherein he ought to be made personally liable for this expense. The evidence also did not suggest that the Plaintiff had derived any personal benefit from this transaction.

50     Therefore, I dismissed this part of the Defendants’ Counterclaim (which had been for a sum of $18,900). The Defendants did not appeal against this particular order.

## Conclusion

51     After a careful consideration of all the evidence and the respective submissions, I gave judgment accordingly as aforesaid.

52     With regard to the Plaintiff’s claims, all were dismissed save for that portion relating to his salary claim for the 1st to 6th December 2016, for which judgment was granted, with interest thereon. These sums were to be set off against the larger awards to the Defendants in their partially successful Counterclaim.

53     There would be judgment for the Defendants (on their Counterclaim) for the aforesaid sums of $25,466, $1,200 (subject to correction if such were necessary), $1,070, $11,353, $5,795 and $3,915.20. There will be interest on these sums at 5.33 % per annum from date of the Counterclaim to date of judgment.

54     I will hear parties further on the issue of costs.
