CRIMINAL LAW – Offences – Outrage of modesty

CRIMINAL PROCEDURE AND SENTENCING

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9005/2021/01.\]

6 April 2021

### District Judge Sarah Tan:

## Introduction / Background

1       The Accused is Foo Siew Tong, male, a few months shy of his 50th birthday at the time of the offence. He faced 1 charge, MAC-908033-2019 (the “Charge”), in respect of an offence under Section 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (the “Penal Code”). He was unrepresented.

2       The Charge stated as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="100%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">You, …, are charged that you, on 5 March 2018, at about 6.25pm, at the 12th floor lift lobby of [block where incident happened (“Block X”)], Singapore, did use criminal force to one [Victim], (Male / then 17 years old), <em>to wit</em>, by using your hand to touch his penis from the outside of his clothes, intending to outrage his modesty, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

## Facts

3       The Accused claimed trial. I convicted him on the Charge. I sentenced the Accused to 8 months’ imprisonment.

4       The Accused filed an appeal against the conviction and the sentence. A stay on the execution of the sentence has been granted and the Accused is out on bail pending appeal in the sum of $10,000.

## The parties’ cases: The Prosecution’s case

5       The Prosecution asserted that on 5 March 2018, at about 6 pm, the Accused had seen the Victim near the foot of Block X. The Victim, who enjoyed looking at aeroplanes fly past, was on his way to the 12th floor of Block X to look at aeroplanes flying past, and took the lift up.

6       The Accused loitered at the foot of Block X, then followed the Victim by taking the same lift up subsequently. At the 12th floor of Block X, the Accused used his hand to touch the Victim’s penis from the outside of his clothes, intending to outrage his modesty. The Accused also asked the Victim to show him what was beneath his pants, which the Victim declined.

7       The Prosecution called a total of 5 witnesses. They were:

> (a)     Sergeant Muhammad Isa Bin Md Rashid (“Sergeant Muhammad Isa”) (PW1);

> (b)     Inspector Chan Zhi Yao (“Inspector Chan”) (PW2);

> (c)     The Victim (PW3);

> (d)     The Victim’s mother (PW4); and

> (e)     Station Inspector Quek Han Xiong Darren (“SI Darren”) (PW5).

## The parties’ cases: The Defence’s case

8       The Accused’s defence was that he was a Good Samaritan, and was trying to prevent the Victim from committing suicide from the 12th floor of Block X. Any contact his hand made with the Victim was not intentional.

9       On 5 March 2018, the Accused did not go to work because he was feeling unwell. He was “feeling a great deal of pain because of \[his\] arm condition”. [^1] He was on his way home after buying dinner for his wife, when he encountered the Victim, [^2] near the foot of Block X.

10     The Victim appeared depressed and suicidal to him. He saw the Victim enter the lift of Block X and head up. The Accused asserted that he followed suit in a subsequent lift as he was concerned about the Victim.

11     The Accused saw the Victim at the 12th floor of Block X, near the parapet and on tiptoe. The Accused alleged that he himself was afraid of heights, so he beckoned the Victim to come towards him and away from the parapet. As the Victim approached, the Accused’s hand touched the Victim, although the Accused insisted that he did not know where. He subsequently tried to pull the Victim to safety near the wall. He then offered $5 to the Victim to go down to the sitting area near NTUC but the Victim declined. The Accused then left.

12     The Accused testified in his own defence and did not call any other witnesses.

13     For the sake of completeness, I noted that during Day 3 of the trial, the Accused alleged that he could not see the document before him clearly: During the Accused’s cross-examination, when he was shown his statement recorded on 6 March 2018, at 9.54 am (“Statement P7”), the Accused alleged that he could not see and identify his name and NRIC number very well, as he did not have his spectacles (which he complained did not sit well on his nose bridge) with him. [^3]

14     Nevertheless, the Accused confirmed that he could see better if the paper was held further from him, and he was able to hold the paper at an optimum distance for him to see clearly. [^4] As such, there could be no issues of the lack of visual acuity hampering the Accused from reading the material before him, and hampering him from keeping up with the proceedings. [^5]

15     The Accused had also complained about the police not having seized the Victim’s clothing.

16     Inspector Chan testified that the police did not seize the Victim’s clothing because it was contaminated, having “actually mixed with other clothings or surfaces”. [^6]

## Issues to be determined

17     The issues to be determined were:

> (a)     Was Statement P7 a reliable piece of evidence?

> (b)     Did the Accused touch the Victim at the Victim’s penis?

> (c)     Was there criminal force used?

> (d)     Did the Accused intend to outrage the Victim’s modesty?

## Issue 1: Was Statement P7 a reliable piece of evidence?

18     The Accused confirmed that there was no threat [^7], no inducement [^8] and no promise [^9] behind the making of Statement P7.

19     However, the Accused challenged Statement P7, on the grounds that:

> (a)     Some of the signatures were not or might not have been his.

> (b)     It was incomplete (not everything he had said had been recorded therein).

> (c)     It was inaccurate (it did not set out correctly what he had said).

> (d)     The room he was in was poorly ventilated/stuffy and noisy; his mind was a blank and he was not alert. [^10]

### The evidence of SI Darren

20     SI Darren was the recorder of the Statement P7. SI Darren testified on the statement-taking process.

21     SI Darren had first verified the Accused’s identity. The Accused chose to speak in Mandarin. SI Darren considered himself highly proficient in Mandarin, having obtained an “O-level pass” and using it “almost every day” to his family and colleagues. [^11]

22     SI Darren testified:

> “I moved on to question him about the facts of the case and he replied me according to my questions. Subsequently, I recorded the statement in a narrative format.” [^12]

23     SI Darren read over the statement of the Accused in Mandarin. [^13] and the Accused was given an opportunity to make amendments and alterations to the statement and the Accused did make some amendments and alterations in the statement and he was asked to sign by the side of the amendments he made. [^14]

24     At the end of the process, the Accused confirmed that his statement was given by him and he had no further amendments to the statement. SI Darren informed the Accused to sign on the statement at the end of the statement and SI Darren signed at the end of the statement as well. [^15]

### The signatures

25     The Accused alleged that **some of the signatures on Statement P7 were not or might not have been his**. He contended that he did not have the impression of these signatures being signed in that manner and he found them strange. [^16] To the contrary, SI Darren testified that the signatures in question were indeed signed by the Accused.

26     Firstly, I noted that, while on one hand the Accused alleged that some of the signatures were **not his**, on the other hand he appeared to suggest that these signatures were **his after all**, **just that they looked different** (from his usual) due to his location and/or his emotions:

>   
| 

“Q:

 | 

Mr Foo, I put it to you that all of the signatures I have gone through with you just now, these are your signatures. Agree or disagree? Mr Foo, this is a put question, you can agree or disagree.

 |
| 

A:

 | 

I think now I am not quite agree because some of the handwritings are **not mine**. Your signature---**your signature may be different when you’re at a different location**. In the normal circumstances, the signature would be like this…

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Under nor---**in normal times, the signature would be more neat and proper**. And---but people would have---**tend to have emotions** when he is emotional or when he is unhappy, **the signature will be I---I don’t know**. And when a person feels aggrieved, his emotions will be different.” [^17]

 |
| 

“Court:

 | 

Okay. So, those that you say were **not your \[signatures\]** that means **you didn’t take the pen and \[sign\] there**, not your hand, not by your hand. Correct? Yes or no? Correct or incorrect?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

I cannot confirm because **I do not have impression of signature being signed in this manner and I find it strange**. Therefore, I say could it be because I wasn’t being treated fairly, therefore **due to my emotions, I just signed like that**. It is **also possible**. I cannot be certain.

 |
| 

\[emphasis my own\]

 |

  
  

27     Further, I noted that there was no evidence that besides the Accused and SI Darren, there was a third person in the room or involved in the statement-taking process. The Accused did not go to the extent that another person had forged his signatures on Statement P7.

28     Insofar as the Accused may well be suggesting that SI Darren had forged his signatures on Statement P7, the Accused did not furnish any evidence to substantiate this.

29     As such, I found that the Accused, in raising issues over some of his signatures in Statement P7, was merely **attempting to dissociate himself from the statement** he had earlier given.

30     Subsequently, during the cross-examination of SI Darren, the Accused, **contrary to his earlier position, started to allege** that he was threatened. He also complained, inter alia, that ventilation at the remand location was poor and his brain was blank. [^18] SI Darren took the position that there was no threat, inducement or promise behind the making of Statement P7. [^19]

31     I found that, quite apart from the fact that these issues were brought up at a late stage (not during the Accused’s evidence-in-chief, but during the cross-examination of the rebuttal witness SI Darren), the Accused had also failed to substantiate these broad allegations. The Accused failed to effectively cross-examine SI Darren on these issues.

32     The Accused alleged that he had mentioned things that SI Darren had failed to write down [^20]: “I pulled him over to the wall and then the hand print, all these were also not stated inside.” [^21]

33     SI Darren maintained that he had written down all that the Accused had told him during the statement recording. [^22]

34     Ultimately, I noted that the statement was read over to the Accused in Mandarin and he was given the chance to make amendments and alterations (and indeed amendments and alterations were made). At the end of the statement-taking process, the Accused signed off on the statement:

>   
| 

“Witness”

 | 

These 2 are my signatures.

 |
| 

Interpreter:

 | 

Your Honour, witness is pointing at the 2 signatures on page 3, line 15.

 |
| 

\[DPP\]:

 | 

Alright. Thank you for the clarification. Your Honour with your leave, I will now take him to the rest of his signatures.” [^23]

 |
| 

“Q:

 | 

Okay, Mr Foo, please look at the bottom of the page 3 at line 15. There are 2 signatures there. Are these your signatures?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Correct.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

And there is one final signature, Mr Foo, and that is at the bottom of the line, “Statement was recorded in English and read over to me in, the word ‘ENG’ is cancelled out, followed by Mandarin.” There is a signature below that---below the cancelled out “ENG”, is that signature yours?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes.” [^24]

 |
| 

“A:

 | 

I did sign on the statement in these places.

 |
| 

Interpreter:

 | 

Your Hon---Your Honour, witness is referring to the signature on page 3, line 15, the 2 signatures there and then the last signature at the bottom of the page.” [^25]

 |
| 

“Q:

 | 

Just to clarify, Mr Foo, there are 3 signatures at the bottom of the page\[.\] 2 are on line 15. One is below the sentence, “Statement was recorded in English and read over to me in Mandarin.” 3 signatures. You signed the document at these three positions, correct?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes.” [^26]

 |

  
  

35     As such, I was satisfied that Statement P7 was recorded without any threat, inducement or promise, and was a complete and accurate record of what the Accused had told SI Darren during the statement-recording process.

## Issue 2: Did the Accused touch the Victim at the Victim’s penis?

### The photographs of the scene, the sketch plan and the CCTV footage

36     Inspector Chan had taken photographs [^27] of the 12th floor of Block X and the vicinity a few days before the trial.

37     Inspector Chan testified that “the parapet according to the photograph…the measuring tape in the photograph it would measure at about 1.23 metres tall”. [^28]

38     Inspector Chan had also prepared a sketch plan [^29] of the 12th floor of Block X, showing the layout of the units, the lift, and the staircase landing between the 12th floor and the 11th floor (the “Staircase Landing”).

39     In order to ascertain that the photographs accurately reflected the conditions at the time of the incident, the Victim’s mother was asked whether there had been any addition and alteration or renovation works to Block X, for example, works to the parapet or corridors. The Victim’s mother was able to confirm that since 2015, when they moved in to Block X, there were none at her level. [^30]

40     In any event, the Accused did not challenge the photographs and the sketch plan. As such, I was satisfied that they reflected the conditions of the corridor and the parapet as they then were at the time of the offence.

41     Inspector Chan had also obtained CCTV footage [^31] from the CCTV camera focusing on the lift lobby at the void deck of Block X.

42     The Accused also did not challenge the CCTV footage.

### The evidence of the Victim

43     The Victim testified that on 5 March 2018, at about 6 pm, he was walking towards the lift at the void deck of Block X and “saw that suspicious looking uncle watching \[him\]”, “staring at \[him\] out of nowhere…”. [^32] The Accused was a stranger [^33] and the Victim testified that he felt nervous because he was thinking of what the Accused was going to do to him as the Accused was staring at him. [^34]

44     The Victim then entered the lift and went to the 12th floor because he wanted to see the aeroplanes. He stood close to the railing, [^35] “facing the sky view”. [^36]

45     The Victim extended his head and a portion of his chest slightly over the parapet of the railing and he had his 2 hands clutched over the top of the parapet/railing. [^37] The railing was at about his chest area. [^38] He stood with his feet slightly apart. [^39] He could not remember if he were on tiptoe [^40], but he denied being on tiptoe when the Accused was at position D in the sketch plan. [^41]

46     The Accused subsequently came to the 12th floor also and he walked down the stairs from the 12th floor to the 11th floor. The Victim testified that the Accused stared as him as he walked down the stairs. [^42]

47     The Accused came back a few minutes later. He was standing at the Staircase Landing [^43], marked by the Victim as position B in Exhibit P3(17), equivalent to position G in the sketch plan.

48     There, the Accused took a $5 note and beckoned to the Victim, “Boy, come here, come here.”

49     The Victim moved to position C in the sketch plan as the Accused was beckoning to him. [^44] However, he felt scared and backed off to position A in P3(16), equivalent to position E in the sketch plan, where he was cornered by the Accused. [^45]

50     The Accused “touched \[his\] private part”, “at the penis area” [^46], for about 1 to 2 seconds. [^47]

51     The Accused then went to press for the lift. As the lift came up, the Accused asked the Victim to go inside the lift with him; the Victim refused and the Accused went down himself. [^48] Before the Accused asked the Victim to enter the lift with him, the Accused also asked the Victim to open his pants because he (the Accused) wanted to see what was inside the Victim’s pants. [^49]

52     The Victim denied that the Accused was trying to stop him from committing suicide. [^50]

53     The Victim’s mother testified that the Victim was diagnosed with autism at a young age. [^51] When questioned by the Prosecution as to where on the spectrum of autism the Victim lay, the Victim’s mother testified that the Victim was “functional” and “can have access to mainstream education” and had in fact been “transferred to a mainstream school”, though he sometimes still had “melt downs once in a while in school”. [^52]

54     That being said, I noted also that the Accused did not go to the extent of arguing that the Victim’s condition in any way affected, say, the cognition or sensory abilities of the Victim.

### The evidence of the Victim’s mother

55     I found that the evidence of the Victim’s mother was contemporaneous and corroborated the evidence of the Victim.

56     The Victim’s mother testified that shortly after the incident, the Victim had called and **sought comfort and help from her**. Upon the Victim’s mother rushing home, the Victim **demonstrated** to her what the Accused had done to him:

> “…He said, “I think, I’m molested.” So I said, “Okay”. So, being a very concrete and literal person, I asked him. “Do you know what is the meaning of molest?” So, I said, “Can you show me?” So, he stood up, he showed me, um, that a man has put his hand on his private part. Then he asked me, “Is this molest?” I said, “Yes. He touched you, right?” He said, “Yes”. [^53]

57     The Victim’s mother also testified that following the incident, the Victim **departed from his usual routine**, and brought his shoes in. The Victim’s mother had queried the Victim and he said, “I’m afraid the person knows where I live.” [^54]

58     The Accused argued that when the Victim’s mother kept asking him to demonstrate, it would “have affected his thoughts”. [^55]

59     The Victim’s Mother countered that she merely asked the Victim to demonstrate. She asked the Victim, “How did he touch you, like where he touch you?” [^56] The Victim’s Mother indicated that the Victim had no preconceived notion about what molest was but he felt that it was not right, “That’s why he called me back to ask me this question and hence, I asked him to show me what exactly happened.” [^57]

60     I was satisfied that the Victim’s Mother had asked the Victim general, “open-end questions” that **allowed for the Victim to answer the way he wanted to**.

### The evidence of Sergeant Muhammad Isa

61     Sergeant Muhammad Isa testified that on 5 March 2018, he was performing counter duty at the nearby Neighbourhood Police Post (“NPP”).

62     That day, the complainant, the Victim’s Mother, came to the NPP to lodge a police report, alleging that the Victim had been molested.

63     Sergeant Mohammad Isa recounted what the Victim had told him, which largely mirrored what the Victim had testified to in court. [^58]

### The evidence of the Accused

64     On the other hand, the Accused testified that he merely wanted to help the Victim. The Accused He testified that when he saw the Victim that afternoon near the foot of Block X, the Victim looked “depressed” and seemed like he “wanted to commit suicide”:

> “When he was standing there wanting to go, it seems like---it seems like he was thinking about something and it was—his head was lying low. It seems he has lost confidence, I---I—he seems to be like wanting to do something. **It seems like he was going to jump down**. I---I felt**. So, I was there when he went up and there was a round table, I was sitting there. I waited for a while**. **But he did not come down, so I went up**. And after I went up, I---I---when I came out, I directly went to the 11th and a half floor, **then I went down to the 11th floor and then I---then I went up 5 steps to take a look at what he was doing. I was standing there for quite some time.** And when he seem to be doing something dangerous, then I **shouted**. And I said, “Don’t’ do this, you come, you come, you come.” So, he came to the stairway, when he was standing at the stairway but when I wanted to go up to---to---to the 4th step in between at--- at the 11th and a half floor, and then he retreated back to---to the parapet and he was similarly doing some dangerous action. So, I stopped him again. I said that “It’s very dangerous. You must be careful.”. And then, “You will fell---you will fell down.” Because if---if somebody loses balance and if your legs are like that, then you will fall down. Then---because if there is such a rare opportunity, I definitely---so I asked him to come over. Then---**then I grabbed him**. And once I grabbed him, I **pulled him back to the wall behind me** and then I was standing there and he was standing---he was standing at somewhere safe and then I asked him---and then he suddenly work up, it seems like, and---and then he---he seemed to be a bit shocked be---because I---I was afraid it will be very dangerous for him. I was afraid that he would want to go back to that place again.” [^59] \[emphasis my own\]

65     The Accused said that he offered the Victim $5 to go downstairs:

> “So, I---I---I took out $5, I said, “If not the round table also can---but round table also---downstairs, also can.” I saw---I—I saw his hand wanting to come and grab my money, so I---so I moved my hand back…But in the end, he did not go down with me. And when I saw the he was already awake and---and he seemed okay, so I went---I went home myself. I went down…” [^60]

#### Accused’s conclusion that Victim was “depressed” and “suicidal”

66     It was clear that the Accused’s **encounter** with the Victim **near the foot of Block X was brief**.

67     The CCTV footage, from 18:15:17 to 18:15:30, showed the Victim at the car park area walking towards the lift at the void deck of Block X. The Accused was captured in the video at the same time.

68     This conclusion about the Victim being “depressed” and “suicidal” was formed by the Accused **merely from the Victim’s facial expression alone**, which the Accused **barely observed for a few minutes**. [^61]

69     Despite being unwell and still being in pain, and having food on his hands to deliver home to his wife, the Accused decided to **follow the Victim merely on the basis of his observations of the Victim’s facial expressions**.

70     I found it hard to believe that with just a brief encounter between strangers, the Accused could already conclude that the Victim was “depressed” and “suicidal”.

71     What I found more incredible was that, based on the brief encounter, the Accused was also able to tell that the Victim was going to commit suicide **by, in particular, “jumping down”**:

> “When he was standing there wanting to go, it seems like---it seems like he was thinking about something and it was—his head was lying low. It seems he has lost confidence, I---I—he seems to be like wanting to do something. **It seems like he was going to jump down**. I---I felt**.” [^62]**

#### Accused waited at void deck after the Victim had taken lift up

72     The Accused had seen the Victim take the lift, and the lift stopped at the 12th floor, based on the LCD floor number display. Yet, contrary to his alleged **concerns over the Victim’s suicide risk**, the Accused **did not follow immediately**:

> “…So, I was there when he went up and there was a round table, **I was sitting there. I waited for a while**…” [^63]

73     If the Accused had **genuine concerns about the suicide risk** of the Victim, then **time** would have been **of the essence** and he **would not have loitered near the void deck** of block X:

>   
| 

“DPP:

 | 

Mr Foo, is it your evidence that after you saw the victim go the 12th floor, you were **concerned that the victim was going to commit suicide**?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

DPP:

 | 

It is your evidence that you **waited at the void deck for a few minutes** and when the victim did not come back down---

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

DPP:

 | 

you got worried?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes.” [^64]

 |

  
  

74     More fundamentally, this assertion by the Accused **that he waited** for a few minutes **was not even true in the first place**. The Accused said he waited about 5 to 10 minutes before heading up in the same lift. [^65] But the CCTV footage showed that immediately after the lift was shown to have stopped at the 12th floor, the Accused went forward to press the lift button. [^66]

75     As such, I did not find it convincing that the Accused had been motivated by a desire to help the Victim who was allegedly “depressed” and “suicidal”.

#### 12th floor lift lobby to position F in the sketch plan to position G in the sketch plan

76     The Accused testified that when he first saw the Victim at the 12th floor, the Victim was at the parapet at position E in the sketch plan, which corresponded with the pictures at Exhibit P3(6) (with Victim’s marking of his position with “A”), Exhibit P3(7) and Exhibit P3(10).

77     The Victim was 1.6 m tall. [^67] The parapet, including the railing, was about 1.23 m in height. [^68]

78     These were not challenged by the Accused.

79     At the 12th floor, he saw that the Victim’s “facial expression \[was\] very bad” [^69] and the Victim gave him the feeling that “he did not want to live anymore”. [^70]

80     The Accused pointed to the fact that the Victim was “standing at the parapet and when the wind came…standing there and staring. He wasn’t looking at the sky. He…was bending his body and looking down and then when the wind blew, he was waving his hands” [^71].

81     Yet, despite the risks and dangers perceived by the Accused, the Accused’s **actions were furtive**.

82     From the 12th floor, the Accused **made his way to the 11th floor**. The Accused testified that after he made his way to the 11th floor, he made his way **up the flight of steps (4 steps) to position F** in the sketch plan. [^72]

83     Position F was on the flight of steps that led from the Staircase Landing, to the 11th floor. Thus, **this position F was lower** than the Staircase Landing itself, or any point on the flight of steps between the Staircase Landing and the 12th floor.

84     Further, I observed from Exhibits P3(16) and P3(17) that there was a grille at the 12th floor roughly above position F. Someone **standing at position F**, looking at the Victim standing at or near position E in the sketch plan, would **have had to look through these grilles**, **assuming his elevation and angle were even right**.

85     Even assuming the Accused indeed had a fear of heights, I would have expected that **standing somewhere else**, say, at the Staircase Landing itself at position G in the sketch plan, would have offered the Accused **a better vantage point, to be able to render timely assistance to the Victim**.

86     By stationing himself at position F in the sketch plan, 4 steps from the 11th floor, it did not appear to me plausible that the Accused had **genuine concerns about the suicide risk of the Victim**, and that he **meant to keep an eye on the Victim**,

#### Standing at the Staircase Landing

87     The Accused testified that when at position F, he saw the Victim doing something dangerous, and shouted at the Victim, and walked from position F to the Staircase Landing, to position G in the sketch plan. [^73]

88     Given the Accused’s position that he was **concerned about the Victim and the sense of danger and urgency, it seemed peculiar that the Accused merely remained at position G**.

89     While I noted the Accused’s alleged fear of heights, I noted that he was **able to overcome his fear of heights after all**, when he subsequently was able to, by his own evidence, get onto the 12th floor itself, and pull the Victim away from the parapet to the wall.

90     As such, I found it peculiar that **despite the Accused perceiving danger and urgency on this occasion (that warranted him shouting out to the Victim)**, he did not get onto the 12th floor and do more, but **merely stood at the Staircase Landing** at position G in the sketch plan.

#### The 2 occasions of bodily contact with the Victim

91     The Accused testified that there were only 2 times when there was bodily contact with the Victim:

> (a)     First, when the Accused was in position D on the sketch plan [^74], he asked the Victim to walk towards him and he extended his arm and the Victim accidentally walked into his outstretched hand (“1st Touch”). [^75]

> (b)     Second, when the Accused grabbed the Victim and pulled him away from the parapet and towards the wall (“2nd Touch”). [^76]

#### The 1st Touch

92     The Accused first gave his account of what happened at the 12th floor of Block X during the cross-examination of the 1st Prosecution Witness Sergeant Muhammad Isa. The Accused stated:

> “When---when he came near me and---and I actually **stretched out my hand**, asking him to come nearer because he was still very far away from me and when he came nearer and I---when **he came nearer until my hand touched him, I did not know where I touched him**, I quickly withdraw with---I quickly withdraw my hand.“ [^77] \[emphasis my own\]

93     During the cross-examination of the Victim’s mother, the Accused reiterated:

> “So, **I stretched out my hand**, I asked him---I asked him to come over and **I stretched out my hand** but once---so, he walked towards me and **was stretching out my hand and when he came over**, my---**my hand touched him and then I quickly retract---retracted my hand** and---and then I grabbed him back towards the---the wall.” [^78]

94     In his examination-in-chief, the Accused testified that he had stretched out his arm, palm upwards, palm level at the height of Accused’s stomach/waist, at an angle of 45 degrees. [^79] The Victim **walked into his hand**. [^80] The Accused testified that he **did not know where the contact point was**. [^81]

95     In cross-examination, the Accused conceded that he **had touched the Victim accidentally, but he did not know which part he touched.**[^82] The Accused also elaborated that due to his **fear of heights, his leg felt soft** and **the right side of his body moved downwards**, and **the Victim accidentally walked into his hand. [^83]**

96      **Yet**, I noted that in **Statement P7**, the Accused has **admitted** to contacting with the Victim’s groin: “My right had **accidentally** brushed against his **groin** area, and my body brushed against his body”.

97     Further, there was **no mention** of his leg feeling soft and the right side of his body moving downwards in Statement P7.

#### The 2nd Touch

98     The Accused reiterated that when he was at position D, he finally pulled the Victim towards the wall to safety.

99     Yet, in **Statement P7**, there was **no mention** of the Accused pulling the Victim from the parapet to the wall.

100    The Victim denied that the Accused had pulled him and he also denied placing his hands on the wall. [^84]

#### Leaving the Victim

101    The Accused testified that he offered the Victim money, intending for him to go and sit at the sitting area near NTUC where there were a lot of people to look after him, but he acknowledged that those people would be **strangers** to the victim. [^85]

102    I found it implausible that the Accused, if genuinely concerned about the Victim, would entrust the care of the allegedly depressed and suicidal Victim to strangers, the elderly and foreigners. The Accused also did not approach the residents of #XXX and #XXX for help, despite their windows being open. [^86] The Accused also did not call the police then or offer to help the Victim call his family members. [^87]**When the supposedly depressed suicidal Victim refused to follow him downstairs, the Accused then simply left.**

#### Not approaching the Victim’s mother

103    The Accused met the Victim and the Victim’s Mother that night. If the Accused had **genuine concerns about the suicide risk of the Victim**, that would have been a good opportunity to engage an adult known to the Victim. The Accused did not think to talk to the Victim’s Mother.

## Issue 3: Was the Victim’s evidence “unusually convincing”?

104    There were no other immediate eyewitnesses to the incident besides the Victim and the Accused.

105    Where there were only the Victim and the Accused present at the incident, this was a case of one person’s word against another. In _XP v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 686</span> at \[27\]:

> “…\[the Victim’s\] testimony must be unusually convincing in order to prove the Prosecution’s case beyond reasonable doubt without independent corroboration...” [^88]

106    The term “unusually convincing” was explained by the Court of Appeal in _Public Prosecutor v Mohammed Liton Muhammed Syeed Mallik_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 601</span> at \[39\]:

> “... In our view, therefore, the “extra something” implied by the word “unusually” must refer to the need for the trial judge to be aware of the dangers of convicting solely on the complainant’s testimony as well as of the importance of convicting only on testimony that, when weighted against the overall backdrop of the available facts and circumstances, contains that ring of truth which leaves the court satisfied that no reasonable doubt exists in favour of the accused.” [^89]

107    Upon consideration of all the evidence, I found that the evidence of the Victim was unusually convincing.

108    The Victim’s testimony was internally consistent. He did not contradict himself. His unease and fear after the incident also manifested in his unusual behaviour (taking his shoes in) and in his interactions with the Victim’s mother (calling for help).

109    The Victim’s testimony was externally consistent. The CCTV footage showed that after the Victim exited the lift after the incident, he was tentative and hesitant, hinting at the caution he was taking given his recent encounter with the Accused, who had left the 12th floor via the same lift.

110    The Victim’s testimony in court, some 2 years after the incident, was also consistent with what he had shared with the Victim’s mother and Sergeant Muhammad Isa in the aftermath of the incident.

111    On the other hand, the Accused’s characterisation of himself as a Good Samaritan was not convincing. He purported to be able to tell that the Victim was depressed and suicidal from a brief encounter. His actions at the 12th floor of Block X were also furtive and not consistent with someone who genuinely meant to save a depressed and suicidal person from harm.

112    The Accused’s testimony in court was also inconsistent with his Statement P7, which he first attempted to dissociate himself from. The Accused was not a credible witness.

## Issue 4: Was the Charge made out?

113    “Criminal force” is defined at Section 350 of the Penal Code as follows:

> “Whoever **intentionally** uses **force** to any person, **without** that person’s **consent**, in order to cause the committing of any offence, or intending by the use of such force illegally to cause, or knowing it to be likely that by the use of such force he will illegally cause injury, fear or annoyance to the person to whom the force is used, is said to use criminal force to that other.” \[emphasis my own\]

114    I was satisfied that **the Accused had touched the Victim’s penis from the outside of his clothes, and the Accused had done so intentionally**. As such, **force was used intentionally**. I was also satisfied that this was done **without the Victim’s consent**.

115    I was satisfied that the Accused **intended to outrage** the Victim’s modesty. This was evident from the calculated steps and premeditation exhibited by the Accused in trailing the Victim from the void deck of Block X to the 12th floor, and his furtive actions thereat.

116    Based on the evidence adduced in the course of this trial, I am satisfied that the Prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused had indeed on 5 March 2018, at about 6.25 pm, at the 12th floor lift lobby of Block X used criminal force to the Victim, _to wit_, by using his hand to touch the Victim’s penis from the outside of his clothes, intending to outrage his modesty.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed penalties

117    The prescribed punishment for an offence under Section 354(1) of the Penal Code would be imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with caning, or with a combination of such punishments.

118    Section 325(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code provided as follows:

> “The following persons shall not be punished with caning:

>> …

>> (b)    men who are more than 50 years of age at the time of infliction of the caning…”

119    The Accused could not be sentenced to any caning, as he was already more than 50 years of age at the time the trial started, and certainly by the time he was sentenced.

### Antecedents

120    The Accused did not have any criminal record.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

#### The Kunesekaran framework

121    The Prosecution sought a sentence of at least 10 month’s imprisonment.

122    The Prosecution relied on the sentencing framework set out in **_Kunesekaran s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v Public Prosecutor_** <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 9</span> (“Kunesekaran”).

123    The Prosecution submitted that the first step of the framework required the Court to consider the following offence-specific factors [^90]:

> (a)     The degree of sexual exploitation: “This includes considerations of the part of the victim's body the accused touched, how the accused touched the victim, and the duration of the outrage of modesty”.

> (b)     The circumstances of the offence: “These include considerations of: (A) the presence of premeditation; (B) the use of force or violence; (C) the abuse of a position of trust; (D) the use of deception; (E) the presence of other aggravating acts accompanying the outrage of modesty; and (F) the exploitation of a vulnerable victim”.

> (c)     The harm caused to the victim: “whether physical or psychological, which would usually be set out in a victim impact statement”.

124    Considering the various offence-specific factors, the Court should then place the offence within any of the following 3 bands:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="14.2228445689138%"> <col width="62.0124024804961%"> <col width="23.7647529505901%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Band 1</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">This includes cases that do not present any, or at most one,</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">of the offence-specific factors, and typically involves cases</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">that involve a fleeting touch or no skin-to-skin contact, and</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">no intrusion into the victim's private parts.</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Less than five</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">months'</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Band 2</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">This includes cases where two or more of the offence specific</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">factors present themselves.

125    The Prosecution submitted that the second step of the framework required the Court to consider offender-specific aggravating and mitigating factors. Aggravating factors include the number of charges taken into consideration, the lack of remorse, and relevant antecedents demonstrating recalcitrance. Mitigating factors include a timeous plea of guilt or the presence of a mental disorder or intellectual disability on the part of the accused that relates to the offence.

126    In particular, the Prosecution argued that the present case fell within Band 2 of the Kunesekaran framework because of 2 offence specific aggravating factors present.

127    Firstly, the degree of sexual exploitation was considerable. Although there was no skin-to-skin contact, the Accused intruded upon the Victim’s private parts by touching the Victim’s penis over the Victim’s pants.

128    Secondly, the circumstances of the offence demonstrated clear premeditation. The Accused stalked the Victim from the void deck of Block X to the 12th floor of Block X. He observed the Victim for 15 minutes before deciding to strike.

129    The Prosecution highlighted 2 cases which similarly involved the intrusion of private parts over clothes. Both the accused had pleaded guilty and were sentenced to 8 months’ imprisonment. The Prosecution further argued that an uplift to 10 months was appropriate in the present case.

130    In **_PP v Azmi Bin Mohammad Eunos_**, the accused Azmi pleaded guilty to two Section 354(1) Penal Code charges. His victim was a 15 year old male Azmi spotted his victim at the void deck and entered the same lift as his victim. Azmi pressed the victim for his phone number. When both exited the lift at the 9th floor, Azmi used his right hand and brushed the victim’s penis over his shorts. This constituted Azmi’s 1st charge.

131    Azmi’s victim then pressed for the lift and entered the lift. Azmi followed. The victim pressed the lift button for the 10th floor, and as the lift doors closed and ascended, Azmi used his right hand to brush (in an upward motion) the victim’s buttocks over his shorts. This constituted Azmi’s 2nd charge.

132    Azmi was heavily traced for drug-related antecedents. Azmi was sentenced to 8 months’ imprisonment for his 1st charge and 3 months’ imprisonment for his 2nd charge, both sentences ran concurrently giving rise to a global sentence of 8 months.

133    In **_GCO v PP_**, the accused GCO pleaded guilty to one Section 354(1) Penal Code charge and one Section 509 Penal Code charge. His victim was working with him on a project at a computer lab at the university in the early hours of the morning. They eventually fell asleep.

134    GCO woke up and noticed that the victim was asleep. He placed his hand through the opening of the shorts of his victim and touched the vagina area from underneath the shorts. This constituted GCO’s 1st charge under Section 354(1) of the Penal Code.

135    GCO’s 2nd charge, under Section 509 of the Penal Code, took place about 2 years earlier. He peeped at his victim, who was fully naked, in the female toilet of the hall of residence of the university.

136    GCO was untraced. GCO was sentenced to 8 months’ imprisonment for his 1st charge under Section 354(1) of the Penal Code, and a fine of $2,000 for his 2nd charge under Section 509 of the Penal Code.

### Mitigation and the Accused’s Submissions on Sentence

137    In response to the Prosecution’s submissions on sentence, the Accused reiterated that he was just trying to save the Victim and he was innocent and would not have pleaded guilty. The Accused added that he was a very helpful person who, for example, lent money to a lady with 5 children, whose husband was in jail.

### Decision on Sentence

138    I found that the facts of the present case revealed 2 or more offence-specific facts.

139    I noted that the Accused had touched the Victim’s private part (penis), for about 1 to 2 seconds. [^91]

140    Whilst I did not find that the touch was anything more than fleeting, I noted that the Accused had targeted the Victim after seeing him near the foot of Block X, and after loitering at the foot of Block X for a while, subsequently trailed him up to the 12th floor of Block X. The Accused also observed the Victim at the 12th floor before he approached the Victim. Premeditation was present.

141    As such, I found that the present case would appropriately be placed in Band 2 of the Kunesekaran framework.

142    I recognised that in the present case, there was no skin-on-skin contact, and as such, would not warrant the higher end of Band 2.

143    To the Accused’s credit, he had no antecedents.

144    However, the Accused claimed trial. The mitigating weight to be accorded to a timeous plea of guilt would not be applicable in this case.

145    The sentence to be meted to the Accused must serve the purpose of **retribution and deterrence**, to deter like-minded individuals from committing such offences.

146    I determined that **an imprisonment term of 8 months was appropriate** in this case.

147    This imprisonment term of 8 months would not be discordant with the sentences meted out in **_PP v Azmi Bin Mohammad Eunos_** and **_GCO v PP_**.

148    In **_PP v Azmi Bin Mohammad Eunos_**, the “modus operandi” of the accused Azmi was similar to that of the Accused. Azmi was sentenced to a global sentence of 8 months, for 2 charges. In our present case, the Accused had only been charged with, and found guilty under, 1 charge. Yet, Azmi had furnished a timeous plea of guilt, but the Accused had not. As such, comparing and contrasting the various factors, a sentence of 8 months for the Accused would not be incongruent with the sentence meted out to Azmi.

149    In **_GCO v PP_**, the accused GCO had, for his Section 354 Penal Code charge, placed his hand through the opening of the shorts of his victim and touched the vagina area from underneath the shorts. That, to me, was more aggravated than the touching of the Victim’s penis over clothes in the present case. That being said, GCO had furnished a timeous plea of guilt, but the Accused had not. As such, comparing and contrasting the various factors, a sentence of 8 months for the Accused would not be incongruent with the sentence meted out to GCO.

150    As the Accused was above the age of 50 at the time of the sentencing, caning was not a viable sentencing option.

## Conclusion

151    I sentenced the Accused to 8 months’ imprisonment. Given the imprisonment spectrum of two years, the facts of the case, and the case precedents, 8 months’ imprisonment would not be manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate.

152    The Accused, dissatisfied with the conviction and sentence has filed an appeal. The Accused is presently out on bail pending appeal.
