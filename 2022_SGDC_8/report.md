### District Judge Marvin Bay:

## INTRODUCTION

1       This case involves criminal proceeding brought by the State against the accused person, Mr Low Chee Keong. Mr Low was, at the material time, a senior officer in Keppel Singmarine Pte Ltd (“_Keppel Singmarine_”), heading the Purchasing and Analysis department of that company. His unit was responsible for inviting quotations from vendors, curating them and then forwarding these quotations to the Engineering Department of _Keppel Singmarine_ for a technical review to be conducted with a view to deriving the best option for _Keppel Singmarine’s_ client. Essentially, the prosecution contends that Mr Low had dishonestly concealed from his erstwhile employer the **_lowest_** bid in a bidding exercise which was one received from Hankook Engineering Pte Ltd (_Hankook_), a company handling marine consultancy works and in the supply of Korean-made marine off-chore equipment, in a tender process for the supply of seven moon pool hatch covers. Such hatch covers are fitted on marine vessels to enable them to undertake marine engineering works such as cable-laying, exploration and drilling, and to support diving operations. The hatch cover in the instant case had been intended to be fitted onto a vessel provisionally designated Hull 389 or ‘H 389’

2       The prosecution’s case is that Mr Low’s exclusion was a deliberate act, which was predicated on a motive was to ensure the tender would be awarded to **_Union Marine (Asia) Pte Ltd_**, which was owned by one Tay Heng Chuan **Raymond** (DW3), a known associate of Mr Low, and an individual the prosecution asserted to be a close friend of Mr Low.

## The charge

3       To this effect, Mr Low faced a single charge of cheating contrary to section 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code” or “PC”), which alleged as follows.

> (Mr Low) is charged that (he), in April 2015, in Singapore, being a Senior Procurement Manager of Keppel Singmarine Pte Ltd (“_Keppel Singmarine_”), deceived _Keppel Singmarine_, to wit, **_by dishonestly concealing the fact that Hankook Engineering Pte Ltd had submitted a quotation for the supply and installation of moon pool hydraulic hatch covers for the vessel H389_**, and by such manner of deception, (he had) **_dishonestly induced Keppel Singmarine to award the contract to Union Marine (Asia) Pte Ltd_**, an act which _Keppel Singmarine_ would not have done if it had not been so deceived and (he had) thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 420 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

> \[Emphasis added\]

## The law

4       Section 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) provides that:

> Whoever cheats and thereby dishonestly induces the person deceived to deliver any property to any person, or to make, alter or destroy the whole or any part of a valuable security, or anything which is signed or sealed, and which is capable of being converted into a valuable security, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine.

5       The offence of cheating encompasses a multitude of situations, section 415 of the Penal Code establishes the primacy of **_deception_** as the central identifier in all forms of cheating:

> Whoever, by **_deceiving_** any person, whether or not such deception was the sole or main inducement, fraudulently or dishonestly induces the person so deceived to deliver any property to any person, or to consent that any person shall retain any property, **_or intentionally induces the person so deceived to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit to do if he were not so deceived_**, and which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to any person in body, mind, reputation or property, is said to “cheat”.

> \[Emphasis added\]

6       Within the manifold forms of deception, the species that would fit Mr Low’s asserted criminality would be that in provided in Explanation 1, which states:

> A **_dishonest concealment_** of facts is a deception within the meaning of this section.

> \[Emphasis added\]

## THE PROSECUTION’S CASE

7       The trial encompassed some 17 days out of the 19 days logged in the record of proceedings. Much of the time was taken to expound on technical details such as the procurement process, setting out the essential documents (such as the Bid Analysis Table) and explaining peculiarities in contracting procedures for the highly specialised moon pool hatch covers intended to be installed onto vessels used in marine engineering and other offshore works. A considerable part of the trial was also devoted to detailed accounts of Mr Low’s interactions with his subordinates in the course of the bidding, analysis and contracting process for the moon pool hatches, encompassing a four-month period from late-January to May 2015, and which were (from their accounts) fraught with admonitions and threats when they expressed concerns over his management of the bids, particularly the perceived suppression of _Hankook’s_ bid. The evidence of the key prosecution witness of fact, PW2; Chee Zeng Jun Lawrence (“Mr Lawrence Chee”), a procurement officer working under Mr Low, took four days. Other prosecution witnesses also testified of the accused’s interactions with officers in other divisions of _Keppel Singmarine_, which included abrasive exchanges.

8       Given the above, a linear and granular recounting of the witness’ testimonies at trial would lead to unnecessary prolixity to these grounds. It would be more expedient to provide a listing of the prosecution witnesses explaining their roles in _Keppel Singmarine_ and their part they played in the transaction at the heart of these proceedings. Thus will be followed by a time-line and an outline of notable events, before a more detailed rendition of more salient areas of evidence of specific witnesses.

## List of prosecution witnesses

### Prosecution witnesses

9       The following witnesses provided evidence for the prosecution:

> **PW1, Peh Wan Hao Keith** (“Officer Peh”). The witness was a CPIB officer gave his evidence on 18 July 2019 and whose principal role was to introduce a statement by PW2, Lawrence Chee, which he received on 7 January 2016. This statement is essential to explaining the prosecution’s case and is set out in the later part of these grounds.

> **PW2, Chee Zeng Jun Lawrence** (“Lawrence Chee” or “Mr Chee”). This witness gave his evidence from 18-31 July 2019 and was senior purchasing officer who reported directly to Mr Low. Mr Chee was the officer who had prepared the Bid Analysis Table and had received (and protested, by his own account) Mr Low’s instructions to exclude Hankook’s bid. Mr Chee’s evidence will be set out in detail further in these grounds.

> **PW 3, Quincy Cheah** (“Quincy Cheah”). The witness gave his evidence on 31 July 2019 to 26 February 2020, and was purchasing and subcontracts manager at _Keppel Singmarine_., and corroborated Mr Chee’s evidence on the circumstances behind the material procurement.

> **PW4, Poon Tai Lum.** The witness gave his evidence on 27-28 February 2020, and was the General Manager at _Keppel Singmarine_., and gave evidence on the company’s business processes, including the subcontracting work upon which quotations were received for moon pool hydraulic hatch covers, and how Bid Analysis Tables were used.

> **PW5, Quek Shian Pin.** The witness gave his evidence on 27-28 February 2020 and was a Project Manager at _Keppel Singmarine_. and gave evidence on how the competing bids received from Mr Low’s purchasing unit **_should_** have been properly represented.

> **PW6, Gnanapra Kasam Chinnadurai** (‘Mr Chinna’). The witness gave his evidence on 28 February-2 March 2020, and was an assistant manager at the engineering division, and knew Mr Loh was the ‘procurement manager’ with whom he had principally interacted over the moon pool acquisition. Mr Chinna had found Union Marine’s proposal inadequately detailed and had raised formal technical comments. He had been subsequently accused by Mr Low of ‘_delaying the project’_.[^1]

> **PW7, Nigel Koh Leong (**Nigel Koh **or ‘**Dr Koh’**).** The witness gave his evidence on 2 March 2020, and was a senior design manager at _Keppel Singmarine’s_ Marine Technology Development (MTD) division, and had in reviewing the moon pool cover project, received a message from Mr Low on 23 January 2015 not to “_tie down to vendors_”[^2] for the moon pool cover design, which the former took to mean that Mr Low was asking for the consideration of designs from a bigger pool of potential vendors rather than their usual supplier; a company called “TTS”. It was Dr Koh’s evidence[^3] that he was never shown the proposed design from _Hankook_ despite Mr Low’s prior communication to him.

> **PW8, Abu Bakar Bin Mohd Nor** (“Mr Abu Bakar”). The witness gave his evidence on 3 March 2020 and was the managing director in _Keppel Singmarine_ at the material time and had been given the Bid Analysis Table **_without_** the _Hankook_ bid. Mr Abu Bakar, who explained the rationale for accepting the lowest bid when essential parameters were met, also recalled Mr Low telling him that there were only two bids depicted as only “_Union Marine and TTS are able to quote_”[^4] and five vendors that had declined even to quote.

> **PW9, Li Yong Xing** (“Mr Li”). The witness gave his evidence on 4 March 2020, and was the General Manager of _Hankook_ at the material time, Mr Li indicated that his company had done extensive business with Jurong Shipyard, Keppel Shipyard, Keppel Marine, Sembawang Shipyard as well as local small and medium enterprises. He added that _Hankook_ was competent with moon pool hatch projects as they had strong support from their suppliers in South Korea.

> (x)     **PW10, Chan Jian Yun** (Officer Chan). was a CPIB investigation officer who had uncovered bank transactions that were deemed suspicious. These involved deposits that Mr Low had made to his bank account in early 2015. The sums flagged included a cash deposit of $100 000 on 20 January 2015, two $5000 deposits on 5 February 2015, $50 000 deposited on 19 March 2015, a deposit of 10 000 on 27 May 2015, and finally deposits of $10 000 and $80 000 on 16 June 2015 and 17 June 2015

## Brief outline of the prosecution’s case

10     Mr Low headed the Purchasing and Analysis Department of _Keppel Singmarine_, which was responsible for inviting quotations from vendors and forwarding these quotations to the Engineering Department for technical review. Essentially, the charge contended that Mr Low had dishonestly concealed from his erstwhile employer _Keppel Singmarine_ the lowest bid in a bidding exercise which was one received from Hankook Engineering Pte Ltd (_Hankook_) in a tender process for seven moon pool hatch covers. As briefly touched on in the foregoing, the prosecution’s case is that Mr Low’s motive was to ensure the tender would be awarded to **_Union Marine (Asia) Pte Ltd_**, which was owned by one Tay Heng Chuan Raymond (“Raymond Tay”)[^5] a known associate of Mr Low, and an individual the prosecution asserted to be a close friend of Mr Low.

### Course of conduct demonstrating preference for Union Marine

11     To prove its case, the prosecution had underscored Mr Low’s course of conduct beginning with a direction to a subordinate to reject _Hankook’s_ bid on 9 March 2015, after an imposed “_final deadline_” was missed. Mr Low’s intent to exclude _Hankook_ from consideration was manifested again on 18 March 2015, when Mr Low had ordered this subordinate colleague, Mr Chee Zeng Jun Lawrence (PW2), to remove _Hankook_’s bid of $1 650 000 (or US$1,250,000) from a Bid Analysis Table (also “BAT” or “Bid Table”) for the seven moon- pool hatch covers to be installed onto the vessel designated H 389. As indicated, PW2 Mr Chee was the principal witness of fact for the prosecution, having provided a statement[^6] to investigators with a detailed timeline setting out a litany of alleged irregularities perpetrated by Mr Low in the run up to the exclusion of Hankook’s bid.

12     The prosecution contended that Mr Low acted to remove the _Hankook_ quotation notwithstanding his knowledge that a quotation from _Hankook_ **_should_** properly have been included in the Bid Analysis Table. The removal of the _Hankook_ had had resulted in Union Marine’s substantially higher bid of $2 541 000 (US$1,925,000) being selected as the lower of two remaining bids standing on the Bid Analysis Table (TTS Marine had a placed a higher bid of $2 682 000), and thus positioning that bid for acceptance. The prosecution’s case is that Mr Low had also contrived to procure the requisite signatures on the Bid Analysis Table dated 9 April 2015 through “_a combination of coercion and deception_” and had by design failed to give notice to _Keppel Singmarine’s_ senior management of the quotation from _Hankook_ when the Bid Analysis Table was tabled for their approval.

13     Upon the above, the senior management of _Keppel Singmarine_ had, in ignorance of _Hankook’s_ bid, awarded the contract to Union Marine, which eventuated in the latter company and its officers enjoying a gain that was wrongfully obtained. The prosecution also contended that Mr Low, in addition to effectively securing the bid, **_continued_** to show undue favour to Union Marine, primarily in the use of his official position to grant terms favourable to Union Marine. Their case also being that the granting of these unduly favourable terms would inevitably come at the expense of his employer; _Keppel Singmarine_, and would count as _indicia_ of the closeness of the antecedent relationship between Mr Low and Union Marine’s Mr Raymond Tay.

### Defence that discretion to exclude was properly exercised

14     Mr Low’s principal defence was that he was acting in the proper exercise of his discretion in excluding the bid, and that the bid need not gave been reflected. Essentially Mr Low’s argument was that there had been no bad faith in his exercise of the discretion to exclude the quote, as there had been valid bases for such exclusion. This position is exemplified in \[10\] of the defence’s Reply Submissions which argued that “_Mr Low had bona fide exercised his managerial, operational, functional and/or otherwise reasonable discretion to disqualify Hankook on purely legitimate and/or valid commercial grounds. There was no element of dishonesty or such other venal motives/intentions present_”.

### Evidence from Keppel Singmarine executives that bids once tendered, should not be excluded

15     To refute the defence that Mr Low had properly exercised his discretion as procurement head at _Keppel Singmarine_, the prosecution called a number of witnesses from _Keppel Singmarine_ to address whether bids could be excluded. The gist of the evidence from these witnesses is that information of **_all_** bids should have been included. Since this is a point of considerable significance, a precis of their evidence is in order. PW 8; Mr Abu Bakar bin Mohd Nor (“Mr Abu Bakar”), had been _Keppel Singmarine’s_ Managing Director, and was the final signatory for the Bid Analysis Table, gave evidence that a Bid Analysis Table operated as a veritable dashboard to allow easy access to all salient information on the bidders for the project. The information should thus **_even_** have included vendors who were invited but declined to quote, _a fortiori_ bids that had been tendered but not recommended by the team collating the bids.

16     Mr Abu Bakar made it clear that the inclusion of all invited parties was for the purpose of being able form a full picture in decision making. Mr Abu Bakar asserted that even quotations that had been marked for rejection or as non-preferred on the basis of engineering issues, had to be included in the Bid Analysis Table.

### Prosecution’s case that at least three bids should be placed before the deciding panel

17     Significantly, it was Mr Abu Bakar’s evidence that there should ordinarily be a minimum of three quotations in the Bid Analysis Table for _Keppel Singmarine’s_ management to review. He added that any deviation had to be specifically **_justified_** and **_explained_** to him. The witness recalled that Mr Low sought to explain that there had only been two vendors, Union Marine and TTS, that had been able to provide quotations, and that five other vendors not been in a position to offer any quotations. According to Mr Abu Bakar, he was never told that _Hankook_ had by the time the panel convened, submitted a final technical and priced quote for the H389 project. This ought, in his view, to have constituted the **_third_** quote.

### Incongruity that the excluded third quote was lower than the budget allocated, while the two presented quotes exceeded the stipulated budget

18     Other than the incongruity of there being just two bids on record, Mr Abu Bakar pointed to an even greater anomaly that _Hankook’s_ excluded quote would have been **_below_** that given budget, even as **_both_** TTS Marine’s and Union Marine’s quotes exceeded the budget of $2 235 000, with an excess of $306 000 being required to meet Union Marine’s quote of $2 541 000. Hankook’s quote[^7] for the equivalent number of HPU units was $ 1 650 000 (also expressed as US $1 250 000). Mr Abu Bakar had only come into knowledge that Hankook had indeed tendered such a quote when problems had developed in the project undertaken by Union Marine in relation to the operability of the hatch covers. _Keppel Singmarine_ had sought competent parties to remedy the issues when he realised that _Hankook_ had indeed given a prior quote. It is understood that Hankook’s services were subsequently resorted to salvage the situation

19     PW4, Poon Tai Lum; the General Manager (Commercial) of _Keppel Singmarine_ echoed the position taken by Mr Abu Bakar, testifying that he too had been unaware of Hankook’s quotation, and whose position was that all quotations received ought be reflected in the Bid Analysis Table. Mr Poon added thar vendors would be invited to requote if their quotations fell short of specifications. Where any invited party declined to quote, or eschewed from re-quoting, these would still be listed in the Bid Analysis Table with annotations indicating positions such as their disinclination to quote, or that their quote did not conform with technical specifications.

20     This stance for all quotations being incorporated in the Bid Analysis Table, was also shared by PW5 Mr Quek Shian Pin, the Project Manager for the Hull 389 vessel project. Mr Quek had also stated himself also be unaware of _Hankook’s_ bid when he had signed off on Union Marine’s quotation.

### Accused’s subordinates’ unease about his departure from Keppel Singmarine’s standard procedure

21     In the same vein the prosecution was able to show Mr Low’s own subordinates in _Keppel Singmarine’s_ Purchasing and Analysis department (“purchasing department”) to demonstrate considerable unease at the accused’s departure from _Keppel Singmarine’s_ policy to include all quotations in the Bid Analysis Table, with the conventional practice being for the quotation to be incorporated into the Table, with reasons being given if the quotations were not recommended for selection. Both PW2; Lawrence Chee and PW3; Quincy Cheah Ka-Yip from the purchasing department[^8] gave the same response that the Bid Analysis Table ought incorporate **_all_** the vendors who had been invited to quote. Vendors failing to respond or those with problematic quotations should also have been listed for completeness.

### Accused’s attempts to gloss over issues from Union Marine’s bid at the engineering review

22     An engineering review was a precursor and integral part of the process leading to the final evaluation and endorsement of the recommended bid by the panel. In this respect, the prosecution has produced PW6 Gnanapra Kasam Chinnadurai (Mr Chinna) from the Engineering department, whose approval as a signatory for the Bid Analysis Table was needed. Mr Chinna had given his account of pressure tactics from Mr Low to close a comments sheet for Union Marine’s proposal despite his flagging of errors in Union Marine’s quotation with his concern of the document not containing preliminary drawings. In relation to the imposed, Mr Chinna had accused Mr Low of raising his voice and threatening him with adverse consequences should the project be delayed by the queries raised in his office. Mr Chinna had keep his superior apprised of Mr Low’s accusations, but did close the comments sheet and sign the Bid Analysis Table. Equally significantly. Mr Chinna stated that _Hankook’s_ quotation was **_not_** brought to his attention, as, unlike the Union Marine bid, the _Hankook_ bid had, incongruously, never been flagged for Engineering review.

### An engineering review could have been completed well before the Bid Analysis Table was lain for Keppel Singmarine’s senior officers to consider

23     Another aspect which fuelled suspicion was the fact that, according to Mr Chinnadurai, _Hankook’s_ bid could have cleared engineering review in just **_three to five days_** if Mr Low had been minded to send a quotation for that review same when he received Exhibit P8 (which was _Hankook’s_ detailed proposal) on 18 March 2015. The facts instead show that Mr Low had incongruously proceeded with just the **_two_** recommended quotations of Union Marine’s and TTS’s (higher priced bid) for completion of the Bid Analysis Table, which was drawn up on 9 April 2015[^9] some **_three weeks_** after 18 March 2015.

### Favourable handling of Union Marine’s quotation

24     The prosecution had also flagged Mr Low’s inexplicably favourable handling of Union Marine’s quotation throughout the procurement process, noting that he had sent Union Marine’s _unpriced_ quotation for urgent Engineering review on 12 February 2015. This was regarded as an anomaly as it was considered premature to undertake an engineering review for an _unpriced_ proposal as the unresolved price might be too high for _Keppel Singmarine_ to accept. The prosecution was also able to show that Mr Low had a meeting with Union Marine’s Raymond Tay, but not _Hankook_, with a Hankook representative, Mr Li Yong Xing[^10], categorically stating that there had not been any meeting arranged for his company in respect of its bid, which had been submitted at about the same time.

25     On highlighting other conduct that pointed to Mr Low exercising an unwarranted preference the Union Marine bid, the prosecution sought to show that Mr Low had imposed unrealistic deadlines on _Hankook_, which Union Marine did not seem to be subject to. The prosecution had asserted that Mr Low had also exhibited undue haste after having endorsed the Bid Analysis Table for Union Marine to be the recommended vendor, in the manner of his imposition of pressure on Mr Lawrence Chee to secure the remaining signatures of designated _Keppel Singmarine_ signatories for the commencement of order placement even before securing the vessel owner’s agreement. Mr Chee had, in his testimony at the first day of the trial, given his evidence that usual practice entailed, metaphorically speaking, seeking the owner’s ‘blessings’ first before placing the order.

### Prosecution witness’ testimony that the Hankook quotation contained sufficient detail for engineering review but not Union Marine’s

26     The prosecution had argued that Mr Low’s explanations for excluding _Hankook_ from the Bid Analysis Table are wholly untenable as prosecution witnesses had confirmed that the _Hankook_ proposals at hand contained sufficient details for an engineering review to be undertaken and hence ought not be excluded from consideration. In this regard, Mr Chinna had inveighed in to state that _Hankook’s_ bid offer sheet[^11] dated 16 February 2015, which constituted the company’s first quote, was **_sufficient_** for such a purpose as the offer was accompanied by preliminary drawings, which rendered the hatch covers for the project in the required level of specificity[^12]. The rendition of hatches would give an important indication of the bidder’s experience and probable ability to execute this critical detail. It was an ironic counterpoint that **_Union Marine’s_** proposal[^13], dated 12 February 2015, failed to incorporate what Mr Chinna would regard as proper technical drawings[^14], but merely close up line illustrations from _Parosha Innovators (“Parosha”)_, which was the Dutch company whose moon pool hatch cover product was sought to be used by Union Marine for the project. The facts indicate that _Hankook_ having submitted the initial quotation[^15] on 16 February 2015, had complied with Mr Low’s latter requests and tendered the fully fleshed out and priced proposal on 18 March 2015, and the Bid Table was only completed some **_three weeks_** later on 9 April 2015. My own observation would be that given the amount involved, and the scale of the project, Mr Low would have had more than adequate time within this period to properly reflect and consider if his exclusion of _Hankook_ was unwarranted.

### Accused’s favour of Union Marine continued after the awarding of the project

27     After the award of the moon pool assignment to Union Marine, the prosecution also asserted the existence of instances of Mr Low militating a deviation from _Keppel Singmarine’s_ existing business practices in a manner that seemingly favoured Union Marine, including that of relaxing the performance guarantee requirements for Union Marine. Mr Low was noted to be abrasive and confrontational with subordinate staff questioning how the Hull 389 procurement process, and subsequent performance and payment terms, were being undertaken, with Mr Lawrence Chee alleging to having suffering a major professional setback when Mr Low, his reporting officer had seen fit to downgrade Mr Chee’s yearly performance appraisal, which the latter believed to be an apparent reprisal for their confrontations over these issues.

### Prosecution’s assertion of close relationship between accused and Union Marine head

28     An aspect of some circumstantial significance would be Mr Low’s relationship with Union Marine’s Raymond Tay. Both the prosecution’s assertions and Mr Low’s response will be covered in greater detail in these grounds. Suffice to say in this _precis_ of the prosecution’s case, Mr Low was slow to acknowledge his association Mr Tay on a personal level. At trial, the degree of association had wavered from that of a mere business associate, which was the equivalent of “_any supplier_” and was not even a “_friend_”, to a “_friend_” but “_not a good friend_”.

### Accused’s loan of $50 000 to Union Marine’s Mr Raymond Tay

29     An aspect of the factual matrix that was inconvenient to the accused’s narrative that Mr Low and Mr Tay were not close would-be Mr Low’s acknowledgement that he had lent Mr Tay a sum of $50,000 in the past. The prosecution was also able to show that Mr Tay had deleted his _WhatsApp_ messages with Mr Low upon learning of the CPIB’s investigations against the latter.

### Large deposits made by the accused between January 2015 and June 2015

30     Another aspect of the prosecution’s circumstantial case would be Mr Low’s deposition of considerable sums between January 2015 and June 2015 into his bank account. Mr Low had contended that these funds came from a gift of $250,000 from his own grandmother.

## Timeline of events

31     The following is a timeline of events to assist in analysing the factual matrix[^16]. The entries are set out in some detail to allow a quick grasp of this case where an understanding the sequence of events also with the historical context of Mr Low’s dealing with the various parties, including his subordinates, external stakeholders and other _Keppel Singmarine_ staff is essential. This is done with a view to reducing the need for prolix narration in the main body of these grounds:

> **\-20 January 2015-** Mr Low deposited a sum of $100 000 into his bank account.

> **\-23 January 2015**\- In an email sent at 9.50pm, Dr Nigel Koh officially notified Mr Shafiquzzaman (copied to Mr Low) of his intent to use TTS Marine as vendor.

> **\-23 January 2015**\- In his response under an hour later at 10.34 pm, Mr Low queried if the intent to use TTS Marine as vendor for the supply of moon pool covers for vessel Hull 389 was appropriate, and also admonished Dr Koh not to “_tie down_” to any vendors.

> **\-24 January 2015**\- Dr Nigel Koh pushed back to assure that there is nothing irregular in contacting TTS Marine first to make inquiries and that _Keppel Singmarine_ was entitled to switch vendors if they were unable to agree with TTS Marine’s terms and conditions.

> \-**26 January 2015**\- Mr Low firmly responded that it would be inadvisable to be committed to TTS Marine’s design proposals without having reviewed their terms and pricing proposals.

> \-**27 January 2015**\- At Mr Low’s behest, PW2 Lawrence Chee sent Requests for Quotations (RFQ) from a list provided by the accused. The list comprised TTS Marine, Union Marine, _Hankook_, “_Nufoss_”, “_Macgregor_” and “_Sea2Sea_”.

> **\-29 January 2015**\-**TTS Marine** provided its quotation.

> **\-30 January 2015**\- Mr Low added two more marine engineering firms to the RFQ listing, these being “_Seaonics_” and “_AEG_”.

> \-**12 February 2015**\-Union Marine sent an **_unpriced_** technical proposal, and Mr Low forwarded the proposal to the Engineering department and MTD to review.

> \-**16 February 2015**\-Noting they had made a technical error, Union Marine revised their proposal to incorporate seven hydraulic power units (HPUs) for moon pool cover hatches.

> \-**16 February 2015**\-_Hankook_ sent a **_priced_** quotation. _Hankook’s_ proposal had erroneously quoted for four HPUs for hatches rather than the seven intended.

> \-**17 February 2015**\-_Hankook’s_ error was rectified and a revised priced quotation for seven HPUs for the hatches was received.

> \-**18 February 2015**\-_Hankook’s_ quotation was sent for Engineering review.

> **\-25 February 2015**\-Union Marine sent a **_priced_** quotation.

> **\-26 February 2015**\- Mr Shafiquzzaman had asked for general arrangement (GA) drawings from Union Marine. Mr Low’s response, apparently on Union Marine’s behalf, were that the drawings would only be supplied upon confirmation of the order by _Keppel Singmarine_. Mr Shafiquzzaman had received a set of GA drawings earlier from Hankook and requested Union Marine to follow Hankook’s example in providing a drawing of an existing design which was a ‘_close fit’_ to present project[^17].Mr Low promised to “_try to get_” on Union Marine’s behalf.

> Mr Chee noted that Mr Raymond Tay from Union Marine contacted Mr Low directly, and Mr Chee was only aware that Union Marine’s GA drawing were ‘OK’ when he was copied in a message from Mr Shafiquzzaman on **3 March 2015**.

> \-**3 March 2015**\- Mr Low had informed Mr Ching You Yi, the costing manager from the Budget department that upon the latter’s queries, no quotes had been received from marine engineering firms _AEG_ and _Nufoss_.

> \-**6 March 2015**\- Mr Low had directed for quotations on both a ‘flush-type’ moon pool and a foldable-type moon pool cover. _Hankook_ was given a deadline as Mr Low had informed Mr Chee that they were “_running out of time_’ and that Hankook’s bid should be rejected “_if they can’t commit to specs on time_”. **_A deadline of 9 March 2015 was thus imposed on Hankook_**.

> \-**9 March 2015**\- Neither _Hankook_ nor Union Marine had complied to submit a priced quotation, and Mr Chee had sent a ‘chaser’.

> \-**12 March 2015**\- At 3.27 pm, Union Marine had asked to meet. The meeting was convened at 4.30 pm with Mr Chee, Mr Low and Union Marine’s Raymond Tay in attendance. Union Marine was asked to give their best price in three currencies and explore using a maker from China as an alternative to _Parosha_, cited in their proposal.

> Hankook sent a scope of supply quotation but was told of an apparent error in the number of hydraulic power units in their quote. Mr Low would later deride this as a ‘_cut and paste’_ job from a previous quotation, which caused him to lose his confidence in _Hankook_, and consequently form the basis of his decision to exclude the company from the Bid Analysis Table.

> **\-18 March 2015**\- _Hankook_, which had engaged in a series of clarificatory exchanges since 12 March 2015 with Mr Chee and Mr Low, submitted an updated priced quotation[^18]. Mr Chee had tabulated the priced quotations from the three participating vendors; TTS Marine, Union Marine and Hankook and had submitted these for Mr Low’s review. Mr Low had questioned Mr Chee “_on the capability of Hankook for this equipment_”.[^19] Thereafter Mr Chee “**_was instructed to remove Hankook from_** (his) **_Bid Analysis Table_** _as_ (Mr Low) _explained to_ (him) _that_ (_Hankook)_ **_was not qualified to design_** _and was not “apple to apple” compared to Union Marine and TTS Marine’s quotations_, (he) **_was told not to give the wrong impression to_** (their) **_management with the price indicated from Hankook_**_._“[^20]

> **\-19 March 2015-** Mr Low deposited $50 000 to his own bank account

> **\-23 March 2015**\- Mr Chee had been asked to verify with Hankook that they were proposing a holistic turn-key solution. Mr Low had also sent further requests for quotations from _Cargocare Asia_ and _AEG_ (seemingly belying accused’s claims that time was running out)_._ Mr Chee was told however that the Engineering review would focus **_solely_** on Union Marine.

> \- **26 March 2015**\- **Union Marine** reverted with an updated proposal.[^21] PW6 Gnanapra Kasam Chinnadurai (“Mr Chinna”) from _Keppel Singmarine’s_ Engineering department raised further comments, leading to a confrontation with the accused who blamed the former for exposing their company to potential delay.

> **\-1 April 2015**\- The Engineering review had been completed and Union Marine had then requested a meeting to discuss the final price on 6 April 2015.

> **\-6 April 2015**\- At the negotiation meeting, Mr Low had made a call to Mr Ching You Yi from the Budgeting division to ask for an increase in the budget, as Union Marine’s bid had **_exceeded_** the stipulated budget. Mr Chee had also been asked to follow through with the Budgeting department, and also to submit Union Marine’s proposal for the approval of the owner of vessel H 389.

> **\-9 April 2015**\- Mr Chee was told by Mr Low to incorporate Union Marine’s final offer of $2 541 000 onto the Bid Analysis Table. This was below TTS Marine’s bid of $ 2 683 000, but was $306 000 above the allocated budget $ 2 235 000.

> **\-20 April 2015-** At Mr Low’s behest, Mr Chee made multiple requests for Mr Quek to give “the green light”, but Mr Quek had demurred.

> **\-24 April 2015**\- Mr Low had intervened directly to call for a meeting at his office and obtained both Mr Quek’s concurrence to proceed in an email, and the former’s signature on the Bid Analysis Table.

> **\-** _Between_ **24 April 2015** _and_ **27 April 2015**\- Mr Chee had approached _Keppel Singmarine’s_ Executive Director Mr Toh Ko Lin for his signature. He indicated that Mr Toh had been initially reluctant to sign as he had noted an additional column assigned by costing and had assumed that the costing had been catered from a budget proposed by TTS Marine[^22], and was of the view that TTS Marine should undertake the job. Mr Low had taken the Bid Analysis Table to both the Managing Director and the Executive Director and obtained their signatures during a General Meeting.

> After the signatures were obtained, Mr Low had asked Mr Chee to place the order with Union Marine. This was done **_before_** the owners of Hull 389 had closed their last comment.

## Detailed accounts of select witnesses for the prosecution

## Evidence of PW2 Lawrence Chee

32     Mr Lawrence Chee had been the principal witness of fact of events on the ground during the material period, which had stretched from late January 2015 to August of that year, when he was made to respond to a ‘whistle-blower’ letter where claims of impropriety in the procurement process for Hull 389 had been made, allegedly by an unknown person using Mr Chee’s name. When the matter had been escalated to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB), Mr Chee had also appended a detailed account to authorities on 7 January 2016. In this part of the grounds, I will give a _precis_ of his evidence, drawing principally from that document, since this evidence was essentially not found to be discrepant from his court testimony.

33     Mr Chee was an ASMI[^24] scholar who had joined _Keppel Singmarine_ as an Assistant Purchasing Officer on 1 June 2013, and worked under Mr Low and PW2 Mr Quincy Cheah. The purchasing department’s work included sending requests for quotation (RFQ), submitting proposals for engineering review. These, and other tasks which included the proposing of selected vendors for project/owner acceptance and the final price negotiation with vendor would require the acceptance and approval of Mr Low.

### Demand by accused to expand group of bidders to quote for the moon pool cover contract

34     The sequence of events in relation with the procurement of the moon pool covers begins on 23 January 2015, when Mr Chee received an email from Dr Nigel Koh and Mr Md Shafiquzzaman[^25], who were managers from the Marine Technological Design (MTD) division[^26], which concerned their intent to request a design for moon pool covers from their usual source; TTS Marine (“TTS”), as Dr Koh had expected to be able to “_get good service and price from TTS”_. This did not go well with the accused. In the email chain, Mr Chee had noted Mr Low’s vehement exhortation “_not to tie down to vendors into our design”_ unless price, delivery and contractual terms were favourable to _Keppel Singmarine_.

35     Mr Chee took this to mean that Mr Low had been against the notion of allowing “_the designer to predetermine the vendor for the supply of the moon pool hatch cover for the ship_”.[^27] By this, he was signalling his opposition to TTS Marine simply being engaged without a competitive bid. Mr Low’s belligerent tone, in advocating that _Keppel Singmarine_ should not just engage TTS Marine but also open the field to other moon pool suppliers, is quite evident in his blunt response to Dr Nigel Koh on 26 January 2015[^28]:

> Njgel

> If You need moon pool cover to determine the size of the moon pool? So if TTS give you a very small moon pool covers, MTD will use that to size your moon pool accordingly for model testing?? **_The way you explain has no logic_**.

> And for our Company's Interest, I don't understand why you don't agree to our approach. If you getting TTS moon pool covers and fixed it into our design now without concerning price, delivery time and contractual terms, and thinks that we can easily switch vendors last min after your model test, **_then I think this is really a big problem._**

36     Mr Chee had been privy to the communication as he was the lead purchaser for fitments to Hull 389 and his colleague Mr Varuna Ng had been the dedicated purchaser for moon pool covers. He noted that Mr Low had been especially keen to have his way, as he (Mr Chee) had been “_concurrently instructed”_ to “_chase_” PW6 Gnanapra Kasam Chinnadurai (“Mr Chinna”) from the Engineering departments for purchase specifications. Mr Chinna had duly issued purchase specifications on 27 January 2015. Having got his way to open the field to a pool of potential vendors, Mr Low directed Mr Chee to send to vendors whom the former had specified to obtained requests for quotations (RFQ). Mr Low’s list included Union Marine, TTS, and _Hankook_, along with other marine engineering companies “_Nufoss_”, “_Macgregor_” and “_Sea2Sea_”. On 30 January 2015, Mr Low had ‘granted clearance to two more vendors to approach for RFQ, being “_Seaonics_” and “_AEG_”.

### Accused’s active promotion of the Union Marine bid

37     Union Marine had been the first company to respond, and had on 12 February 2015, sent an **_unpriced_** technical proposal to _Keppel Singmarine’s_ purchasing department, and Mr Chee had been “_immediately instructed_” to commence engineering review for the Union Marine bid with his counterparts from the Marine Technological Design and the Engineering team[^29]. Mr Low’s proactivity was quite evident that even as the Engineering review was being undertaken, he had concurrently on 16 February 2015, forwarded the technical proposal to the Marine Technology Design unit to commence the design work[^30]. It is notable that this was a bare-bones proposal, and that the accused explaining the absence of drawings on Union Marines’s behalf “_Hi Nigel, Pls use the attached technical proposal for your design work._ **_There will be no preliminary drawing at this stage reason because all these hatches are custom made and their factory will only start their drawing when we place the order_**”, evidencing the off-line communications between the accused and officers of Union Marine, even while Mr Low was purporting to hold a competitive bidding procurement process.

38     It was on this day; 16 February 2015, too, that a fully **_priced_** quotation was received from _Hankook_. Mr Chee noted that at this juncture, Union Marine has not submitted their priced quotation yet. Hankook rectified their error on the very next day and a revised priced quotation for seven hydraulic power units (HPUs) for the hatches was received. Union Marine had only reverted with a priced quotation on 25 February 2015. Union Marine sent a priced quotation. Mr Chee noted that in relation to the supply of drawings for engineering review, Mr Raymond Tay from Union Marine contacted Mr Low directly rather than via himself as the designated point person.

### Sequence of events leading to the exclusion of Hankook’s bid

39     The sequence of events leading to _Hankook’s_ exclusion began on 3 March 2015, when the accused had directed for **_revised_** quotations to show both a ‘flush-type’ moon pool and a foldable-type moon pool cover. _Hankook_ representatives, including PW9 Li Yong Xing had requested a technical meeting on 4 March 2016. According to Mr Chee[^31], this meeting **_never_** occurred. _Hankook_ was peremptorily given a deadline by Mr Low who had directed Mr Chee to draft an email[^32] on the following terms:

> Hi Lawrence,

> Pls give them a deadline… we are running out of time, If Hankook cannot commit a proper specs, please reject then.

40     Mr Chee understood the instruction to mean to “_to reject Hankook if they can't commit a proper specs on the deadline_”.[^33] Upon this direction, Mr Chee had imposed a deadline of 9 March 2015 on _Hankook_. The date: 9 March 2015, came and went, but neither _Hankook_ nor Union Marine had sent any revised quotation, prompting Mr Chee to send a chaser to both _Hankook_ and Union Marine.

### Apparent inequality in treatment in allowing Union Marine to source for new makers three days after Hankook was threatened with rejection for not meeting the imposed deadline

41     The inequality in treatment between the two contenders became more pronounced, when on 12 March at 3. 27pm. Union Marine had sent Mr Chee a request to meet up on 4. 30pm the same day for price negotiation, and was granted a personal meeting between Mr Chee, Mr Low and Union Marine’s Raymond Tay. As an interesting development, Mr Low had asked not just for a finalised ‘best-price’ but had also suggested that Union Marine “_could also check whether they can have alternative maker from China for_ (Keppel Singmarine’s) _consideration_.”

42     The proffering of the above option pointed to there being some fluidity in the situation as Mr Low seemed content to **_give time_** for Union Marine on 12 March 2015, to source for alternative makers, even while he had threatened to cut off _Hankook_ from contention for the alleged tardy submission three days earlier on 9 March 2015. This also suggested that _Keppel Singmarine_ was rather catholic in its preferences for the maker of the moon pool hatches, apparently holding no special attachment to the _Parosha_ brand proposed by Union Marine. From the context, Mr Low seemed to be holding onto a possibility that an alternative Chinese maker could offer better terms. This area was unfortunately not explored further during the examination of both Mr Chee and Mr Low of the relevant passage[^34] at trial, but the notion of the accused allowing time and space for this exploration of alternative moon pool makers by Union Marine ran starkly against his inveighing against _Hankook_, and threatening a bid rejection “_because we are running out of time_” three days earlier.

### Accused’s instruction to remove Hankook occurred while Keppel Singmarine was still soliciting for bids from other marine engineering firms

43     PW2, Mr Chee had noted that _Hankook_ had been responsive to the purchasing department’s requests and compliant in expeditiously submitting information on pricing and specifications. He had thus tabulated the data and pricing information supplied by _Hankook_, and the other bidders. He was surprised that Mr Low had then questioned _Hankook’s_ competence and then purported to exclude _Hankook’s_ bid on the basis that the bid was not “_apple to apple_” compared to Union Marine and TTS Marine’s higher bids. Mr Chee recounted this episode[^35] in his letter to CPIB as follows:

> On 18th March, Hankook submitted their updated priced quotation. From here, I have tabulated the prices receipt from all the participating vendors including Hankook into the bid analysis and submit for Patrick[^36] review. Patrick questioned me on the capability of Hankook for this equipment.

> Hence I was instructed to remove Hankook from my bid analysis as he explained to me that they are not qualified to design and was not "_apple to apple_” compared to Union Marine and TTS. 1 was told not give the wrong impression to our management with the price indicated from Hankook.

44     Mr Chee had been perplexed as from his perspective, the _Hankook_ proposal was “c_omparable_” to the other two bids and had all the relevant information that was required to be input to the Bid Analysis Table[^37]. Notwithstanding the direction to exclude _Hankook_, the accused had, on 23 March 2015, continued to instruct Mr Chee to confirm whether _Hankook’s_ quotation was a full turn-key solution for moon pool hatch covers which included material for equipment, engineering design, testing, fabricating and certification approval, which _Hankook_ confirmed to be the case on the same day.

45      _Hankook’s_ affirmative response (on the same day: 23 March 2015) to the inquiries, as to their commitment to undertake a full turn-key job for the price quoted, did nothing to induce any reconsideration on the accused’s part. Mr Low had instead instructed that only Union Marine’s bid proceed for the engineering review. He had instead sent requests for quotations (RFQs) from two other marine engineering companies “_Cargocare Asia”_ and “_AEG_” again.

### Accused’s asserted pro-activity in paving the way for Union Marine’s bid and in granting favourable terms after the bid is accepted

46     Mr Chee noted Mr Low taking a direct hand in ensuring that Union Marine’s bid would sail through despite the quote being priced **_above_** the stipulated budget for the moon pool project. In early April 2015, after the Engineering department had completed their review on Union Marine’s bid, the latter company had requested a meeting 6 April 2015. At the negotiation meeting, Mr Low had made a call to Mr Ching You Yi from the Budgeting division to ask for an increase in the budget, as Union Marine’s bid had exceeded the stipulated budget. Mr Chee had also been asked to follow through with the Budgeting department, and also to submit Union Marine’s proposal for the approval of the owner of vessel H 389.

### Non-inclusion of Hankook’s quotation in the Bid Analysis Table

47     It was also on 9 April 2015 that Mr Low had directed PW2 to incorporate Union Marine’s final offer of $2 541 000 onto the Bid Analysis Table. As mentioned, Union Marine’s bid was below TTS Marine’s quote of $ 2 683 000 but was $306 000 above the allocated budget $ 2 235 000. This fact was referred to at the upper right hand of the Table[^38] to state.

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="48.54%"> <col width="51.46%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Budget Assigned</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">SGD 2,235,000</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Additional Budget Assigned (from Costing)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">SGD 306,000</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Less the expenditure</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">SGD 2,541,000</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Budget balance</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">0</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

48     Only the quotations by TTS Marine and Union Marine appeared as priced bids in the Bid Analysis Table. The Table also tabulated a “LIST OF VENDORS WHOM (_sic_) DECLINED TO QUOTE” which itemised the following marine engineering firms “1. _Sea2Sea_”, “2. _Cargocare Asia_”, “3. _Macgrego_r”, “4. _Nufoss_” and “5. _AEG_”. _Hankook’s_ bid was not found in any part of the document.

49     The event timeline set out earlier will show that in mid-April 2015, the accused had persistently asked Mr Chee to send reminders to Mr Quek Shian Pin (PW 5) the Project Manager of Hull 389, to obtain his indorsement of the Bid Analysis Table (which showed Union Marine’s quotation of $ 2 541 000 as the recommended bid). When the latter had been slow to “_green-light_” the recommendation, Mr Low had called for a direct meeting and obtained Mr Quek’s signature on 24 April 2015. In short order too, Mr Low had taken the Bid Analysis Table to both the Managing Director and the Executive Director and obtained their signatures during a General Meeting.

### Instances of post-selection preference alleged by PW2

50     After the signatures were obtained, Mr Low had asked Mr Chee to place the order with Union Marine. This was unusually done **_before_** the owners of Hull 389 had closed their last comment. Mr Chee had recalled drafting the contract between _Keppel Singmarine_ and Union Marine, with instructions to remove **_standard_** clauses for bank guarantees for the first 20% down payment and a retention of the last 5% for commissioning[^39]. Mr Chee and PW3, Quincy Cheah had been uneasy with this deviation and had asked the accused to reconsider, arguing that _Keppel Singmarine’s_ interests would be unprotected in the event of default. Mr Low eventually only agreed with the restoration of the standard bank guarantee for the final five percent of payment.

### Alleged application of pressure by accused to support the Union Marine bid

51     It was PW2’s evidence that Mr Low had applied a considerable degree of pressure to push through the transaction. Mr Chee had written[^40] that “(Mr Low) _continued to press me on the order placement_ (for Union Marine) _and he claim that_ **_he is judging my capability_** _basing on how long I require from the date_” for a signatory to the Bid Analysis Table to agree to append his signature on the document. Before he directed Mr Chee to remove _Hankook’s_ bid from the Bid Table on the basis that Hankook was ”_not qualified to design_” and to avoid confusing with a bid that was not “_apple to apple_” , the accused had also disparagingly questioned Mr Chee’s impression of _Hankook’s_ competence when the two met, uttering “_what makes_ (Mr Chee) _think that Hankook’s proposal can be fitted into the ship_”.[^41] The witness could recall Mr Low using a voice that “_wasn’t…a nice tone, it’s more on the authority figure tone_”[^42]

52     Seemingly sensing the dissention his decision had caused within the procurement team, Mr Low had continued to engage with PW2 and PW3 in the aftermath of the award of the contract to Union Marine. This is expressed by Mr Chee in his letter to CPIB:

> Someday between 21 May to 27 May on my yearly appraisal period, (_Mr Low_) **_has confronted me and_** (_PW3_) **_Quincy_** (_Cheah_) together in his office and talked about the Moon pool purchase and he further elaborate on the reasons to purchase from Union Marine and the out of norm payment terms **_knowing that we are feeling uneasy on this purchase_**. **_After that confrontation, Patrick re-graded my yearly performance_**.

> \[Emphasis added\]

53     Mr Chee recalled that Mr Low had spoken in a very “_authoritative_” tone, and it was “_not a smooth conversation_”.[^43] While not clarified on the spot, context this seems to suggest that he meant ‘_authoritarian_’.[^44] He had also suffered an adverse re-grading of his performance appraisal, where Mr Low, his reporting officer, had seen fit to downgrade Mr Chee’s key performance indicator (KPI) score for monitoring of delivery from “_eight or nine points_” to six points.

## Sequalae _post_ the award of contract to Union Marine

### PW2’s messages in response to a ‘whistle-blower’s’ exposure of alleged misconduct in the moon pool procurement exercise

54     The next significant episode was the receipt by _Keppel Singmarine’s_ Group Internal Audit (GIA) department of a ‘whistle-blower’ communication asserting improprieties in the conduct of the moon pool acquisition, and where the writer had identified himself as PW2; Lawrence Chee. Mr Chee had recalled that the confrontation in late May 2015 had left PW3, Mr Cheah and himself with grave reservations about the propriety of Mr Low’s actions both in essentially securing the contract for Union Marine by excluding _Hankook’s_ ostensibly superior bid and also in his subsequent granting of preferential terms to the former company. The final crystallising development for the case began with Mr Chee on “_some day on July_” 2015, he had received an email from a General Manager of _Keppel Singmarine’s_ Group Internal Audit, and he was told that “_a letter that_ (Mr Chee had) _sent was well received”[^45]_ and that the department wished to obtain more details on the surrounding circumstances connected to Union Marine’s supply of the moon pool covers.

55     This had prompted Mr Chee to deny that he had penned this communication to the GIA. The actual date of the ‘whistle-blower’s’ letter is not on record, and the letter was not exhibited for these proceedings. The areas of interest would be Mr Chee’s initial response to the allegations of wrongdoing, and his subsequent explanation for this first response. In this regard he had responded to one Choo Tze Keong from GIA on 23 July 2015, and again 5 August 2015, essentially **_defending_** the selection of Union Marine despite Hankook’s ostensibly better bid. The significance of Mr Chee’s actions in this regard would be two-fold, the first is on the credibility of Mr Chee himself, given that the e-mails had been defensive of Mr Low’s decision to set aside the _Hankook_ bid from the Bid Analysis Table, with a number of justificatory reasons proffered, which of course differed considerably from his position at trial. The second aspect is in relation to Mr Chee’s revelation at trial that he had consulted Mr Low, and framed his responses **_according to Mr Low’s instructions_**.[^46]

56     In the first email on 23 July 2015, there had been some attempt to justify excluding _Hankook_, where Mr Chee had stated that it was incumbent on the purchasing department to perform due diligence to analyse “_every vendor's capability to supply the equipment in order not to jeopardize_” the project. The email also cast doubt on the acceptability of _Hankook’s_ bid to vessel owners:

> Usually owner will also go to the company website to review before accepting our proposal.

> Without being stated in maker list and supporting information in their corporate website, it will be an uphill task for owner to accept _Hankook_. Owner may (_sic_) false impression on (_Keppel Singmarine’s_) capability on selecting the right vendor. In my opinion, it is already difficult enough for Hankook to provide just a decent quote, (roughly 2 months) it may jeopardize the Project even more if we requires (_sic_) an even more detailed engineering design should we manage to award the order to them.

57     For the subsequent email on 5 August 2015, Mr Chee had begun by denying that he had been the “whistle-blower”:

> Dear Tze Keong,

> For the past few weeks I’ve been kept thinking of this whole incident and unable to focus on my work. I felt unease if I remain silent on this issue as someone is using my name to make a false accusations. I’m an upright person. Similarly, if I would suspect anyone wrongdoing, I would definitely standup and blow the whistle. However in this case the person who did this does not have ground for his/her action. He/she is doing (_sic_) "assumptions" to the things which he/he did not know…

58     For the substantive part of the text itself, the stance taken in the email appeared to be a defence of Mr Low’s decision to exclude _Hankook_ with an emphasis of the need for competence of the selected company, and the need to weed out non-viable quotes, because of the urgency to make a selection upon the exigencies of the quick turnabout time for the engineering review:

> Due to critical info required by our engineering, **_we are narrowing down the field by determining which suppliers are responsive and had the capability on providing the solution for the vessel_**, the latter (_Union Marine_) was preferred so as not to jeopardize project schedule. Thus I don't see any wrongdoing for making critical decision at critical time.

59     Another reason cited in the email was the possibility of conveying a “_wrong impression”_ and the reiteration of the now familiar phrase that an “_apple to apple_” comparison was vital. I should add that an abbreviated version of the email message to Group Internal Audit’s Choo Tze Keong, which was sent at 2.48 pm on 5 August 2015[^47] was sent to _Keppel Singmarine’s_ Executive Director Toh Ko Lin at 4.35 on the same day. Both contained the following passage protesting their[^48] intent was to ensure that panel members making a decision using the Bid Analysis Table, not be somehow misled by _Hankook’s_ bid.

> …(T)he reasons of failure in mentioning Hankook in the bid analysis is because the 1st quote submitted was not valid, **_we do not want to give the wrong impression to Management on the price indication. It has to be apple to apple comparison_**…

60     Subsequent witnesses in the prosecution’s case, particularly the very same _Keppel Singmarine_ executives that the Bid Analysis Table had been prepared for, would reiterate that these premises or concerns were fallacious, as the principal responsibility of the procurement team was to faithfully curate and present **_all_** priced quotations for a holistic comparison by the panel reviewing the Bid Analysis Table.

### PW2’s disavowal of responses in emails of 23 July 2015 and 5 August 2015

61     As indicated above, Mr Chee had claimed that the responses to the Group General Audit department (and email to Mr Toh Ko Lin) in the wake of the ‘_whistle-blower’s_’ letter had been essentially dictated to him by Mr Low. PW2 indicated that his primary objective in crafting the response was to reiterate that he “_did not send any whistleblowing emails or letter to the group auditors_” of _Keppel Singmarine_ despite being cited as the author in the message, but had found himself constrained to frame responses dictated to him by the accused after he sought Mr Low’s assistance “_for help to answer on the doubts in this requisition purchase_”[^49]

62     Mr Chee categorically disagreed with the assertion in the email that the purchasing department had been “more than fair to _Hankook_” in the bid gathering process. He explained that[^50]:

> This statement actually, **_I have consulted with_** (Mr Low) **_to draft accordingly to how are going to paint the picture_** to the auditors that, the requisition was treated fairly, Your Honour.

> \[Emphasis added\]

### PW2’s account of how the emails were vetted and edited by the accused

63     At trial, PW2 signalled his strong disagreement with the views expressed in the 5 August 2015 emails. This was especially in respect of the assertion that the exclusion of _Hankook’s_ bid ought be done to prevent the giving of a “_wrong impression to management on the price indicated_”, as an “_apple to apple comparison_” was needed. Mr Chee added that he had merely created a draft e-mail of the sequence of events and then consulted with Mr Low with the printed draft, and at the latter’s office, where Mr Low would “_discuss_” with PW2 on how he would “_input those necessary statements that to further justify on the purchase_”[^51] Mr Chee added that Mr Low had made handwritten amendments on the draft “_as well as_ **_additional wordings_** _that_… (he) _would need to put in…before_ (his) _reply to the_ (Group Internal Audit department) _and email_ (to Executive Director Toh Ko Lin) _directly_”.[^52]

## Evidence of PW3 Cheah Ka-Yip Quincy

64     Cheah Ka-Yip Quincy (“Mr Quincy Cheah” or “Mr Cheah”) was the second in command, as purchasing manager, at the purchasing department after Mr Low, having joined _Keppel Singmarine_ in 2007 even before the accused. Mr Cheah had left _Keppel Singmarine_ to join Singapore Telecommunications United (Singtel) in 2016 . Much of Mr Cheah’s court testimony traversed the same ground that Mr Chee did, and hence only the most critical parts of PW3’s testimony will be set out in these grounds.

65     As an officer who exceeded Mr Chee in seniority and also the only other individual in the purchasing department who had dealt with the accused at length at the material time, Mr Cheah was able to set out the contextual background on the circumstances surrounding the appointment of Union Marine to supply the moon pool hatches for the Hull 389 project. Mr Cheah stressed that the Bid Analysis Table ought list all the vendor companies that had received invitations to quote. It was necessary to those who did not respond or those whose quotations did not fulfil _Keppel Singmarine’s_ engineering requirements to also be included, as there had been a direction from the leadership of _Keppel Singmarine_ to have access to all available information on the field of bidders. This was a firm direction, and it would be useful to set out his response for a full appreciation of the context upon which his responses were given[^53]:

> Q    Alright. Let’s take a scenario where you have invited ten vendors to quote, alright. If only six vendors have responded with their quote, so four did not respond, would you put the information in this table?

> A    Yes.

> Q    Why would you do that?

> A    Because **_it will show the whole picture_** _o_f why the other four didn’t quote.

> Q    Why is it important to have the whole picture?

> A    Mmm, **_because the bosses want to know if how many vendors we have invited_**, and, um, **_out of this six, four didn’t quote. So, it is important to let the bosses know that_**.

> Q    Going on the same example, so you have six vendors who have quoted, **_would you put all of their quotes in this table_**?

> A    Yes, I will put.

> Q     **_What if any one of those quotes did not pass the technical engineering test or requirements_**.

> A     **_Yes, I will still put them_**.

> Q    Why?

> A    Because I need to let the bosses know why they are not selected.

> Q    Is there any reason to exclude any vendor from the bid-analysis-table?

> A    No.

> Q    Do you know if you’re allowed to exclude any vendor?

> A     **_We are not allowed, generally_**, but there is no ( _quality policy_ ) on this.

> \[Emphasis added\]

66     In this regard, it was Mr Cheah’s evidence even in the absence of a specific stipulation in a quality policy, it was the ‘_norm_’ for all quotes to be incorporated into the Bid Analysis Table, and that PW2; Lawrence Chee had properly fulfilled this directive by having included _Hankook’s_ quotation when he presented the Bid Analysis Table. In relation to the selection of the winning bid, Mr Cheah stressed that two criteria were paramount, In his words : “Usually they (_Keppel Singmarine_ decision-makers) look for the pricing, and whether it meets the minimum engineering requirements.”[^54]. He added that this invariably meant that the lowest bid would secure the job, as he had never encountered “any time whereby (_Keppel Singmarine_) bosses said, ‘_Let’s go for a more expensive one_.’”[^55] in his eight years there.

### PW3’s reaction when he saw the Bid Analysis Table for the first time

67     In a curious twist to the contention in Mr Chee’s emails to the Group Internal Audit department and Executive Director Toh Ko Lin on 5 August 2015 (where he asserted the content to have been substantially dictated by the accused) about **_Hankook_** being an unsuitable candidate for the moon pool cover project, it was PW3’s impression that **_Union Marine_** was an inappropriate choice for the project. Essential Mr Cheah doubted that Union Marine had sufficient experience in the installation of moon pool hatches, as their only prior business with _Keppel Singmarine_ had been in the installation of manual valves. In Mr Cheah’s own words during the examination-in-chief of his evidence with DPP Jasmin Kaur[^56]:

>   
| 

DPP:

 | 

And when you saw this bid-analysis-table, did you have any thoughts?

 |
| 

A

 | 

**_My thoughts were “Why was this awarded to Union Marine?”_**

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Why did you have that thought?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Because from my knowledge, **_Union Marine has only been supplying manual valves to Keppel Singmarine_**. And moon pool hatch cover was not on their list.

 |
| 

\[Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

### PW3’s disquiet over accused’s waiver of Union Marine’s obligation to provide a bank guarantee

68     After Union Marine had secured the deal to supply the moon pools hatches for Hull 389, Mr Quincy Cheah, upon being presented with a contract for his indorsement, had been particularly troubled upon noting a deviation of the contract. This was where a **_standard_** clause requiring Union Marine to take up a bank guarantee, formally referred to as a ‘refund bond payment’, to be taken out against the to the first tranche of payments of 20 percent of the contracted price for the supply of the moon pool hatches, had been struck off[^57]:

> The terms of payment shall be as follows:

> 1st Instalment Twenty percent (20%) of the PURCHASE PRICE shall be payable within 30 days after signing of the AGREEMENT. Subject to receipt of all the following documents:

>> a)    Original SUPPLIER'S invoice with itemizing the individual values.

>> ~b) A Refund Bond Payment for an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the PURCHASE PRICE issued by an international bank acceptable to the BUYER in the format as per Appendix III herein. -The bank guarantee shall expire after complete delivery of the SYSTEM to the yard.~

69     He had found this disturbing as it was “unusual for _Keppel Singmarine_ to give a huge deposit without a bank guarantee”[^58] and it was standard practice for payments out to supplying vendors be backed by a bank guarantee. He had never recalled a similar situation before as the bank guarantee was a mandated failsafe “_in case the supplier runs away”_ with the deposit.[^59]. Mr Cheah had been so concerned that he had asked Mr Chee to “_push-back this term and get a 10% bank guarantee from the supplier_”. By this he meant that the term was unacceptable, and that it was incumbent that Union Marine be made to accede to the provision of a bank guarantee on their part, as a condition to receiving the first 20 percent tranche of the contracted sum.

70     PW3 Quincy Cheah recalled that Mr Chee had only reverted days later to say that he had only succeeded in securing a guarantee against the fifth and **_final_** payment, involving five percent of the contracted price. Mr Cheah’s concerns were unassuaged as this meant that the first payment was essentially unprotected against any default by Union Marine. He had finally indorsed stating that he “_reluctantly accepted it_” but maintained that he was “_in disagreement_ (that the contract with Union Marine) _should be without a bank guarantee for the first payment_”. His grudging acceptance being predicated by a sense that there was nothing he could have done to change the situation[^60]

### PW3’s suspicions against the accused and their subsequent confrontation

71     Mr Cheah recalled the relationship between Mr Low and his two subordinates; Mr Chee and himself, taking a turn for the worse after he had signed the contract with the mental reservations stated above. Union Marine’s Raymond Tay had thereafter asked for a face-to-face meeting. The meeting had involved Mr Low, Mr Raymond Tay and Mr Chee, in the accused’s room. Mr Cheah could overhear the conversation from, his adjoining room, and noted that discussion appeared to centre on Mr Chee “_having to push the Keppel Singmarine engineering team”_ to provide drawings for Union Marine’s benefit[^61]. While Mr Cheah could not recall all the details of the discussion, which was still “_quite loud_” from his vantage point, he remembered the “gist” being Mr Low telling Mr Chee “_that he should be chasing our own Keppel Singmarine engineering team to provide details and drawings to Union Marine_”.

### Basis for PW3 to tell PW2 to monitor the accused’s movements

72     Mr Cheah was clear that the contract had already been awarded to Union Marine, and it was “_not a norm_” for the purchasing department to assume a continued responsibility to “_chase_” the Engineering department for drawings to aid the successful bidder. Mr Cheah was concerned, and he had, on the next day, checked with Mr Chee, who confirmed that this had been indeed Mr Low’s specific direction. Mr Cheah had been so concerned that he had asked Mr Chee to “_monitor_ (Mr Low’s) _movements_” as the accused’s actions in continuing to aid Union Marine had struck the former as being “_a bit fishy_”.[^62] He recalled his discussion with Mr Chee to have occurred on a Saturday.

### Confrontation between the accused and PW2 and PW3

73     Mr Cheah’s suggestion to Mr Chee to monitor Mr Low’s movements had been the precursor to a confrontation on the following Monday when he and Mr Chee had been called to Mr Low’s office. Mr Cheah recalled that Mr Low had started the session asking the two “_Why do you think we awarded this to Union Marine instead of Hankook?_”. According to PW3, the accused had thereafter extolled Union Marine’s 12 years of experience in the marine engineering industry while debunking _Hankook_ as a company he had “_never heard of before”[^63]_. When asked by DPP Jasmin Kaur if he knew why Mr Low was explaining this to him, Mr Cheah responded “_My hunch is because of my suspicions why Hankook was not included in the bid-analysis_” Mr Cheah added that Mr Low “_sounded very condescending_”[^64] and he had felt being “_talked-down_” to. He remembered that he hardly spoke merely nodded his head.

### Asserted offence taken over PW3’s suggestion to PW2 for the monitoring of the accused’s movements

74     On why Mr Low had taken such a tone at the confrontation, Mr Cheah believed that Mr Low had taken umbrage over his remark to Mr Chee to monitor the former’s movements and might have overheard Mr Chee retorting “_What do you mean by monitoring his movements_?”[^65] when he had first proposed the notion of following the accused to latter. Mr Cheah also believed that he had ‘telegraphed’ his uneasiness in the award of the contract to Union Marine by his pushing back on the refund bond terms, where he had been demonstrably reticent in indorsing the contract in the absence of the standard guarantees against monies paid to the supplying vendor, which was of course Union Marine in this instance.

### PW3’s differing view of Hankook’s standing with Keppel Singmarine and perceived ability to fulfil the moon pool contract

75     Mr Cheah did not share the accused’s apparent bleak appraisal of _Hankook_ where the latter had asserted at that confrontation that _Hankook_ was a brand or company unknown to him. He had a favourable opinion of the company and recalled prior dealings with _Hankook_, where _Keppel Singmarine_ had bought equipment from _Hankook_ and paid a deposit toward the purchase. The client in that case had cancelled the vessel. He recalled that _Keppel Singmarine_ had reached an understanding with Executive Director Toh Koh Lin and agreed to **_hold on_** to a deposit _Keppel Singmarine_ had placed, rather than **_forfeit_** the sum upon the cancellation of the vessel, and consequent discontinuance of the project. The arrangement would allow for the retained sum to be set-off for future purchases with _Hankook_ upon the company’s successful bid for projects run by _Keppel Singmarine_. PW3 had thus concluded that “_So, my recollection of Hankook is they are reliable_.” [^66] When pressed by the learned DPP to explain his conclusion, Mr Cheah had stated[^67]:

> Q    I’m sorry. Can you explain to us how this example shows Hankook is reliable?

> A    Because most suppliers would have forfeited the deposit especially if the order is cancelled, but Hankook did not. **_They wish to build a long tern relationship with_** (_Keppel_) **_Singmarine._**

> \[Emphasis added\]

76     It should be noted that _Keppel Singmarine’s_ Executive Director Toh Ko Lin had predeceased the earliest date of Mr Low’s trial, and thus unfortunately could not be a witness to the proceedings. Mr Cheah completed his evidence stating that he had no prior dealings with Union Marine. I should add that notwithstanding the reported differences he had with the accused and their difficult working relationship, I had no doubt that PW3, who no longer worked with _Keppel Singmarine_, was a forthright and objective witness of fact. What was notable was the fact that PW3 Quincy Cheah’s evidence cohered closely with that of PW2; Lawrence Chee, despite the fact that both had left _Keppel Singmarine_ in 2016 (Mr Chee had joined a rival telecommunications company ‘M1’ that year). While he could not remember the exact dates, Mr Cheah’s recollection of the events of mid-2015 when he gave his evidence some five years later in February 2020 was still clear and closely matched the account rendered by his erstwhile colleague, especially in relation to the confrontation.

### Question whether PW3 was the ‘whistle-blower’

77     I should add that Mr Chee had testified as to his suspicion[^68] that Mr Cheah had been the ‘_whistle-blower_’ who had written the letter to _Keppel Singmarine’s_ Group Internal Audit department, and used his (Mr Chee’s) name. He had deduced by elimination, as the letter had been sent in July 2015 after the confrontation in late May 2015, and there had just been just three persons with inside knowledge of how Union Marine had secured the bid to supply the moon pool covers. Mr Chee had excluded himself, and did not believe Mr Low would have incriminated himself, and this thus left Mr Quincy Cheah as the remaining individual who was _au fait_ with the circumstances. This was not specifically suggested or put to Mr Cheah by either side when he gave his evidence at trial. Nevertheless, while the ‘w_histle-blower’s_’ letter triggered a cascade of events which eventually led to Mr Low being charged and prosecuted, the actual **_identity_** of the ‘_whistle-blower_’ remained a matter of tangential interest which was not critical to either the prosecution or defence case.

## Testimonies of Keppel Singmarine’s key personnel and decision-makers

### Evidence of PW 4 Poon Tai Lum, PW 5 Quek Shian Pin and PW 8 Abu Bakar bin Mohd Nor

78     The testimonies of the three _Keppel Singmarine_ executives can be taken together in this part, given the substantial commonality and overlap of areas of coverage of their testimonies, which essentially centred on the protocols governing the analysis of quotations, and the manner that the Bid Analysis Table was presented to them by the accused or his subordinates from the purchasing department.

79      **PW 8, Mr Abu Bakar bin Mohd Nor** (“Mr Abu Bakar”), had been _Keppel Singmarine’s_ Managing Director at the material time, and was the final signatory for the Bid Analysis Table. Mr Abu Bakar’s evidence was that a Bid Analysis Table operated as a veritable dashboard to allow easy access to all salient information on the project for the decision-makers. The inclusion of all invited parties was for the purpose of being able form a full picture in this decision-making process. Thus, information that should have been incorporated ought have included the listing of vendors who were invited to bid, but declined to quote. Mr Abu Bakar indicated that even quotations that had been marked for rejection or as non-preferred on the basis of engineering issues, had to be included in the Bid Analysis Table.

### Accused’s claim to PW8 that there were only two available vendors for the supply of moon pool hatches

80     It was Mr Abu Bakar’s evidence that there should ordinarily be a minimum[^69] of three quotations in the Bid Analysis Table for _Keppel Singmarine’s_ management to review. He added that any deviation had to be specifically justified and explained to him, as it was “_not normal to have two_ (bids), _unless they have specific reasons_”.[^70] The witness recalled that Mr Low had brought him the Bid Analysis Table which had contained only **_two_** full quotations, with a recommendation for Union Marine to be selected. As a matter of habit Mr Abu Bakar would ordinarily raise a query in relation any discernible an anomaly as there being only two quotes but could not recall what he had asked Mr Low on that occasion as ‘_quite some time_’ had elapsed between the time he spoke to Mr Low and the day he was offering his oral testimony.[^71]In his words, PW8 recalled that in response, Mr Low “_was informing me that the other five_ (were unable) _to quote and, only Union Marine and TTS are able to quote_”.[^72] Mr Abu Bakar thus averred that Mr Low had sought to explain that there **_had only been two vendors_**, Union Marine and TTS, that had been able to quote, and that five other vendors who were invited not been in a position to provide quotations.

81     After green-lighting Union Marine for the supply, Mr Abu Bakar had only come into knowledge that _Hankook_ had indeed tendered a full quote when problems had developed in the project undertaken by Union Marine in relation to the operability of the hatch covers. _Keppel Singmarine_ had been “_looking around for options_”[^73] to remedy the issues when he realised that _Hankook_ had indeed given a prior quote. Mr Abu Bakar indicated that _Hankook’s_ services were subsequently resorted to when their problems with Union Marine’s performance of the contract became intractable[^74].

82     Mr Abu Bakar, who had commissioned an internal investigation when he became aware of a missing quote, realised that _Hankook’s_ finalised quote had been dated 17 March 2015, which was well before the Bid Analysis Table was drawn up (on 9 April 2015) and more than a month before the Bid Analysis Table was to be formally considered in late April 2015. The investigation had been overseen by their parent, the Keppel Offshore Marine Group, and the managed by Mr Abu Bakar to ensure that the investigation are “_fully carried out in proper order_ (and) _a fair manner_”. The probe had eventuated in Mr Low’s termination from _Keppel Singmarine_.

### PW8’s testimony that there was no basis to exclude Hankook’s bid

83     In relation to Mr Low’s claim that there were valid grounds to exclude the _Hankook_ bid, Mr Abu Bakar opined that the accused’s position was not tenable in the light of _Keppel Singmarine’s_ prevailing policies for the submission of quotations, and particularly with _Hankook_ having by that time submitted a final technically detailed and priced quote for the Hull 389 project. The substance of _Hankook’s_ proposal[^75](which Mr Abu Bakar had attested to be completely oblivious to at the time the Bid Analysis Table was submitted to him) were sufficient and it ought to have properly constituted the third quote.

84     Mr Abu Bakar put it rather bluntly that “**_If I knew about P8_** (the _Hankook_ quotation) I **_would not have signed P2_** (the Bid Analysis Table)”[^76] The exclusion of _Hankook’s_ quote was especially anomalous considering that both TTS Marine’s and Union Marine’s quotes exceeded the budget of $2 235 000, with an excess of $306 000 being required to meet Union Marine’s quote of $2 541 000. _Hankook’s_ quote in P8, for the equivalent number of moon pool hatches and HPU units, of just $ 1 650 000, fell well within the budget. Mr Abu Bakar thus stressed “(L)_ooking at the price offered by Hankook, it is worth to be considered for review whether they… are able to deliver_”[^77] Another anomaly that Mr Abu Bakar noted while perusing the contract that _Keppel Singmarine_ had entered with Union Marine contract was that the clause requirement for the vendor to take up what he referred to as a “_refund bond_”[^78] against the first disbursement of 20 percent of the contract price had been struck out. He noted that the purpose of the refund bond was to protect _Keppel Singmarine’s_ interests to ensure that contractors performed their stipulated role, otherwise, they would be vulnerable to a situation where “_your contractors can just walk off_… _after collecting your payment_”.[^79]

### Evidence of PW4 Poon Tan Lum

85     PW4, Poon Tai Lum (“Mr Poon”) was the General Manager (Commercial) of _Keppel Singmarine_, Mr Poon had completed a 40-year career in _Keppel Singmarine_ before retiring a year before the date of his testimony, and thus has vast experience in the procurement process. He described his role in ascertaining the wishes and needs of the owners of the vessels, and then working on the acquisition of needed component through a bidding process to engage subcontractors for the supply of these component, such as the moon pool hatches in this instance. The position taken by Mr Abu Bakar was also reflected in Mr Poon’s testimony, who had also stated that he was unaware of _Hankook’s_ quotation, and whose position was that **_all quotations_** received ought be reflected in the Bid Analysis Table. Mr Poon was clear that he would **_not_** have signed off on P2[^80] if he had known that P8, which was from his examination[^81] in court, a valid quote, on the premise that the specs should also have been sent for a prior engineering review (which was never done or directed to be done by the accused).

### Vendors were permitted to re-quote if original bid and problems and these were published on the Bid Analysis Table

86     In this regard, Mr Poon indicated that all responses which were deemed to be bids to secure the job had to be sent for an engineering review through Mr Low’s purchasing department. He expected that some suppliers might encounter problems at the engineering review. These vendors would be invited to requote[^82] if their quotations were deemed by the Engineering department to have fallen short of specifications. These re-quoted bids remained eligible for consideration. Where any invited party declined to quote, or eschewed from re-quoting, these would **_still_** be listed in the Bid Analysis Table with annotations indicating positions such as their disinclination to quote, or that their original quote (being the only quote on record) did not conform with technical specifications.

87     At cross-examination, when counsel asked if the first submission by _Hankook_ on 15 February 2015[^83] was too generic in specifications to be useful as a quote, Mr Poon noted that drawings had been attached and some details provided.[^84] It would have been incumbent on Mr Low’s purchasing department to send the document to the Engineering department to allow their review. Mr Poon’s view was that the submission of quotations from relatively new vendors often began from a preliminary base, and the purchasing department was expected to co-ordinate with the Engineering department to develop the final specifications.[^85] There was thus an expectation that bids would be given time for refinement.

### Hankook was better known to PW4 than Union Marine

88     Mr Poon stated that _Hankook_ was known to him, and that the company was involved a wide array of activities, which included maintaining a training house, as well as fabrication and supply of equipment relevant to the industry. In his own words, _Hankook_ was involved in “_all sorts of thing_(s)”[^86] in the field of marine engineering and he regarded them as “_normal vendors_”. On the other hand, Mr Poon did not have any clear impression of Union Marine and had never dealt with the company. His knowledge of the company was limited to knowing that the ‘boss’ was a man called “_Raymond_”. Considering that Mr Poon had been a veteran of 40 years in the industry, this belied the accused’s claim to his subordinates; Mr Lawrence Chee and Mr Quincy Cheah, that he had a valid basis to reject _Hankook’s_ bid as the company was an unknown quality.

### Evidence of PW5 Quek Shian Pin

89     PW5 Mr Quek Shian Pin, the Project Manager for the H389 vessel project stated himself to be unaware of Hankook’s bid when he had signed off on Union Marine’s quotation. According to the witness, he had severe reservations, but had been persuaded to sign after being convinced by the accused that he should do so as even Mr Toh Ko Lin had signed off on the Bid Analysis Table favouring the recommendation of Union Marine. Mr Quek explained that as Project Manager, he was tasked to deliver the project according to the defined specifications and within the set schedule.

### The Bid Analysis Table was the only common document used by various departments and leadership team of Keppel Singmarine

90     Mr Quek, who had left _Keppel Singmarine_ for Tat Hin Timber Pte Ltd by the time of his testimony, took the same stance as the previous signatories for **_all_** quotations to be incorporated into the Bid Analysis Table, and that even ‘_non-compliant_’ bids should have been included.[^87] Mr Quek added that the Bid Analysis Table was the **_single_** document consulted by the various stakeholders, being those from procurement (Mr Low), commercial (PW4, Mr Poon), engineering (PW 6, Mr Chinna) and himself as the Project Manager, with the final two signatories would be the Executive Director (Mr Toh Ko Lin) and Managing Director (PW8, Mr Abu Bakar).[^88]

### PW5 was convinced to accept Union Marine’s bid after being told by accused that Keppel Singmarine’s Executive Director had already done so

91     Mr Quek indicated that he had been under pressure to ‘green-light’ Union Marine’s bid by Mr Chee, who was apparently acting under the accused’s instructions as early as 6 April 2015[^89]. This had been followed through by a series of reminders to him, with an increased level of stridency from “_Kindly give green light..._” on 6 April 2015 “Please _give green light to place order ASAP_” on 17 April 2015. Mr Quek still had unresolved doubts as the Union Marine bid of $2 541 000 was $306 000 above the assigned budget of $ 2 2365 000. [^90] He didn’t “_feel comfortable_” about this proposal as he felt accountable to the vessel owners and had to properly justify any increase from the projected price for the moon pool hatches.

92     To this end, Mr Quek had sought a number of clarifications on the technical specifications on the _Parosha_ system that Union Marine had proposed to instal on Hull 389. Ultimately, he had been called to attend personally at Mr Low’s office on 24 April 2015. He had then been assured by Mr Low of Mr Toh’s prior approval of the bid. This had influenced him to sign the Bid Analysis Table. The following shows his response when questioned by DPP Jasmin Kaur:

>   
| 

DPP:

 | 

So, what exactly did (_Mr Low_) tell you during this discussion about this particular project?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Not the exact words but, uh, it’s something like **_Mr. Toh, has already approved_**.

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

Q

 | 

What were you supposed to do upon learning that Mr. Toh had apparently already approved?

 |
| 

A

 | 

To proceed with the purchase.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And why is your approval important?

 |
| 

A

 | 

In… the bid-analysis, uh, everybody has to sign on the further purchase to proceed.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, if I understand you correctly, you are saying that you signed because you were told that Mr. Toh had already approved the procurement?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |

  
  

### The Bid Analysis Table has always remained open to accept viable late bids, and especially if existing bids are over the budget

93     Mr Quek indicated that there was no hard timeline where bids would be cut off from consideration. This was particularly so in this case when the existing bids were unsatisfactory. At cross-examination, defence counsel had sought to show that for the Bid Analysis Table, _Keppel Singmarine_ GM Poon had already indorsed the document, which had been signed by the accused on 9 April 2015, the date of its preparation. He had asked if this would inhibit further entries of bids after the former date[^91]:

>   
| 

DC:

 | 

Mr. Poon Tai Lum endorsed that box on the 14th of April 2015. So, my question to you is this, my client signed on 9th of April 2015, what if a bid came in after he signed?

 |
| 

PW5

 | 

**_This still doesn’t affect anything, in the end, we can at most, just re-prepare the bid analysis_**.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

“Re-prepare”.

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yah.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, your evidence is if a bid comes in after 9th of April, the bid-analysis-table has to be redrafted. Is that your evidence?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

**_Now, how about after the 14th of April_**?

 |
| 

A

 | 

**_As long as the bid needs to be considered, the whole thing has to be redrafted. Yes_**.

 |

  
  

94     Mr Quek made it clear that it was possible to re-draft the Bid Analysis Table even **_after_** _Keppel Singmarine’s_ Executive Director Toh Ko Lin had signed P2 on 24 April 2015. It was Mr Quek’s responsibility as the Project Manager to make the judgment call on this possible course of action, basing this on essential criterion as whether the posted bids were already satisfactory. In the instant case, he had been concerned that both bids tendered by TTS Marine and Union Marine were above budget. Given this, it would have been appropriate to entertain the notion of a third bid. This would have applied even if the bid had had come in late, or had only been revealed after all signatories had appended their signatures on the Bid Analysis Table:[^92]

>   
| 

DC

 | 

…**_Now, my question to you is, what if a bid came in on … 25th of April 2015 and all the signatures have already been appended on the bid-analysis-table. What are we going to do with that bid? What are we going to do with that quote?_**

 |
| 

A

 | 

**_If it’s_** **_this_** **_bid, we will redo the whole bid analysis_**.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, if it comes in on the 25th, you must redo.

 |
| 

A

 | 

**_No._** **_If it’s this particular one_** **_, … which is acceptable in the project’s budget, yes, it has to be reconsidered_**.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, even if all the signatures on the bid-analysis-table,--

 |
| 

A

 |

### Evidence of PW 6 Gnanapra Kasam Chinnadurai

95     PW6; Gnanapra Kasam Chinnadurai (“Mr Chinna”) from _Keppel Singmarine’s_ Engineering department, was yet another party from whom the accused required a signature for the Bid Assessment Table. Mr Chinna had joined _Keppel Singmarine’s_ Engineering department in 2003, and was, at the time of his testimony, with Keppel FELS Ltd, after a merger, in 2017. He had risen from a draftsman to an assistant manager of the engineering and steel outfits section in the Engineering department at the material time. Mr Chinna had signed the Bid analysis Table on a date between 9 April 2015 and 15 April 2015.[^93] He added that the Engineering department would generally sign the Table after Mr Low’s Purchasing and Analysis (P&A) department had first done so. The more salient aspect of Mr Chinna’s evidence was his account of how the accused had had also **_pressured_** him to close the comments sheet for Union Marine’s bid, despite the former finding mistakes in the quotation, as well as his raising the point that Union Marine had failed to tender the requisite preliminary drawings.

### Inadequate information and absence of general arrangement drawings in the Union Marine proposal

96     When Mr Chinna had been handed Union Marine’s proposal[^94], members of his department had noted some inadequacies in the submission, and had thus made “_some mechanical comments_”[^95] raising queries to the dimensions of the product to be supplied, as well as the type of the cover. Mr Chinna himself had also noted the absence of preliminary drawings, observing that only “_some pictures_” of the _Parosha_ system were incorporated with the quotation. Mr Chinna indicated that the generic diagrams were inadequate and customised preliminary drawings were important. Where these were available, he would be in a position to “_a preliminary check with the ship structures_”. He had asked for these drawings from Mr Low’s subordinate, Mr Lawrence Chee, but they were “_never put in_”.[^96] Overall Mr Chinna felt the drawings were incomplete.

### Accused justified Union Marine’s failure to produce GA drawings, even after Hankook had produced a set

97     Mr Chinna noted that other departments had also flagged issues with Union Marine’s proposal with Mr Shafiquzzaman from the MTD having asked for reference general arrangement (GA) drawings from Union Marine which were needed to develop a contingency plan for the moon pool design on 24 February 2015.[^97] Mr Low had responded directly to state “_As these moon pool_(s) _are custom made to suit our requirement, vendor_ (i.e. Union Marine) _will produce their AutoCAD drawing_ **_upon receiving our PO_** (purchase order)_. This is the reason why we chase to finalize the technical review in order for us to place order_.” Mr Chinna noted that Mr Shafiquzzaman had responded “_Vendor_ (i.e. Union Marine) _could give their existing design from some of their other project which is close fit_ **_like what we have received from Hankook_**.”

98     Essentially Mr Low’s position at this point was to have Union Marine confirmed **_first_** as the successful bidder before the company produced the requested GA drawings, and he was concurrently using this newly created condition as leverage to impose pressure on the Engineering department to expedite the technical review.

99     Considering the situation for a moment, the above email thread was effectively documented proof that _Hankook_ had, at this stage in late February 2015 (and prior to the accused’s purported rejection of their bid in March 2015) produced GA drawings (albeit seemingly adapted from a similar past project) that had passed muster with the MTD department, to the extent that Union Marine had been asked to **_follow_** _Hankook’s_ example in obtaining similar GA drawings for the MTD to work with. This rather ironical development belied the accused’s claim that _Hankook_ had been properly excluded on the basis of their failure to supply a proper quotation.

### PW5’s impression of Union Marine and Hankook, and experience of the latter

100    Also belying Mr Low’s assertion that Union Marine was a more established marine engineering company than _Hankook_ was the fact of Mr Chinna’s admission that he had taken a cautious stand in relation to his insistence for preliminary drawings as the moon pools were a “_quite major item_” and also with regard to Union Marine, Mr Chinna had indicated it was the “_first time_ (he was dealing) _with these vendors_” [^98] Mr Chinna was far more familiar with _Hankook_, having dealt with the marine engineering establishment “_several times in…previous projects_” and found that company “ _very supportive_” and also pointing out that “_they managed to complete_” all that they had been commissioned to do.[^99]

### The email from Marine Technology Division would have given accused notice that Hankook had been involved in similar projects

101    Looking again from a different perspective at the **_same_** text sent by Mr Shaffiquzzaman from _Keppel Singmarine’s_ MTD to Mr Low on 24 February 2015 that “_Vendor could give_ **_their existing design from some of their other project_** **_which is close fit like what_** **_we have received_** **_from Hankook_** “; the plain wording of the underlined portion of the text would have put the accused on notice that _Hankook_ had indeed been involved in a **_similar_** project in the past which was such a “_close fit_” with the current project that the drawing supplied were acceptable to the Marine Technology Department for the purpose of analysing the suitability of the proposal. Since the text was sent to Mr Low himself some three weeks before he ordered the removal of _Hankook_ from the Bid Analysis Table (to which he had duly responded to), this would further undermine his claim to be doubtful of _Hankook’s_ competence to see through the project, and that their bid was not a comparable “_apple to apple_” match with the bids by Union Marine and TTS Marine.

### PW6’s confrontation with the accused

102    According to PW6, his cautious stand with the Union Marine bid had drawn the ire of the accused and precipitated a verbal confrontation, where Mr Low had summoned Mr Chinna to his office, raised his voice and mounted accusation against Mr Chinna for ‘_causing delay’_. [^100] This had occurred after Union Marine had sent an updated quotation on 26 March 2015. Mr Chinna had replied with further queries the very next day, which Union Marine had, in turn, responded on 30 March 2015. The verbal altercation had occurred within that period, although Mr Chinna could not recall the specific date or time. Mr Chinna recalled that Mr Lawrence Chee had told him that Mr Low had wished to meet him. When they met Mr Low had queried “_why_ (Mr Chinna) _still keep commenting_ and _“why still never close comment_.”[^101]

103    Mr Chinna had sought to explain that there were still “_mistakes in the quotation_” and also that there was “_no preliminary drawing, just a picture only_”.[^102] Mr Low’s response, according to PW6 was that “_he promised that they will … provide more detailed drawing_ **_after_** _we sign contract_.”[^103]. Mr Low had thereafter redirected the topic to tell him that “engineering is dragging this and may be the cause of the delay” and that because of Mr Chinna himself “_the project is keep delaying_.”[^104] Mr Chinna recalled that Mr Low had raised his voice at him, and that because of the delays that he attributed directly to Mr Chinna, they “_cannot close the package now_.” Mr Low had urged Mr Chinna to expedite the process by reviewing the comment sheet and closing the comment quickly.[^105]

### PW6 constrained to close comments on Union Marine’s quotation despite unresolved issues

104    On his part, Mr Chinna had, throughout the exchange, sought to explain that he had taken the position as there had truly still been insufficient information from Union Marine to allow him to close his comments. Despite Union Marine having produced an ostensibly updated quotation on 26 March 2015, he regarded this document as essentially the same quotation[^106] with no new material that could quell his misgivings. Thus even if he were to close any comment on the earlier quotation from Union Marine, he would have been constrained to add an additional comment on the newly submitted question to request yet another update on the unresolved areas.[^107] Mr Chinna added that his concern had been principally obtaining proper drawings as the Engineering section was tasked with ‘_steel outfit_’ functions, and hence needed to know if the item was dimensionally suited to be fitted onto the vessel, Hull 389. Union Marine had merely enclosed generic close-up line illustrations of the system from _Parosha_, the Dutch company Union Marine proposed to use for the supply of the moon pools.

105    After Mr Chinna had returned to his department, he had debriefed his superiors and explained that he was being “_blamed_” for “_dragging the item_”,[^108] being the supply of moon pool hatches. He had explained that he had felt ‘_pressured_’ and this was the first time he had been called up for such a meeting. A decision was finally made, after their discussion, to close the comment, notwithstanding the pending unresolved issues. Mr Chinna had also gone on to sign on the Bid Analysis Table which had endorsed United Marine as the recommended bid despite his stated misgivings as did not want to be identified as the cause of any delay or of dragging the process[^109]. Mr Chinna had backed down, as he had accepted Mr Low’s promise that “_they would do everything_” and provide “_more drawings and more detailed drawings_”.

### PW 6 was never shown Hankook’s 17 March 2015 quotation

106    When asked by DPP Jasmin Kaur, Mr Chinna stated that he had not seen _Hankook’s_ final quotation, and that bids received by the procurement department would be forwarded to Engineering department only where a technical review was desired[^110]:

> Q    P8 is a proposal sent by Hankook on the 17th of March. Can I check with you if you had seen this document at that time?

> A     **_No._**

> Q    Who would this document be sent to, do you know? From Hankook, who do they send it to?

> A    Procurements.

> Q    And would procurement have to send it to engineering?

> A    They want us to review.

### The Engineering department’s technical reviews generally took three to five days

107    Mr Chinna also stated that the _Hankook_ proposal contained a greater level of “s_pecification_”. He noted that a reference drawing had been provided with salient technical details such as the working temperature of the moon pool. Overall, he opined that the Hankook quote contained “_more technical info compared to …the Union Marine quote_”.[^111] He added that, unlike the Union Marine bid, the later _Hankook_ quote[^112] had **_never_** been submitted for a technical review, which could have been completed in just three to five days.[^113] As the Engineering department was only concerned with ascertaining the technical suitability of items sought be supplied, Mr Chinna had not probed further, or pressed for the inclusion of _Hankook_, as it was not the Engineering department to advocate the selection of any vendor.

### Evidence of PW7 Nigel Koh Leong

108    Dr Nigel Koh was a senior design manager in _Keppel Singmarines’s_ Marine Technology Development at the material time. He had been involved in executing a basic design for marine engineering projects, before handing the case to the Engineering department for more detailed diagrams to be created. The ambit of Dr Koh’s basic design entailed coming up with the ship design in terms of structural design, mechanical schematics, and electrical schematics to meet the intended performance of the vessel. He was also responsible for engaging an independent classification society to approve the drawing Dr Koh confirmed that he had contacted his colleague Mr Shaffiquzzaman to contact TTS Marine, through the purchasing department to obtain technical information also the operation of the department.

109    In this instance, Dr Koh had sought to determine the dimension of the moon pool cover that TTS Marine had designed with an intent to undertake model basing for testing to ascertain the speed performance of the vessel in question. He had been concerned that a large opening on the hull might affect the speed performance of the vessel. This had attracted a response from the accused on 23 January 2015, where the latter had queried why he was engaging TTS Marine for moon pool cover joints, seeming to be aware that this was for the Hull 389 project. Dr Nigel Koh also noted Mr Low’s admonition “_not_ (to) _tie down to vendors into our design unless price, delivery and most importantly, contractual T&C is favour to (Keppel Singmarine_).” Dr Koh understood “_Tie down_” to mean “_locking_ (one)_self with their products or their design_. Dr Koh had averred that he had never intended to bind _Keppel Singmarine_ with any suppler of equipment but had merely sought to obtain information on moon pool covers, with “_no commitment to anybody_”[^114] Dr Koh indicated that this was the norm for shipbuilding at the nascent basic design phase.

### PW7 asked to review Union Marine’s proposal

110    Given Mr Low’s expressed conservative position, Dr Nigel Koh was surprised to receive on 16 February 2015 Union Marine’s proposal where the accused had stated in an email entitled “_H389 moon pool covers, Union Marine, Parosha_”:

> Hi Nigel, please use the attached technical proposal for your design work. There will be no preliminary drawing at this stage, reason because all these hatches are custom-made and the factory will only start the drawing when we place the order.

111    Dr Koh had been perturbed, as this seemed to be a complete about turn where Mr Low had admonished him in relation to his earlier attempt to engage TTS Marine on the premise that _Keppel Singmarine_ should not allow itself to be tied down to anybody. PW7 thus found it “_strange_”[^115] that he had then abrupt received the unpriced Union Marine proposal despite the accused’s own injunction to him to not be tied down to a specific vendor. He had then, acting in accordance with his role as a basic designer, taken the information Union Marine had provided, and used this as a foundation for basic design work for the moon pool and its emplacement in the vessel.

112    Dr Nigel Koh was then shown _Hankook’s_ proposal P8 and indicated that he had not seen the proposal at that point of point in 2015, and added that that he had not been made aware of this proposal[^116]. Having had the opportunity to examine the proposal when he was giving his evidence at trial, Dr Koh added that “_it_[^117]_has all the information of a decent proposal.”_[^118]_._ Dr Koh noted that the moon pool drawings were adapted from a past project Hankook had done. He noted that Hankook had provided the technical description of the hydraulic system that they are proposing, the plain scheme of the moon pool cover, as well as the material of the steels proposed for use.

### PW7’s prior experience with Hankook

113    Ultimately, the witness expressed his view that _Hankook’s_ bid was **_comparable_** with that proposed by Union Marine. Like the other key officers of _Keppel Singmarine_ who were posed the same query, Dr Koh knew _Hankook_ somewhat better than he did Union Marine. The witness revealed that he had, in his previous employment (prior to prior to joining _Keppel Singmarine_), at Singapore Technologies Marine been engaged in design work, with _Hankook_ to supply an elevator on board a vessel. In that instance, he noted that _Hankook_ had Korean links, and the company had been able to source a _Hyundai_ elevator, which he regarded as a good system for that project. Conversely, Dr Koh had not heard of Union Marine before the material time, and thus had no prior impression of the company. [^119]

## Evidence of Hankook representative

### Evidence of PW9 Li Yong Xing

114    PW9; Li Yong Xing (“Mr Li”) was the General manager at _Hankook_ at the material time having joined the company in 2004. He indicated that _Hankook’s_ primary business was the supply of marine equipment, and his functions encompassed all portions of the commercial operations of the company including the engineering aspects. Mr Li indicated that Hankook had extensive involvement with key shipyards in Singapore As the local presence of _Hankook_ had been an issue, with Mr Low stating that he was unfamiliar with _Hankook_ as a basis for excluding the company’s bid, it would be apposite to set out Mr Li’s evidence in this regard[^120]:

> Q    And how much business does Hankook do for the shipyard industry in Singapore?

> A    We do a lot of business including with the major companies such as Keppel Shipyard and …other SME as well. So, for the major companies include Jurong Shipyard, Keppel Shipyard, Keppel Marine. Sembawang Shipyard …and other SME companies as well.

115    In respect of the supply of moon pool hatch covers, he stated that the manufacture was undertaken by Hankook’s suppliers in Korea, adding that Hankook ‘_seldom received_” enquiries regarding moon pool covers but “_once we receive such inquiry then we will proceed with the orders_”. He added that his Korean suppliers had experience in the manufacture of moon pool covers. For the _Hankook_ bid, he had worked with his package manager Mr Alex Pan.

116    Mr Li indicated that when he had received an inquiry from _Keppel Singmarine_, he had asked for an extension of time to respond as he had needed to discuss with his suppliers in Korea. In this respect, Mr Li was especially conscientious as he had made inquiries on the vessel where the articles were sought to be fitted, as the moon pool covers would have to be undergo welding with this vessel. He had sought to ensure that _Hankook_ could prepare and customise the moon pools and “_prepare the correct quotation._”[^121].

117    After a series of correspondences where _Hankook_ had sought clarifications, the company had sent a priced quotation on 16 February 2015 at 4.11 pm. This was accompanied by an offer sheet dated 15 February 2015.[^122] Mr Chee had then averred to a ‘_mistake of numbers of quantity_’ in the quotation and asked for a resubmission from _Hankook_. Mr Li had noted that the error[^123] had been on Mr Lawrence Chee’s part rather than _Hankook’s_, where the former had inadvertently specified four hydraulic power units rather than the required seven hydraulic units. This issue had been rectified the very next day with _Hankook_ sending a revised quotation on 17 February 2015 and Hankook had at 4:31pm that day from Mr Chee who had stated “_Dear Alex, quotation as above received. Please also revert with your acknowledgement to our draft contract attached_.” Hankook had reverted on the 27 February 2015, with comments on various technical subjects.

### According to PW9, no meeting with Hankook was held, despite their request on 4 March 2015

118    Thereafter there had been a steady stream of correspondences, which culminated with a request by _Hankook_ for a meeting which was framed in the following terms:

> Dear Mr. Lawrance,

> **_As per our tele-conversation, could you please arrange_** **_technical meeting_** **_by tomorrow for clarify the followings_**:

>> \- 1. Moon pool panel is "Step type" or "Flush type".

>> \-2. Meeting Time: Morning or Afternoon).

>> Name: Li Yong Xlng

>> Vehicle no. (_stated_ )

>> Thanks & Regards,

>> Alex Pan / Y. X. LI

>> Hankook Engineering Pte Ltd

119    There was a significant divergence between the prosecution and the accused’s cases in whether a meeting was convened. It was PW9’s evidence (which cohered with PW2 Lawrence Chee’s evidence) that **_no meeting_****[^124]** was ever held between _Hankook_ and _Keppel Singmarine_, despite the request. Mr Low however communicated his impression that a **_meeting_**[^125]**_had_** been held, albeit that this being based on his indistinct belief that “_it’s supposed to…take place_”. The DPP had characterised this to as a deliberate refusal to meet with _Hankook_ because Mr Low “_refused to give them a fair chance_”.[^126] The DPP held this as a stark contrast with Mr Low’s treatment of Union Marine, having granted the latter a direct audience on 12 March 2015, with Mr Lawrence Chee also in attendance. As matter turned out, _Hankook_ did not pursue the proposal to meet proceeded on their own accord to contact their Korean suppliers to clarify identified issues (which Mr Chee had highlighted in a subsequent email).

### “Deadline” of 9 March 2015 imposed

120    Mr Li next encountered a rather bluntly worded communication from Mr. Chee on 9 March 2015 at 7:52am, where he had told Hankook “_Dear Li and Alex, please note that the deadline for submission of the updated proposal which fulfils the engineering requirement is by end of today, 9th March 2015_.”. Mr Li recalled that he had provided an interim reply to seek an extension to reply on 11 March 2015 or 12 March 2015. He had on the furnished a full quotation on 4.47 pm of the later date and had received a terse response from Mr Low himself at 8.08 pm that[^127]:

> Dear Li and Alex

> Your Hydraulic power unit should be independent serving EACH Moon pool.

> Therefore should be 7 HPU for each moon pool.

> **_Pls update your quotation accordingly_**”.

> Regards

> (Mr Low)

> \[Emphasis added\]

121    I would observe that Mr Low’s call to “_Pls update your quotation accordingly_” pointed to an apparent indication to the recipients that _Hankook’s_ bid remained at play. This being so as there could be no other use for an updated quotation. Mr Li had complied, and on 18 March 2015, with a message beginning “_Sorry for late reply. Regarding to subject project, we are pleased to submit our revised proposal_’ and submitted the quotation[^128] which became the central locus of the cheating charge against Mr Low, after he had purported to exclude the bid from the Bid Analysis Table.

122    Mr Li stated that while _Hankook_ was not awarded the contract for the project, this was not the end of the company’s involvement in the project. He recalled that in “the following year” _Keppel Singmarine_ had sought Hankook with “_the same request_” which had involved the moon pools Hankook had previously quoted for in relation to the Hull 389. While Mr Li had described this incongruous development as “_weird_”, _Hankook_ had been pleased to accept, and proceeded to complete the contract.

### Evidence of PW10 Chan Jian Yun

123    PW10, Chan Jian Yin (“Officer Chan”) was a CPIB investigator, who had conducted a bank screening exercise while investigating the accused. The Bureau had investigated Mr Low pursuant to information that he had favoured Union Marine in the bidding process for a _Keppel Singmarine_ project, and this had aroused suspicion that the accused might have received bribes from his counterparty in Union Marine. Officer Chan added that it was “normal” procedure to check on his personal bank accounts.

### “Suspicious transactions” uncovered by CPIB

124    Officer Chan indicated that the investigation had uncovered noteworthy deposits that he had classified as “suspicious transactions” in early to mid-2015 and comprised[^129]:

> \-On 20 January 2015, a cash deposit of $100,000 into Mr Low’s UOB bank account.

> \-On 5th February 2015, two $5,000 cash deposits into his bank account.

> \-On 19 March 2015 a sum of $50,000 deposited into his account on 19th March 2015.

> \-On 27 May 2015, a sum of $10,000 was deposited into the bank account

> \-On 16 June 2015, there had been a cash deposit of $10,000 followed by another $80,000 cash deposited into his account, the following day; 17 June 2015.

125    At cross-examination, Officer Chan indicated that despite the transactions being regarded as suspicious, the investigations could not establish that Mr Low had received the monies from Mr Raymond Tay or any other person in Union Marine.

## THE DEFENCE’S CASE

### Evidence of DW1 Low Chee Keong

126    Defence counsel indicated that there were no plans for a submission of no case,[^130] Upon the administration of the allocution, the accused indicated his choice to give evidence on his own behalf. As the accused’s background, work experience and level of educational attainment are relevant to assess whether his exclusion of the _Hankook_ bid was a deliberate act pursuant to an intent to cheat, I will delve into this aspect. Mr Low possessed a master’s degree in Maritime Studies, as well as a double degree in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering. He had first graduated in 2005 and attained his master’s degree in 2012. Mr Low had joined _Keppel Singmarine_ as an assistant commercial manager in 2006, been promoted to commercial manager before taking over the purchasing department in “2012 or 2013”. Hence Mr Low was in his **_ninth_** year in the company in March 2015, having had managerial responsibilities from the time he had joined in 2006.

### Circumstances behind the selection of Hankook and Union Marine

127    Mr Low stated that the Hull 389 project had been awarded to _Keppel Singmarine_ since 2014, and he had tasked Mr Lawrence Chee to handle the moon pool purchase. _Keppel Singmarine_ had a pre-approved list of suppliers known as the **_Maker’s List_** which was the first resort.in sourcing for vendor sib-contractors. At the material time, the only company in this _Maker’s List_ that been prepared to quote had been TTS Marine. As there was a need to send requests for quotations (RFQ) to garner least three quotations for the moon pool hatch project, it was Mr Low himself who had **_recommended_** that Mr Lawrence Chee solicit quotes from Union Marine and _Hankook_.[^131] Mr Chee had accordingly complied to obtain the RFQs.

### Why Union Marine and Hankook had been recommended

128    Mr Low stated the basis of his selection to be premised on the fact that _Keppel Singmarine_ already had “_some dealing_(s) _with Union Marine and Hankook_”, and the two companies “_basically_ (had) _some hydraulic background_”.[^132] This was especially desirable as the construction of moon pool, apart from structure, required the knowledge of hydraulic systems. He had been aware of the hydraulic background of the companies from previous projects, with Union Marine handling hydraulic valves, and _Hankook_ having suppled hydraulic lifts.

### Accused’s reason for excluding Hankook

129    The most fundamental question is this case, of course, lay on whether the accused’s reason for excluding _Hankook_ had been predicated on a fraudulent purpose, or if he had acted from a good faith belief that he had a valid basis to do so. Mr Low took the latter stance, by arguing that _Hankook’s_ delays in properly providing a full set of specifications for their review gave him a basis to distrust their competence to fulfil the contract. The accused had alluded to _Hankook_ posing questions about the job scope and asking about various questions about the dimensions of the vessel before committing to give their specifications, but had tolerated these in February 2015, as the “_cut-off date_” was “_sometime in March_” 2015. [^133] He also noted that _Hankook_, after sending their quotation on 17 February 2015, had also asked for concessions from _Keppel Singmarine’s_ draft contract such as being excused from sea trials and a reduction in the rate of liquidated damages claimable in the event of delay. He had had Mr Lawrence Chee send Hankook’s submission for engineering review. When he did not hear any further from the Engineering department, he presumed that “_Hankook actually can’t even provide the full technical specs for Engineering review_”[^134] When queried about _Hankook’s_ email of 4 March 2015 requesting a meeting to clarify the type of moon pool that was being sought, Mr Low admitted that he did not have any clear recollection but insisted that if a meeting was requested, it “_usually_” would take place[^135].

### Accused’s exercise of ‘discretion’ on ‘late bid’

130    In Mr Low’s narrative, _Hankook_ had dragged on with more queries until Mr Chee had sent an email on 9 March 2015, at 7:54am, with an ultimatum “_Any late submission will not be entertained. Reacceptance, consideration will be based on the discretion of_ (Keppel Singmarine).” Mr Low stated that the clause was to deter suppliers who failed to observe deadlines. In such circumstances, it was up to _Keppel Singmarine_ to decide whether to reconsider as there was a “_schedule to catch_” As to the person vested with the authority to decide on exercising the discretion whether to accept a bid com, Mr Low identified himself as the proper authority. In his own words, he had reasoned “_For purchasing at that point of time, I will make the discretion because I’m leading the department”._ Mr Low would consider how tight the schedule was to make a decision whether “_should we give extra leeway or not. That is how I exercised my discretion_.”[^136]

131    Mr Low had conceded that there were “_no clear guidelines on this exercising of discretion in our protocol or policy_” but where there was a matter of urgency, it was incumbent on the “_the head had to call it shots to make the things to move on_”, adding “_otherwise, what’s the function of the head of department_…_?_” In his view, the department had already accorded much support to _Hankook_ but they had not provided what he regarded as proper specifications. He had also derided Hankook’s subsequent submission of a scope of supply on 12 March 2015 as inadequate and seemed a ‘_copy and paste’_ job rather than a properly completed quotation. To be clear, Mr Low had merely queried[^137] if _Hankook_ had made any error in the number of hydraulic power units (HPU) and did **_not_** reference any other inadequacy, much less accuse Hankook of perpetrating a ‘_copy and paste job_’, on their proposed scope of supply. This all (along with Mr Low declining to meet them) did not deter Hankook from sending their final submission dated 17 March 2015[^138], which was received on 18 March 2015. This mistake might have occurred as Hankook had in an interim reply, promised to revert by 12 March 2015.

132    By his own account, Mr Low had decided not to entertain any further submissions from Hankook stating:[^139]

> Yes, Your Honour, after the 12th March submission, basically I just tell Lawrence to ignore that because what’s the point of reviewing after the deadline? In fact, …**_our bid analysis is based on the cut-off date to prepare, and Engineering already advanced on certain matters, why should we restart everything again purely for a late submission?_** So, and what makes me thinks that I mean, in terms of Hankook will able to respond within a short time period, …we don’t actually really have to wait for them despite our, so many support and chasers.

> \[Emphasis added\]

### Accused’s testimony on strict cut-off date of Bid Analysis Table is irreconcilable with accounts of Keppel Singmarine decision-makers

133    I should add at this juncture that Mr Low’s position of the Bid Analysis Table being a static and crystallised document which immutably set out all bids submitted at a cut-off date was **_diametrically_** opposed to the evidence of _Keppel Singmarine_ decision-makers who had taken the stance that the Bid Analysis Table must reflect the most current ‘_state of play_’ of the entire slate of vendors who had suppled valid bids, along with a listing of other parties who had been invited to bid, and non-viable bids. Their evidence was that the Bid Analysis Table was a decision-making tool to establish the most feasible bid. I should also add that the accused wavered in whether _Hankook_ had already been added to the Bid Analysis Table at the time he purportedly “exercised his discretion” to exclude that company’s bid. This will be addressed in the later part of these grounds.

### Accused’s claim to have used his ‘discretion’ to grant favourable performance bond terms to Union Marine

134    Mr Low claimed to be fully aware that the bond provided for in the contract (which he also variously referred to as ‘refund bond’ or ‘bank guarantee’ or ‘BG’ ) was intended to afford _Keppel Singmarine_ protection “_in case the vendor took a down-payment, don’t perform the job, and just took the down-payment and disappeared._”[^140] He argued that the refund bond was needed more in instances involving new vendors that _Keppel Singmarine_ was not familiar with. The accused argued that vendors would suffer if _Keppel Singmarine_ was inflexible in wanting an upper hand stating “_If all contract that Keppel wants to be upper hand and squeeze down all vendors, I think if the vendors suffer, of course, the_ (project vessel) _also will suffer_.” This was so because the imposition of demands for refund guarantees constrained suppliers from their ability to “_roll their business_.” He thus argued that in contract negotiation, it was best to “_read all the contract terms and conditions in totality_” and argued that it was within his purview to waive the bond terms where he trusted the supplier’s record and experience:

> “Okay, why not since **_I have experience with you, I have confident_** (sic) **_with you_**, **_I can waive_** away the (bond) since … I never see a directive that (bank guarantee) is a must in _Keppel_ (Singmarine) policy. It’s bound to negotiation. Unless Keppel says that “It is a must. And it’s a non-negotiable contract”...

> \[Emphasis added\]

### The accused’s confirmation that the confrontation with PW2 and PW3 did indeed take place

135    Mr Low argued that there had been no impropriety in his actions as, while he had removed the refund bond from the first tranche payable to Union Marine under the contract, he had taken care to keep the final five percent payable to Union Marine “intact” and secured by a performance bond. The prosecution’s case was that this had taken place after intense lobbying from his subordinates, (especially PW3) to maintain all the usual bonds found in _Keppel Singmarine’s_ standard contracts in place, and where Mr Low had only acceded to keeping the aforesaid requirement for the final five percent payment. Turning back for a moment to the evidence of PW3; Quincy Cheah, the actions described by Mr Low had bred a considerable degree of mistrust culminating with Mr Cheah, asking Mr Chee to keep an eye on the accused.

136    For context, it would be useful to see PW3 Mr Cheah’s motivation from this fragment of his spirited exchange with counsel at cross examination[^141]:

>   
| 

DC:

 | 

Now, Mr. Cheah, you said in evidence that you asked (Mr Chee) to monitor (Mr Low’s) movements. Can you elaborate on that?

 |
| 

 | 

…

 |
| 

A

 | 

I was just only saying that we have to monitor how he purchases future items.

 |
| 

 | 

…

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And how did you expect (Mr Chee) to do it---to carry out that task?

 |
| 

A

 | 

If in any case (Mr Chee) faces a similar situation, he can at least escalate the matter… to higher management.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, am I correct to say you asked (Mr Chee) to monitor my client’s purchase of future items because it was part of your job?

 |
| 

A

 | 

No, but when I see something that is not of the norm, I will advise my colleagues to seek for higher management’s opinion based on this.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

I see. But is it your job to monitor (Mr Low)?

 |
| 

A

 | 

It’s not stated in my JD[^142].

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Then, what gives you the right to ask an even more junior colleague to monitor the head of purchasing’s purchase of future items?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I think he’s a senior manager… I stand corrected, **_the senior manager_**… **_I would say if I see something not of the norm, we have to voice out_**. So, there is no right or no authority to say that I cannot do it.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Is it the norm for you to do so?

 |
| 

A

 | 

This is my first time encountering this, so I want to know.

 |
| 

 | 

…

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Now, am I correct to say by asking (Mr Chee) to monitor (Mr Low) and by you, yourself, to a certain extent also monitoring (Mr Low), **_you had already by that time form_**(ed) **_the view that_** (Mr Low) **_had wrongly excluded Hankook and that_** (Mr Low) **_was wrong in allowing the bank guarantees for the first instalment and the fifth instalment to be the way they were?_**

 |
| 

A

 | 

**_Yes._**

 |
| 

\[Emphasis added\]

137    Mr Low had recalled his confrontation with both subordinates in his office but did not regard the principal issue in contention to be the Bid Analysis Table. Rather he had taken issue after overhearing Mr Cheah express certain concerns to Mr Chee about his conduct of the Hull 389 project, and expressed umbrage over the two men “_talking the subject like watching on_ (sic) _my back_. [^143] Despite taking this position, Mr Low, nevertheless, agreed that he had sought to explain to them at the confrontation why he had removed _Hankook_ from the Bid Analysis Table. Mr Low did not agree that he had spoken with a raised voice or adopt a condescending tone. When challenged whether he had shouted at the two men, and was now asserting that both were untruthful about their accounts to discredit them, Mr Low asserted that he had spoken in his usual tone, and he ‘didn’t know’ [^144] if his subordinates were telling the truth about the assertions of his abusive conduct. Mr Low had also disagreed with Mr Chee’s assertion, which was made in the latter’s email[^145] to _Keppel Singmarine’s_ Executive Chairman Toh Ko Lin, that Mr Low had told Mr Chee that they had already been “more than fair to _Hankook_” in their handling of the bids. When asked if this meant that Mr Chee was lying, the accused had given a curiously uncertain one-word response “_Probably_”.[^146]

138    When DPP Jasmin Kaur asked the accused if he had also shouted at another individual on a separate occasion (I presume that the learned DPP had meant Mr Chinna from the Engineering department), Mr Low responded, “_I don’t think so_.” Mr Low disagreed with the DPP’s ‘put’ question that the reason he had confronted them, and apprehended a need to explain his removal of _Hankook’s_ bid, was predicated on his knowledge that he had done something wrong and felt constrained to justify his actions. Notwithstanding this final response, Mr Low’s wan and ambivalent responses to the DPP’s questions on the circumstances of the confrontation were worthy of note.

### Defence’s account of the provenance of the monies deposited into accused’s bank account between January 2015 and June 2015.

139    Mr Low gave oral evidence in relation to the aggregate sum of $260 000 found by CPIB investigators to have been deposited between January 2015 and June 2015, that the bulk of these monies found in his UOB personal bank account had actually come from his **_grandmother_**, who had given him a sum of around $250 000 in 2011 or 2012. The accused’s grandmother could not be called, as she had unfortunately passed on in January 2015 from pneumonia[^147]. Mr Low’s evidence was that the monies were kept in their residence until after her demise. What was remarkable was Mr Low’s evidence of the manner that she had allegedly maintained a sum of about a quarter of a million dollars in a “_small can box_”.

140    The exchange between DPP Jasmin Kaur and the accused is set out below to allow a full appreciation of the manner that this area of his testimony seemed to unroll on the DPP’s mildly facetious suggestion that she had kept the monies in a “_Milo can under the bed_.”,[^148]

>   
| 

DPP:

 | 

You want us to believe that you kept cash of $250,000 in your house for about 3 years?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Because my grandmother was not putting the bank---the money in the bank. So, **_she was---she was very ill that time._**

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, how do you keep this money? **_Do you keep it in a Milo tin under the bed or anything else_**?

 |
| 

A

 | 

**_She put in a can box something like that._**

 |
| 

Q

 | 

In the---what box?

 |
| 

A

 | 

In a can---container box.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Container box.

 |
| 

A

 | 

**_It’s a small can box_**, lah.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And it’s what? Under your bed?

 |
| 

A

 | 

No, uh, in the room.

 |
|

141    Mr Loh’s evidence was that his grandmother had lived with his him and his brother. He added that he was uncertain what his brother had received from her. Mr Low confirmed that he had applied the sums to a property investment but denied that the monies had come from Mr Raymond Tay, after the DPP had noted that the payments in seemed to coincide with the timing of the moon pool project development and had been in consideration of favouring Union Marine in the bid. Mr Low argued that Mr Tay would not be giving him an “_upfront payment_” as a bribe.

### Why the accused’s account of receiving the monies from his grandmother from a tin is implausible

142    To say the least, there were several aspects of the accused’s account of his grandmother’s leaving him an _inter vivos_ gift of $250 000 that do not check out. I do not propose to delve too deeply into these issues, given their tangential connection to the cheating charge. Nevertheless, a brief survey of this aspect of his evidence is certainly _apropos_, as Mr Low’s iteration of the background ought have an impact on the court’s overall assessment of Mr Low as a credible or candid witness. When I had sought clarifications on the dimensions of the box, Mr Low had described the receptacle to be a ‘biscuit container’ of 40 by 40 centimetres, and the notes to be in denominations of $50 to $1000. Mr Low added that his grandmother did not leave a will, and had while alive, made disbursements from the contents of the biscuit tin to settle his brother’s debts.

### Motive of grandmother withdrawing $250 000 from bank because she was ‘very ill’ not borne out from medical evidence

143    It was curious that Mr Low could not tell precisely where his grandmother; Mdm Ng Pheck Geok, had withdrawn the monies from, before they were placed in the biscuit tin that he described (which was described but not exhibited in the proceedings). In the exchange above, Mr Low had indicated to his grandmother having an aversion to keeping the sum in a bank because she was “_very ill_”.

144    This was not borne out by a medical report from Boon Lay Corporation Clinic[^149] which showed a rundown of 20 consultations from April 1998 to June 2014. Mdm Ng was noted to have **_optimally_** controlled hypertension and osteoarthritic knees as her principal ailments. While Mdm Ng was said to have withdrawn the monies in 2011 and 2012,[^150] she **_never_** saw her family doctor, at all in those two years and logged just five consultations between 2009 and 2014. Her final consultations in April and May 2014 had involved respectively fully controlled hypertension, upper respiratory tract infection and dermatitis on the first, and drug induced urine retention and dry eyes on the second.

145    Mdm Ng’s certificate of death showed her demise having occurred on 6 January 2015 from pneumonia, a condition which she had reportedly suffered from for three days. Until then, there had never been any evidence that she had been “_very ill_”. There was thus no presenting chronic or acute medical condition on record which would have cohered with Mr Low’s description of her motivation to leave $250 000 in physical cash in a tin container, as the precursing event to Mr Low being found to have deposited equivalent sums to his UOB account.

### Accused’s wavering over how his grandmother had accumulated the sum found in his UOB bank account

146    Yet another source of contention was the source of Mdm Ng’s _largesse._ Mr Low had in his oral testimony stated that his grandmother, who was illiterate and apparently never worked, had nevertheless acquired three properties in her lifetime. He added that the family would “_never question my grandmother where her money came from also_”.[^151]

147    This account was questioned by the prosecution, which produced a statement recorded by the CPIB where he had indicated that the deposits were “_winnings from illegal 4D bets that my grandmother had bought_”.[^152] Mr Low, who did not challenge the admissibility of the CPIB statements, indicated that he had meant that his grandmother had bought the properties mentioned **_with_** her winnings from 4D bets. This seemed to be a hastily thought-out contrivance by the accused, as the relevant portion his CPIB statement, set out in full below never mentions the monies ever being proceeds from the sale of property, but direct “winnings” from 4D betting, with the word “**_winnings_**” actually mentioned twice in the same sentence at \[30\] of the statement.

> With regards to (_prior reference that_) “The money was winnings from illegal 4D bets that Mr grandmother had bought”, **_I wish to clarify that when my grandmother passed me the monies, she had told me that the_** **_winnings_** **_were from illegal 4D_** **_winnings_**, I do not know for certain it really was, I presumed it to be true because I know that she bets on illegal 4D and had won monies from betting on illegal 4D too.

### Only evidence of grandmother’s disposition of property involved a HDB apartment in 2004

148    At trial, Mr Low indicated that he had no evidence showing that his grandmother had three properties but had adduced a document[^153]showing his grandmother’s disposition of a HDB flat, which was, in 2004, sold for a sum of $245 000. He alluded to the monies he deposited in OUB having come from the nett proceeds, adding that Mdm Ng had no CPF, and hence would receive the proceeds in cash. He added that she had given him the monies years later in 2011 or 2012.

### Evidence of DW2, Low Boon Keong

149    The second defence witness was Mr Low’s own brother, Low Boon Keong. The brother’s evidence concerned three areas, the first that Mdm Ng had funds to give to him when he experienced financial hardship after sustaining losses from gambling ‘_quite aggressively_’ at a casino. In this regard, she had been in a position to disburse $ 10 000 to him. The second was that she did make 4D bets and share her winnings with her grandchildren. The third was that she had mobility problems and used a wheelchair. Interestingly, when asked by DPP Charis Low if she was “_quite sick_”[^154] to seek congruence with the accused’s account of Mdm Ng being allegedly being “_very ill_”. Notably, the brother reflected some surprise by the question and with seeming puzzlement sought clarification “_Mmm. Sick in term of what sick_”, before finally generalising to conclude “_Uh, I think old people all got illness_”. All in all, other than apparently contradicting the accused on their grandmother’s poor heath, DW2 made little impact in this case.

150    From DW2’s own evidence, the fact that the grandmother made **_at least_** one large disbursement of $10 000 to settle the brother’s gambling debts (where DW2 readily admitted to having become a problem gambler at local casinos) actually worked against the defence case, given that the amount in the HDB transfer document as receivable by Mdm Ng was specified to be $245 000 in **_2004_**. Even in the unlikely scenario that there had been no further drawdowns in intervening period between 2004 and her alleged gifting of the residual monies kept in the “biscuit tin” to the accused in 2011 or 2012, this is still significantly short of the $250 000 that Mr Low claimed he received.

### Accused’s association with Union Marine’s Raymond Tay

151    Yet another essential aspect of this case was the nature and extent of Mr Low’s relationship with Union Marine’s managing director, Mr Raymond Tay. When asked by DPP Jasmin Kaur whether she could correctly identify Mr Low as a ‘friend’ of Mr Tay, the accused had demurred, and stated that Mr Tay was a **_business associate_**, and that the relationship was no different from that with any supplier.[^155] In Mr Low’s initial CPIB statement in January 2016, Mr Low had mentioned having known Mr Tay for over ten years through work, with the association having predated the former’s employment at _Keppel Singmarine_.[^156]

### Accused’s loan of $50 000 to Union Marine’s Raymond Tay

152    When the learned DPP had segued to assert that Mr Low had, despite this apparent remoteness in association, **_lent_** Mr Tay a sum of $50 000 several years before the material time, Mr Low had persisted to insist that Mr Tay was “**_not really a friend_**” but a person he knew who had made the request that he had acceded to because of an “_urgency_”. He insisted that the arrangement had been covered by an IOU or promissory note of sorts, which contained a promise to pay, and persisted to register his disagreement the prosecution’s put that he would not have lent the sum of money to Mr Tay if he were not his friend. Mr Low’s loan was disclosed in the following terms in his statement to CPIB where the accused had a plainly different characterisation of his relationship with Mr Raymond Tay: [^157]

> I had loaned (Mr Tay) $50 000 about three years back when he **_just started his company_**. **_I agreed to lend him the money_** **_as a friend_**. I also chased him to return the money to me… (Mr Tay) returned the $50 000 through a cheque about a month later…

153    Mr Low’s about turn, with his contention that this was an arms-length transaction of two individual without any mutual interest, close association, or affinity with each other was, in my judgment, simply implausible. This was considering that the sum was more than a third of his annual emolument of $130 000 to $140 000 a year, as disclosed in his CPIB statement[^158]. This was also considering that Union Marine was at its highest risk of failure or loan default as a nascent company.

### Accused’s shifting characterisation of his relationship with Union Marine’s Raymond Tay

154    In his court testimony, Mr Low had vacillated wildly within a spectrum of identifying Mr Tay as a ‘_friend but not a close friend_’ to ‘_business associate_’ and finally back to ‘_not a friend_’ all within the space of several minutes. While I would be loath to reproduce large swathes of transcript, the exchange below clearly shows the quality of Mr Low’s “_flip-flopping_” evidence, which had a strong flavour of prevarication, equivocation, and calculation in simply defining his relationship with Mr Tay[^159].

>

 | 

Mr. Low, I want to go back to your relationship with ‘Raymond’, okay. You’ve told us that ‘Raymond’ was not your friend, yes?

### Prosecution’s bid to impeach accused’s “evasive and inconsistent” evidence in relation to his relationship with Union Marine’s Raymond Tay

155    This apparent prevarication had ultimately led to an application by the prosecution to impeach Mr Low’s credit using two of his statements to the CPIB. One of these has been set out[^160] above in a preceding paragraph. The other passage stated[^161]:

> I am now asked by the recording officer to elaborate on my relationship with Raymond Tay. **_I treat him as_** **_a normal friend_****_._** I got to know him 15 years ago…

> Sometime in late 2012, after I was appointed the Senior Manager for Purchasing, Raymond Tay contacted me again. **_He had contacted me because he wanted to introduce his products to me._** He wanted to introduce his products to me **_because I was then in charge of purchasing_**…

156    The passages were all duly explained to the accused by the DPP[^162], who meticulously sought to ascertain that accused realised the full implications of his own statement where Mr Tay seemed to be using the stated “_friendship for business purposes_”[^163] in the same sentence where the accused had unabashedly stated Mr Tay’s interest in introducing his products had been predicated on Mr Low having the status of the one ‘_in charge of purchasing_’ in _Keppel Singmarine_. Mr Low had again hedged to say that “_every vendor and each supplier_” would come to introduce their business products to him.

157    When the DPP had asked the obvious question “_But not every vendor is your friend_?”, Mr Low had ‘doubled down’ to insist “_I treat them equally as my friend_” before declaring his own all-encompassing ‘hotch-podge’ definition which granted the equivalency of “_business associate_” with “_friend”._ Mr Low’s idiosyncratic amalgamation of work and personal relationships was expressed in the following terms: “_What I meant is_ **_normal friend, business associate, friends_**” (all being the same). The learned DPP had pointed out that his relationship Mr Tay must have been “**_special_**” given the $50 000 loan the accused had previously extended. She had ultimately put it to Mr Low that “_Mr Raymond Tay is_ **_more than a business associate_**” leading to Mr Low responding “_Disagree, that’s your assumption_”.

158    Given the above, I would have been hard put to disagree with the prosecution’s contention that “_the accused was_ **_evasive and inconsistent_** _in his testimony regarding Raymond (Tay) of Union Marine who was eventually awarded the H389 hatch covers contract.”_[^164] It is plain that Mr Low was an experienced professional, who held a master’s degree and the lived-in experience of a 38-year-old at the material time. I would find it hopelessly improbable that he would have lacked the insight as to fail to discern the difference between a **_personal_** friend, and business associates with whom one might maintain cordial ties, but still maintain a professional distance from, and not regard as a friend.

159    I was satisfied that Mr Low was aware of the distinction when he gave his statements in P15 and P16 to the CPIB. The context of the statements (i.e. in relation to the $50 000 loan in P15, and concerning Mr Tay seeking to introduce his products to the accused as _Keppel Singmarine’s_ purchasing head in P16) make it eminently clear that Mr Low was referring to Mr Tay as at least a **_personal_** friend. I am also of the view that Mr Low’s persistent attempts to downplay the implications of his statements and obfuscate the nature of his relationship with Union Marine’s Raymond Tay, would form an objective basis to impeach his credit as a witness of truth.

### Evidence of DW 3 Tay Beng Chuan Raymond

### Identification of accused as a “good friend”

160    DW 3 Tay Beng Chuan Raymond (“Mr Raymond Tay” or “Mr Tay”) gave his evidence as the final defence witness. As a point of interest, it was defence counsel had first alluded to the two men enjoying a **_friendship_** in his question to Mr Tay:[^165]

>   
| 

DC:

 | 

OK where you borrowed $50,000 from my client. Can you describe what you perceive as **_the quality of your_** **_friendship_** with my client in 2013?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Um, I will say it’s **_very much_**…**_normal_** I will say.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Normal?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yah. It…**_nothing fantastic_** for that matter

 |

  
  

161    Mr Tay would later concede that he and Mr Low were **_good friends_** at cross examination albeit that this position was arrived at after Mr Tay was reminded that this was what he had previously told a CPIB investigator. When the question had first been posed without the prompt, Mr Tay’s response had been more ambivalent, and where he had initially stated “_I_ **_won’t say good friends_** _but… we have_ **_nothing against each other_** _for that matter_.”[^166] Mr Tay had made an adroit about turn when DPP Andrew Low had then asked the question again, this time referencing Mr Tay’s CPIB statement[^167]:

>   
| 

DPP:

 | 

I put to you that you, when asked to describe your relationship with the accused person… you told the CPIB investigator that **_you were good friends_**. Do you agree or disagree?

 |
| 

A

 | 

**_Good friends_**. Okay, I agree

 |

  
  

162    When asked why he had denied being _‘good friends_’ with the accused earlier, Mr Tay had glossed over his earlier response and asserted that “_there is nothing in particular to deny or not to deny_” but then re-affirmed that he and Mr Low were “_good friends_”.[^168] The above would, in my view, suffice to show that Mr Tay was not especially inclined to volunteer information of his association without being confronted with his prior statement.

### DW3 deleted WhatsApp messages upon revelation by accused that he was under investigation

163    This quality made Mr Tay’s grudgingly obtained concession that he and Mr Low were good friends to be far more likely to reflect the true nature of their relationship. It is a particularly telling that Mr Koh had deleted his own messages with the accused from his _WhatsApp_ chat upon being informed by the accused on one of their lunch meetings that Mr Low had been called to attend at a CPIB office to assist in investigations.[^169] This was a fact he did not dispute under cross-examined while he was giving his evidence. While he did not admit to having given any bribes to the accused in connection with the present charge, Mr Tay was aware of the implications of his actions in deleting the chats[^170]:

> Q    Now, Mr. Tay, would you agree that if there was nothing to worry about the messages, there was no need to delete the messages? Do you agree?

> A    I agree.

164    Mr Tay stated that his association with the accused had dated from at least 2005, and included having coffee and drinking sessions with him. Mr Tay had also admitted that the two had also met for lunch. All in all it was quite plain that the level and intensity of their association had been much deeper than Mr Low had represented. I would thus consider Mr Low’s characterisation of their relationship as nothing more than business associates as objectively false, and would amount to a _Lucas_ lie, alongside the accused’s misrepresentation that there were only two bids to Mr Abu Bakar and other _Keppel Singmarine_ decision makers, which the prosecution has similarly characterized to be a _Lucas_ lie.

## ANALYSIS

165    The essential ingredients for cheating are elucidated in the oft-cited case of _Gunasegeran s/o Pavadaisamy v Public Prosecutor_ \[1997\] 2 SLR(R) (_Gunasegaran_) where Yong Pung How CJ (“Yong CJ”) had set out[^171] the ingredients of an offence under section 420 of the Penal Code. This would be: _Firstly_, that the victim had to be **_deceived_**. _Secondly_, that the deception had **_induced_** the victim to deliver any property to any person. _Thirdly_; there had to be a **_dishonest or fraudulent intention_** on the part of the deceiving person to induce the victim to deliver the property (ie to cheat) before the offence could be made out.

### The elements of the offence

166    The elements, when extrapolated to the ingredients of the charge would involve four distinct elements:

> (a)     That the accused acted dishonestly

> (b)     That the accused had concealed that Hankook had submitted a fully valid quotation for the supply and installation of moon pool hydraulic hatch covers for vessel Hull 389, which ought properly to have been incorporated to the Bid Analysis Table

> (c)     This concealment had induced _Keppel Singmarine_ to award the contract to Union Marine

> (d)     The award was an act which _Keppel Singmarine_ would not have done if the party had not been so deceived.

167    There is not much controversy that the _Keppel Singmarine_ had awarded the contact to Union Marine, the lower quote in a field of just two viable bids. It also settled from the evidence of _Keppel Singmarine_ decision makers that their decision to award had been in ignorance of _Hankook’s_ far lower quotation, in what would have been the third bid. It was also quite settled from witnesses such as PW3 Quincy Cheah that, absent exceptional circumstances, the lowest quote would prevail. The first two elements of _Gunasegaran_ were therefore plainly established. The main contest in this case would thus principally concern the question of whether Mr Low can be said to have **_concealed_** the _Hankook_ quote from a **_dishonest_** or fraudulent intention to induce the victim, _Keppel Singmarine_ to deliver the property, here award the contract to Union Marine.

### Accused’s relationship with Raymond Tay explained his continued partiality in treatment favouring Union Marine against Hankook, and his suppression of this relationship amounted to ‘Lucas lies’

168    The foregoing parts of these grounds have shown that Mr Low and Union Marine’s Managing Director Raymond Tay had a long-shared history, extending to the latter asking for, and receiving, a loan of $50 000 from the accused in 2013[^172]. The obfuscation of this friendship is also apparent from the foregoing, where Mr Low had sought to convince that the two were mere business associates and Mr Tay treated as if he were any ordinary supplier doing business with _Keppel Singmarine’s_ purchasing department that Mr Low was the head of. I will delve deeper into this area but I would first state my sense that Mr Low’s prevarications in relation to the true standing of his relations with Mr Tay in this regard are _Lucas_ lies, and the fact of these untruth being told are corroborative of the accused’s dishonest intent in relation to his actions which ultimately favoured Union Marine.

169    The principles are concisely stated in the High Court’s decision in _Er Joo Nguang and another v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 1 SLR(R) 756</span>, where at \[52\] as follows;

> The relevant authority on the effect of lies told by an accused is the English case of _R v Lucas_ (Ruth) <span class="citation">\[1981\] 1 QB 720</span>; \[1981\] 2 All ER 1008. There, the English Court of Appeal held that the mere fact that an accused told lies should not be taken as evidence of his guilt, although these lies could, in appropriate circumstances, amount to corroboration because it indicated a consciousness of guilt. Lord Lane CJ held at 724 that there were four criteria to be satisfied before an accused’s lie could amount to corroboration:

>> The lie … must first of all be deliberate. Secondly, it must relate to **_a material issue_**. Thirdly, the motive for the lie must be a **_realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth_**. … Fourthly, the statement must be clearly shown to be a lie by \[independent\] evidence

>> \[Emphasis in the original\]

### Application of Lucas principles to accused’s misrepresentation of his relationship with Raymond Tay

170    Starting with the lie of Union Marine’s Mr Tay being a mere **_business associate_**, the fact of the accused being “**_good friends_**” with Mr Raymond Tay has been established by the latter himself confirming the status of their relationship when reminded by the prosecution of what he had told the CPIB. Mr Tay had indicated that their closeness was not merely in relation to the extension of the loan of $50 000 in 2013 (which Mr Tay intriguingly described as a “_friendship loan_”[^173]), but also in their meets-up for meals and events where alcoholic beverages were imbibed, adding that the frequency of their meetings had been as high as “_almost every week_”[^174] at a certain point of their relationship. The **_materiality_** of the lie is that he was bound to honestly see through the procurement process and deliver a Bid Analysis Table which conformed to the standard requirement that all parties invited to bid were featured. The omission of the true nature of the relationship was, I would judge, from a **_realisation of guilt_** and a **_fear of the truth_** given that Mr Low’s partiality in dealing with Union Marine’s bid would suddenly make sense, especially to his subordinates Lawrence Chee and Quincy Cheah, who had increasingly looked askance at his actions, which invariably favoured Union Marine, and who suffered conspicuous expressions of displeasure when they had sought to persuade him to change his course.

### The accused’s preference of Union Marine had spanned the entire procurement process

171    The evidence showed Mr Low developing an interest in the moon pool hatches of the Hull 389 project, having made rather trenchant remarks against the Marine Technology Division’s (MTD) decision to engage **_TTS Marine_** on 23 January 2015, which seemed at first a principled position but would later appear to be an attempt to inveigle an opportunity for Union Marine to bid on the project.

### The accused had raised obstacles to using TTS Marine’s design as pricing was not settled, but later promoted Union Marine’s design in an unpriced proposal

172    According to his court testimony, Mr Low was aware that the Hull 389 contract had been signed in late December 2014, and that the process to procure moon pool covers would have commenced sometime in “_early January 2015_”[^175]. The email trail that PW2 Lawrence Chee had supplied included a message on 23 January 2015 where Mr Low had criticised MTD’s Nigel’s proposal to use TTS Marine’s designs as the basis for preliminary design work by insisting that contract and pricing details ought to first be settled, and rather stridently to not tie down to any specific vendors on the design, When Dr Nigel Koh had sought to explain his view, the accused had responded with added vehemence including telling Dr Koh “_The way you explain has no logic”._ The accused had added that the danger of using the TTS Marine’s moon pool cover as a reference to _Keppel Singmarine’s_ design now without settling price, delivery time and contractual terms would make changing vendors difficult and lead to _“really a big problem_.”[^176]

173    There had been a veritable sea change in Mr Low’s position “_not to tie down_” to any particular vendor who had not rendered a **_priced_** proposal with detailed terms acceptable to _Keppel Singmarine_, when he had on 16 February 2015, asked Dr Koh to use a Union Marine’s proposal for the project design work for Hull 389. Dr Nigel testified that had found this “_strange_”[^177], as despite the stern admonition, the accused subsequently sent him Union Marine’s **_unpriced_** proposal.

### The accused had also pressured the Engineering department and the Marine Technology Division to approve Union Marine’s submissions and drawings even when they were assessed inadequate

174    The accused’s preferential treatment of Union Marine had also been noted by officers in _Keppel Singmarine’s_ Engineering department, when the unpriced quotation had been sent for a technical review on 12 February 2015. PW2 Lawrence Chee had echoed Dr Koh to observe that it was abnormal to commence an engineering review if the vendors had sent a “_technical proposal that has no price_”[^178] as the eventual price could be too high for _Keppel Singmarine_ to accept, and thus render the review nugatory.

175    Furthermore, when PW6 Mr Chinna[^179] had been handed Union Marine’s proposal[^180], members of his department highlighted inadequacies in the submission, and had thus raised queries to clarify areas which were essential to properly assess whether and how the moon pool hatches could be installed on the vessel. Mr Chinna had noted that there were merely generic line drawings of the _Parosha_ moon pool that Union Marine had sought to source, where he had expected technical drawings which could be used for considerations of fitment of the moon pools. The persistence of these unclosed queries had become a focal point of contention between the accused and Mr Chinna, who testified that he had eventually been pressured to ‘_close the comments_’ on these outstanding issues.

### Accused had told the Marine Technology Division that moon pool drawings would only be suppled after Union Marine had won the contract

176    It was not just Mr Chinna who had noted the absence of suitable preliminary drawings, as other departments had also flagged issues with Union Marine’s proposal. Mr Shafiquzzaman from the Marine Technology Department had asked for Union Marine to supply general arrangement (GA) drawings. These were standard requirements, but Mr Low had taken Union Marine’s side to tell MTD that the moon pools were custom made to suit _Keppel Singmarine’s_ requirements, and Union Marine would only produce the AutoCAD drawings **_after_** the contract had been signed. Essentially this pointed to Mr Low’s favouritism, as his position at this point was effectively that Union Marine should be **_confirmed first as the successful bidder_** **_before_** that company could produce the requested general arrangement (GA) drawings.

177    Mr Shafiquzzaman had been so frustrated by Mr Low’s response that he had requested that Union Marine follow _Hankook’s_ example in providing the appropriate drawings for MTD’s analysis. He had asked for Union Marine to “_simply could give their existing design from some of their other project which is close fit_ **_like what we have received from Hankook_**.” _Hankook’s_ drawings had, of course, been submitted before the accused purported to reject _Hankook’s_ bid after his ultimatum of 9 March 2015.

### The accused had privately met Union Marine’s Raymond Tay on 12 March 2015 even as he denied Hankook’s request to meet

178    Apart from the above instances of the accused’s apparent bias during the early part of the procurement process, Mr Low had dealt directly, or met with, Mr Raymond Tay on various occasions at the material time of early 2015. These personal dealings were especially incongruous given that Mr Lawrence Chee was the **_point person_** for the procurement department in relation to the Hull 389 project. Mr Chee had noted Mr Tay’s tendency to contact Mr Low directly rather than _via_ himself as the designated point person in relation to the supply of drawings for engineering review[^181]. The most glaring example of Mr Low’s direct attention at Hankook’s expense was where Mr Low had met Mr Tay **_directly_** on 12 March 2025, but had denied _Hankook_ such a meeting, despite their request on 4 March 2015[^182], to clarify the new specifications which were communicated to both Union Marine and Hankook on 3 March 2015.

### The accused’s removal of the refund bond for the first instalment was a preference of Union Marine against his own employer

179    Mr Low had preferred Union Marine against the interests of _Keppel Singmarine_ in allowing the removal of the refund bond payment for the first 20 percent of the instalment payments for the contract between _Keppel Singmarine_ and Union Marine, and only agreeing to retain the Performance Bond Payment for the last five percent of the instalment payment in the finalised contract after intense persuasion of PW2; Lawrence Chee[^183] and PW3; Quincy Cheah. The latter had found it “_unusual for Keppel Singmarine to give a huge deposit without a bank guarantee_”[^184]. PW 8; Abu Bakar, who was _Keppel Singmarine’s_ Managing Director, had registered his strong disapproval of the notion of removing the clause, which was standard for their contracts. He noted that the purpose of the refund bond was to protect _Keppel Singmarine’s_ interests to ensure that contractors performed all they had been contracted to do satisfactorily. Any withdrawal of the requirement for a refund bond would leave the company vulnerable to a situation where “_your contractors can just walk off… after collecting your payment_”.[^185] For perspective, the amount (being 20 percent of the contract sum of $2 540 000) involved, would have been the very considerable sum of $508 200.

180    Given these considerations of business risk, it was notable that Mr Low had been adamant about maintaining his stance to exclude the requirement for Union Marine to furnish a 20 percent refund bond, ignoring Mr Chee’s and Mr Cheah’s ministrations to adhere to their standard practice. The accused’s explanation that he had done so to allow the vendor; Union Marine, to “_roll their business_”[^186] after taking the down payment, and that they should not be encumbered with the additional expenditure which came with furnishing the refund bond, did not suggest that the interests of his own employer were at the forefront of his contemplation on this issue.

181    Indeed, Mr Low curiously took the converse line to articulate his concern that contracting vendors would “**_suffer_**” financially “_(_i_)f all contract that Keppel_ (Singmarine) _wants to be_ (sic) _upper hand and squeeze down all vendors_”. If anything, the accused’s position of allowing the vendor free play to _“roll their business_” after receiving a down payment from _Keppel Singmarine_, did suggest a certain financial **_precariousness_** in Union Marine’s financial position (if the mere provision of a bond would have such an adverse impact despite the receipt of a tranche of $508 200), putting in question why he would have mooted that company as the preferred choice for the moon pool supply contract in the first place.

### There had been no urgency to complete the bid analysis process at the time the accused purported to drop Hankook’s bid

182    The sequence of events leading to _Hankook’s_ exclusion began with the accused’s deadline, where Mr Chee had been directed to draft an email[^187] to _Hankook_ on the following terms:

> Hi Lawrence,

> Pls give them a deadline… we are **_running out of time_**, If Hankook cannot commit a **_proper specs_**, please reject then.

> \[Emphasis added\]

183    It is notable that **_both_** Hankook and Union Marine missed the 9 March 2015 deadline. As mentioned above, PW9; Li Hong Xing from _Hankook_ had earlier sought clarification but was never granted a meeting. By a stark contrast, Mr Low inequality in treatment between the two companies was in full play when he had granted an audience to Mr Raymond Tay on 12 March 2015 to meet for “_price negotiation_”. What was particularly telling was that Union Marine had been asked to look for an alternative moon pool hatch manufacturer from China for _Keppel Singmarine’s_ consideration.

184    The two salient aspects to note from the above developments would first be that Mr Low’s declining to see _Hankook_ representatives would show him to be less than serious about ensuring that _Hankook_ produced ‘_proper specs’_, assuming that that had indeed been a real issue. The second would be that the fact of the accused suggesting to Union Marine on 12 March 2015, to source for alternative makers from China, showed that they were hardly “_running out of time_”. _Hankook_ had also been fully co-operating and had not just produced specifications with an updated and priced quotation on 18 March 2015 but had also confirmed to Mr Chee on 23 March 2015 that they were offering a full ‘turn-key’ product for the price offered.

### Accused’s reasons for disregarding Hankook’s bid as communicated to PW2 are slightly different from those stated in his testimony

185    The evidence in this regard would have come principally from the testimonies of PW2 and the accused himself, with some differences between the versions. On the version communicated to Mr Lawrence Chee, PW2 recounted this episode in his letter to CPIB. To allow a juxtaposition of this point for analysis, I have reproduced it again for easy reference:

> On 18th March, Hankook submitted their updated priced quotation. From here, I have tabulated the prices receipt from all the participating vendors including Hankook into the bid analysis and submit for (Mr Low’s) review. **_Patrick questioned me on the capability of Hankook for this equipment_**.

> Hence **_I was instructed to remove Hankook from my bid analysis as he explained to me that they are not qualified to design and was not "apple to apple” compared to Union Marine and TTS. 1 was told not give the wrong impression to our management with the price indicated from Hankook._**

> \[Emphasis added\]

186    It is important to note that in either case, the accused has never disputed telling Mr Chee to exclude _Hankook’s_ bid from the Bid Analysis Table. He did however give a slightly different explanation for his rejection of Hankook’s bid at trail in March 2020. In this regard Mr Low’s court testimony was that the **_first quotation of 15 February 2015_**[^188] was “**_not a proper quotation_** _and invalid to be presented in a bid analysis_.”[^189] On the other hand, Mr Low had testified that the **_final quotation_**[^190] dated 17 March 2015, and received on 18 March 2015, had come in **_too late_** to be cleared or included in the Bid Analysis Table because the Engineering department had not reviewed it and he had deemed _Hankook_ to not be sufficiently responsive to be worthy of consideration. In his own words: [^191]

> And this quotation on P8, 17th March (2015), …came in quite surprisingly. And this was a point when Lawrence (_Chee_) came to me and he print it out and told me that, “Hey, we received this quotation, surprised. So, what to deal with it?” I just say, “**_You put aside, you ignore first. You don’t need to entertain someone who are not so responsive_**.” So, because on one hand…we are going to finalise Union (_Marine’s quotation_) very soon, so my decision was that, “Uh, so …**_are you telling me that we should put everything aside now_**, okay, **_and go and favour Hankook which don’t even really bother us when we give chaser_**, things like that?”

> \[Emphasis added\]

187    I do not doubt that the procurement department at _Keppel Singmarine_ still had substantial lead time on 18 March 2015, as Mr Low himself had asked Union Marine to seek out a **_possible alternative moon pool hatch maker_** from China on 12 March 2015. This quest would have taken time, first from identifying potential alternative makers, eliciting that their interest to bid, receiving their quotations and then arranging for the designs to undergo the same process of technical reviews by the Engineering department and design oversight by officers of _Keppel Singmarine’s_ Marine Technology Division.

188    The ground reality of the situation, as discerned from the accused’s own court testimony, appeared that as of 12 March 2015, Mr Low had been determined to shut out _Hankook_ and single-mindedly promote Union Marine’s bid. He would have known since 29 January 2015 that the only other bidder with a complete quotation, TTS Marine, had placed a significantly higher bid, giving the Union Marine bid an excellent chance of success despite TTS Marine being on _Keppel Singmarine’s_ list of pre-authorised makers, and the initial preferred choice of Marine Technology Department designers. Mr Chee had evidently been unaware of the accused’s intent and had proceeded to place _Hankook’s_ bid _per_ their submission dated 17 March 2015, on his draft Bid Analysis Table. He had thus been taken by surprise by Mr Low’s direction to exclude that bid.

### There were no valid concerns of any delay on 18 March 2015, the date the final quotation was received, that might have affected the final timeline for procurement or bid analysis

189    As matters stood, the Bid Analysis Table was only considered in late April 2015. The sense that there was still a _‘_**_long runway’_** to complete the task assigned to the procurement department would have been bolstered by the fact that on 23 March 2015, Mr Low had called for **_fresh_** requests for quotations (RFQs) from two other marine engineering companies “_Cargocare Asia”_ and “_AEG_” to make their bids to supply moon pool hatches for the vessel Hull 389 project.

190    While the accused has attributed the need for a technical review to be a reason he had rushed matters, citing the need to adhere to a “_a cut-off date_” and that the “_internal deadlines of March_ (2015 were) _closing_… _for the purchasing exercise_”,[^192] PW6; Mr Chinna from the Engineering department had clarified in his testimony that a technical review could have been completed in just three to five days, and the reason why _Hankook_ did not receive the clearance was because their final quote[^193] dated 17 March 2015 was **_never_** submitted for a technical review. The responsibility for forwarding submitted quotes for review was, of course, the province of Mr Low’s procurement department.

### The assertion that Hankook did not submit proper specifications in their quote is contradicted by witnesses from Keppel Singmarine

191    The other premises of Mr Low’s assertions regarding _Hankook’s_ unsuitability in his communications to Mr Chee and his court evidence do not stand to close scrutiny. Starting with whether _Hankook_ had provided proper specifications, this aspect was best exemplified by the evidence of PW6; Mr Chinna. Mr Chinna had found the quotations and drawings in _Hankook_’s quote to be complete. Indeed, he had found the _Hankook_ quote to contain **_more_** salient technical information than the Union Marine submissions[^194]. Notably, Mr Chinna’s bugbear had been that the Union Marine bid had contained insufficient information and lacked the general arrangement drawing (GA) he had needed to conduct a proper technical review. _Hankook_ had tendered moon pool drawings adapted from a past project. Which assisted in the technical review (and implicitly allowed for the recipients to gauge the company’s experience and competence). Notably too, Marine Technology Division personnel had requested that Union Marine emulate Hankook’s example in providing appropriate drawings.[^195]

### The assertion that Hankook was not responsive is not borne out from the document trail and witness accounts

192    Mr Low had alluded to Hankook’s alleged unresponsiveness as a basis to drop their bid. Aside from issues of propriety and proportionality in taking this drastic step, which will be dealt with later in these grounds, there is scant evidence of _Hankook_ failing to respond to queries or requests from _Keppel Singmarine_ officers in the relevant period. Indeed, Hankook had been the first to deliver a fully **_priced_** quotation, dated 15 February 2015, which was received by _Keppel Singmarine_ on 16 February 2015. Union Marine’s **_priced_** quotation was only received on 25 February 2015.

193    When the deadline of 9 March 2015 was imposed on both firms, _Hankook_ had sent an interim reply[^196] on 10 March 2015 and sought an extension. Hankook had duly sent their final quotation dated 17 March 2015. By 18 March 2015, the accused had, by his direction to Mr Chee, apparently already made up his mind to exclude _Hankook_. It was evident, however, that _Hankook_ had been working under a handicap, with the accused denying a request to meet _Hankook’s_ General Manager Li Yong Xing, even as the former had directly met Union Marine’s Raymond Tay on 12 March 2015. _Hankook_ had nevertheless, after ascertaining some details from Mr Chee, proceeded to liaise with their Korean suppliers to deliver the quotation some five weeks before the Bid Analysis Table was evaluated. If anything, _Hankook_ demonstrated initiative and pro-activity in pressing on despite the stated impediment.

### The accused’s exclusion of Hankook’s bid exceeded the scope of his authority

194    PW5 Quek Shian Pin, who was the Project Manager made it clear that **_all_** quotations had to be incorporated into the Bid Analysis Table, and that even ‘_non-compliant_’ bids should have been included.[^197] This was because the Bid Analysis Table was the **_single_** document[^198] consulted by the various stakeholders, being those from procurement (Mr Low), commercial (PW4, Mr Poon), engineering (PW 6, Mr Chinna) and himself as the Project Manager, with the final two signatories would be the Executive Director (Mr Toh Ko Lin) and Managing Director (PW8, Mr Abu Bakar).[^199] It would thus be the case that any omitted quote would be rendered **_invisible_** to the panel, and I was of the view that the accused was aware of this fact.

195    This position was echoed by PW8; _Keppel Singmarine’s_ Managing Director Abu Bakar’s evidence was that a Bid Analysis Table operated as a veritable dashboard to allow easy access to all salient information on the project for the decision-makers. The inclusion of all invited parties was for the purpose of being able form a full picture in this decision-making process. Thus, information that should have been incorporated should have included the listing of vendors who were invited but **_declined_** to quote. Mr Abu Bakar indicated that even quotations that had been marked for rejection or as non-preferred on the basis of engineering issues, had to be **_included_** in the Bid Analysis Table.

196    It was also PW5’s evidence that the Bid Analysis Table has always remained open to accept viable **_late_** bids, and especially if existing bids are over the budget, which was certainly the case here. Contrary to what Mr Low had done, Mr Quek had stressed that there was no such thing as a hard timeline where bids would be cut off from consideration. The Bid Analysis Table could be redrafted at any time once the panel became aware of any need bid that should be considered.[^200]

### PW8’s evidence that a Bid Analysis Table with only two quotes was an anomaly that should have been explained

197    An aspect of this case which made the exclusion of the _Hankook_ bid exponentially more difficulty to justify would be the testimony of PW8 Abu Bakar who had stated that there should ordinarily be a **_minimum_**[^201] of three quotations in the Bid Analysis Table for _Keppel Singmarine’s_ management to review. He added that any deviation had to be specifically justified and explained to him, as it was “_not normal to have two_ (bids), _unless they have specific reasons_”.[^202]

### Accused’s claim that only TTS Marine and Union Marine gave quotations was another Lucas lie

198    Mr Abu Bakar recalled that Mr Low had brought him the Bid Analysis Table which had contained only **_two_** full quotations, with a recommendation for Union Marine to be selected, and claiming that the other five companies had been unable to quote. Mr Abu Bakar had subsequently found out that Hankook’s quote had been omitted and had commissioned an internal investigation. Mr Abu Bakar testified that Mr Low had **_specifically told_** him that only two bids, being the TTS Marine and Union Marine bids had been received. The prosecution has identified this as another _Lucas_ lie, made with a full realization of guilt and fear of the consequences [^203] I saw no reason to disagree from this assertion.

### It was never accused’s professional role to weed-out quotes that did not represent an apple-to-apple comparison

199    Simply put, the foregoing would have made it difficult for Mr Low to justify his position since his actions would contravene the standing instructions that _Keppel Singmarine_ had given the procurement department, which was, according to Mr Abu Bakar and Mr Quek, which was to faithfully include **_all_** quotes received into the Bid Analysis Table. The _Keppel Singmarine_ executives were categorical that it was not the accused’s job to ensure that _Hankook’s_ quote was “_apple to apple_” compared to Union Marine and TTS Marine’s bids, much less to suppress a quote on that basis. The procurement department’s job was simply to collate quotes, curate them, and represent **_all_** of them in the provided categories.

200    There was a provided space for the department to insert the procurement departments recommended bid, which was of course; Union Marine. As a decision had to be taken from a survey of all quotes, it simply did not make sense to **_weed-out_** any quote of a willing bidder, while leaving in the five names of companies who had been unwilling or unable to give a full quote. As Mr Low himself would personally attend the final meeting with signatories from the different departments, it would have been free for him to argue why the Union Marine quote was superior. Hence an objective and holistic determination was only possible with the inclusion of _Hankook_ in the Bid Analysis Table. As Mr Low had worked in _Keppel Singmarine_ since 2006 and been the procurement head since “2012 or 2013”, none of these considerations would have been lost to him. Mr Low’s concerns about the executives being deceived by _Hankook’s_ “low bid” also seemed odd, as the signatories included long serving individuals like General Manager (Commercial) Poon Tau Lum, who was a 35-year veteran of the industry at the material time.

### Hankook was well known to Keppel Singmarine executives

201    Mr Low had also expressed concern not to give the “_wrong impression to_ (_Keppel Singmarine’s_) _management with the price indicated from Hankook_.” For the context of his other discussions with Mr Chee, this appeared to be an attempt on his part to say that _Hankook_ was an **_unknown_** entity and a potentially **_unreliable_** vendor, and _Keppel Singmarine_ should not be enticed by what he characterised as an artificially low bid. This prospect was unlikely as all the called prosecution witnesses from _Keppel Singmarine_ had known and/or dealt with _Hankook._

202    All seemed to have known _Hankook_ better than Union Marine_._ For example, PW4; Mr Poon stated that _Hankook_ was involved on “_all sorts of things_” in the field of marine engineering, including fabrication and supply of industry equipment and fixtures. Union Marine, save the first name of its managing director, was not known to him[^204]. Mr Chinna, who was also unfamiliar with Union Marine, was effusive in finding Hankook to be very supportive and managing to complete their commissioned projects in the several occasions he had worked with that company.[^205] I should add that PW3; Quincy Cheah had had also registered doubts about Union Marine, and had been surprised that the company’s bid had been conferred the status recommended quote in the Bid Analysis Table. [^206]

203    I acknowledge that defence counsel had made a comprehensive bid to characterise Mr Low’s actions to be legitimate and grounded on his earnest application to his job as head of the procurement department, and that his actions were reasonable viewed from the situation he had to address in procuring the moon pools with attendant time pressures. What the defence ultimately failed to address was the sheer scale and magnitude of deviation, and even outright breaches of _Keppel Singmarine’s_ business practices (exemplified by his cancelling Hankook’s quote from the Bid Analysis Table, despite extant inclusion policies), and that these had **_invariably_** favoured Union Marine.

### Attempt to cover up by dictating PW2’s response to Keppel Singmarine’s Group Internal Audit after the ‘whistle-blower’ corroborated the prosecution’s case

204    The prosecution was able to show not just the fact that Mr Low had a close antecedent relationship with Union Marine’s Raymond Tay having favoured the company in the bidding process, and subsequently granted favourable contract terms (such as the removal of the refund bond) but could also show Mr Low attempted to **_continue_** to manipulate the narrative **_after_** the discovery of the omission of the _Hankook_ quote. This was evident in the manner that he had dictated Mr Lawrence Chee’s response to _Keppel Singmarine’s_ Group Internal Audit after the latter had received a ‘_whistle-blower_’ letter alleging improprieties in the procurement process for Hull 389’s moon pool hatches. To recapitulate, Mr Chee had recanted on the following passage which contained the now familiar phrases of “_we do not want to give wrong impression to management on the price indicated_”, and “it has to be _apple to apple comparison_”. For reference, the passage stated:

> Lastly, the reasons of failure in mentioning Hankook in the bid analysis is because the 1st quote submitted was not valid. **_We do not want to give the wrong impression to management on the price indicated. It has to be apple to apple comparison_**.

> \[Emphasis added\]

205    Mr Chee’s evidence had been that he had been directed to create a draft e-mail of the sequence of events and had been made to input _“necessary statements to further justify on the purchase_”[^207], with the accused maintaining close oversight by making handwritten amendments on Mr Chee’s printed draft and adding his own text,[^208] before approving Mr Chee’s ‘reply’ to be sent the Group Internal Audit department and Executive Director Toh Ko Lin.

206    On close analysis, I see no reason to doubt PW2’s account, which showed a calculated move by Mr Low to shape the narrative even after an internal investigation of his department’s alleged misconduct was underway. The fact of his not distancing himself to allow Mr Chee to render an independent response appeared to be the actions of a man in fear of adverse consequences arising from his acts, rather than a person reposing any confidence that his actions were wholly defensible.

### Collusion was unlikely as many of the prosecution witnesses were no longer with Keppel Singmarine

207    The prosecution witnesses’ oral testimonies cohered on one essential point; all had noted the accused’s aggressive promotion of Union Marine to a point where he had confrontations with most of the slate of the prosecution’s witnesses from _Keppel Singmarine_. He had appeared to be especially abrasive with junior staff in his own department; namely PW2; Lawrence Chee (whose interactions with the accused had formed the backbone of the prosecution’s case) and PW3 Quincy Cheah (who had reported the accused’s “_condescending_”[^209] tone at their confrontation). He had been antagonistic with mid-rank individuals from other departments, notably Mr Chinna from the Engineering department; and, to a lesser extent; Dr Nigel Koh from the Marine Technology Division, who had been disparaged by being told that “(t)_he way you_ (Dr Koh) _explain has no logic_”[^210] in respect of an early plan to seek rival bidder, MTS Marine’s help to arrive at a moon pool design. Mr Chinna had of course felt constrained to close his comments on Union Marine’s submission despite his unresolved misgivings after being accused of delaying the project. Even with Project Manager, PW5; Quek Shian Pin, Mr Low had pressured him to ‘green-light’ the Union Marine bid despite his reservations that the quotation had exceeded the allocated budget, by an **_appeal_** to higher authority, with Mr Quek being told that Executive Director Toh Ko Lin had ‘_already approved_”[^211] Union Marine’s bid, which had weakened his resolve to question the propriety of Mr Low’s proposal to engage Union Marine at a price which was a full $306 000 above budget.

208    There are two points to the above, the first was that Mr Low’s single-minded pursuit of the Union Marine bid, was one where he had become apparently uninhibited about estranging his professional relationships with an entire swathe of his subordinates and colleagues in _Keppel Singmarine._ A question thus arise as to his possible motivation, why would he do this, and what would he stand to gain from this? The second question that came to mind was in whether Mr Low’s alienation of his erstwhile colleagues might have increased the possibility of their colluding in their evidence against him. After pondering this issue, I was of the view that there would be a low possibility that any collusion had occurred, and the concordance in their accounts reflected the true state of affairs. This is because, save for PW2 and PW3, who were from the same procurement department, the other witnesses were all from different departments. More importantly, many of the witnesses had moved on from _Keppel Singmarine_ at the time they gave their evidence, some five years after the fact. Mr Chee and Mr Cheah had joined separate telecommunication companies in 2016, Mr Poon had retired, Mr Quek had left for Tat Hin Timber Pte Ltd, and Mr Chinna had joined a related company; Keppel FELS Ltd. Given this, I am confident that the prosecution witnesses were fully independent when they gave their evidence, and their tone and demeanour at trial did not betray any of these witnesses holding any animus against the accused.

### There was really no cogent explanation for the deposits of $250 0000 into the accused’s UOB bank account during the first half of 2015

209    The penultimate point that I would propose to address is that of the discovery that $250 000 had been deposited into Mr Low’s UOB account, where Mr Low had claimed to have received directly[^212] from his grandmother as an _inter-vivos_ gift which predated her death in January 2015 by several years. The prosecution has been clear that this is not an essential element of their case, or indeed the principal basis of suspicion against Mr Low for the proceeded cheating charge. The basis, rather, would have been, as argued by DPP Jasmin Kaur, premised on Mr Low’s conduct during the material time and his act of directing that the lowest bid be removed from consideration.[^213] While the monies could not be traced to Union Marine or Raymond Tay himself, there would be the remaining enigma of the series of deposits made **_from 20 January 2015_** and ending in June 2015. I would note that while the email chain on the moon pools started with the messages from Dr Nigel Koh **_on 23 January 2015_**, Mr Low was aware that the Hull 389 contract had been signed in **_late December 2014_**, and that the process to procure moon pool covers would have commenced sometime in early January 2015. He had answered Dr Koh’s 9.54 pm email within just 40 minutes, at 10.34 pm, with the firm admonition not to “_tie down to vendors_” on design, where Dr Koh had suggested using TTS Marine. The speed of his response pointing to Mr Low’s intense interest in the moon pool project, with his quick interception of Dr Koh’s proposal to use a rival marine engineering firm for design assistance.

210    Returning to the $250 000 deposited in the account within this six-month period, I found it difficult to accept that the monies had come from Mr Low’s grandmother, as the only tangible evidence of her potentially coming into any monies was upon the sale of her HDB apartment in 2004, where she had stood to receive $243 000, according to a document provided.[^214] The likelihood of Mr Low’s grandmother still having an equivalent sum in 2011 or 2012 did not appear probable given the attrition from drawdowns for her living expenditures for seven to eight years, and having made at least one payment to settle a heavy casino gambling debt owed by Mr Low’s brother. Further Mr Low had testified to the sum being **_divided_** by the grandmother between the two grandsons, with Mr Low professing ignorance over his brother’s actual share. In addition, Mr Low’s account of his grandmother disbursing the sums over a spectre of declining health in 2011 or 2012 was not borne out, as she did not even see her family physician in that period, and had no debilitating chronic diseases, being only acutely ill for three days before her death from pneumonia in January 2015.

211    It thus remained the case that the provenance of the $250 000 Mr Low had deposited was not satisfactorily accounted for, with his **_eventual_** version of the sum being reposed in a **_biscuit_** tin that she had kept **_under her bed_** beggaring belief, not least by the variability of his answer. Notably he had first mentioned the monies being kept in a “**_small can box_**” moments after the learned DPP had queried “_Do you keep it in a Milo tin under the bed or anything else_?”[^215] I should add that I had made a mistake during the ‘_questions by the court’_ phase of witness examination, and referred to the receptacle as a “**_biscuit tin_**”[^216]. Curiously, the accused had never corrected the court on this, and had proceeded to answer questions posed about the ‘_biscuit tin_’ as if this had been the very receptacle, he had mentioned a day before at his cross-examination. Another area where the accused’s memory apparently failed him was the location of the “_small can box_”/”_biscuit tin_”. He had at cross-examination on 9 March 2020 been asked if the receptacle was under a bed, to which he had stated “_No, in the room_”. When asked by the court the next day where Mr Low’s grandmother had stored the biscuit tin, the accused had responded “_I think it’s around her bed, lah_, **_under her bed_**”[^217]

212    There were therefore no plausible answers forthcoming from Mr Low on the origins of these deposits which had coincided in time with the negotiation and contract phase of the moon pool hatches, and it remains a fact that the amount at $250 000, is an enormous sum, amounting to about a tenth of Union Marine’s contracted sum of $ 2 541 000 for the supply of the moon pools, or slightly under two years’ salary for the accused, whose annual emolument was between $130 000-$140 000. While there had been no link to Union Marine as the payor, Mr Low’s wavering responses and implausible scenarios must necessarily make inroads to dent the perception of the accused as a credible witness of fact. His failure to explain away this sudden wealth would also mean that the unaccounted deposits would remain circumstantially relevant within the factual matrix of this case.

### The magnitude of difference in the Hankook quote made its removal difficult to justify

213    Mr Low’s exclusion of _Hankook’s_ quote is especially anomalous not just because _Hankook_ quote of $ 1 650 000, was $700 000 **_within_** the budget, but also because this had occurred in a scenario where **_both_** TTS Marine’s and Union Marine’s quotes **_exceeded_** the budget of $2 235 000. As Mr Abu Bakar had emphasized, the fact that there were just two quotes on the Bid Analysis required an explanation from the procurement department. Further it would have been necessary for Mr Low to seek the Budgeting division’s approval for an additional sum of $306 000 to pay Union Marine’s quoted price of $2 541 000 for the supply of the moon pool hatches.

214    More cogently, Hankook’s quote was a full **_$891 000 less_** than the Union Marine bid that he had planned to recommend. The sheer magnitude of the difference could not be lost to Mr Low, given that he had to actively **_seek_** increased funding from Mr Ching You Yi from the Budgeting division. As the foregoing would also show, Mr Low was also defying standing orders by failing to include quotes by all vendors who had been invited to quote, with even vendors failing to respond or those with problematic quotations also being listed for completeness and transparency. In doing as he had don, the accused had placed himself in a position to make a judgment call that should only be made by _Keppel Singmarine’s_ decision-makers at a meeting to consider the Bid Analysis Table, that is to select the most suitable vendor. Having worked at _Keppel Singmarine_ since 2006, Mr Low would have been familiar with the work processes and known that the Bid Analysis Table was the one document that the signatories from the various departments would refer to, and that keeping a lower quote from being reflected on the Table was the one and only way to allow Union Marine’s much higher quote to prevail. This much was substantiated by Mr Abu Bakar who had categorically stated that he would have refused to sign the Bid Analysis Table had he been aware of Hankook’s final quotation, dated 17 March 2015. I do not believe that Mr Low had acted by impulse, caprice, or whim, as he would have had received the Hankook quotation by 18 March 2015, allowing for over three weeks of contemplation before the first signatures were scheduled to appear on the Bid Analysis Table from 9 April 2015 onwards.

215    Indeed Mr Low’s thinly veiled attempts to create an environment favourable for Union Marine were evident throughout the procurement process, beginning with his placing Union Marine’s unpriced quotation for urgent Engineering review on 12 February 2015, which was irregular as it was considered premature to undertake an engineering review for an unpriced proposal as the unresolved price might be too high for _Keppel Singmarine_ to accept. Mr Low’s direct husbandry of the bidding process by granting personal meetings with Union Marine’s Raymond Tay but not Hankook was noted by his subordinates.

216    The prosecution was also able to show that Mr Low had imposed unrealistic deadlines on Hankook, which Union Marine did not seem to be subject to, even as both companies had breached the 9 March 2015 deadline. Mr Low had also created the strange tautology of calling the final Hankook quote an **_invalid quote_** as it had “_not cleared_”[^218]the Engineering review, which of course occurred because he had not deigned to send the bid for Engineering review in the first place, as he had considered it a late submission having missed the deadline of 9 March 2015.

217    It would be useful to recall Project Manager Quek’s evidence that there was no ‘**_hard_**’ cut-off timeline for quotes to be submitted, and even a completed Bid Analysis Table could be up ended and redrafted if a subsequent quote was found to exist. This extant protocol meant that the decision to exclude Hankook was Mr Low’s alone, and he had acted contrary to the instructions and role of the procurement department, which he himself had headed. There was simply no allowance for a submitted quote to disappear. Indeed, the orthodox process was to curate all quotes, even the less favoured ones, and hence it was the practice was for reasons to be given for the quotations that were not recommended for selection. It would be useful to recall PW3 Quincy Cheah’s evidence that the Bid Analysis Table ought incorporate **_all_** the vendors who had been invited to quote.

### All the elements of the charge are fulfilled

218    To now turn back to the essential elements that the onus of the prosecution was to prove were that

> (a)    that Mr Low had acted **_dishonestly_**

> (b)    That Mr Low had **_concealed_** that _Hankook_ had submitted a **_fully valid_** quotation for the supply and installation of moon pool hydraulic hatch covers for vessel Hull 389, which ought properly to have been incorporated to the Bid Analysis Table

> (c)    This concealment had induced _Keppel Singmarine_ to award the contract to Union Marine

> (d)    The award was an act which _Keppel Singmarine_ would not have done if that company had not been so deceived.

219    As indicated earlier, elements (c) and (d) are clearly fulfilled not least by the evidence of Mr Abu Bakar, who was unequivocal that he had been so induced from the absence of Hankook’s lower quote, which he had been completely oblivious of at the time he had signed the Bid Analysis Table. In respect of (b) Mr Low’s concealment was corroborated by Mr Chinna[^219] and General Manager (Commercial) Poon who had never seen _Hankook’s_ final quotation.

220    The principal element at play would of course be the question of Mr Low’s actions had been with a **_dishonest_** intent. It is extremely unlikely, in my judgment, that his exclusion of the _Hankook_ vote was due to any misapprehension of _Keppel Singmarine’s_ procurement protocol. given that Mr Low’s subordinates had registered disquiet about his inexplicable departure from _Keppel Singmarine’s_ protocol include all quotations in the Bid Analysis Table.

### Internal inconstancies on accused’s evidence on whether Hankook had ever been included in the Bid Analysis Table

221    The internal inconsistencies in Mr Low’s evidence on the preparation of the Bid Analysis Table betrayed the accused’s duplicity in respect of _Hankook’s_ quotation. Mr Low had logged a number of discrepancies, all in an apparent bid to justify his decision to exclude a “**_late_**” bid (which was, of course, not even a valid ground from prevailing _Keppel Singmarine_ procurement policies). It was PW2; Lawrence Chee’s evidence that he had prepared the first draft of the Bid Analysis Table on 18 March 2015, and had duly incorporated Hankook’s final quotation, dated 17 March 2015, Mr Chee had testified that Mr Low had made him remove the _Hankook_ quote. While defence counsel had not put any different case to PW2, the accused had taken a surprising turn in alleging that the Bid Analysis Table **_was completed on 9 March 2015_**.[^220] More significantly, Mr Low’s expressed position was that this Bid Analysis Table **_did not even include_** _Hankook_ in the first place (and hence there had never been any issue of removing any such bid). The prosecution has argued that this change in position was “_seemingly to reinforce the accused’s claim that_ (Hankook quotation) _P8 was naturally excluded as it was received “late” after the draft_ (Bid Analysis Table) _was already prepared_.”[^221] This position was also at odds with what had been stated in the Case for the Defence: [^222]

> 16\. … Hankook’s quote had not even commenced the technical clarification and acceptance by the Keppel Engineering department. Hence, Hankook’s quote should not be stated in the bid analysis table. Further … **_the Accused informed Lawrence_** **(**Chee) **_to remove_** **_Hankook’s quote from the bid analysis table._**

> 17… **_The Accused instructed Lawrence_** **_to omit_** **_Hankook’s quote from the bid analysis table_**. It was within the Accused’s scope of duties and powers, as the Senior manager, to review the details presented by contractors before proceeding to circulate the same for circulation within Keppel. More importantly, the Accused considered Hankook’s quote to be unsound/risky and lacking. The Accused was also concerned that Hankook may not perform its duties properly and cause loss to Keppel.

222    In my judgment, this back-dating of the completion of the Bid Analysis Table to 9 March 2015 smacked of an attempt at **_revisionism_** to prove his point that the _Hankook_ quote was late, and possibly justify his private meeting with Union Marine’s Raymond Tay just three days later, on 12 March 2015 to _inter alia_ settle issues of pricing. It had not occurred to him that this was the imposed date for revised priced quotations that **_both_** _Hankook_ and Union Marine had missed. What ought be noted was that Mr Low had also asked Mr Raymond Tay to source for an **_alternative maker_** in China.

223    This development certainly showed a situation in a state of flux, given that exploring the notion of finding a viable alternative maker other than _Parosha_ would have made the situation rather tentative on issues of schedule, price, and other important contractual terms, and hardly conduce to the level of finalisation expected of entries submitted for a proper bid analysis.

### Unlikely for Bid Analysis Table to be ready when requests for quotations (RFQ) were still being called

224    Even more cogently, a fresh set of requests for quotations (RFQs) had been sent to two more firms _Cargocare Asia and AEG_ on **_23 March_** 2015, showed Mr Chee’s version to be more likely to be true, that he had started on a draft on **_18 March_** 2015, been told to remove _Hankook’s_ bid, and had completed the Bid Analysis Table by inputting Union Marine’s Final offer of $2 541 000 on **_9 April_** 2015.

### Revision of time of completion of Bid Analysis Table was a bid to show Hankook was ‘late’ in their bid

225    Considering the above, I found this backward revision of the Bid Analysis Table to 9 March 2015 to be an afterthought and a contrivance to support Mr Low's contention of _Hankook_ being ‘**_unacceptably_**’ late, as to justify exclusion. The sheer variance of the accused’s reasons and his inability to account for discrepancies on essential details such as the time the Bid Analysis Table was created make it extremely **_unlikely_** that Mr Low had any valid reason, whether objective or subjectively perceived, to exclude the _Hankook_ quote, that had any nexus with his professional duties in promoting and defending _Keppel Singmarine’s_ interests.

## Summation

### The accused had planned to favour Union Marine from the beginning

226    Ultimately, it would be necessary to view Mr Low’s activities from January 2015 to June 2015 in a **_continuum_** and bear in mind his relationship with Union Marine’s Raymond Tay. Mr Low had, on 23 January 2015, first flagged the Marine Technology Division’s plan to engage TTS Marine, giving a strong critique against the dangers of committing to one firm and thus being locked-in to their design while pricing and other contract details remained unsettled. While this seemed a principled basis to introduce more bidders, Mr Low had taken this opportunity to solicit bids from a pool of vendors on 27 January 2015, which included Union Marine and _Hankook_. This thus allowed Union Marine a metaphorical “_foot at the door_” to engage in the to bid win the contract for the supply of moon pool hatches.

227    Mr Low had then surprising gone against his seemingly principled stand by sending Union Marine’s **_unpriced_** quotation for Engineering review. _Hankook_ had surprised Mr Low by sending a priced quotation on 16 February 2015 which was far lower than Union Marine’s bid. There had, in my view, been a systematic campaign of suppression of _Hankook’s_ bid from that point on, with a concomitant support, in manners both brazen and subtle, to prop up Union Marine’s bid to the forefront of the Bid Analysis Table as the recommended bid. Mr Low had even excused Union Marine’s failure to provide basic general arrangement drawings, stating that this would only be provided **_after_** the contract was signed with Union Marine. This overt and brazen advocacy and support of Union Marine had culminated in Mr Low, on 18 March 2015, ordering _Hankook’s_ bid to be removed from an early iteration of the Bid Analysis Table drafted by Mr Lawrence Chee, which was the critical act in the founding of the _actus reus_ of the proceeded charge.

### The accused’s actions favouring Union Marine had triggered a ‘whistle-blower’ communication

228    In course of his active campaign to promote Union Marine, he had brushed aside the concerns of his own subordinate officers, PW 2 and PW3. He had berated them in a confrontational meeting in May 2015 when it transpired that PW3; Mr Cheah had asked PW2; Mr Chee to monitor the accused, then, in what Mr Chee interpreted as an act of retaliation, had re-graded Mr Chee’s appraisal with a lower mark for a key performance indicator.

229    In my view, it is possible that Mr Low’s fractious relations with his subordinates might have played a role in the sending of the ‘whistle blower’ letter to _Keppel Singmarine_’s Group Internal Audit department. To recapitulate, the latter was attributed to PW2, although he strenuously denied authorship and intimated his belief that PW3; Quincy Cheah as the person who had penned the latter. Notably, Mr Low had played a major hand in framing PW2’s response to conform with his preferred account[^223] of Hankook’s exclusion being predicated on what he regarded as legitimate grounds. The reply was subsequently recanted by Mr Chee. Again, Mr Low’s ‘forced’ curation of the response is suspicious, as he would be expected to have let Mr Chee respond independently if he reposed confidence that what he had done was fully defensible.

### The accused used pressure tactics and deception to suppress dissent and obtain the required signatures in the Bid Analysis Table

230    As can be seen from the forgoing, Mr Low had imposed pressure on Mr Chinna to close his comments and agreed to favourable refund bond terms for Union Marine. Most significantly, Mr Low had obtained the required signatures from various departments and the leadership team in the Bid Analysis Table by coercive methods, and in the case of Mr Abu Bakar, by actual deception, where the latter had been falsely told that only two vendors had submitted quotations for the project. The fact of Mr Low deliberately and deceptively concealing _Hankook’s_ bid is well established from the evidence lain out by the prosecution.

231    All considered, Mr Low’s evidence was riddled with both internal and external inconsistences. The **_internal_** inconstancies include (as described in the foregoing)[^224] his wavering on **_when_** the Bid Analysis Table had been drafted and **_whether_** that Table had featured the _Hankook_ bid or just the Union Marine and TTS Marine bids.

232    The most obvious of the **_external_** inconsistencies in Mr Low’s defence case would be the simple fact that his purported exclusion of _Hankook_’s bid breached _Keppel Singmarine’s_ own polices to reflect all invited bidders. It was never the accused’s job to ensure that _Hankook’s_ quote was “_apple to apple”_ and given the depth of experience of the Bid Analysis Table’s signatories, they were unlikely to be led astray by an ‘artificially’ low quote in the manner Mr Low purportedly feared. Hence, Mr Low could not be said to be protecting _Keppel Singmarine’s_. interests by hiding the _Hankook_ bid. As an officer in the company since 2006, it was obvious that he should have left the _Hankook_ quote in the Table, to allow a comparison, and for the panel to evaluate its viability. As a member of the panel to consider the Bid Analysis Table, he would have been free to debate the relative advantages of the Union Marine bid that he had been so determined to recommend at a general meeting, whatever these benefits might have been.

233    In relation to the sum of $250 000 that he had deposited into his bank account, while the _provenance_ of the funds has not been traced back to Union Marine, Mr Low was unable to give any sensible explanation of how he came into such a large sum, representing a tenth of the contract sum awarded to Union Marine, and almost twice his annual salary. He had mischaracterised his relationship with Union Marine’s Mr Raymond Tay to be that of a mere business associate where the latter had admitted to being a ‘_good friend’_. I had found Mr Low’s mischaracterisation to be a ‘_Lucas_’ lie, as was his lie to Mr Abu Bakar and Mr Poon that there had been only two bids. On his part, Mr Raymond Tay had very suspiciously deleted _WhatsApp_ chats with the accused upon finding out that Mr Low was under investigation by the CPIB. All in all, I do not find Mr Low to be a credible witness of the case against him.

### Conviction

234    Given the above, I was of the view that the prosecution has proven its case beyond reasonable doubt and convicted Mr Low of the cheating offence specified in the single proceeded charge.

### Sentencing remarks

235    Mr Low has not appealed against the sentence of **_nine months’_** i**_mprisonment_** imposed. I will therefore append the sentencing remarks which were orally delivered[^225], just to complete the record, without making any further comment concerning the sentence imposed, in these grounds:

> (i)    These are my brief remarks. Mr. Low had after a 17-day trial, been convicted upon a single proceeded charge under Section 420 of the Penal Code. The charge have of course been in relation to Mr. Low’s dishonest concealment from his employers, Keppel Singmarine Private Limited (“_Keppel Singmarine_”) a lower bid of 1.65 million from Hankook Engineering Private Limited where he had been entrusted to oversee a procurement process for obtaining moon pool hatch covers. Mr. Low’s active suppression of Hankook’s quotes eventuated in the panel assessing the bids and _Keppel Singmarine_ to ultimately award the contract to Union Marine (Asia) Private Limited, a company I referred to subsequently as “Union Marine”, which had placed a bid of $2,541,000. Hankook’s bid was superior among the final competing bids.

> (ii)  To recapitulate, Mr. Low headed the Purchasing and Analysis Department of _Keppel Singmarine_, which was responsible for advising quotations from vendors and forwarding these quotations to the Engineering Department for technical review. I was satisfied upon an analysis adduced at trial, that Mr. Low had been motivated to ensure that the tender will be awarded to Union Marine because of his close association with one Tay Heng Chuan, Raymond, who is the third defence witness, a known associate of Mr. Low and whom I am satisfied to hold, upon the evidence adduced, to be a close friend of Mr. Low.

> (iii)  It should also be noted Mr. Low was found to have deposited a substantial sums which could not be satisfactorily accounted for from any known income accrual, employment bonus, or investment gain. Mr. Low’s claim of that these monies where from his since deceased grandmother, and stashed in a biscuit tin, to the point of their ultimate deposit to a bank account at or around the material time was utterly implausible, and must in my view to be regarded as a _Lucas lie_.

> (iv)  Suspiciously, Mr. Low’s brother, was not accorded the same beneficial _largesse_’ from the grandmother.

> (v)    On a distaff side, the prosecution was unsure of the provenance of the monies recovered and thus there was no proven link to Mr. Tay save the circumstantial fact of the accused’s preference for the former to become the inevitable winner of the bidding process.

> (vi)  To further recapitulate, Mr. Low’s acts in furtherance of his objective included his making a decision to reject Hankook’s bid on 9 March 2015, upon the ostensible basis of a final deadline being missed. The _actus reus_ was centred on a single act on 18 March 2015. Mr. Low had ordered a subordinate colleague, Mr. Lawrence Chee, which who was the second prosecution witness, to remove Hankook’s bid, which was expressed in US Dollar terms as 1.25 million from the Bid Analysis Table for hatch covers for a vessel that’s going to H389.

> (vii) In sentencing, I would note the considerable disparity between the bids which would have yielded a difference of $891,000 between the two quotations. I also agree with the prosecution’s proposition that while the selection of a vendor is dependent on more than just the price quoted, in a bid, the price in particular where a quote is within budget remains an important consideration.

> (viii)    Mr. Low’s offending is all the more brazen and egregious as Hankook’s bid was within the original allocated budget while the Union Marine bid exceeded the budget, and which necessitated the topping up from an additional budget allocation.

> (ix)  Mr. Low had also contrived and stacked the odds to a reduced pool of just two bidders in a table provided for decision makers at _Keppel Singmarine_. With only two quotes to choose, Union Marine’s relatively lower bid would have been almost inevitably selected.

> (x)    The facts also show that Mr. Low’s preference of Union Marine extended to allowing preferential terms in payment. The Prosecution would be correct to state that while it cannot be said that _Keppel Singmarine_ would have selected Hankook’s bid, _Keppel Singmarine_ was deprived of the opportunity to even consider Hankook’s bid which was a significant $891,000 cheaper than Union Marine’s. The Prosecution had also proposed that given that _Keppel Singmarine_ even had to increase the budget allocated to accommodate Union Marine’s bid, the difference between the quotations served as a rough proxy for the amounts of harm caused to _Keppel Singmarine_, which is a relevant and important consideration.

> (xi)  The epilogue is also significant in sentencing. Mr. Low’s act was uncovered after the failure of Union Marine’s moon pool hatch, which necessitates an intervention to save the situation. Hankook was able to complete the contract on the 1July 2016 for a sum of US $1,360,000. The aggravating factors in this case would be the accused’s grossly egregious abuse of his position of authority.

> (xii) Mr. Low had after all, been the head of the Purchasing Department in _Keppel Singmarine_, and hence ultimate authority in procurement matters.

> (xiii)    Mr. Low had imposed considerable coercive pressure to his erstwhile subordinates and colleagues, to bend to his will in procuring a favourable outcome for Union Marine, and of course, the examples are as follows: Mr. Lawrence Chee had testified of Mr. Low ordering him to remove Hankook’s quotation from the Bid Analysis Table, which Mr. Chee had felt constrained to comply. In terms of additional preferential treatments, Mr. Low had instructed Mr. Chee to remove the refund bond payment and performance bond payment from the contracts between _Keppel Singmarine_ and Union Marine.

> (xiv) Mr. Low had brazenly overruled Mr. Chee and Mr. Quincy Cheah’s concerns about this departure from the usual process, had also reprimanded the two men for questioning the H389 procurement process and gone to the extent of downgrading Mr. Chee’s yearly performance grading, which the Prosecution characterised as a vindictive act of retaliation.

> (xv)  Outside Mr. Low’s own department, Mr. Gnanapra Kasam Chinnadurai testified that the accused had pressured him into closing the comment sheet for the Union Marine proposal. The accused had also loudly upbraided Mr. Chinna, casting blame for causing delays to the project.

> (xvi) Now, turn to planning and premeditation, there was certainly planning as exemplified by Mr. Low’s unabashed preferential treatment for Union Marine, which had been evidenced in various stages of the procurement process with terms revised to assist his close friend’s company.

> (xvii)    The precise date that Mr. Low decided to favour Union Marine’s bid cannot be determined with certainty but it would likely have been after Hankook placed an unexpectedly low bid. The fact that Hankook’s bid was so significantly lower than Union Marine’s bid would have placed Mr. Low in a very difficult position of having to justify not just the exponentially higher bid of Union Marine, but also to justify one which exceeded the stipulated budget.

> (xviii)    It is understood that Union Marine’s attempt on the project was fraught with problems to the point that Hankook’s earlier bid was uncovered in attempts to rescue the project.

> (xix) This will lead to the next factor of difficulty in detection which is the only factor without especially aggravating circumstances. While it is true, as the prosecution had submitted, that the accused controlled the entire procurement process, and the scheme went undetected by _Keppel Singmarine’s_ senior management and affected parties such as Hankook, and culminated with the conclusion of the contract with Union Marine, Mr. Low’s behaviour, in particular, his riding roughshod over his subordinates and even Mr. Chinna who was not even in his department but was in another department, would have triggered concerns and scrutiny.

> (xx)  Detection, albeit after the fact, would therefore have been highly likely, given his brash conduct and of course, Union Marine’s poor performance of the contract. It is understood that arbitration is still ongoing with Union Marine, although not much else is known. I would add that there is no real basis for arguing any prolonged delay, given the nature of the case is a complex commercial crime and Mr. Low was charged in July 2018 against the events occurring within the period of 2015, which is not outside of the norm for such cases.

> (xxi) I am therefore unpersuaded that the Prosecution has been derelict in charging Mr. Low or causing him undue disadvantage. I do note that Mr. Low is untraced. Of course, the case law is also quite clear that this counts as a neutral factor.

> (xxii)    All considered, I hereby sentence Mr. Low Chee Keong to a term of nine months’ imprisonment

### Present status of accused person
