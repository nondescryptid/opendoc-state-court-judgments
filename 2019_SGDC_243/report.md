### District Judge Luke Tan:

## (1)   Introduction

1       The accused, Zkert M Rushdi, is a 56-year-old Russian national. He was alleged to have come to Singapore on several occasions to open corporate bank accounts in the name of Singapore incorporated shell companies for the purpose of cross-border money laundering.

2       Before me, he claimed trial to a total of 30 charges (“proceeded charges”). These consisted of 22 charges under section 471 read with section 465 and 109 of the Penal Code (PC) (“the forgery charges”), and 8 charges under s 44(1)(a) and punishable under s 44(5)(a) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (“the CDSA”) read with s 108B and s 109 of the PC (“the CDSA charges”).

3       Much of the Prosecution’s evidence was uncontested. The main dispute was over whether the mens rea of the offences had been successfully established.

4       At the end of the trial, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had discharged its burden to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt and the accused was convicted on all 30 proceeded charges. After an initial refusal to do so, the accused subsequently consented to the Prosecution’s offer to have another 13 charges taken into consideration for purpose of sentencing. These charges (“the TIC charges”) consisted of the following:

> (a)     6 similar forgery charges under s 471 read with ss 465 and 109 of the PC;

> (b)     4 similar CDSA charges under s 44(1)(a) and punishable under s 44(5)(a) of the CDSA read with s 108B and s 109 PC; and

> (c)     3 charges of cheating under s 417 read with s 109 of the PC.

5       The Prosecution initially sought a global sentence of 90 months’ imprisonment. Upon the accused’s consent to the remaining TIC charges, the Prosecution argued that as they involved an additional sum of USD333,033.80 in criminal proceeds, the global sentence should be increased to 96 months’ imprisonment.

6       Having considered the facts of the case, the sentencing submissions and precedents tendered, as well as the matter raised by the accused in mitigation, I sentenced him to a global sentence of 88 months’ imprisonment.

7       The accused has filed an appeal against his conviction and sentence.

8       For the purposes of these Grounds of Decision, as there was essentially no dispute over the legal elements that had to be satisfied in respect of the 30 charges, and as the bulk of the Prosecution’s evidence was also not disputed by the accused, I will give an overview of the proceeded charges and evidence before discussing in greater detail my findings on the relevant issues. In my judgment, I will also make reference to the relevant parts of the evidence, the Prosecution’s submissions and also to the arguments put forward by the accused, in order to explain why I found that the case against the accused had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

## (2)   Overview of the proceeded charges and the evidence

9       As stated above, the accused faced two types of charges: (a) forgery charges, and (b) CDSA charges. To recap, these consisted of:

> (a)     Forgery Charges: 22 charges of abetment by intentional aiding to fraudulently use as genuine documents, which he had reason to believe to be forged, for the purpose of opening bank accounts. These are offences under s 471 read with ss 465 and 109 of the PC; and

> (b)     CDSA charges: 8 charges of engaging in a conspiracy with a person known as Iho, and with Iho’s customers, to be concerned in an arrangement, having reasonable grounds to believe that by the arrangement, the control of their benefits of criminal conduct was facilitated, and having reasonable grounds to believe that the said Iho and Iho’s customers had engaged in criminal conduct. In pursuance of that conspiracy, the accused had assisted in opening several bank accounts in Singapore to be used by Iho and Iho’s customers to receive overseas fund transfers between August and September 2016, which sums the accused had reasonable grounds to believe were their benefits from criminal conduct. These are offences under s 44(1)(a) and punishable under s 44(5)(a) of the CDSA read with s 108B and s 109 PC.

10     In essence, the Prosecution’s case was that:

> (a)     The accused worked for a man known as ‘Iho’ or ‘Ihad/Ihab Khalil’[^1] (hereafter “Iho”) and helped Iho and Iho’s customers to open corporate bank accounts for shell companies set up in Singapore.

> (b)     To do this, the accused worked with a local corporate service provider DM Advisory Pte Ltd (“DM Advisory”) and recruited European nationals and a Singaporean nominee to be directors of two shell companies, Plutusteam and Birseltex. The accused also provided forged supporting documents to the foreign directors to fraudulently use as genuine in order to deceive the banks into believing that they possessed legitimate and genuine businesses overseas to support their applications to open the corporate bank accounts. These were the subject matters of the 22 forgery charges.

> (c)     The accused admitted in his statements that the foreign directors were merely lending their names as directors of these shell companies, and that they did not run the businesses as purported in the forged documents.[^2] Instead, it was Iho who instructed him to set up the shell companies.[^3] It was also ‘Iho’ who provided the forged documents[^4], and controlled the shell companies.[^5]

> (d)     The bank accounts opened in the names of these shell companies were controlled by Iho and his customers from overseas, rather than by their listed directors.[^6] These accounts were used to receive and transfer benefits of criminal conduct of these persons arising from predicate crimes (essentially cheating) committed in three foreign countries, namely, Australia, Bermuda and Indonesia. These were the subject matters of the 8 CDSA charges.

11     A broad overview of the 30 proceeded charges is as follows:[^7]

13     The Prosecution also tendered over a hundred separate exhibits, consisting of bank documents, email correspondence, chat logs, CD-Roms, statements of the accused etc.[^8] These included the following:

> (a)     Exhibits relating to forgery and CDSA charges for Birseltex, including:

>> (i)       Documents that were purportedly related to a business known as Cim Jack Trading, which itself was supposedly a business in Europe that was associated with one Birsel Cimen, the named foreign director of Birseltex. These documents were for Birsel Cimen to represent to the bank that she was genuinely running the business, Cim Jack Trading, so she could have a bank account opened in Singapore for Birseltex.

>> (ii)       Bank documents for Birseltex, and documents evidencing transfer of monies to Birseltex’s accounts; and

>> (iii)       Emails between the accused and PW13 Darrel Tan Hock Keat (“Darrel”), and between Darrel and PW11 Magdalene Ng Meijuan (“Magdalene”) attaching documents for the bank account opening of Birseltex.

> (b)     Exhibits relating to forgery and CDSA charges for Plutusteam, including:

>> (i)       Documents that were purportedly related to a business known as Avashoes Ltd, which was supposedly a business in Europe that was associated with one Harmanna Manger, the named foreign director of Birseltex. These documents were for Harmanna Manger to represent to the bank that she was genuinely running the business Avashoes Ltd, so she could have a bank account opened in Singapore for Plutusteam.

>> (ii)       Bank documents for Plutusteam, and documents pertaining to transfers of monies to Plutusteam’s accounts; and

>> (iii)       Emails between the accused and various personnel including Darrel and other persons, and between PW12 Melvin Lee Wei Run (“Melvin”) and Darrel.

> (c)     Exhibits relating to CDSA charge involving Glidertex. These included:

>> (i)       Bank documents for Glidertex, and documents pertaining to transfers of monies to Glidertex’s accounts;

>> (ii)       Police reports and emails relating to cheating of foreign victims; and

>> (iii)       Emails between the accused and Darrel.

> (d)     Exhibits relating to the CDSA charge involving Botitex, including:

>> (i)       Bank documents for Botitex, and documents pertaining to transfers of monies to Botitex’s accounts;

> (e)     Various Technology Crime Investigation Branch (TCFB) and other police reports;

> (f)     Chat logs between the accused and Iho, and between the accused and Darrel;

> (g)     Emails and documents from various witnesses, including Melvin, PW4 Norhaza Bte Said (“Norhaza”) and PW2 Ms Astoria Michelle Edwards (“Ms Edwards”);

> (h)     Correspondence between DBS and CAD, and between the accused and CAD;

> (i)     Evidence of laws from the jurisdictions of the foreign victims;

> (j)     16 statements of the accused that were recorded by different officers; and

> (k)     Miscellaneous other exhibits.

14     To prove its case, the Prosecution also adduced evidence of the foreign predicate offences and the transfer of funds into the accounts.

15     The DPPs relied very much on the accused’s admissions made in 16 statements that he had given to the police and to the CAD officers, which were recorded under s 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (“the CPC”), over the course of about 14 months from 26 October 2016 to 10 December 2017. They were admitted into evidence after the accused confirmed that they had been given voluntarily. These statements are as follows:

16     The Prosecution also produced chat logs that the accused had with Iho, as well as chat logs and e-mails that he exchanged with PW13 Darrel Tan Hock Keat (“Darrel”), as part of its case. The latter was the director of DM Advisory, a local company that the accused engaged to assist to set up the local shell companies and the bank accounts. In addition, Darrel, as well as bank officials from DBS and UOB bank, were among the witnesses called to testify against the accused.

17     At the end of the Prosecution’s case, as there was sufficient evidence to prove each and every element of the charges against the accused, his defence was called.

18     Essentially, the accused’s defence can be summarised in the following way.

> (a)     For the forgery charges, while the accused did not dispute that the foreign persons indicated as directors of the various shell companies were not actually the directors, the accused’s defence was that he did not have knowledge that the documents used for setting up the bank accounts were actually forged.

> (b)     As for the CDSA charges:

>> (i)       While the accused essentially did not dispute the evidence that proceeds of crime from cheating offences committed in Australia, Bermuda and Indonesia were received and laundered through the bank accounts of the shell companies, the accused claimed that he did not see the evidence related to these transactions, and merely forwarded the documents to Iho.

>> (ii)       The accused also disputed the Prosecution’s argument that he had reasonable grounds to believe that he was helping to facilitate Iho and Iho’s customers control of benefits of criminal conduct when he helped them open bank accounts to receive overseas fund transfers. Instead, he claimed that he was only providing a service to Iho by setting up the companies and bank accounts for a fee of between US$1,500 to US$5,000 per company, and that the four bank accounts (which were the subject matter of the CDSA charges) were set up to allow Iho’s customers in Europe to enjoy tax-free concessions in Singapore for one year.

>> (iii)       In addition, the accused claimed he had no reason to suspect Iho because until his arrest in Singapore, he did not face any problems with the authorities for his work with Iho.

19     For the purposes of these Grounds of Decision, I will deal first with the evidence and my findings for the forgery charges, before discussing the evidence and setting out my findings for the CDSA charges. I will then set out the reasons for the sentences imposed.

## (3)   The Forgery Charges

### (a)   Summary of the law and an overview of the Prosecution’s case

20     In respect of a charge under s 471 read with s 465 of the Penal Code, the following elements have to be established (see _Gunasegaran s/o Pavadaisamy v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 2 SLR(R) 946</span> at \[52\]):

> (a)     The document in question was forged;

> (b)     The offender used such a document;

> (c)     The offender used the document as genuine;

> (d)     The offender knew or had reason to believe that the document was forged.

21     Further, to prove that the accused abetted the commission of the above offences by intentionally aiding the foreign directors of Birseltex and Plutusteam i.e. to prove the s 471 read with s 465 PC Penal Code read with s 109 charge charges, it must be shown that[^9]:

> (a)     The accused facilitated the commission of the forgery offences by the foreign directors; and

> (b)     He intended to aid or facilitate the commission of such offences.

22     In the present case, the forgery charges related to the opening of accounts of two companies in two separate banks. Specifically, of the 22 forgery charges:

> (a)     9 charges involved forged documents used to support the opening of Birseltex DBS Account; and

> (b)     13 forged charges related to the use of documents for the opening of Plutusteam UOB Account.

23     In court, the accused did not dispute that the documents used to support the bank applications for Birseltex and Botitex were actually forged documents and that they had been used to open the respective bank accounts.[^10] However, he claimed that he did not know that they were forged documents at the time they were used for this purpose.

24     I will set out the evidence for each of the two sets of forgery charges.

### (b)   Forgery Charges relating to the opening of Birseltex DBS Account

25     A total of 9 purportedly forged documents were provided for the opening of the Birseltex DBS accounts in Singapore. The details of the documents are summarised below.[^11]

#### (i)   The 9 documents were forged documents and the accused knew this

26     The Prosecution alleged that the 9 documents (connected with Cim Jack Trading) that were provided to DBS bank in support of the opening of the Birseltex DBS Account were forged. Specifically, they were false documents[^12] because:

> (a)     Cim Jack Trading, was not in fact run by Birsel Cimen, with the contact details as stated; and

> (b)     The documents were made fraudulently by Iho and his customers, with the intention of causing it to be believed that such documents were made by the authority of a person by whose authority they knew that it was not made.

27     Having assessed the exhibits, including the accused’s statements, chat logs and other evidence adduced, and also the submissions made, I agreed with the Prosecution that the 9 documents were indeed forged documents, and that the accused was aware of this when he provided them to the foreign director, Birsel Cimen, to be given to DBS. In this respect:

> (a)     The accused admitted in his statements that Ms Birsel Cimen, who was named as the foreign director, was merely registered and paid to be named as a director of the company,[^13] and that someone else was running the company.10 The accused knew that she was merely a nominee, and not genuinely the business owner of Birseltex. Also, he knew that company in Europe called Cim Jack Trading actually “does not belong to \[her\]”.[^14]

> (b)     In the case of Birseltex, the evidence in the accused’s Whatsapp chat logs showed that it was Iho who had access to the e-mail address and other information of Birseltex[^15] rather than Birsel Cimen. Also, that the telephone number of Birseltex was used by Iho or his customers rather than Birsel Cimen. This showed that the company was not independently run by Birsel Cimen, but controlled by third parties including Iho.

> (c)     Thus, the documents that purportedly showed that Birsel Cimen was the person who was running the company, and the contact details corresponding to Birsel Cimen, were all false. In fact, the accused admitted that the registered addresses of the foreign directors were “fake addresses”, and that the telephone numbers of the directors were “also fake”.[^16] The accused further knew that the named foreign directors did not control or run the companies.[^17]

> (d)     In addition, the accused knew that it was Iho and his customers who created the forged documents,[^18] and who had prepared Cim Jack Trading’s registered address, phone number, e-mail, address, website, the invoices that it purportedly issued and received, and the bank transactions.[^19] In fact, it was Iho who had sent these documents from different e-mail addresses,[^20] including from galstonex99@gmail.com, to the accused’s e-mail rushdi@mail.ru.[^21] In this regard, the accused confirmed that Iho communicated with him using galstonex99@gmail.com.[^22]

> (e)     Further, the accused stated that it was Iho had who had sent him originals of the documents by courier, close to the date of the bank meetings, for the purpose of opening bank accounts in Singapore.[^23] The accused also said that Iho had provided him with the relevant invoices “to show the bank that Birsel has a business in Germany”.[^24] In addition, the accused claimed that “…maybe Iho was in a hurry and did not have time to re-register the companies so they used fake documents to open bank accounts in Singapore”.[^25] Further, the accused explained that the foreign director’s role was “…just to show the bank that \[the\] foreign director have a business overseas in order to open a bank account using invoices of their businesses overseas”.[^26]

28     Thus, in essence, the accused had admitted that:

> (a)     The foreign directors were merely lending their names as directors of the shell companies Birseltex and Plutusteam, and did not run the business as purported in the forged documents.[^27]

> (b)     It was Iho who had instructed him to set up the shell companies in Singapore and open corporate bank accounts in the name of these shell companies, for which the accused would be paid a sum of USD1,500 per company that he incorporated.[^28]

> (c)     It was Iho who had provided the forged documents. He was also the one who used and controlled the shell companies,[^29] and

> (d)     It was Iho and Iho’s customers who exercised control over the bank accounts of the shell companies as they had access to the emails, and they controlled the Internet banking access through the SIM cards.[^30]

29     Aside from his statements, the chat logs between the accused and Iho (Exhibit P47) also showed that they had an arrangement for Iho to create invoices and documents to support the opening of bank accounts in Singapore, and to supply these to the accused. As could be seen from these records:

> (a)     The accused asked Iho for invoices on 17 August 2016 at 21:51:36, stating that “without invoices \[can’t\], **just create one** and send them will do” (emphasis added).

> (b)     The accused made a further request to Iho on 8 September 2016 at 23:46:44 stating that: “About Loltina and Marian, just need two invoices and two orders to suppliers”. Iho responded at 23:47:23 stating: “Ok tell me what business they are in”.

> (c)     Iho also responded to the accused on 13 September 2016 at 21:21:26 stating: “Yes \[I\] \[am\] sending invoices etc…” in response to the accused’s request for invoices to provide explanations to the bank in relation to the “suspected payment” (see 13 September 2016 at 21:20:59 message from the accused).

30     In short, based on the accused’s statements and the chat logs, the 9 documents which constituted the supporting documents for the opening of the Birseltex DBS account, were made fraudulently by Iho (and his customers). They were also created for the sole purpose of the bank account opening applications in Singapore by deceiving DBS into believing that there was business being conducted by Cim Jack Trading under its purported director, Birsel Cimen. These were all facts that the accused and Iho knew were false.

#### (ii)   The accused intentionally aided the foreign director of Birseltex to fraudulently use the forged documents as genuine

31     The accused had passed the forged documents to Birsel Cimen[^31] for her to represent to the bank that she was genuinely running the business Cim Jack Trading, so she could open a bank account in Singapore for Birseltex.

32     Magdalene confirmed that Birsel Cimen did use the documents (which the accused had passed to her) at the DBS bank account opening meeting with the DBS relationship manager.[^32] Magdalene further stated that she had confirmed with Birsel Cimen that the supporting documents (Exhibits P74 to P82) were really provided by Birsel Cimen herself, and that if she have found out that any of the supporting documents were forged, DBS would **not** have opened an account for Birsel Cimen because it showed the customer did not have integrity and the bank “…wouldn’t want to do business with such a person”.[^33] Thus, relying on the forged supporting documents in Exhibits P74 to P82 provided by the accused, Birsel Cimen had successfully defrauded DBS bank into opening the Birseltex DBS account.

33     Thus, in light of the above evidence, I agreed with the Prosecution that the 9 forgery charges (4th to 12th charges), in relation to the Birseltex DBS account were made out.

### (c)   Forgery Charges relating to the opening of Plutusteam UOB Account

34     As regards the second set of forgery charges, a total of 13 documents were provided for the opening of the Plutusteam UOB Account. These documents, purportedly forged, were the subject matter of a corresponding number of forgery charges involving this account. The documents are summarised below.[^34]

#### (i)   The 13 documents provided were forged and the accused knew this

35     The Prosecution alleged that the 13 documents (mostly connected with Avashoes Ltd) that were provided to UOB bank in support of the opening of the Plutusteam UOB Account were forged. Specifically, they are false documents as:[^35]

> (a)     Avashoes Ltd was not in fact run by Harmanna Manger, with the contact details as stated; and

> (b)     They were made fraudulently by Iho and his customers, with the intention of causing it to be believed that such documents were made by the authority of a person by whose authority they knew that it was not made.

36     As with the earlier set of 9 charges, much of the evidence for these second set of 13 charges came from the accused himself in the form of admissions that he had made in his statements, or from the contents of his chat logs. Together they constituted damning evidence against him showing that the documents provided to UOB were false and that he was aware of this. In this respect:

> (a)     The accused admitted in his statements that Ms Harmanna Manger was referred to him by a friend Loltina, whom he then referred to Iho. Iho had paid Harmanna Manger USD2,000 in return for using her particulars to register as the foreign director for a company in Singapore, Plutusteam, and had also paid for her hotel accommodation and airfare to come to Singapore (which the accused had arranged).[^36]The accused knew that Harmanna Manger was merely registered in name as the director of a purported company Avashoes Ltd in Germany, but that she did not run the said company, and that this was done to show that she had a business somewhere.[^37] Thus, the documents which purportedly showed that Harmanna Manger was running Avashoes Ltd, and the contact details represented to be hers, were false.

> (b)     In fact, the accused admitted that the contact details corresponding to Harmanna Manger’s purported company, Avashoes Ltd, did not belong to her nor was the company controlled by her. Instead, the accused himself had helped Iho obtain the telephone number from Germany, where he had asked his friend there to buy SIM cards, and to send them to Iho in Lebanon where they were used, not by the foreign directors, but by Iho or Iho’s customers.[^38] Similarly, the e-mail address, “info@avashoes.org”, and registered address, “Samer Kafo, G/F, Plattenacker Strasse 2a, 96450 Coburg”, did not belong to Harmanna Manger,[^39] as it was the accused who had set up the e-mail account for Avashoes Ltd,[^40] and Iho who had provided the registered address, which the accused himself thought were “fake addresses”.[^41]

> (c)     The accused admitted that Harmanna Manger was not running Avashoes Ltd, but that she was merely registered as a director in name, to show that she had a business somewhere.[^42] Further, the accused admitted that the 13 documents in these set of charges were all provided to the accused by Iho, who “…was the one who had prepared all these documents”, and emailed them to the accused. [^43] Iho had also sent the accused originals of these documents closer to the bank meeting between Harmanna Manger and the bank staff.[^44] The accused just chose to follow Iho’s instructions,[^45] even though he stated that he did not know how Iho and his customers obtained the documents, or where they were obtained from.[^46] In addition, the accused said that he did not “concentrate on these kind of details” to ensure that Avashoes Ltd was a genuine business.[^47]

> (d)     Further, it could be seen from the chat logs between the accused and Iho that they obviously had an arrangement for Iho to create invoices and documents to support the opening of bank accounts, and to supply them to the accused.[^48] In addition, the accused had written to Iho on 31 August 2016 to inform him concerning the “(o)ld documents for some updates” in respect of Harmanna’s case.[^49] These chat logs showed not only that the accused knew that Iho was involved in the creation and could “update” (modify) the documents, but the accused himself was actively involved in asking Iho for them to be “updated”.

37     Indeed, as with the earlier set of 9 documents for the Birseltex DBS account, the accused admitted that “maybe Iho was in a hurry and did not have time to re-register the companies so they used faked documents to open bank accounts in Singapore.”[^50] To him, the foreign director’s role was “just to show the bank that \[the\] foreign director have a business overseas in order to open a bank account using invoices of their businesses overseas”.[^51]

#### (ii)   The accused abetted by intentionally aided the foreign director of Plutusteam to fraudulently use the forged documents as genuine

38     The accused admitted that he passed the 13 documents to the foreign director, Harmanna Manger,[^52] for the latter to use as genuine by representing to UOB that she was running the business Avashoes Ltd, so as “to show that she has a business somewhere and she is opening a company in Singapore as a branch to expand her business”[^53]. This was so that she could open a bank account.

39     These documents were in fact used by Harmanna Manger[^54] at the bank account opening meeting with the UOB relationship manager PW10 Ms Amelia Teo (“Ms Teo”). Ms Teo testified that she had confirmed with Harmanna Manger that the supporting documents (Exhibits P53 to P65) were really provided by Harmanna Manger herself, to prove that she had an existing company in Germany with ongoing business[^55]. Ms Teo testified that had she found out that any of the supporting documents were forged, UOB would not have opened an account for Harmanna Manger, but would instead have to flag up the case and “cease the business opening at all costs”.[^56]

40     Thus, based on the evidence adduced in court, Harmanna had successfully deceived UOB into opening the Plutusteam UOB account, and the accused had intentionally aided the commission of the s 471 read with s 465 Penal Code offences by knowingly supplying Harmanna Manger with the forged documents. In short, I accepted that the Prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused intentionally aided Harmanna Manger to commit offences under s 471 read with s 465 PC in respect of the 21st to 33rd charges.

### (d)   The accused’s denials of knowledge about the forged documents are not credible

41     While not denying the actus reus of the offences, the accused essentially took the positon that he was unaware that the documents were forged at the material time, and that his role was merely to receive the documents and forward them to the foreign directors to use. He claimed that he left it to “the accountant and the bank manager” to check the documents, and when they did not raise any objections, he understood that “everything \[was\] fine”;[^57]_i.e._ the documents were genuine. However, as rightly pointed out by the Prosecution, the accused’s claims were clearly unsupportable.

> (a)     First, the accused was himself involved in the recruitment of the various foreign nationals, when these same people had completely no involvement with the companies set out in the documents, or with the transactions referred to in them. The recruitment was carried out just so that the foreign nationals would be listed as the directors, and be linked with these shell companies for the sole purpose of opening bank accounts for Iho and his customers. These foreign nationals were rewarded just for the use of their names and their involvement in ‘convincing’ the local banks that they were genuine directors of these companies, when this was not the case. In such a situation, the accused clearly knew that the company documents used by the foreign nationals to “convince” the banks were bogus to begin with, as the named “directors” were not even genuine.

> (b)     Next, the accused’s arrangement with Iho was that they would modify the documents when there were ‘updates’ required. This could be seen from the accused’s chat logs with Iho, where the accused had informed Iho that “**we** have to change all documents”. The relevant chat logs are reproduced below:

(emphasis added)

> (c)     Finally, whether or not Darrel, the bank relationship managers, or any other person involved in the opening of the accounts, did or did not check the supporting documents was completely irrelevant. In the first place, the accused should not even have provided the forged documents to the foreign directors that he had brought to Singapore for the opening of the bank accounts.

42     In short, the evidence clearly established both the actus reus and mens rea of the offences in respect of all the forgery charges against the accused.

## (4)   The CDSA charges

43     In respect of the 8 CDSA charges, the accused was alleged to have engaged in a conspiracy with Iho and his Iho’s customers, to receive and transfer benefits of criminal conduct of these persons. These benefits allegedly arose from foreign serious offences, primarily email fraud (equivalent to cheating under s 420 PC), committed in three countries, namely Australia, Bermuda and Indonesia. Pursuant to the conspiracy, the accused had assisted in opening several bank accounts in Singapore for this purpose.

45     As regards the CDSA charges, the Prosecution’s case was as follows:[^58]

> (a)     Aside from the bank accounts that the accused had helped to set up in Singapore for Birseltex and Plutusteam, there were 2 other companies where bank accounts had been set up, namely Glidertex in Singapore, and Botitex in Hong Kong. All 4 companies had bank accounts in Singapore, and the accused was assisted by Darrel of DM Advisory in the incorporation of the 4 companies, as well as in the setting up of bank accounts in Singapore.

> (b)     In all cases, the accused knew that the companies’ accounts were controlled by Iho and his customers, and he also arranged for Iho to have access to the Internet banking devices of the 4 companies’ bank accounts, so that Iho could control these bank accounts from outside Singapore.

> (c)     These 4 companies’ accounts received benefits of criminal conduct consisting of 8 fund transfers made by four victims based overseas (Bermuda, Australia and Indonesia) arising from e-mail fraud perpetrated against the victims through the use of spoofed and compromised e-mail accounts by unknown fraudsters. The e-mail fraud – equivalent to the offence of cheating under s 420 of the PC – satisfies the definition of “foreign serious offence” in s 2(1) of the CDSA.

46     The accused admitted that the moneys received into the 4 companies’ bank accounts from the overseas victims constitute proceeds of crime. His defence, however, was that he did not know at the time that they were proceeds of crime.

### (a)   Summary of the law and the elements that had to be proved

47     For the 8 CDSA charges against the accused (famed under s 44(1)(a) and punishable under s 44(5)(a) of the CDSA read with s 108B and s 109 of the PC), the Prosecution needs to show that the accused conspired with Iho and his customers to commit the offence, and that an act was carried out in pursuance of the conspiracy. In addition, the elements of a s 44(1)(a) offence have to be made out.

##### Proof of conspiracy

48     As regards proof of conspiracy, one method is to show that the words and actions of the accused persons indicate their concert in the pursuit of a common object or design, giving rise to the inference that their actions must have been coordinated by arrangement beforehand.[^59] Further, it has been held that “…although there must be knowledge of a common design, it is not necessary that all of the co-conspirators be equally informed as to the details. However, they must at least be aware of the general purpose of the plot and the plot must be unlawful. The test of guilt is not what was the object of the offender, but whether having regard to the immediate object of the instigation or conspiracy, the act done by the principal is one which according to ordinary experience and common sense, the abettor must have seen as foreseeable.”[^60]

##### Proof of the elements of s 44(1)(a) CDSA

49     As for proof of an offence under s 44(1)(a), the decision of VK Rajah JA in _Ang Jeanette v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 1</span> (“_Jeanette Ang_”) is particularly instructive.

50     On the issue of actus reus, his Honour had stated the following at \[49\]:

> “…Therefore, to make out an offence under s 44(1)(_a_), the Prosecution must prove as part of the _actus reus_ that:

>> (a)    the accused has entered or is otherwise concerned in an arrangement;

>> (b)    which (i) facilitates the retention or control by or on behalf of another (“that other person”) of (ii) that other person’s benefits of criminal conduct; and

>> (c)    that other person is a person who engages in or has engaged in criminal conduct or has benefited from criminal conduct.”

51     As for the mens rea element, as could be seen from \[72\] of _Jeanette Ang_, it has to be shown that:

> (a)     The accused had reasonable grounds to believe that the arrangement would facilitate the retention and control of such benefits of criminal conduct; and

> (b)     The accused had reasonable grounds to believe that other person had engaged in criminal conduct or had benefited from it.

52     The following definitions in section 2 of the CDSA should also be noted:

> \-    “Criminal conduct” means “doing or being concerned in, whether in Singapore or elsewhere, any act constituting a serious offence or a foreign serious offence”.

> \-    “Foreign serious offence” (a) means “an offence (other than a foreign drug dealing offence) against the law of a foreign country or part thereof that consists of or includes conduct which, if the conduct had occurred in Singapore, would have constituted a serious offence” .

> \-    “Serious offence” (a) means any of the offences specified in the Second Schedule to the CDSA. For our present purposes, this includes an offence under s 420 PC (cheating and dishonestly inducing a delivery of property).

53     Further, VK Rajah JA made clear at \[58\] of _Jeanette Ang_ that as regards the predicate offence from which the benefits are derived:

> “There is nothing in that provision that requires or points to any need to impose on the Prosecution the heavy and impractical burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt the crime or class of crime that may constitute the predicate offence.

> …it is not necessary for the Prosecution to satisfy the court beyond a reasonable doubt that all the constituent elements of a specific offence listed in the Second Schedule have been met…It is, however, necessary for the Prosecution to adduce some evidence linking the moneys in question with particular criminal conduct, _ie_, some act that may constitute one or other of the offences (or classes thereof) listed in the Second Schedule, from which the moneys dealt with in an arrangement under s 44(1)(_a_) are derived, and in which the other person is engaged or has engaged, or from which he has benefited.

> … Equally, circumstances could well arise where the only logical inference to any reasonable person is that the moneys involved in the arrangement are criminal property, and that the other person engages in, or has engaged in, or has benefited from, criminal conduct.”

54     Thus, in line with the above propositions of law, I agreed with the Prosecution that there is no requirement for the Prosecution to prove the predicate (foreign) offence beyond a reasonable doubt. It is sufficient for the Prosecution to adduce some evidence that a foreign serious offence had occurred in Australia, Bermuda and Indonesia, and that it consists of, or includes, conduct which would have constituted a serious offence (in this case cheating under s 420 PC), if the conduct had occurred in Singapore.

55     As regards proving the occurrence of the foreign predicate offence in each CDSA charge, which would necessarily require evidence of the foreign law that had allegedly been breached, I was satisfied that such evidence can be adduced through the production of copies of electronic documents that are set out on the official website of the government of that foreign country government of its laws. Such an approach is in line with s 53(1)(b) of the CDSA.[^61]

56     With the above principles established, I will now deal with the evidence adduced for the CDSA charges.

### (b)   Evidence that benefits of criminal conduct were received

57     It was the Prosecution’s case that benefits of criminal conduct, arising from foreign serious offences, namely email fraud (cheating) committed against overseas victims, had been transferred into the Glidertex, Plutusteam, Birseltex and Botitex bank accounts.

58     To prove the commission of the foreign serious offences, evidence was led through:

> (a)     The Bermudan victim, PW2 Ms Astoria Michelle Edwards (“Ms Edwards”) involving funds transferred to Birseltex DBS Account,

> (b)     Representatives of the Australian victim, Paccon Logistics Pty Ltd, PW3 Mr Jacob Peter Martin De Bock (“Mr De Bock”), and PW6 Mr Geoffrey Nicholls (“Mr Nicholls”) involving funds transferred to Glidertex UOB Account,

> (c)     Affidavits tendered through the Investigation Officer, PW8 Chew Min, relating to the transfer of funds from representative of the Australian victim, Cardioscan Pty Ltd into Birseltex DBS Account, and from representatives of the Indonesian victim, PT Maskapai Pelayaran Pulau Laut into Botitex DBS Account, and Plutusteam UOB Account.

59     The foreign witnesses’ evidence, and the evidence of the foreign laws, were essentially not disputed. I have summarised the main aspects of the evidence below.

#### (i)   Criminal benefits from Bermuda received into Birseltex DBS Account[^62]

60     Ms Edwards testified that she was cheated through emails (see exhibit P11) that she received that were purportedly sent by her friend Joan Dillas-Wright. It appears that someone had masqueraded as Joan, and had caused Ms Edwards to make three transfers of funds to Birseltex DBS account, namely: USD 4,978.59 on 14 September 2016, USD 10,750 on 14 September 2016, and USD 5,000 on 16 September 2016. Ms Edwards subsequently lodged a police report in Bermuda (Exhibit P12), wherein she stated that she had received e-mails from her friend Joan who used “jdwright@logic.bm”, requesting that she wire her moneys. The total funds stolen in this manner amounted to USD 20,750.

61     Evidence from PW7 Supt Abdul Murad Bin Abdul Latiff (“Supt Murad”) of the TCFB, who analysed the e-mails in Exhibit P11, also concluded that they had been sent from a compromised e-mail account in Nigeria, and not from Joan in Bermuda.[^63]

62     It was thus clear that based on the evidence adduced, an offence of obtaining property by deception under s 345(1) of the Bermuda Criminal Code 1907 (see exhibit P112) had been committed. The conduct which pertained to that serious foreign offence would have constituted an offence under s 420 PC had it occurred in Singapore. In short, I agreed that the Prosecution had shown that the transfers made into the Birseltex DBS account by Ms Edwards were benefits of criminal conduct.

#### (ii)   Criminal benefits from Australia received into Glidertex UOB Account[^64]

63     Two representatives for the Australian victim (Paccon Logistics Pty Ltd), Mr De Bock, and Mr Nicholls, testified that AUD 198,916.49 (equivalent to USD 151,136.75) were received into the Glidertex UOB account on 23 August 2016, and that the transfer was made pursuant to fraudulent e-mails purportedly sent from “pdebock@paccon.com” (Exhibit P15). These emails were fraudulent since Mr De Bock had not in fact sent the e-mails. Mr Nicholls subsequently lodged a police report dated 25 August 2016 (Exhibit P13) about this matter.

64     Their evidence was corroborated by Supt Murad who, on analysis of the e-mails sent from “pdebock@paccon.com”, concluded that they had been sent from a spoofed e-mail account i.e. these messages originated from someone or somewhere other than the actual e-mail source.[^65] Specifically, the e-mails originated not from Australia, where Mr De Bock was based, but from locations in Great Britain, Nigeria and United States of America.

65     Based on the above evidence, an offence of fraud under s 192E(1) of the New South Wales Crimes Act 1900 No 40 has been committed, whereby a person(s) had impersonated Mr De Bock in order to deceive Paccon Logistics into transferring AUD 198,916.49 into the Glidertex UOB account, causing that person(s) to thereby dishonestly obtain property that belonged to Paccon Logistics. The conduct which pertained to that serious foreign offence would have constituted an offence under s 420 PC had it occurred in Singapore.

66     I was thus satisfied that it had successfully been shown that USD 151,136.75 of criminal benefits was transferred by Paccon Logistics Pty Ltd into Glidertex UOB account on 23 August 2016 as alleged in the charge.

#### (iii)   Criminal benefits from Australia received into Birseltex DBS account[^66]

67     An affidavit from Mr Jan Marcel-Gielen (“Mr Gielen”), dated 30 January 2019, with accompanying annexes (Exhibit P48), was admitted through IO Chew Min. Mr Gielen was a representative of another Australian victim, Cardioscan Pty Ltd.

68     The affidavit was admitted as:

> (a)     It satisfied the conditions set out in s 262(1)(b) of the CPC, having been sworn in the requisite manner;

> (b)     The conditions set out in s 32(1)(j) of the Evidence Act have also been established, since the maker of the statement was shown to be “… outside Singapore and it is not practicable to secure his attendance”. In this respect, Mr Gielen had informed IO Chew Min that he was unwilling to travel to Singapore to testify at the criminal trial; [^67] and

> (c)     There was no reason to exclude such evidence.

69     In his affidavit, Mr Gielen had explained how Cardioscan was deceived into making a transfer to the Birseltex DBS account on 6 September 2016. Essentially, believing that e-mails were genuinely sent by one Carol Wen of Biomedical Instruments, Mr Gielen had authorised Cardioscan to make a transfer of USD 38,999 on 6 September 2016 to Birseltex DBS account.[^68] Later, realising Cardioscan had been scammed, Mr Gielen lodged a statutory declaration at the Malvern Police Station in Victoria, Australia, dated 15 September 2016,[^69] and reported the matter to the CAD as well.[^70]

70     Based on the evidence given by Mr Gielen, an offence of obtaining property by deception under s 81(1) of the Victoria Crimes Act 1958 has been committed, as Mr Gielen had been deceived by a person(s) impersonating Carol Wen of Biomedical Instruments using the e-mail “global@bi-biiomed.com”, into authorising the transfer of USD 38,999 on 6 September 2016 from Cardioscan to the Birseltex DBS account, causing that person(s) to thereby dishonestly obtain property that belonged to Cardioscan.

71     Similar with the offence involving Paccon Logistics, this foreign serious offence includes conduct which, if it had occurred in Singapore, would have constituted a serious offence under the CDSA, namely cheating under s 420 PC. I was thus satisfied that it had successfully been shown that USD 38,999 of criminal benefits was transferred by Cardioscan on 6 September 2016 to Birseltex DBS account as alleged in the charge.

#### (iv)   Criminal benefits from Indonesia received into Plutusteam UOB account and Botitex DBS account.[^71]

72     An affidavit from one Mr Doni Yanuwardhana (“Mr Yanuwardhana”), who represents the Indonesian victim, PT Maskapai, was tendered. Mr Yanuwardhana had stated in an affidavit dated 13 February 2019, that he did not wish to travel to Singapore to testify at the criminal trial because he was presently engaged in PT Maskapai’s operations which required his presence overseas for a business trip.[^72] This affidavit is admissible as it satisfied the conditions set out in s 262(1)(c) of the CPC, and section 32 EA.

73     Based on the contents of this affidavit, as well as the evidence of Norhaza, an employee of PT Maskapai’s business partner, Eng Lee Shipping, it was clear that PT Maskapai was deceived through fraudulent emails purportedly sent by Norhaza from marketing@englee.com.sg. These fraudulent emails requested for payments to be made to the Plutusteam UOB account and Botitex DBS accounts, even though both accounts were not actually associated with Eng Lee Shipping.[^73]

74     Through these fraudulent emails, the following transfers were made:

> (a)     PT Maskapai transferred USD 48,500 to the Plutusteam UOB account on 18 August 2016;

> (b)     PT Maskapai transferred USD 31,000 to the Botitex DBS account on 7 September 2016; and

> (c)     PT Maskapai transferred USD 37,450 to the Plutusteam UOB account on 29 September 2016.

75     Subsequently, on 5 October 2016, staff at PT Maskapai discovered that the company was a victim of fraud when they received an e-mail dated 5 October 2016 at 7.47p.m. from Norhaza requesting for payments on the three outstanding invoices. On 10 October 2016, Mr Yanuwardhana, lodged a police report in Singapore stating that he was a victim of fraud. He also stated that he was informed by Norhaza that her e-mail “marketing@englee.com.sg” was hacked between 11 August 2016 to 27 September 2016, and that Eng Lee Shipping never requested payments to be made to the Plutusteam UOB and Botitex DBS accounts.

76     In court, Norhaza testified that she did not know who had used her e-mail account or had sent the e-mails which PT Maskapai relied on to make the three payments to bank accounts that were not associated with Eng Lee Shipping.[^74]

77     The evidence of Mr Yanuwardhana and Norhaza was corroborated by Supt Murad who testified that the e-mails purportedly sent from marketing@englee.com.sg by Norhaza to PT Maskapai, were sent from a spoofed e-mail account, and that they actually originated from an IP address located in Nigeria. His evidence confirmed that Norhaza did not sent the fraudulent emails which deceived PT Maskapai into making the bank transfers to the Plutusteam UOB and Botitex DBS accounts.

78     Thus, an offence of fraud under Article 378 of the Penal Code of Indonesia had been committed by an unknown person who impersonated Norhaza to successfully induce PT Maskapai into making the three transfers. This fraud amounts to a foreign serious offence, and includes conduct, which, if it had occurred in Singapore, would have constituted a “serious offence” i.e. an offence under s 420 PC. Accordingly, I agreed that the transfers made into the Plutusteam UOB and Botitex DBS accounts by PT Maskapai were benefits of criminal conduct.

79     It should also be noted that the evidence of all the victims were not challenged by the accused, and I saw no reason not to give full weight to them, as they were consistent, credible and corroborated by other witnesses and/or the results of the TCFB investigations. Accordingly, I was satisfied that all 8 transfers of monies (referred to in the CDSA charges) into the accounts of Glidertex, Plutusteam, Birseltex and Botitex were benefits of criminal conduct within the meaning set out in the CDSA.

### (c)   The accused was concerned in an arrangement that facilitated the control by Iho and his customers of their benefits of criminal conduct

80     Based on ICA screening records,[^75] between 16 May 2016 and 25 October 2016, the accused came to Singapore on three occasions. On the first two occasions, he spent a few weeks bringing foreign directors here for interviews with the banks for the account openings.

81     On Iho’s instructions, once the bank accounts were opened, the accused had forwarded the Internet banking tokens to Lebanon, and addressed them to ‘Ihab Khalil’ (i.e. Iho).[^76] Iho also had full access to the contact details corresponding to the foreign directors of the companies – the e-mail addresses and phone numbers - with the latter being required to access the one time passwords (“OTPs’) for every banking transaction in the respective accounts.[^77] The e-mail addresses were also required so the bank would be able to communicate with the relevant customer named for the account.

82     By giving all the key banking information and devices to Iho, including the bank account information, the Internet banking tokens, the phone number and the email address connected to the bank accounts, the accused allowed Iho and his customers to control the bank accounts from overseas. Further, when the banks corresponded with the “foreign directors”, they were actually corresponding with Iho or his customers.

83     The bank accounts of Glidertex, Plutusteam, Birseltex and Botitex also received funds from overseas that were benefits of criminal conduct (see \[59\] – \[78\] above). I agreed that since Iho and his customers controlled the bank accounts, essentially such benefits of criminal conduct belonged to them. In short, by the accused’s actions in helping to open the bank accounts, and then aiding Iho and his customers to control them, the accused had facilitated the control by Iho and his customers of their benefits of criminal conduct.

### (d)   The requisite mens rea: proof of reasonable grounds to believe

84     For the CDSA charges, as with the forgery charges, the main dispute again concerned whether the accused had the requisite mens rea, since the accused conceded that the amounts transferred into the Glidertex, Birseltex, Plutusteam and Botitex bank accounts were benefits of criminal conduct of Iho and his customers.[^78] Specifically, the question was whether the accused had reasonable grounds to believe that by the arrangement, he would facilitate the control of Iho and his customers’ benefits of criminal conduct, and also whether the accused had reasonable grounds to believe that Iho and his customers had engaged in criminal conduct (see \[51\] above).

85     In this regard, as regards the law in relation to reasonable grounds to believe, VK Rajah JA in _Jeanette Ang_ had explained at \[70\] that:

> “…it would perhaps be useful, at this juncture, to reiterate briefly the local case law on the meaning of “reasonable grounds to believe”. In _Ow Yew Beng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 1 SLR(R) 536</span>, the High Court held (at \[10\]) that having “reason to believe” involved a “lesser degree of conviction than certainty but a higher one than speculation”. **In applying the test, the court must assume the position of the actual individual involved (ie, including his knowledge and experience), but must reason (ie, infer from the facts known to such individual) from that position like an objective reasonable man** (see _Koh Hak Boon v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] 2 SLR(R) 733</span> at \[13\] and _PP v Wang Ziyi Abl_e <span class="citation">\[2008\] 2 SLR(R) 61</span> at \[87\]).”

\[emphasis added\]

86     In the context of the present case, the issue was whether an objective reasonable man (with the subjective knowledge and experience of the accused) had reasonable grounds to believe that the arrangement would facilitate the retention of Iho and his customers’ benefits of criminal conduct, and that Iho and his customers had engaged in criminal conduct. After assessing the evidence, I was of the view that the requisite mens rea of the accused had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

87     Specifically, on the issue of whether the accused had reasonable grounds to believe that Iho and Iho’s customers had engaged in criminal conduct, I was satisfied that this had been established. In this regard:

> (a)     The accused would have been suspicious that Iho wanted to control corporate bank accounts in Singapore using nominees and shell companies, when he himself has no business or presence in Singapore. In fact, the accused admitted that it did “sometimes” cross his mind that something was wrong with this arrangement, when Iho was not listed as a director of these companies.[^79]

> (b)     In addition, the accused admitted that he was worried that Iho may use the companies for “improper things”.[^80] He also admitted that he suspected that Iho went by a fake name “Ihab” (i.e. Ihab Khalil).[^81] Yet despite his suspicions, the accused allegedly just kept these concerns to himself. He further admitted that he did not ask Iho further about the use of accounts so long as the companies could be incorporated with the bank accounts open.[^82] Clearly, the accused was only interested in the fees he would receive for recruiting foreign directors for opening the accounts, and deliberately ignored all the obvious tell-tale signs that something was amiss.

> (c)     When the accused was asked why Iho’s customers would not use their own names to open bank accounts, the accused claimed that Iho had told him that his customers would only use the companies and bank accounts for one year, as the first year was tax-free.[^83] However, the accused’s claim was hardly credible since there was no evidence presented by him that Singapore-incorporated companies enjoyed tax-free treatment for the first year. Specifically, other than making a convenient but bare assertion that a corporate service provider named “Dean” had told him this, the accused admitted that he had not checked if this claim was true.[^84] Neither was “Dean” called (whether with the assistance of the CAD or otherwise) as a defence witness to back up the accused’s assertion.

> (d)     In fact, as pointed out by the Prosecution, the accused was also inconsistent on this position. In this regard:

>> (i)       In his testimony on 24 July 2019, the accused claimed to know that the practice used by Iho and his customers to run companies to make a “bypass” of moneys to Singapore so they “\[would\] get lesser taxes”, was “not legal”.[^85]

>> (ii)       Yet, during his cross-examination on 6 August 2019, he contradicted himself by claiming that he did not know that such bypassing of taxes was illegal.[^86] He subsequently went on to claim that a tax offence which was not legal, was not a crime,[^87] and that the difference between the two was that an offence was a “small mistake”, but a crime was a “big mistake”.[^88]

>> (iii)       Clearly, the accused was playing with words. Indeed, even by his own admission, he knew that what Iho and his customers were doing was “not legal”, but he nonetheless joined in, only to attempt to downplay the criminal nature of his actions when confronted in court.

> (e)     Even when queries were posed by the banks on suspicious transactions linked to these accounts, the accused did not asked Iho about these matters. This could be seen from the chat logs between the accused and Darrel, when the suspicions of the banks were highlighted to the accused (emphasis in bold added).

> (f)     The accused also did not take any steps after Darrel told him that the DBS banker, Magdalene, had advised that the accused tell his clients to use the accounts “properly and legitimately”.[^89] Instead, the accused said that he found Magdalene to be “an annoying manager”.[^90] Indeed in court, the accused agreed that Darrel had told him the DBS accounts were suspected to be “used for illegal purpose and for sham”,[^91] but he said that he did not tell Iho or check whether they were used for legitimate purposes. Instead, his response was that the bank was annoying and overreacting.[^92]

> (g)     Further, based on the chat logs, when the accused did tell Iho that there were complaints from the bank,[^93] his interest was only to ask for supporting documents to allay the bank managers’ concerns over the use of the bank accounts, rather than in checking if they were actually used for legitimate transactions. Apparently, his focus was simply to have forged documents prepared to address the concerns raised. Indeed, the logs revealed that rather than being manipulated by Iho, the accused was deeply involved in a plan to move benefits of criminal conduct from one account to another across borders whilst trying to mask the fact that money laundering was taking place. His communications with Iho were particularly telling.

(emphasis added)

88     Next, on the issue of whether the accused had reasonable grounds to believe that his arrangement with Iho and his customers would facilitate the control of their benefits of criminal conduct, I was also satisfied that this had also been proven. In this regard:

> (a)     Despite the accused’s worry that the accounts would be used for illegal activities, he took active steps to courier the Internet banking tokens to Iho, thereby giving Iho and his customers full control of the bank accounts.

> (b)     Further, when there were reports of fraudulent transactions in the bank accounts, the accused did not care about them.[^94] Instead, he was concerned with preventing the bank from freezing the accounts, and “not to let \[Iho\] waste money”.[^95] He admitted that he wanted Iho to “keep \[the money\] in his pocket and enjoy the money”.[^96]

> (c)     Even when the banks wanted to close the account, his concern was to withdraw the money, with the money going either to him personally,[^97] or to Darrel’s Smart Analytics bank account to hold the moneys for Iho.[^98] After these issues were settled, the accused continued to set up companies and open more bank accounts for Iho.

> (d)     Clearly, the accused’s actions indicated that he intended to, and did in fact, facilitate Iho and his customers’ control of what the accused reasonably believed were benefits of their criminal conduct.

89     Accordingly, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had successfully showed that the accused possessed the requisite mens rea in respect of all the CDSA charges.

90     All in all, in light of the clear and comprehensive evidence adduced, and the detailed arguments put up, I was of the view that the case against the accused had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt on all 30 proceeded charges, and I convicted him accordingly.

## (5)   Sentencing Phase

91     To recap, the accused had been convicted, after trial, on 30 charges consisting of 22 forgery charges and 8 CDSA charges.

92     Each forgery offence is punishable with imprisonment of up to 4 years, or with a fine, or both, while each CDSA offence is punishable with a fine not exceeding $500,000 or to imprisonment not exceeding 10 years, or to both.

93     The accused has no antecedent records in Singapore.

### (a)   Sentencing Position and Mitigation

94     As stated earlier, the accused initially did not consent to having the remaining 13 charges taken into consideration for sentencing. On that basis, the Prosecution had tendered a written submission on sentence seeking a global sentence of 90 months’ imprisonment. For this sentence, the Prosecution essentially based its submissions on the application of the sentencing principles of specific and general deterrence, arguing that this case involved the accused using the financial system in Singapore on multiple occasions to perpetrate transnational money laundering offences. The Prosecution also urged the court to take into account the reputational damage caused to Singapore as a clean and trusted financial hub.

95     As for the specific sentences sought, and the determination of the (initial) global term of 90 months’ imprisonment, the Prosecution argued that:

> (a)     For each forgery charge, the sentence should be 4 months’ imprisonment; and

> (b)     For the CDSA charges, because of the different amounts involved per charge, and based on the sentencing guidelines and the harm-culpability matrix set out by the High Court in _Huang Ying-Chun v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 606</span> (“_Huang_”), the Prosecution set out starting sentences for each CDSA charge, before moderating the recommended sentences to take into account the totality principle as follows:

> (c)     The Prosecution also submitted that because the accused had claimed trial to 30 charges, the global sentence should be 90 months’ imprisonment consisting of running the sentences for the two most serious CDSA charges, and the sentence for one of the forgery charges consecutively, as follows:

>> (i)       DAC-903288-2018: 54 months’ imprisonment;

>> (ii)       DAC-903289-2018: 32 months’ imprisonment; and

>> (iii)       DAC-903290-2018: 4 months’ imprisonment.

96     Subsequently, after having been given the opportunity to go through the Prosecution’s written submissions in detail, the accused indicated that he had changed his mind and was now willing to consent to have the 13 stood down charges taken into consideration for sentencing (TIC charges). The accused maintained this position even after the Prosecution indicated that instead of a global sentence of 90 months’ imprisonment, if the TIC charges were included the Prosecution would be seeking an additional 6 months’ imprisonment i.e. the Prosecution would ask for total of 96 months’ imprisonment, as the TIC charges involved an additional sum of USD $333,033.80 being laundered.[^99]

97     As for his mitigation plea, the accused essentially asked for mercy and for the “total sentence just to be reasonable for my situation”. He stated that he had waited for 1 ½ years for the investigation and wanted to go home. He also claimed that “Iho and his people” had manipulated him and had taken advantage of his naivety. Finally, he stated that he was not involved in the cheating of the people (in respect of the predicate offences).[^100]

### (b)   Court’s Decision on Sentencing

#### (i)   The forgery offences

98     As regards the 22 forgery charges, while rightly pointing out that sentences of 8 to 10 weeks’ imprisonment had been imposed on first-offenders who had pleaded guilty in cases where no monetary loss was caused,[^101] the Prosecution highlighted that the main sentencing principle for the forgery offences is deterrence (citing _Xia Qin Lai v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 4 SLR 343</span> at \[29\]). The DPPs argued that an uplift of the sentence to 4 months’ imprisonment per charge was justified due to the aggravated circumstances of the present case.

99     Having carefully evaluated the evidence and the submissions, I accepted that the use of the forged documents was clearly calculated to deceive the banks, and to circumvent the checks put in place to prevent the improper use of bank accounts in Singapore. Further, the elaborate ploy employed in the present case, which involved the creation and use of numerous forged documents, was one in which the accused played a critical role, and where he was very much engaged.

100    I further agreed that the forgery offences had undermined the confidence and integrity of our banking system. They were also a precursor to even more serious CDSA offences in which the accused and his accomplices were involved in, which themselves were part of a broader scheme where crimes were committed overseas against foreign victims, and the illicit gains of these foreign serious offences were then channelled to and collected in Singapore. In addition, I noted that the accused had shown no remorse throughout.

101    Finally, of his 13 TIC charges, 6 of them involved similar forgery offences. In this regard, in _PP v UI \[2008\] 4 SLR(R_), 500 (“_UI”_) Chan Sek Keong CJ (as he then was), in delivering the decision of the Court of Appeal, made clear how TIC offences should be regarded when sentencing an offender. At \[38\], his Honour had stated:

> “**But, if there are TIC offences to be taken into account, the effect, in general, would be that the sentence which the court would otherwise have imposed for the offences proceeded with would be increased** (see Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2003) at p 77). This is commonsensical as the offender, by agreeing to have the TIC offences in question taken into consideration for sentencing purposes, has in substance admitted that he committed those offences. **This would a fortiori be the case where the TIC offences and the offences proceeded with are similar in nature** (e.g., if both sets of offences consist of sexual offences against the same victim).”

\[emphasis mine\]

102    Thus, taking into account the more aggravated circumstances of the present case as compared to those set out in precedent cases, and noting the need for deterrence for such forgery offences, I was of the view that the suggested uplift was well justified. Accordingly, I imposed a sentence of 4 months’ imprisonment for each forgery charge.

#### (ii)   The CDSA offences

103    As for the CDSA charges, I considered the Prosecution’s submission that I should apply the sentencing framework in _Huang_. The _Huang_ framework, which had been established for the laundering of monies that were the proceeds of crimes committed in Singapore (see \[48\] of _Huang_), had itself used as a model the framework set out by Menon CJ in _Logachev Vladislav v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 609</span> (“_Logachev_”). The latter case involved a Russian National committing an offence of cheating punishable under s 172A(2) of the Casino Control Act.

104    In the present case, I agreed with the Prosecution that the _Huang_ framework, could similarly be used here, since both cases involved s 44(1)(a) CDSA charges. Moreover, the _Huang_ framework was, _inter alia_, intended to apply to persons who recruit cash runners. This was not dissimilar to the role played by the accused who had recruited and assisted foreign nationals to set up the bank accounts for money laundering. Finally, the _Huang_ framework was formulated for contested cases (see \[48\] and \[52\] in _Huang_), which was exactly the situation here. At the end of the day, since the CDSA is largely directed against money laundering offences in Singapore, I was of the view that whether the predicate offence occurred in or outside of Singapore, should not be an impediment to the application of the comprehensive 5-step sentencing framework set out in _Huang._

105    The _Huang_ framework is as follows (see \[100\] – \[105\] of _Huang_):

> (a)     Step 1:Identify the level of harm and culpability based on the offence- specific factors;

> (b)     Step 2: Identify the applicable indicative sentencing range;

> (c)     Step 3: Identify the appropriate starting point within the indicative sentencing range;

> (d)     Step 4: Adjust the starting point to take into account offender-specific factors; and

> (e)     Step 5: Make further adjustments to take into account the totality principle.

106    I now apply the above framework to the present case.

##### Step 1: Identify the level of harm and culpability based on the offence- specific factors (see \[98\] of _Huang_ )

107    As regards the issue of harm:

> (a)     The amount cheated from the victims pursuant to the predicate offences was substantial, totalling USD327,787.34, of which USD 66,226.85 was recovered due to the efforts of the Commercial Affairs Department (“CAD”).

> (b)     Further, as noted in _Huang_, where there is an involvement of a syndicate, and also where the offence involves a transnational element, all these factors would have a bearing on the assessment of the harm caused by the accused’s offences. In the present case, it was clear that there was a criminal syndicate involved in the predicate offences that were carried out against foreign victims. The illicit funds that resulted from the foreign serious offences committed were then challenged across borders into the Singaporean bank accounts that the accused had helped Iho and his customers set up. The accused was also actively involved in recruiting suitable European nationals to act as directors of shell companies, and in preparing them for the opening of bank accounts as part of an elaborate transnational ploy to facilitate money laundering. All these factors thus increased the harm caused by the accused’s actions.

> (c)     Finally, in the assessment of harm, I noted that such offences – involving the use of shell companies and the setting up of bank accounts for the sole purpose of money laundering – clearly have the potential to taint the image of our corporate structures and of our banking institutions, and to damage Singapore’s reputation as a trusted business and financial hub.

108    All in all, I agreed that the harm caused by the accused actions could be said to range from (at least) slight to moderate, depending on the amounts laundered through the bank accounts (USD4,978.59 to USD151,136.75) for the 9 charges.

109    Moving on to the issue of culpability, I took into account the following factors, many of which were also present and discussed in _Huang_ (at \[118\]-\[126\]).

> (a)     First, as set out in the evidence adduced, there was clear planning and premeditation displayed by the accused, who was very much involved in the money laundering offences. His extensive involvement could be seen from his actions in:

>> (i)       Recruiting suitable foreign directors and engaging with Darrel to incorporate shell companies in Singapore;

>> (ii)       Obtaining SIM cards and creating e-mail addresses purportedly as the foreign directors’ details to be listed in the bank account opening forms;

>> (iii)       Working with Iho to provide forged documents to the foreign directors to open bank accounts in Singapore;

>> (iv)       Arranging for the foreign directors to come to Singapore solely for the purpose of opening the bank accounts for the shell companies, and preparing them on how to falsely portray that they had ongoing businesses overseas to facilitate the opening of the bank accounts;

>> (v)       Once the bank accounts were opened, couriering Internet banking devices to Iho and his customers for their use; and

>> (vi)       When concerns were raised by the banks on fraudulent transactions in the bank accounts, working to address the concerns, or to protect the money by ensuring that they were transferred out before the bank accounts were frozen or closed.

> (b)     Second, the accused’s participation in the CDSA offences, at least in Singapore, was also of significant duration, extending from May 2016 when the Botitex DBS account was opened, to October 2016 upon the closure of the Glidertex UOB account. During this period, there were successful receipts of criminal proceeds into the 4 bank accounts on 8 occasions.

> (c)     Third, the entire scam was sophisticated and elaborate, involving not only extensive preparations for money laundering (through the setting up of shell companies and bank accounts), but also in the defrauding of foreign individuals and companies through the spoofing and compromising of e-mail accounts to deceive the victims into transferring money into the Singapore banks accounts. While there was no evidence that the accused was directly involved in the predicate offences, he at least played a pivotal role in ensuring that the criminal proceeds of those offences were collected in Singapore, and protected for Iho and his customers.

> (d)     Fourth, based on the accused’s own statements, on the occasions that he was in Singapore, his presence was for the sole purpose of facilitating and arranging for the foreign nationals to be picked up, and to be prepared to meet with the bank representatives to open the accounts used for money laundering. As with the offender in _Huang_, the accused “…remained in Singapore, as it were, for the sole purpose of committing crime. This factor raises the \[accused’s\] culpability” (as per See J in _Huang_ at \[124\]).

> (e)     Finally, the accused was solely motivated by financial gain, and admitted that he was paid for each company that he incorporated. He also showed no remorse and repeatedly insinuated that the CAD was out to get him.

110    All in all, in terms of culpability, I agreed that the accused should be assessed to be of high culpability.

##### Steps 2 and 3: The applicable indicative sentencing range and appropriate starting point

111    Based on the assessment of harm as slight/moderate, and culpability as high, the appropriate indicative sentencing range would then be from between 30 to 90 months’ imprisonment per charge (see \[102\] of _Huang_).

![]([2019] SGDC 0243_Image/[2019] SGDC 0243_image1.png)

112    Similar with the offender in _Huang_, the accused was not the only person involved in the offences. However, unlike Iho, the accused does not appear to be at the apex of the syndicate’s hierarchy.

113    In addition, in the present case, I noted that the accused had consented to 4 similar TIC charges that were CDSA offences. These represented an additional USD333,033.80 of criminal proceeds that were laundered. The effect of the TIC charges, as argued by the Prosecution and consistent with the position set out in _PP v UI_ (see \[101\] above) would justify a higher sentence starting point for each CDSA charge.

114    I was thus of the view that the proposed starting sentences should be as follows:

##### Step 4: Adjust the starting point to take into account offender-specific factors

115    Unlike the case with the offender in _Huang_ who had pleaded guilty, the accused had contested his 30 proceeded charges, although he did eventually consent to having the remaining 13 charges taken into consideration for sentencing.

116    There was also nothing that was significant raised by him in mitigation, or presented in the course of the trial, that was really deserving of leniency, or that would warrant any significant discount in sentencing. In this regard, while he was in Singapore for a considerable period being investigated before he was charged, there was no evidence that there was any undue delay on the part of the authorities, especially when one considers the nature of not only the charges that he faced, but also the predicate offences involving various foreign serious offences committed in different jurisdictions.

##### Step 5: Make further adjustments to take into account the totality principle

117    The last step in the assessment of sentence is to consider the totality principle. Further, I also noted that out of the total sum cheated from the victims (USD327,787.34), a sum of USD 66,226.85 (about 20% of the total amount cheated) was recovered through the efforts of the CAD.

118    In addition, the Prosecution also informed the court of sentences that had been imposed in several cases involving s 44(1)(a) CDSA offences, where the courts have similarly applied the _Huang_ framework[^102]. The sentences imposed were as follows:

> (a)     66 months imprisonment imposed where the sum involved was S$957,000 ( in _Huang’s case_, where the offender had pleaded guilty);

> (b)     40 months’ and 6 months’ imprisonment imposed for sums of S$86,400 and S$5,950 respectively (in _Lim Yi Jie v Public Prosecutor_ MA No. 9133/2019/01 where the offender had pleaded guilty and the sentences were ordered to run concurrently);

> (c)     44 months’ imprisonment and 40 months’ imprisonment imposed for sums of S$1.5m and S$1,081,200 respectively (in _PP v Kiss Iosif & PP v Weidmann David_ MA 9252/2018/01-02 & MA 9254/2018/01-02 where the offender had pleaded guilty[^103]).

119    Further, in _PP v Ang Cheng Guan_ (where the offender was convicted on 4th October 2019 and sentenced on 18 October 2019), the CDSA charges involved sums ranging from $183,000 to $1,793,380, and the offender was sentenced to the following imprisonment terms for a global sentence of 104 months’ imprisonment:[^104]

> (a)     Section 44(1)(a) CDSA charge involving $1,793,380 – 68 months;

> (b)     Section 47(2)(b) CDSA charge involving $235,000 – 30 months;

> (c)     Section 47(2)(b) CDSA charge involving $195,000 – 25 months;

> (d)     Section 47(2)(b) CDSA charge involving $195,000 – 25 months;

> (e)     Section 47(2)(b) CDSA charge involving $189,000 – 25 months; and

> (f)     Section 47(2)(b) CDSA r/w s 109 PC charge involving $183,000 – 25 months.

120    In the present case, taking into consideration the precedent cases, and all the above factors including the fact that the CAD had recovered about 20% of the amount cheated, I adjusted the final sentence for each CDSA charge as follows:

#### (iii)   Global Sentence

121    In _PP v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 148</span> at \[41\], Sundaresh Menon CJ had made it clear that _“…as a general rule_, a multiple offender who has committed unelated offences should be separately punished for each offence, and this should be achieved by an order that the individual sentences run consecutively.”

122    In the present case, in light of the number, nature and circumstances of the charges that the accused faced, and bearing in mind the totality principle, I agreed with the Prosecution that the sentences for two of the most serious CDSA charges, as well as the sentence for one forgery charge should run consecutively, namely:

> (a)     DAC-903288-2018: 50 months’ imprisonment;

> (b)     DAC-903289-2018: 34 months’ imprisonment; and

> (c)     DAC-903290-2018: 4 months’ imprisonment

123    The global sentence is thus 88 months’ imprisonment. I also backdated the accused’s sentence to 26 January 2018, which was the date he was first remanded.

124    I am of the view that the final sentence is fair and proportionate to the offences that he has committed.

125    The accused being dissatisfied has filed an appeal against his conviction and sentence. As no stay of execution or bail pending appeal has been sought, the accused is presently serving his sentence.
