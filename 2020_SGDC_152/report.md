Criminal Law – Offences – Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9048/2020/01.\]

3 July 2020

### District Judge Kessler Soh:

## Introduction

1       Mr Mohamed Salim, aged 64 years, was a businessman. On 27 January 2017, while he was on his way to Malaysia for a holiday, he received a call from (according to him) a business acquaintance in Sri Lanka (“**Jamaldeen**”) seeking his assistance to safekeep a sum of money. The defendant asked his friend (“**Buhari**”) to collect the money on his behalf and to keep the money until his return. Buhari collected a bag from one “**Careem**”, and in the bag was a very large sum of money: Japanese Yen (JPY) 21 million (the “**¥21M**”) and Singapore Dollars (SGD) 109,000 (the “**S$109,000**”) (collectively, the “**Cash**”). After the defendant returned from Malaysia, he went to Buhari’s home on 31 January 2017. The defendant took the S$109,000 with him, leaving the ¥21M at Buhari’s home.

2       The defendant was subsequently charged with two offences under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 65A, 2000 Rev Ed, “**CDSA**”). The first charge was for acquiring the ¥21M and S$109,000 having _reasonable grounds to believe_ that the Cash represented another person’s benefits from criminal conduct, an offence under s 47(3) of the CDSA. The second charge was for concealing the sum of S$109,000, an offence under s 47(2)(a) of the CDSA.

3       The defendant denied both charges and claimed trial. At the conclusion of the trial, he was found guilty and convicted on both charges. On 19 February 2020, he was sentenced to 16 months’ imprisonment. He filed the present appeal against his conviction and sentence the same day, and is currently on bail pending the appeal.

4       The grounds of my decision are set out below.

## Trial

### Prosecution’s case

#### Theft of luggage bag containing Japanese currency at Changi Airport

7       Much of the background facts were not in dispute, and were set out in a Statement of Agreed Facts.[^1] The salient facts are summarised below (at \[8\]-\[14\]).

8       A courier employed by a gold bar trader, having sold gold bars to investors in Tokyo, packed a sum of JPY 114 million (approximately SGD 1.4 million) into a luggage bag. On 23 January 2017, the courier checked in the luggage bag and boarded a flight from Tokyo to Singapore. Upon arrival at Changi Airport in Singapore on 24 January 2017 at 12.45 am, the courier was unable to find the luggage bag when he went to collect it at the baggage carousel. He lodged a police report about the missing luggage at 7.26 pm that day.

9       CCTV footage revealed that the luggage bag had been stolen by one Ahmed Kabeer Mohamed Sabeer (“**Sabeer**”). After stealing the luggage bag, Sabeer handed it to one Jabbar Mohamed Thalal (“**Jabbar**”), and left on a flight to Colombo, Sri Lanka. The next day, on 25 January 2017, Sabeer contacted Abdul Careem Mohamed Ramzie (“**Careem**”, also known as “Ramzie”), who was then in Sri Lanka. Sabeer told Careem that Jabbar was in Singapore and that he needed help to carry some luggage back to Sri Lanka. (Careem was told that he would be paid ten thousand Sri Lankan rupees for his assistance.)

10     Careem arrived in Singapore on 27 January 2017 and checked into a hotel. He was instructed by Sabeer to meet Jabbar. Careem met Jabbar that morning, and Jabbar handed to Careem a suitcase. Careem brought the suitcase back to his hotel. When Careem reached his hotel room, Sabeer contacted him and instructed him to open the suitcase. Sabeer informed Careem that the suitcase contained JPY 98 million in 98 stacks, each containing 100 pieces of JPY 10,000 notes. Careem then went to various moneychangers in the Serangoon Road area to change the JPY into SGD.

11     Careem was instructed by Sabeer to hand JPY 21 million and SGD 109,000 to the defendant.

#### Defendant acquires ¥21M and S$109,000

12     Careem called the defendant later that day. The defendant informed that he was on his way to Malaysia, and asked Careem to pass the money to “Buhari” instead. The defendant then contacted and instructed Buhari to receive the money on his behalf. Careem and Buhari met the same day and Careem handed the Cash to Buhari. (Evidence was led from Buhari that he collected the money at the Angullia Mosque, as stated in the first charge.[^2]) The Cash of ¥21M and S$109,000 were contained in a plastic bag. Buhari brought the money back to his home at Veerasamy Road, and placed the money in a room that the defendant used as his office, and left it there for the defendant to collect.

13     On 31 January 2017, the defendant went to Buhari’s home. He removed the S$109,000 from the plastic bag and took it with him to his home at Block 157 Simei Road. He kept the S$109,000 together with his own money (S$34,385.00) in a black sling bag.

14     Sometime that day, the defendant made a phone call to a moneychanger and enquired about the currency exchange rate for JPY to SGD. The moneychanger, Wahid Ali bin Abdulla (“**Wahid**”) of Aramex International Pte Ltd, informed the defendant that there was a rumour going around that a theft involving cash in JPY had occurred at Changi Airport.[^3]

#### Reasonable grounds to believe the monies were stolen property

15     The ¥21M and S$109,000 were subsequently recovered by the police from the possession of the defendant. Evidence to this effect was given by the investigation officer from the Airport Police Division, Station Inspector Sujathar d/o Panneerselvam (PW6, “**IO Sujathar**”).

16     It was not in dispute that the monies were proceeds of crime (_ie_, theft). It was the prosecution’s case that the defendant had acquired the Cash of ¥21M and S$109,000 (first charge) and concealed the sum of S$109,000 (second charge); and that he had reasonable grounds to believe that they were stolen property. There were a number of “red flags” that would have put the defendant on notice that the monies could be stolen property. These included the fact that a very large sum of cash was handed over, the defendant had no basis to trust the person who asked him to safekeep the money, the phone calls leading to the handing of the money were suspicious, and the defendant was warned that the money could have been stolen. Yet he chose to ignore all these red flags. The prosecution’s submissions on these points will be considered in greater detail later in these grounds of decision.

### Defence

17     There being prima facie evidence to support the elements of each charge against the defendant, he was called upon to enter his defence. He elected to testify. The crux of the defence was that the defendant had agreed to collect and safekeep the money for a friend, Jamaldeen. He trusted Jamaldeen, and had no reason to doubt that the money he was asked to safekeep was legitimate. As for the S$109,000, he removed the money from Buhari’s home in order to keep it safe. The removal of the S$109,000 was not an act of concealment.

18     The defendant testified[^4] that he was one of the directors of Jamaliyah Enterprises Private Limited, and he was in the business of import and export of electronic goods. He had known Jamaldeen, who was in the same trade, for 20 years.

19     On 27 January 2017, at about 6.48 pm, the defendant received a call from Jamaldeen. Jamaldeen was calling him from Sri Lanka, and asking whether the defendant could help him to safekeep some money that he had sent from Sri Lanka.[^5] The defendant refused at first, as he was at that time travelling to Malaysia with his wife. Jamaldeen insisted, however, as he did not trust his employees with the large sum of money over the Chinese New Year period. Hence Jamaldeen requested the defendant to safekeep the monies for him until his men came to collect it. As Jamaldeen was in a dilemma, the defendant said he would get Buhari to collect the money; and Jamaldeen told the defendant that his men would call the defendant to make the arrangements.[^6]

20     The defendant then received a call from Careem (known to him as “Ramzie”) at 7.42 pm.[^7] The defendant told Careem that he was unable to come and that Buhari would come instead. Careem did not agree at first, but said he would check and call later. In the meantime, the defendant called Buhari and asked him for a “one time” favour to pick up the cash. When Careem called again, Careem told the defendant that “his boss” had agreed to give the money to Buhari. The defendant then gave Buhari’s number to Careem and asked him to make the arrangement to pass the money.[^8] At 8.08 pm[^9], Careem called the defendant and told the defendant that he had handed the money to Buhari. Careem told the defendant that he handed over ¥21M and S$109,000.[^10] The defendant later called Buhari and told him to keep the money at his home, and the defendant would collect the money when he returned from Malaysia.

21     On 31 January 2017, after returning from Malaysia, the defendant went to Buhari’s flat to check on the monies. He noticed that the ¥21M was packed nicely, while the Singapore currency was “open” and not packed like the Japanese currency, and he was concerned that anyone could have taken it, and that the other tenants in Buhari’s flat might steal the money. So he took the S$109,000 and put the money in his sling bag (which he carried with him to the office and home every day). He left the stacks of Japanese currency there as they were bulky, and the tenants (who were computer professionals from India) would not take the money as they would have to go to the moneychanger to change the money, and their images would be caught on CCTV cameras. [^11]

22     That day (31 January 2017), at 12.21 pm, the defendant called Aramex International to enquire about the exchange rate of Japanese currency. He did so as Jamaldeen would ask him about the rates. He spoke to Wahid of Aramex International, who told him that there was a rumour that more than JPY 100 million had been stolen. At 1.44 pm the defendant called Jamaldeen to ask Jamaldeen whether he had sent stolen monies to him.[^12] Jamaldeen angrily retorted that this was money that he had sent from Sri Lanka. The defendant then called Wahid and informed him so.[^13]

23     On 2 February 2017 (which was a Thursday), the defendant received a call from Wahid, who asked whether Jamaldeen’s men had come to collect the money.[^14] Subsequently, the defendant tried many times to call Jamaldeen to ascertain when his men were coming to pick up the money. After making eight unsuccessful calls to Jamaldeen, the defendant received a call from Wahid who asked about the outcome of his calls. The defendant did not suspect that that he was in possession of stolen money and hence he was frank and forthright with Wahid about all his dealings with Jamaldeen.[^15] The defendant was finally able to contact Jamaldeen.[^16] Jamaldeen told the defendant that he was in India and that his men would come to collect the money either the next day or Saturday. Jamaldeen reiterated that the money was his money and that he had sent it from Sri Lanka. [^17]

24     On 3February 2017, the defendant called Jamaldeen many times to find out when his men were coming to collect the money. After many unsuccessful attempts, Jamaldeen called the defendant and said that he was in a hospital in Chennai for treatment.[^18]

25     On 4 February 2017, the defendant was expecting Jamaldeen’s men to call him. They did not. Instead the police came to his flat and asked him about the Japanese Yen. He immediately told the police that he had ¥21M and explained to IO Sujathar the circumstances in which he got the money from Jamaldeen. He offered to call Jamaldeen immediately and have him speak directly to her, or at least put it on speaker so she could hear what was happening, but she refused and maintained that he was part of the syndicate that stole the money. The defendant also told IO Sujathar that the money was in Buhari’s flat, and she brought the defendant to Buhari’s flat to retrieve the ¥21M.[^19]

26     The defendant testified that although he was initially investigated about the ¥21M, he cooperated fully with IO Sujathar and voluntarily informed her that the S$109,000 was kept in the bag at his home. Arrangements were made to pick up the money from his home. He showed the police officers where he kept the bag, which was resting against a dressing table in his bedroom. The bag containing the money was in the open and he did not attempt to conceal the money in any way.[^20] He had kept the S$109,000 together with his own money (S$34,385) and documents and cheque books in the bag, which he carried wherever he went.

27     The defendant also testified that he did not know any of the persons named by the prosecution in connection with this case. He did not know Sabeer, Jabbar or Careem.[^21]

28     In his caution statements, the defendant was emphatic that he did not know or suspect that the money was stolen, and he maintained that he was merely keeping the money for Jamaldeen. In his caution statement relating to the second charge, he stated:

> I did not know that it was a stolen money or proceeds of crime. I believe that it was Jamaldeen’s money when he told me so. I have been talking to him since 31st January 2017 to 4th February 2017. He has been reiterating it’s his money. I was keeping it in good faith for him as he wanted to take it back.[^22]

### Issues to be determined

29     There were two main issues to be determined at the trial.

30     The first issue was whether the defendant had “reasonable grounds to believe”, when he acquired (with the assistance of Buhari) the ¥21M and S$109,000, that the monies represented another person’s benefits from criminal conduct.

31     The second issue, which pertained to the second charge, was whether the defendant _concealed_ the S$109,000.

### Decision

#### Whether the defendant had “reasonable grounds to believe”

##### (1)   Defence’s submissions

32     It was submitted by the defence that the defendant did not have reasonable grounds to believe that the monies were proceeds of criminal conduct. From the outset of the investigations, the defendant maintained that he did not know or have reason to believe that the monies were stolen monies or proceeds of a crime. He believed Jamaldeen when Jamaldeen asked him to safekeep the money, and he did so from 27 January to 4 February 2017. He did a favour for Jamaldeen who was his good friend. During this period, he had been talking to Jamaldeen, and Jamaldeen assured him that one of Jamaldeen’s men would come and collect it. Before Jamaldeen’s men could come and collect the monies, the defendant was arrested. If he had known or suspected it was stolen money, he would have immediately surrendered it to the police.

33     The following were highlighted by the defence:

> (a)     The defendant did not give specific instructions to Buhari to hide the money. When the defendant was in Malaysia, not once did he call Buhari to enquire about the money. Although he knew that it was a large sum of money, he did not show any sense of urgency.

> (b)     The defendant did not conceal the monies either in Buhari’s flat or in his own flat. The monies were easily accessible. There was no covert actions by the defendant to hide the monies. The monies were kept in the bag under the study table in a room at Buhari’s flat. The room was not locked. On 31 January 2017, when the defendant went to Buhari’s flat, he left the ¥21M at the flat. The S$109,000 was kept in a bag that he brought with him everywhere he went.

> (c)     When Wahid mentioned that the monies might have been stolen from the airport, the defendant called Jamaldeen no less than 14 times to confirm that the monies he was holding were not proceeds of crime. Jamaldeen was not a fictitious figure, as the call records indicated that there was such a person. He had known Jamaldeen for 20 years and he did not expect Jamaldeen to betray him. He knew Jamaldeen as a bona fide businessman and his friend. On the day of his arrest he told IO Sujathar that the monies belonged to Jamaldeen and offered to call him (but she refused to allow him to do so).

> (d)     The defendant had no dealings with any of the perpetrators of the theft of the monies from the airport.

> (e)     The defendant did not deal with the monies, and he did not benefit in cash or kind in safekeeping the monies.

##### (2)   Prosecution’s submissions

34     The prosecution submitted, on the other hand, that the defendant had reasonable grounds to believe that the monies were proceeds of crime. The defendant was an experienced businessperson with 27 years of experience in the import and export business. He was a director of Jamaliyah Enterprise Pte Ltd, a company which dealt in the import and export of electronic products. He understood the need for proper documentation in order to show that the goods which his company imported and exported had been properly obtained.[^23] He was aware that the bringing in of large sums of money into Singapore required proper documentation and declarations.[^24] The prosecution submitted that given his background as an experienced businessperson, an individual standing in his shoes would have been much slower to agree to a request to safekeep a large sum of cash without any documentary proof verification.

35     The prosecution submitted that there were a number of “red flags”:

> (a)     A very large sum of money in cash was handed over to the defendant: ¥21M (about S$300,000) and S$109,000. The defendant himself conceded that the money that was handed over to him was a huge amount.[^25] The large sum of cash was an obvious red flag which should have caused the defendant reasonable grounds to believe that the money was the proceeds of crime.

> (b)     The defendant was not close to Jamaldeen and had no basis to trust him. On his own evidence, the defendant had not met Jamaldeen for a long time. He last met Jamaldeen on one occasion when Jamaldeen visited Singapore eight years ago (six years before the incident). He stopped having any business dealings with Jamaldeen since 2012. He only had very short telephone conversations with Jamaldeen once a week. He had no personal relationship with Jamaldeen. He had never held on to money for Jamaldeen before, let alone a large sum of money.[^26] The defendant also said that he knew Jamaldeen as a man who took steps to evade the attention of the Sri Lankan authorities when bringing money out of the country and into Singapore. Jamaldeen would ask the defendant for currency exchange rates, as Jamaldeen trusted him to keep such matters confidential, so as to avoid tipping off the authorities.[^27]

> (c)     The phone calls on 27 January 2017 leading to the defendant’s agreement to collect and safekeep the money were suspicious. In the first phone call with Jamaldeen at 6.48 pm, the defendant was asked by Jamaldeen to safekeep a large sum of money without any explanation as to the source of the money or any assurances that the money was legitimate. The defendant was not told by Jamaldeen what the money was going to be used for nor was he told whether there were going to be papers or documents handed over together with the money. The suspiciousness of the request was amplified by the fact that the defendant had never once dealt with money for Jamaldeen before, let alone a large sum of money.[^28]

> (d)     Careem called at 7.42 pm, and informed the defendant that he was going to be handed ¥21M. The money was to be kept for Jamaldeen. When the defendant informed Careem that Buhari would be collecting the money on his behalf, Careem told the defendant that he (Careem) needed to ask “Sabeer” for permission before handing the money over to Buhari. Careem subsequently called at 7.53 pm and told the defendant that Sabeer had agreed to give the money to Buhari.[^29] The prosecution submitted that the mention of the name “Sabeer” was extremely suspicious given that the defendant had only agreed to collect money for Jamaldeen, and not Sabeer or anyone else. Sabeer was a complete stranger to the defendant and to the transaction. It was telling was that the defendant did not ask Careem to clarify who Sabeer was nor did he seek to clarify in the subsequent phone calls with Jamaldeen who Sabeer was.[^30]

36     The prosecution highlighted that the defendant was warned that the money he was safekeeping for Jamaldeen could be stolen monies. On 31 January 2017, at 12.21 pm, while the defendant was at Buhari’s home, he spoke with the moneychanger Wahid (above, at \[14\]) over the phone and enquired about the exchange rate for JPY 10 million. Wahid informed the defendant of a rumour that was going around concerning a large sum of Japanese currency that had been stolen from the airport. The defendant then called Jamaldeen, who asserted that it was his money; the defendant accepted Jamaldeen’s explanation at face value despite the lack of any form of documentary proof or assurance. The defendant called Wahid again after that and told Wahid that his friend from Colombo had sent the money. Wahid’s evidence was that he told the defendant that it was very difficult to get an amount of JPY 10 million sent from Sri Lanka, and advised the defendant to surrender the sum to the police.[^31] The prosecution submitted that the warnings from Wahid, a moneychanger whom the defendant trusted, and Wahid’s advice to surrender the money to the police, gave the defendant reasonable grounds to believe that the monies were the proceeds of crime.

37     The prosecution submitted that the defendant’s background as an experienced businessperson, combined with the various red flags in the case, clearly show that a reasonable person in his position, with knowledge of the red flags, would have embarked on a chain of reasoning or line of enquiry that would have led to the conclusion that the monies were proceeds of crime.

##### (3)   Decision

38     The meaning of “reasonable grounds to believe”, in the context of the CDSA, was explained by the High Court in _Ang Jeanette v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 1</span> (“_Ang Jeanette_”, at \[70\]):

> …it would perhaps be useful, at this juncture, to reiterate briefly the local case law on the meaning of “reasonable grounds to believe”. In _Ow Yew Beng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 1 SLR(R) 536</span>, the High Court held (at \[10\]) that having “reason to believe” involved a “lesser degree of conviction than certainty but a higher one than speculation”. In applying the test, the court must assume the position of the actual individual involved (ie, including his knowledge and experience), but must reason (ie, infer from the facts known to such individual) from that position like an objective reasonable man (see _Koh Hak Boon v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] 2 SLR(R) 733</span> at \[13\] and _PP v Wang Ziyi Able_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 2 SLR(R) 61</span> at \[87\]).

39     I agreed with the submission of the prosecution that there were reasonable grounds for the defendant to believe that the sums of ¥21M and S$109,000 that he acquired represented another person’s benefits from criminal conduct.

40     The evidence showed that the defendant was an experienced businessman. He was aware that the bringing in of large sums of money into Singapore required proper documentation. A person in the defendant’s position as an experienced businessman would have been slow to agree to a request to safekeep a large sum of cash without any proper documentation as to the source of the funds. Yet the defendant agreed to safekeep the large amounts of cash for Jamaldeen, although he had never safekept money for Jamaldeen before and did not have a close business or personal relationship with Jamaldeen. In fact, according to the defendant, he had not seen Jamaldeen for about six years before that, nor had business dealings with him during that time. Given these circumstances, there was plainly no reason for the defendant to have trusted Jamaldeen and agreed to safekeep the monies for Jamaldeen.

41     As was pointed out by the prosecution, there were “red flags” that, taken together, constituted sufficiently suspicious circumstances that would have led a reasonable person in the defendant’s position to question whether the Cash was legitimate or not. Had the defendant done so, as a reasonable person would have done, he would have arrived at the reasonable conclusion that the monies were probably proceeds of crime.

42     Accordingly, I found that the defendant, when he acquired the Cash of ¥21M and S$109,000 on 27 January 2017, did have reasonable grounds to believe (as a reasonable person in the defendant’s position would have) that these monies represented another person’s benefits of criminal conduct.

#### Whether the defendant concealed the S$109,000

43     The defence submitted that the defendant had not concealed the S$109,000, because the bag containing the money was in plain sight and not concealed in any obscure part of his home. He placed the sum together with his own money, and he carried the bag wherever he went. As he had nothing to hide, he voluntarily provided this information to the police and the monies were retrieved accordingly.

44     The prosecution submitted that the defendant, in removing the S$109,000 from Buhari’s home, had concealed the amount. This was because no one else, apart from the defendant, would have known or have access to the sum. By removing the S$109,000 from Buhari’s home and placing it inside a bag at his home, the defendant had effectively hidden the amount away, and it did not matter that the bag was found in plain sight and not in an obscure part of his home. The act of concealment had caused the police, when investigating the matter, not to realise the existence of the S$109,000 (until later). The prosecution also highlighted that it was not true that the defendant had voluntarily informed IO Sujathar of the existence and location of the S$109,000. The testimony of IO Sujathar was that the defendant only disclosed the existence and location of the S$109,000 after being confronted with Buhari’s account.[^32] It was only after Buhari told the investigating officers that he had collected ¥21M _and_ S$109,000 from Careem that the defendant, after being confronted with this, came clean about the S$109,000 and where it was kept.

45     I accepted the submission of the prosecution. In my judgment, the defendant’s act of removing the S$109,000 from Buhari’s home and taking it with him was an act of concealment of the money. No one else, apart from the defendant, would have known where the money was or would have had access to the money.

#### Verdict

46     Accordingly, I found that the prosecution had proven both charges against the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant was found guilty and convicted on both charges.

## Sentencing

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

49     In the prosecution’s Skeletal Submissions on Sentence[^33], it was submitted that general deterrence was the primary sentencing consideration for money-laundering offences because of the debilitating effects that such offences had on society. Various sentencing factors were highlighted. A large amount of money was involved. There was some degree of planning and premeditation. The defendant’s action of taking steps to conceal the S$109,000 was an aggravating factor.

50     For the first charge, the prosecution sought a sentence of at least 20 to 22 months’ imprisonment. This was extrapolated from the sentence imposed on Careem in relation to his offence of handing over the ¥21M and S$109,000 to the defendant through Buhari. Careem was sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment for that offence (see below, at \[60\]). The prosecution submitted that a slight uplift to 20 months’ imprisonment was justified on the basis that Careem had pleaded guilty while the defendant claimed trial. That the uplift was slight also accounted for the differing role played by the defendant, who acted as a safekeeper of the monies, compared to Careem, who had actively sought to exchange the currency and dissipate the money.

51     For the second charge, the prosecution submitted that a lower sentence of 12 to 14 months’ imprisonment was justified on the basis that it involved a smaller quantum of money.

### Mitigation Plea

52     In the defendant’s Plea in Mitigation[^34], it was mentioned that the defendant was married, with two sons aged 38 and 36 years. He was the sole breadwinner of the family, helping to contribute money on a monthly basis to help support his wife, who was a housewife. His wife suffered a stroke on 25 March 2017, and has suffered from poor health since then.

53     It was highlighted by the defence that the defendant did not gain financially from the offences. He played a minimal role. He merely told Buhari to collect from Careem the suitcase containing the monies. After doing so, Buhari brought the monies to his flat; and the defendant subsequently brought the sum of S$109,000 to his home.

54     For the first charge, the defence suggested that a lower sentence of 14 months’ imprisonment be imposed on the defendant. This was on account of the wide disparity in the roles played by the defendant compared with Careem. For the second charge, the defence suggested that a sentence of about 8 months’ imprisonment be imposed, to run concurrently.

### Decision on Sentence

#### Sentencing objective

55     The primary sentencing objective in money laundering offences is _deterrence_. In _Ang Jeanette_ (cited above at \[38\]), the High Court stated (at \[75\]):

> Money laundering is an indivisible part of international criminal activity and is detrimental to society. The unimpeded circulation of proceeds from crime will have a prejudicial effect on the fabric of society and the economy. The criminalisation of money laundering has as its objective the undermining of crime by removing from circulation the proceeds of predicate crimes.

56     In the present case, the amounts involved were large, and a substantial term of imprisonment was warranted as a deterrent.

#### Sentences of other persons involved

57     In deciding upon the appropriate sentence for the defendant, I considered the sentences imposed on other persons who were involved in the laundering of the Japanese currency stolen from the airport in the present case. These other persons had _pleaded guilty_ to money laundering-related offences.

58     Marikkar Bazeer Mohamed Ismail (“**Marikkar**”) pleaded guilty to one charge under s 47(2)(_b_) of the CDSA. Marikkar had been contacted by one Faizal in Colombo. He was asked to go to Singapore to collect money from Careem, and was promised $200 if he did so. He took JPY 10 million and S$182,000 from Careem. In common intention with Careem, he _attempted_ to remit money to Sri Lanka through a remittance business. Marikkar was sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment for his offence.

59     Ameer Hamza Arafath (“**Ameer**”) pleaded guilty to one charge under s 47(2)(a) of the CDSA, with one other charge taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. Ameer was acting on the instructions of Sabeer, the mastermind. Careem handed $123,000 to Ameer. Ameer subsequently handed the money to an unknown person. For his part, Ameer received $500. In the charge taken into consideration, Ameer had abetted Careem into changing JPY 5 million to S$61,000. Ameer was sentenced to 20 months’ imprisonment for his offence.

60     Careem pleaded guilty to one charge under s 47(3) of the CDSA and two charges under s 47(2)(_b_) of the CDSA. Three other charges under the CDSA were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. Careem was acting on the instructions of Sabeer, the mastermind. Careem was told that he would be paid 10,000 Sri Lankan rupees to come to Singapore and carry a luggage back to Sri Lanka. For the first proceeded charge, Careem took over a suitcase containing JPY 98,000,000 (approximately S$1.2 million); he was sentenced to 24 months’ imprisonment for this offence. For the second proceeded charge, Careem handed over the suitcase containing ¥21M and S$109,000 to Buhari; Careem was sentenced to _18 months’ imprisonment_ for this offence. (Careem received a total sentence of 42 months’ imprisonment.)

#### Appropriate sentence in the present case

61     In my judgement, the defendant’s culpability was lower than Careem’s. The defendant’s role, based on the evidence adduced at the trial, was to safekeep the monies. There was no evidence that he stood to gain financially from his involvement. While the defendant claimed trial to his charges and was found guilty only after a trial, I did not consider that to be a factor that should weigh so heavily against the defendant such that he receive a sentence higher than Careem (who pleaded guilty).

62     All in, it was my judgment that the defendant’s sentence ought to be slightly lower than the 18 months’ imprisonment received by Careem. For the first charge of acquiring the Cash of ¥21M and S$109,000, having reasonable grounds to believe that the sums represented benefits from criminal conduct, a sentence of 16 months’ imprisonment would, in my judgement, appropriately reflect the culpability of the defendant compared with Careem. For the second charge of concealing the S$109,000, given that it involved a lower amount, a lower sentence of about 10 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate.

63     I also considered it appropriate that both sentences ought to run concurrently, as the two offences could be considered as part of the same transaction. (That both sentences ought to run concurrently was not disputed by the prosecution and defence.)

### Sentence imposed

64     Accordingly, the following sentences were imposed:
