\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9161/2021/01.\]

19 October 2021

### District Judge Terence Tay:

1       Chew Kong Heng, also referred to as “Simon”, in the present case had claimed trial to two counts of cheating under section 468 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008) (“**PC**”) by forging application forms to obtain credit facilities by two different banks.

2       The alleged offences took place about a decade ago in 2010. Given the passage of time, the case was inevitably presented with evidential challenges such as missing documents, expunged records and diminished memories.

3       At the end of a trial that took place over 21 days, I convicted the accused of both charges. Thereafter, the accused pleaded guilty to three other charges under section 177 PC for furnishing false information to a public servant and consented to another three charges under section 177 PC being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

4       On 12 July 2021, I sentenced the accused to 14 and 8 months’ imprisonment for the charges under section 468 PC and 1 month for each of the three charges under section 177 PC. I ordered the sentence of 14 months’ imprisonment and the sentence of 1 month’s imprisonment for one of the charges under section 177 PC to run consecutively, resulting in a global sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment.

5       The accused had appealed against the conviction for the charges under section 468 PC but not the individual and global sentences for the charges.

## THE CHARGES AT THE TRIAL

6       The accused, a Malaysia citizen and a Singapore permanent resident, was charged with two counts of forging two application forms, on or around 19 March 2010, by fraudulently executing and signing the:

> (a)     the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited (“**OCBC**”) EasiCredit and Titanium MasterCard credit card application form (the “**OCBC Form**”);[^1] and

> (b)     the CIMB Bank Berhad (“**CIMB**”) Platinum MasterCard credit card application form (the “**CIMB Form**”),[^2]

in the name of one Mr Lee Tuck On (“**Lee**”) with the intention to cheat OCBC and CIMB, respectively, into granting to him credit facilities (the “**OCBC Facility**” and the “**CIMB Facility**”, as the case may be, and, collectively, the “**Facilities**”), which are offences punishable under section 468 PC.

7       For avoidance of doubt, the OCBC Facility refers to the OCBC Titanium MasterCard credit card facility only as OCBC did not grant the EasiCredit facility.

8       The charge involving OCBC will be referred to as “**C2A**” and the charge involving CIMB will be referred to as “**C1**”.

## ELEMENTS OF THE OFFENCE

9       The elements of the offences are as follows:

> (a)     The accused had executed and signed the OCBC Form and the CIMB Form (collectively, the “**Forms**”) in Lee’s name;

> (b)     The accused did not have Lee’s authorisation to execute and sign the Forms; and

> (c)     The accused intended to use the Forms, being forged documents, to cheat OCBC and CIMB into believing that the OCBC Form and the CIMB Form, respectively, were Lee’s applications for the OCBC Facility and the CIMB Facility, respectively.

10     It was not disputed at trial that the accused had filled up the Forms and submitted them to OCBC and CIMB as Lee’s applications for the Facilities. Consequently, OCBC and CIMB had processed and granted the OCBC Facility and the CIMB Facility, respectively, to Lee. However, all documents pertaining to the OCBC Facility and the CIMB Facility were sent to the accused.

11     The gravamen of the accused’s defence at trial was that he did not falsify Lee’s signature on the Forms. Instead, the accused claimed that he had filled up the Forms at Evelyn’s behest and had given them to Evelyn for her to procure Lee’s signature before submitting them to OCBC and CIMB.

## THE PROSECUTION’S CASE

12     The nub of the prosecution’s case was that the accused had completed, signed and submitted the Forms without Lee’s knowledge and authority.

13     The principal witnesses for the prosecution were Lee and Evelyn, whose evidence were supplemented, where relevant, by the investigation officers, Inspector Siaw Kah Swee (“**Insp Siaw**”) and Inspector Jessica Seow Wan Nee (“**Insp Seow**”), and representatives from OCBC and CIMB.

##### Lee’s evidence

14     Lee worked as a watch technician for over 40 years and retired in 2017. At the material time, he was working for Ball Watch Singapore Pte Ltd.[^3] Lee presented himself as a frail and simply but neatly dressed elderly gentleman who looked older than his 68 years of age at the start of the trial. He came across as an earnest and truthful witness who testified in a thoughtful manner. He was candid when his memory failed him in respect of certain details of events, his personal finances and his interactions with the accused in 2010.[^4]

15     Lee had sight of the Forms for the first time at trial.[^5] He testified that he had never seen or signed on the Forms before and, consequently, could not have been aware that the Forms had been submitted to OCBC and CIMB, as the case may be, for the Facilities.

16     Lee could not recognise the handwriting and the signature on the Forms. He also confirmed that the Forms contained false particulars except for some of his personal particulars such as his National Registration Identity Card (“**NRIC**”) number and his home address at 865 Woodlands Street 83, #XXX, Singapore 730865 (“**Lee’s Address**”).[^6] Some of the saliant particulars on the Forms that were false included the following:

> (a)     the mobile number, XXX (the “**Unknown Mobile Number**”) did not belong to Lee;

> (b)     Lee’s employer was not Perazim Marketing and Consulting Pte Ltd, (“**Perazim**”);

> (c)     the correspondence or billing address, 336 Smith Street, #05-301 New Bridge Centre, Singapore 050336, was the address of Perazim (the “**Accused’s Address**”) and not Lee’s Address; and

> (d)     in relation to the CIMB Form only, Lee does not know “Veronica” who was listed as the emergency contact person with the telephone number XXX.[^7]

17     Lee was clueless as to how copies of his NRIC and Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (“**IRAS**”) Notices of Assessment (“**NOA**”) came to be attached to the Forms but testified that he had provided his NRIC and various documents akin to the NOA to the accused through Evelyn as the accused was assisting Lee with tax filings.[^8]

18     For avoidance of doubt, besides the Forms, two other forms had been submitted to OCBC in Lee’s name for other credit facilities, namely:[^9]

> (a)     application form for a personal credit line dated 7 April 2010 (the “**OCBC PCL Form**”);[^10] and

> (b)     application form for OCBC Robinsons Visa Platinum credit card dated 12 May 2010 (the “**OCBC Robinsons Form**”).[^11]

19     Pursuant to these other applications, OCBC had also approved a personal credit line facility (the “**OCBC PCL Facility**”) and the Robinsons Visa Platinum credit card (the “**OCBC Robinsons Facility**”).

20     The OCBC PCL Form, the OCBC Robinsons Form, the OCBC PCL Facility and the OCBC Robinsons Facility were not the subject of C2A and C1 and it suffices to mention that Lee had also denied making or authorising these applications.

21     Lee first realised something was amiss (_ie._ that Facilities had been made and granted without his knowledge) when he called OCBC on 22 June 2010 to enquire about his accounts with OCBC (the “**OCBC 1st Telephone Call**”). As Lee denied applying for the OCBC Facility, OCBC blocked the OCBC Facility.[^12]

22     Ms Aanisah Raadhiyah Yeo, OCBC Manager (Card Fraud), (“**Ms Yeo**”) followed up with a telephone call to Lee on 30 June 2010 to obtain more information on his enquiry on 22 June 2010 (the “**OCBC 2nd Telephone Call**”). According to Ms Yeo, OCBC’s records disclosed that Lee had denied applying for the OCBC Facility, amongst other facilities, but had purportedly mentioned that he had provided a document to the accused for a personal loan.[^13]

23     At the end of the OCBC 2nd Telephone Call, there was no resolution as far as the OCBC Facility was concerned as Ms Yeo had informed Lee that the OCBC Facility “will only be closed once it’s fully settled”.[^14]

24     Subsequently, OCBC updated the correspondence address for the OCBC Facility to Lee’s Address so that subsequent correspondences would be sent to Lee’s Address.[^15]

25     In relation to the personal loan that was brought up during the OCBC 2nd Telephone Call, no one was able to provide any details or shed any light on what it was all about. Even OCBC’s records appeared to be sketchy and devoid of details:[^16]

>   
| 

Q

 | 

What---what was the personal loan in reference to?

 |
| 

A

 | 

It’s a---it’s like a credit line loan.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Was this explicitly stated during the phone call?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I’m---I can’t confirm for that.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Then why do you say it’s a credit line loan?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Be---because in our system record show that he has 2 credit card and a personal loan credit line that was given to him.

 |

  
  

26     On 6 April 2011, Lee filed a police report bearing number A/20110406/2186 alleging that the accused had opened two accounts under Lee’s name with OCBC and withdrawn a total of $8,300 from the accounts (“**Lee’s First Report**”).[^17]

27     On or about 12 April 2011, OCBC’s solicitors sent Lee a letter of demand dated 12 April 2011 (the “**OCBC LOD**”).[^18] The next day, _ie._ 13 April 2011, Lee and Evelyn went down to OCBC’s main branch at OCBC Centre and met with a staff to dispute the OCBC LOD (the “**OCBC 1st Meeting**”). The following is Ms Yeo’s account of OCBC’s record of that meeting:[^19]

>   
| 

Q

 | 

So, during the meeting with OCBC on the 13th of April 2011, what did Mr. Lee Tuck Onn, uh, say to OCBC?

 |
| 

A

 | 

From what---from the record it shows that---we are not sure whether it’s Mr. or Mrs. Lee, informed the bank that this facility is not applied by them and they also state that there is---they suspect that this Mr. ‘Simon’ because they have given the---their NIRC and some personal documents to him and he has not returned it to them for several months. So, he actually told us that the facility is not applied by them and hence he will not be able to---he will not be making the payment.

 |

  
  

28     At the meeting, Lee executed a document[^20] authorising Evelyn to handle his dispute with OCBC on his behalf (the “**LOA**”).[^21]

29     After the OCBC 1st Meeting, OCBC conducted an internal investigation and concluded that Lee was liable for the monies owing pursuant to the OCBC LOD. OCBC notified Lee of its decision by way of a letter dated 6 May 2011.[^22]

30     On 27 May 2011, Lee and Evelyn met OCBC again to discuss a repayment plan (the “**OCBC 2nd Meeting**”).[^23] Following the meeting, Lee had made a payment of $700 to OCBC. Consequently, OCBC held another meeting with Lee (the “**OCBC 3rd Meeting**”) on 14 June 2011 and offered a debt relief plan. OCBC’s records did not indicate if Evelyn was present at the OCBC 3rd Meeting. The details of the debt relief plan was documented in a Debt Relief Program Application Form dated 14 June 2011 and signed by Lee[^24] (“**DRP Form**”), and letter by OCBC to Lee dated 22 June 2011[^25] (“**DRP Letter**”).

31     On 14 August 2011, Lee filed another police report bearing number A/20110814/2060 which made reference to Lee’s First Report and contained other information that were not relevant to the present case (“**Lee’s Second Report**”).[^26]

32     Lee testified that he never received the monthly statements by OCBC dated 26 April 2010 and 26 May 2010[^27] which were sent to the Accused’s Address (the “**OCBC Statements**”).

33     Similarly, Lee never received the monthly statements by CIMB which were sent to the Accused’s Address between April 2010 and December 2014 (the “**CIMB Statements**”).[^28] However, Lee had received a statutory demand dated 27 October 2014 that was sent by CIMB’s solicitors to Lee’s Address.[^29]

34     Lee had no knowledge of the transactions stated in the OCBC Statements and the CIMB Statements (collectively, the “**Statements**”).[^30]

35     As far as Lee’s relationship with the accused was concerned, Lee had had little contact with the accused but recalled meeting the accused at a MacDonald’s fast-food restaurant with Evelyn and one of their sons.[^31] Lee was aware that the accused was rendering assistance to Evelyn’s business but did not appear to know much about the details.[^32]

##### Evelyn’s evidence

36     In contrast to Lee, 65-year-old Evelyn,[^33] also known as “Carol”, was a feisty lady with an imposing personality. She was an outspoken person who exuded confidence when testifying but, on a number of occasions, lashed out at the accused with harsh words of rebuke in an excessively animated fashion. Evelyn frequently went off on a tangent when giving her oral testimony and did not confine herself to answering questions asked of her, preferring to give her evidence in her own way.

37     At the material time, Evelyn was running her a boutique spa business known as You Xuan Beauty & Health Centre (the “**Health Centre**”) with about five to six employees.[^34] Business was not good and Evelyn faced a bit of financial difficulty and owed slightly over a thousand dollars in overhead wages.[^35]

38     Around end-2009 or early-2010, the accused had approached Evelyn to offer consultancy services for the Health Centre at a price of $3,000. Evelyn turned down the accused’s offer as she did not have the means to pay him.[^36]

39     Even though Evelyn did not engage the accused’s consultancy services, the accused kept the conversation going with Evelyn and, at one point, offered to help Evelyn and Lee file their income tax returns,[^37] which Evelyn accepted. To facilitate the filing of Lee’s income tax returns, Evelyn provided a photocopy of Lee’s NRIC, Lee’s income documents and information on Lee’s employment to the accused.[^38] However, the accused claimed that the photocopy of Lee’s NRIC was not clear enough and requested for Lee’s NRIC which Evelyn provided.[^39] The accused also requested for the names of Lee’s and Evelyn’s parents purportedly for the purpose of filing the income tax returns. However, as Evelyn did not know the names of Lee’s parents, she only provided the name of her mother, “Wong Siew Lan”, to the accused.[^40]

40     About one to two months’ later, despite multiple requests by Evelyn, the accused had still not returned Lee’s NRIC to Evelyn. Evelyn got worried when one of her friends mentioned to her that a person could get into trouble by passing his or her NRIC around,[^41] and decided to file a police report.

41     On 10 June 2010, Evelyn filed a police report bearing number A/20100610/2184 stating the following (“**Evelyn’s First Report**”):[^42]

>     On the 01 Jan 2010, I hired a Business Consultant, namely Simon, to help me manage my Shop (You Xian Beauty & Health Centre). At the end of February, he suggested that we could loan money from the bank, OCBC, to rent another bigger shop. As such, he said that he need my NRIC and my husband NRIC, namely, Lee Tuck Onn, \[REDACTED\]. He claims that he would settle paper work by himself and would inform us when everything is settle. He returned my NRIC after one week later but he kept my husband NRIC and gave a reason that it is easier for him to produce the NRIC when the bank needs it. I tried asking back the NRIC from him but to no avail. On 10 June 2010, he still have not returned my husband NRIC.

>     I am lodging this report for reclaim liability.

42     Shortly thereafter, on 18 June 2010, Evelyn filed another police report bearing number A/20100618/2094 stating the following (“**Evelyn’s Second Report**”):[^43]

>     On 18 June 2010, I am lodging a report to add on to a report that I have made vide incident A/20100610/2184. Simon had also taken my cheque book, company records, office rental agreement and POSB and UOB Bank Book. He also took my UOB Atm card. He has also taken papers that I have pen my signature on. Officer Sunny called Simon to enquire the reason for taking the items. Simon informed Officer Sunny that he took all these items for business dealings purpose. He also informed that he would return all these items on Wednesday. I also wish to state that I have discovered that Simon has opened a OCBC account under my husband’s name and there was transaction in the account which I do not know what it is for. He also took $4,500/- out from m husband Citibank account. However he did not informed me and said that he would pay back but Citibank is still looking after my husband for not paying up the money. I wish to state that I am not very good in business and he had told me that he could help me in expanding my business.

43     Subsequent to filing of the police reports, Evelyn became aware of banks sending letters to Lee demanding payment although she could not pinpoint the exact date or provide details.[^44]

44     Evelyn testified that she had gone with Lee to file Lee’s 1st Report and Lee’s 2nd Report. She had also gone with Lee to meet with OCBC to dispute the payments because “the bank kept sending us letters” and “\[it\] was a headache for us”.[^45] However, Evelyn could not recall when the meeting with OCBC took place.[^46]

45     In court, Evelyn could not recognise the DRP Form and the DRP Letter although she recognised Lee’s handwriting and signature in the DRP Form. Evelyn did not know why Lee would apply for a debt relief programme since the debts were not incurred by Lee.[^47] However, Evelyn recalled that the letters which the banks kept sending to Lee upset him badly and, at one point in time, Lee had said, “Just pay the bank and the bank would not come and bother us.”.[^48]

##### OCBC’s evidence

46     According to Ms Rita Zahara Bte Ahmad Zahit, OCBC Vice-president (Card Operations), (“**Ms Rita**”) the OCBC Form, together with Lee’s NRIC and NOA, was submitted to OCBC in person at the People’s Park branch on 26 March 2010.[^49]

47     Believing that the application was made by Lee, OCBC processed the application and eventually approved the OCBC Facility with the issuance of the OCBC Titanium MasterCard number XXX but rejected the EasiCredit facility. All correspondence in relation to the OCBC Facility, including the rejection of the EasiCredit facility application and the Statements, were sent to the Accused’s Address.[^50]

##### CIMB’s evidence

48     Ms Wong Foong Har, CIMB Director (Compliance), (“**Ms Wong**”) and Mr Tiong Liang Chun, CIMB Vice-president (Credit Processing and Approval) (“**Mr Tiong**”) testified that CIMB had received the CIMB Form, together with a copy of Lee’s NRIC and Lee’s NOA dated 6 August 2007 (the “**NOA 2007**”) and, believing Lee to be the applicant, processed the application for the CIMB Facility on 22 March 2010. However, as the NOA 2007 was outdated, CIMB had called the applicant, ostensibly Lee, on the Unknown Mobile Number stated on the CIMB Form to request for the latest income document. There was no record of who answered the Unknown Mobile Number. Subsequently, Lee’s NOA dated 15 June 2009 (the “**NOA 2009**”) was faxed to CIMB and the application for the CIMB Facility was thereby approved with the issuance of the CIMB Platinum MasterCard number XXX.[^51]

49     According to Mr Tiong, applicants for credit facilities would be notified by short message service (“**SMS**”) or letter to the billing address. Based on the particulars provided in the CIMB Form, any SMS would have been sent to the Unknown Mobile Number and any letter would have been sent to the Accused’s Address.[^52]

##### End of the prosecution’s case

50     At the end of the prosecution’s case, the defence pointed out certain gaps and inconsistencies in the evidence of the prosecution’s witnesses and submitted that there was no case to answer. However, I was not persuaded that the minor flaws in the prosecution’s evidence, some of which could be attributed to memory lapses, were fatal at this stage of the proceedings.

51     On the contrary, I found that there was evidence, not inherently incredible, that satisfied each and every element of C2A and C1. Accordingly, I delivered the allocution in section 230(1)(m) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, Ed 2012) (the “**CPC**”) and called on the accused to enter his defence.

52     The accused elected to give evidence in his own defence.

## THE DEFENCE’S CASE

53     The key plank of the defence at trial is that the accused assisted to complete the Forms at Evelyn’s behest and with particulars provided by Evelyn. Thereafter, the accused had given the Forms to Evelyn for her to procure Lee’s signature.

54     The defence’s case was premised on the evidence of the accused and his administrative assistant, Tuan Eng Tin @ Veronica (“**Veronica**”).

##### The accused’s evidence

55     Between 2007 and 2010, the accused was working in the marketing division of Perazim where he provided marketing and consulting services. His scope of work included sourcing for new customers who were desirous of improving their business turnover and retaining customers.[^53] The accused earned a basic salary as well as commissions from Perazim.[^54]

56     According to the accused, he had made a cold call at the Health Centre in 2008 to offer his consulting services to Evelyn and frequently engaged Evelyn in discussions about the Health Centre’s business.[^55] Through their conversations, the accused learnt that business at the Health Centre was declining and facing financial woes. Additionally, Evelyn was having problems with an employee.

57     At Evelyn’s request, and even though there was no mention of fees, the accused agreed to help her with, amongst other things, the filing of a police report in relation to a rogue employee[^56] and a loan for the payment of a composition fine of $300 to the Central Provident Fund Board over late payment of Central Provident Fund (the “**CPF**”) contributions[^57].

58     The accused also testified that, over time, Evelyn and he agreed to collaborate on growing and expanding the Health Centre’s business (the “**Business Collaboration**”), which eventually also involved Lee and Veronica. The accused provided extensive details of how he, together with Evelyn and Veronica, sourced for new and larger premises and identified new equipment and products for the Business Collaboration.[^58] However, the accused had nothing to document the terms of the Business Collaboration or record the participation of Lee, Evelyn, Veronica and him.[^59] Furthermore, even though the accused claimed that Lee’s role was to fund the Business Collaboration, the accused’s evidence was tentative and ambivalent at times:[^60]

>   
| 

A

 | 

Your Honour, yes but when comes to collaboration, Your Honour, Mr. Lee Tuck Onn is already well aware. The only thing Lee Tuck Onn is not aware of is she, that is Evelyn Choo, asked Lee Tuck Onn to fund the certain obligation of the business collaboration, Your Honour. In fact, Lee Tuck Onn is aware that this business collaboration is mooted as well as the funding aspect, Your Honour. Your Honour, can I have a sip of water before I cough again?

 |

  
  

59     There was no evidence that the accused had received any assurance or committed directly from Lee in relation to the Business Collaboration.

60     Nevertheless, the accused told the court that pursuant to the Business Collaboration, he proceeded to make the applications for the Facilities. According to the accused, he had completed the Forms with particulars provided by Evelyn.[^61] For instance:

> (a)     Evelyn had told the accused that Lee’s mother’s maiden name was “Wong Siew Lan” (even though Evelyn had testified at trial that “Wong Siew Lan” was her mother’s maiden name);

> (b)     Evelyn had told the accused to state Perazim as Lee’s employer and to use Perazim’s address, _ie._ the Accused’s Address, as the correspondence or billing address.[^62]

61     The accused claimed that Evelyn had asked him to put the Accused’s Address as the correspondence or billing address since the Facilities were intended to be utilised for the Business Collaboration.[^63] In the same vein, after the CIMB Facility was approved, Evelyn had purportedly instructed the accused to hold on to the CIMB Platinum MasterCard credit card.[^64]

62     In this regard, even though the Facilities were purportedly for the use of the Business Collaboration, the accused was unable to provide any details, receipts, invoices or records of any of the transactions in the Statements, (_ie._ the OCBC Statements and the CIMB Statements). When asked by the prosecution during cross-examination, the accused incessantly referred to the purchase of health supplements and gadgets without providing any meaningful details such as the names of the health supplements and gadgets and specifically what they were to be for, including those purportedly purchased from Perazim.[^65] The accused went so far as to testify that all the receipts pertaining to the purchases had been misplaced, including records of purchases made with the Facilities.[^66] The accused also conceded that some of the small-value transactions were his personal expenses rather than expenditure for the Business Collaboration.[^67]

##### The accused’s statements

63     The prosecution adduced the following statements of the accused during cross-examination:

> (a)     The accused’s investigation statement recorded on 15 May 2015 by Insp Siaw (the “**1st Statement**”)[^68];

> (b)     The accused’s investigation statement recorded on 23 October 2015 recorded by Insp Siaw (the “**2nd Statement**”);[^69]

> (c)     The accused’s investigation statement recorded on 6 April 2016 recorded by Insp Siaw (“**3rd Statement**”);[^70] and

> (d)     The accused’s cautioned statements recorded on 2 November 2017 at 11:28 am (“**4th Statement**”),[^71] 12:00 pm (“**5th Statement**”)[^72] and 12:10 pm (“**6th Statement**”)[^73] by Insp Seow.

64     An ancillary hearing was held for the 2nd Statement and the 3rd Statement as the accused had challenged the voluntariness and admissibility of these statements (the “**Ancillary Hearing**”).

65     Insp Siaw was the only witness for the prosecution during the Ancillary Hearing and his evidence in relation to the procedure for the recording of the 2nd Statement and the 3rd Statement was not controversial. There was nothing to suggest that Insp Siaw did or said anything during the recording of the statements that could be construed as a threat, an inducement or a promise that tended to sap and had in fact sapped the will of the accused.

66     The only anomaly in Insp Siaw’s evidence was that the name of the accused stated in the 2nd Statement and the 3rd Statement was one “Chiew Soong Choy Simon” rather than the accused. This followed from the accused’s first meeting with Insp Siaw for the recording of the 1st Statement where the accused had identified himself as “Chiew Soong Choy Simon”. According to Insp Siaw, the actual name of the accused was uncovered only after a fingerprint verification was conducted when the accused was arrested.[^74]

67     The accused, who was the only witness for the defence, alleged that IO Siaw had told the accused not to “complicate matters” and that he (_ie._ IO Siaw) will help the accused settle the criminal charges.[^75] However, the accused did not aver that his will was thereby sapped when gave or signed on the statements. For instance:[^76]

>   
| 

Q (by prosecution)

 | 

Yes. So, Mr Chew, surely, you must have been upset at the very least that IO Siaw wanted you to agree to something you had not said, right?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Your Honour, at that moment, really don’t know why I did not upset, I’m just worried that he will not fulfil the obligation that he has stated to cooperate closely with him, that he will drop the matter, that the case close, and the thing resolved. I’m only worried about that. The rest, I have no worry.

68     Conversely, if all that the accused wanted to do was to cooperate with IO Siaw, there was nothing to stop him from doing so by just giving the 2nd Statement and the 3rd Statement truthfully. IO Siaw did not ask the accused to lie or incriminate himself and there was nothing to suggest that the accused felt compelled to lie or incriminate himself.

69     Moreover, given that the 3rd Statement was recorded some five to six months after the 2nd Statement, if the accused was indeed labouring under any self-induced illusion that the police and/or Lee will not pursue matter against the accused if he “cooperated” with IO Siaw during the recording of the 2nd Statement, it would have become patently clear by the time he gave the 3rd Statement that this was not to be. Consequently, as far as the 3rd Statement was concerned, it was inexplicable and illogical for the accused to still have had the misguided belief that he had anything to gain by giving the statement against his will.[^77]

70     At the end of the Ancillary Hearing, I found that the accused’s allegations were nothing more than bare assertions that lacked particularity and were devoid of merit. I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that nothing transpired during the recording of the 2nd Statement and the 3rd Statement that could have constituted threat, inducement or promise, or, for any other reason, lead to the accused’s will being sapped when he gave the statements. Accordingly, I admitted the 2nd Statement and the 3rd Statement into evidence at the main trial.

71     Given that the accused had raised similar grounds (as those for challenging the voluntariness of the 2nd Statement and the 3rd Statement) for disputing the accuracy of certain paragraphs of the 2nd Statement and the 3rd Statement, it followed from my finding in the Ancillary Hearing that the accused’s claims that certain paragraphs of the 2nd Statement and the 3rd Statement were not his words should similarly be rejected.

72     Having admitted the 2nd Statement and the 3rd Statement into evidence at trial, I set out the material parts of the 2nd Statement, 3rd Statement and the 4th Statement (which was not disputed) below:

73     The accused’s admissions in the 2nd Statement, the 3rd Statement and the 4th Statement (collectively, the “**Material Statements**”) that he had signed on the Forms and that he had not obtained Lee’s authorisation to do so were clear and unequivocal. It was also noteworthy that the 4th Statement was a statement recorded under section 23(1) of the CPC and with the following notice administered to the accused:

>     “Do you want to say anything about the charge that was just read to you? If you keep quiet now about any fact or matter in your defence and you reveal this fact or matter in your defence only at your trial, the judge may be less likely to believe you. This may have a bad effect on your case in court. Therefore, it may be better for you to mention such fact or matter now. If you wish to do so, what you say will be written down, read back to you for any mistakes to be corrected and then signed by you.”

74     Even though the charge in the 4th Statement was not the subject of the present case, the accused repeated it for the 5th Statement and the 6th Statement, which were statements recorded under section 23(1) CPC in relation to C2A and C1.

##### The accused’s attempt to pass off as someone else during investigations

75     Next, I considered the accused’s act of passing off as “Chiew Soong Choy Simon” when he first met Insp Siaw for the 1st Statement and, subsequently, when he gave the 2nd Statement and the 3rd Statement.

76     On more than one occasion during cross-examination, the accused denied that he was lying to Insp Siaw even though he conceded that his name was not “Chiew Soong Choy Simon”:[^78]

Q (by prosecution)

 | 

Now, Mr. Chew, refer again to the 1st page of P20 \[_ie._ The 2nd Statement\] now. The statement dated 23rd of October 2015. The name you provided to IO Siaw Kah Swee was Chiew Soong Choy Simon. This is a lie, correct?

 |
| 

A

 | 

No, Your Honour. As the first call that I received from IO---

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Mr. Chew, I’m asking you very specifically about the name in P20. Chiew Soong Choy Simon. Is that your name?

 |
| 

A

 | 

No, Your Honour.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, that is a lie, correct? Yes or no,---

 |
| 

A

 | 

No,---

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Mr. Chew?

 |
| 

A

 | 

No, Your Honour.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, are you telling the Court you’re also known by Chiew Soong Choy Simon?

 |
| 

A

 | 

No, Your Honour.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Now, the NRIC number that you have provided here, is that your NRIC number?

 |
| 

A

 | 

No, Your Honour.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, this is also a lie, right?

 |
| 

A

 | 

No, Your Honour.

 |

  
  

77     Despite being given a number of opportunities to explain why he had not used his real name, the accused’s explanations were evasive and unintelligible.[^79] For instance, even though the accused claimed that he initially thought that the investigations related to “Chiew Soong Choy Simon” and he wanted to find out more, he did not clarify his true identity after he found out that the investigations concerned him instead. Inexplicably, the accused explained that he did not have the chance to tell Insp Siaw his real name despite meeting Insp Siaw even when the 3rd Statement was recorded about five to six months later.[^80]

78     At one point in time, the accused even suggested that he did not see the need to identify himself since Insp Siaw had asked for “Chiew Soong Choy Simon”:[^81]

>   
| 

Q

 | 

When he \[_ie._ Insp Siaw\] asked you for your name, you gave IO Siaw another name. Yes or no?

 |
| 

A

 | 

He asked me for Chiew Soong Choy. Never ask me for my name, Your Honour.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Is that your name, Mr Chiew? Chiew Soong Choy Simon?

 |
| 

A

 | 

No, Your Honour.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, this is a lie, right?

 |
| 

A

 | 

If---Your Honour, if that’s the case then this is a lie.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, Mr Chew, you were pretending to be one Chiew Soong Choy Simon with NRIC number \[REDACTED\] during this statement, correct---statement recording, yes or no?

 |
| 

A

 | 

No, Your Honour.

 |

  
  

79     The accused’s persistent denials that he was not lying when he gave the 1st Statement, the 2nd Statement and the 3rd Statement as “Chiew Soong Choy Simon” demonstrated his propensity to be excessively liberal with the truth, his inability to differentiate fact from fiction or his attempt to evade detection.

##### Veronica’s evidence

80     Veronica testified that she was working for Perazim as an administrative assistant to the accused at the material time.

81     Veronica testified that she had seen the accused fill up the OCBC Form at his office and had asked Evelyn to bring the completed form home for Lee to sign.[^82] The accused had made photocopies of Lee’s NRIC and the NOA to be attached to the OCBC Form[^83] but Veronica did not know who eventually signed on the OCBC Form.

82     Aside from the OCBC Form, Veronica testified that she could not recognise or remember many of the other forms that were exhibited at trial and shown to her, including the CIMB Form. Subsequently, it transpired that Veronica had merely assumed that Evelyn had asked the accused to fill up the forms since Evelyn “always come to office and she always says if she needs help with filling up anything, she would say, “Simon \[_ie._ the accused\]”.[^84]

83     When Veronica’s attention was directed to the Unknown Mobile Number that appeared on the Forms, Veronica again assumed that it belonged to Lee although she did not know it as a fact.

84     In relation to the CIMB Form, Veronica did not know why her name and telephone number appeared in the form as the emergency contact person.[^85]

85     Veronica testified that she was involved in the Business Collaboration and that she and the accused had met Lee on at least 2 occasions to discuss the Business Collaboration during which time Lee had told the accused to handle everything. However, Veronica’s evidence came across as tentative and lacking in granularity, and she frequently had to correct or qualify herself when giving evidence. For instance, even though Veronica had alluded to the Business Collaboration many times, she eventually told the court that the Business Collaboration was only at the stage of discussions and had not yet taken off.[^86]

86     When pressed for documentary proof of the Business Collaboration, Veronica was adamant that it was contained in the letter of authorisation signed by Evelyn in favour of “Simon Chiew” and witnessed by Veronica (the “**LOA**”)[^87] even though the LOA was clearly not such a document and made no reference to Lee:[^88]

>   
| 

Q

 | 

Does Lee Tuck Onn’s name appear on this document? Yes or no?

 |
| 

A

 | 

No.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So there is absolutely nothing mentioned in this document about your business collaboration, correct?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Cooperation. It should had stated “Carol \[_ie._ Evelyn\] would have agreed to us collaborating”. How should I say this? Under cooperation, in the form of collaboration, I don’t know how to say it.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Ms. Tuan, you don’t know how to say it because there’s nothing mentioned on this document---document about the business collaboration. Agree?

 |
| 

A

 | 

We did collaborate but the way we write might be different.

 |

  
  

87     Subsequently, Veronica retracted her evidence and admitted that it was the accused who had told her that the LOA was documentary proof of the Business Collaboration:[^89]

>   
| 

Q

 | 

So, your understanding of this document is based solely on what Simon told you. Is that right?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes, that’s right.

 |

  
  

88     Subsequently, Veronica conceded that there was, in fact, no documentary proof of the Business Collaboration and that the parties had entered into the Business Collaboration verbally.[^90]

89     In the course of Veronica’s cross-examination, the prosecution sought to produce Veronica’s statement that was given to Insp Siaw on 17 December 2015 at 1200 hours (“**Veronica’s Statement**”)[^91] on the basis of inconsistencies with her oral testimony in court.

90     Being satisfied that there were material inconsistencies between Veronica’s Statement and Veronica’s oral testimony, I allowed the prosecution to cross-examine Veronica on the statement and subsequently admitted the statement pursuant to section 147 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, Rev Ed 1997) (the “**EA**”).

91     The material paragraphs of Veronica’s Statement were as follows:

>     …

> 6.    \[The accused\] then prepared one Authorisation Letter and asked \[Evelyn\] to come to his offence. When \[Evelyn\] to the office, \[the accused\] then spoke to \[Evelyn\] regarding the said Authorisation Letter content and I was there helping him to translate into Mandarin for \[Evelyn\] to understand. After explaining the content details, \[Evelyn\] then signed willingly on the said letter and I signed on the letter as a witness.

> 7.    After signing the Authorisation letter, \[Evelyn\] brought her personal documents, her NRIC and her husband NRIC. She then informed \[the accused\] that she has no money but can use her husband NRIC to apply for the said bank credit cards. All documents were handed over to \[the accused\]. Subsequently, whatever happened to them I am not so sure about it.

> 8.    Only recently when \[the accused\] was called up by the police for investigation and he briefly just tell me that \[Evelyn\] claims that she does not know him so well. As far as I can recall, I only know that \[Evelyn\] has brought her husband credit card to our office and \[the accused\] has helped her swipe the cards to help her pay the money back to loanshark. I only heard so but I am not too sure as well.

> _6\. (sic_)    The following questions are posed to me:

>     …

> Q3)    Do you know who sign for the OCBC credit card application form?

> A3)    No I do not know.

>     …

> Q5)    Do you know who sign for the CIMB credit card application form?

> A5)    I do not know.

> Q6)    Do you have anything else to add?

> A5)    I do not know what actually happen in between \[the accused\] and \[Evelyn\]. I am just doing my administrative work for \[the accused\]. That’s all.

92     Despite the obvious inconsistencies between Veronica’s oral testimony and Veronica’s Statement, for instance, the extent of Veronica’s involvement in and knowledge of the Business Collaboration as well as the purport of the LOA which Evelyn had executed in favour of the accused, Veronica vehemently denied any inconsistencies. Instead, Veronica claimed that her statement was not accurately recorded as Insp Siaw had not read it back to her[^92] and that she would not have understood it anyway since it was recorded in English, a language which she was not proficient in.

93     Finally, at some point during cross-examination, Veronica alluded to the accused speaking with her prior to her coming to court to give evidence but became very evasive when questioned as to when the accused spoke with her and what the accused spoke with her about:[^93]

>   
| 

Q

 | 

…Now, earlier when I asked you about this introduction in 2008, you mentioned that Simon told you about this incident. So, when did Simon tell you about this incident in 2008?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Is it regarding me coming here to Court?

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

A

 | 

Should be earlier. He mentioned---Simon mentioned he---he didn’t mention.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Ms. Tuan, you are contradicting yourself. You literally just said he mentioned, and then you said he didn’t mention. So, which is it?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I forgot.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

You forgot which part, Ms. Tuan? He mentioned or he didn’t mention?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Should be so. He did mention.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And when did he mention it?

 |
| 

A

 | 

When we were coming to Court. Not today, previously.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

When if you have to estimate.

 |
| 

A

 | 

When he mentioned about he has to come to Court.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, before Simon had to come to Court, he told you about this 2008 incident when he had introduced Carol to you, is that right?

 |
| 

A

 | 

He did not say anything to me on that day. It’s just him introducing to me in 2008.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

No, Mi---Ms. Tuan, please listen carefully. You have told this Court that Simon mentioned the 2008 incident when he introduced Carol to you. You have also told this Court that he told you about this before he came to trial. So, when exactly before trial did he tell you about this incident?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Did I say that \[the accused\] mention this?

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

A

 | 

I only said \[the accused\] introduced, right?

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Ms. Tuan, I will put it to you that you are changing your evidence. Agree or disagree?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I forgot. Did I change?

 |
| 

Q

 | 

It’s an agree or disagree question, Ms. Tuan.

 |
| 

A

 | 

I forgot. Hard to say.

 |

  
  

94     In the course of Veronica’s cross-examination, the court had also observed the accused glaring at Veronica on a number of occasions when Veronica was giving evidence. This observation was made known to the defence and prosecution during the prosecution’s cross-examination of Veronica.[^94]

## ASSESSMENT OF THE EVIDENCE

95     The challenge in this case laid not in the subject-matter _per se_ but in the inherent complexity of the four main characters who had given evidence in court, namely, Lee, Evelyn, Veronica and the accused. Additionally, there was an apparent lacuna in the prosecution’s case as the OCBC 1st Telephone Call took place on 22 June 2010, before Lee received any statement of account or letter of demand from OCBC and CIMB.

96     As far as Lee’s evidence was concerned, it was clear and unequivocal that he was not aware of the Forms and that he did not sign on the Forms. In fact, the signatures on the Forms were clearly quite different from Lee’s signature on the CIMB Platinum MasterCard credit card application form dated 12 June 2010 which was a _bona fide_ application by Lee.[^95] It followed that Lee could not have authorised the submission of the Forms for the Facilities since he knew nothing about them.

97     Turning to Evelyn, I found her to be a disingenuous witness who was prone to distancing herself from the accused and downplaying the extent to which the accused was helping her to raise money to expand the Health Centre. Evidence to the contrary was stated in Evelyn’s First Report:

>     … At the end of February, he suggested that we could loan money from the bank, OCBC, to rent another bigger shop. As such, he said that he need my NRIC and my husband NRIC, namely Lee Tuck Onn, \[REDACTED\]. He claims that he would settle paper work by himself and would inform us when everything is settle. He returned my NRIC after one week but he kept my husband NRIC and gave a reason that it is easier for him to produce the NRIC when the bank needs it. …

98     Additionally, even though Evelyn had vehemently denied hiring the accused as a consultant for the Health Centre, there was clearly some form of engagement between Evelyn and the accused, as Evelyn had mentioned in Evelyn’s 1st Report that “\[o\]n the 01 Jan 2010, I hired a Business Consultant, namely Simon, to help me to manage my Shop (You Xian Beauty & Health Centre)” and in Evelyn’s 2nd Report that “I wish to state that I am not very good in business and he had told me that he could help me in expanding my business.”

99     Evelyn’s evidence was largely self-serving which might have been partially fuelled by anger that she clearly still harboured against the accused. At one point, Evelyn even went to the extent of testifying that _a man_ had told her that the accused was involved in similar cheating scams but failed to provide the identity or details of the man.

100    Although ostensibly lacking in sophistication, the accused came across as an experienced and seasoned businessman. He was a calm and composed witness who was never hurried into answering a question. He took his time to digest each question and thought about the answer before speaking.

101    Wading in a sea of objective evidence that was clearly not in his favour, the accused was relentless, during the trial, in his futile attempt to build a defence that was inherently fraught with internal and external inconsistencies. The following were just some examples:

> (a)     Even though the accused claimed that the Facilities were intended for the Business Collaboration, he could not satisfactorily account for a single transaction in the Statements that could be tied back to the Business Collaboration.

> (b)     Even though some of the supplements or gadgets were procured from Perazim, the accused’s employer at the material time, the accused was hard put to name any one of them.

> (c)     Even though some five to six months transpired between the recording of the 2nd Statement and the 3rd Statement, the accused claimed that he did not have the opportunity to inform Insp Siaw that his name was not “Chiew Soong Choy, Simon”.

102    On the contrary, the Material Statements collectively painted a more coherent picture of what exactly transpired between Evelyn and the accused that led to the accused submitting them to OCBC and CIMB for the Facilities. Notably, even though the accused had mounted a challenge against the voluntariness and accuracy of the 2nd Statement and the 3rd Statement, the material incriminating portions of these two statements were also found in the 4th Statement (repeated in the 5th Statement and the 6th Statement) which was not challenged by the accused:

>     …

> 5)    As regarding the filling up of the application, I was ask to assist to fill up which I did so out of friendship.

> 6)    Finally when all is fill-up, I ask her to sign but she say since I am willing to assist for the sake of this business collaboration, I went ahead to do as requested by her.

103    In the 2nd Statement, 3rd Statement and 4th Statement, there was nothing to suggest that the accused had bothered to check if Lee was aware of or authorised the applications when the accused signed on the Forms.

104    Finally, I turn to Veronica’s evidence which I found to be lacking in depth and largely devoid of details or particularity.

105    In relation to Veronica’s Statement, notwithstanding Veronica’s allegations that the statement was not read back to her and that she could not understand the contents which were in English, IO Siaw had testified that the statement was, in fact, recorded in Mandarin after he found out that she was more proficient in Mandarin. According to IO Siaw, he had merely failed to update the particulars on the first page of Veronica’s Statement.

106    I found Veronica’s allegations against IO Siaw to be without merit. Foremost, Veronica failed to particularise the objectionable paragraphs in the statement. In this regard, I was mindful that the first few paragraphs as well as Q1)/A1) and Q2)/A2) of paragraph 6 of Veronica’s Statement contained personal information that could only have been known to Veronica at the time that IO Siaw recorded the statement. Furthermore, no reason was given as to why IO Siaw would want Veronica to give a false statement given that Veronica was just a witness and there was nothing incriminating in Veronica’s Statement.

107    Therefore, I found that Veronica’s credit had been impeached pursuant to section 157 of the EA.

108    I was also troubled by Veronica’s evidence that the accused had spoken with her before she came to court to testify and Veronica’s refusal thereafter to divulge any further details of when they met and what they spoke about, despite repeated questioning by the prosecution. There was a serious risk that Veronica’s oral testimony at trial had been compromised by false memories or suggestions resulting from any discussion that she might have had with the accused prior to coming to court.[^96] My reservation over Veronica’s evidence was further compounded by my observation that the accused had glared at Veronica for a prolonged period of time during cross-examination. As such, I attributed little weight to Veronica’s evidence.

109    Finally, I considered the apparent lacuna in the prosecution’s case since the OCBC 1st Telephone Call took place on 22 June 2010, before Lee received any correspondence from OCBC and CIMB in relation to the Facilities.

110    The prosecution suggested that Lee must have received a statement from OCBC that was similar to the consolidated statement of account dated 28 February 2011 which OCBC had sent to Lee at his residential address.[^97] (In this regard, it is important to mention that by 28 February 2011, OCBC had already updated the correspondence address for the OCBC Facility to Lee’s Address.) I rejected such a suggestion as it was highly speculative given that there was not a shred of evidence that such a document existed before 28 February 2011.

111    Instead, it was more plausible that, by June 2010, Evelyn was already aware that the accused was utilising Evelyn’s and/or Lee’s bank facilities, without Lee’s knowledge, to raise money for the Health Centre. As pointed out above, Evelyn had expressly mentioned this in Evelyn’s 1st Report and Evelyn’s 2nd Report. As such, it would not have been surprising for her to have made the OCBC 1st Telephone Call if she had wanted to stop the accused from continuing to use the bank facilities. This would have inadvertently led to the discovery of the OCBC Facility that the accused had fraudulently applied for.

112    Nonetheless, the evidence adduced by the parties was inadequate for a finding to be made in relation to the apparent lacuna. In contrast, there was an abundance of other evidence that proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had, without Lee’s knowledge or authorisation, filled up and signed the Forms and submitted them to OCBC and CIMB, as the case may be, for the grant of the OCBC Facility and the CIMB Facility.

113    Therefore, I found that the prosecution had proven C2A and C1 against the accused beyond reasonable doubt and I convicted the accused of both charges.

## THE CHARGES THAT THE ACCUSED PLEADED GUILTY TO

114    Following the conviction for C2A and C1, the accused elected to plead guilty to the following three charges under section 177 PC:

> (a)     That the accused, on 15 May 2015, at or about 1215 hours, at Central Police Division, Police Cantonment Complex, Singapore, being legally bound to furnish information on his name, date of birth and NRIC number to Insp Siah, a public servant, in a statement recorded from the accused under section 22 of the CPC, did furnish, as true, information which the accused knew to be false, to wit, that his name was Chiew Soong Choy, born on 1 September 1969 with NRIC number XXX (“**P1**”);

> (b)     That the accused, on 6 April 2016, at or about 1100 hours, at Central Police Division, Police Cantonment Complex, Singapore, being legally bound to furnish information on his name, date of birth and NRIC number to Insp Siah, a public servant, in a statement recorded from the accused under section 22 of the CPC, did furnish, as true, information which the accused knew to be false, to wit, that his name was Chiew Soong Choy, born on 1 September 1969 with NRIC number XXX (“**P2**”); and

> (c)     That the accused, on 27 May 2016, at or about 1140 hours, at Central Police Division, Police Cantonment Complex, Singapore, being legally bound to furnish information on his name, date of birth and NRIC number to Insp Siah, a public servant, in a statement recorded from the accused under section 22 of the CPC, did furnish, as true, information which the accused knew to be false, to wit, that his name was Chiew Soong Choy, born on 1 September 1969 with NRIC number XXX (“**P3**”).

115    The accused consented to three other similar charges under section 177 PC being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

116    The statement of facts in relation to P1, P2 and P3 were as follows:

> **A**.     **The Parties**

> 1.    The accused is Chew Kong Heng, a 62-year-old Malaysian National (Singapore Permanent Resident), bearing NRIC No. XXX, D.O.B. 14 July 1958. B. Background Facts First Information Report.

> **B**.     **Background Facts**

>      **_First Information Report_**

> 2.    On 27 May 2016, at or about 5.27pm, Staff Sergeant Mohammad Muhaily bin Suramin (“SSGT Muhaily”) lodged an arrest report stating that, whilst performing his duties in the regional lock up at Police Cantonment Complex (“PCC”) that day, he had placed the accused under arrest for using another person’s NRIC and seized one blue NRIC in the name of Chiew Soong Choy (NRIC no. XXX).

>      **_Background Facts_**

> 3.    Investigations revealed that in 2010 and 2011, one Mdm. Evelyn Choo (“Evelyn”) and her husband, Lee Tuck Onn (“Lee”), lodged several police reports against the accused alleging that the accused had misused Lee’s particulars to apply for credit cards and credit facilities with several banks without their knowledge or consent.

> 4.    Pursuant to the police reports that were lodged by Evelyn and Lee, the police commenced investigations against the accused for possible offences under section 468 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”).

> **C**.     **Facts Pertaining to the 4th Charge: MAC 911292/107**

> 5.    On 15 May 2015, Investigation Officer Siaw Kah Swee (“IO Siaw”) of the Singapore Police Force requested the accused to come down to Central Police Division, PCC. Thereat, on or about 12.15pm, IO Siaw commenced the recording of a statement from the accused pursuant to section 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”). Under section 22 of the CPC, the accused was legally bound to state truly what he knew of the facts and circumstances of the case.

> 6.    Despite this, when asked by IO Siaw for his personal particulars during a police investigation, the accused furnished false information to a public servant, IO Siaw, by falsely stating that his name was “Chiew Soong Choy”, that he was born on 1 September 1969, and that his NRIC number was XXX. The accused did so to prevent his true identity from being discovered by the police and to avoid being implicated in the police’s investigations for the section 468 Penal Code offences.

> 7.    The statement recording ended at 2.20pm whereupon the accused read through his statement and signed on every page, confirming the false personal particulars that he had provided to IO Siaw and the contents of the statement.

> 8.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has thereby committed an offence under section 177 of the Penal Code.

> **D**.     **Facts Pertaining to the 6th Charge: MAC 911294/2017**

> 9.    On 6 April 2016, IO Siaw requested the accused to come down to Central Police Division, PCC again. Thereat, on or about 11.00am, IO Siaw commenced the recording of a statement from the accused pursuant to section 22 of the CPC. Under section 22 of the CPC, the accused was legally bound to state truly what he knew of the facts and circumstances of the case.

> 10.    Despite this, when asked by IO Siaw for his personal particulars during a police investigation, the accused furnished false information to a public servant, IO Siaw, by falsely stating that his name was “Chiew Soong Choy” and that his NRIC number was XXX. The accused did so to prevent his true identity from being discovered by the police and to avoid being implicated in the police’s investigations for the section 468 Penal Code offences.

> 11.    The statement recording ended at 12.35 pm whereupon the accused read through his statement and signed on every page, confirming the false personal particulars that he had provided to IO Siaw and the contents of the statement.

> 12.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has thereby committed an offence under section 177 of the Penal Code.

> **E**.     **Facts Pertaining to the 7th Charge: MAC 911295/2017**

> 13.    On 27 May 2016, the accused again turned up at PCC as requested by IO Siaw. Thereat, IO Siaw informed the accused that investigations into the section 468 PC offences had completed, and that he would be recording the accused’s cautioned statements pursuant to section 23 of the CPC and producing him in court thereafter.

> 14.    On or about 11.40 am, IO Siaw commenced the recording of the accused’s first cautioned statement. IO Siaw drafted the personal particulars section in the statement according to what the accused had provided in his previous interviews, and went through these particulars with the accused to confirm their accuracy. Despite being legally bound to state truly his identity and personal particulars, the accused informed IO Siaw that his name was “Chiew Soong Choy”, that he was born on 1 September 1969, and that his NRIC number was XXX.

> 15.    Thereafter, IO Siaw administered the Notice in Writing to the accused and the accused proceeded to write his defence to the first section 468 PC charge down, omitting any mention about his true identity. The accused signed on every page of the cautioned statement, and the statement recording concluded at 12.45pm.

> 16.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has thereby committed an offence under section 177 of the Penal Code.

> **F**.     **Conclusion**

> 17.    After the recording of the accused’s two remaining cautioned statements had concluded on 27 May 2016, IO Siaw placed the accused under arrest and brought him to the lock up in PCC. The accused’s fingerprints were processed, whereupon IO Siaw and SSGT Muhaily discovered that the accused’s identity was in fact “Chew Kong Heng”, with date of birth 14 July 1958, and NRIC number XXX. At no point during the charging process did the accused retract the false information that he had provided to IO Siaw.

> 18.    Investigations commenced soon after into the accused’s misuse of Chiew Soong Choy’s (“Chiew”) identity. Investigations revealed that the accused and the genuine Chiew had been friends for about ten years when Chiew entrusted his NRIC to Chew around April 2015 for the accused to help Chiew in matters relating to the filing of his company’s annual returns and income taxes. Chiew was unaware that the accused had used his identity and NRIC during investigations into the accused’s section 468 Penal Code offences.

> 19.    The accused was subsequently charged in court on 6 November 2017 for the section 468 Penal Code offences and section 177 Penal Code offences.

> 20.    The accused stands charged for the above offences.

## SENTENCING

117    The accused was untraced.

118    In sentencing the accused, I agreed with the prosecution that deterrence was the prominent sentencing consideration for the charges under section 468 and section 177 PC.

119    As far as C2A and C1 were concerned, there was a high degree of pre-meditation and personal gain. Based on the evidence adduced during trial, the prosecution and the defence came up with their respective calculations of the loss that flowed from C2A and C1. I recognised that this must have been a difficult exercise given that the OCBC Facility and the CIMB Facility were essentially revolving credit facilities which were drawn down and partially re-paid over time. There were also interest charges, penalties and other fees imposed by the banks for the late payment of the overdue amounts. Nonetheless, the calculations of the prosecution and the defence were not too far apart as concerned sentencing and I adopted the figure of $1,970 for C2A and $9,593.63 for C1 in sentencing.

120    Taking into account the sentencing precedents provided by the prosecution in its sentencing submissions, which were not controversial and were not disputed by the defence, I imposed the following sentences:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="18.38%"> <col width="51.66%"> <col width="29.96%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentence</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Remarks</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>C2A</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">8 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Concurrent</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>C1</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">14 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Consecutive</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>C3A</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">1 month’s imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Consecutive</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>C4A</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">1 month’s imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Concurrent</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>C5A</b></p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">1 month’s imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Concurrent</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

121    Taking into account the different legally-protected interests, I ordered the sentences for C1 and C3A to run consecutively, giving rise to a global sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment which did not offend the totality principle and which I decided would meet the justice of this case.

122    I further considered that compensation was not an appropriate order to make in this case given the impecuniosity of the accused which could be inferred from the evidence present at trial.
