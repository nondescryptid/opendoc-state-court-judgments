### District Judge Luke Tan:

## Introduction

1       The accused, Faizal bin Mustaffa, a 34-year-old male Singaporean, pleaded guilty to three charges as follows: one charge of rioting under s 147 of the Penal Code, Cap 224, punishable under (p/u) s 50T(1)(_a_) of the Prisons Act (Cap. 247, 2000 Rev. Ed.) (‘**rioting charge’**), one charge of voluntarily causing hurt with common intention under s 323 r/w s 34 of the Penal Code p/u s 50T(1)(_a_) of the Prisons Act **(**‘**VCH charge’**), and one charge under s 47AA(2)(_a_) of the CDSA Corruption, Drug Trafficking and other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (CDSA), which was amalgamated pursuant to s 124(4) and punishable under s 124(8) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (‘**CDSA charge’**). These three charges are collectively referred to as the ‘**proceeded charges**’.

2       In addition, there were two other charges under section 34(7)(a) of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020 (No. 14 of 2020) that were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing (‘**TIC charges**’).

3       The offences set out in the rioting and VCH charges occurred on the same date and involved the same victim. Nevertheless, they were distinct in that there was a break in time between the two offences, with the rioting charge occurring first, and at a slightly different location from VCH charge. The latter also involved three offenders, rather than five offenders for the rioting charge. As for the CDSA charge, it involved the accused’s illicit use of public funds which had originally been set aside for self-employed persons affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

4       The Prosecution sought a global sentence of 68 to 76 months’ imprisonment plus six strokes of the cane for the principal offences, with an additional enhanced sentence of 476 days’ imprisonment in relation to the accused’s breach of his remission order connected with the rioting charge. The Defence asked for a global sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment and $6,000 fine for the principal offences, with an additional enhanced sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment in relation to the accused’s breach of his remission order.

5       After considering the detailed facts of the case, and the comprehensive arguments put forward by the Prosecution and the Defence, I sentenced the accused to an aggregate sentence of 58 months’ imprisonment plus an enhanced sentence of 476 days' imprisonment, with effect from 17-November-2020, and also to six strokes of the cane. The sentence breakdown was as follows:

6       The accused being dissatisfied, has filed an appeal against sentence. I now give the reasons for my decision.

## Summary of Facts

8       The Prosecution put up a very comprehensive 9-page statement of facts (SOF). I have summarised the main aspects of the SOF below.

### Rioting and VCH offences on 15 November 2020

#### Facts pertaining to the rioting charge

9       The co-accused persons are:

> a.     Mohamad Effendi Bin Murad (“**Effendi**”)

> b.     Muhammad Danish Al’Aqib Bin Noordin (“**Danish**”).

> c.     Muhammad Zulqarnain bin Suhami (“**Zul**”).

> d.     Salman bin Abu Samah (“**Salman**”).

10     The victim is Ibrahim Bin Omar, a 62-year-old male Singaporean (D.O.B. 18 November 1959). He was 60 years old at the material time.

11     The accused, the co-accused persons, and the victim were gang members of ‘Salakau 369’ (the “**Gang**”). The victim was the headman of the Gang, and Salman was directly under him, while the accused was the headman of the Kallang Airport division of the Gang. Danish, Zul, and Effendi were under the accused in the Kallang Airport division.

12     The witnesses are:

> a.     Zulkiflee Bin Raafioon (“**Zulkiflee**”).

> b.     Hamidah Binte Khir (“**Hamidah**”).

> c.     Zahari Bin Rosmadi (“**Zahari**”).

> d.     Putri Nur Syafirah Binte Rosdi (“**Putri**”). Putri was Effendi’s girlfriend at the material time.

> e.     Nur Syuhadah Binte Roland Rosmadi (“**Syuhadah**”). Syuhadah is Zahari’s sister.

> f.     Muhammad Zulkarnain Bin Zolkiple (“**Zolkiple**”).

13     On 15 November 2020, at about 9.30am, one Shukor bin Ghani (the “**Complainant**”) was walking along the void deck of Block 9, North Bridge Road, Singapore 190009 (“**the Block**”) when he saw the victim lying motionless beside a rubbish chute, between lobby A of the Block and St. Andrew’s Senior Care (JOY Connect). The victim was observed by the Complainant to have suffered facial injuries, and was spotted with dried blood on his face, near his nose. His belongings were strewn on the floor around him and there was an empty ‘Chivas’ liquor bottle in close proximity to the victim’s head. The Complainant made a ‘999’ call. On the same date, one Johnny Neo also made a ‘999’ phone call to report on the victim whom he discovered lying on the floor. Another witness, Zulkiflee, also chanced on the victim lying motionless on the floor, although he did not call the authorities.

14     Before the incident, the victim was living with his stepsister, Hamidah, a 52-year-old female Singaporean at a unit at Block 1 Spooner Road (“**the Flat**”). On or around early November 2020, the victim and Hamidah had an argument at the Flat regarding the victim being involved with drugs at the Flat. As a result of the argument, the victim allegedly slapped Hamidah and threatened to stab her with a knife. Hamidah then chased the victim out of the Flat, causing the victim great inconvenience in having to live at budget hostels.

15     Subsequently, Hamidah confided in Salman about what the victim had done to her. Salman became close to Hamidah and treated her like a mother. Hamidah even allowed Salman to reside with her at the Flat. The victim was unhappy about this arrangement, while Salman was indebted to Hamidah. Salman also introduced Hamidah to the accused. On 13 November 2020, Danish and the accused visited Salman and Hamidah at the Flat.

16     Salman and the victim also had past grievances because the victim owed money to Salman. Salman thus wanted to avenge Hamidah, whom he called ‘Mami’, for the victim’s acts of violence towards her.

17     On 14 November 2020, at around 8.00pm, the accused and the co-accused persons, as well as Hamidah, Zahari, Putri, Syuhadah and Zolkiple were at a pub to celebrate Zahari’s birthday. There, Salman received several calls from the victim. The latter persistently asked Salman (who used to work as a pimp) for _inter alia_, prostitutes, sex enhancement pills, and to pay for his hotel rooms. Salman subsequently declined the victim’s calls, and the group adjourned to Zahari’s house, located at the Block to continue drinking. By then, the group had shared two bottles of ‘Chivas’ liquor and some of the members were drunk. Except for Zahari, members of the group continued to indulge in drinking, joined from time to time by Putri, Syuhadah and Zolkiple.

18     Subsequently, as the victim was not able to get hold of Salman on his mobile phone, he began calling the accused instead. Both the accused and Salman became angry at the victim’s persistence, and Salman eventually told the victim to meet them at the Block to settle their affairs. At this time, Effendi, Danish and Zul agreed to partake in the plan against the victim.

19     The victim arrived at the void deck of the Block on 15 November 2020 at about 1.45am and contacted Salman. Salman asked Danish and Effendi to accompany him to the ground floor. He also explained to Danish and Effendi that he wanted to teach the victim a lesson because of what the victim had done to Hamidah. At about 1.46am, Danish, Effendi and Salman walked towards the victim. They chose a location away from the CCTV to meet up with the victim, as they knew that the argument would turn aggressive.

20     At 1.47am, Zolkiple, on the accused’s instructions, took the staircase down and joined the trio to bring up any of the victim’s accompanying friends. After meeting the victim, Zolkiple left and went up to level 2 and was subsequently not involved in the attacks against the victim.

21     Danish then started to confront the victim about what the latter had done to Hamidah, before throwing the first punch at the victim’s face. This caused the victim to fall backwards and become unconscious. At around the same time, the accused and Zul joined the trio, forming an unlawful assembly with the common object to voluntarily cause hurt to the victim.

22     All five of them then surrounded the victim and punched and kicked him. The following acts of violence were noted:

> a.     Danish kicked the victim on his left shoulder and head. He also knelt down and gave the victim one more punch to his face.

> b.     Salman kicked the victim at his thigh area while he was on the ground. He then repeatedly kicked the victim and also punched the victim on the right side of his face a few times. Salman also stepped on the victim’s face about three to four times.

> c.     Zul punched the victim’s face about two to three times, and knelt over the victim, sat on his stomach and rained punches on him.

> d.     The accused sat on the victim’s stomach and swung his right fist at the victim’s left cheek twice.

23     At about 1.51am, the accused and the co-accused persons went up to the level 2 via staircase and lift. They were laughing because the victim was snoring loudly which they found comical. They left the victim lying motionless at the void deck. At this point, the victim’s face was bleeding, and he was unconscious. When they were at the corridor, the accused told Hamidah in Malay, “Demi Mami” three times, meaning “For Mami”.

#### Facts pertaining to the VCH charge

24     At about 1.53am, Zul went down to level 1 with the intention of removing the victim from public sight and hiding his unconscious body. He dragged the victim by the T-shirt across the floor to an isolated corner near Joy Connect, away from POLCAMs. At around the same time, the accused and Salman took the staircase down and joined Zul at the isolated corner.

25     At the isolated corner, the following acts of violence were carried out:

> a.     Salman punched the victim a few times on his face and stepped hard on the victim’s face about three to four times. He also kicked the victim’s throat using the sole of his shoes about three times. The victim made choking noises as he received the kicks.

> b.     Zul punched the victim’s face about two to three times. He then knelt down on his right knee while the victim was lying on the floor and used his right knuckle to punch the victim twice on his nose. Zul also kicked the victim.

> c.     The accused sat on the victim’s stomach and gave him a backhanded slap. He also used his right elbow to strike the victim once at his chin, saying “_Aku Kecik Joker Singapore_”, which means, “I am small Joker Singapore”.

26     While the acts of violence were being carried out, the trio were laughing as they found the victim’s snores to be funny. They left the isolated corner together at around 1.55am. Some of the above events were captured by various POLCAMs in the Block (the video was played in court).

#### Victim’s injuries

27     When the police arrived, a police officer tried to wake the victim up, but the latter was unresponsive. He was conveyed to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (“**TTSH**”) on 15 November 2020 at 9.53am.

28     In his report dated 19 January 2021, Dr Benjamin Huang, Resident Physician of the Department of Neurosurgery at the National Neuroscience Institute at TTSH, observed that following the victim’s admission to the A&E department, the victim was unconscious, abrasions were noted over his lips, and there was mild right cephalohematoma. The victim was noted to have a fever of 38 degrees Celsius, and his CT brain scan showed a falcine and right frontal subdural hematoma.

29     Further MRI scan of the victim’s brain revealed the following: acute infarct in the splenium of the corpus callosum, an acute lacunar infarct in the right periventricular white matter with the known acute bilateral frontal convexity subdural hematoma with extension along the falx, and scattered subarachnoid haemorrhages over the high frontal and parietal sulci with haemorrhagic contusions in the frontal lobes.

30     In his clarification report dated 11 March 2021, _Dr Huang concluded that the victim’s injuries were consistent with trauma and that the victim was unable to perform activities of daily living. This is likely to be permanent_. The victim’s diagnosis was that of a traumatic bifrontal subdural haematoma, and his neurological prognosis and potential for full recovery remains guarded.

31     In a further clarification report dated 24 August 2021, Dr Huang concluded that the victim’s CT scan showed a minimally displaced comminuted fracture of the nasal bone and vomer with surrounding soft tissue oedema and left sided septa deviation.

32     The victim was admitted at TTSH from 15 November 2020 to 7 January 2021 for the management of traumatic intracranial haemorrhage, being a total of 53 days. The total amount of medical costs incurred at TTSH was $14,064.45, which has not been paid to date.

33     The victim was transferred to Renci Community Hospital on 7 January 2021. _On 25 January 2021, he was transferred to Pacific Nursing Home for hospice care and has been residing there to-date_.

34      _To date, the victim is uncommunicative and is unable to perform daily basic functions and is unable to follow commands_. As at the date of his transfer, he still had left-sided hemiplegia. In a medical report dated 28 March 2022, Dr Sim Sze Lim stated that _the victim was not able to communicate relevantly at the time of examination and not able to follow simple instructions or carry out simple mathematics_. No compensation has been made to the victim to date.

### CDSA offence that occurred between 20 October and 30 October 2020

35     The Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme (“**SIRS**”) has the aim of helping Singaporean self-employed persons (“**SEP**”) who have less means and family support to tide over the period of extraordinary economic uncertainty. The National Trades Union Congress (“**NTUC**”) assisted the Ministry of Manpower (“**MOM**”) to manage the applications, and eligible SEPs could submit an online SIRS application via the NTUC portal with their Singpass. An eligible SEP would receive $9,000, paid out in three tranches.

36     The accused heard about the SIRS while he was in Prisons sometime in April 2020. Sometime in April 2020, the accused opened a POSB bank account (the “**Account**”). Sometime before 14 October 2020, the accused met one ‘Joey’ and agreed to provide this ‘Joey’ with his Singpass credentials and Account number in return for fast cash.

37     On 14 October 2020 at about 1.11pm, a SIRS application was submitted in the accused’s name via the NTUC portal. The application was approved and a total of $9,000 was disbursed into the Account; $6,000 was disbursed ($3,000 twice) on 20 October 2020, and $3,000 was disbursed on 28 October 2020 to the Account. The SIRS application contained false employment and income information, as well as a forged Lalamove payslip, purporting to show that accused earned a trade income of $3,683 between January 2020 and March 2020. In actual fact, the accused was not a SEP on or before 25 March 2020 as he was incarcerated in Prisons at the material time, nor was the accused working for Lalamove or earning the said declared income. The monies disbursed into his Account were therefore proceeds from criminal conduct, as NTUC was deceived by the false SIRS application and was dishonestly induced into delivering $9,000 into the accused’s Account.

38     Although the accused reasonably suspected the monies to be benefits from criminal conduct, he transferred $4,000 of the first tranche of $6,000 the following day to one Khew Boon Teck, purportedly to repay a loan from ‘Joey’. He then withdrew the remaining monies from the ATM and spent it on purchases of clothing apparel and alcoholic drinks. All in all, there were 16 occasions of use of the said $9,000:

> a.     Between 20 and 23 October 2020, the accused made 11 transfers/withdrawals totalling $6,041.72 from the Account, and had a balance of $99.76 in the Account.

> b.     On 28 to 30 October 2020, the accused made 5 transfers/withdrawals totalling $3,000, leaving a balance of $7.85 on 30 October 2020.

39     Accordingly, the accused has committed an offence under s 47AA(1) punishable under s 47AA(2) of the CDSA which taken together, amount to a course of conduct, which charge was amalgamated pursuant to s 124(4) and punishable under s 124(8) of the Criminal Procedure Code, Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed. (“**CPC**”).

### Remission Order under the Prisons Act

40     From 18 August 2020 to 5 March 2022, the accused was subject to a remission order made by the Commissioner of Prisons under Division 2 or 3 of Part VB of the Prisons Act (Cap. 247, 2014 Rev Ed) (“PA”) which remission order was subject to the basic condition under s 50S(1) of the PA.

41     While the order was in effect, the accused committed the abovementioned offences and was therefore deemed to have breached the basic condition of the remission order and was hence liable to be punished under s 50T(1)(a) of the PA, to imprisonment for a period not exceeding 476 days in relation to the rioting and VCH offences, and a period not exceeding 502 days in relation to the CDSA offence.

## Prescribed punishments and antecedents

42     In respect of the rioting charge (DAC 923116-2020), the offence is punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years, and also with caning. In light of the breach of the remission order reflected in the charge, the accused was further liable for an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of 476 days.

43     In respect of the VCH charge (DAC 915955-2021), the offence is punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 years, or a fine which may extend to $5,000, or both. In light of the breach of the remission order reflected in the charge, the accused was further liable for an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of 476 days.

44     In respect of the CDSA charge (DAC 901594-2022), for an individual, the offence is punishable with a fine not exceeding $150,000, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years, or both. Further, as this is an amalgamated charge, by virtue of s 124(8)(a)(ii) of the CPC, the court may sentence the accused to “2 times the amount the amount of punishment to which that person would otherwise have been liable if that person had been charged with and convicted of any one of the incidents of commission of the offence…” In addition, in light of the breach of the remission order reflected in the charge, the accused was further liable for an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of 502 days.

45     As far as the accused’s antecedents were concerned, he had a long list of previous convictions. These were for offences such as robbery, robbery with hurt, driving without a driving licence and also without the requisite motor insurance, drug possession and drug consumption, criminal intimidation, voluntarily causing hurt, and also two previous counts of rioting.

46     Details of his previous convictions for violence related offences, namely for offences of robbery with hurt, voluntarily causing hurt, and for rioting, all of which were particularly pertinent for the present case, are set out below:

48     Both the Prosecution and the Defence tendered lengthy submissions in support of their respective positions. At this stage, I will outline the main arguments put forward by parties, before dealing with them in a more comprehensive manner when giving my reasons for the sentences imposed.

## Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

### Rioting charge

49     For this charge, the Prosecution sought a sentence of 42 to 44 months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. In essence, the Prosecution highlighted several factors which I have categorised below as follows:

> a.     Role and culpability: The accused was more culpable than the three of his co-accused persons who have been dealt with, all of whom were also younger than him. Further, the accused was the co-mastermind of the plan with Salman to avenge ‘Mami’, and he played a serious role in the actual attack, and showed a lack of remorse afterwards.

> b.     Antecedents: The accused has two previous rioting convictions for which he had received sentences of 20 to 24 months’ imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane for each offence.

> c.     Nature of victim and the injuries caused: The victim was a vulnerable person of 60 years old. He suffered severe and permanent injuries as a result of the offence.

> d.     Nature and planning of attack: The attack was sudden, unprovoked and premeditated. The victim was also heavily outnumbered. In addition, the attack took place in the early morning, and in a public place that was also a residential area. The attack caused public disquiet and public alarm.

> e.     Case Precedents:

>> i.       The usual range of punishment for ‘non-secret society related’ rioting cases is 18 - 36 months’ imprisonment as well as caning from three to 12 strokes (see _Phua Song Hua v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGHC 33</span> (“**_Phua Song Hua_**”) at \[42\]). The sentence for the present case should go beyond the usual custodial range in light of the accused’s status as headman of Kallang Airport division of the Gang. He was therefore the leader of Danish, Zul and Effendi. Further, the maximum imprisonment term for an offence under s 147 of the Penal Code has increased from 5 years to 7 years since the time _Phua Song Hua_ was decided.

>> ii.       The case of _PP v Mohammad Azimmi bin Jamaluddin and others_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGDC 269</span> (“**_Mohammad Azimmi_**_”_) at \[27\] stated that the sentencing benchmark for an offender with similar antecedents who pleaded guilty to a s 147 PC charge, where no serious injuries are caused, is 36 months’ imprisonment. The present case was more serious than _Mohammad Azimmi_ because of the accused’s similar antecedents, _and_ the injuries caused to the victim were serious.

> f.     Other sentencing considerations

>> i.       Intoxication: The accused and his co-accused persons were intoxicated at the time of the offence.

>> ii.       While the accused pleaded guilty, this factor was mitigated by the fact that he was caught on CCTV camera surrounding the victim and being present during the attack. His plea of guilt was also not made at the first opportunity.

### VCH charge

50     For this charge, the Prosecution sought 24 to 28 months’ imprisonment, arguing that:

> a.     The harm caused was serious as the victim is in a vegetative state, and his injuries are permanent. It was fortuitous that he did not die.

> b.     In line with the framework for VCH cases set out in _PP v Low Song Chye_ \[2019\] 4 SLR 526 (“**_Low Song Chye_**”), and modified in _Fei Yi v PP_ (HC/MA 937/2022) (“**_Fei Yi_**”) to reflect the increase in the statutory maximum sentence from two to three years’ imprisonment since _Low Song Chye_, for cases of serious harm (Band 3), the indicative starting range for offences committed after 1 Jan 2020 is a range of 9 months and 36 months’ imprisonment.

> c.     In relation to culpability, the accused was not a first time offender for hurt-related offences. He also stuck at the victim’s face which was a vulnerable area. In addition, the victim was vulnerable by virtue of his age, and his unconscious state at the time of the offence.

> d.     In addition, this was a group attack on a defenceless victim, and the overall force used against the victim was high.

### CDSA charge

51     For this charge, the Prosecution sought a sentence of 2 to 4 months’ imprisonment. While this is the first s 47AA(2) CDSA charge preferred against an offender who defrauded the government in a SIRS application, the primary sentencing principle underpinning CDSA offences as a whole is deterrence.

52     The Prosecution also cited the Parliamentary Debates where, at the second reading of the Serious Crimes and Counter-Terrorism (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill, Second Minister for Home Affairs, Mrs Josephine Teo had, _inter alia_, highlighted the “…severe and even devastating consequences for Singapore” of money laundering and terrorism financing crimes, and the complex nature of money laundering operations of syndicates, which were factors in the introduction of the new section 47AA to the CDSA.”[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

53     The Prosecution argued that in respect of the present case:

> a.     The harm caused was moderate as a significant sum of $9,000 was involved. In addition, there was some evidence of a syndicate at work. Further, the predicate offence of cheating was clearly planned involving the provision of forged pay slips and the declaration of false incomes. Moreover, the accused withdrew the monies from his bank account, resulting in the successful dissipation of criminal proceeds. In addition, the monies involved were public funds, and could have been used to assist genuine applicants in need of money.

> b.     As for the accused’s culpability, this was moderate as he had allowed ‘Joey’ to use his account (which he specifically opened for the very purpose of benefitting from SIRS) to receive monies reasonably suspected to be criminal benefits. The accused had also personally gained $5,000 without making any restitution to the NTUC for the monies. Instead, he had spent the monies on frivolous purposes (including to purchase alcohol) and dissipated it.

54     Based on unreported cases involving offenders who had taken advantage of the COVID-19 support grant applications and fraudulent temporary relief fund applications involving offences of cheating or fraudulent documents, sentences ranging from 1 month to 3 months’ imprisonment have been imposed.

55     As for offences under s 47AA CDSA, as this provision only came into effect fairly recently on 1 April 2019, there were limited sentencing precedents. Nevertheless, the following sentences were imposed in two unreported cases where the money involved _were not government funds_.

> a.     5 months’ imprisonment was imposed in _PP v Chim Man Kit_ (SC-907842-2020) which involved $64,800; and

> b.     A total of 7 weeks’ imprisonment (4 weeks and 3 weeks consecutive imprisonment sentences involving sums of $8,900 and $5,000 respectively) was imposed in _PP v Kanda Amandeep Singh_ (SC-905138-2022).

56     The Prosecution argued that cases involving defrauding the Government warranted an uplift in sentence from these cases in \[55\]. Hence, a sentence of two to four months’ imprisonment was appropriate in the present case.

### Enhancement under s 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act

57     The Court in _Abdul Mutalib bin Aziman v PP and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 102</span> (“**_Abdul Mutalib”_**_)_ set out a sentencing band approach for a breach of remission orders under the PA as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="13.22%"><col width="33.96%"><col width="52.82%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Band</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Degree of severity</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentencing range (based on the remaining duration of the remission order)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Low</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Up to 1/3</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Moderate</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1/3 to 2/3</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">High</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2/3 to full remaining duration</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

58     The considerations to determine the appropriate sentencing band under s 50T of the PA are the gravity of the fresh offence, the rehabilitative prospects of the offender, and all other relevant circumstances (see s 50T(3) PA).

59     In the present case, the Prosecution sought the full remaining period of the remission order of 476 days for the most serious offence of rioting, but did not seek any further enhancement of sentence for the remaining offences. The Prosecution argued that the underlying rioting offence committed was grave on the facts, and it was also punishable by up to 7 years’ imprisonment. Further, the fresh rioting offence committed was not only similar, but was more serious than his previous offences of rioting. Moreover, he had committed the fresh offence just three months after he was released on 18 August 2020. Hence, the degree of severity was high such that the full remaining duration of the remaining period of the remission order in relation to the rioting charge should be added to the sentence.

### Global Sentence

60     The Prosecution argued that the sentences for all three offences should run consecutively, resulting in a global sentence of 68 to 76 months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for the principal offences, plus 476 days of imprisonment for the breach of the remission order.

61     In this regard, the Prosecution submitted that:

> a.     Although the rioting and VCH offences took place in the same transaction, the accused had committed further acts of abuse on the victim for the latter offence. Allowing the sentences to run concurrently would put the accused’s position in the same light as Effendi and Danish, even though these two persons who were implicated for rioting, were not involved in the later VCH offence, and hence had not committed further acts of violence against the victim after the initial rioting.

> b.     Further, the two offences protect different legal interests as rioting is an offence against public order, and the gravamen of the offence is the weight of numbers against a victim. In contrast, the VCH offence is an offence against the person/body, the essence of which is the causing of hurt to the body.

> c.     Further, when the co-accused, Zul, pleaded guilty earlier, his imprisonment sentences for rioting and for VCH ran consecutively.

> d.     As for the CDSA offence, the sentence should also run consecutively as it involved a different protected legal interest and was not part of the same transaction.

62     The Prosecution also submitted that the aggregate sentence that it sought does not breach the totality principle as it was not substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences (being that of rioting), and does not have a crushing effect on the accused. It was also in keeping with the accused’s past records. Finally, the proposed sentence was in line with the principle of deterrence, which is the dominant sentencing consideration for offences affecting public safety and order.

## Mitigation Plea

63     The Defence sought a global sentence of no more than 24 months’ imprisonment and no more than five strokes of the cane, a fine of S$6,000 (in default two weeks’ imprisonment) for the three principal offences, as well as an additional enhanced sentence of not more than 10 months’ imprisonment for the breach of the remission order under s 50T of the PA. The proposed breakdown of the Defence’s proposed global sentence was as follows:

> a.     An imprisonment term of no more than 24 months and no more than five strokes of the cane for the rioting charge;

> b.     an imprisonment term of not more than four weeks for the VCH charge, which was to run concurrently with the rioting charge;

> c.     a fine of S$6,000 (in default two weeks’ imprisonment) for the CDSA charge; and

> d.     an enhanced imprisonment sentence not exceeding 10 months, pursuant to section 50T of the PA.

64     As regard general mitigating considerations, the Defence emphasised that the accused had pleaded guilty, and that during the past one year and ten months that he was in remand, he has had the opportunity to reflect on his mistakes. Upon his release from prison, he hopes to complete his diploma in culinary arts and to find a job in the food and beverage industry to support his family. For the sake of his family, he has vowed to turn over a new leaf.

65     I summarise below the main arguments put forward by the Defence.

### Rioting and VCH charges

66     As regards these two offences, the Defence highlighted that they arose from a personal conflict between the victim and some of the attendees of that gathering, and that the victim was attacked twice at the void deck of Block 9 North Bridge Road. On both occasions, the accused did not initiate the altercation with the victim, nor was he the primary attacker.

67     Specifically, as regards the rioting charge, the Defence submitted that the following factors justified an imprisonment term not exceeding 24 months and five strokes of the cane:

> a.     The principle of parity in sentencing operated, bearing in mind that his relative responsibility was, as argued by the Defence, lower than that of his co-accused persons. In this regard, the Defence submitted that the co-accused person, Danish, was an active participant in the rioting, and he was sentenced to only 24 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of cane. The other co-accused, Effendi, who was a passive participant, was sentenced to 19 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of cane. As the accused’s participation in the rioting was limited (although not completely passive), the Defence argued that his sentence should fall in between the sentences meted out to Danish and Effendi.

> b.     The Defence also argued that the accused’s early plea of guilt should result in a sentencing discount.

68     As for the VCH charge, the Defence argued that a sentence of not more than four weeks’ imprisonment was appropriate in light of the following:

> a.     The Defence accepted that the injuries caused to the victim were serious and the victim’s neurological prognosis and potential for full recovery remains guarded. This placed the offence in Band 3 of the sentencing bands set out in _Low Song Chye_ (with the range of sentence being six to 24 months’ imprisonment). Nevertheless, the Defence argued that the sentence imposed here should be lighter because of the accused’s comparative lack of culpability, citing the case of _Koh Jing Kwang v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 1 SLR 7</span>. There, the offender had thrown a single punch to the victim that led to the victim stumbling back and hitting his head, resulting in a skull fracture. Given the severity of the victim’s injury there, the case would ordinarily have fallen within the sentencing range of 6 months to 24 months’ imprisonment for Band 3 offences, but the court imposed a sentence of 12 weeks’ imprisonment because the accused could not be held to account for the full extent of the consequences suffered by the victim. The Defence argued that the victim’s serious injuries were more likely to have been caused by the co-accused persons’ acts, instead of that of the accused, which were limited to a single backhanded slap and a single blow from the accused’s elbow to the victim’s chin.

> b.     Further, in _Public Prosecutor v Prevan Prakash s/o Panirselvam_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGMC 35</span>, where the offender had joined two co-offenders in hitting and punching the victim, but where the accused had left after 20 seconds while the co-offenders had continued to injure the victim, the offender there was sentenced to four weeks’ imprisonment. In the present case, the Defence argued that, the accused’s role and the harm that he caused as an individual were limited both in time, and in severity, as compared to his co-accused persons. Hence, his culpability was similar to the culpability of the offender in _Prevan Prakash_, and the four weeks’ imprisonment sentence imposed in _Prevan Prakash_ was an appropriate sentencing benchmark to apply.

69     In addition, the Defence argued that the sentences for the rioting and VCH charges should run concurrently as the offences were committed in the course of a single transaction, as they involved the same accused (and co-accused persons) and the same victim, they had occurred during the same broad time period and at the same place, and also involved the protection of the same legal interest i.e. the protection against bodily harm.

### CDSA charge

70     The Defence argued for a fine of $6,000 for this charge submitting that the accused had committed the offence because of his misplaced trust in his friend “Joey”, whom he had approached as he was desperate for cash after his release from prison in August 2020.

71     The Defence also argued that as there were no sentencing precedents for charges pertaining to section 47AA of the CDSA, the case of _Abdul Ghani bin Tahir v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 1153</span>, which involved offences under section 47(1)(b) of the CDSA (being an offence in relation to the acquisition, possession, use, concealment or transfer of benefits from criminal conduct) was instructive. In that case, Chan Seng Onn J had sentenced the offender to a fine of S$10,000 (in default two weeks’ imprisonment) for each of the first two charges relating to the transfer of US$48,100 in total. Justice Chan also noted that the accused’s culpability increased from the 4th charge onwards, and thus imposed custodial sentences for the subsequent charges.

72     The Defence argued that as the accused’s charge under s 47AA(1) of the CDSA was less serious than a charge under s 47(1)(c) of the CDSA, given that the lower prescribed punishments for the s 47AA(1) offence, and as the total amount transferred by the accused amounted to S$9,000, which was significantly less than the total amount transferred for the first two charges in _Abdul Ghani_, a fine of S$6,000 (in default two weeks’ imprisonment) was sufficient in the present case.

### Enhancement under s 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act

73     As the accused was subject to a remission order between 18 August 2020 and 5 March 2022, an enhanced sentence of up to 502 days may be imposed, pursuant to s 50T of the PA in relation to the CDSA charge. The Defence submitted that any enhanced sentence should not exceed ten months in light of the following:

> a.     Any enhanced sentence imposed should ordinarily not exceed the underlying sentence imposed for the fresh offence as the court was ultimately punishing the offender for the fresh offence, and not for the original offence.

> b.     The appropriate sentencing band for the enhanced sentence under section 50T of the Prisons Act ought to be Band 2 as set out in _Abdul Mutalib_ (at \[87(b)\]). This attracts sentences of between one-third and two-thirds of the remaining duration of the remission order at the time of the relevant offence. This sentencing band takes into account the severity of the offences, his accused’s antecedents for rioting and VCH, and his lower culpability relative to the co-accused persons.

> c.     Applying the appropriate sentencing range for Band 2, the accused’s enhanced sentence should not exceed two-thirds of 502 days, which roughly translates to a maximum of 11 months’ imprisonment. Thereafter, given the accused’s lower relative culpability for the rioting and VCH charges, and his commitment not to re-offend, the accused’s enhanced sentence should be reduced to not more than 10 months’ imprisonment.

### Global Sentence

74     The Defence thus sought a global imprisonment sentence of no more than 24 months, and also no more than five strokes of the cane for the rioting and VCH charges, a fine of S$6,000 (in default two weeks’ imprisonment) for the CDSA charge, and an enhanced imprisonment sentence not exceeding 10 months, pursuant to section 50T of the PA.

## Decision on Sentence

75     As regards the three charges that he was convicted on, these consisted of two charges involving violence, and one charge involving the use of tainted property. I will deal first with the two violence related offences, namely the rioting and VCH offences, before setting out my views and decision on the CDSA offence. I will then consider the effect of enhanced punishment under the PA, and finally the global sentence.

### Rioting Offence

#### Sentencing range and maximum prescribed punishment

76     As regards rioting offences under s 147 of the Penal Code, in _Phua Song Hua_, Yong Pung How CJ (as he then was) noted at \[42\] that as regards “non-secret society related” offences:

> **_The courts have consistently imposed 18 to 36 months’ imprisonment, as well as caning ranging from three to 12 strokes_** _: Chua Hwee Kiat Louis v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] SGDC 220</span>, _Yim Kar Mun Stanley v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] SGDC 1</span>, _Osman bin Ramli v PP (\[35\] supra), Rajasekaran s/o Armuthelingam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] SGHC 275</span> and _Tan Li Hui v PP_ \[1999\] SGDC.

\[emphasis added\]

77     It should be noted that _Phua Song Hua_ was a 2004 decision and that the sentencing range for rioting offences that Yong CJ referred to, pertained to cases decided prior to 1 February 2008. As noted by Yong CJ in _Phua Song Hua_ at \[39\], the maximum prescribed imprisonment for a s 147 offence at that time was only 5 years’ imprisonment (see \[39\] of _Phua Song Hua_). The maximum prescribed imprisonment term for a s 147 offence has since been increased from 5 years to 7 years for offences committed on or after 1 February 2008. It was this higher maximum prescribed punishment of 7 years’ imprisonment that applied to the accused’s rioting offence in the present case.

78     It should also be noted that Sundaresh Menon CJ made the observation in _Poh Boon Kiat v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 892</span> at \[60\] that the statutory maximum sentence signals the gravity with which Parliament views any individual offence. Thus, it would appear that the increase in the prescribed punishment for rioting offences, reflects the legislature’s desire for harsher punishments to be imposed on such offenders.

79     Accordingly, I accepted the Prosecution’s argument that the sentencing range for rioting offences should be higher than the then norm of “18 to 36 months’ imprisonment” for non-secret society cases recognised in _Phua Song Hua_. This would reflect the harsher attitude that Parliament has since expressed towards perpetrators of such offences.

80     Such an approach of factoring in the increase in maximum prescribed punishment in determining sentence, would also be in line with the guidance of the Court of Appeal in _Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 653</span>, where the Court had made it clear at \[84\] that “…sentencing judges must take note of the maximum penalty and then apply their minds to determine precisely where the offender’s conduct falls within the spectrum of punishment devised by Parliament.”

81     In line with the above guidance from the Courts, I was of the view that the sentencing ranges for rioting offences involving non-secret society cases, should be adjusted proportionately to approximate 25 to 50 months’ imprisonment, instead of the earlier 18 to 36 months’ imprisonment range referred to in _Phua Song Hua_.

82     In the present case, the Prosecution had sought a sentence of 42 to 44 months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for the accused’s rioting offence, highlighting a myriad of factors, including the accused’s role, his antecedents, the vulnerable nature of the victim and the injuries that had been caused to him, the circumstances of the attack, the planning involved, the place where the offence occurred, and the state of intoxication of the rioters including of the accused (see \[49\] above). In contrast, the Defence had sought a sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment and not more than five strokes of the cane, primarily based on parity, and the accused’s plea of guilt.

83     Having considered the facts as a whole, as well as the relevant case law including the guidance set out in _Phua Song Hua_, and the increase in the maximum punishment for rioting offences since then, it was clear to me that a sufficiently lengthy term of imprisonment, more in line with what the Prosecution had sought, was correct in law, consistent with sentencing principles and factors, and appropriate on the facts. I elaborate below.

#### Nature of the offence and injury suffered by the victim

84     First, as regards the nature of the offence and the harm caused, the accused was charged for a group offence involving cruel and senseless violence directed against the then 60-year old victim. As noted by Yong CJ In _Phua Song Hua_ at \[39\], “the gravamen of the offence of rioting is the pursuit of the common unlawful purpose through weight of numbers. **The individual is thus not being sentenced for his individual acts considered in isolation, but for his participation in the collective offence of rioting**” (emphasis added)

85     This consideration of the collective nature of such offences, was also recognised in _Public Prosecutor v Nirmal Singh_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 293</span>, a district court decision that was affirmed on appeal. In _Nirmal Singh_, the court noted at \[27\] that “…in such cases of mob violence, rather than just look at the act of any one individual of the group, one should consider the collective effect and violence of the group as a whole. If nothing else, each member of the group could, through his own participation and involvement, have emboldened and spurred on the rest of the group, significantly magnifying the damage that could have been caused.”

86     In the present case, the “collective offence of rioting” (as per Yong CJ in _Phua Song Hua_) had, together with the offence of VCH also involving the accused, caused the victim to suffer permanent, horrendous and life-changing injuries (see also \[97\] and \[98\] below). Specifically, the victim has since been diagnosed with _inter alia_, traumatic brain haemorrhage, and a nasal and a vomer fracture. The victim is also unable to perform activities of daily living, and his potential for full recovery remains guarded, i.e. he is unlikely to recover from the injuries. As noted in the SOF, the victim was hospitalised for a lengthy period of 53 days and has been resident in a hospice facility for more than two years since 25 January 2021. Further, consistent with the Prosecution’s submissions at \[4\] of the \`Prosecution’s Address On Sentence’ (PAOS), it was purely fortuitous that the victim had survived the heinous and brutal attacks by the accused and his co-accused persons directed at him.

#### Culpability of the accused, antecedents and the issue of parity

87     I have highlighted Yong CJ’s words _in Phua Song Hua_ at \[39\] that as regards the offence of rioting, the offender “(t)he individual is thus not being sentenced for his individual acts considered in isolation, but for his participation in the collective offence of rioting”. However, Yong CJ had also made clear at \[40\] of the same case that “(t)he principle does not imply that the role of the accused, relative to the other offenders, can never be taken into account”.

88     In this respect, and as regards the parity principle, I noted that three of the co-accused persons had pleaded guilty much earlier to their rioting charges. The circumstances of these offenders, and the sentences that they received, were set out in the table at \[8\] of the PAOS, which I have again reproduced below for easy reference:

89     In so far as culpability of the accused was concerned, and the related issue of parity of sentencing, I agreed that the accused was clearly more culpable than the co-accused persons already sentenced. Hence, his sentence should be correspondingly higher. Added to this was the accused’s two previous similar antecedents for rioting, and hence the operation of the principle of escalation which called for a sentence higher than what was previously imposed. I elaborate below.

> a.     As stated in the SOF, the accused was the headman of the Kallang Airport division of the Gang. He was thus the leader of Danish, Zul and Effendi. Added to this was the fact that the accused, at 34 years old, was about ten years older than Danish, Zul and Effendi. They clearly would have looked to him as a leader in the assault on the victim.

> b.     Further, in contrast to these three younger members of his gang (who had already pleaded guilty), the accused was also intricately involved in the acts leading up to the assault. In this regard, he was in direct contact with the victim prior to the confrontation, and had even instructed Zolkiple to bring up any of the victim’s friends who may arrive with him. Clearly, he was a lot more involved than the younger co-accused persons who principally just participated in the actual attack.

> c.     During the assault on the victim, the accused had also sat on the victim’s stomach and had swung his right fist at the victim’s left cheek twice while the victim was already unconscious. In assessing his role, regard had further to be made not only to the fact that his blows were directed at the face which was a vulnerable part of the victim’s body, but also that this was done when the victim was lying down, unconscious and also pinned down by the accused sitting on his stomach, while being attacked by the accused and the co-accused persons.

> d.     After inflicting violence on the victim, and with the latter still lying motionless and bleeding from his face, the accused and his co-accused persons had left the victim at the void deck. Thereafter, as highlighted by the Prosecution, and as set out in the SOF, there was evidence that the accused (but apparently not the co-accused persons) apparently felt that he had exacted revenge for ‘Mami’ when he said to Hamidah “Demi Mami”, **_three times_**, meaning “For Mami”. Clearly, these acts demonstrated defiance and vindictiveness, and a sorry lack of remorse or contrition on the part of the accused.

> e.     In short, in assessing their respective roles, the accused was clearly more culpable than the co-accused persons already dealt with.

90     Aside from the issue of relative culpabilities, there were other reasons why the accused’s sentence should be higher than that of his co-accused persons. This meant that the sentence that he should receive should exceed even the 34 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane imposed on Zul.

> a.     For one, the accused has a much more serious history of previous similar convictions than his co-accused persons. In this regard, neither Danish nor Effendi have related antecedents, while Zul had one less serious antecedent of unlawful assembly, for which he was sentenced to 11 weeks’ imprisonment. In contrast, the accused has two serious antecedents of rioting for which he had received far higher sentences of 20 to 24 months’ imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane each. His previous rioting convictions and sentences were also relative recent, being received in 2014 and 2017.

> b.     The accused also pleaded guilty only on 15 September 2022, while Zul, Effendi and Danish had all pleaded guilty earlier, on 24 June 2022, 1 March 2022 and 28 October 2021 respectively. As highlighted by the Prosecution[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2), the accused’s plea of guilt was also not made at the first opportunity.

#### Other aggravating features

91     There were also other aggravating features that featured prominently in the present case.

> a.     The victim was a vulnerable person of 60 years old at the time of the offence. When the group began their collective assault on him, the victim was also unconscious (having been struck by Danish at the onset), and hence was totally defenceless against the accused and the other co-accused persons. The rioters thus kicked and punched him at will.

> b.     The attack was sudden and unprovoked, albeit with a significant degree of planning and premeditated. This was especially in the case of the accused who had instructed Zolkiple (before the attack) to go down the staircase and bring up any of the victim’s friends who may have accompanied him.

> c.     The assault also took place in the early morning at about 1.43 am, and in a public place which was a residential area. In the circumstances, the riot could have caused grave public alarm and chaos, and there was additionally a real danger posed to innocent bystanders who may be caught up in the violence. As made clear by Chao Hick Tin JA in _PP v Ong Chee Heng_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 876</span> at \[45\] “…the fact that an offence – particularly a violence-related offence – is committed in a public place will be an aggravating factor if it causes public fear and alarm… I would also add that the fact that an offender chooses to commit the offence in a public place is a factor that may enhance his culpability in so far as it demonstrates the brazenness of his conduct and his blatant disregard for law and order.”

> d.     The accused person had consumed alcohol and was intoxicated at the time of the attack. As noted by VK Rajah JA at \[44\] of _Wong Hoi Len v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 1 SLR(R) 115</span>, “No intoxicated individual must be given the licence to roam public streets at night spoiling for trouble and/or behave in a disorderly and loutish manner… a sentencing judge should ordinarily take into account an offender’s intoxication as an aggravating consideration. **Those who voluntarily imbibe alcohol must, in the usual course of events, take full responsibility for their subsequent offending.**” (emphasis added)

92     In short, for all the reasons set out above, including the sentencing range identified _Phua Song Hua_ (which was actually for rioting with “non-secret society” elements) as revised by the increase in the maximum prescribed punishment for rioting since then (see discussion at \[76\] to \[80\] above), and noting that Faizal was actually the leader of a division of the Gang and that the persons who assaulted the victim were all members of that Gang, I was of the view that, on a _preliminary basis_, the sentence of 42 months’ imprisonment, which was at the lower end of the range sought by the Prosecution for the accused’s rioting offence, was entirely appropriate. In contrast, and with respect, the sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment proposed by the Defence was completely unrealistic and manifestly inadequate.

93     I was also of the view that in light of the nature and extent of violence involved, and the serious injuries that was caused to the victim, caning of 6 strokes of the cane, which was within the normal range of sentences highlighted in _Phua Song Hua_, should additionally be imposed.

### VCH offence

94     In _Low Song Chye_, the High Court set out the sentencing framework for VCH offences under s 323 of the Penal Code. In the recent decision of _Fei Yi_, the district judge modified the _Low Song Chye_ framework for VCH offences post 1-January 2020, in order to reflect the increase in maximum sentence from two to three years’ imprisonment since the decision in _Low Song Chye._ This was done by adjusting the indicative sentencing ranges arithmetically to utilise the entire sentencing range of up to three years’ imprisonment (see \[75\] of _Fei Yi_) to arrive at the following:.

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="11.32%"><col width="47.16%"><col width="41.52%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Band</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Hurt caused</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Indicative sentencing range for offences after 1 Jan 2020 (Low Song Chye x 1.5)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Low harm:</b> no visible injury or minor hurt such as bruises, scratches, minor lacerations or abrasions</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fines or custodial term up to 6 weeks</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Moderate harm:</b> hurt resulting in short hospitalisation or a substantial period of medical leave, simple fractures, or temporary or mild loss of a sensory function</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Between 6 weeks and 9 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Serious harm:</b> serious injuries which are permanent in nature and/or which necessitate significant surgical procedures</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Between 9 months and 36 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

95     An appeal against conviction and sentence of the district court in _Fei Yi_ was dismissed by the High Court in HC/MA 937/2022. This result lent strong support to the Prosecution’s argument that the modified framework in \[94\] above was endorsed by the High Court, and thus should apply to all VCH offences post 1st January 2020.

96     In the present case, both the Prosecution and the Defence accepted that the harm caused to the victim was serious. As noted above, the victim has suffered permanent injuries, is in a vegetative state, and has in fact been resident in a hospice facility for over two years since 25 January 2021. It follows then that this was a Band 3 case, with an indicative sentencing range of 9 to 36 months’ imprisonment.

97     Thereafter, in deciding the appropriate starting point within this indicative sentencing range, I was aware that the victim’s injuries, while severe, horrendous, and likely permanent, were also the culmination of both the offences of rioting and VCH, rather than just the result of any one of these offences alone. Further, while the VCH offences would likely have aggravated the injuries caused as a result of the earlier rioting offence, in fairness to the accused, I could not attribute the full extent of the injuries suffered by the victim to only the later VCH offence alone.

98     Thus, in assessing the harm caused and addressing the concerns highlighted above, I was of the view that I should take a holistic, practical, and common-sensical approach as regards the injuries caused to the victim as a whole. This, I did, on an overall basis, by _starting off_ with a relatively low sentence for the later VCH offence, that I pegged at no higher than a sentence around the middle of the indicative sentencing range of 9 to 36 months’ imprisonment i.e. _starting off_ by considering imprisonment of no more than 22 months for this offence.

99     Moving on to the issue of the culpability of the accused, I agreed with the Prosecution that this was high:

> a.     For one, it appeared that the accused, together with his co-accused persons, had taken the opportunity to inflict further injury on the victim when the latter was already literally down and out, having been struck unconscious and bleeding from his face at that time. In those circumstances, the accused took advantage of the fact that Zul had moved the unconscious victim to the isolated corner of the void deck away from POLCAMs, before deciding to assault the victim further.

> b.     In the case of the accused, he had sat on the victim’s stomach and gave him a backhanded slap, and then used his right elbow to strike the victim once at his chin. He even said the words “_Aku Kecik Joker Singapore_”, which means, “I am small Joker Singapore”, and laughed with the other two co-accused persons while the acts of violence were being inflicted. It should be noted that for this VCH offence, the accused had directed his elbow at the victim’s face which was not only a vulnerable part of the victim’s body, but which was also the same area of the victim’s body that the accused had previously attacked during the earlier rioting offence. By then, the victim’s face was already bloodied. The accused was also present all the way to the end of the assault.

> c.     Nevertheless, in assessing the victim’s role, I recognised that as far as the VCH charge was concerned, the accused could be said to be less culpable than Zul, as it was the latter who had decided to drag the victim to the isolated spot before Zul, Salman and the accused assaulted the victim in the manner set out in the VCH charge. The acts of the Zul in punching the victim in the face, and kicking him, were also more vicious than that of the accused who had sat on the victim, given him a slap, and had struck the latter in his face with his elbow.

> d.     However, it should be noted that there were also aggravating factors that applied to the accused that did not apply to Zul. For one, unlike Zul who has no previous hurt-related convictions, the accused has a wretched history of violence, having been previously convicted of an offence of robbery with hurt in 2009, and a separate offence of voluntarily causing hurt in 2014. The accused was also older than Zul, and he was the headman of the Kallang Airport division of the Gang of which Zul was a member. As stated above, it could thus be expected that Zul would have looked to the accused and followed his lead.

100    On balance, it would appear that in line with the modified _Low Song Chye_ sentencing range, the principle of parity, and the other sentencing considerations highlighted above, on a _preliminary basis_, the accused should receive a sentence of about 20 months’ imprisonment for the VCH offence.

### CDSA offence

101    I agreed with the Prosecution that the primary sentencing principle underpinning CDSA offences is deterrence, and that money laundering operations involving syndicates in particular have to be severely dealt with. In the context of the present offence, the role and culpability of the accused, and the presence of various aggravating factors, all pointed to the need to impose a sentence that was sufficiently punitive, albeit proportionate to the circumstances of the offence. The sentencing considerations that applied are set out below

> a.     The nature of the funds and harm caused:

>> i.       The monies that the accused used were derived from SIRS. This meant that they were meant for self-employed persons with less means and family support, and whose livelihoods had been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As set out in the SOF, these sums were public funds administered by MOM, which dealt with the applications and appeals for SIRS, assisted in this process by the NTUC. Clearly, offenders who target public monies, especially monies intended for those in genuine need because of a health emergency and national crisis, must be severely dealt with.

>> ii.       It should also be noted that in this particular case, the amount of money involved at $9,000, was also significantly large.

>> iii.       The money was dissipated by the accused, through having $4,000 transferred purportedly to repay ‘Joey’s’ loan, and the remaining $5,000 being withdrawn by the accused and spent on frivolous purposes (including to purchase alcohol). This was particularly grating when one considers that this squandering of the funds, deprived genuine and deserving applicants of the equivalent amount of needed financial assistance.

>> iv.       All in all, I agreed with the Prosecution that the harm caused in this case was moderate.

> b.     Culpability of the accused:

>> i.       As highlighted in the SOF, the accused had heard about the SIRS when that he was in Prison. He then opened the Account a few months after. Subsequently, the accused provided his Singpass credentials and Account number to ‘Joey’ and a SIRS application was thereafter generated in his name. This led to $9,000 being disbursed to the Account, and subsequently used by the accused in the manner set out in the SOF. The role of the accused in opening the Account, in allowing it to be used to receive the suspected criminal proceeds, and in using the $4,000 in the manner for \`Joey’s’ benefit, and the remaining for his own frivolous purposes, showed a moderate level of culpability.

>> ii.       No restitution was made by the accused.

>> iii.       The use of false document and information provided for the purposes of the SIRS application suggested the entire operation was well planned, sophisticated and likely syndicated.

> c.     Precedents: The unreported cases cited by the Prosecution showed that sentences of 1 month to 3 months’ imprisonment have been imposed on offenders who had taken advantage of similar COVID-19 support grant applications, as well as made fraudulent temporary relief fund applications. As for s 47AA CDSA offences, the two unreported decisions cited by the Prosecution also showed that sentences of 3 weeks, 4 weeks, and 5 months have been imposed where the sums involved were $5,000, $8,900 and $64,800 respectively. For completeness, I did not find the precedent cited by the Defence to be of relevance, as it dealt with a different provision.

102    Thus, taking into account the sentencing factors and precedents cited above, I was of the view that a custodial sentence was clearly called for in the present case. As for the length of this sentence, taking into account the accused’s circumstances, and also bearing in mind that this was an amalgamated charge, I was of the view that a term of 2 months’ imprisonment, which was at the lower end of the sentencing range suggested by the Prosecution, was appropriate.

### Enhancement under s 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act

103    The High Court in _Abdul Mutalib_ laid out a sentencing band approach for a breach of remission order under the PA. I have set out below the main aspects of the _Abdul Mutalib_ approach, as it applies to the present case:

> (a)     First, the court should consider the gravity of the fresh offence committed by the offender while on remission, the offender’s rehabilitative prospects and “all other relevant circumstances”:

>> (i)       In general, the more severe the fresh offence committed by the offender and the greater the harm caused, the longer the enhanced sentence under s 50T will be.

>> (ii)       In assessing the offender’s rehabilitative prospects, the court should consider the totality of the circumstances, including the statutory factors under ss 50T(3) i.e. the similarity between the original offence and the fresh offence, the timing of the fresh offence relative to the date of the offender’s release from prison on remission, and any evidence of a lack of commitment to rehabilitation and reintegration on the offender’s part.

>> (iii)       As for considering all other relevant circumstances, this is a residual catch-all category which informs the court’s overall sentencing analysis, although care should be taken to avoid double-counting any factors.

> (b)     Next, based on the above factors, the court should determine which sentencing band the case falls under. There are three sentencing bands:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="16.84%"><col width="31.94%"><col width="51.22%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Band</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Degree of severity</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentencing range (based on the remaining duration of the remission order)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Low</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Up to 1/3</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Moderate</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1/3 to 2/3</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">High</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2/3 to full remaining duration</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

> (c)     Where multiple fresh offences are involved, the court should take note of the following:

>> (i)       The cumulative sentence imposed must not exceed the remaining duration of the remission order at the time of the offender’s earliest offence.

>> (ii)       Where the court is concerned purely with enhanced sentences under s 50T for fresh offences, it should, as a practical matter, determine the appropriate enhanced sentence to impose (if any) in order of the most serious to the least serious of the fresh offences, stopping once the whole of the remaining duration of the remission order at the time of the offender’s earliest offence has been rescinded.

> (d)     Finally, the court should take a “last look” at all the facts and circumstances of the case at hand to determine whether the aggregate sentence is crushing and not in keeping with the offender’s past record and future prospects.

104    In the present case, the Prosecution sought only an enhanced sentence for the rioting offence, albeit for the full remaining duration of the remaining period of the remission order of 476 days, arguing that this was a Band 3 offence, and that factors set out in _Abdul Mutalib_ pointed to the full period of 476 days being appropriate. The Defence sought an enhanced sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment (or about 304 days) arguing that this was a Band 2 case, and that the accused had a “lower relative culpability” for his rioting and VCH charge, and had also committed to not reoffending in the future.

105    I agreed with the approach proposed by the Prosecution as well as its submission on the enhanced sentence to impose. In this regard, applying the approach summarised at \[87\] of _Abdul Mutalib_, I determined the sentence to impose under s 50T(1)(a) of the PA in the manner set out below.

106    First, as regards the offence of rioting,

> a.     It was clear that rioting was the most serious of the fresh offences that the accused had been convicted of before me. The maximum imprisonment term for rioting is 7 years, and based on the decision in _Phua Song Hua_, caning of 3 to twelve strokes appear to be the norm. Further, for the reasons set out above, I had assessed that the circumstances of the rioting offence was such that on a _preliminary basis_, the sentence of 42 months’ imprisonment, and six strokes of the cane, within the range sought by the Prosecution, to be appropriate.

> b.     The fresh offence of rioting was also similar to his previous antecedents. In fact, as highlighted by the Prosecution, the fresh offence of rioting was even more serious that his previous offences of rioting.

> c.     Further, for the fresh rioting offence, the accused had committed this offence just three months after his release on 18 August 2020.

> d.     Accordingly, I assessed that the degree of severity was high such that this offence fell within Band 3 of the sentencing range. All things considered, and bearing in mind the recalcitrant nature of the accused’s offences of violence, I agreed with the approach of the Prosecution to impose the full remaining duration of the remaining period of the remission order of 476 days’ imprisonment.

107    Second, as regards the offence of VCH, this occurred on the same date as the rioting offence. As I had already imposed the full remaining duration of the remaining period of the remission order of 476 days’ imprisonment in relation to the rioting offence, there was no scope to impose any additional enhanced sentence in relation to the VCH offence.

108    Third, as for the CDSA offence, which preceded both the two offences of violence, the nature of this offence was very different from the previous antecedents of the accused. This offence was also comparative less serious than the two offences of violence directed against the victim, and its degree of severity could be considered as low. Further, in light of the enhanced sentence of 476 days’ imprisonment already imposed on the accused in connection with the rioting offence, and bearing in mind the need for proportionality and to avoid a crushing sentence, I was of the view that there was no need to impose any additional enhanced term of imprisonment in connection with the CDSA offence.

109    All in all, I impose an enhanced sentence of 476 days’ imprisonment only in connection with the rioting offence committed by the accused.

### Global Sentence

#### Analytical framework for sentencing a multiple offender

110    In _PP v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 148</span> (“**_Raveen Balakrishnan_**”), Menon CJ had set out an analytical framework for sentencing a multiple offender i.e. an offender who is to be sentenced for convictions on multiple offences. I set out the relevant extracts from \[98\] of the judgment:

> 98    In summary, the relevant principles in sentencing a multiple offender are as follows:

>> (a)    The first stage of the sentencing analysis is for the sentencing court to consider the appropriate sentence for each offence….In arriving at the individual sentences, the sentencing court will generally have to consider the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors that bear upon each discrete sentence (see \[37\] above).

>> (b)    The second stage of the sentencing analysis is to determine how the individual sentences should run. In this regard, the starting point of the analysis is whether the offences are unrelated and this is determined by considering whether they involve a single invasion of the same legally protected interest (see \[68\]–\[70\] above). As a general rule, sentences for unrelated offences should run consecutively, while sentences for offences that form part of a single transaction should run concurrently, subject to the requirement in s 307(1) of the CPC. If there is a mix of related and unrelated offences, the sentences for those offences that are unrelated should generally run consecutively with one of the sentences for the related offences (see \[53\]–\[55\] above). This general rule may be departed from so long as the sentencing court applies its mind to consider whether this is appropriate and explains its reasons for doing so. Statutory provisions may also abridge the operation of the general rule (see \[64\]–\[67\] above).

>> (c)    The third stage of the sentencing analysis is to apply the totality principle and take a “last look” at all the facts and circumstances to ensure that the aggregate sentence is sufficient and proportionate to the offender’s overall criminality (see \[73\] above). Specifically, there are two limbs to the totality principle. First, the court should examine whether the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed. Second, the court should examine whether the effect of the sentence on the offender is crushing and not in keeping with his past record and future prospects….

>> (d)    Across all stages of the analysis, the sentencing court should be careful not to offend the rule against double counting….It applies to both aggravating and mitigating factors, and it may arise in cases involving single offences as it does in cases involving multiple offending. However, it does not necessarily violate the rule against double counting if a fact constituting a mitigating factor is again taken into account in the application of the totality principle even though it has been given effect to elsewhere in the sentencing analysis (see \[91\]–\[94\] above).

111    In the present case, I had already considered the first step of the sentencing analysis in deciding on the preliminary sentence to be imposed in respect of the individual offences, including the appropriate enhancement in sentence arising from the accused’s breach of his remission order under the PA. I will now consider the second and third step of the sentencing analysis, _viz_, how the individual sentences should run, followed by the application of the totality principle.

#### How the sentences should run and the one-transaction rule

112    In relation to the second stage of the sentencing analysis, namely, determining how the individual sentences should run, the starting point was to decide whether the offences were unrelated, and this was determined by considering whether they involved a single invasion of the same legally protected interest. As noted in _Raveen Balakrishnan_ at \[98(b)\], “(a)s a general rule, sentences for unrelated offences should run consecutively, while sentences for offences that form part of a single transaction should run concurrently, subject to the requirement in s 307(1) of the CPC.”

113    The general practice of ordering concurrent sentences for offences that form part of a single transaction is essentially an application of the one-transaction rule see _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> (“**_Shouffee_**_”)_ at \[27\]). In _Shouffee_, Menon CJ had explained this rule as follows:

> \[32\]  The one-transaction rule is an _evaluative_ rule that is directed towards the ultimate enquiry that a sentencing court is engaged in: whether an offender should be doubly punished for offences that have been committed simultaneously or close together in time.

> \[40\]  While it may well be helpful to have regard to such factors as proximity in time, proximity of purpose, proximity of location of the offences, continuity of design and unity (or diversity) of the protected interests, in the final analysis, the consideration must be undertaken as a matter of common sense.

114    In addition at \[41\], Menon CJ had made clear the situations when courts could depart from the application of the one transaction rule. His Honour stated:

> \[41\]…There may well be circumstances where a sentencing judge may order two sentences to run consecutively even though they are in relation to offences that _do_ form part of a single transaction. One instance of this is where the straightforward application of the one-transaction rule results in the offender benefitting from the court’s failure to have regard to the enhanced culpability that is reflected in the multiplicity of the offences that have been committed…

> \[45\] Aside from this, there are other instances when it would be appropriate for the sentencing judge to impose consecutive sentences notwithstanding that to do so would entail deviating from the one transaction rule. This would be so, for instance, where:

>> (a)    it is necessary to do so in order to give sufficient weight to the interest of deterrence so as to discourage behaviour of the sort in question: see for instance _ADF v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 1 SLR 874</span> (“_ADF_”) at \[143\]; or

>> (b)    the imposition of consecutive sentences would be in keeping with the gravity of the offences: see _Law Aik Meng_ (\[27\] _supra_) at \[56\].

115    In the present case, it was clear that the sentence for the CDSA offence should run consecutively with the sentences imposed for the rioting and VCH offences, since the former was of a completely different genre. Further, there was no commonality in terms of proximity in time, purpose, or location of that offence from the offences of rioting or VCH. More importantly, there was no dispute that that the CDSA offence involved an invasion of a clearly distinct legally protected interest from those of the rioting or VCH offences.

116    However, for the two offences of rioting and VCH, the Defence had argued that these offences were committed in the same transaction and hence the sentences imposed should run concurrently. With respect, I do not agree that that concurrent sentences should be imposed for the rioting and VCH offences. I explain below.

117    First, I disagreed that the rioting and VCH offences occurred in the same transaction.

> a.     In this regard, the rioting offence involved five offenders, two of whom were not involved in the later offence of VCH. While the two offences happened within a short time of each other (the rioting offence took place on or about 1.43 am, and the VCH offence occurred between 1.53 and 1.55 am), and both offences had occurred at the void deck, it should be noted that they were distinct and separate events.

> b.     In this regard, the first offence occurred when the five rioters, including the accused, had assaulted the victim at one part of the void deck after Danish had struck the victim. After kicking and punching the victim for the rioting offence, as set out at \[35\] of the SOF, they had all disengaged from the attack and left the area, with the victim alone and lying motionless at the void deck. Thus, the riot had ended by then.

> c.     The second offence only commenced afterwards, when Zul walked down the staircase “with the intention of removing the victim from public sight and hiding his unconscious body”. He then dragged the unconscious body of the victim _to an isolated corner_ near Joy Connect, away from POLCAMs. Zul then began the second round of assault, and was later to be joined by the accused and Salman, who had arrived at that isolated corner, and who then decided to participate in causing hurt to the victim. The other two persons involved in the earlier rioting offence, namely, Danish and Effendi, were nowhere to be found.

> d.     It was thus clear that there was distinct break between the two offences, with the VCH offence taking place only after the rioting had already ended for a while, and only after the rioters had already disengaged from the original assault and had left the scene. Furthermore, not all the same people involved in rioting, were involved in the VCH offence. In addition, different events preceded the occurrence of the two offences, with the VCH offence starting when Zul tried to hide the victim’s body, while the rioting offence started after Danish had punched the victim. Even the locations of the two offences were slightly different, with the VCH offence taking place at the isolated corner of the void deck only after Zul had dragged the victim there from where the rioting had originally occurred. All these factors pointed to the two offences being separate and distinct, and not part of the same transaction.

118    Second, I agreed with the Prosecution that the rioting and VCH offences protect different legal interests. The gravamen of rioting concerned at least five offenders pursuing a common and unlawful object, and this is a crime broadly categorised as an offence against public order. In contrast, a VCH offence, even one involving multiple offenders, is in essence an offence against the person, with the purpose being the causing of hurt to the body of a particular victim.

119    Third, in line with considerations of parity, the Prosecution had highlighted that when Zul pleaded guilty earlier to the commission of his offences (see \[47\] above), he had received consecutive sentences for his rioting offence, and for his VCH offence (s 323 r/w s 34 Penal Code). It was thus incongruous to impose concurrent sentences for the current accused, who was clearly more culpable than Zul. In addition, the accused had also pleaded guilty later than Zul.

120    Separately, I also accepted the Prosecution’s argument that if I were to make the sentence for his VCH offence concurrent with the sentence for the rioting offence for the accused, his sentence for the VCH offence would be effectively subsumed within his sentence for the rioting offence. This would mean that the accused would be treated no differently from Danish and Effendi, despite the fact that the latter two were a lot less blameworthy than the accused, as Danish and Effendi were involved in only the rioting offence, while the accused was involved not only with rioting, but also in committing the subsequent VCH offence. Essentially, making the sentences concurrent would mean that the accused would effectively receive “a free pass” for committing the latter VCH offence, despite it being a serious and heinous act of violence against a defenceless and vulnerable victim.

121    Thus, “as a matter of common sense” (as per Menon CJ at \[40\] of _Shouffee)_ , it was clear that the accused had also to be punished for his VCH offence, and this would only be achieved by making the sentence for this offence run consecutively with the sentence for the rioting offence.

122    Finally, I would add that EVEN IF the rioting and VCH offences could be regarded as having been committed in the same transaction, as made clear through the exceptions cited by Menon CJ in _Shouffee_ (see \[114\] above), this does not mean that the sentences for these offences should run concurrently. In this regard, the enhanced culpability of the accused, the need to give sufficient weight to the interest of deterrence so as to discourage such violent, cruel and anti-social behaviour, and the sheer gravity of the accused’s offences, all pointed to the need to make consecutive the sentences for these two offences.

123    In short, I was of the view that the sentences for all three offences should run consecutively.

#### Totality principle

124    I come to the third and last stage of the sentencing analysis. This involves the application of the totality principle and taking a “last look” to ensure that the aggregate sentence was sufficient and proportionate to the offender’s overall criminality.

125    The Prosecution submitted that its proposed overall sentence of 68 to 76 months’ imprisonment plus six strokes of the cane for the three charges, and 476 days’ imprisonment for breach of the remission order, does not breach the totality principle. Specifically, the Prosecution argued that this global sentence was not substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences (being that of rioting which carries a sentence of up to 7 years’ (i.e. 84 imprisonment), and does not have a crushing effect on the accused. It was also in keeping with the accused’s past records.

126    My initial assessment of the sentences to be imposed for the individual offences meant that the global sentence, assessed on a preliminary basis, was 64 months’ imprisonment (i.e. 42 months, 20 months, and 2 months’ imprisonment for the rioting, VCH and CDSA offences respectively) plus six strokes of the cane for the three charges, and 476 days’ imprisonment for the breach of the remission order.

127    However, having considered the revised “usual sentencing range” for rioting, which was the most serious of the individual offences (see \[81\] above), I was of the view that the global imprisonment sentence for the principal offences could be reduced further by 6 months, to a sentence of 58 months’ imprisonment (i.e. 38 months, 18 months, and 2 months’ imprisonment for the rioting, VCH and CDSA offences respectively). Such a sentence would clearly be in line with the totality principle, and would not be considered crushing.

128    In summary, the breakdown of the final sentences for the individual charges, and the global sentence overall, is set out in the table below.

129    The global sentence is 58 months' imprisonment and six strokes of the cane, plus an enhanced sentence of 476 days' imprisonment,. His imprisonment term was backdated to 17 November 2020, which was the start date of his remand**.**

130    The accused, being dissatisfied, has filed an appeal against sentence. He is currently serving his imprisonment sentence.

131    It leaves me only to thank both the Prosecution and the Defence for their comprehensive submissions, which I have found useful in reaching a global sentence that I consider to be fair, proportionate, aligned with the sentences imposed on the co-accused persons, as well as consistent with the facts of the case and the relevant sentencing precedents and principles.
