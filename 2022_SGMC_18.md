Tort – Negligence – Contributory negligence

14 April 2022 - Judgment reserved.

### Magistrate Jonathan Ng Pang Ern:

1       This is a trial on liability in respect of a road traffic accident that occurred at a controlled junction on the night of 9 August 2017. The Plaintiff and the Defendant had approached the junction from opposite directions. The accident occurred when the Plaintiff was moving straight through the junction, while the Defendant was executing a discretionary right turn. What should the appropriate starting point for apportioning liability in such cases be? And do the facts of the present case require an adjustment to this starting point? After hearing the evidence and oral closing submissions, I reserved judgment. This is my decision.

## Background

2       It is helpful to start with an orientation of the accident location. The accident occurred at the junction where Eu Tong Sen Street and New Bridge Road meet Cantonment Road and Outram Road (the “Junction”). Eu Tong Sen Street and New Bridge Road are parallel to each other, but with the traffic flowing in opposite directions. At the Junction, a vehicle driving down New Bridge Road will have Cantonment Road, which is a two-way road, on its left and Outram Road, which is also a two-way road, on its right.

3       The Plaintiff’s pleaded case was that he was driving his taxi down Eu Tong Sen Street on 9 August 2017 at or about 9.40pm. As he approached the Junction, the traffic light was green in his favour and he moved straight through the Junction. However, as he did so, the Defendant’s vehicle suddenly executed a right turn from New Bridge Road towards Outram Road and caused a collision between the two vehicles.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) The Plaintiff commenced action against the Defendant on 25 February 2020, alleging negligence on the Defendant’s part.[^2]

4       On her part, the Defendant pleaded that she had entered the Junction when the traffic light was in her favour. She did not admit to the negligence alleged against her and averred that the matters complained of were caused or contributed to by the Plaintiff’s negligence.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3)

5       The trial on liability was fixed before me on 4 April 2022. The Plaintiff was the only witness who gave evidence at the trial. A key aspect of the Plaintiff’s evidence was the video footage taken from his front-facing in-car camera.[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4) A short, 14-second, version was played multiple times over the course of the trial, and it revealed the following events:

6       In his oral evidence, the Plaintiff stated that he could not remember if he saw the two vehicles executing right turns towards Outram Road (see timestamps 09:26:16 and 09:26:18 above). However, he agreed that there was a possibility that the vehicles driving down New Bridge Road might execute right turns towards Outram Road. The Plaintiff accepted that he did not see the Defendant’s vehicle until the accident occurred. He also accepted that the video footage did not show that he had reduced his speed, but maintained that he was not travelling at a fast speed to start with.

7       The Defendant was originally also meant to give evidence at the trial. However, on the morning of the trial, her counsel, Mr Willy Tay, informed the Court that the Defendant was outside the Court but would not be taking the stand as she had just been diagnosed with cancer and was also traumatised by the accident. As the Defendant did not attend trial for cross-examination, her affidavit of evidence-in-chief was not admitted into evidence by virtue of O 38 r 2(1) of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed).

8       Finally, there was also a traffic light sequence report from ATS Traffic Pte Ltd.[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5) This was included in the Plaintiff’s Bundle of Documents and parties agreed to have it admitted without the need to call its maker.[^6] This report was adduced to establish, among other things, that when the traffic light was green to the Plaintiff, it would also have been green to the Defendant.

## Parties’ submissions

9       It is undisputed that the traffic lights were green to both the Plaintiff and the Defendant.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7) It is also undisputed that the Plaintiff had the right of way and that, while the Defendant could execute a right turn, she had to give way to oncoming traffic from the Plaintiff’s direction. This is sometimes referred to as the “discretionary right turn scenario” and in the rest of this judgment I will adopt this terminology.

10     The crux of the trial is therefore how liability should be apportioned. Mr Tay submitted that the Plaintiff’s liability should be between 15% and 35%. In support of this, he relied on two “reference points”: (a) Scenario 7(b) in Laura Lau _et al_, _Motor Accident Guide_ (Mighty Minds Publishing Pte Ltd, 2nd Ed, 2016) (“MAG”), which apportions liability to the driver of the straight-moving vehicle in a discretionary right turn scenario at 15%; and (b) the High Court’s decision in _Ting Jun Heng v Yap Kok Hua and another_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 44</span>, which apportioned liability to the driver of a straight-moving vehicle in a discretionary right turn scenario at 35%, and which was affirmed on appeal in _Ng Li Ning v Ting Jun Heng and another_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 2 SLR 1267</span> (“_Ng Li Ning_”).

11     Although Mr Tay left the precise apportionment to the Court, he submitted that the present case was closer to _Ng Li Ning_. He highlighted that, like in _Ng Li Ning_, the accident happened at night, there were other vehicles which had already entered the Junction to turn, and the Junction was relatively large and busy. He argued that the Defendant ought to have been on a “heightened alert” because, among other things, there were two vehicles driving down New Bridge Road which had already executed right turns towards Outram Road. However, the Plaintiff did not see the Defendant until the accident occurred and also did not slow down. Indeed, the Plaintiff was travelling at a relatively fast speed. Mr Tay also stressed that before the Plaintiff had even reached the stop line, the Defendant’s vehicle was already in a “turning position”.

12     On his part, counsel for the Plaintiff, Mr Paul Yap, submitted a written opening statement wherein he tabulated a string of nine Court of Appeal and High Court cases which he said involved discretionary right turn scenarios. In seven of these cases, liability was apportioned 100-0 in favour of the driver of the straight-moving vehicle.[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8)

13     By the time of oral closing submissions, Mr Yap had come to rely on only one of these seven cases: _Ong Bee Nah v Won Siew Wan (Yong Tian Choy, third party)_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 2 SLR(R) 455</span> (“_Ong Bee Nah_”). He maintained that liability should be apportioned 100-0 in favour of the Plaintiff. His alternative submission was that the Plaintiff’s liability should only be between 5% to 10%. In response to Mr Tay’s submissions, Mr Yap submitted that _Ng Li Ning_ was an exceptional case and the Plaintiff’s liability should be nowhere near 35%.

14     Mr Yap relied on Illustration (_g)_ in s 116 of the Evidence Act 1893 and urged me to draw a “very strong adverse inference” against the Defendant for her failure to take the stand. He submitted that he would have cross-examined the Defendant on whether she had stopped before executing the discretionary right turn. Mr Yap also asked that I consider what the Plaintiff could actually see as he approached the Junction. The point here was that it was dark and there were quite a number of other vehicles travelling the in the same direction as the Defendant’s vehicle (many of which were stationary at the Junction); it would therefore have been difficult for the Plaintiff to make out the Defendant’s vehicle or to notice that it was turning. In contrast, there was hardly any, or no, traffic in the same direction as the Plaintiff’s vehicle, and so the single set of headlights from the Plaintiff’s vehicle should have been visible to the Defendant.

## Analysis

15     In the remainder of this judgment, I will first summarise the key authorities referred to by parties. Thereafter, I will consider, on the basis of these authorities, what the appropriate starting point for apportioning liability in a discretionary right turn scenario should be. Finally, I will turn to the issue of whether the facts of the present case require an adjustment to this starting point.

### The key authorities

#### MAG

16     The MAG was published in 2016. It “contains a range of liability indications for a series of different motor accident scenarios” and “gives an indication of the likely apportionment of liability of the parties involved in common accident scenarios” (MAG at p 1). However, the liability indications in the MAG are expressly stated to be non-binding and, “as the question of liability in each case depends on the particular facts and circumstances arising in that case, there will be cases where the courts may depart from the liability indications set out \[in the MAG\]” (MAG at p 2).

17     The discretionary right turn scenario is covered under Scenario 7(b) at p 39 of the MAG. This describes a scenario where “\[t\]he traffic lights are showing “green” for both Vehicle X \[_ie_, the right-turning vehicle\] and Vehicle Y \[_ie_, the straight-moving vehicle\] and the “green arrow” in favour of Vehicle X has not come on/lit up”. The MAG apportions liability at 85-15 in favour of Driver Y/the driver of the straight-moving vehicle. The explanation is as follows:

> **Reason(s):** Driver Y moving straight across the junction on “green” light has right of way, but should keep a lookout for vehicles turning across his path at the junction. Driver Y should also take evasive action to avoid a collision. Driver X making the right turn should give way to oncoming traffic from the opposite direction.

18     The MAG also highlights (at pp 53-54) a number of factors which affect the liability of the driver having the right of way at cross-junctions. Neither party contended that these apply but I highlight two at this juncture, as they were referred to by the Court of Appeal in _Ng Li Ning_ (see \[21\] below). First, where the driver having the right of way is “travelling at an excessive speed, beyond the speed limit”, his liability may be increased by 10%. Second, where the other vehicle has “crossed/substantially crossed the junction when the vehicle having the right of way collided into its rear/towards it rear”, the liability of the driver having the right of way may be increased by 5-10%.

#### Ng Li Ning

19      _Ng Li Ning_ concerned a discretionary right turn scenario. The appellant was the driver of the straight-moving vehicle (referred to as the “Nissan” in the decision). The second respondent was the driver of the right-turning vehicle (referred to as the “Taxi” in the decision). The first respondent was a passenger in the right-turning vehicle and commenced action against the appellant and the second respondent. The High Court apportioned liability at 35% on the appellant’s part and 65% on the second respondent’s part. The Court of Appeal affirmed the High Court’s decision.

20     Three aspects of the decision are worth emphasising. First, the circumstances of the accident in _Ng Li Ning_ were extreme. The appellant was found to have been speeding (the Court of Appeal used the term “charging” to describe his driving at multiple junctures); the impact was so great that the appellant’s vehicle was momentarily lifted off the road surface; and the accident caused the death of another passenger in the second respondent’s vehicle (referred to as the “rear left female passenger” in the decision). None of this was lost on the Court of Appeal, which described the accident in the following graphic terms (at \[20\]-\[22\]):

> 20    It was quite obvious, from the video footage (with sound recording) from the vehicle waiting behind the Taxi at the junction and the video footages from the vehicles waiting at the stop line of Clementi Road from the direction of the \[Ayer Rajah Expressway\] towards Upper Bukit Timah Road, that the Nissan was charging down its stretch of \[Commonwealth Avenue West (“CAW”)\] towards the junction at a recklessly high speed, seemingly oblivious to the presence of turning vehicles from the opposite direction. There were two lines of vehicles waiting to turn from both directions of CAW. With the many vehicles’ lights on, one cannot imagine the appellant not noticing the heavy presence of vehicles at the junction.

> 21    The appellant claimed that he saw the unknown vehicle making its move to turn and believed that his Nissan would not hit it if the Nissan continued at the same speed that it was travelling at. He therefore did not think of slowing down when he approached the junction. Yet, it was clear that the Nissan missed that turning vehicle’s rear end only narrowly and then smashed into the Taxi’s left side. The appellant’s expert witness called that miss a “close shave” and, having viewed the video footages, we agree.

> 22    The sound of the collision was even captured clearly in the video footage from the vehicle waiting behind the Taxi. Further, the Nissan was lifted off the road surface for a moment or two by the impact of the collision. The impact was therefore obviously very great. It sent the Taxi spinning across the junction and it was truly heart-breaking and horrific to watch the Taxi’s rear left female passenger’s head swinging wildly outside the Taxi’s rear left window, apparently having smashed her head against that window and shattered the glass. The facts showed, therefore, that the Nissan had been speeding dangerously along its stretch of CAW as it approached the junction and that the appellant was seemingly oblivious to the presence of the many vehicles waiting to turn right from the opposite end of CAW. On these facts, it was hardly surprising that the trial Judge assessed the appellant to be 35% liable for the accident for the reasons that he has spelt out.

21     Second, the Court of Appeal, while emphasising (at \[39\]) that the MAG was “meant to provide only estimates of liability in common fact patterns giving rise to motor accident disputes”, noted (at \[38\]) that the High Court’s decision was consistent with the MAG anyway:

> 38    The appellant submitted that the MAG recommends that he should bear only 25% liability based on the following reasoning. “Scenario 7(b)” in the MAG suggests that the driver of the straight-moving vehicle in the Discretionary Right Turn Scenario should bear 15% liability. The MAG further recommends that if the driver having the right of way exceeds the speed limit, his liability should be increased by 10%. On this basis, the appellant argued that he should bear 25% liability at most. However, the MAG also recommends that if the other vehicle has crossed the junction substantially, the liability of the driver having the right of way should be increased by 5% to 10% as he would have had greater opportunity to avoid the collision. The video footages showed that the second respondent had almost crossed at least the path of the Nissan at the junction when the collision occurred. If the appellant had not been charging into the junction at a dangerous speed, he would have been in a much better position than the second respondent to prevent the accident from happening. The trial Judge’s apportionment of 35% liability on the appellant’s part was therefore in keeping with the MAG anyway.

22     Third, the Court of Appeal also took pains to stress (at \[40\]) that it was “not establish\[ing\] a precedent that the relative liability of straight-moving vehicles with the right of way against turning vehicles has now been raised to 35% without qualification”. Rather, “\[t\]he appellant’s liability was assessed to be higher than most of the cases he cited simply because that degree of contributory negligence was justified on the facts”.

#### Ong Bee Nah

23     In _Ong Bee Nah_, the third party was the driver of the straight-moving vehicle. The defendant was the driver of the right-turning vehicle. The plaintiff was the third party’s wife and a passenger in the third party’s vehicle. The High Court found that the defendant was 100% liable.

24     In oral closing submissions, Mr Yap referred me to \[102\]-\[105\] of _Ong Bee Nah_:

> 102    I have already reviewed the evidence in some detail. It was clear that the third party was in fact keeping a lookout and, more importantly, the traffic lights were in his favour. He did see the defendant’s car. However, it was stationary. This is not surprising since, if the traffic lights were in the third party’s favour, the _converse_ must have been the case in so far as the defendant was concerned (see \[90\] above). It could not be otherwise unless, of course, the traffic lights had malfunctioned – which was clearly not the case here. It was to be expected, therefore, that the defendant’s car would be stationary. It could not move until the lights had turned red against the third party. At this juncture, and this juncture only, would the defendant be allowed to move her car as, at that point, the green arrow would have come on in her favour.

> 103    One must, at this point, put oneself in the third party’s shoes (or, more appropriately here, driving seat). One has only to do so to come immediately to the conclusion that there was no need to slow down (I find it significant, in this regard, that the third party did not actually increase his speed: a point which counsel for the defendant did not dispute). It is true that the defendant’s vehicle was up ahead. However, it was stationary in the right turning pocket. Placed in the third party’s situation, one would not have expected the defendant’s vehicle to have moved forward since the lights were not in its favour. In other words, there could be no reasonable probability of any danger occurring that the third party would have to guard against by, _inter alia_, slowing down his vehicle.

> 104    I should add at this juncture that slowing down one’s vehicle for no apparent reason would not only not have fulfilled any practical purpose but might also have inconvenienced other vehicles following behind. Indeed, if a vehicle was following too closely behind (_ie_, tailgating) the third party’s vehicle, this could have possibly led to an accident or even frayed nerves (all of which are, unfortunately, not uncommon on Singapore roads today).

> 105    It is true that the defendant’s vehicle did ultimately pose a danger. However, this was something that was sudden and unexpected, given the situation I described briefly in the preceding paragraph. It was certainly not an eventuality that a reasonable driver in the third party’s position ought to have guarded against. It was, at best, only “a mere possibility which would never occur to the mind of a reasonable man”, to quote, once again, the words of Lord Dunedin above (see above at \[96\]).

> \[emphasis in original\]

25     I note, parenthetically, that the references at \[102\] and \[103\] to how the lights were in the third party’s favour and how the defendant’s vehicle was rightfully stationary might give the impression that this case did not actually involve a discretionary right turn scenario. However, when read together with an earlier part of the decision, it becomes evident that that these references simply mean that the third party had the right of way. As the High Court noted (at \[90\]):

> 90    I should add that the various witnesses’ credibility was crucial to the outcome of this case. I have in mind, in particular, the issue of in whose favour the traffic lights were. There is here no middle ground: if the traffic lights were in favour of one, they must have been against the other. _Even if the defendant argues that the (main) green light was showing, this would mean that she would have had to stop at the right turn pocket simply because the traffic lights would then have been in favour of the third party. The traffic lights would only have been in her favour when they (the main lights) turned red and the green arrow was displayed._ At this point, the third party would have had to stop because the traffic lights would have been against him. \[emphasis added\]

### The appropriate starting point

26     To recap, the position taken by the aforementioned authorities is as follows:

27     In my view, the MAG’s 85-15 apportionment remains an appropriate starting point for apportioning liability in a discretionary right turn scenario. Neither _Ng Li Ning_ nor _Ong Bee Nah_ detracts from this.

28     As noted at \[20\] above, _Ng Li Ning_ was an extreme case and the Court of Appeal was very alive to this fact. Related to this, the Court of Appeal also made it clear that it was not purporting to lay down a 65-35 starting point for apportioning liability in a discretionary right turn scenario (see \[22\] above). In my view, a 35% apportionment against the driver of the straight-moving vehicle represents the higher side of the scale in a discretionary right turn scenario. This would also be consistent with how the liability of the driver of the straight-moving vehicle in _Ng Li Ning_ was the highest across the nine cases cited in Mr Yap’s opening statement.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9)

29     But even more importantly, _Ng Li Ning_ should be read as _endorsing_ (at least implicitly) the MAG’s 85-15 starting point. This can be seen from how the Court of Appeal had applied the MAG’s 85-15 starting point, made two adjustments to this to account for: (a) the straight-moving vehicle’s speed; and (b) the fact that the right-turning vehicle had crossed the junction substantially, and then concluded that the High Court’s apportionment of 35% liability against the driver of the straight-moving vehicle was “in keeping with the MAG anyway” (_Ng Li Ning_ at \[38\], which is quoted at \[21\] above).

30     As for _Ong Bee Nah_, this was an exceptional case. The High Court found that the driver of the straight-moving vehicle “was in fact keeping a lookout” and that he “did see the \[right-turning vehicle\]” but “it was stationary” (_Ong Bee Nah_ at \[102\], which is quoted at \[24\] above). Moreover, the driver of the straight-moving vehicle (who was found to be a credible witness) also gave evidence that he had jammed his brakes at the point he saw the right-turning vehicle planning to turn (_Ong Bee Nah_ at \[22\] and \[25\]).

31     It is apposite, at this juncture, to refer back to the explanation for the MAG’s 85-15 starting point, which I have quoted at \[17\] above. The 15% liability of the driver of the straight-moving vehicle arises because, although he has the right of way, he “should _keep a lookout_ for vehicles turning across his path at the junction” and “should also _take evasive action_ to avoid a collision” \[emphasis added\]. The driver of the straight-moving vehicle in _Ong Bee Nah_ had done _both_ of these things. The High Court’s finding that the driver of the right-turning vehicle was wholly liable is therefore entirely consistent with the MAG’s 85-15 starting point, notwithstanding that the decision pre-dated the MAG.

### Adjustments to the starting point

32     The MAG’s 85-15 starting point for a discretionary right turn scenario is, however, nothing more than a starting point. Adjustments in either direction can, and should, be made if the facts require. In my view, it is helpful to undertake this analysis by considering whether the facts warrant:

> (a)     an _increase_ in the liability apportioned to the driver of the _straight-moving_ vehicle;

> (b)     a _decrease_ in the liability apportioned to the driver of the _straight-moving_ vehicle;

> (c)     an _increase_ in the liability apportioned to the driver of the _right-turning_ vehicle; and

> (d)     a _decrease_ in the liability apportioned to the driver of the _right-turning_ vehicle.

33     I appreciate that, because the apportionment of liability is zero-sum in nature, (a) and (b) have the same _overall effect_ as (d) and (c) respectively: if the liability apportioned to the driver of the straight-moving vehicle is increased/decreased, then the liability apportioned to the driver of the right-turning vehicle will correspondingly decrease/increase. The same is true the other way around. Nevertheless, the liability apportioned to the driver of the straight-moving vehicle is _conceptually distinct_ from the liability apportioned to the driver of the right-turning vehicle, and this framework will help to ensure that the question of whether adjustments are required to the starting point is considered from all possible angles.

34     In addition, it is also important to, once again, refer back to the explanation for the MAG’s 85-15 starting point, which I have quoted at \[17\] above. The 15% liability of the driver of the straight-moving vehicle arises because, although he has the right of way, he “should keep a lookout for vehicles turning across his path at the junction” and “should also take evasive action to avoid a collision”. The 85% liability of the driver of the right-turning vehicle arises because he “should give way to oncoming traffic from the opposite direction”. Accordingly, the Court must be careful not to make adjustments to the starting point on the basis of facts that are _already assumed_ in this starting point. For instance, if the driver of the straight-moving vehicle is found to have failed to keep a lookout for right-turning vehicles, and there is nothing particularly aggravating about this failure, this should not be used as a basis to increase his liability. This is because his 15% liability under the MAG’s 85-15 starting point _already assumes_ a failure to keep a lookout for right-turning vehicles. To increase his liability on this basis would essentially amount to double counting.

35     With the above in mind, I first consider if there are any facts that call for an _increase_ in the apportionment of the _Plaintiff’s_ liability (see \[32(a)\] above). I have summarised Mr Tay’s submissions on this issue at \[11\] above. Many of Mr Tay’s points speak to the Plaintiff’s failure to keep a lookout. These include the points about how the two vehicles driving down New Bridge Road had already executed right turns towards Outram Road, how the Plaintiff did not see the Defendant until the accident occurred, and how the Defendant’s vehicle was already in a “turning position”. As I have already noted, such facts, unless particularly aggravating, should not be counted a second time in deciding whether an adjustment to the MAG’s 85-15 starting point is required (see \[34\] above). As for Mr Tay’s arguments relating to the Plaintiff’s speed and failure to slow down, there is no evidence that the Plaintiff had exceeded the speed limit and, absent clear and compelling circumstances to the contrary, there is also no legal duty on a driver to slow down automatically each time he approaches a junction if the lights are in his favour (_Ong Bee Nah_ at \[95\] and \[109\]). Finally, while Mr Tay sought to highlight other similarities between _Ng Li Ning_ and the present case, these similarities have more to do with the physical setting of the accident, and less to do with the relative liabilities of the Plaintiff and the Defendant. In my assessment, there are no facts that warrant an increase in the apportionment of the Plaintiff’s liability.

36     On the other hand, I consider that there is one fact that warrants a _decrease_ in the apportionment of the _Plaintiff’s_ liability (see \[32(b)\] above). As noted at \[14\] above, Mr Yap submitted that, as it was dark, it would have been difficult for the Plaintiff to make out the Defendant’s vehicle or to notice that it was turning. By itself, this is a neutral factor that cuts both ways: if it was dark for the Plaintiff, it would also have been dark for the Defendant. The critical point, however, is Mr Yap’s further submission that while there were quite a number of other vehicles travelling in the same direction as the Defendant’s vehicle (many of which were stationary at the Junction), there was hardly any, or no, traffic in the same direction as the Plaintiff’s vehicle. The Plaintiff was therefore confronted with a cluster of headlights which made it difficult for him to make out the Defendant’s vehicle or to notice that it was turning. In contrast, as Mr Yap put it, the single set of headlights from the Plaintiff’s vehicle should have been visible (and, I would add, obvious) to the Defendant. In other words, the Plaintiff’s visibility, _relative_ to the Defendant’s visibility, was poor. In my view, this fact warrants a decrease in the apportionment of the Plaintiff’s liability.

37     I also consider that there is one fact that warrants an _increase_ in the apportionment of the _Defendant’s_ liability (see \[32(c)\] above). As mentioned at \[7\] above, the Defendant did not give evidence at the trial. The purported reason for this was that she had just been diagnosed with cancer and was also traumatised by the accident. Although no evidence was provided for these claims, I do not have any reason to disbelieve them or to think that the Defendant was lying. However, as much as I empathise with the Defendant’s _present_ circumstances, the unfortunate reality is that they do not have any bearing on her liability _for the accident_. Moreover, it was always open for the Defendant to have applied, through Mr Tay, for a second tranche to be fixed for her evidence to be given. In these circumstances, I agree with Mr Yap that an adverse inference should be drawn against the Defendant pursuant to Illustration (_g_) in s 116 of the Evidence Act 1893, which provides as follows:

> **Court may presume existence of certain fact**

> **116**.    The court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct, and public and private business, in their relation to the facts of the particular case.

_Illustrations_

> The court may presume —

>> …

>> (_g_)    that evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced be unfavourable to the person who withholds it;

>> …

38     As regards the content of this adverse inference, Mr Yap submitted that he would have cross-examined the Defendant on whether she had stopped before executing the discretionary right turn (see \[14\] above). At the very least, this is one adverse inference that can be drawn. And while this certainly speaks to the Defendant’s failure to give way to oncoming traffic from the Plaintiff’s direction, which is already assumed in the MAG’s 85-15 starting point (see \[34\] above), I am of the view that it goes beyond a failure to give way _simpliciter_ because it either: (a) is an aggravated instance of a failure to give way; or (b) speaks to the separate question of whether the Defendant had kept a proper lookout. On either characterisation, it calls for an increase in the apportionment of the Defendant’s liability.

39     Finally, there is nothing on the facts that warrants a _decrease_ in the apportionment of the _Defendant’s_ liability (see \[32(d)\] above).

40     In summary, adjustments are needed to account for facts that warrant: (a) a decrease in the apportionment of the Plaintiff’s liability (see \[36\] above); and (b) an increase in the apportionment of the Defendant’s liability (see \[37\]-\[38\] above). In my view, an adjustment of 5% for each of these is appropriate. The final apportionment is therefore 95% for the Defendant and 5% for the Plaintiff.

41     As a cross-check on consistency, I take a step back and ask if this is a case where the Plaintiff should be 0% liable. In my view, it is not. As alluded to as \[35\] above, this is a case where the Plaintiff did in fact fail to keep a proper lookout. While the points highlighted by Mr Tay do not serve to increase the apportionment of the Plaintiff’s liability, they are sufficient to justify the apportionment of _some_ liability on the Plaintiff’s part.

## Conclusion

42     For the above reasons, I enter interlocutory judgment for the Plaintiff against the Defendant for 95% of the damages to be assessed. Costs are reserved to the Registrar assessing damages, but parties are at liberty to write in, within 14 days, should they wish to make any contrary submissions on costs.
