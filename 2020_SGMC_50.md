Criminal Procedure And Sentencing – Sentencing – Income Tax Act Cap 134, 2008 Rev Ed – Proposed Sentencing Framework

Criminal Procedure And Sentencing – Sentencing – Goods and Services Tax Act Cap 117A, 2005 Rev Ed

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9758/2020/01.\]

27 October 2020

### District Judge Adam Nakhoda:

## Introduction

1       The Accused, by all accounts, a successful businessman and who, at the material time, was a director of TNT Cards & Silkscreen Pte Ltd (TNTPL) and was the precedent partner of TNT Art & Silkscreen (TAS). The Accused wilfully with intent to evade tax made false entries to his income tax returns for Year of Assessment 2009 (YA2009) and Year of Assessment 2011 (YA2011). The Accused also failed to notify the Comptroller of Goods and Services of TNTPL’s liability to be registered for Goods And Services Tax (GST) by 1 May 2010.

2       The Accused pleaded guilty to two charges for offences under s96(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act (ITA) and one charge under s 61(a) read with s 74(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act (GSTA). I sentenced the Accused to a global sentence of 12 weeks’ imprisonment, fine of $2,000 in default one day’s imprisonment and the statutorily mandated penalties. The primary issue in this case was whether the Court should adopt a new sentencing framework set out by the Prosecution for tax evasion offences under the ITA.

3       The Accused being dissatisfied with the sentence has appealed. He has paid the fine, is paying the penalties by way of an instalment plan and is currently on bail pending the hearing of the appeal.

## Charges

4       The details of the three charges are as follows:

> **MSC 902422 of 2019**

> You, Tan Song Cheng, are charged that you, on 1st May 2010, in Singapore, as the director of TNT Cards & Silkscreen Pte Ltd (“TNTPL”), did fail to comply with paragraph 4(1) of the First Schedule to the Goods and Services Tax Act (Cap 117A, 2005 Rev Ed.) (“GSTA”), to wit, by failing to notify the Comptroller of Goods and Services Tax of TNTPL’s liability to be registered under paragraph 1(1)(a) of the First Schedule within 30 days after the end of the quarter ending on 31st march 2010, i.e. by 30th April 2010, which offence was committed with your consent, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 61(a) read with section 74(1) of the GSTA and punishable under section 61 of the GSTA.

> **MSC 902423 of 2019**

> You, Tan Song Cheng, are charged that you, on or about 21st March 2009, in Singapore, did wilfully with intent to evade tax, make a false entry in your income tax return for Year of Assessment 2009, to wit, by falsely stating in the said return that your total statutory income was S$111,164.00/-, when in fact the correct entry should be S$338,179.00/-, resulting in total tax undercharged amounting to $34,992.26/-, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 96(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act (Cap 134, 2008 rev. Ed) (“ITA”) and punishable under section 96(1) of the ITA.

> **MSC 902425 of 2019**

> You, Tan Song Cheng, are charged that you, on or about 11th April 2011, in Singapore, did wilfully with intent to evade tax, make a false entry in your income tax return for Year of Assessment 2011, to wit, by falsely stating in the said return that your total statutory income was S$108,219.00/-, when in fact the correct entry should be S$330,393.00/-, resulting in total tax undercharged amounting to $34,444.18/-, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 96(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act (Cap 134, 2008 rev. Ed) (“ITA”) and punishable under section 96(1) of the ITA.

## Facts

5       The Accused is Tan Song Cheng, a 59-year-old male Singaporean citizen.

6       The Accused ran TNTPL and TAS together with Mdm Lim Geok Mee (Mdm Lim). Mdm Lim was also a director of TNTPL and a partner of TAS. The Accused oversaw the sales and marketing functions for TNTPL and TAS. For the Financial Years (FY) ending 31 May 2002 to FY ending 31 May 2014, Mdm Lim prepared the general ledgers for TNTPL. Once prepared the ledgers would be provided to TNTPL’s accountant, Mr Cheam Heng Teng (Mr Cheam), for him to prepare TNTPL’s financial statements and complete and file TNTPL’s income tax returns (Form Cs)

7       Mdm Lim would tabulate TNTPL’s actual sales revenue and inform the Accused. When TNTPL’s sales revenue for a given FY exceeded the $1 million threshold for GST registration, Mdm Lim, with the approval of the Accused, would falsely reduce TNTPL’s reported sales revenue for that FY to below the $1 million threshold in the Form Cs submitted to IRAS. To make the reductions Mdm Lim would falsely adjust the figures in TNTPL’s sales, purchase and expense accounts in its general ledgers by falsely transferring TNTPL’s sales, purchases and expenses to three other business entities: (1) TAS; (2) Yitong Trading; and (3) Miko Silkscreen & Trading thereby keeping TNTPL’s sales revenue for the FY below the $1 million threshold and thus avoiding paying the GST it was liable for.

8       From 2008 to 2015, Mdm Lim also prepared TAS’ Profits and Loss Accounts and completed and filed TAS’ income tax returns (Form Ps). When TNTPL’s purchase and expenses were transferred to TAS, Mdm Lim would falsely inflate TAS’ purchases and expenses to reduce TAS’ reported net profit for each YA to a figure below $100,000. The cap of $100,000 was an artificially imposed cap agreed by the Accused and Mdm Lim. This led to an underreporting of the “Adjusted Profit” figures for TAS and the “Share of Divisible Profit/Loss” declared for each partner in TAS’ Form Ps.

9       The Accused filed his personal income tax returns (Form Bs) for YA 2009 to 2016 and he underreported his total statutory income, which comprised his employment income from TNTPL and his trade income from TAS. With regard to his employment income from TNTPL the Accused failed to report holiday reimbursement that he had received from TNTPL as a “performance reward”. As regards his trade income from TAS, the Accused, pursuant to Mdm Lim’s reduction of TAS’ reported net profits, had underreported his share of those profits.

10     The Accused admitted that he did not was to register TNTPL for GST as this would affect the profitability and competitiveness of TNTPL.

11     For YA2009, the Accused agreed to Mdm Lim’s false reduction of TAS’ net profit leading to an underreporting of the Accused’s share of TAS’ trade income. He also failed to declare the holiday reimbursement that he received form TNTPL. As a result, the Accused underreported his total statutory income by $227,015.50 and this resulted in tax undercharged amounting to $34,992.26.

12     For YA2011, the Accused underreported his share of TAS’s trade income and failed to declare the holiday reimbursements he received from TNTPL resulting in him underreporting his total statutory income by $227,174.50 and this resulted in tax undercharged amounting to $34,444.18.

13     The value of TNTPL’s taxable supplies for the four quarters beginning from the quarter ending 30 July 2009 to the quarter ending 31 March 2010, had exceeded $1 million. As such, TNTPL was liable to be registered from GST and TNTPL was required to notify the Comptroller of GST about its liability by 30 April 2010. My failing to notify the Comptroller of GST by 30 April 2010, TNTPL had committed an offence under section 61(a) GSTA and the Accused, as a director of TNTPL, had committed an offence under s 61(a) read with s 74 of the GSTA. The total amount of tax due from TNTPL Was $33,315.36.

14     Prior to pleading guilty the Accused had repaid all his outstanding personal income tax and TNTPL had repaid all its outstanding GST.

## Charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing

15     The Accused admitted to and consented for another six charges under s 96(1)(b) of the ITA being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.

## Issues to be determined

16     The issues to be determined were:

> (a)     Did the case of _Chng Gim Huat v Public Prosecutor_ \[2000\] 2 SLR (R) 360 establish a sentencing benchmark?

> (b)     Whether I should adopt the Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework in determining the appropriate sentences for the ITA offences.

> (c)     Whether the amount of income tax evaded, as a proxy for the harm caused by the offence, had been factored into the mandatory penalty portion of the sentence and, therefore, should not be considered in the calibration of the appropriate sentence of imprisonment and/or fine.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed Penalties

17     The s 96(1)(b) offence is punishable with a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years or to both. In addition, the Court must impose a mandatory penalty of treble the amount of tax which had been undercharged.

18     The section 61(a) read with section 74(1) of the GSTA offence is punishable with a fine not exceeding $10,000. In addition, the Court must impose a penalty equal to 10% of the tax due.

### Antecedents

19     The Accused had no antecedents.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

20     The Prosecution submitted that I should adopt the Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework that was predicated on a harm-culpability approach. Based on the framework, the Prosecution submitted that a global sentence of four months’ imprisonment for the section 96(1)(b) of the ITA offences and a fine of $2,000 for the s 61(a) of the GSTA offence, with the mandatory financial penalties, would be appropriate sentences.

21     The Prosecution highlighted that the Prosecution and the State Courts’ had been taking reference from the case of _Chng Gim Huat_ to calibrate the appropriate sentences for section 96(1) of the ITA offences. The Prosecution highlighted that this approach did not utilise the full range of the sentence under section 96(1) as there had been a clustering of sentences at the very low end of the sentencing range, namely sentences ranging from one weeks’ to one and a half months’ imprisonment.

22     The Prosecution submitted that previous sentences that had been imposed in cases pre-dating the present case did not show a correlation between the seriousness of the offences, as reflected by the quantum of income tax evaded or the culpability of the offender. As an example, the Prosecution pointed out that the offender in _PP v Kung Seah Lim[^1]_ who had evaded tax of $23,545.65 and the offender in _PP v Tan Hang Yang[^2]_ who had evaded tax of $434,791.63 had both been sentenced to one months’ imprisonment respectively.

23     The Prosecution also submitted that the clustering of sentences for earlier cases at the one-month benchmark undermined the seriousness of fraud-related offences under the ITA.

24     The Prosecution submitted that I was not bound by the decision in _Chng Gim Huat_ because that case was not intended to be treated as a sentencing benchmark as the case did not have the characteristics of a sentencing benchmark as laid down in _Abu Syed Chowdhury v Public Prosecutor_ \[2002\] 1 SLR (R) 182.

25     Having analysed the various sentencing approaches highlighted by the Court of Appeal in _Ng Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor_ \[2007\] 2 SLR 449, the Prosecution submitted that the sentencing framework that should be utilised for tax evasion offences should be based on the _R v Taueki_ \[2005\] 3 NZLR 372 methodology of using a two-staged approach giving heed to both offence and offender specific factors.

26     The Prosecution proposed a sentencing framework that was anchored in a harm-culpability analysis. The Prosecution proposed to use the five-step framework set out in _Logachev Vladislay v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 12</span> as follows:

> (a)     Step 1: Identifying the level of harm and culpability of the offender. The Prosecution submitted that the primary determinant of harm in tax evasion offences was the **quantum of tax evaded**. The Prosecution proposed the following table listing out the factors affecting harm and culpability:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="50.58%"> <col width="49.42%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="b" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Offence-specific factor (non-exhaustive)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><u>Factors going towards harm</u></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1.

Abuse of position and breach of trust – e.g. did the offender breach any position of trust in committing the offence</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

> (b)     Step 2: Identifying the applicable indicative sentencing range. The Prosecution proposed a harm-culpability matrix should be utilised to determine the indicative starting sentence. The Prosecution submitted that the level of harm should be predominantly determined by the amount of tax loss to the State and less so by the other three factors referred to in the table at paragraph \[26(a)\] above. The Prosecution proposed the following matrix:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="24.1151769646071%"> <col width="25.2949410117976%"> <col width="25.2949410117976%"> <col width="25.2949410117976%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Level 1 Harm (below $75,000 evaded)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Level 2 Harm (between $75,000 to $150,000 evaded)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Level 3 Harm (above $150,000 evaded)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Low Culpability</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Up to 6 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6 to 12 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">12 to 18 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Moderate Culpability</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6 to 12 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">12 to 18 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">18 to 24 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>High Culpability</b></p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">12 to 18 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">18 to 24 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">24 to 36 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

> (c)     In the Prosecution’s Reply Submissions, the Prosecution submitted that the quantum of evaded taxes that were used to calibrate the three level of harms had not been arrived at in an arbitrary manner. The Prosecution submitted that they had considered all section 96(1) charges that had been brought since _Chng Gim Huat_ and had found that approximately 75% of those charges involved a quantum of evaded taxes up to $75,000. The remaining 25% of the charges were equally distributed between the other two ranges, i.e. between $75,000 to $150,000 and above $150,000.

> (d)     Step 3: Identifying the starting point within the indicative sentencing range.

> (e)     Step 4: Adjusting the starting point to consider offender-specific mitigating and aggravating factors. The Prosecution proposed that the Court consider the following non-exhaustive factors:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="50.02%"> <col width="49.98%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Offender-specific mitigating factors</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Offender-specific aggravating factors</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Pleaded guilty</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Relevant antecedents</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Cooperation with the authorities</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">TIC charges</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Offender’s remorse</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Lack of remorse</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Personal circumstances of the offender</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Taking active steps to avoid detection / thwart investigations</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

> (f)     Step 5: Adjustment to the sentence to consider the one transaction rule and the totality principle.

27     Applying the matrix to the current case, the Prosecution submitted that that based on the quantum of tax evaded in the two proceeded charges the harm would be Level 1 harm. The Prosecution also submitted that the Accused’s culpability was in the low culpability range as his modus operandi was not sophisticated and it did not involve attempts to obfuscate or to falsify source documents. The indicative sentencing range would be a sentence of up to six months’ imprisonment. The Prosecution submitted that an appropriate starting point would be three months’ imprisonment for each charge.

28     The Prosecution highlighted that the six TIC charges that the Accused had consented to were aggravating factors. The Prosecution accepted that as the Accused had pleaded guilty, had been cooperative during the investigations and had made full restitution the sentence should be adjusted to two months’ imprisonment per charge for the ITA charges. Finally, the Prosecution submitted that the sentences for both ITA charges should run consecutively and that this would not offend neither the one transaction run nor the totality rule.

29     For the section 61(a) GSTA charge the Prosecution submitted that a fine of $2,000 was in line with the sentencing precedents.

### Mitigation

30     The Defence submitted that I was bound by the decision in _Chng Gim Huat._ The Defence submitted that the principles to be applied in relation to sentencing precedents could be found in the case of _Public Prosecutor v UI_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGCA 35</span>. The Defence submitted that I, sitting as a lower court, was:

> (a)     Bound by the guidance given by established sentencing precedents decided upon by the higher courts; and

> (b)     A lower court should give cogent reasons if it wishes to depart form such precedents but that the lower court should, more properly, express disagreement with the sentencing benchmarks and leave the consideration of of the correctness of the benchmarks and/or a sentencing framework to the High Court.

31     The Defence submitted that the Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework was flawed because it did not consider other factors that would go towards the harm caused by the offence. The Defence argued that using the quantum of tax evaded as a measure of the harm was arbitrary. Referring to the Prosecution harm-culpability matrix, paragraph \[26(b)\] above, the Defence submitted that the level of harm was determined by the quantum of tax evaded alone and did not take into account other factors such as the involvement of a syndicate etc.

32     The Defence also submitted that the quantum of tax evaded and it’s relationship to the level of harm was similarly arbitrary as the Prosecution had provided no basis for his categorisation of the three levels of harm based on the quantum of tax evaded. The Defence submitted that the periods of imprisonment were also arbitrary. The Defence submitted that the sentencing matrix did not allow for the imposition of a fine and as such did not utilise the full sentencing spectrum.

33     In the Defence’s Reply Submissions, the Defence further submitted that the Prosecution’s framework was erroneous because the using the amount of tax evaded as a proxy for the harm caused by the offence would amount to double counting of this factor. This is because the amount of tax evaded forms the basis for the imposition of the mandatory penalty of treble the tax evaded. Therefore, since the quantum of evaded tax is used to determine one part of the sentence, the mandatory treble penalty, it should not be used to determine the level of harm caused by the offence.

34     The Defence submitted that there were mitigating factors, including, that the Accused had pleaded guilty at the first possible instance, that he had cooperated with the investigations, that he had made full restitution, that he was untraced, that he was the sole breadwinner, that he had medical ailments and that a long custodial sentence would have a deleterious effect on his businesses. The Defence submitted that I should sentence the Accused to three weeks’ imprisonment for both offences and order that they run concurrently. With regard to the section 61(a) GSTA offence, the Defence submitted that I should impose a fine of $1,000.

### Decision on Sentence

#### Relevant legislative provisions

35     The relevant legislative provision of the ITA are as follows:

> **96.** —(1)    Any person who wilfully with intent to evade or to assist any other person to evade tax, or to obtain or to assist any other person to obtain a PIC bonus or a higher amount of PIC bonus, or both –

>> …

>> (_b_)    makes any false statement or entry in any return made under this Act or in any notice made under section 76(8)

>> …

> shall be guilty of an offence for which, on conviction, he shall pay a penalty of treble –

>> (_a_)    the amount of tax;

>> …

> as the case may be, that has been undercharged, obtained, or undercharged and obtained as a result of the offence, or that would have been undercharged, obtained, or undercharged and obtained if the offence had not been detected, and shall also be liable to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both

36     The relevant provision of the GSTA are as follows:

> **61.** – (1)    Any person who –

>> (_a_)    fails to comply with paragraphs 4, 5, 6 or 15(2) and (3) of the First Schedule (duty to notify liability for registration or change in nature of supplies, etc., by a person exempted from registration); or

>> …

> shall be guilty of an offence and shall on conviction –

>> (i)    pay a penalty equal to 10% of the tax due in respect of each year or part thereof commencing from the date on which he is required to make the notification or to apply for registration, as the case may be;

>> (ii)   be liable to a fine not exceeding $10,000; and

>> (iii)   be liable to a further penalty of $50 for every day during which the offence continues after conviction.

#### Does Chng Gim Huat establish a sentencing benchmark for section 96(1) offences?

37     In _Abu Syed Chowdhury_ Yong CJ, at \[15\] stated:

> “A “benchmark” is a sentencing norm prevailing on the mind of every judge, ensuring consistency and therefore fairness in a criminal justice system. It is not cast in stone, nor does it represent an abdication of the judicial prerogative to tailor criminal sanctions to the individual offender. It instead provides **the focal point against which sentences in subsequent cases, with differing degrees of criminal culpability, can be accurately determined.** A good “benchmark” decision therefore lays down **carefully the parameters of its reasoning in order to allow future judges to determine what falls within the scope of the “norm”, and what exceptional situations justify a departure from it**”.

\[ **Emphasis added**\]

38     Therefore, in order for a decision to create a benchmark sentence it should meet the two criteria emphasised in the excerpt at paragraph \[37\] above.

39     The appellant in _Chng Gim Huat_ had appealed against his conviction and the sentence imposed for offences of evasion of tax under section 96(1) ITA. Yong CJ disagreed with the appellant’s submission that he should be sentenced to a fine rather than a sentence of imprisonment. Yong CJ stated that the public interest was significant in tax evasion cases as the offences “were grave and were tantamount to a deliberate fraud on the State” and that the offences affect society as a whole resulting in the State’s revenue having to be made up by other taxpayers. In addition, he found tax evasion offences were often difficult to detect and as such he held that “a custodial sentence should normally be imposed in order to meet the needs of general deterrence”: see _Chng Gim Huat_ at \[107\].

40     The Appellant in _Chng Gim Huat_ had with wilful intent to evade tax omitted to include a sum of $290,000 from his income tax return for YA1995 and a sum of $1,024.000 from his income tax return for YA1996, resulting in a global tax undercharged of $354,645.65 for the two YAs. Yong CJ allowed the Appellant’s appeal against sentence and reduced the sentences imposed by the Magistrate to one months’ imprisonment for the first charge and two months’ imprisonment for the second charge.

41     I found that apart from stating that a custodial sentence should be the norm for offences under section 96(1) of the ITA, Yong CJ did not, by his decision in _Chng Gim Huat_, establish a sentencing benchmark for such offences. First, Yong CJ did not explicitly state in _Chng Gim Huat_ that the decision should be utilised as a sentencing benchmark. Second, Yong CJ did not address how the harm caused by such offences should be calibrated nor did he address the factors that would affect an offender’s degree of culpability or the interplay between the harm caused and the culpability of the offender. Therefore, I found that _Chng Gim Huat_ did not provide a focal point against which sentences in subsequent cases could take reference form.

42     However, I did find that I could take guidance from _Chng Gim Huat_ in determining the appropriate sentence for section 96(1) ITA offences, in particular, the principle that a custodial sentence should be the starting point for such offences. Also Yong CJ referred to Hong Kong Court of Appeal decision in _AG v Ma Lai Wu_ \[1987\] HKLR 744 as providing useful guidance on the governing factors to be considered in deciding on the appropriate sentence for tax evasion offences: see _Chng Gim Huat_ at \[108\]. Silke JA held in _Ma Lai Wu_ at \[747D – 747G\]:

> “… We think that, in Hong Kong, … sentences of immediate custodial imprisonment should in future be imposed in the appropriate cases.

> _It is necessary for a court to take into consideration when assessing the quantum of such sentence – and this list is not intended to be exhaustive –_ **_the time span of the offences, the systems and methods used to evade tax, where or not there was re-payment of the tax evaded, the amount of tax, the individual culpability of one or more defendants and the circumstances of each defendant_** _”_

\[ **Emphasis added**\]

43     I found that these are clearly factors that should be considered when determining the appropriate sentence for offences under section 96(1). I would note that the Prosecutions proposed sentencing framework incorporated these factors (and more) at Steps 1 and 4 of the framework.

44     A perusal of the section 96(1) of the ITA charges that have been sentenced since Yong CJ’s decision in _Chng Gim Huat_ would disclose that the Courts have not imposed sentences longer than the two months’ imprisonment imposed for the second charge in that case. It is clear that since _Chng gim Huat_ the full sentencing range has not been utilised. Therefore, I found that I was not bound to follow the decision in _Chng Gim Huat_ in the sense that it established a sentencing benchmark of a short custodial sentence of up to two months for section 96(1) ITA offences.

#### Is there a need to re-consider how sentences are calibrated for section 96(1) offences?

45     The Defence submitted that it was not proper for me to depart from sentencing precedents established by a higher court: see _UI_ at \[17\]. However, in _UI_, Chan CJ also recognised that a lower court could depart from such precedents if the court gave cogent reasons for the departure.

46     As stated above I found that _Chng Gim Huat_ did not establish a sentencing benchmark apart from establishing the principle that a custodial sentence should be the norm for offences of tax evasion under section 96(1) of the ITA. I found that there were cogent reasons for me to depart from the sentencing trend of imposing sentences up to two months’ imprisonment for offences under section 96(1) of the ITA that had been established since _Chng Gim Huat._

47     First, I found that there was no consistency in the sentences imposed for section 96(1) offences since _Chng Gim Huat_ except that sentences were always under two months’ imprisonment. In the present case, the Prosecution tendered a breakdown of 25 cases involving 49 charges under section 96(1) of the ITA that had been sentenced since _Chng Gim Huat_ had been decided[^3]. It was immediately apparent from this table that in terms of the length of imprisonment the high water mark was the sentence of two months’ imprisonment imposed on the Appellant in _Chng Gim Huat_ for the second charge involving tax undercharged of $276,471.26.

48     Shorter sentences have been imposed for charges where the amount of tax undercharged was significantly higher than the tax undercharged in the second charge in _Chng Gim Huat._ In _Public Prosecutor v Tan Hang Yang[^4]_ the tax undercharged for the first proceeded charge was $434,791.63 and for the second proceeded charge was $387,750.64. The offender was sentenced to one months’ imprisonment per charge, a sentence obviously shorter than the sentence for the second charge in _Chng Gim Huat._

49     At the other end of the spectrum, the offender in _PP v Ng Hai Hock[^5]_ was sentenced to six weeks’ imprisonment respectively for two charges, one involving a tax undercharge of $23,243.26 and the other involving a tax undercharge of $20.021.69. The amount of tax undercharged in _Ng Hai Hock_ for both proceeded charges were far below the tax undercharged in the first charge in _Chng Gim Huat_ and despite this a higher sentence was imposed on the offender in _Ng Hai Hock._

50     I recognise that for the cases I have referred to as a comparison to _Chng Gim Huat_, there may have been other factors that either increased or decreased the offenders culpability resulting in either comparatively shorter or longer sentences. However, it was clear to me that there was little or no correlation between the amount of tax evaded and the sentence imposed for cases and charges decided post-_Chng Gim Huat._ As such, I agreed with the Prosecution that there was a need for a more principled approach to sentencing that utilised a sentencing framework.

51     Second, the current sentencing norm clearly does not utilise the full sentencing spectrum provided for by Parliament as sentences that have been imposed post-_Chng Gim Huat_ appear to cluster at the very low end of the sentencing range, i.e. between one weeks’ to six weeks’ imprisonment. I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that it was of “paramount importance” that the Court utilise the full sentencing range. Taking reference only from the sentences imposed in _Chng Gim Huat_ and the sentences imposed in the precedent cases and treating these as a benchmark would continue to result in sentences remaining at the lower end of the sentencing range for tax evasion offences.

52     Third, as held by Yong CJ in _Chng Gim Huat_, tax evasion offences are “tantamount to a deliberate fraud on the State” and that general deterrence must be the primary sentencing consideration. I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that the clustering of sentences below two months’ imprisonment undermined the seriousness of the section 96(1) of the ITA offence and lessened the deterrent effect of sentences.

53     Therefore, I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that there was a need to re-consider how sentences for these offences are calibrated.

#### Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework

54     I agreed that the appropriate forum to adopt the Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework would be an Appellate Court. However, in view of the fact that I found that the present sentencing norm was inadequate for the reasons stated at paragraphs \[47\] to \[52\] I found that I could take guidance from the Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework in order to calibrate the appropriate sentences for the present offences.

55     I found that the Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework that was based on a harm-culpability analysis provided a rational and principled basis for calibrating the appropriate sentence. I agreed that the five-step sentencing framework proposed by the Prosecution was the correct approach.

56     At step 1, with regards to the factors going towards harm I agreed with the Prosecution that the primary factor to be considered was the amount of tax evaded. Using the amount of tax evaded as a proxy for the harm caused to the State by the offence was appropriate as it was a measure of the resources that the offender had deprived the State and which would have to be made up by other taxpayers: see _Chng Gim Huat_ at \[107\].

57     I did not agree with the Defence submission that the Prosecution was arbitrary in the manner it segregated the levels of harm in accordance with the quantum of tax evaded. The Prosecution provided a cogent reason for establishing that if the amount of tax evaded was below $75,000 then this would equate to Level 1 harm as 75% of the charges proceeded on post-_Chng Gim Huat_ involved sums below $75,000. Based on this historical review the majority of cases that come before the Court would involve Level 1 harm. Level 2 and level 3 harm would be reserved for the most egregious cases which would often be measured by the amount of tax evaded. Therefore, I found that the Prosecution’s calibration of the three levels of harm was reasonable.

58     However, I did find that whilst the level of tax evaded was the primary consideration in the level of harm caused by the offence, I had to also consider whether the other harm factors, namely, whether the offence was syndicated, whether it was transnational or whether it undermined the Government were present. I found that if these other factors were not present then after the indicative starting range was obtained the sentence starting point should be adjusted downwards.

59     I did not agree with the Defence’s submission that the calibration of the imprisonment terms appeared arbitrary. As submitted by the Prosecution, this was an expected consequence as this was a proposed sentencing framework that has not been considered or endorsed by the High Court. However, the calibration of the sentences takes into account the entire spectrum of the sentencing range and as such I found that it was a reasonable calibration of the range of sentences to be imposed depending on an offender’s relative level of harm and culpability.

60     I accepted the Prosecution’s list of factors affecting culpability except that I found that steps taken by the offender to avoid detection and/or thwart the investigations should be included as a factor determining the offender’s culpability and not an offender-specific aggravating factor.

61     With regards to the sentencing matrix at Step 3 of the framework, I disagreed that the framework did not allow for the imposition of fines. The sentencing range for low harm and low culpability was a sentence up to a six months’ imprisonment. There was no statutory requirement or indication in the table that a sentence of imprisonment is mandatory. It was conceivable that where the amount of tax evaded is very low and the level of culpability is similarly extremely low a starting sentence of a fine could be assessed at Step 3. However, I would also point out the it was clear from _Chng Gim Huat_ that a custodial sentence should be the norm for tax evasion offences and, therefore, it will be rare that a non-custodial sentence would be justified.

62     Therefore, I used the Prosecution’s proposed 5-step sentencing framework to calibrate the appropriate sentences in the present case.

#### Whether the level of harm caused by the offence, in terms of the tax evaded, is addressed in the form of the mandatory treble penalty

63     The Defence contended that the quantum of taxes evaded should have little weight in determining the level of harm caused by the offence because the amount of tax evaded was accounted for by the mandatory treble penalty. The Defence submitted that as the quantum of the penalty was directly based on the quantum of taxes evaded to then consider the amount of tax evaded as a proxy for the harm caused by the offence would result in double-counting of a sentencing factor.

64     I disagreed with the Defence submission that the quantum of the tax evaded should not be considered as an element of the harm caused by the offence. This would amount to the Defence arguing that the quantum of tax evaded, as a sentencing consideration, should be ignored as it has already been utilised to in the imposition of the treble penalty. However, the Defence did not provide any authority for this submission.

65     In _Chng Gim Huat_ Yong CJ, at paragraph \[110\], in finding that the imposition of a fine was manifestly inadequate referred to the fact, _inter alia_, that the quantum of the “total tax evaded was substantial”. I found that the fact that Yong CJ had referred to the quantum of tax evaded as one of the reasons why a custodial sentence was merited demonstrates that he felt that the quantum of tax should be considered as a sentencing factor when determining the appropriate sentence for an offence under section 96(1) of the ITA.

66     I found that the most appropriate proxy to determine the level of harm caused by the offences would be the amount of tax evaded. I would endorse the Prosecution’s submissions that the “harm caused \[by the offence\] is the tax deprived as a result of the offending conduct, which in turn is the benefit deprived from not being able to utilise the tax for society”[^6]. The Prosecution, in their Reply Submissions, submitted that tax evasion had the effect of “frustrat\[ing\] the intention of the Government in being able to effectively to \[sic\] regulate inequality and from funding and carrying out essential functions and programs.[^7]” Therefore, I found that in terms of the harm that is caused to the Government and society as a result of tax evasion the only metric available to consider wsa the quantum of tax evaded.

67     The Defence submitted that the Prosecution’s proposed framework was based on the framework in _Logachev Vladislav_ and the Defence argued that this was flawed because there was no element of mandatory penalties for offences under the Casino Control Act (Cap 33A, 2007 Rev Ed). In _Logachev Vladislav_, Menon CJ had held that the amount cheated was a factor to be considered in determining the level of harm. I disagreed with the Defence’s submission. As stated above at \[64\] that the Defence did not have any authority for this proposition and, more importantly, at paragraph \[65\], that Yong CJ had endorsed using the quantum of tax evaded to determine both the appropriate sentence and the mandatory penalty.

#### Application of the sentencing framework to the present case

68     Having found that I will be guided by the Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework I have applied the framework to the present case.

##### (1)   Step 1

69     With regard to the harm caused I noted that the quantum of tax evaded by the Accused was about $34,000 for each of the proceeded charges and that there were no other harm factors present. As such, I found that the level of harm was low and that for the purposes of the table at paragraph \[26(b)\] above I classified the harm as “Level 1 Harm”.

70     With regard to the Accused’s culpability, I found that there was a degree of planning and premeditation. The Accused, along with Mdm Lim, had concocted a scheme to ensure that TNTPL’s sales revenue never exceeded $1 million in order to avoid the necessity of GST registration. Consequently, they had to falsely adjust its sales figures by transferring some of its sales to, _inter alia_, TAS. The Accused and Mdm Lim had also agreed to ensure that TAS’ net profit should be kept below $100,000 resulting in them falsely inflating TAS’ purchases and expenses. A corollary of this was that there was underreporting of the profit declared by TAS that was payable to the Accused and Mdm Lim resulting, partly, in the underreporting of the Accused’s taxable income. In addition, the Accused had also deliberately failed to report holiday reimbursements that he received from TNTPL as part of his taxable income.

71     Thus I found that there was a clear scheme put in place by the Accused and Mdm Lim and this was primarily aimed at maintaining the profitability and competitiveness of TNTPL by not registering it for GST. However, it did not appear to me that the primary aim of the scheme was for the Accused to evade income tax.

72     There was no evidence that the Accused had used sophisticated means or methods to evade his income tax. The Statement of Facts was also silent on the level of falsification that the Accused and Mdm Lim used to disguise their scheme. I accept that this scheme was in place for a long period, i.e. from YA2009 to YA2016 (as evidence by the TIC charges) and I have taken this into account in determining the Accused’s relative culpability. It would appear that only the Accused and Mdm Lim were involved in the scheme and it was not clear from the Statement of Facts that either of them was the mastermind. I also found that in carrying out this scheme the Accused had not additionally abused his position or been involved in any other breach of trust.

73     Based on these factors, I found that the Accused’s culpability fell within the “Low Culpability” band.

##### (2)   Step 2

74     Based on the level of harm and the culpability, I found that the applicable sentencing range would be a sentence of imprisonment of up to six months’.

##### (3)   Step 3

75     Based on the quantum of tax evaded and the Accused’s low culpability the Prosecution submitted that a starting sentence of three months’ imprisonment would be appropriate. However, I found that as the other harm factors were not present the starting sentence should be lower than the sentence proposed by the Prosecution. I found that a starting sentence of ten weeks’ imprisonment was appropriate.

##### (4)   Step 4

76     The primary aggravating factor in the present case was that the Accused had consented to six other charges under section 96(1) of the ITA being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. The quantum of tax evaded in the TIC charges amounted to $119,186.21. I found that this was a considerable sum and the effect of the TIC charges should be an uplift in the sentence to be imposed for each of the proceeded charges.

77     I accepted that the Accused had pleaded guilty at the earliest possible opportunity and that this was an indication of his genuine remorse. I also noted that the Accused was cooperative with IRAS during their investigation, this stands in contrast to other cases where the Accused may continue to obfuscate and hinder the investigations. The Accused’s cooperation merited a discount in the sentence. The Accused had made full restitution of all the tax that he had evaded for both the proceeded and the TIC charges. I found that this was a weighty mitigating factor, as stated by Yong CJ making restitution was a significant indication of the Accused’s desire to make amends: see _Chng Gim Huat_ at \[112\]. Finally, I accepted that the Accused was untraced.

78     I did not give any mitigating weight to the Accused’s submission that his family would suffer as a result of his incarceration as this is a concomitant of a sentence of imprisonment. Nor did I give weight to his medical conditions as these did not appear so severe as to merit a significant discount in his sentence. Finally, I did not accept that the effect that his incarceration may have on his businesses was a mitigating factor.

79     Having balanced the aggravating factors with the mitigating factors that I found should be considered I imposed a discount of one-third to the starting sentence. I found that a sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment was appropriate for both charges.

##### (5)   Step 5

80     I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that as both offences were in respect separate YAs they are distinct offences that do not form part of the same conduct and are not proximate in time. As such, I agreed that consecutive sentences would not breach the one transaction rule. I found that the global sentence of 12 weeks imprisonment does not offend against the totality principle either.

#### Default sentence for the mandatory penalty.

81     The Defence had submitted that with respect to the default sentence to be imposed for the mandatory penalty that I should impose a term of one weeks’ imprisonment for every $30,000 penalty imposed. Conversely, the Prosecution submitted that a default sentence of one weeks’ imprisonment for every $10,000 penalty imposed would be appropriate.

82     Menon CJ has stated that an in default sentence is not to be taken as a proxy for the punishment imposed for the original offence and that the purpose of an in default sentence is to prevent the evasion of the fine: _Yap Ah Lai v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 3 SLR 180</span> at \[18\]. I agreed that an in default sentence of one weeks’ imprisonment for every $10,000 penalty imposed would be reasonable as it would serve to prevent evasion of the payment of the penalty and that the total in default sentence that would be imposed for both charges, i.e. 20 weeks’ imprisonment was not crushing.

83     At the conclusion of the sentencing the Accused applied for an instalment plan to pay the fine and mandatory penalty and I granted him a 12-month instalment plan. The Accused has diligently paid all instalments that have come due.

## Conclusion

84     With regard to the fine for the section 61(1)(a) of the GSTA offence, having perused the Prosecution’s sentencing precedents I found that a fine of $2,000 was appropriate. This fine was slightly higher than the fine proposed by the Defence. I found that the fine was appropriate, and it cannot be said to manifestly inadequate.

85     Finally, I found that a global sentence of 12 weeks’ imprisonment for the ITA offences was not disproportionate to the scale of the Accused’s offending and it was not a crushing sentence.

86     Finally, I would express my gratitude to the Prosecution and Defence for their well-reasoned arguments, both written and oral, and the invaluable assistance that they rendered to me.
