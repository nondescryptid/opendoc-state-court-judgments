### District Judge Ng Cheng Thiam:

## Introduction

1       The Accused pleaded guilty to a charge of using criminal force to outrage the modesty of a 13 year old female (hereinafter referred to as “the Victim”). This is an offence punishable under s 354(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”). It was stated in the charge that the Accused has used his right hand to rub against the Victim’s vagina over her clothes.

2       The Accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (‘SOF’) (see paragraph \[7\] below) without qualification. I found him guilty and convicted him accordingly.

3       After his conviction on the s 354(2) PC offence, the Accused admitted to, and gave his consent, for an offence of attempting to procure the commission of an indecent act on the Victim under s 7(a) of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38, Rev Ed 2001) to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. This offence shall be referred to as the TIC charge.

4       On 5 March 2015, the Accused was convicted of an offence of Consumption of a Specified Drug (see \[8\] below). The Accused was given a sentence of five years’ imprisonment for the said offence (see Exhibit P5). On 31 May 2018, the Accused was granted a remission order on the said sentence. The remission order was made by the Commission of Prisons under s 50I of the Prisons Act (Cap. 247, Rev Ed 2014) (“the Prisons Act”). Pursuant to the remission order, the remaining portion of the Accused’s sentence from 31 May 2018 to 28 January 2020 (both dates inclusive) was suspended. (See Exhibit P3). During the period of the remission order, the Accused was required to comply with the basic condition in accordance with section 50S(1) of the Prisons Act. By committing the aforementioned s 354(2) PC offence whilst the remission order was still operative, the Accused was deemed to have breached the basic condition on the date of the offence. Thus, upon his conviction for the s 354(2) PC offence, the Accused was liable to enhanced sentencing of up to 578 days of imprisonment under s 50T(1)(_a_) of the Prisons Act. This is in addition to the sentence he would be receiving for the s 354(2) PC offence.

5       For the s 354(2) PC offence, I imposed a sentence of 20 months’ imprisonment. On the issue of enhanced sentencing under s 50T(1)(_a_) of the Prisons Act, I imposed an imprisonment term of 400 days. By operation of the law, the two imprisonment terms are to run consecutively. As such, the total sentence imposed was an imprisonment term of 20 months and 400 days.

6       The Accused, being dissatisfied with the sentence, has filed an appeal against the sentence. The Accused is currently in prison serving sentence.

## Statement of Facts

7       The portions of the SOF which are pertinent to the commission of the s 354(2) PC offence are reproduced below. I have edited paragraph \[2\] of the SOF to protect the identity of the Victim.

> (A)     PARTIES

> 1.    The Accused is Nawas Khan Bin Kassim, male, 60 years old bearing NRIC No.: XXX, Singapore Citizen. He is unemployed.

> 2.    The Victim, …, a female, was 13 years old at the material time.

> 3.    At the material time, the Accused was introduced to the Victim as the boyfriend of the Victim’s maternal grandaunt.

> (B)     FIRST INFORMATION REPORT

> 4.    On 15 December 2018 at about 9.01 pm, the Victim lodged a police report at Bedok North Neighbourhood Police Centre, stating that she was molested.

> (C)     FACTS PERTAINING TO THE CHARGE

> 5.    Sometime in 9.23pm. Sometime in June 2018, the Accused called Victim on her handphone, asking whether she was interested in going grave visiting together with the Accused and her grandaunt. The Victim agreed to accompany the Accused and her grandaunt. The Accused then told the victim that they would be meeting a few days later.

> 6.    On the morning of the agreed date, as the Victim was getting ready to leave her home, the Accused called the Victim on her handphone. He instructed her to take a taxi and to meet him near Block 49 Dorsett Road (the “Block”). The Victim complied with the Accused’s instructions and arrived at the Block, where the Accused was waiting by the roadside and paid for the Victim’s taxi fare.

> 7.    When the Victim alighted from the taxi, the Accused informed her that he had to meet a friend who was residing on the 10th floor of the Block. The Accused asked the Victim to accompany him to visit his friend, and the Victim agreed.

> 8.    The Accused and the Victim then proceeded to the 10th floor of the Block, where the Accused led the Victim to the staircase landing of the Block. When the pair arrived at the staircase landing, the Accused sat on the steps and told the Victim to sit next to him, which the Victim complied to.

> 9.    The Accused then began making conversation with the Victim. As the Accused was talking to the Victim, he used his right hand to touch the Victim’s left thigh. The Accused then continued to use his right hand to touch the Victim’s vagina over her pants, and proceeded to rub the Victim’s vagina in an upward and downwards motion over her pants. The Accused did so with the intent to outrage the Victim’s modesty.

> 10.    The Victim initially remained quiet as she was afraid that the Accused would use force on her if she retaliated.

> 11.    The Accused then attempted to slip his right hand into the Victim’s pants via her waistband. At this juncture, the Victim grabbed the Accused’s right hand and told him that she did not like what he was doing. The Victim pushed the Accused’s right hand away, stood up, and walked quickly towards the 10th floor lift lobby. The Accused followed the Victim and they waited for the lift together.

> 12.    While waiting for the lift, the Accused passed the Victim a $50 note and told her not to tell anyone about the incident outlined in paragraphs \[9\]-\[11\] above. When the pair alighted from the lift on the ground floor, they parted and went their separate ways.

> 13.    Due to the incident, the Victim suffered flashbacks of the incident and panic attacks. She also felt scared whenever she saw men who resembled the Accused.

> 14.    Sometime in December 2018. the Victim decided to tell her grandparents about the incident outlined in paragraphs \[9\]-\[11\] above, who then informed the Victim’s parents. The Victim’s parents then brought the Victim to a police station to lodge the police report referenced in \[4\] above.

## Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

### Outrage of Modesty punishable under s 354(2) PC

9       The Prosecution sought an imprisonment term of at least 20 months’ imprisonment, comprising 18 months’ imprisonment and 2 months’ imprisonment in lieu of caning.

10     The Prosecution relied on the High Court’s decision in _GBR v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1048</span> (“_GBR_”) which has set out a sentencing guideline for an offence of aggravated outrage of modesty under s 354(2) PC.

11     In _GBR_, the High Court laid out the following three-step sentencing framework for a s 354(2) PC offence:

> Step 1 Consider the offence-specific factors comprising of

> (a)     Degree of sexual penetration;

> (b)     Circumstances of the offence;

> (c)     Harm caused to the victim, whether physical or psychological.

> Within each category, there are other factors that a sentencing court should consider _e.g._ the part of the victim’s body the accused touched, the duration of the outrage of modesty, whether there is skin-to-skin contact, presence of premeditation, use of force or violence, abuse of a position of trust, exploitation of a vulnerable victim, _etc._ (See _GBR_ at \[27\] – \[30\])

> Step 2 Once the gravity of the offence has been ascertained based on the non-exhaustive factors in Step 1, the sentencing court should place the offence within an appropriate band of imprisonment which is summarised below:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="12.82%"> <col width="42.3%"> <col width="24.78%"> <col width="20.1%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Band</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Description</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Sentencing Guideline</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Caning</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">This includes cases that do not present any, or at most one of the aggravating factors, for example, those that involve a fleeting touch or a touch over the clothes of the victim, and do not involve the intrusion into the victim’s private parts.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Less than one year’s imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Generally not imposed</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Where two or more of the aggravating factors present themselves.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">One to three years’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">At least 3 strokes of the cane</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Where numerous of the aggravating factors present themselves, including the exploitation of a particularly vulnerable victim, a serious abuse of trust, and/or the use of violence or force on the victim.</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Three to five years’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">At least 6 strokes of the cane</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

> (See _GBR_ at \[31\] – \[38\])

> Step 3 The sentencing court must take into account aggravating and mitigating factors which relate to the offender generally, but which are not offence-specific. These would include, but not limited to, factors such the number of charges taken into consideration, the lack of remorse, timeous plea of guilt, or the presence of a mental disorder or intellectual disability on the part of the accused. (See _GBR_ at \[39\]).

12     The Prosecution submitted that, based on the factual matrix of the case, this case come within the lower end of Band 2 of the _GBR_ sentencing framework. The Prosecution highlighted two aggravating factors, namely, the intrusion of the private parts of the victim (_i.e._ rubbing of the victim’s vagina) and the abuse of trust as the Accused was known to the victim as her grandaunt’s boyfriend. On this analysis, the Prosecution sought an imprisonment term of at least 18 months and caning of 3 strokes of the cane.

13     The Accused was 58 years old at the time of the commission of the offence. He was 60 years when he pleaded guilty and was convicted of the offence. The Accused is statutorily exempt from caning because of his age. The Prosecution thus sought an imprisonment term of two months in lieu of caning under s 325(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”). The Prosecution submitted that the need for retribution and deterrence warranted the imposition of the additional imprisonment term. The Prosecution referred this court to the High Court’s decision in _Amin bin Abdullah v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 904</span> a \[90\] for its calibration of the additional imprisonment term.

### Enhanced Sentencing under Section 50T(1)(a) Prisons Act

14     On the issue of enhanced sentencing under s 50T(1)(_a_) of the Prisons Act, the Prosecution sought an imprisonment term of 129 days. The Prosecution adopted the following approach in arriving at 129 days.

15     The Prosecution first determined the level of culpability of the Accused in re-offending and then put his case within a “sentencing band” table which I have reproduced below.

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="12.82%"> <col width="58.98%"> <col width="28.2%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Band</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Sentence Range (computed as a fraction of the maximum period of enhanced sentence permissible, which is 578 days for the present case)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Level of culpability</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">One day’s imprisonment to one-third of maximum period</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Low severity</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">One-third to two-third of maximum period</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Moderate severity</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Two-third to maximum period</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">High severity</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

16     Having regard to the fact that the s 354(2) PC offence is of a different nature than the offence of Consumption of a Specified Drug for which the Accused received the remission order, the Prosecution put the breach of the remission order in Band 1 of the above table. At this stage of their analysis, the Prosecution submitted that the appropriate enhanced sentence should be up to 193 days’ imprisonment (_i.e._ one-third of the maximum of 578 days, with a rounding off upwards to a full day).

17     In the next step of their analysis, the Prosecution submitted that having regard to the fact that the Accused has pleaded guilty, a further one-third discount on 193 days is appropriate, resulting in 129 days of imprisonment for enhanced sentencing.

18     In summary, the ultimate sentence that the Prosecution sought in this case was 20 months and 129 days of imprisonment.

## Mitigation Plea

19     The Accused did not address the court on sentence. He merely informed the court that he has discovered that he has hypertension while being remanded in prison. The Accused asked for leniency in sentencing. He also asked for the commencement of his sentence of imprisonment to be backdated to the date of his remand which was established to be 25 June 2020.

## Court’s Sentencing Decision

### Outrage of Modesty punishable under s 354(2) PC

20     In my deliberation on the appropriate sentence for the s 354(2) offence, I followed the sentencing framework in _GBR_. At Step 1, the Prosecution has correctly identified two offence-specific aggravating factors (see \[12\] above). I would add that there was premeditation on the part of the Accused. The SOF revealed that he has a plan, and has executed that plan, to lure the Victim to a secluded place. I was also mindful of the harm suffered by the Victim as a result of the Accused’s criminal act (see SOF at \[13\]). I was therefore in agreement with the Prosecution that this case came within Band 2 of _GBR’s_ sentencing framework.

21     At Step 2, I agreed with the Prosecution that the indicative starting sentence within _GBR’s_ Band 2 is an imprisonment term of 18 months and 3 strokes of the cane : see _GBR_ at \[33\].

22     At Step 3, I considered the TIC charge and the Accused’s criminal history and weighed them against his plea of guilt. In my assessment, these factors balanced out evenly. As such, I did not alter the indicative starting sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane.

23     Due to the Accused’s age, he is exempt from caning. The issue I have to consider at this stage was whether the sentence should be enhanced by way of the imposition of imprisonment term in lieu of caning. In _GBR_ at \[40\], the High Court held :

> 40    … In an offence of In an offence such as outrage of modesty, an imprisonment term in lieu of caning may be appropriate where there is the need for a sufficiently deterrent and retributive sentence (see _PP v Tan Kok Leong_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 188</span> (“_Tan Kok Leong_”) at \[91\], cited in _Amin bin Abdullah_ at \[73\]), for example, if there are substantial aggravating factors such as violence used or an exploitation of a particularly vulnerable class of victims.

24     I found that the Accused has clearly exploited a young and vulnerable victim. I also agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that there was a need for a sufficiently deterrent and retributive sentence. I therefore imposed an imprisonment term of 2 months in lieu of the 3 strokes of caning pursuant to s 325(2) CPC.

25     In summary, the sentence meted out on the Accused for the s 354(2) offence was 20 months’ imprisonment.

### Enhanced Sentencing under Section 50T(1)(a) Prisons Act

26     In the present case, while I agreed with the Prosecution that enhanced sentencing ought to be imposed, I did not agree with the “sentencing band” approach proposed by the Prosecution.

27     I have decided not to adopt the Prosecution “sentencing band” approach for the following reasons:

> (a)     The Prosecution did not provide any explanation how its proposal was derived.

> (b)     No case authority or precedent was cited in support of the proposal.

> (c)     I was mindful of the caution stated by the Court of Appeal (“CA”) in _Adri Anton Kalangie v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 2 SLR 557</span> at \[67\] where the CA stated : “\[r\]elatedly, since the court establishing a new sentencing framework will likely be an appellate court, the doctrine of prospective overruling will likewise most likely arise for consideration by an appellate court. … It would probably be a rare case where a first instance court, whether the High Court sitting in its original criminal jurisdiction or a State Court, has to calibrate a sentencing framework for the first time and must therefore consider the prospectivity of the framework laid down. Such a situation should generally be avoided.” I heeded the CA’s advice.

28     In my judgment, the Prosecution’s submission for the imposition of 129 days of enhanced sentence clearly diluted the effectiveness and deterrent value of the original sentence of five years’ imprisonment. It would be a lenient exercise of a court’s sentencing power. In this regard, I have relied on the speech of Mr Masagos Zulkifli, Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (as he then was), made during the parliamentary debate on the introduction of the Conditional Release System (“CRS”) and the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme (“MAS”) in the Prisons (Amendment) Bill on 20 January 2014. He said :

> “Currently, inmates are granted one-third remission for god conduct and behaviour in prison, that is, if they have not breached prison discipline. There are no conditions imposed on their release. In contrast, many jurisdictions have moved away from their colonial precedents. The UK and its former colonies like Canada, New Zealand, and Hong Kong have, over time, implemented parole or conditional release systems that impose conditions on inmates when they are released. This creates the incentive for good behaviour upon release…

> The CRS seeks to deter ex-inmates from re-offending by subjecting them to conditions upon their release. All inmates will be subject to the CRS upon release.

> …

> However, at the end of the day, even with the additional support and aftercare provided to the ex-offender, it is ultimately the responsibility of the individual not to reoffend. If he does, he will be dealt with swiftly and strictly by the law. _(Emphasis added)._

29     In sentencing the Accused under s 50T(1)(_a_) Prisons Act, I considered the statutory requirements set out in s 50(T)(3) Prisons Act which provides :

> (3)    In deciding whether to impose any enhanced sentence under subsection (1) or (2) with respect to any offence, and if so the length of the enhanced sentence, the court shall consider —

>> (_a_)    the gravity of the offence;

>> (_b_)    whether the offence is of a similar nature to the offence for which the person under a remission order was originally sentenced;

>> (_c_)    the length of time for which the person did not commit any offence after being released under that remission order; and

>> (_d_)    all other relevant circumstances

30     There is no dispute that the offence of Aggravated Outrage of Modesty under s 354(2) PC is a serious one for it carries a sentence of imprisonment for a term which may extend to 5 years, or with fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishment.

31     There is also no dispute that the offence of Aggravated Outrage of Modesty under s 354(2) PC was not of a similar nature to the offence of Consumption of a Specified Drug for which he was originally sentenced. From his criminal antecedents, I have observed that Accused has added sexual offence to his previous criminal activities.

32     The Accused was released on 31 May 2018 and he reoffended in June 2018. I have noticed that the exact date of the commission of the offence was not stated on the charge. It appeared to the court that a benefit of doubt was exercised in favour of the Accused by computing the period of enhanced sentencing from 30 June 2018.

33     The only relevant mitigating factor in favour of the Accused was his plea of guilt. If the matter has proceeded to trial, I believe the Prosecution would have to adduce evidence of the Accused’s last conviction. This will then be followed by adducing the remission order through a representative from the Prisons, and for the representative to explain how the enhanced sentencing period was derived. In view of the Accused’s plea of guilt, there was some saving in public resources and time.

34     I think it would be fair to say that, based on the factual matrix of the present case, the factors in s 50T(3)(_a_) and (_c_) were the weightier factors justifying the imposition of a significant period of enhanced sentencing. In this instance, my assessment was 70% of the enhanced sentencing period. The dissimilarity of the s 354(2) PC offences to his drugs antecedent was a neutral factor because of the first factor _i.e._ gravity of the s 354(2) PC offence. However, in choosing to commit a dissimilar but heinous offence against a familial minor shortly after his release from prison, his conduct evidenced a failure to commit to a crime-free life post release.

35     As such deterrence takes centre stage, warranting the Accused to serve an indicative imprisonment term of 400 days. There were no other aggravating factors as he had pleaded guilty to avoid wasting public resources and time. In the final analysis, the 400 days of imprisonment for enhanced sentencing under s 50T(1)(_a_) Prisons Act required no further moderation.

### Conclusion

36     In conclusion, the final sentence meted out for the present case is an imprisonment term of 20 months and 400 days.
