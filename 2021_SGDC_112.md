Civil Procedure – Interrogatories

Courts and Jurisdiction – Judicial precedent – Stare decisis

17 June 2021 - Judgment reserved.

### Deputy Registrar Teo Wei Ling:

## Introduction

1       This is an application (the “Application”) by the defendant (“Hansfort”) under Order 26 rule 3(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap. 322, r 5, Rev. Ed. 2014) (“Rules of Court”) for the withdrawal of interrogatories served by the plaintiff (“COMPASS”) without order under Order 26 rules 1(1) and 3 of the Rules of Court.

2       This case involves an interesting point of law pertaining to the issue of judicial precedent: namely, whether decisions of Assistant Registrars (“ARs”) are binding upon Deputy Registrars (“DRs”) through _stare decisis_.

3       I reserved judgment following the hearing of the Application, and now furnish my decision.

## Background

4       COMPASS is a Singapore-incorporated company, and claims to be a collecting society representing owners of musical works (“Represented Owners) comprised in international and local repertoires. Hansfort is the sole proprietor of Filmgarde, a cinema operator. Hansfort (through Filmgarde) operates various Filmgarde cinemas.

5       According to COMPASS, it owns the right to, among other things, license the performing rights in musical works of the Represented Owners in Singapore, collect royalties, and enforce infringements of their performing rights on their behalf. Among other things, COMPASS operates a Blanket License Scheme for cinema operators, customarily pegged at 0.2% of Gross Box Office receipts.

6       On 31 May 2019, COMPASS brought the present action in the District Court against Hansfort for alleged infringement of copyright. COMPASS claimed that since 27 December 2014, Hansfort has infringed the copyright in the musical works of the Represented Owners by screening films which contained musical works under COMPASS’s purview, without first obtaining a licence from COMPASS.

7       At Schedule 2 to its statement of claim, COMPASS also set out a non-exhaustive list of films screened and/or exhibited by Hansfort between April 2016 and December 2017 (the “Schedule 2 Films”), which COMPASS alleged contained, comprised and/or featured musical works of the Represented Owners. It is undisputed that COMPASS relied on three letters that Hansfort sent to COMPASS prior to the proceedings, dated 12 July 2016, 11 January 2017 and 6 November 2017 (“Hansfort’s Letters”), to identify and particularise the Schedule 2 Films.

8       Hansfort denied that it has committed any copyright infringement, or that COMPASS is the owner of, or representative of the Represented Owners of all the rights in all musical works listed in the Statement of Claim. Hansfort further alleged that it had legitimately acquired the rights directly from the respective distributors of the films screened in all Filmgarde cinemas to exhibit these films in public.

9       On 8 December 2020, COMPASS served a list of six interrogatories (“Interrogatories”) on Hansfort, as follows:

> (A)    With reference to the letters disclosed at S/No. 16, 18 and 19 of the Defendant’s List of Documents dated 13 November 2020 (collectively, the “Hansfort’s Letters”) and the cinematographic films referred to by Hansfort (i.e. the Defendant) in the Hansfort’s Letters therein:-

>> 1.    Did Hansfort receive any music Cue Sheet Report(s) for any of the cinematographic films referred to in the Hansfort’s Letters?

>> 2.    If yes to Interrogatory 1, please identify:

>>> a.    Each of the cinematographic films for which Hansfort received a music Cue Sheet Report;

>>> b.    When Hansfort received the relevant music Cue Sheet Report(s); and

>>> c.    The party who provided Hansfort with the relevant music Cue Sheet Report(s).

> (B)    With reference to paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Statement of Claim dated 31 May 2019 (the “SOC”), Schedule 2 of the SOC, and the Hansfort’s Letters:-

>> 3.    Since on or about 27 December 2014 to the commencement of the proceedings herein on 31 May 2019, did Hansfort cause and/or allow the screening and/or exhibition of any cinematographic films other than the cinematographic films set out in Schedule 2 of the SOC?

>> 4.    If yes to Interrogatory 3, please identify each of the cinematographic films.

>> 5.    Did Hansfort receive any music Cue Sheet Report(s) for any of the cinematographic films identified in relation to Interrogatory 4?

>> 6.    If yes to Interrogatory 5, please identify:

>>> a.    Each of the cinematographic films for which Hansfort received a music Cue Sheet Report;

>>> b.    When Hansfort received the relevant music Cue Sheet Report(s); and

>>> c.    The party who provided Hansfort with the relevant music Cue Sheet Report(s).

10     Two of the Interrogatories (namely, paragraphs 3 and 4) related to films that Hansfort screened and/or exhibited since 27 December 2014 to date excluding the Schedule 2 Films (the “Films Interrogatories”). The remaining four (namely, paragraphs 1, 2, 5 and 6) related to music cue sheet reports in respect of all the films Hansfort screened and/or exhibited since 27 December 2014 to date (the “Cue Sheet Interrogatories”).

11     On 13 January 2021, Hansfort filed the Application, seeking an order that the Interrogatories be withdrawn.

## Parties’ arguments

12     The general principles governing interrogatories as recently summarised in _Prudential Assurance Co Singapore Pte Ltd v Tan Shou Yi Peter_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHCR 4</span> (“_Prudential Assurance”_) are well-settled and undisputed between the parties. The dispute focused on whether the Interrogatories were relevant and necessary, and whether the decision of an AR in a similar application for the withdrawal of interrogatories can be distinguished or is binding as a matter of _stare decisis_.

13     COMPASS submitted that the Interrogatories were relevant and necessary as the Interrogatories seek to crystallise all of Hansfort’s acts of copyright infringement. In this regard:

> (a)     COMPASS stated that it could not fully particularise each and every act of copyright infringement committed by Hansfort from December 2014 to date (save for the period of the Schedule 2 Films) because it was not provided with information as to the films screened and/or exhibited by Hansfort during the same period. It submitted that the Films Interrogatories are thus meant to plug this gap, so that COMPASS can seek damages for the whole extent of Hansfort’s copyright infringement. COMPASS further argued that this information was within the knowledge of Hansfort only, and without the answers to the Films Interrogatories, COMPASS would not know the full extent of the copyright infringement allegedly committed by Hansfort.

> (b)     As for the Cue Sheet Interrogatories, COMPASS submitted that they were relevant to paragraph 16 of Hansfort’s defence, where Hansgort alleged it had legitimately acquired the rights from the respective distributors to exhibit films in public. In this regard, counsel for COMPASS argued in submissions that in order for Hansfort to know what rights it has acquired from the respective distributors, it ought to have received cue sheet reports, which allegedly would set out all the musical works featured in a film, the authors of the works, as well as the society representing those authors. COMPASS also argued that the Cue Sheet Interrogatories are necessary so it can avoid being caught by surprise if Hansofrt claims atHansfort claims at trial that it had legitimately acquired rights from distributors by way of oral agreements.

14     In addition, COMPASS submitted that the Interrogatories would assist in disposing fairly of the action and saving costs, since, among other things, the Interrogatories would allow COMPASS to obtain information directly relevant and material to its claim, would form a step in establishing liability against Hansfort, would delineate the scope of the process of discovery, would save time at trial, and could be easily answered by Hansfort. On the other hand, it claimed that if the Interrogatories are not allowed, serious prejudice would be occasioned to COMPASS.

15     COMPASS further submitted that it had successfully resisted an application for withdrawal of interrogatories in a similar copyright infringement suit filed in the High Court in HC/S 1292/2018 (“Suit 1292”) against another cinema operator, EW Cinema Pte Ltd (“EW”). COMPASS had served on EW interrogatories identical to this Application, EW then applied to withdraw the interrogatories (“EW’s Application”), but EW’s Application was dismissed by the learned AR (the “AR’s Order”). COMPASS argued that EW’s Application cannot be distinguished from the present Application, and contended that by the principle of _stare decisis_, the AR’s Order is binding on DRs of the State Courts.

16     Hansfort, in response, argued that the Interrogatories ought to be withdrawn, for three main reasons:

> (a)     First, the Films Interrogatories are an attempt to fish for information because COMPASS does not know the scope of the films for which it is bringing its claim of alleged copyright infringement, and is trying to stumble upon information to support its case. In order for COMPASS to claim that Hansfort had infringed the copyright in the Represented Owners’ musical works, COMPASS ought to know which musical works fall under COMPASS’s purview, the films which featured such musical works, and the relevant films that Hansfort exhibited. In any event, information as to the movies that a cinema is screening is publicly available information.

> (b)     Second, both categories of Interrogatories are irrelevant and unnecessary as they do not have a bearing on the key issue of whether COMPASS owns the performance rights in the relevant musical works that were contained in films screened and/or exhibited by Hansfort. COMPASS should not require Hansfort to provide a list of movies screened in order to prove that it owns the relevant performance rights. Further, whether or not Hansfort received cue sheet reports as well as when and from whom Hansfort received cue sheet reports, would not affect the issue of COMPASS’s alleged ownership in copyright. Therefore, the Interrogatories are unnecessary to the disposal of any issues at trial and would not lead to costs savings.

> (c)     Third, the nature of the Interrogatories sought is extensive and oppressive. Hansfort would have to trawl through over two and a half years’ worth of records and documents to answer the Interrogatories, and this would not lead to any costs savings. The burden imposed on Hansfort to answer the Interrogatories would be disproportionate to the benefit gained since they do not go towards the disposal of the key issue in this suit, being COMPASS’s alleged ownership in copyright.

17     Hansfort further submitted that the AR’s Order could be distinguished from the present Application and is not binding. Even if the AR’s Order could not be distinguished, Hansfort submitted that there is no vertical _stare decisis_ between decisions of ARs and DRs, and accordingly, the AR’s Order is not binding on DRs.

## Issues to be determined

18     Three questions arise for consideration in the present Application:

> (a)     Can the AR’s Order be distinguished from the Application?

> (b)     If not, are decisions of ARs binding on DRs under the doctrine of vertical _stare decisis_?

> (c)     Are the Interrogatories relevant or necessary?

19     I deal with each of the issues in turn.

## Issue 1: Can the AR’s Order be distinguished from the Application?

20     COMPASS’s position is that the present action and Suit 1292 are similar copyright infringement proceedings, and the interrogatories served in both actions were similar in nature, therefore, the AR’s Order cannot be distinguished.

21     Having reviewed the pleadings and interrogatories served in Suit 1292, as well as the notes of evidence for the hearings of EW’s Application on 26 July 2019 and 13 August 2019 (“NEs”), I agree that COMPASS’s claims in both actions are of a similar nature, and the structure and contents of the statement of claim in both actions appear to be largely similar. Further, the interrogatories served in both suits are identical, except for the references to the respective defendants and the relevant time period of the alleged copyright infringements.

22     Hansfort submitted that the AR’s Order can be distinguished from the present Application because Hansfort took a different position from EW, namely, Hansfort argued in this Application that COMPASS is fishing for information because it does not even know the precise scope of its claim, whereas EW had argued in Suit 1292 that the interrogatories were an attempt to fish for information that may be of commercial interest to COMPASS but was otherwise not relevant to Suit 1292.

23     Hansfort further submitted that the AR’s Order can be distinguished because EW had voluntarily answered paragraphs 1 and 2 of the interrogatories. In this regard, Hansfort argued that the two applications are different in scope, that EW’s arguments on the relevance and materiality of paragraphs 3 to 6 of the interrogatories were undermined by its voluntary answer of paragraphs 1 and 2, and that the present Application can be distinguished because COMPASS relied on different reasonings in the two applications when arguing that paragraphs 1 and 2 of the interrogatories are relevant and necessary.

24     I am not convinced that the AR’s Order can be distinguished from this Application. It is clear from the NEs that EW had argued that service of the interrogatories was “_a classic case of fishing_”, and “_the Plaintiff ha\[d\] not identified which works they claimed \[EW Cinema\] ha\[d\] infringed_”. Further, in the AR’s Order, the learned AR expressly held that the interrogatories “_would allow the plaintiff to know and assess the full extent of the copyright infringement_”, and that “_\[w\]ithout the interrogatories, the Plaintiff would not be able to fully particularise each and every act of copyright infringement committed by the Defendant_”. It therefore appears that the learned AR had considered the argument that COMPASS does not know the scope of its claim for copyright infringement when making the AR’s Order.

25     Further, the brief oral grounds in the AR’s Order show that the learned AR had considered the relevance and necessity of paragraphs 3 to 6 of the interrogatories served on EW. The learned AR did not rely on EW’s voluntary answer of paragraphs 1 and 2 as the basis for finding that the remaining interrogatories were relevant or necessary, or that EW’s voluntary answer undermined its arguments in respect of the remaining interrogatories. Further, I disagree that COMPASS relied on different reasonings in both applications in respect of paragraphs 1 and 2 of the interrogatories. Rather, I find that COMPASS had argued in both applications that the paragraphs 1 and 2 interrogatories were necessary for it to particularise its claim, and the learned AR agreed with this submission and found in COMPASS’s favour. In my view, the AR’s Order cannot be distinguished from the Application.

## Issue 2: Vertical _Stare Decisis_ between ARs and DRs

26     Consequentially, I now turn to consider whether decisions of ARs are binding on DRs, such that the AR’s Order is binding on me.

27     The doctrine of vertical _stare decisis_ simply means that a judge is constrained to follow a decision of the courts above him in the judicial hierarchy if the case before him cannot be distinguished from the prior case (see Walter Woon, “The Doctrine of Judicial Precedent” in _The Singapore Legal System_ (Kevin YL Tan ed) (Singapore University Press, 1999) (“**_Woon_**”) at 298; _Peter Low LLC v Higgins, Danial Patrick_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHCR 18</span> (“**_Peter Low_**”)).

28     COMPASS submitted that vertical _stare decisis_ applies between ARs and DRs, so decisions of ARs are binding on DRs, and argued:

> (a)     ARs exercise delegated jurisdiction which is devolved from that vested in a High Court judge in chambers, and are delegated such powers, authority and jurisdiction as a matter of administrative convenience in a bid to save the time of the judge (citing Order 32 Rule 9(1) of the Rules of Court, Section 62 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap. 322, Rev. Ed. 2007) (“SCJA”) and _Tan Boon Heng v Lau Pang Cheng David_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 4 SLR 718</span> (“**_Tan Boon Heng_**”)).

> (b)     Therefore, a decision of an AR is a “good and binding decision of the High Court”. In this regard, COMPASS relied on _Actis Excalibur Ltd v KS Distribution Pte Ltd and other_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHCR 11</span> (“**_Actis Excalibur_**”) where the learned AR held (at \[20\]):

>> … In my opinion, a judicial decision of an AR, unless and until overruled by a High Court Judge (or any person qualified under the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1999 Rev Ed) to discharge the functions of a High Court Judge), must certainly stand as a good and binding decision of the High Court. Otherwise, the clear legislative premise upon which ARs are conferred the powers, authority and jurisdiction to carry out certain judicial functions on behalf of High Court Judges would be gravely undermined.

> (c)     Finally, that it is undisputed that the judicial hierarchy is such that decisions of the Court of Appeal bind the High Court, and decisions of the High Court bind the State Courts. Accordingly, since decisions of ARs are decisions of the High Court, they bind the State Courts.

29     On the other hand, Hansfort submitted that a key consideration in determining whether DRs are bound by decisions of ARs through vertical _stare decisis_ is whether a decision of a DR may be appealed to an AR. Since there is no right of appeal from decisions of a DR to an AR, vertical _stare decisis_ does not apply between ARs and DRs. In making this argument, Hansfort relied on the following authorities:

> (a)     First, the learned author in _Woon_ (at 306) stated that vertical _stare decisis_ follows from the power of a court to reverse the decision of a lower court. If there is a right of appeal from court A to court B, then court A should treat court B’s decisions as binding. Otherwise, if court A departs from such decisions it is likely to be reversed on appeal. Thus, a court should be bound by the decisions of a court to which appeals lie.

> (b)     Second, the learned AR in _Peter Low_ cited three reasons in reaching his decision that ARs are bound through vertical _stare decisis_ by decisions of High Court judges: (i) that all decisions of ARs are appealable to a High Court judge in chambers as of right, and the right of appeal is indicative of the existence of vertical _stare decisis_, (ii) that High Court judges have an unfettered standard of review when hearing appeals from decisions of ARs, and High Court judges need not consider how the AR exercised his or her discretion, and (iii) ARs are not coordinate with High Court judges in the judicial hierarchy (_Peter Low_ at \[27\], \[29\] and \[30\]).

> (c)     The learned AR in _Peter Low_ also cited with approval (at \[28\]) the High Court of Australia’s decision in _Viro v R_ (1978) 18 ALR 257, where Barwick CJ explained that “\[t\]he essential basis for the observance of a decision of a tribunal by way of binding precedent is that that tribunal can correct the decisions of the court which it is said so to be bound” (at 260), and Stephen J stated that “\[t\]he sanction implicit in the doctrine of precedent is simple and effective: if an inferior court fails to observe the doctrine the superior court will correct its decision on appeal. Thus the existence of an appeal is inherent in and essential to the doctrine” (at 289).

30     Hansfort further submitted that the reasons cited by the learned AR in _Peter Low_ to find vertical _stare decisis_ examine whether there exists a right of appeal over another court’s decision as the connective element between courts bound by vertical _stare decisis_.

31     In the present analysis, it cannot be disputed that there is no right of appeal from a DR to an AR, and a decision of a DR may only be appealed to a District Judge in Chambers under Order 55B rule 1(1) of the Rules of Court. Hansfort submitted that, accordingly, given that ARs exercise neither appellate nor confirmatory jurisdiction over decisions of DRs and have no practical ability to overturn decisions of DRs, DRs are not bound by decisions of ARs through vertical _stare decisis._

32     Having considered parties’ submissions, I am not persuaded by COMPASS’s argument that decisions of ARs stand as good and binding decisions of the High Court or are on equal standing with decisions of the High Court unless overruled. In my view, the argument that decisions of ARs are like those of a High Court judge in chambers because ARs exercise delegated power and jurisdiction is untenable. This is because decisions by ARs are appealable to a High Court judge in chambers. This alone makes clear that decisions of ARs do not have the same standing as that of a High Court judge in chambers, and suffices to dispose of the argument that decisions of ARs are coordinate with those of a High Court judge in chambers.

33     In essence, the argument for decisions of ARs to be binding on DRs rests on the fact that it is a decision that emanates from the High Court, and is therefore a decision of the High Court which binds lower courts. However, this proposition gives rise to a number of legal issues which, in my view, cannot be resolved satisfactorily:

> (a)     First, insofar as COMPASS’s argument is premised on ARs exercising delegated jurisdiction of High Court judges, then it would stand to reason that ARs themselves are not bound by High Court judges’ decisions, but this is clearly not the case (see _Peter Low_, _Actis Excalibur_).

> (b)     Second, the General Division of the High Court is not the only place where ARs exercise delegated jurisdiction; this also occurs at the Appellate Division of the High Court and the Court of Appeal in certain circumstances relating to directions and incidental orders. An example would be where ARs give directions or orders pursuant to Order 56A rule 18 and Order 57 rule 16A of the Rules of Court, exercising the delegated powers of the Appellate Division of the High Court or Court of Appeal. If COMPASS’s position is correct, that would mean that decisions of ARs exercising the delegated powers of the Appellate Division of the High Court and Court of Appeal would stand as good and binding decisions of the Appellate Division of the High Court and Court of Appeal, which would be binding on High Court judges sitting in the General Division of the High Court. This would be a curious outcome.

34     In the circumstances, I am of the view that the position and analysis proffered by Hansfort is to be preferred, namely, that the doctrine of vertical _stare decisis_ does not prevail between ARs and DRs. Since the doctrine flows from the power of a court to reverse the decision of a lower court, it would not make sense for an AR’s decision to be binding on the State Courts (whether the decision is made by a District Judge, Magistrate or Deputy Registrar) since an AR would not hear an appeal from the State Courts. This position also obviates the difficulty of decisions by ARs in the Appellate Division of the High Court and Court of Appeal potentially being binding on High Court judges sitting in the General Division. There is also nothing inherent in the doctrine of _stare decisis_ which rigidly demands that the exercise of delegated jurisdiction by an AR in the High Court be binding on the State Courts.

35     This approach would also be consistent with the position taken by the High Court of England and Wales in the case of _Coral Reef Ltd v Silverbond Enterprises Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 WLR 104</span>. This involved an appeal from a High Court master to a High Court judge, and concerned the issue of whether decisions of High Court judges were binding on High Court masters. To put this in context, the English civil court system is divided between the County Court, which deals with claims of a low value, and the High Court, which deals with claims with a value of over £100,000. The role of a master in the High Court is similar to that of an AR in Singapore, in that they are judicial officers who exercise jurisdiction in civil matters, and at first instance deal with all aspects of a claim from its issue until it is ready for trial. In this case, the master had at first instance held that he was not bound by decisions of High Court judges because, in exercising the jurisdiction of the High Court, his decision was coordinate with that of a High Court judge. On appeal, David Foxton _QC_ (sitting as a deputy High Court judge in the Chancery Division of the High Court of England and Wales) disagreed with the master’s view. One of the reasons stated in support of his conclusion was that if the decisions of masters were treated as those of coordinate jurisdiction of High Court judges, “it would mean that decisions of masters would be binding on county court judges as a matter of precedent” (at \[64\]). This suggests that Foxton _QC_ did not consider the decisions of masters binding on the county courts.

36     For all these reasons, I am of the view that the doctrine of vertical _stare decisis_ does not prevail between ARs and DRs, and find that the AR’s Order is not binding on me.

## Issue 3: Are the Interrogatories relevant or necessary?

37     Having concluded that the AR’s Order is not binding on me, I now consider whether the Interrogatories are relevant and necessary.

38     Under Order 26 rule 1 of the Rules of Court, interrogatories may be served if they are relevant and necessary in order to dispose fairly of the cause or matter, or for saving costs. The instances where interrogatories may be allowed or refused have been summarised in _Prudential Assurance_ (at \[13\] and \[14\]), of which the following are of particular relevance to this Application:

> (a)     interrogatories are more readily allowed where they have a direct bearing on the issues in dispute, delineate the precise matters in contention, can potentially dispose of entire lines of questioning, and can be answered without difficulty; and

> (b)     interrogatories are more readily refused if they are oppressive in nature, in that they exceed the legitimate requirements of the circumstances at hand, or impose a burden on the interrogated party that is entirely disproportionate to the benefit to be gained by the interrogating party, or if they seek mere evidence which does not form any part of the material facts in dispute.

#### Films Interrogatories

39     I turn first to the Films Interrogatories, which queries whether Hansfort has screened and/or exhibited any other films apart from the Schedule 2 Films, and if so, to identify such films. Both parties’ submissions as to the relevance and necessity of the Films Interrogatories have been set out at paragraphs 13 to 16 above and I do not propose to repeat the same here.

40     Having considered the arguments on both sides, I find that the Films Interrogatories are relevant and necessary for the fair disposal of the matter, for the following reasons:

> (a)     First, the Films Interrogatories have a direct connection to the issues in dispute. It is clear from the statement of claim that COMPASS’s case is that Hansfort has committed acts of copyright infringement since 27 December 2014 to date. The Films Interrogatories would allow COMPASS to fully particularise each and every act of copyright infringement committed by Hansfort in this period, since COMPASS does not have this information which is in the sole custody of Hansfort.

> (b)     Second, on the issue of custody, I disagree with Hansfort’s argument that the answers to the Films Interrogatories, namely the list of films that were screened since 27 December 2014 to date, are publicly available information since any member of the public can easily find out the movies that a cinema is screening by checking online. While I accept that movie listings may be set out on cinema operator’s websites which are publicly available, such websites usually state only movies and films that are presently being screened or movies and films that will be screened in the future. The websites are not likely to state what films and movies had been screened several months or even years ago. Even if it was possible to find this information, no evidence was provided about what websites would list the films that have been screened by a cinema operator. I also reject Hansfort’s argument that it is “likely” COMPASS would have already obtained the list of films exhibited by Hansfort before commencing the present claim”. If COMPASS had obtained the list of films, it would not have to request for the Films Interrogatories. Hansfort further submitted it would be “fair to presume” that COMPASS should already have known what movies Hansfort was screening, but this is a presumption and there is no documentary proof to substantiate this presumption.

> (c)     Third, the answers to the Films Interrogatories would allow COMPASS to know and assess the full extent of copyright infringement for the relevant period, and would clarify the scope of the alleged copyright infringement. I also agree with COMPASS’s argument that the context of this Application is similar to that in _Trek Technology (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Ritronics Components (S’pore) Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 1 SLR(R) 846</span>, where the High Court found (at \[8\]):

>> If, as in this case, a defendant is accused of infringing the plaintiff’s patent rights to a “thumb drive” storage disk, then the plaintiff must prove that he had the patent rights and that the defendant had made thumb drives using the plaintiff’s design. The existence of the latter event may seem to be incontrovertible in many cases since the defendant would generally derive no profit from his infringing activity unless and until he sells the impugned thumb drives in the open market. The plaintiff, however, may face insurmountable difficulties of proof since he may never know when the defendant first started making the said product or when he started selling them, or where he sold them, and how many had been sold. Such questions would be relevant, and in fact central, to any attempt to assess the extent of damage suffered by the plaintiff. They would thus necessarily constitute issues during the trial, but to leave them only to be addressed during cross-examination may prove a long and painfully futile exercise because the cross-examination is one of the penultimate parts of the trial process, being the stage just before counsel’s closing address to the court. The introduction of such central pieces of information at this late stage may often catch opposing counsel unaware and create the need for adjournments and a flurry of interlocutory applications to allow opposing counsel to address these new developments…

> (d)     For the foregoing reasons, I am of the view that the Films Interrogatories would be relevant and necessary to allow COMPASS to assess the extent of damage it has suffered as a result of Hansfort’s alleged acts of copyright infringement, and is not a fishing expedition. Further, having the answers to the Films Interrogatories at this stage would be beneficial as it would help parties prepare the case they have to meet, and no one would be taken by surprise if this information came out at trial.

#### Cue Sheet Interrogatories

41     In contrast, I do not think that the Cue Sheet Interrogatories are relevant or necessary for the fair disposal of the matter or the saving of costs.

42     First, it is not apparent on the face of the Cue Sheet Interrogatories that they relate to paragraph 16 of Hansfort’s defence, especially since paragraph 16 does not refer to either the Hansfort’s Letters or any music cue sheet reports at all. Counsel for COMPASS submitted that they are relevant because if Hansfort had acquired rights to screen the films, “one would have imagined that they obtained cue sheets before movies were screened”. This is speculative. It is not Hansfort’s position, whether in its pleadings or in the affidavits or submissions filed in this Application, that having cue sheets are how a party would obtain rights to screen films. COMPASS’s submission that cue sheet reports would show what rights a party would need to acquire in order to screen the film such that the two cannot be divorced from another, was also not stated on affidavit.

43     Crucially, however, when asked in the hearing to confirm whether COMPASS’s position is that, if Hansfort has relevant agreements with distributors (as it alleges) then Hansfort must necessarily have music cue sheet reports, counsel for COMPASS denied this and said the Cue Sheet Interrogatories are intended to ascertain this. To my mind, this undermines COMPASS’s argument that obtaining cue sheet reports would go towards showing whether Hansfort had acquired the rights to screen the relevant films.

44     Even if Hansfort were to provide information as to whether it had received music cue sheet reports for the movies it had screened, as well as when and from whom it received such reports, this would not address either the issue of whether COMPASS owns ownership of the copyright of musical works in the movies, or whether Hansfort has legitimately acquired rights from the relevant distributors.

45     COMPASS further submitted that Hansfort has not disclosed any documents to support its allegation that it had acquired rights from the distributors. As such, COMPASS submitted that the Cue Sheet Interrogatories are necessary to avoid being caught by surprise at trial if, for example, Hansfort claims at trial that it had legitimately acquired rights from distributors pursuant to oral agreements. I am not satisfied that the Cue Sheet Interrogatories would address this concern. The Cue Sheet Interrogatories do not ask whether or how Hansfort acquired rights from distributors. Even if Hansfort were to answer the Cue Sheet Interrogatories, any answers given do not preclude Hansfort from raising at the trial that it had entered into oral agreements with distributors to acquire the relevant rights. Further, counsel for COMPASS submitted that if Hansfort says it has cue sheet reports, then COMPASS would follow up with further interrogatories as to where, when, how and why Hansfort contracted with distributors to acquire rights to screen the relevant films. The fact that COMPASS intends to ask such follow up questions on the circumstances of how Hansfort allegedly acquired the relevant rights suggests that those are in fact the relevant and necessary questions, which relate directly to paragraph 16 of Hansfort’s defence, and the Cue Sheet Interrogatories are not necessary to delineate the matters in contention or save time and costs.

46     Finally, in light of my finding that the Cue Sheet Interrogatories do not have a direct bearing on the issues in dispute, answering the Cue Sheet Interrogatories would impose a burden on Hansfort that is disproportionate to any benefit to be gained by COMPASS. Requiring Hansfort to trawl through many years of records to answer the Cue Sheet Interrogatories, when any answer given would not resolve the issue of whether COMPASS has ownership of the copyright of musical works in the movies, or the issue of whether Hansfort has legitimately acquired rights from the relevant distributors, would not amount to any costs savings for parties. It appears to be an attempt to seek evidence that does not form any substantial part of the material facts in dispute.

47     The Cue Sheet Interrogatories therefore do not appear to be material to the case at hand, and would not dispose of the matter one way or another. It follows that the Cue Sheet Interrogatories are neither necessary for the fair disposal of the matter nor for saving costs. As such, I order that the Cue Sheet Interrogatories be withdrawn.

## Conclusion

48     For the foregoing reasons, I order that the Cue Sheet Interrogatories be withdrawn, but decline to so order in relation to the Films Interrogatories. I will hear parties on costs.
