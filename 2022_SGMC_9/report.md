25 January 2022

### Magistrate Hairul Hakkim:

## Introduction

1       I pen these grounds of decision to briefly clarify the following two sentencing principles in the context of offences involving threatening and distributing obscene material(s):

> (a)     first, for the offence of causing alarm to a victim by threatening to disseminate obscene materials involving the victim, where such materials had been procured by the accused without the consent of the victim, this would ordinarily be regarded as an aggravating factor; and

> (b)     second, for the offence of putting into circulation obscene material, the accused’s subsequent voluntary removal of the material from circulation would generally be a relevant mitigating factor.

## Charges

2       The accused, Danial Atan, pleaded guilty to the following two charges:

> (a)     for sending threatening messages to the victim (“Victim”) to leak obscene videos involving the Victim with the intent to cause alarm to him, and thereby causing him alarm under s 3(1)(_b_) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A, 2015 Rev Ed) (“POHA”), an offence punishable under s 3(2) of the POHA (the “POHA Charge”); and

> (b)     for putting obscene material into circulation under s 292(1)(_a_) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”) by uploading on social media a video clip depicting the Victim having sexual intercourse with the accused (the “Obscene Circulation Charge”).

3       The accused also consented to the following two charges to be taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing (the “TIC Charges”):

> (a)     for having in his possession 44 video files which are obscene under s 30(2)(_a_) of the Films Act (Cap 107, 1998 Rev Ed); and

> (b)     for knowingly gaining unauthorised access to the Victim’s social media account under s 3(1) of the Computer Misuse Act (Cap 50A, 2007 Rev Ed).

4       At the outset, I should highlight that the accused could not have been charged with offences for distributing and/or threatening to distribute intimate recordings under s 377BE of the Penal Code 1871 (2020 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code 1871”) as the offences were committed before the relevant operative date of 1 January 2020. Nevertheless, as I explain below, the sentencing principles elucidated in this case are likely to remain relevant to offences under s 377BE of the Penal Code 1871.

## Relevant facts

5       The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts dated 18 January 2022 (“SOF”) without any qualification. I reproduce the redacted salient facts from the SOF below.

6       The accused is a 29-year-old male Singaporean while the Victim is a 27-year-old male Singaporean. Sometime in September 2017, the accused and Victim started to become physically intimate with one another. This relationship continued until the end of 2018. Throughout this period, the accused took several videos of their sexual escapades. All the intimate videos were taken with the consent of the Victim.

7       On 3 January 2019, the Victim informed the accused that he wanted to end their relationship. Enraged, the accused sent multiple messages to the Victim, threatening to leak videos of their sexual activities. I reproduce below some of these messages in full (see SOF at \[6\]):

> a.    “IM GONNA SEND IT TO UR CHURCH FRIENDS” \[_sic_\]

> b.    “U HAVE 5MINS TO THINK ABT UR FUTURE IN UR TRASH CHURCH AND SAY U WILL PAY FOR UR FKING BETRAYAL” \[_sic_\]

> c.    “THE MOMENT I SHOW YOU THE PIC U WONT EVEN HAVE TIME TO TYPE” \[_sic_\]

> d.    “FLOAT ON TUMBLR LET UR ARMY PPL FIND OR UR CHURCH” \[_sic_\]

> e.    “LAST CHANCE…ONCE ITS OUT THERE U CANNOT CONTAIN IT…NOT EVEN ME” \[_sic_\]

8       Subsequently, on 24 April 2019, at about 6.30am, the accused posted one obscene video clip of the Victim and him engaging in sexual intercourse on the Victim’s Instagram account (“Instagram Account”). At the material time, the Instagram Account was a private account with about 80 followers. The accused then confronted the Victim at work and warned him that this was his “last chance to change his mind about ending the relationship” (see SOF at \[10\]).

9       The accused had obtained access to the Victim’s Instagram Account through one of the Victim’s email accounts. The accused thereafter linked his own email account and mobile number to the Instagram Account, and changed the password to the Instagram Account. The accused admitted that he did so to delay the Victim from accessing his Instagram Account and to prevent him from deleting the obscene video clip.

10     The obscene video had been viewed by one of the Victim’s friends as well as the Victim’s brother. The accused took down the video clip on the same day at around 12.22pm once he learned that the Victim’s brother had viewed it.

11     With the relevant facts set out, I turn now to explain the individual sentences I had imposed.

## Sentencing

### Sentence for POHA Charge

12     For the POHA Charge, the punishment prescribed under s 3(2) of the POHA is a fine not exceeding $5,000 or an imprisonment term not exceeding 6 months or both.

13     The Prosecution submitted for a sentence of at least 8 weeks’ imprisonment for the POHA Charge, while the Defence pleaded for a sentence between 4 to 6 weeks’ imprisonment. Both parties rightly acknowledged that there are no relevant sentencing benchmarks for this offence, save for one reported District Court decision in _Public Prosecutor v Mok Wai Lun Calvin_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 306</span> (“_Calvin Mok_”).

14     In _Calvin Mok_, the offender pleaded guilty to the same offence under s 3(2) of the POHA, wherein he had threatened to disseminate a nude photograph and other humiliating video clips taken of a 67-year-old female without her consent. In particular, the offender had threatened to destroy the victim’s reputation and ruin her career unless she paid him $100,000. He was convicted and sentenced to 13 weeks’ imprisonment. Both parties agreed that a downward revision from _Calvin Mok_ was warranted for the POHA Charge because the accused here did not intend to exploit the Victim for profit, unlike the offender in _Calvin Mok_.

15     Additionally, the Defence submitted that the facts in _Calvin Mok_ were more aggravated because the underlying materials had been obtained without the knowledge of the victim, unlike the present case where the Victim had consented to being filmed during their acts of private intimacy (see \[6\] above). In reply, the Prosecution disagreed, contending that the alarm caused to a victim would be the same regardless of whether the videos had been taken with or without the victim’s consent.

16     I agreed with the Defence’s submission. In my judgment, where an intimate image or recording was taken without the consent of the victim, this should ordinarily be regarded as an aggravating factor where an accused threatened to leak such intimate materials. Recording a victim without consent is a gross invasion of the victim’s privacy and would therefore be directly relevant to the culpability of the accused. Further, from the viewpoint of an offence under s 3(2) of the POHA, where the primary harm caused to a victim is, among other things, the causing of alarm (the same rationale is likely to apply for offences under s 377BE(2) of the Penal Code 1871), there is likely to be _greater_ alarm when a victim is threatened with the distribution of intimate recordings, which provenance the victim was entirely unaware of.

17     This interpretation was also supported by the decision in _Calvin Mok_ where the District Judge appeared to have considered the fact that the nude photograph and videos clips were taken without the victim’s consent as an aggravating factor (see _Calvin Mok_ at \[7(i)\]).

18     It is appropriate at this juncture to note that under the present legislative framework, where an intimate image or recording is captured without the victim’s consent, this would likely amount to an offence of voyeurism under s 377BB(5) of the Penal Code 1871. Even if the offender is not separately charged for this offence, this fact, if admitted to by the accused, may be considered by the court as a background fact that has sufficient nexus to the commission of an offence of threatening to distribute intimate image or recording under s 377BE(2) of the Penal Code 1871 (see \[4\] above; see also _Public Prosecutor v Suzanna Bong_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 2 SLR 1001</span> at \[64\]–\[66\], citing with approval the decision of the High Court in _Chua Siew Peng v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 1247</span> at \[81\]–\[83\]).

19     Notwithstanding the above, I was unable to agree with the Defence that a downward revision from the sentence of 13 weeks’ imprisonment imposed in _Calvin Mok_ to 4 to 6 weeks’ imprisonment was appropriate for the POHA Charge on account of the following considerations:

> (a)     Similar to the offender in _Calvin Mok_, the accused had threatened to disseminate obscene videos of the Victim to ruin his _reputation_ (see also _Calvin Mok_ at \[7(ii)\]). The accused’s threats were also premeditated and planned to cause the Victim as much alarm as possible. This much was evident from the explicit threats sent by the accused, which, among other things, included “\[I am going to\] send it \[_ie_, the obscene videos of the Victim\] to \[your\] church friends”, “\[You\] have 5 \[minutes\] to think \[about your\] future in \[your\] trash church”, and “Float on Tumblr \[and\] let \[your\] army \[people\] find or \[your\] church \[_sic_\]” (see \[7\] above)). The accused’s specific mention of the two social circles (_ie_, church and army) was likely because the Victim would be most alarmed should his army and church friends discover that he had engaged in homosexual activities.

> (b)     There was also clear persistence on the part of the accused. The initial threats, that are the subject matter of the POHA Charge, were issued on 3 January 2019. However, even up to three months later, the accused had continued to threaten the Victim, even noting that “this was the \[V\]ictim’s last chance to change his mind about ending the relationship” (see \[8\] above).

> (c)     Unlike the offender in _Calvin Mok_, the accused here had threatened to distribute intimate videos involving _sexual_ activities between the pair as opposed to only nude images and humiliating video clips (see _Calvin Mok_ at \[7(i)\]) – the former is clearly likely to cause greater alarm, especially in the present case where the facts are clear that the Victim had not been open with his church and army friends about having had a homosexual relationship.

> (d)     As for the sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment imposed in _Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Farid Bin Farus_ (MAC 902306/2015), I placed little weight on this decision as it is an unreported case (see _Public Prosecutor v Siow Kai Yuan Terence_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 4 SLR 1412</span> at \[86\] for the observation by Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon that unreported decisions carry limited precedential value).

20     Overall, considering the mitigating factors in this case (_ie_, the accused’s plea of guilt and cooperation with the authorities), I found that an imprisonment term of 8 weeks was appropriate in the circumstances of the case.

### Sentence for Obscene Circulation Charge

21     The punishment prescribed for the Obscene Circulation Charge under s 292(1) of the Penal Code is an imprisonment term not exceeding 3 months or a fine or both. Pertinently, it must be highlighted that Parliament has subsequently enhanced the punishment prescribed for distributing or threatening to distribute intimate image or recording by specifically enacting s 377BE of the Penal Code 1871, where the offence is punishable with an imprisonment term of up to 5 years with the possibility of caning as well. However, I was careful not to consider this new punishment regime in sentencing the accused, cognizant of the principle prohibiting retrospective application of criminal laws.

22     The Prosecution submitted for a sentence of at least 10 weeks’ imprisonment for the Obscene Circulation Charge while the Defence submitted for a sentence of between 8 to 10 weeks’ imprisonment.

23     From the parties’ submissions, one legal issue required closer consideration. The Defence submitted that the accused should be given credit for removing the video from the Instagram Account on the very same day. The Prosecution however submitted that this fact should carry no weight in relation to sentencing as the accused had already achieved what he wanted to do, _ie_, to embarrass the Victim.

24     On balance, I agreed with the submissions made by the Defence. From the perspective of the potential for harm caused by the offence, the risk of potential harm to the Victim was causally related to the length of time the video clip had been put into circulation by the accused.

25     Here, I note that the accused had _voluntarily_ removed the obscene video from the Instagram Account the very same day within about 6 hours after the video had been posted (see \[8\] and \[10\] above). This ought to be a mitigating factor in his favour. Even if the accused’s actions were not motivated by any genuine remorse, his removal of the video would have reduced the likelihood of other followers to the Instagram Account viewing the video clip and consequently the risk of _further_ dissemination. I therefore disagreed with the Prosecution that his removal of the video should be accorded no weight given that his subsequent conduct had a direct bearing on the potential for harm in this case. To put it another way, compared to another offender who removed the video one day later or worse did not remove the video at all, the accused was comparatively less culpable.

26     Additionally, there was no evidence that other than the two persons referred to in the SOF (see \[10\] above), the video clip was viewed by any other followers to the Instagram Account. There was also no indication of any consequent wider spread of the video by any of the followers to the Instagram Account.

27     I also agreed with the Defence that in both the cases of _Chan Chun Hong v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 465</span> and _Public Prosecutor v Koh Kwok Lun, Samuel_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 130</span> cited by the Prosecution, there were some aggravating factors that are not present in this case such as the sordid nature of the materials (_eg_, child pornography) and the exploitation of a vulnerable victim respectively.

28     Nevertheless, I arrived at the same sentence as that submitted by the Prosecution for the Obscene Circulation Charge, albeit for different reasons. This was primarily because there were other significant aggravating facts in this case that were absent in the precedent cases.

29     First, what was particularly aggravating about the Obscene Circulation Charge was that the accused had posted the obscene video on the _Victim’s_ Instagram Account unlike the cases referenced at \[27\] above where the obscene videos were either disseminated via email to others or through an unrelated party’s social media account. The harm caused to a victim would undoubtedly be graver where an obscene video involving the victim had been posted on the victim’s own social media profile, given that the victim’s immediate social circle would have direct access to the obscene video.

30     Second, the manner of the offending, which was the subject matter of one of the TIC Charges, was highly pertinent. Here, the accused had obtained unauthorised access to the Instagram Account to commit the offence (see \[9\] above). In the process, the accused had also changed the login credentials to the Instagram Account. The accused admitted that he did so in order to delay the Victim from accessing his Instagram Account and to prevent the Victim from deleting the obscene video clip. The circumstances in which the Obscene Circulation Charge was committed therefore clearly aggravated the offence.

31     In my judgment and being mindful that I was required to sentence the accused under the erstwhile punishment regime where the prescribed maximum term of imprisonment was 3 months’ imprisonment, I found that a sentence of 10 weeks’ imprisonment for the Obscene Circulation Charge was appropriate.

### Global Sentence

32     Both the Prosecution and the Defence agreed that the two custodial sentences should run consecutively. As the offences were committed by the accused on separate occasions and violated distinct legally protected interests of the Victim, in line with the authoritative decision in _Public Prosecutor v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 799</span> at \[41\]–\[42\], I ordered both sentences to run consecutively.

## Concluding Remarks

33     The accused had maliciously weaponised recordings of intimate moments he had shared with the Victim when their relationship turned sour. The accused perpetrated what is commonly referred to as “revenge porn” to vindictively punish the Victim for breaking up with him. His actions called for not only specific deterrence but also general deterrence to send the appropriate public signal that such actions are simply reprehensible.

34     It cannot be gainsaid that electronic transmission of such intimate recordings could have unthinkable repercussions. For instance, any of the followers to the Instagram Account could easily have taken a video screenshot of the obscene video and recirculated it on other platforms. The potential for irreparable harm to the Victim was real in this case. Given these considerations, the global term of 18 weeks’ imprisonment was, in my judgment, most commensurate with the gravity of the offences committed by the accused.

35     I accordingly sentenced the accused to a global term of 18 weeks’ imprisonment.
