Criminal Law – Discharge Not Amounting to an Acquittal

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9133/2022/01.\]

4 August 2022

### District Judge Eugene Teo Weng Kuan:

1       Mr Ahmad Danial bin Mohamed Rafa’ee knew one Ms Felicia Teo Wei Ling. In late June 2007, Ms Felicia Teo suddenly went missing. A widely publicized search for her was undertaken by the authorities and the family & friends of Ms Felicia Teo. Known to be amongst the few to have been with Ms Felicia Teo when she was last seen alive, Mr Ahmad Danial was questioned by the authorities during that period, but he claimed then that he did not know what happened to Ms Felicia Teo or where she was. Time passed, but there was no closure on the case as Ms Felicia Teo remained missing.

2       In 2020, a review by the authorities of the case led to Mr Ahmad Danial being questioned again. This time, Mr Ahmad Danial eventually revealed that he actually knew all along what had happened to Ms Felicia Teo: that he was involved in the disposal of her bodily remains; that he was involved in the disposal of her possessions – which included planting some in circumstances to convey a false impression and evade suspicion; and that he had been less than truthful with the authorities in 2007 when he withheld all of that information about what he had done, and about what had happened to her.

3       The context recounted thus far was beyond dispute when the parties came before me.

4       What was still not yet apparent was what actually happened to Ms Felicia Teo. Those details were still not yet before the court.

5       Against that context, the issue which the parties presented before me was, effectively, whether Mr Ahmad Danial should be granted absolute immunity from further prosecution for the death of Ms Felicia Teo. After considering the submissions, I found no basis for that. Dissatisfied with my refusal, Mr Ahmad Danial has since filed an appeal. I now set down the grounds for my decision.

## Background to the Application:

6       On 17 December 2020, Mr Ahmad Danial was charged in court with the murder of Ms Felicia Teo. The murder charge (TRC 900698/2020) indicated that the act took place on 30th June 2007 sometime between 1.39 am and 7.20 am at a unit at Block 19 Marine Terrace, with the common intention of one Ragil Putra Setia Bin Sukmarahjana (Male, 32 years old, hereafter referred to as “Ragil Putra”). Given the nature of the murder charge, Mr Ahmad Danial was remanded. The usual assessments were then ordered on Mr Ahmad Danial whilst investigations continued.

7       On 27 June 2022, the parties came before me at Mentions Court 4A during a routine mention for the case. The learned DPP was brief in stating the Prosecution’s position: that based on the investigation findings thus far, the Prosecution was applying under section 232 of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 to withdraw the murder charge because the co-accused Ragil Putra was still at-large and the efforts to trace him in Indonesia were on-going. In the meantime, based on evidence gathered during Mr Ahmad Danial’s remand, the Prosecution was tendering 6 new charges against him for the actions he took in 2007 subsequent to the death of Ms Felicia Teo. It was indicated to me by the parties that these 6 charges were not being disputed by Mr Ahmad Danial, though a plea offer on which was to be proceeded with was still being worked out. In gist, the 6 charges were for Mr Ahmad Danial’s actions in:

> i.     Disposing the bodily remains of Ms Felicia Teo at Punggol Track 24, committed with Ragil Putra (MAC 904638/2022);

> ii.     Dishonestly misappropriating the property of the deceased Ms Felicia Teo (i.e. one handphone, one laptop and one DSLR with accessories), committed with Ragil Putra (MAC 904639/2022);

> iii.     Failing to furnish information to the authorities on the death of Ms Felicia Teo, committed with Ragil Putra (MAC904640/2022);

> iv.     Giving false information to the SPF in 2007 that Ms Felicia Teo had left the unit at Block 19 on her own and that he did not know what happened to her (MAC 904641/2022);

> v.     Fabricating false evidence together with Ragil Putra by placing the handphone of Ms Felicia Teo at East Coast Park to support the false information which they later provided to the SPF that Ms Felicia Teo had left for East Coast Park (DAC 910345/2022); and

> vi.     Fabricating false evidence together with Ragil Putra by making calls to Ms Felicia Teo’s handphone, leaving voicemails thereon, and sending messages to Ms Felicia Teo on social media, all to create the false impression that both thought she was still alive when both knew she was already deceased (DAC 910346/2022).

8       Brief written submissions were also filed by the Prosecution, and they covered the same points. The Prosecution delisted the murder charge from the High Court, renumbered it as DAC 910393/2022, and applied before me to withdraw the charge, and for a Discharge Not Amounting to an Acquittal (“DNAQ”) to be granted to Mr Ahmad Danial.

9       In response, learned Counsel submitted that Mr Ahmad Danial ought to be granted an outright Discharge Amounting to an Acquittal (“DATA”) instead. A number of factual claims were made, but the submission was ultimately based on the following three broad points:

> a.     That the accused and his family have, for the past one and a half years, undergone a terrible time of suffering after the murder charge was brought against him;

> b.     That the progress of the investigations into the murder has been unsatisfactory, and is likely to remain so for an indeterminate period, and all this has resulted in, and will continue to result in, insufferable prejudice to the accused and his family; and

> c.     That the accused instructs that he is not responsible for the death of Ms Felicia Teo, and there is no evidence before the court to the contrary.

10     Learned Counsel then pleaded, in the interests of justice, that the accused ought to be granted an outright discharge amounting to an acquittal on the murder charge. Learned Counsel also indicated that the defence was ready to enter plea on the 6 charges and was seeking the earliest possible date because the expected sentence for them, in counsel’s estimation, was not likely to be anywhere near the period of remand which the accused has already suffered. It was also stated that Mr Ahmad Danial was eager to put this episode behind him and wanted to move on.

11     In response, the learned DPP simply reiterated the Prosecution’s position, and indicated that they were ready to accept an early date for plea to be taken on the 6 charges.

## Decision:

12     I considered the defence submission carefully. I now explain why each of the three points raised by the defence did not, in my judgment, amount to justification for an outright discharge amounting to an acquittal on the murder charge.

13     To put the defence’s application in context, I think it is important for one to first appreciate the unprecedented immensity of the ask being sought. In essence, the defence was asking this court to confer upon Mr Ahmad Danial absolute legal immunity from ever being taken to task for the murder of Ms Felicia Teo even if evidence of that act should subsequently come to light.

14     Such immunity is unheard off in non-fictional settings. For good reason because we hold dear the value and dignity of human life, and will pursue all who treat it with less than the regard which it deserves. So odious the crime that there are no limits to our resolve which remains undiminished nor unhindered by time. In the present case, the defence was precisely asking this court to put such a limit in place in favour of Mr Ahmad Danial and to make him the exception.

15     Whilst I accepted that the court does indeed have the discretion to direct that the discharge amounts to an acquittal (_TS Video and laser Pte Ltd v Lim Chee Yong_ \[2001\]3 SLR(R) 639 at \[7\]), I think that once the true import of the defence’s application is fully appreciated, it then influences the matters which ought to be shown in justification. Those matters had to be so significant that they completely displace society’s interest in holding to account all those responsible for these most serious of crimes. It bears stating as well that it was for the defence to displace the initial presumption that the discharge ought not to ordinarily amount to an acquittal: section 232(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010.

16     With that standard in mind, I could not agree that the matters cited by the defence came close to doing so. Even if credence was given to the factual claims being made by the defence as to the many hardships suffered by Mr Ahmad Danial ever since he was charged and remanded for the murder, they did not to my mind come close to even displacing the larger and solemn public interest in ensuring that all those who may be responsible for Ms Felicia Teo’s death are held to account for their actions. Without belittling the length of remand served by Mr Ahmad Danial thus far, the period of one and a half years could not be said to be unduly long in the context of the case. This is especially since it was the agreed position before me that progress has been made in the case during that period, with it now being established that Mr Ahmad Danial was indeed involved in Ms Felicia Teo’s disappearance and that he was going to own up to charges in that regard.

17     I hasten to add that nothing here should be taken as an endorsement of investigations which rely on remand and the deprivation of liberty to establish a case, nor that it was even the situation here. The remarks made thus far are simply on account of the factually accepted position as it was presented before me; i.e. that the case has progressed, and that the accused was not entirely uninvolved.

18     Turning next to the hardships and harassments suffered by Mr Ahmad Danial’s wife and family, I acknowledged that they were not trivial. The public’s interest is in ensuring that only those criminally responsible are held to account, but not more than that. Before me, there was no evidence that Mr Ahmad Danial’s wife and family were involved in his actions, and they – like any other member of the public – therefore deserve to go about their affairs peaceably without undue interference from others. So too Mr Ahmad Danial once he has served his due for his admitted actions. The solutions to undue interference – and they are varied and already present – do not however involve limiting the said public interest to create exceptions. That would be to impose the entirely wrong solution to the issue.

19     I would add that no law nor authority was also cited by the defence in its application. That was not surprising because, to my knowledge, none have ever qualified for such immunity nor deserved it on account of the hardships being claimed here. Therefore, having reviewed the factual claims put forth by the defence in its first two points, I therefore determined that insufficient grounds had been shown to justify the application for an outright discharge amounting to an acquittal.

20     I now turn to the last point put forth by the defence. It bears repeating that the parties attended before me during a routine mention for the case. Such court sessions are not structured to arrive at substantive and definitive findings on the facts and merits of a case. It was therefore far beyond the scope of the court session to conclude on Mr Ahmad Danial’s instructions “that he was not responsible for the death of Ms Felicia Teo”. In fact, the case itself indicated that some caution was due before any such conclusion could be safely reached. After all, this was an individual who had shown himself, over an extended period, adept at putting up false pretenses, adept at keeping the darkest of all secrets, and adept at marshalling those two skills together in self-preservation and in pursuance of his own interests. The Prosecution indicated that they were not prepared to take a final position on Mr Ahmad’s Danial’s word, and that their efforts to verify it were still continuing. Given the circumstances before me, the Prosecution’s position appeared eminently justified. There was no basis to deny the Prosecution that option.

21     For these reasons, the Defence’s application as it was presented before me was dismissed. It was my judgment that the public’s interest would be better served by granting a discharge not amounting to an acquittal and I so ordered.

22     Bail was offered for Mr Ahmad Danial for the 6 charges, and the earliest possible date, after taking into account the schedules of both sides, was also given to the parties for those 6 charges to be dealt with. As at the date of issue of these grounds, that court session has since been adjourned at the application of the parties, and Mr Ahmad Danial remains on bail.
