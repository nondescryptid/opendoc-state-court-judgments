\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9171/2021/01.\]

24 May 2022

### District Judge Ng Cheng Thiam:

## Introduction

1       The Accused was charged with two counts of Criminal Breach of Trust (“CBT”) under s 406 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) ( “PC”) and eight counts of Carrying on a Business as a Travel Agent without a valid licence under s 6(1) of the Travel Agents Act (Cap 334, 1998 Rev Ed) (“TAA”) read with ss 4(1)(_b_), 4(1)(_d_) and 4(1)(_e_) of the TAA and punishable under s 6(2) of the TAA.

2       The Accused pleaded guilty to one CBT charge and two TAA charges. One other CBT charge under s 406 of the PC and six similar TAA charges were taken into consideration for sentencing.

3       The Accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification. I found her guilty and convicted her accordingly.

4       After having carefully considered the Prosecution’s address on sentence and the Defence’s plea-in-mitigation and its address on sentence, I imposed the following sentences:

5       The Accused was dissatisfied with the sentences imposed. Thus, the Accused filed an appeal against sentence.

## Material Facts

6       The material facts are summarised below:

> (a)     In 2000, the Accused worked as a freelance travel agent.

> (b)     In 2004, the Accused worked for a licence travel agent handling booking of tour packages from customers. She left the job after nine months. She then ran her own business as a freelance travel agent. She provided her services to her customers as a freelance travel agent and accepted payments from these customers.

> **_Accused’s Modus Operandi_**

> (c)     The Accused represented to her customers that she was able to make bookings for tours to India and Dubai for them. The Accused provided advice on various aspects of the trip from insurance, currency exchange to local tours. She advised them on the mode of travel, the accommodation arrangements and travel itineraries. She gave them a quotation for their desired tour. Once her customers confirmed the tour, they would make a deposit payment to her. A few months before the departure date of the tour, the Accused would collect the balance payment from her customers.

> (d)     At all material times, the Accused knew that she did not have the requisite licence to operate as a travel agent as required under s 6 of the TAA read with s 4(1) of the TAA.

> (e)     The Accused used the monies she collected from her customers for her own expenses. She did not make air tickets and hotel bookings for her customers’ tours to India or Dubai. Nearing to, or after, the planned date of the tour, the Accused lied to her customers that her mother was hospitalised and/or was in the Intensive Care Unit, which fact she knew to be false. Using this ruse, the Accused would seek to postpone the trip or refund the monies to her customers. When her customers pressed her for the air tickets so that they could travel to India or Dubai on their own, the Accused was unable to provide the air tickets to them.

> **_The CBT Offence_**

> (f)     In February 2017, the Accused collected a sum of $2400 from an 85 year old customer to book a tour to Kasi, India (“the Kasi trip”). On the date of the planned departure date, the Accused did not turn up to meet her customers. She could not be contacted. Two days later, the Accused lied to the customer’s friend that her mother was hospitalised and therefore the Kasi trip had to be cancelled. The customer’s friend asked the Accused for proof that she had booked the air tickets. The Accused was unable to exhibit such proof. The Accused had used the said sum for her own expenses.

> (g)     From March 2017 to August 2017, the Accused collected a total sum of $15,450 from six customers. The Accused was entrusted with the said sum for the purpose of booking tours to Dubai for November 2017. The Accused did not make any booking for any tour. Instead, the Accused used the said sum of money for her own expenses. To cover up her crime, on 22 November 2017, the Accused sent a message in a chat group comprising four of her customers claiming that her mother had a sudden attack and was hospitalized in the intensive care unit. She needed to postpone the trip to 7 December 2017. In fact, the Accused’s mother did not suffer a sudden heart attack and was not hospitalized in an intensive care unit. On 22 November 2017, she also lied to another customer that the trip was cancelled because she was required to attend to a matter in court on 27 November 2017.

> (h)     The customers wanted the Accused to provide them with the air tickets and accommodation details so that they could still proceed with the tour without the Accused. The Accused was unable to do so because she had dishonestly misappropriated the monies entrusted to her by using them for her own expenses.

> (i)     The Accused had therefore committed an offence of criminal breach of trust. The total sum involved was $$17,850. The Accused made full restitution to the seven customers on 3 June 2020.

> **_The TAA offences_**

> (j)     From 2013 to 2017, the Accused offered travel agency services to her clients by selling tours to places outside Singapore. She sought clients in her own capacity and represented that she was a freelance travel agent. The Accused accepted payments for the sale of the overseas tours. The Accused was thus carrying on a business of a travel agent as defined under s 4 of the TAA. However, at all material times, the Accused was not in possession of the requisite licence required under s 6 of the TAA.

> Facts specific to MAC-900989-2019

> (k)     Sometime in or around June 2013, acting in breach of the relevant TAA provisions, the Accused held herself out to a client to arrange, conduct and sell a 15 days and 14 nights tour to India for the client and nine members of her family. The tour package comprised of the air tickets and accommodation at hotels in India. The tour to India was scheduled for 21 December 2013 to 4 January 2014. The Accused received a total sum of $17,100 from the client for the said tour. The Accused did not carry out her obligations to book the tour for her clients. She did not use the said sum of money to make bookings for the tour to India. Instead, the Accused used the said sum of money for her personal expenses.

> (l)     On 18 December 2013, the Accused informed her clients that she had to cancel the trip as her mother was sick and admitted to the hospital, which the Accused knew was not true at all.

> (m)     The Accused made full restitution on 20 June 2020.

> Facts specific to MAC-900985-2019

> (n)     Sometime in or around July 2017, acting in breach of the relevant TAA provisions, the Accused held herself out to a client and the client’s mother that she could arrange, conduct and sell a seven days and six nights tour to Dubai. The tour package comprised of the air tickets and accommodation at hotels in Dubai. The Accused received $3,900 from the client as payment, but failed to carry out her obligations to book the tour for the client.

7       I have reproduced the SOF in its entirety at the end of these grounds of decision.

## Antecedent

8       The Accused does not have any criminal antecedent.

## Summary of the Prosecution’s Position on Sentence

9       The Prosecution sought a global sentence of at least 5 months’ imprisonment, and the Prosecution’s position on the individual sentences have been summarised in Table B below:

### Aggravating Factors

10     In support of its sentencing position, the Prosecution urged the Court to give weight to the following aggravating factors:

> (a)     The Accused has abused the trust imposed on her by her clients;

> (b)     The Accused has committed multiple offences using the same _modus operandi_; and

> (c)     The period of offending was long. Based on the Prosecution’s calculation, the period of offending was 16 months across four years.

11     The Prosecution acknowledged that the Accused had pleaded guilty. However, the Prosecution pointed out that the Accused had pleaded guilty at the doorstep of a trial. As such, any sentencing discount that is usually given for a plea of guilt ought to be reduced.

## Defence’s Plea-in-Mitigation and Defence’s Sentencing Position

### Plea-in-Mitigation

12     In its plea-in-mitigation, the Defence highlighted several areas which can be summarised as follows:

> (a)     The circumstances of the Accused’s offending;

> (b)     The Accused’s plea of guilt, co-operation and remorse;

> (c)     The Accused’s lack of antecedents; and

> (d)     The Accused has made full restitution.

The details of the Defence’s submissions on each area are set out below.

##### (1)   The circumstances of the Accused’s offending

13     The Accused had initially offered her services of organising overseas travel to India and the Middle East to her family members and her friends. As her family members and her friends enjoyed the overseas trips organised by her, they invited their own friends along for future trips. The Accused did not earn any profit from organising and arranging these overseas trips. Her air tickets and accommodation were borne by herself, as were her personal expenses.

14     For one of the trips to India, the Accused collected the monies from her friends and family and paid them to the travel agent from India (“the foreign travel agent”). The foreign travel agent became uncontactable and cheated the Accused of the monies. She thus utilised the monies she had collected for the CBT offence to pay for this particular India trip.

15     The Accused’s crime was thus not planned nor premediated to cause loss to her clients, but rather done on the spur of the moment when she was cheated by the foreign travel agent.

16     I was not persuaded by the Defence’s submissions and arguments. In its written submissions, the Defence stated that the Accused was cheated during a trip in **_India_** (see \[9\] of Exhibit D1). However, in the course of oral arguments, the Defence said that it was for the 2017 trip to **_Dubai_**. The hearing was stood down for a couple of minutes for Counsel to obtain instructions from the Accused. After taking the Accused’s instruction, the Defence informed the Court that the Accused had “_similar issues_” for the 2013 offending and the 2017 offending (see Notes of Evidence: Day 2, at page 14 from line 14 to page 15 till line 18). It was clear to the Court that the Accused was claiming to have been cheated by the foreign travel agent or agents in 2013 and 2017. I did not accept the Defence’s submission. Firstly, the alleged cheating for the India trip was devoid of details. Secondly, the alleged cheating for the Dubai trip was a mere last minute allegation which was not substantiated by any proof. I therefore gave no weight to this aspect of the Accused’s plea-in-mitigation.

##### (2)   The Accused’s plea of guilt, co-operation and remorse

17     In respect of the two CBT offences, the Prosecution had initially classified the offence under s 409 of the PC, which is for the offence of Criminal Breach of Trust by a Servant or Agent. The maximum punishment prescribed by law is imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 20 years, and shall also be liable to fine. However, as the case is tried in the District Court, then by operation of s 303(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, Cap 68, 2010 Rev Ed.) (“CPC”), the maximum sentence is imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years and shall also be liable to fine.

18     The Accused’s case was set down for trial commencing on 21 March 2021. On the first day of the trial, there was a change in the Prosecution’s position. The Prosecution amended the two charges under s 409 PC to lesser charges under s 406 of the PC. In view of the amendment made to the CBT offences, coupled with a revised plea offer, the Accused elected to plead guilty. The Defence thus argued that the Accused has pleaded at the earliest available opportunity. In the circumstances, the Defence submitted that a full sentencing discount should be given for the Accused’s early plea of guilt. The Defence further submitted that the Accused’s plea of guilt showed remorse on her part. It has also saved time and resources for the Court and the Prosecution.

19     The Defence also submitted that the Accused has co-operated with the authorities during investigation and this was another indicator of her remorse.

##### (3)   The Accused’s lack of antecedents

20     The Defence submitted that the Accused was not a repeat or recalcitrant offender. The Defence further submitted that she has a strong potential for reform and rehabilitation.

##### (4)   The Accused has made full restitution

21     The Defence submitted that full restitution has been made, albeit late. The Defence reasoned that the Accused could not make restitution earlier because she did not have funds to do so. Time was needed to raise the funds to make restitution. The Defence further argued that the Accused made the restitution not in expectation of a lighter sentence, but due to her genuine remorse and her desire that her clients were “not out of pocket” because of her actions.

22     My assessment on the Accused’s plea-in-mitigation from \[17\] to \[21\] are dealt with at \[26\] to \[33\] below.

### Defence’s Sentencing Position

23     The Defence sought a sentence of not more than three and a half (3.5) months’ imprisonment for the CBT offence.

24     With regards to the TAA offences, the Defence sought a fine of not more than $1,500 in respect of MAC-900985-2019 where the amount of money involved in the transactions was $3,900, and a fine of $2,500 in respect of MAC-900989-2019 where the amount of money involved in the transactions was $17,100.

## Court’s decision on sentence

25     Before I deal with the sentencing proper for each of the proceeded charges, I shall first set out my assessment of the weight to be attached to the Accused’s plea-in-mitigation at \[17\] to \[21\].

### Weight to be attached to the Accused’s plea-in-mitigation

##### (1)   The Accused’s plea of guilt

26     The Defence submitted that the Accused has shown remorse by pleading guilty without the need for a trial. The Defence disagreed with the Prosecution’s characterization that the Accused has pleaded guilty at the doorstep. The Defence’s contention was that the Accused was never an agent within s 409 of the PC. The Defence thus had a partial defence should the Accused be tried for the offence under s 409 of the Penal Code. Hence, when the charge was amended to s 406 of the PC on the first day of the trial, the Accused decided to plead guilty.

27     In its written skeletal submissions, the Prosecution brought to the Court’s attention that the current proceeding had taken place in the midst of a second set of trial dates. Furthermore, the Accused had indicated her intention to plead guilty for which her plea of guilt was taken on 30 March 2020. Subsequently, on 23 June 2020, when parties returned for mitigation, the Accused retracted her plea of guilt. The Prosecution further highlighted that time and resources were wasted as the matter had to go through the Criminal Case Disclosure Conference regime. Additional time and resources were wasted as the Prosecution had to prepare witnesses twice.

28     Whilst I agreed that the Accused was entitled to a sentencing discount in view of her plea of guilt, I also agreed with the Prosecution’s submissions that it had not been timely and significant public resources had been wasted.

##### (2)   Restitution

29     The Defence informed the Court that full restitution was made by the Accused. The Prosecution argued that while full restitution should be given mitigating weight, the timing of such restitution should also be taken into consideration. The Prosecution referred to _Hoong Hee Sin v Public Prosecutor_ \[2001\] 1 SLR (R) 475 at \[9\] where the former Chief Justice Yong Pung How held:

> 9.    … … In _Krishan Chand v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] 1 SLR(R) 737</span>, it was said that the fact of restitution goes to some extent towards showing remorse, genuine good character and reformation on the part of the offender. Restitution made voluntarily before the commencement of criminal proceedings or in its earliest stages thus carries a higher mitigating value for it shows that the offender is genuinely sorry for his mistake. On the other hand, where the sole motive for restitution is the hope or expectation of obtaining a lighter punishment, then the fact of restitution must be of little mitigating value. … … In my view, restitution as a mitigating factor is of decisive significance only when it is made voluntarily for only then would it be a display of true moral conscience on the part of the accused.

30     The Prosecution pointed out that the offences were committed between 2013 and 2017. The Accused made restitution of $300 in 2017 and the balance sum of $34,650 was paid as restitution on 3 June 2020.

31     Having regard to the late stage of the Accused’s plea of guilt and her delay in making restitution, the Court assessed that she would still be entitled to some sentencing discount, although not as much as that sought by her Counsel.

##### (3)   The Accused’s lack of antecedents and co-operation

32     With respect to the Accused’s lack of antecedents and co-operation with the Police, these are neutral points. No weight was given in my assessment on sentence.

33     In sentencing the Accused, I followed the two-step sentencing approach enunciated in _Mohammed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span>:

> (a)     At the first step, I considered the appropriate sentence for each charge. In this regard, I first considered the appropriate indicative starting sentence. Then, I weighed and assessed the aggravating and mitigating factors. In the entire exercise, I took guidance from relevant case precedents; and

> (b)     At the second step, in determining which of the sentences ought to run consecutively or concurrently, I was mindful of the one transaction rule and the totality principle.

### The CBT offence

##### (1)   Prosecution’s submissions

34     In addition to the aggravating factors (see \[10\] above), the Prosecution referred the court to four case precedents and the more pertinent ones were:

> (a)      _Public Prosecutor v Osi Maria Elenora Protacio_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 78</span>

>> The offender worked as a receptionist at a dental clinic. Her job responsibilities included, amongst others, collecting payments from customers and depositing these monies into the clinic’s bank account. She pleaded guilty to one charge of criminal breach of trust under s 406 of the PC for dishonest misappropriation of $14,089.95 between 4 January 2014 and 24 December 2014 at the clinic. A second charge under s 406 of the PC for dishonest misappropriation of $12.534.30 between 2 January 2015 and 20 August 2015 at the clinic was taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. The offender used the monies she had misappropriated to settle her personal debts. The district court meted out a fine of $4,000. The prosecution appealed.

>> On appeal, the prosecution relied on case precedents where the amount misappropriated was substantial and where the offence occurred over a long period of time. These case precedents involved accused persons who pleaded guilty, made full restitution and had clean records. Even after accounting for these mitigating factors, the High Court held that a more appropriate sentence would be 15 weeks’ imprisonment. The $4,000 fine imposed for an offence involving a large sum of money is too lenient in light of the case precedents, and would also fail to achieve the sentencing objective of deterrence. The High Court allowed the prosecution’s appeal on sentence and ordered the sentence to be enhanced to 15 weeks’ imprisonment.

> (b)      _Public Prosecutor v Chan King Wui_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGDC 151</span>

>> The offender pleaded guilty to one charge of criminal breach of trust under s 406 of the PC. The offender was a System Administrator with M/s Watson’s Personal Care Stores Pte Ltd (“Watsons”). As a System Administrator and one of five personnel holding the key to the server room, the offender was entrusted with computer equipment belonging to Watsons. On 19 occasions spanning a period of 11 months, the offender dishonestly misappropriated numerous personal computers and laptops from Watsons’ server room. The total value of the items was $24,527.88. The offender had deliberately assessed the server room on weekends when there were few people around. The offender took the items and keep them in his car. The items were sold to customers on online platform where the offender used a moniker “GameKing” to avoid detection. The District Judge found that there was premeditation and planning in committing the offence. The offender had committed the offences to satisfy his personal debts.

>> The District Judge stated that the norm sentence for such cases would be a custodial term of six to seven months imprisonment. A sentencing discount was given as the offender had made full restitution. The offender to sentenced to four months’ imprisonment.

35     The Prosecution also referred the Court to two unreported decisions. In this respect, I was mindful that case precedents without grounds or explanations should bear little weight, if any, because they are unreasoned. A sentencing court should approach such case precedents with caution: _Janardana Jayasankarr v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 1288</span> at \[13(b)\]. That said, I have observed that the sentencing range that this court could glean from the sentencing precedents is consistent with the general principle that the severity of sentence must be commensurate with the amount of loss caused in an offence. In an offence like criminal breach of trust, where all other things are equal, the larger the amount misappropriated the greater the culpability of the offender and the more severe the sentence of the court: _Wong Kai Chuen Philip v Public Prosecutor_ \[1990\] 2 SLR (R) 361 (“_Philip Wong_”) at \[18\].

36     In summary, the case precedents cited by the Prosecution showed that the sentence of imprisonment imposed ranged from 15 weeks to four months’ imprisonment.

##### (2)   Defence’s submissions

37     The Defence began with an indicative starting sentence of three months’ imprisonment, relying on the case of _PP v Harveen Kaur d/o Jaginder Singh_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 114</span> (“_Harveen”_). The offender in _Harveen_ pleaded guilty to one charge under s 406 of the PC. The offender was entrusted with the victim’s jewellery box. The offender took the victim’s jewelleries and pawned them without the victim’s consent and knowledge. The amount involved was $16,250. Only three pieces of jewelleries were recovered. The offender made full restitution. The District Judge followed sentencing precedents which showed that 15 weeks to three months’ imprisonment have been imposed where the value of the items misappropriated ranged from $12,996 to $16,546. The offender was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment.

38     As the Accused has another CBT offence being taken into consideration for sentencing, the Defence factored in an uplift of one month’s imprisonment. This would then be reduced to half a month after accounting for the Accused’s plea of guilt and that full restitution has been made.

39     The Defence’s final sentencing position for the CBT offence was three and a half months’ imprisonment.

##### (3)   Sentence imposed by the Court for the CBT offence

40     It is a well-established general principle “that in sentencing for financial and property offences, the greater the economic value involved in the offence, the heavier the sentence”: _Gan Chai Bee Anne v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 4 SLR 838</span> (“_Gan Chai_ Bee”) at \[42\] which followed _Public Prosecutor v Fernando Payagala Waduge Malitha Kumar_ \[2007\] 2 SLR (R) 334 at \[47\] and _Lim Ying Luciana v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 1220</span> at \[69\]. I was also conscious of the pronouncement in _Public Prosecutor v Lam Leng Hung and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 474</span> at \[368\] that:

> 368.  … … \[t\]he court’s discretion in sentencing is never restricted to the application of a mathematical formula based on the amount in question. … The appropriate sentence to be imposed must be arrived at after having regard not just to the amounts in question, but also to the totality of the circumstances, particularly the specific facts of the case

41     I have reviewed the case precedents cited by the Prosecution and the Defence carefully. In my assessment, these case precedents showed that the **indicative starting sentence** involving sums between $15,000 to $25,000 lies in the range of three to six months’ imprisonment (emphasis in bold in original). Thereafter, the courts would consider the presence and absence of aggravating and mitigating factors and the weight to be attached to these factors. This probably explains why the final sentences imposed in the case precedents were different in each case.

42     In the present case, the amount misappropriated in the CBT offence was $17,850. It was my assessment that the indicative starting sentence should be 16 weeks’ imprisonment.

43     The next step is to consider the aggravating and mitigating factors and then consider whether the indicative sentence ought to be adjusted upwards or downwards. I agreed with the aggravating factors highlighted by the Prosecution (see \[10\] above). In addition, another CBT charge was taken into consideration. An uplift of the indicative starting sentence was warranted. As regards the mitigating factors, I took into account the Accused’s plea of guilt and the restitution made (see \[26\] to \[31\] above). In my assessment, the upward adjustment for the aggravating factor outweighed the downward adjustment for the mitigating factors. Summing up, a one-week uplift to the indicative starting sentence was warranted.

44     I therefore imposed a sentence of 17 weeks’ imprisonment for the CBT offence.

### The TAA offences

##### (1)   Prosecution’s submissions

45     The Prosecution highlighted that the Accused had been carrying on unlicensed travel agency business for around five years. As she had worked in a travel agency before, the Accused ought to know that a licence is required for such a business. There was also premeditation on her part. After receiving the customers’ money, the Accused did nothing. Nearing the agreed travel date, she lied that her mother had fallen ill and cancelled trip. In total, there were 19 unfulfilled trips. The Prosecution sought a custodial sentence.

46     The Prosecution referred to a harm-culpability sentencing matrix which the Prosecution had used in the case of _Public Prosecutor v Rohani Bte Harun (DAC-906034-2017 and others, unreported_) (“_Rohani_”). The said sentencing matrix is reproduced below:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="24.94%"><col width="25.2%"><col width="24.92%"><col width="24.94%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="right" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Harm</b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Culpability</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Slight</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Moderate</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Severe</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Low</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fine up to $10,000 and/or custodial term of less than 4 months</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">At least ¼ of X (4 months’ imprisonment)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">At least ½ of X (8 months’ imprisonment)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Medium</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">At least ¼ of X (4 months’ imprisonment)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">At least ½ of X (8 months’ imprisonment)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">At least ¾ of X (12 months’ imprisonment)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>High</b></p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">At least ½ of X (8 months’ imprisonment)</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">At least ¾ of X (12 months’ imprisonment)</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">At least X (16 months’ imprisonment)</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

> Where X = 2/3 of the maximum prescribed punishment for the TAA offence

47     In _Rohani_, the offender was carrying on the business of a freelance travel agent without the requisite licence. Between 2014 am 2016, 61 victims entrusted the offender with their money for the offender to purchase air tickets. The offender did not carry out her obligations. Instead, the offender misappropriated the monies. The offender was charged, amongst other offences, with 9 charges under s 6(1) of the TAA punishable under s 6(2) of the TAA. The very same offence that the Accused has been charged with. In _Rohani_, the offender was given the following custodial sentences for the TAA offences:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="26.12%"><col width="45.28%"><col width="28.6%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4<sup>th</sup> Charge</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Involving $9450,</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">9 unfulfilled air tickets</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Two months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5<sup>th</sup> Charge</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Involving $23,150</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">11 unfulfilled air tickets</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Three months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">10<sup>th</sup> Charge</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Involving $4,650</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3 unfulfilled air tickets</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Two months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

48     Applying the said harm-culpability sentencing matrix to the present case, the Prosecution placed the Accused within the Low Culpability/Slight Harm segment and submitted for a custodial sentence (see Table at \[9\] above).

49     The Prosecution urged the Court to adopt the said harm-culpability sentencing matrix to sentence the Accused for the TAA offences

##### (2)   Defence’s submissions

50     The Defence submitted that a fine would suffice for each of the two proceeded TAA offences. The Defence’s main contention was that a fine has been imposed in all sentencing case precedents for the TAA offence, except _Rohani_. The Defence urged the Court not to follow _Rohani_.

##### (3)   Sentence imposed by the Court for the TAA offences

51      _Rohani_ is an unreported decision. As I have stated in \[36\] above, case precedents without grounds or explanations should bear little weight, if any, because they are unreasoned. Additionally, I was mindful of the caution stated by the Court of Appeal in _Adri Anton Kalangie v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 2 SLR 557</span> at \[67\] where the CA stated: “\[r\]elatedly, since the court establishing a new sentencing framework will likely be an appellate court, the doctrine of prospective overruling will likewise most likely arise for consideration by an appellate court. … It would probably be a rare case where a first instance court, whether the High Court sitting in its original criminal jurisdiction or a State Court, has to calibrate a sentencing framework for the first time and must therefore consider the prospectivity of the framework laid down. Such a situation should generally be avoided.” I heeded the CA’s advice. For the reasons stated, I declined to adopt and use the harm-culpability sentencing matrix used in _Rohani_.

52     I was unable to agree with the Defence’s submissions that a fine for each of the TAA offences would be an adequate punishment. My reasons were threefold.

53     Firstly, I was guided by the decision of Menon CJ in _Gan Chai Bee_. In _Gan Chai Bee_, Menon CJ set considered what is the proper approach for determining the aggregate sentence in cases involving multiple offences each of which, taken alone, may be a minor offence meriting only a light sentence, but when taken together, demonstrated a single course of criminal conduct. The proper approach is a two-step analysis.

54     The first step of the sentencing analysis would be to determine the individual sentences for each proceeded charge. The second step of the sentencing analysis would be to consider the offending conduct in totality: see _Gan Chai Bee_ at \[31\] to \[40\].

55     In respect of the first step of the sentencing analysis, I first considered the decision of _Idya Nurhazlyn bte Ahmad Khir v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 1 SLR 756</span> (“_Idya_”)_._ In _Idya_, the appellant had pleaded guilty to two charges of cheating under s 417 PC and two charges under the Passports Act (Cap 220, 2008 Rev Ed). In dealing with the s 417 PC offence, CJ Menon held that a custodial sentence is generally appropriate where the offence causes a victim to part with property that has more than negligible value. The sums involved in _Idya’s_ case were $1,800 (“1st cheating offence”) and $10,509 (“2nd cheating offence”), and they were found to be significant amount justifying the imposition of a custodial sentence. For the 1st cheating offence, the sentence was reduced on appeal from two months to one month’s imprisonment. For the 2nd cheating offence, the District Judge’s sentence of three months’ imprisonment was upheld. In my judgment, the underlying criminal element in the TAA offences was dishonesty. The victims looked to the Accused to arrange their overseas travel. The Accused did not do so. The sums of money misappropriated by the Accused was certainly more than negligible value. Applying _Idya’s_ sentencing principle _ie_ a custodial sentence is generally appropriate where the offence causes a victim to part with property that has more than negligible value, I found that a custodial sentence was warranted for the TAA offences.

56     The sentencing complexion remained unchanged when we moved to the second step of the sentencing analysis. In _Gan Chai Bee_, Menon CJ at \[39\] held that “when the amounts paid on the claims reflected in _all_ the charges, both proceeded with and taken into consideration, are aggregated, it will readily be seen that the property which the victim has parted with was of more than negligible value. What follows from this is that the conclusion that the custodial threshold was crossed is one that pertains to the totality of the appellant’s offending conduct …”. In the present case, the offending conduct involved the use of deceit and lies, committed over a long period of time, and the total amount that the victims lost came up to $34,950. In the circumstances, a fine was simply untenable.

57     Secondly, a distinction has to be drawn between an offender who operated without the requisite licence but delivered the overseas trips, and an offender who operated with the requisite licence and did not get the overseas trips done. The latter is obviously more culpable than the former. The Accused fell into the latter category.

58     Thirdly, it is trite that an accused’s not making any financial gain from an illegal transaction is not a mitigating factor, and the lack of profit I at best the absence of an aggravating factor.

59     Having found that a fine is not a suitable offence, I now turn to address the issue of the appropriate length of imprisonment to impose. In this respect, I agreed with the Prosecution’s submissions regarding the aggravating factors for the TAA offences. However, I found that the Prosecution did not provide adequate weight to the Accused’s plea of guilt and the restitution she has made. I therefore made a slight downward adjustment to the individual sentences proposed by the Prosecution for the TAA offences.

60     I therefore sentenced the Accused to one week’s imprisonment for MAC-900985-2019 and three weeks’ imprisonment for MAC-900989-2019.

## Conclusion

61     Since the Accused has been sentenced to imprisonment for more than two distinct offences, s 307 of the CPC requires that at least of two of the sentences be ordered to run consecutively.

62     The TAA offences were distinct and separate from the CBT offence. Consecutive sentencing of the CBT offence with one of the two TAA offences was appropriate. Of the two TAA offences, the monetary loss caused in MAC-900989-2019 was more than that in MAC-900985-2019. I thus ordered the three weeks’ imprisonment imposed in MAC-900989-2019 to run consecutively with the 17 weeks’ imprisonment imposed for the CBT offence.

Annex A: The Statement of Facts

## BACKGROUND FACTS

1.     The accused is S Leelavadi, a female 55 years old Singapore citizen (NRIC No: XXX, Date of Birth: 14 September 1965). At the material time, the accused was carrying on the business of a freelance travel agent without an appropriate licence granted by the Singapore Tourism Board (“STB”) under the Travel Agents Act (Chapter 334, 1998 Rev Ed) (“TAA”).

2.     Between 2013 and 2017, 8 victims entrusted the accused with their monies in the course of the accused’s business as a freelance travel agent, in order for the accused to make bookings for tours to India or Dubai for them. The accused did not fulfil these promises. Instead, the accused misappropriated the monies. The accused represented herself to the victims as a freelance travel agent.

3.     The Singapore Police Force (“SPF”) subsequently notified STB that the accused was being investigated for offences under the Penal Code (Chapter 224) and that she may have also contravened the TAA when she operated as a freelance travel agent. Consequently, the accused was also investigated by the STB for offences under the TAA.

4.     Investigations revealed that sometime in 2000, the accused started working on her own as a freelance travel agent. During this period, sometime in 2004, the accused worked for a licenced travel agent handling booking of tour packages from customers, but subsequently left within 9 months. Thereafter, she continued running her own business as a freelance travel agent.

5.     The accused represented to her customers that she was able to make bookings for tours to India and Dubai for them. She advised them on the mode of travel, the accommodation and itinerary at the tour destination. She gave them a quotation for their desired tour. Once her customers confirmed the tour, they would make payment of a S$500 deposit to her. The accused represented that the deposit was necessary to make the relevant bookings for their tour. In the months before the departure date of the tour, the accused would chase for the balance payment. Her customers would then make payment to her. She represented that the balance payment was necessary to make bookings for their tour.

6.     The accused would send her customers travel itineraries and advise on various aspects of the trip from insurance, currency exchange to local tours, leading her customers to believe that she was a travel agent. The accused had many customers, who she would then request to refer other customers to her.

7.     For the trips which are the subject of the present charges, the accused provided her services to her customers as a freelance travel agent and accepted payments from these customers. At all material times, the accused knew that she did not have the requisite licence to operate as a travel agent, as defined under Section 4 of the TAA and as stipulated under Section 6 of the TAA.

8.     The accused used these customers’ monies for her own expenses, without making bookings for their tours to India or Dubai for them. Losses occurred after the accused failed to deliver on her commitments due to insufficient funds. Nearing to, or after, the planned date of the tour, the accused would lie to her customers, claiming that her mother was hospitalised and/or in the Intensive Care Unit, which fact she knew to be false, and thereby seek their understanding with regards to the postponement or refund of the trip. When her customers pressed her for the flight tickets so that they could travel to India or Dubai on their own, the accused was unable to provide the flight tickets to them. In total, the accused misappropriated $34,950 from her victims.

## FACTS RELATING TO THE 1st CHARGE (DAC-933123-2018)

9.     In 2017, the accused carried on the business of a freelance travel agent. At all material times, she was not a holder of a licence granted to her or any other person on her behalf under the Travel Agents Act (Chapter 334, 1998 Rev Ed).

10.    Between February 2017 and November 2017, the accused, having been entrusted with property, to wit, payments amounting to a total of S$17,850 by seven customers to make bookings for tours to India or Dubai, did commit criminal breach of trust by dishonestly misappropriating the said property. The accused directed the seven customers to make full payment to her either through cash or bank transfer to her mother’s bank account – Anjamal d/o Aiasamy Pillai’s POSB Savings Account No: XXX (“Anjamal’s Account”). After the seven customers made full payment, the accused used their monies for her own expenses, without making bookings for their tours to India or Dubai for them. Nearing to, or on, the travel date, the seven customers had difficulties contacting the accused. Later on, the accused informed the seven customers that their trips had to be postponed and offered a refund. Losses occurred after the accused failed to deliver on her commitments.

Victim: Muniyandi Karuppayee (“Muniyandi”)

11.    Muniyandi is an 85-year-old Singapore citizen. At the material time, she was 82 years’ old. She was living in a rental flat with one other family.

12.    Sometime on or around 9 February 2017, Muniyandi was at an Indian sari shop owned by one Murugaian Elango (“Elango”). The accused offered to arrange a tour to Kasi, India for her. The cost of the tour was S$2,400. The tour to India was scheduled to be in or around February 2017. As Elango had known Muniyandi for some time, he was advising Muniyandi not to go on the trip due to her medical issues. Having heard Elango’s concerns, the accused told Elango not to worry. As Muniyandi was of her mother’s age, the accused re-assured Elango that she would take care of Muniyandi.

13.    Muniyandi agreed to pay S$2,400 to the accused for the accused to make bookings for her tour to Kasi, India in or around February 2017. On that same day, the accused requested for a deposit of S$1,000 from Muniyandi as she urgently needed the payment to book Muniyandi’s flight tickets for the Kasi, India trip. The accused received S$1,000 in cash for the purposes of this deposit.

14.    After the S$1,000 deposit was paid to the accused, the accused kept chasing Elango to ask Muniyandi for the balance payment of S$1,400 so that she could make the remaining bookings for Muniyandi’s trip to Kasi, India. On 13 February 2017, Elango, transferred the balance payment of S$1,400, on behalf of Muniyandi, to Anjamal’s Account.

15.    Sometime in or around February 2017, on the planned date of the trip to Kasi, India, Muniyandi packed her luggage and was waiting for the accused to pick her up to go to the airport, as arranged by the accused. However, the accused did not turn up and did not answer any of Elango’s calls. Two days after the planned date, the accused called Elango claiming that her mother was hospitalised, which fact she knew to be false, and therefore, the trip had to be cancelled. Despite Elango asking for proof that she had in fact booked flight tickets for Muniyandi, the accused was unable to show any proof of flight tickets booked for Muniyandi’s trip..

16.    In total, the accused was entrusted with the sum of S$2,400 by Elango on behalf of Muniyandi for the purpose of making bookings for Muniyandi’s tour to India. Instead, the accused used the monies for her own personal expenses.

Six Victims – K Kalaiselvi (“Kalaiselvi”); Ponnumathy w/o Subbaiah (“Ponnumathy”); Priscilla Kumari Anggamuthu (“Priscilla”); Rowena Anurupa Patrick (“Rowena”), Ramona Anuradha Patrick (“Ramona”) and Yew Yam Kheng (“Tricia Yew ”)

17.    From around March 2017 to October 2017, the accused offered to arrange a 7 days 6 nights tour to Dubai for 8 people. These 8 people are: Kalaiselvi and her daughter; Ponnumathy; Priscilla; Rowena, Ramona and their mother, Manoranjitham Esther Margaret Edwards; and Tricia Yew. The cost of the tour was between S$1,900 and S$1,950 per person. The tour to Dubai was scheduled to be from 23 – 30 November 2017.

18.    The six victims, Kalaiselvi, Ponnumathy, Priscilla, Rowena, Ramona and Tricia Yew, agreed to pay a total of S$15,450 to the accused for the accused to make bookings for their 7 days 6 nights tour to Dubai from 23 – 30 November 2017.

19.    As payment for the tour to Dubai, Kalaiselvi handed over a total sum of S$3,800 to the accused on the following occasions based on instructions given by the accused:

> a.     On 8 March 2017, Kalaiselvi transferred S$1,000 to Anjamal’s Account; and

> b.     On 20 July 2017, Kalaiselvi transferred S$2,800 to Anjamal’s Account.

20.    As payment for the tour to Dubai, Ponnumathy handed over a total sum of S$1,900 to the accused on the following occasions based on instructions given by the accused:

> a.     On 30 May 2017, Ponnumathy handed over S$500 in cash to the accused; and

> b.     On 5 August 2017, Ponnumathy handed over S$1,400 in cash to the accused.

21.    As payment for the tour to Dubai, Priscilla handed over a total sum of S$1,950 to the accused on the following occasions based on instructions given by the accused:

> a.     On 15 July 2017, Priscilla transferred S$500 to Anjamal’s Account; and

> b.     On 24 August 2017, Priscilla transferred S$1,450 to Anjamal’s Account.

22.    As payment for the tour to Dubai, Rowena handed over a total sum of S$3,900 to the accused on the following occasions based on instructions given by the accused:

> a.     On 12 July 2017, Rowena transferred S$1,000 to Anjamal’s Account; and

> b.     On 26 August 2017, Rowena transferred S$2,900 to Anjamal’s Account.

23.    As payment for the tour to Dubai, Ramona handed over a total sum of S$1,950 to the accused on the following occasions based on instructions given by the accused:

> a.     On 13 July 2017, Ramona transferred S$500 to Anjamal’s Account; and

> b.     On 25 August 2017, Ramona transferred S$1,450 to Anjamal’s Account.

24.    As payment to the accused for the tour to Dubai, Tricia Yew transferred S$1,950 to Anjamal’s Account on 24 October 2017 based on instructions given by the accused.

25.    On 22 November 2017, the day before the planned date of the trip to Dubai, the accused cancelled the trip. She represented to Ponnumathy, Priscilla, Rowena, Ramona and Tricia Yew that she had to cancel the trip as her mother was hospitalised and in the Intensive Care Unit, which fact she knew to be false.

26.    In particular, on 22 November 2017 at about 4.06 p.m., the accused texted in a group chat with Priscilla, Rowena, Ramona and Tricia Yew the following: “Ladies, I really need ur help. I hv an emergency situation…my mum had a sudden heart attack and is in icu since early this mrng. I waited for her situation to improve to update. Pls I need all ur help to postpone the travel date to 7th Dec as I cannot leave Singapore with her in this condition. I really seek all ur prayers and understanding pls help me to postpone the travel date to 7th Dec. I am very very sorry, sumthg I never expected. Pls help.” In fact, the accused’s mother did not suffer a sudden heart attack and was not in the Intensive Care Unit.

27.    Separately, on 22 November 2017, the accused informed Kalaiselvi that the trip was cancelled as she was required to attend court on 27 November 2017.

28.    When Priscilla, Rowena, Ramona, Tricia Yew and Kalaiselvi pressed the accused for their flight tickets, accommodation and other details so that they could travel to Dubai on their own, the accused was unable to provide any flight tickets, accommodation or other details to them. In fact, the accused had not booked any flight tickets or accommodation or made any other bookings for their trip to Dubai.

29.    In total, between March and October 2017, the accused was entrusted with the sum of S$15,450 by six victims, Kalaiselvi, Ponnumathy, Priscilla, Rowena, Ramona and Tricia Yew, in the course of her business as a freelance travel agent, for the purpose of making bookings for their respective tours to Dubai. Instead, the accused used the monies for her own personal expenses.

## FACTS RELATING TO THE CHARGES UNDER THE TRAVEL AGENTS ACT

33.    From 2013 to 2017, the accused did not fulfil tours to places outside Singapore when she operated as a freelance travel agent.

34.    From 2013 to 2017, the accused offered travel agency services to her clients by selling tours to places outside Singapore. She sought clients in her own capacity and represented that she was a freelance travel agent. The accused accepted payments for the sale of tours.

35.    Hence, the accused carried on the business of a travel agent, as defined under section 4 of the Travel Agents Act, and was not a holder of a licence granted by the STB, as required under section 6 of the Travel Agents Act at the material time when she committed the offences under the Travel Agents Act.

36.    Despite not having the requisite licence to operate as a travel agent, the accused continued to carry on as a freelance travel agent. From 2013 to 2017, the accused misappropriated her clients’ monies and failed to fulfil her obligations to arrange, conduct and make bookings for their respective tours to India and Dubai.

## FACTS RELATING TO THE 6th CHARGE (MAC-900985-2019)

37.    Sometime in or around July 2017, the accused held herself out to Rowena, through her mother, Manoranjitham Esther Margaret Edwards (“Margaret”), as being willing to arrange, conduct and sell a 7 days 6 nights tour to Dubai, including arranging for Rowena and Margaret’s flights and stay at a hotel in Dubai, entitling Rowena and Margaret to travel to Dubai. The accused received a total sum of S$3,900 from Rowena as payment, but failed to so arrange and conduct the tour to Dubai, including arranging for Rowena and Margaret’s rights of passage to and stay at a hotel in Dubai.

## FACTS RELATING TO THE 10th CHARGE (MAC-900989-2019)

38.    Sometime in or around June 2013, the accused held herself out to Nagaletchumy D/O Anamalay (“Nagaletchumy”) as being willing to arrange, conduct and sell a 15 days 14 nights tour to India, including arranging for Nagaletchumy and nine of her family members’ flights and stay at hotels in India, entitling Nagaletchumy and nine of her family members to travel to India. The tour to India was scheduled to be from 21 December 2013 to 4 January 2014. The accused received a total sum of S$17,100 from Nagaletchumy as payment, for the purpose of making bookings for the said tour to India, but failed to so arrange and conduct the tour to India, including arranging for Nagaletchumy and nine of her family members’ rights of passage to and stay at hotels in India.

39.    On 18 December 2013, the accused represented to Nagaletchumy that she had to cancel the trip as her mother was sick and admitted to the hospital, which fact she knew to be false. When Nagaletchumy pressed the accused for her and her family members’ flights tickets so that they could travel to India on their own, the accused was unable to provide any flight tickets. Instead of using the S$17,100 she received from Nagaletchumy to make bookings for the tour to India, the accused used the monies for her own personal expenses.

40.    The Accused has thereby committed three offences under Section 6(1) of the Travel Agents Act, read with Section 4(1)(e), Section 4(1)(b) and Section 4(1)(d) of the same Act, and punishable under section 6(2) of the same Act.

41.    The Accused made full restitution to Nagaletchumy on 20 June 2020.
