Civil Procedure – Limitation – Extension of time to serve writ after limitation period has expired

22 June 2021

### Deputy Registrar Lewis Tan:

1       The Plaintiff and Defendant were involved in a motor vehicle accident on the morning of 18 June 2017. After the accident, correspondence was exchanged between the Plaintiff’s former solicitors and the Defendant’s motor insurers, but parties failed to resolve the matter and the discussions culminated in the insurers rejecting the Plaintiff’s claim in November 2018.

2       The matter stood unaddressed until 15 June 2020, when the Plaintiff instructed his present solicitors from S L Law Chambers (“S L Law”) to take over the conduct of the matter. Acting promptly, S L Law prepared and issued a Writ of Summons on 17 June 2020, just one day before the expiry of the three-year limitation period.

3       Unfortunately, the matter then returned to its dormancy until 29 December 2020, when Mr Nagarajah S Maniam (“Mr Nagarajah”), who had just joined S L Law, took over conduct of the file, and realised that the Writ of Summons had not been served on the Defendant. By this time, the Writ of Summons had expired, and more crucially, the limitation period for the Plaintiff’s claim had also lapsed.

4       Mr Nagarajah then attempted to settle the matter with the Defendant’s insurers, but was stonewalled in the process. Without further recourse, an _ex parte_ application was taken out to renew the Writ of Summons for a further six months, and such application was granted.

5       The reprieve was however short lived, as the Defendant responded shortly thereafter with an application to set aside the order granting the renewal of the Writ of Summons.

6       As _both_ the validity of the writ and the limitation period had expired, the parties were in agreement that the burden was on the Plaintiff to demonstrate first, good reason for the renewal of the writ and secondly, a satisfactory explanation for his failure to apply for an extension of time before the expiry of the writ (_Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Barbrak Ltd and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[1987\] AC 597</span> (“_Kleinwort Benson_”) at 623). Unless such good reason and satisfactory explanation could be provided, the renewal of the Writ of Summons would have to be set aside, and the Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendant would be time-barred.

7       To this, Mr Nagarajah candidly admitted on affidavit that while his firm was aware that the limitation period would expire one day after the Writ of Summons was issued, the Writ of Summons was not served on the Defendant “due to the complication with the \[Defendant’s\] address and as the staff handling the matter was working from home during the Covid situation”. Moreover, “the previous Solicitor and staff handling the matter had already left \[S L Law\]”, such that by the time Mr Nagarajah took over conduct of the matter, the validity of the writ and the limitation period had both expired. In short, the failure to take any steps to serve the writ while it remained valid was simply due to inadvertence on the part of S L Law. Mr Nagarajah explained at the hearing before me that the difficulties were compounded by the fact that his firm was engaged in a move at the material time, and that many staff had left the firm during that period.

8       But, while “\[t\]here have been many cases where the neglect of a solicitor has been called in aid of applications for renewal of a writ”, “\[i\]n very few of those cases have the plaintiffs been successful” (_The “Ching Ho” and another vessel_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 84</span> (“_Ching Ho_”) at \[35\]). Hence, in _Jason Textile Industries Pte Ltd v QBE Insurance (International) Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1988\] 2 SLR(R) 491</span>, it was not a good reason for renewal that the plaintiffs’ solicitors had given erroneous advice that service should be withheld pending the results of investigations. Even the temporary loss of files by the plaintiffs’ solicitors has been held not to justify the exercise of discretion in favour of renewal: _New Ching Kee v Lim Ser Hock_ \[1974-1976\] SLR(R) 49. A rare exception to this line of authorities is _Jones v Jones_ <span class="citation">\[1970\] 2 QB 576</span>, where the English Court of Appeal considered that the misinterpretation of the rules of court by the plaintiff’s solicitor was a reasonable one, and this was good and sufficient reason to extend the time for service of the writ upon the second defendant.

9       While Mr Nagarajah had explained that there was some trouble with obtaining the Defendant’s address for service, it was noteworthy that the Plaintiff’s former solicitors had taken certain steps to locate the address of the Defendant, albeit to no avail. They had also engaged in discussions with the Defendant’s insurers, again to no avail. When the Writ of Summons was issued, S L Law knew of such prior efforts by the former solicitors, and more crucially, that the limitation period was due to expire. However, due to their oversight, no efforts were taken while the writ remained valid to locate the Defendant, such as to check with the Defendant’s insurers whether they knew his address, or to serve the writ on the Defendant through means other than by personal service. Instead, the file was left dormant until both the Writ of Summons and the limitation period had expired.

10     Mr Nagarajah made an impassioned plea about how his client would be severely prejudiced if the renewal of the writ was set aside, as he would then have no recourse against the Defendant. However, in determining whether the renewal is warranted, “the judge is entitled to have regard to the balance of hardship”, including “whether allowing an extension will cause prejudice to the defendant in all the circumstances of the case” (_Kleinwort Benson_ at 623). Here, the Plaintiff had ample opportunity during the three years after the accident and the six months after the writ was issued to serve a Writ of Summons on the Defendant. He did not do so, and the Defendant accordingly obtained an accrued defence of limitation. Were the extension of time for the renewal of the writ granted, the Defendant would lose this accrued defence of limitation, and be put to the trouble of substantively defending the claim even though the limitation period had accrued through no fault of the Defendant. The loss of this defence of limitation was one that could not be compensated by an order of costs, and when considered alongside the fact that the Plaintiff failed to show sufficiently good reason justifying the renewal of the writ, amply shifted the balance in favour of setting aside the order for renewal. Such a conclusion was fortified by the Plaintiff’s failure as well to give a satisfactory explanation for why he failed to apply for an extension of time before the validity of the writ expired, save that his solicitors clearly omitted to give due regard to his file during the subsistence of its validity. For much the same reasons at \[8\]–\[9\] above, I found that this did not rise to the level of a satisfactory explanation.

11     In _Edmund Tie & Co (SEA) Pte Ltd v Savills Residential Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 349</span>, Choo Han Teck J observed, albeit in a different context, that “\[i\]t is substantive law and not procedure that occupies the throne, but one must climb the steps of procedure if he is to pluck the crown” (at \[13\]). Such is the close interplay between the rules of procedure and substantive law – to avail oneself of the rights and remedies that the law may offer, the procedural rules must be closely followed. As the Plaintiff in this case discovered, it does not bode well for one’s chances to point to the hardships that may be suffered as a consequence of falling afoul of the procedural rules, which are very much essential to facilitating the machinery of justice.

12     For the reasons above, the order of court granting the renewal of the Writ of Summons was set aside. Perhaps the only reprieve for the Plaintiff was that the Defendant’s counsel, having had regard to the outcome, asked only for costs of the application to be fixed at $400 (all-in). This sum was more than reasonable given the work done for the application, and I thus fixed costs at $400 (all-in), to be paid by the Plaintiff to the Defendant.
