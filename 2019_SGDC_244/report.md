### District Judge John Ng:

The Public Prosecutor has filed an appeal against the sentences and the Respondents Wong Chee Meng and Chia Sin Lan have filed cross-appeals against their sentences.

2       The offenders had pleaded guilty midway through a trial. I delivered the Judgment on Sentence on 20 November 2019. I have nothing to add to the reasons I had given in that judgment which is reproduced below.

20 November 2019

## JUDGMENT ON SENTENCE

## Introduction

1       This is a Corruption case involving the General Manager (“GM”) of the Ang Mo Kio Town Council (“AMKTC”) between 2014 and 2016.

2       Wong Chee Meng (“Victor Wong”) was an employee of CPG Facilities Management Pte Ltd (“CPG Facilities”) from April 2008 to March 2018. He held the appointment of GM of AMKTC from November 2013 to March 2018. Victor Wong admitted to corruptly receiving and obtaining gratification from Chia Sin Lan. Chia Sin Lan is a Director and Shareholder of two companies, namely, 19-ANC Enterprise Pte Ltd (“19-ANC”) and 19-NS2 Enterprise Pte Ltd (“19-NS2”). The gratifications were to further the interests of these two companies, 19-ANC and 19-NS2, in their business dealings with AMKTC.

## Summary of the acts of Corruption

3       It is vitally important in Corruption cases to identify what exactly the offending acts are which the Court is to pass sentence on. Equally significant is the question of who is being punished.

4       Acts of corruption can occur in circumstances that vary vastly from case to case. There is the simple case of a managing director asking for and accepting a small bribe of $383 as a reward, for showing favour to a printing company in engaging that company to print publicity brochures (_Tan Tze Chye v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 3 SLR(R) 357</span>). He was fined $5,000 and ordered to pay the penalty of $383. At the other end of the scale was the very serious case of a Deputy Chief Executive of the Public Utilities Board receiving more than 13 million dollars over a period of 18 years to show favour to a contractor, for which he was punished with imprisonment terms of 7 years per charge. He received a total sentence of 14 years’ imprisonment (_Choy Hon Tim v PP_ Magistrate’s Appeal 378/95).

5       The Corruption case before us involved the GM of a Town Council corruptly obtaining and receiving gratification from a contractor having business dealings with the Town Council. The gratifications were in the form of a discount connected to the purchase of a car by the GM, remittances of monetary loans to the mistress of the GM, entertainment expenses for the GM, financing the employment of the daughter-in-law of the GM and the free use of a telephone service paid for by the contractor. The time period was from end 2014 to 2016.

6       In some cases of corruption, the gratifications are outright bribes to secure specific contracts. This is not one of them. Instead, this is a case of cultivation by the giver with mutual benefits in mind.

7       Who is Victor Wong that a contractor would want to ply him with gratifications? Victor Wong was the GM of AMKTC, a position which imbued him with certain powers for him to discharge his duties and responsibilities in the running of the operations of the Town Council. A person occupying this senior position carried with him the perceived ability to grant favours to contractors. The two defendant companies are in the business of providing construction services to various town councils in Singapore.

8       One of the key public interests that the law against corruption seeks to protect is the fidelity of the principal-agent relationship or employer-employee relationship in both the public and private sectors. The relationship here is that between the GM Victor Wong and AMKTC. In this relationship, there is the trust reposed in and the duty owed by GM Victor Wong to AMKTC. AMKTC is the statutory body created to carry out works within a residential town to benefit its residents. GM Victor Wong owed a duty to AMKTC to avoid a conflict of interests situation between him and the Town Council.

9       The potential for compromising one’s duties to one’s principal or employer is a key area of concern in the prevention of corruption. The gratifications, specified in the three convicted charges and the two charges taken into consideration for sentencing (“TIC charges”), have the effect of corrupting the relationship of GM Victor Wong and the Town Council to the detriment of its residents.

10     There is no requirement for there to be an actual compromise of one’s duty for the relationship between employer and employee to be corrupted. Where there is an actual compromise of one’s duty, it would be an aggravating factor in sentencing. Any actual detriment or loss suffered would make the acts of corruption more serious or aggravated.

11     It is instructive to look at the CPG Facilities’ Code of Conduct, which is a tool to help officers stay in the clear and remain corrupt-free. Abiding by the Code of Conduct protects both the integrity of the agents or employees and safeguards the interests of the principal or employer. The situations in which the officers sometimes find it awkward, to reject meal invitations or gifts, are resolved by the simple step of disclosure, which would negate any suggestions of corruption or impropriety.

12     It was suggested by counsel that there were innocent intentions behind the gratifications, such as the friendship, which had developed between the giver and the receiver. It might be true that they subsequently became friends but such a suggestion of mixed motives misses the point. The relationship had already been tainted by corrupt intent when the car discount was authorised by Chia Sin Lan, even before they knew each other.

#### Offending acts of Wong Chee Meng

13     The offending acts of Victor Wong are encapsulated in the three charges he pleaded guilty to, together with two TIC charges. The first act of corruption occurred around December 2014, when he asked, through Alisa, for a discount in the purchase of a car that 19-ANC was looking to sell. At this point of time, Chia Sin Lan and Victor Wong did not know each other personally. Alisa discussed the request with Chia Sin Lan and he agreed to sell the car, owned by 19-ANC, to Victor Wong. Chia Sin Lan made the decision as “the directing mind and will” of the company, 19-ANC. After taking into account the purchase of the old car of Victor Wong by 19-NS2, the net effect was the enjoyment of a $13,500 discount by Victor Wong in buying the car from 19-ANC. Chia Sin Lan had authorised these transactions to gain favour for 19-ANC and 19-NS2 with Victor Wong as he was the GM of AMKTC.

14     From May 2015, Chia Sin Lan and Victor Wong started going out for entertainment at KTV Lounges. After going out together on a few occasions, Victor Wong spoke to Chia Sin Lan, at around June 2015, about needing money for the renovation of his mistress’ house in China. Chia Sin Lan agreed to look into it and subsequently remitted RMB 80,000 to Wong’s mistress and did so through an intermediary. Sometime in November 2015, Victor Wong again approached Chia Sin Lan to help his mistress after she had fallen prey to an investment scam. Chia Sin Lan remitted RMB 50,000 to her through the intermediary. In total, Chia Sin Lan had agreed to and remitted the sum of RMB 130,000 to the mistress of Victor Wong in order to advance the business interests of 19-ANC and 19-NS2 with AMKTC.

15     On 29 occasions, between May 2015 and July 2016, Victor Wong and Chia Sin Lan frequented KTV lounges, restaurants, massage spas and a hotel. Chia Sin Lan paid for the expenditure, amounting to a total of S$34,070.04. These expenses were paid by Chia Sin Lan to advance the interests of the two companies.

16     Victor Wong also admitted to two TIC charges. The first TIC charge was in respect of 19-ANC paying the salary of the daughter-in-law of Victor Wong when she was in the employment of 4-Ever Engineering Pte Ltd. The second TIC charge was for accepting the gratification of the free use of a mobile phone line. The phone charges of S$2,527.76 were paid for by 19-ANC.

17     As I had mentioned earlier, this is not a case of the giver asking for a specific favour to be bestowed by the receiver. The gravamen of Victor’s acts of corruption is in knowingly receiving the benefits given with corrupt intent by Chia Sin Lan, representing 19-ANC and 19-NS2, with the objective of advancing their business dealings with AMKTC.

18      _Victor had allowed himself to be cultivated_ by a contractor. It started with Victor asking for and receiving a discount in the purchase of a car owned by 19-ANC. This was followed by Victor’s request in June 2015 for Chia Sin Lan to help financially with the renovation of the house of Victor’s mistress in China. This first request for financial assistance in relation to his mistress occurred very early on, after just getting acquainted with Chia Sin Lan. Later in November 2015, Victor made a second request for financial help for his mistress that Chia Sin Lan again obliged. Throughout the period from May 2015 to July 2016, arising from the frequenting of entertainment outlets by the both of them (occasionally with others), Chia Sin Lan incurred expenses amounting to S$34,070.04. As a result of the gratifications, which was intended by Chia Sin Lan to advance the business interests of 19-ANC and 19-NS2, _Victor Wong became beholden to Chia Sin Lan and the two companies_.

19     As the General Manager of AMKTC, Victor Wong was the overall in-charge of the operations of the Town Council. As spelt out in the admitted Joint Statement of Facts, his duties included overseeing and providing his inputs on the selection of contractors for works at AMKTC. Victor was also privy to important contract information and was also able to attend meetings where contractors were recommended and selected for projects and works at AMKTC. As GM of AMKTC, he was in charge of a team of contract managers who see to the process of evaluating tenders and quotations of contractors looking to carry out works for AMKTC. The Prosecution had included in the Joint Statement of Facts, instances where Victor had intervened in the award of tenders and ITQs (Invitation To Quote) by AMKTC to 19-ANC and 19-NS2. These are found in Paragraphs 40 to 43 of the Joint Statement of Facts and I will not repeat them here.

#### Offending acts of Chia Sin Lan

20     Chia Sin Lan’s acts of corruption as a giver corresponded to Victor Wong’s acts of corruption as a receiver. As mentioned earlier, Chia Sin Lan is the “directing mind and will” of the two companies 19-ANC and 19-NS2. The objective of the gratifications was to further the business interests of these companies in their business dealings with AMKTC. What is wrong in Chia Sin Lan trying to promote the business as a director and shareholder of these two companies?

21     The wrongfulness is in the use of corrupt means. By Chia Sin Lan’s corrupt acts of authorising the discount for the sale of the car to Victor Wong on account of him being the GM of AMKTC, providing the funds to the mistress of Victor Wong and spending much time and money entertaining him with the intention of cultivating him, _Chia Sin Lan was providing an inducement for GM Victor Wong to compromise his integrity_ in the discharge of his duties as an officer of AMKTC. Chia Sin Lan was also fostering, through Victor Wong, an unfair advantage in the business dealings of the two companies with AMKTC vis-à-vis other contractors seeking to do business with AMKTC. Additionally, the financial resources for these gratifications would have to come from the companies and these would ultimately find its way into the costing of any projects carried out for AMKTC.

#### Offending acts of the corporate entities

22     The corporate entities 19-ANC and 19-NS2 are to be punished for being in a criminal conspiracy to commit corruption. These companies are being held responsible because their managing director, acting for them, had contravened the laws against corruption. The acts of Chia Sin Lan are being attributed to the companies as he had carried out the corrupt acts for the purposes of furthering the business interests of the two companies.

## Summary of the Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

23     The Prosecution team has put up several comprehensive Submissions on Sentence in this case. It is impossible to replicate all that they wish to convey in a summary. This is only a roundup of the main thrusts of their submissions.

24     The Prosecution submitted that the dominant sentencing principle in this case is General Deterrence. To achieve that, after taking into account the various aggravating factors, they submitted for an aggregate sentence of imprisonment of at least 56 months (4 years and 8 months) for Victor Wong and 50 months (4 years and 2 months) for Chia Sin Lan. For the two companies, the Prosecution is seeking the maximum fines of $100,000 each.

25     According to the Prosecution, the gravamen of the corruption offences committed in this case is the erosion of trust of the institution of Town Councils, a unique and important aspect of governance in Singapore. The Prosecution submitted that in view of the growth in the scale and scope of the responsibilities of Town Councils since its inception, absolute probity is demanded of all officers and employees of Town Councils. According to the Prosecution, the offences in this case had created a great deal of public disquiet.

26     The Prosecution highlighted several aggravating factors. Common to both Victor Wong and Chia Sin Lan are the triggering of the public service rationale, the sustained and persistent manner of offending, the substantial benefit as a result of the corruption and the high value of the gratification. On an individual level, there was a clear abuse of trust by Victor Wong as the GM of AMKTC. For Chia Sin Lan, there was a high level of premeditation and concealment of the offences.

## Summary of the Mitigation and Submissions on Sentence by Defence Counsel

27     Although Victor Wong and Chia Sin Lan (together with 19-ANC and 19-NS2) are represented by two different sets of Defence Counsel, there were some common features in their separate Pleas in Mitigation.

28     The first common feature submitted by both counsel is the presence of a friendship underlying their mutual interactions. This apparent friendship shared between Victor Wong and Chia Sin Lan led to their involvement in the corrupt acts. I used the word apparent because it is clear from the admitted Joint Statement of Facts that this friendship cannot be applicable to all the charges they had pleaded guilty to. Specifically, when Chia Sin Lan authorised the discount for the car transactions, he had not been introduced to Victor Wong yet. When Victor asked Chia Sin Lan, in June 2015, for money to renovate his mistress’ house in China, they had only gone out for meals together on a few occasions prior to this first request for financial help. Although Victor regarded Chia Sin Lan as a close friend at the latter stages, Chia Sin Lan regarded Victor less so. Chia Sin Lan saw Victor more as a GM to be entertained rather than as a friend.

29     The second common feature submitted on their behalf is that there was no compromise of Victor Wong’s duties in his role as the GM of AMKTC. There was no evidence that any contract awarded to 19-ANC or 19-NS2 was unmeritorious or unfair. The awards of contracts were carried out in accordance with the established protocols, many of which were conducted publicly. There was no direct correlation between any contract awarded and the gratifications received by Victor Wong from Chia Sin Lan. The third common feature highlighted is that there was no harm or damage suffered by AMKTC as a result of these acts of corruption.

30     Next, I move on to the specific mitigation on behalf of each offender.

#### On behalf of Wong Chee Meng

31     A key point made in the Plea of Mitigation submitted by Counsel for Victor Wong is that he was never motivated by personal greed. It was suggested that this was a blurring of the line between the personal and professional lives of Victor Wong and Chia Sin Lan over time. They were two middle-aged men, who were close personal friends as well as business associates, having fun with wine and women outside of work, eventually overstepping boundaries.

32     Counsel submitted that Victor largely received the gratification on the basis of his friendship with Chia Sin Lan but accepted that there was an objective corrupt element in the gratification as an inducement or reward and that Victor had received the gratification with a guilty knowledge. It was also submitted that Victor and Chia Sin Lan took turns to pay for the entertainment expenditure incurred by them throughout the relevant period of the offences. Copies of Victor’s credit card statements were tendered as evidence of these payments amounting in total to S$16,382.23.

33     The counsel submitted that Victor’s offences were a one-off indiscretion. This was Victor’s first brush with the law. Victor has always been an upright individual devoted to serving the community and his conduct in this case is entirely inconsistent with his character. Victor’s involvement in the events pertaining to the charges only began after he had experienced difficulties in his marriage. Victor’s lapse in judgment was a result of his marital problems. This lapse, after a sterling career spanning over 30 years, demonstrated that it was a one-off mistake.

34     Counsel accepted that Victor held a position of authority in AMKTC but submitted that this was not a case that he had abused his position for the purpose of receiving gratification. In fact, Victor had limited powers as GM of AMKTC. In respect of decisions on the awarding of tenders, Victor had no powers as such decisions had to be made in accordance with strict protocols put in place to safeguard the process.

#### On behalf of Chia Sin Lan

35     The counsel for Chia Sin Lan submitted that whatever punishment is to be meted out, it should not be excessive and crushing in light of the unusual circumstances in this case. The counsel prepared a timeline of events leading up to and including the separate incidents of gratification. They seek to show the context and background to the events in order to give a fuller perspective of the offending acts.

36     It was not in dispute and Chia Sin Lan had admitted that taking Victor Wong out for that many dinners, to the KTV lounges and spas would make Victor beholden to him. However, the relationship between Chia Sin Lan and Victor cannot be characterised as one of purely corrupt gratification. Chia Sin Lan never asked Victor for help and Victor never offered help. Counsel also highlighted that there were genuine friendships amongst the parties, including Alisa and Tay Eng Chuan, by referring to their communications in the form of messages exchanged by the parties.

37     In view of the instances of Victor’s intervention being cited in the Joint Statement of Facts, the counsel for Chia Sin Lan had painstakingly included, in their written submissions, their perspectives on these interventions. In the main, the counsel sought to show that these interventions should not be seen as Victor somehow pulling the strings behind the scenes. The counsel pointed out that the structure and set-up of the management of the AMKTC is known to those within the industry. Although Victor was the GM, he was not involved in the awarding of contracts, whether by open tender, or by invitation to quote. There were stringent and strict procedures, open processes to ensure that the awards were solely and purely on merit.

#### On behalf of the corporate entities

38     On behalf of the two companies, the counsel submitted that they were not solely dependent on contracts from AMKTC. Like any other companies bidding for Town Council contracts, they were at times successful and at other times unsuccessful. They were never guaranteed any contracts. For each bid, the two companies presented a competitive bid backed by a good track record and worked hard to make sure that their contracts were awarded based on merit. There was no evidence that any contract was wrongly awarded to them.

39     As for the allegedly tainted projects pointed out by the Prosecution, the counsel strongly stressed that everything was done by committee and approved according to internal procedures. It was highly misleading to suggest that Victor Wong had somehow influenced the awarding of these open tender contracts. There is no evidence at all to substantiate such a claim. 19-ANC had established for itself a credible and impressive track record of undertaking and completing R&R works. The counsel had enclosed copies of the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) Performance Records issued by the various Town Councils for which 19-ANC had done projects for.

## High Court Guidance on Corruption Cases

40     Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon had laid down the general approach to sentencing for Section 6(a) Prevention of Corruption Act (“PCA”) offences in the case of **_PP v Marzuki bin Ahmad_** <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 623</span> (“_Marzuki’s case_”). When sentencing for such offences, it would be relevant to have regard to the following non-exhaustive list of factors:

> (a)     Whether the offence was committed by a public servant.

> (b)     What the value of the gratification was.

> (c)     The nature of the offender’s corrupt acts and the seriousness of the consequences of those acts to the public interest.

> (d)     The offender’s seniority and position within the organisation which is his principal for the purposes of s 6(a), and the nature of the duty owed to that organisation, which duty was compromised by the offender’s corrupt act.

> (e)     The level of control enjoyed by the offender over whether any action would be taken or forborne to be taken as a result of his corrupt act.

41     In the case of **_Tjong Mark Edward v PP_** <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 375</span>, Justice Tay Yong Kwang distilled the following factors from _Marzuki’s case_ and the case of **_PP v Ang Seng Thor_** <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 217</span> (“_Ang Seng Thor_”):

> (a)     The seniority of the accused, the nature of the duty owed to the principal or the level of control enjoyed by the accused.

> (b)     The gravity of the offence as measured by the duty compromised or the mischief or the likely consequence of the corruption.

> (c)     The size of the bribes.

> (d)     The number of people drawn into the web of corruption.

> (e)     Whether such conduct was endemic, was systematic or occurred over a long period of time.

> (f)     Any applicable policy considerations.

42     Also in the case of _Ang Seng Thor_, V K Rajah JA expounded on the sentencing factor of the “public service rationale” as referring to the public interest in preventing a loss of confidence in Singapore’s public administration. This sentencing factor is presumed to apply where the offender is a government servant or an officer of a public body, but it may also apply to private sector offenders where the subject matter of the offence involves a public contract or a public service.

43     The most recent High Court guidance on the sentencing of Corruption cases was provided by Justice Hoo Sheau Peng on 6 September 2019. After hearing the appeal cases of _PP v Tan Kok Ming, Michael_ (MA 9187/2018) and _PP v Gursharan Kaur Sharon Rachael_ (MA 9200/2019) together, Justice Hoo delivered her judgment of <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 207</span>. For our purposes, Hoo, J held, _inter alia_, that it was not appropriate to formulate a general sentencing framework for Sections 5 and 6 of the PCA offences. She was not convinced that the courts have not been using the full range of sentences as prescribed. She reiterated, as drawn from previous High Court pronouncements on Corruption cases, that Corruption offences are diverse and complex in nature. Quoting the words of the Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon in the case of _PP v Syed Mostofa Romel_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 1166</span>, she said that “sentencing, especially in the context of corruption, is an intensely factual exercise”.

44     Justice Hoo re-stated that the main overarching sentencing considerations in corruption cases are deterrence and retribution and the courts have recognised numerous offence-specific factors relevant to sentencing. These include the value of the gratification, the consequences of the corruption, the motivation of the offender, the web of corruption, the extent of premeditation and sophistication, the duration of the offending, the role of the offender, etc.

## The Applicable Sentencing Factors

45     The relevant sentencing factors which are applicable to this case are:

> (a)     The triggering of the public service rationale.

> (b)     The seniority and position of the receiver within the organisation.

> (c)     The high level of control enjoyed by the receiver.

> (d)     The size of the gratification amounting to a total of about $86,000.

> (e)     The motivation of the offenders.

> (f)     The extent of premeditation and concealment by the giver.

> (g)     Mitigating Factors.

46     The triggering of the public service rationale is obvious in this case. I agree with the submissions of the Prosecution that although the appointed managing agent of the Town Council is a private company, the public sector rationale has been triggered as CPG Facilities exercised some of the powers and performed some of the functions and duties of the statutory body.

47     Next, it is clear that the present case involved the corruption of a person of a high level of seniority. In fact, the receiver of the gratification is occupying the top position of GM, in charge of the operations of the AMKTC. The giver of the gratification is well aware of the receiver’s authority and overall control of the operations within the organisation. It is axiomatic that corruption occurring higher up the hierarchy in an organisation or involving a person with a higher level of control would add to the seriousness of the offence.

48     As for the size of the gratification, although the total is about $86,000, the proper way to account for the size of the gratification is by considering the amount involved in each of the charges. For the charge involving the car discount, the amount is $13,500 and this is a substantial sum but not a huge sum. For the charge of the remittances, the combined sums of the two remittances came up to RMB 130,000, which is the equivalent of about just below $28,000. This amount is large but it was given as a loan and should not be seen in the same light as an outright payment sum to Victor Wong. The charge involving the entertainment expenses of about $34,000 again seems large. However, it ought to be borne in mind that the aggregate sum had arisen out of 29 occasions between May 2015 and July 2016, a period of time of slightly more than a year. It was also accepted by the Prosecution that Victor Wong’s portion of the aggregate sum could be fairly set at about $7,000, since he was not the sole beneficiary of these entertainment expenses.

49     Other than the aforesaid common factors applicable to all the offenders, the specific sentencing factors applicable to Victor Wong are:

> (a)     Being the initiator of the discount for the purchase of the car from 19-ANC through Alisa, as well as being the one who had asked Chia Sin Lan to provide financial help for his mistress in China.

> (b)     The interventions made by Victor Wong, as spelt out by the Prosecution in the Joint Statement of Facts, which showed that there was a flagrant abuse and breach of trust on his part.

> (c)     The betrayal by Victor of the trust of the Town Council as its GM. Furthermore, as the Prosecution had put it, his corrupt acts were particularly reprehensible given that he, being well acquainted with the Code of Conduct, had reminded his staff of the need to stay corrupt-free in their dealings with contractors. Instead of setting a positive example as their supervisor, he had acted hypocritically and indulged in the corrupting activities.

50     The mitigating factors for Victor are:

> (a)     First brush with the law and having an exemplary career.

> (b)     Pleaded guilty, albeit after trial had started.

> (c)     Cooperated fully with the authorities.

51     I was not able to give weight to the other mitigating factors cited by the counsel for Victor. It was submitted that there was no greed involved but that goes against the grain of the charges. Seeking financial gain in the form of a discount for the purchase of the car and asking for financial help for his mistress in China must surely be seen as greed.

52     In relation to the paying of other entertainment expenses on Victor’s part, that would not reduce his culpability. Victor might have paid out of goodwill when both of them went out to enjoy themselves but Chia Sin Lan’s payments were laced with a corrupt intent for which Victor knew full well he was not allowed to receive or at least he ought to have done so with disclosure to his organisation. In any event, Victor knew that he would be beholden to Chia Sin Lan after receiving gratifications from him.

53     It was submitted that Victor’s offences were one-off indiscretion. I would take it that what the counsel was trying to convey was that these offences were to be seen as one single lapse of judgment in his life. It would be incorrect to regard the offences committed by Victor in this case to be a one-off incident.

54     Moving on to the sentencing factors specific to Chia Sin Lan. I agree with the Prosecution that there was clear premeditation on the part of Chia Sin Lan in the way he went about cultivating GM Victor Wong in order to further the business interests of the two companies of which he was the boss.

55     I also agree with the submissions that Chia Sin Lan had taken steps to conceal his gratifications to Victor Wong. There was the use of an intermediary for the transfer of monies to China for Victor’s mistress and the use of a handwritten secret ledger of accounts. I accept the submissions of the Prosecution that these acts of concealment should be taken as an aggravating factor.

56     The same mitigating factors of pleading guilty and having no relevant antecedents are applicable to Chia Sin Lan.

## The Calibrated Sentences

57     The dominant sentencing principle in this case is Deterrence. The offences are punishable with an imprisonment of up to 7 years and a fine of up to $100,000 per charge. Adopting the general approach to sentencing in corruption cases outlined in _Marzuki’s case_, as well as the approach utilised by Justice Hoo of articulating and clarifying the factors for consideration by sentencing courts, I calibrated the sentences for each of the offenders as follows. I will start with the two companies.

#### Maximum Fines for the Companies?

58     Prosecution had submitted for the maximum fines to be imposed on each of the two companies of $100,000 per charge. They had based this submission on the large amount of gratifications and the substantial benefit to 19-ANC and 19-NS2, which they calculated to be over S$9 million worth of revenue gained from the contracts for works with AMKTC.

59     I am unable to agree with the submissions that the two companies had illegally obtained millions in revenue for works done for AMKTC. There is no evidence or basis to say that the contracts awarded for these works had been obtained due to Victor Wong’s influence in the granting of the contracts to the two companies. On the contrary, the defence counsel were able to show in their submissions that the two companies were awarded these contracts through open tenders. The interventions of Victor Wong, carefully highlighted by the Prosecution, did not reveal any direct links of favours or other machinations by Victor Wong to affect or interfere with the due process of tender, evaluation and the awards of these contracts.

60     There is no evidence to show that the protocols and processes set in place for the awarding of contracts by the Town Council were not intact. There was no basis to suggest that these measures had been compromised by the corruption on the part of Victor Wong and Chia Sin Lan. Although Victor was also the Secretary of the Town Council, the decisions on the award of the contracts were made by the Estate Maintenance Committee (“EMC”). The acts of gratification might have cast suspicions but that is a separate matter to be taken into account under potential harm or harm to the AMKTC in terms of the erosion of trust of the institution of the Town Councils, an important aspect of governance in Singapore.

61     I accept the submissions of the counsel for both the companies that their business and profits were not solely from projects with AMKTC. The counsel had provided fairly comprehensive information in their submissions to back up their arguments on this point, as well as showed that these two companies failed as much as other contractors in their bids for projects with AMKTC.

62     19-ANC and 19-NS2 had pleaded guilty and been convicted of a single charge each. I hereby impose a sentence of a fine of $75,000 each. The aggregate fine of $150,000 imposed on the two companies had been calibrated based on the total amount of gratification involved of about $86,000. Usually, a giver of gratification is prepared to part with a smaller sum of money as a bribe because the giver is expecting a larger windfall in return. On such a basis, it would be reasonable to impose a fine significantly higher than the gratification given. As to how much higher, it would depend on the assessment of relevant aggravating and mitigating factors.

63     I find that the offences of corruption here involving these two companies, in terms of the amounts and the scale involved, to be moderate and not deserving of the maximum fines. The scale involved is measured by the size and reach of the company, the number of people within the company caught in the web of corruption and the presence of a corrupt culture in the company. These two companies are moderate in size and the number of people caught in the web of corruption are few.

64     I am fully aware that the Prosecution had suggested the imposition of the maximum sentences in view of the huge contract sums awarded to the two companies which they submitted were tainted with corruption. As mentioned previously, I had found no evidence or basis to infer that the contract sums awarded for these works done for AMKTC were obtained due to Victor Wong granting favours to these companies. Since there is no evidential links of the corrupt acts to the awarding of the contracts by AMKTC to these companies, I find myself unable to justify the maximum monetary punishment.

#### Wong Chee Meng – How much is sufficient punishment?

65     I move on now to the sentence for Victor Wong Chee Meng. He had pleaded guilty to three charges with two other charges to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. I proceed to calibrate the sentence in two stages. The first stage is to determine the sentence for each offence. This is necessary as the context of the gratification for each convicted charge varies significantly. I start with the gratification of the discount for the purchase of the car.

66     The amount involved here is $13,500. This is a one-off discount arising from the purchase of Victor Wong of a car belonging to 19-ANC and the sale of his car to 19-NS2. The overall effect was a difference of $13,500 to the benefit of Victor Wong and this formed the gratification amount.

67     The Prosecution suggested 18 or 20 months while the Defence proposed 3 months. My calibration of the sentence for this offence is 12 months’ imprisonment. I noted from a cursory survey of the cases of sentencing precedents for corruption offences in the _Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts of the Practitioners’ Library_, Third Edition Volume II, that there is a range of imprisonment of between 6 to 12 months for gratification sums of between $5,000 to $15,000. This is only a very rough range, bearing in mind the different factual circumstances of each case. Nevertheless, a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment for this offence would, in my view, appropriately account for all the relevant factors applicable to this case as set out in Paragraph 45 to Paragraph 53 above.

68     For the remittance charge, the amount of gratification is about $27,800. The Prosecution submitted for an imprisonment of 24 or 27 months. The Defence suggested a term of 6 months. My assessment is one of 15 months to account for the relevant applicable factors mentioned in Paragraph 45 to Paragraph 53. Although the amount is about twice the car discount, it has to be borne in mind that this amount was a loan.

69     For the entertainment expenses charge, the amount of gratification is about $34,000 of which the portion of personal benefit to Victor Wong is about $7,000. Prosecution submitted for imprisonment of 29 or 32 months. The Defence pegged it at 8 months. Although the amount of $34,000 is the largest sum of the amounts of gratification involved in the three convicted charges, it has been accepted by the Prosecution, and rightly so, that the proportion of the benefit of these entertainment expenses for Victor Wong came up to $7,000.

70     In view of the nature of the entertainment expenses offence, comprising 29 occasions over the span of 14 months, the amount of gratification of $34,070.04, specified in the charge, cannot be the determinative factor of the sentence for this charge. Instead, my focus for the sentencing of this offence is in terms of the length of time and the numerous occasions the giver Chia Sin Lan had spent cultivating the receiver Victor Wong. This forms the gravamen of this charge and the $34,000 is a reflection of the aggregation of those efforts. My calibration of the sentence for this offence is an imprisonment term of 12 months.

71     As to the running of the sentences of imprisonment, the starting point must be that imprisonment sentences for different and distinct offences ought to run consecutively. In the present case, the three offences could be considered distinct in that they involved three different types of gratification occurring on separate occasions. They might be distinct in that sense but to run all of them consecutively would be excessive, bearing in mind the gratifications were all given for the same corrupt purpose of furthering the business interests of the two companies with AMKTC. The three offences for sentencing touched on the same public interests to be protected. Therefore, ordering the running of two of these three sentences, in compliance with Section 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (“CPC”) the CPC would be sufficient punishment.

72     The sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment for the car discount offence and the sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment for the remittances offence will run consecutively for a total of 27 months’ imprisonment. The sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment for the entertainment expenses offence will run concurrently.

73     Punishment must fit the offence and the offender. Victor Wong had worked his way up to the position of GM of a Town Council - a position of authority and responsibility. He has committed a grave mistake by succumbing to corruption and fallen from grace. He must now face the consequences of his actions and serve a prison sentence in the next two and a quarter years of his life. In my view, the total sentence of imprisonment of 27 months is long enough to deter others in similar positions of authority and responsibility from committing similar transgressions. Such a sentence is severe enough, without over-punishing, to remind us, as aptly put by the Prosecution in their submissions, that “absolute probity is demanded of all officers and employees of Town Councils”. The sentence also signals clearly our zero tolerance for corruption in general and corruption that undermines public administration in particular.

#### Chia Sin Lan – Should he suffer the same punishment?

74     The starting point for the giver and the receiver of a corrupt gratification is that they ought to receive the same punishment. However, where there are material factors showing a different level of culpability or some extenuating circumstances, such as when the giver is pressurised by threats of harm from the receiver into giving, then a different sentence would be justified.

75     In the present case, for the car discount charge, the request emanated from Victor Wong. Chia Sin Lan had not even met him at this stage. Chia could have turned down the request but decided to accede to it and gave directions for the car transactions to proceed. I would place a higher culpability on the part of Victor Wong for initiating this offence and therefore calibrated a lower sentence for this charge against Chia Sin Lan at 9 months’ imprisonment.

76     For the charge involving the remittances, I would, for the same reason that it was Victor Wong who had initiated the offence when he asked Chia Sin Lan to help his mistress financially in China twice, calibrate the sentence for Chia Sin Lan at a lower term of 12 months’ imprisonment. As for the entertainment expenses charge, both of them were equally culpable. Therefore, he should face the same punishment of 12 months’ imprisonment. As for the running of the sentences, the sentence for the car discount offence and the sentence for the offence involving the entertainment expenses are to run consecutively, giving a total of 21 months’ imprisonment. The sentence for the remittances offence is to run concurrently.

## The Section 13 Penalty against Victor Wong

77     I agree with the submissions of the Prosecution on the total amount of penalty to be paid by Victor Wong under Section 13 of the PCA. I hereby order that Victor Wong is to pay the sum of $23,398.09 (in default one month’s imprisonment) made up of the following sums:

> (a)     $13,500 car discount.

> (b)     $7,370.33 in respect of the gratification received in the form of entertainment.

> (c)     $2,527.76 being the amount of the phone bills paid by 19-ANC.
