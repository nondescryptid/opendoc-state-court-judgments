3       The Accused admitted and consented to having three other charges taken into consideration for purposes of sentencing. These offences were: for using abusive language against a police officer under section 6(1)(a) POHA, disorderly behaviour under section 20 MOA and using criminal force under section 352 of the Penal Code.

4       This is the Accused’s appeal against sentence.

## Facts

5       The Statements of Facts revealed these details.

### Facts pertaining to MAC 902656/2020 (Disorderly Behaviour) and DAC 905978/2020 (Criminal Intimidation)

6       Investigations revealed that, on 25 July 2019, at about 2 am, the Accused went to Club Platinum located at Lucky Plaza with a group of friends. While in the club, they drank 2 bottles of whisky and a bottle of gin. The Accused was intoxicated. At about 5.22 am, Police Staff Sergeant Lock Kang Wei (“Sgt Lock”) (along with his partner Sgt Michelle Ong) arrived at the roadside of Nutmeg Road, behind Lucky Plaza, 304 Orchard Road, Singapore, and spotted one of the Accused’s friends acting aggressively and shouting. He was not wearing a shirt and throwing punches into the air. The officers asked him to calm down but he did not heed their warnings. The officers also heard and saw the Accused shouting loudly and gesticulating his hands.

7       At about 5.24 am, Sgt Lock advised the Accused to calm down. However, the Accused did not heed Sgt Lock’s advice and continued to behave in a disorderly manner. As police officers were effecting the arrest of another male, the Accused, who claimed to be a friend of the person being arrested approached the officers aggressively. The officers managed to move the Accused away from the other male. However, he remained uncooperative and was aggressive towards the officers. The Accused pointed his finger at Sgt Lock and threatened to cause death to Sgt Lock by saying “Sir, I make sure I murder you.” He did so with intent to cause alarm to Sgt Lock.

### Facts pertaining to MAC 902659/2020 (Section 6(1)(a) Protection from Harassment Act)

8       On 28 July 2019 at about 6.09 am, a caller provided the following message to the Police: “7 people fighting, I can’t see if got weapon or not we see from CCTV”. The location given was Apt Blk 5 Koek Road Cuppage Plaza Singapore 228796.

9       Volunteer Special Constabulary Sergeant Ken Chua Zhi Ren (“Sgt Ken”), a Police Officer attached to Orchard Neighbourhood Police Centre and his partner subsequently arrived at the incident location. They spotted a commotion involving several subjects outside Cuppage Plaza. The scene was chaotic with multiple persons behaving in a rowdy manner. The Accused was intoxicated (he had drunk 10 glasses of mixed liquor) and was shouting aggressively and challenging other persons to fight. He then took off his t-shirt and tried to charge other people in the vicinity. Sgt Ken intervened and told him to put on his shirt. The Accused did not comply and continued to shout in an incomprehensible manner, behaving rowdily and shouting vulgarities. The officers effected arrest.

10     After Sgt Ken and his partner effected arrest and while transferring the accused to the police vehicle, the Accused starting using vulgarities on Sgt Ken. Despite being warned repeatedly not to do so by Sgt Ken, the Accused continued using abusive words on him during the journey on board the police vehicle from Kramat Road to Tanglin Divisional Headquarters located at 21 Kampong Java Road, Singapore (this took place from 6:17 am to 6:20 am). The Accused’s abusive words included the following:

> (a)     “Chee bye la. You all na bei chee bye you all” in a mixture of English and Hokkien, which means “Cunt. You all your mother’s cunt you all”;

> (b)     “Chee bye eh, you all officers eh go protect them la” in a mixture of English and Hokkien, which means “Cunt eh, you all officer eh go protect them la”;

> (c)     “You all lanjiao” in a mixture of English and Hokkien, which means “You all penis”;

> (d)     “If another motherfucker thing happened, its because is your own fucking Tanglin and Cantonment okay. Alpha and Echo”;

> (e)     “Okay, motherfucking Alpha and Echo is the reason whyanother murder going to happen”;

> (f)     “Fucking Tanglin dog”;

> (g)     “You all wear blue colour big fuck meh”;

> (h)     “Lanjiao bin big fuck” in a mixture of English and Hokkien, which means “Penis face big fuck”; and

> (i)     “Go and talk ration first la, lanjiao” in a mixture of English and Hokkien, which means “Go and talk ration first la, penis”

### Facts pertaining to MAC 902660/2020 (Disorderly Behaviour) and MAC 902661/2020 (Voluntarily Causing Hurt)

11     On 22 November 2019, at about 6:15 pm, one Sadaiyamuthu Venkatesan, male, Indian, 39 years old (“the victim”) called the Police and provided the following message: “One person he hantam me”. The incident location provided was Apt Blk 441 Commonwealth Avenue West 120441.

12     Investigations revealed that on 22 November 2019, at about 6.00 pm, the victim alighted from bus service number 99 at 441C Commonwealth Ave West, Clementi Bus Interchange. As the victim was walking inside the bus interchange, the Accused bumped into him. The bump was very hard. The victim asked the Accused what happened, and the Accused became aggressive. The victim tried to call for the police and the Accused shoved the handphone out of the victim’s hand and punched the victim twice; once on the left side of the victim’s face and once on the right side of the victim’s face. The staff at the bus interchange, including one Mr Lim Poh Boon (the assistant interchange supervisor), intervened and tried to separate the parties.

13     A witness, one Lim Jing Hao spotted the Accused shouting loudly and hurling vulgarities at the victim. Lim Jing Hao saw Mr Lim Poh Boon try to calm the Accused down to no avail. Lim Jing Hao approached the Accused, who was intoxicated. The Accused continued to be rowdy and aggressive. He told Lim Jing Hao that if he (Lim Jing Hao) let the victim go, he would beat the victim up and murder him. He continually threatened to harm him. He was then arrested by the Police.

14     The victim sought medical treatment and was assessed to have sustained tenderness on his face and wrist. The victim was not warded for his injuries.

## Antecedents

15     The Accused is untraced.

## Mitigation

16     Learned counsel helpfully summarised his position at the start of his mitigation plea[^1].

17     Notwithstanding that the Accused was above the age of 21 at the time of the offences and of sentencing, counsel submitted that a sentence that places emphasis on rehabilitation would be appropriate. This was on the basis that the Accused demonstrated an extremely strong propensity for reform:

> (a)     He had demonstrated a positive desire to change since the commission of the offences;

> (b)     There were conditions in the Accused’s life that were conducive to helping him turn over a new leaf;

> (c)     There were no identifiable risk factors.

18     Defence’s main submission was that rehabilitation retained primacy in this case and a term of probation would be appropriate. It was submitted that a sentence which did not remove the Accused from the support system that his family provides him and risk derailing the progress that he has made since the commission of the offences, would be best suited. Counsel added that a stint of incarceration might increase the Accused’s risk of being subject to negative influences which may be detrimental to his rehabilitation and increase his risk of re-offending. Learned counsel urged the Court to call for a pre-sentence probation suitability report to assess the Accused’s suitability for a term of probation.

19     Alternatively, the Defence submitted for a global sentence of not more than three months and 12 days’ imprisonment.

## Prosecution’s Sentencing Position

20     Prosecution objected to the calling of a pre-sentence probation suitability report. Instead, the learned Deputy Public Prosecutor sought a sentence of four months’ imprisonment on the charge of criminal intimidation under section 506 of the Penal Code, three weeks’ imprisonment on the POHA charge and fines on the charge of causing hurt under section 323 of the Penal Code as well as on each of the charges of disorderly behaviour[^2].

## Decision on Sentence

21     I declined to call for a pre-sentence probation suitability report.

### Rehabilitation is not the dominant sentencing consideration for adult offenders

22     At the time of the commission of the offences, the Accused was already an adult, one of 24 years old. At the time of sentencing, he was 25 years of age. For offenders of his age, probation was the exception rather than the norm.

23     Even though it is acknowledged there is no _“aged-based restriction….. so long as the offender does not fall within the proviso to that provision (in other words, so long as the offender is not convicted of an offence for which a specific minimum sentence or mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment or fine or caning is prescribed by law)”_, the Honourable Chief Justice Menon in _A Karthik v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 1289</span> (“_Karthik_”) 114  went on to say at \[33\]:

> _That said, the age of an offender is nonetheless a critical factor in the court’s determination of whether an offender should be granted probation in lieu of imprisonment. This is because  probation as a sentencing option places rehabilitation at the front and centre of the court’s deliberation (Public Prosecutor v Koh Wen Jie Boaz <span class="citation">\[2016\] 1 SLR 334</span> (“Boaz Koh”) at \[35\], citing Public Prosecutor v Mohammad Al-Ansari bin Basri \[2008\] 1 SLR (R) 449 (“Al-Ansari”) at \[41\] – \[43\]), and rehabilitation as a sentencing principle generally takes precedence when the court is dealing with youthful offenders (Public Prosecutor v Lim Chee Yin Jordon \[2018\] SHGC 46 (“Jordon Lim”) at \[30\], citing Public Prosecutor v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice \[1998\] 3 SLR (R) (“Maurice Mok”) at \[21\]). Indeed, the law takes a presumptive view that where youthful offenders are concerned, the primary sentencing consideration is rehabilitation: Public Prosecutor v Lim Cheng Ji Alvin <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 671</span> (“Alvin Lim”) at \[6\], cited in Jordon Lim at \[3\]._

24     At \[34\] of _A Karthik_, it was made clear_:_

> _In contrast, the presumption that the dominant sentencing consideration is rehabilitation does _not _apply to adult offenders, that is to say, offenders who are above the age of 21: Alvin Lim at \[7\]. Instead, rehabilitation would only be regarded as the operative consideration when sentencing adult offenders if the particular offender concerned “demonstrates an extremely strong propensity for reform _and/or there are _exceptional circumstances warranting the grant of probation_”: _Goh Lee Yin _at \[28\], cited in _Jordan Lim _at _\[33\]. In short, the archetype of the appropriate candidate for probation is the young amateur” offender ( Sim Wen Yi Ernest v Public Prosecutor <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 207</span> (“ Ernest Sim ”) at \[27\]_, citing _Lim Li Ling v Public Prosecutor <span class="citation">\[2007\] 1 SLR(R) 165</span> at \[87\]). As against this, it is “the exception rather than the norm for adult offenders to be sentenced to probation” ( Jordan Lim at \[34\]). _

25     In this current case, it was clear that because of the age of the Accused, there was no presumption in favour of the Accused that rehabilitation was the dominant sentencing principle which warranted the grant of probation.

## _Whether the Accused demonstrated an_ **_extremely strong propensity for reform _**_and/or there were_ **_exceptional circumstances warranting the grant of probation_**

26     That said, rehabilitation may become an operative consideration if certain “_offender-specific traits_”[^3] were present i.e. if the Accused demonstrated an extremely strong propensity for reform and/or exceptional circumstances existed. I thus turned to consider whether these factors were present which may cause rehabilitation to be brought to the forefront as a dominant sentencing consideration. At the same time I was mindful that even if rehabilitation was found to apply, it could be displaced by the need for deterrence, as was held by the court in _GCO v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 1402</span>. Deterrence would become relatively more prominent, and rehabilitation correspondingly less so, if the offence is serious or the harm caused is severe, amongst other considerations[^4]. 

27     In his mitigation, Counsel explained that a motorcycle accident in May 2018 had left the Accused feeling a deep sense of hopelessness about life. He began binge drinking to help himself cope. At the time of the commission of his offences, the Accused was completely consumed by his grief and was living life recklessly and aimlessly[^5]. Counsel highlighted that the offences were out of character and was committed at a time when the Accused’s life was spiralling out of control as he was unable to cope with the stresses of life[^6]. It was after the incident at the bus interchange that the Accused decided to turn his life around. Accused was genuinely remorseful, took active steps to leave his errant ways behind and had not re-offended since the last incident on 22 November 2019[^7]. In addition, the Accused is assured of strong familial support, an external support system in the form of his fiancé and continues to be meaningfully engaged in both school and employment.

28     I had no doubt that the Accused was genuinely remorseful for his offences. He had pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity and was untraced, prior to the offences. However, whilst I could appreciate the unfortunate circumstances which led to the Accused’s offending and found that the conduct of the Accused after the last of the offences in November 2019 did manifest a potential for reform on his part, I was of the view that the nature and the gravity of the offences in this case continued to place deterrence as the dominant sentencing consideration in this case.

### Nature and gravity of the offences

29     In the context of cases involving offences against police officers, I found that deterrence is the operative sentencing consideration. Two of the five proceeded charges which the Accused pleaded guilty to involved threats and the use of abusive language towards police officers.

30     The public interest to protect police officers on duty was affirmed by the High Court in _PP v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 306</span> (“_Jeffrey Yeo_”). At \[50\], the court stated that police officers had to be assured of “_adequate protection and vindication by the law against behaviour that might compromise the effective discharge of their duties_”. As drawn out in the case of _Public Prosecutor v Ng Eong Chien_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 16</span>, even though _Jeffrey Yeo_ was a case involving a section 332 Penal Code offence of causing hurt to a public servant who is performing his public duties, in _PP v Stephen Albert_ (MA 9254/2017) (“_Stephen Albert_”) which was heard after _Jeffrey Yeo_, Justice of Appeal Tay Yong Kwang held that “\[t\]_he reasons justifying deterrent sentences for s 332 Penal Code offences against police officers apply equally to s353 Penal Code offences involving police officers.”_

31     In _Stephen Albert_, the offender was only 19 years old but in light of the public interest for a deterrent sentence and the facts of that case, Tay JA rejected the offender’s plea for probation but instead, increased his jail sentence for a section 353 Penal Code offence (for spitting at a police officer) from two weeks to four weeks’ imprisonment. Tay JA also did not consider the offender’s state of intoxication as a mitigating factor and said that it was an aggravating factor[^8].

32     In another case of _Ho Mei Xia v Public Prosecutor and another_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 978</span>, the offender was 20 years old when she pleaded guilty to three charges, namely for disorderly behaviour under section 20 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act, causing hurt to a police officer under section 332 of the Penal Code and for using abusive words towards a public servant under section 6(3) POHA. Despite her age which suggested that rehabilitation was the primary sentencing consideration, the appellate court was of the view that that had been displaced by the need for deterrence. The appellate court declined to call for a pre-sentence suitability report, being satisfied that probation was not a realistic option and agreed with the District Judge that specific and general deterrence were the dominant sentencing considerations in this case[^9].

33     Each case must ultimately be decided on its own facts but the clear and strong message from these precedents is that offences against police officers must be met with robust and sufficiently deterrent sentences. As further noted by the court in _Ng Eong Chien_ at \[21\], whose observations I fully agree with:

> _“… there ought to be a very strong public interest to protect public servants from abuse by the very members of the public whom the officers selflessly serve and protect when discharging their public duties. In particular, police officers fall into a category of public servants who are especially vulnerable and exposed to unreasonable, unruly and even violent members of the public. When police officers go about their policing duties, they must be able to discharge their duties without fear or favour. Therefore, it is imperative for the courts to do our part to protect our police officers by adequately punishing offenders and effectively deter would-be offenders who assault and abuse police officers when they execute their public duties. A weak and insufficient sentence would not only fail to send a clear deterrent signal to would-be offenders but would lessen the moral and legal authority that police officers must be empowered in order to effectively perform their functions._

34     In the present case, whilst there was no criminal force used on or hurt caused to a police officer, the fact that the object of Accused’s death threat was a police officer in the course of his discharge of his public duty made the offence particularly aggravating. At the material time, police officers were effecting arrest on another male subject when the Accused approached them aggressively. The officers managed to move the Accused away from the other male subject and it was in that context that the Accused remained uncooperative, behaved aggressively when he pointed his finger at Sgt Lock as he uttered those words “Sir, I make sure I murder you”.

35     In a separate incident which took place only three days later, the Accused again refused to cooperate with police officers who had been called to the scene. After being arrested, the Accused began using vulgarities on Sgt Ken. Despite being warned repeatedly not to do so, the Accused continue to release a torrent of extremely abusive words towards Sgt Ken during the journey in the police car from Kramat Road to Tanglin Police Divisional Headquarters.

36     The belligerent behaviour exhibited by the Accused on both these occasions against police officers could not be condoned. The fact of his intoxication was an aggravating factor which added to the gravity of the offences. I was of the view that general and specific deterrence continued to be the dominant sentencing principles where these offences were concerned. I was satisfied that probation would not be an appropriate sentence, given the totality of facts in the case.

## The Appropriate Sentence

### Offence of criminal intimidation Section 506 Penal Code

37     Leaving aside the fact that the target of the threat and abuse was a police officer in the execution of his public duty, the offence of criminal intimidation under section 506 of the Penal Code (second limb), is in itself a serious offence. The offence which involved a death threat was punishable with an imprisonment term which may extend to 10 years, or with fine, or with both. In the case of _Woon Salvacion Dalayon v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 1 SLR(R) 129</span>, Chief Justice Yong Pung How as he then was, stated that:

> _“Threats to cause death, no matter how casually said, are a serious matter and are so regarded by the court. Offences under the second limb of s 506 are invariably punished with custodial sentences because of the seriousness of these offences”._

38     Prosecution submitted that from the precedents, the starting point for cases under the second limb of section 506 where a threat of death was uttered was six months imprisonment[^10]. Defence on the other hand, tendered precedents which revealed a sentence of three months’ imprisonment[^11], notably, against persons who were not police officers. Taking into account that the threat consisted only words with no weapon used; uttered only once, but against a police officer, I was of the view that an imprisonment term of four months would be appropriate for the Accused.

### Offence of using abusive words towards a public servant under section 6(1)(a) POHA

39     A general survey of such offences committed against police officers reveal a range of sentences from fines to generally short terms of imprisonment. In this case, both the Prosecution and the Defence were in agreement that a custodial sentence was appropriate, save they differed in the length of imprisonment to be imposed. Counsel urged the Court to impose a sentence of one week’s imprisonment based on the precedents, namely _Ng Eong Chien_ and _Public Prosecutor v Chou You Jin_ (DAC 909955/2017, unreported)[^12]. Prosecution submitted for a term of three weeks’ imprisonment, taking guidance from the case of _Public Prosecutor v Mujubur Rahman Bin Syed Mohamed Hussain_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 7</span>. In that case, the court imposed a sentence of one month’s imprisonment. The court took into account the fact the offender had 2 other similar counts under the same section taken into consideration; clearly the verbal abuse against public servants by the offender was not a one-off incident[^13].

40     In this present case, as mentioned, the Accused hurled a string of abusive words, with expletives towards Sgt Ken relentlessly throughout the journey to the police station whilst in the police car. In addition, the Accused had another charge under section 6(1)(a) POHA taken into consideration for purposes of sentencing, where he admitted to using abusive words against a female police officer in a public place on a separate occasion. This was conduct deserving of a more severe sentence than one week’s imprisonment. I decided that two weeks’ imprisonment would be an appropriate sentence.

### Offences of causing hurt under section 323 of the Penal Code and disorderly behaviour under section 20 MOA

41     Both the Prosecution and the Defence were of the view that fines were the appropriate sentence. I was of the same mind, noting the low level of harm caused and the circumstances surrounding the offences.

42     In this regard, Counsel added that his client would not be able to afford the payment of any fines and implored the court to impose short custodial terms in the range of three to five days imprisonment on the charges[^14]. I was reluctant to do so. In my mind, fines were the appropriate sentence which would accurately reflect the nature and the gravity of the offences, not custodial terms, no matter how short they may be. Being mindful of the limited financial means of the Accused, I thus imposed fines on the remaining three charges but heavily calibrated the default sentences downwards.

43     In summary, the sentences imposed were:

44     I ordered both the imprisonment terms to run consecutively as they concerned distinct offences which occurred on separate occasions. The total sentence was: 4 months’ and 2 weeks’ imprisonment and fine of $2000, in default 4 days’ imprisonment.

45     Taking a last look at the sentence, I was satisfied that the global sentence imposed was fair and proportionate. It did not have the effect of imposing on the Accused “_a crushing sentence not in keeping with his record and prospects_”[^15]. The Accused will have to bear the consequences of his actions in this episode of his life through an imprisonment term. However, being the determined young adult he is, he can certainly close this chapter and put it behind him once the custodial term is served and still forge ahead to be a contributing member of society.
