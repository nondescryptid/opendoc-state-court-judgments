\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9156/2019/01-02\]

7 August 2019

### District Judge Hamidah Bte Ibrahim:

The accused, a 61-year-old male Singaporean, faces 2 charges under the Building Control Act (BCA), Chapter 29. He pleaded guilty to the first charge which is under section 18(1) punishable under Section 18(3). This charge (MSC-901045-2018) contain the following details:

> In Singapore, being an accredited checker appointed under section 8 of the BCA for the building works related to the construction and completion of the new westbound viaduct from Tampines Expressway (TPE) to Pan-Island Expressway (PIE) and Upper Changi Road East, the accused did between 18 November 2016 and 13 June 2017, fail to check the detailed structural plans and design calculations of the building works in accordance with the building regulations by failing to evaluate, analyse and review the structural design in the plans in respect of and perform original calculations for all the permanent corbels, which are key structural elements of the building, which is the viaduct of the above-mentioned building works.

2       Upon his conviction, the accused person admitted to the remaining charge under section 43A(a) and punishable under section 43A of having made false certificates and consented for it to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The accused was sentenced to serve 6 months’ imprisonment.

3       Both the prosecution and the accused are now appealing against the sentence.

## Statement of Facts (SOF)

4       The SOF which the accused admitted without any qualification disclosed the following material facts:

> 1.    The Accused is the Managing Director of Calibre Consulting (Singapore) Pte Ltd and an engineer.

> THE FACTS PERTAINING TO THE CHARGE

> 2.    In June 2016, pursuant to section 8 of the Building Control Act (Cap 29, 1999 Rev Ed) (the “Act”), the Accused was appointed as an accredited checker by the Land Transport Authority (the “Developer”) for the building works related to the construction and completion of the new viaduct (the “Viaduct”) from TPE to PIE (Westbound) and Upper Changi Road East (the “Site”).

> 3.    At the material time, the other parties involved in the construction of the Viaduct were:

>> a.    Robert Arianto Tjandra – the Qualified Person appointed under section 11 of the Act to design the building works of the Viaduct and the Qualified Person appointed under section 8 of the Act to supervise the building works of the Viaduct; and

>> b.    Or Kim Peow Contractors (Private) Limited – the Builder of the Viaduct.

> 4.    Pursuant to section 18(1) of the Act read with paragraph 7(1) of the Building Control (Accredited Checkers and Accredited Checking Organisations) Regulations (the “Regulations”) the Accused was under a duty as the accredited checker to evaluate, analyse and review the structural design in the plans of any building works and perform such original calculations with a view to determining the adequacy of the key structural elements of the building, being the Viaduct, to be erected or affected by the building works carried out in accordance with those plans. Section 2(1) of the Act defines “key structural elements” to mean the foundations, columns, beams, shear cores, structural walls, struts, ground anchors and such other parts of a building which are essential for its support and overall structural stability.

> 5.    The Viaduct was approximately 1.8 kilometres long and is a structure which consists of eight Flyovers as shown in Annex A. Each Flyover is a monolithic structure supported by 5 to 9 columns (depending on the length of the Flyover) which are integrated with the flyover structure and with expansion joints at each end of the Flyover. The permanent corbels of the Viaduct were located at the Expansion Joints indicated in Annex A. A permanent corbel is a short reinforced concrete projection from the crosshead at an Expansion Joint to support one end of a Flyover, and part of the vehicular loads on a Flyover would have been transferred to the independent column through the permanent corbel as shown in Annex B. As such, the permanent corbels were key structural elements of the Viaduct as they were essential for the support and overall structural stability of the Viaduct.

> 6.    Between 18 November 2016 and 13 June 2017 (“the submissions stage”), the Building Engineering Group of the BCA received the following applications by the qualified person, Robert Arianto Tjandra, for the approval of plans of the building works by the Commissioner of Building Control pursuant to section 5 of the Act (the “relevant plans”):

>> a.    18 November 2016 – Application for Approval of Structural Plan 13 relating to Piers 7 to 20 of the Viaduct;

>> b.    9 February 2017 – Application for Approval of Structural Plan 14 relating to Pier 36 to Abutment 3;

>> c.    15 May 2017 – Application for Approval of Structural Plan 17 relating to Pier 20 to Abutment 2 of the Viaduct; and

>> d.    13 June 2017 – Application for Approval of Structural Plan 18 relating to Abutment 1 to Pier 7.

> 7.    On 14 July 2017 at around 3.30am, the crossheads at Pier 40 and Pier 41 of the Viaduct, which were temporary structures, gave way. As a result, the precast girders and formwork supporting the casting of the concrete deck slab of the Viaduct collapsed (the “incident”), causing the death of one worker involved in the building works at the material time, and injuring ten others with varying degrees of hurt and grievous hurt.

> 8.    Arising from the incident, the Building and Construction Authority (the “BCA”) investigated for any possible contraventions under the Act. Investigations revealed that:

>> a.    in the design calculations submitted to the BCA for the relevant plans, there were no independent calculations for the permanent corbels of the Viaduct prepared or submitted by the Accused, which were key structural elements of the Viaduct, and

>> b.    the Accused as the accredited checker, had failed to evaluate, analyze and review the structural design in the relevant plans and perform original calculations for all the permanent corbels of the Viaduct as was his statutory duty under section 18(1) of the Act.

> 9.    During BCA’s investigations, the Accused initially claimed on 26 July 2017 that at the submissions stage, he had performed original calculations, checked the adequacy of the permanent corbels and found them to be adequate. The Accused was asked to provide evidence of such original calculations but was unable to do so. He admitted on 21 September 2017 that no calculations were done at all after his engineer Shivananni Yalagunda Siddalingaiah (“Shivananni”) had verified from the records and documentations that these calculations were not present. Shivananni had initially claimed on 7 August 2017 that calculations were performed to check the adequacy of the permanent corbels. Subsequently, on 15 September 2017, Shivananni admitted that no calculations were performed for all the corbels (permanent and temporary) during the submissions stage. After the incident, the Accused had, through his engineers, performed calculations to check the adequacy of the permanent corbels and found them to be inadequate.

> 10.    Specifically, investigations revealed that corbels at eight out of the 10 piers with permanent corbels were inadequately designed, with five piers (_viz_. P7, P14, P20, P26 and P35) being unable to support its intended weight during the construction stage. Therefore, the five permanent corbels would have collapsed during the casting of the slab at the construction stage. As for the remaining three piers (P1, P31 and P36), while they may support the weight during the construction stage, when the span is opened to full traffic load the corbels would show significant structural cracks that would lead to sudden brittle failure leading to collapse.

> 11.    The table below sets out the Capacity Demand Ratio (“CDR”) of the 10 piers permanent corbels.[^1]

## The Sentence

5       The prescribed penalty for the offence which the accused has been convicted of under section 18(1) of the BCA is a fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment not exceeding 2 years or to both[^4].

6       In their written address on sentence the prosecution, stressing that general deterrence is the dominant sentencing principle for offences under section 18(3) of the BCA as the offence in question affects public safety, and that the custodial threshold has been crossed, submitted for a sentence of at least 9 months imprisonment, given the degree of the culpability of the accused. They proposed that a new sentencing framework should be imposed for such offences. Relying on their proposed sentencing framework, and adopting a 2 stage approach, which involved firstly determining the starting point for sentencing based on an accused person’s culpability and potential harm and adjusting the starting point with the relevant aggravating/mitigating factors, they submitted that custodial sentences within the framework once ‘medium potential harm’ is established should be deployed. They added that custodial sentences under section 18(3) of the BCA would align it with offences under section 15(3)(A) of the Workplace Safety and Health Act (WSHA) which similarly deals with endangerment to society. In this case, they pegged the accused’s case within the “high potential harm/medium culpability” band of their framework which would call for a sentence in the region of 10-15 months imprisonment. Taking into account the mitigating factors, the sentence should be reduced accordingly to 9 month’s imprisonment.

7       Counsel for the accused, who is a qualified civil engineer and a first offender, in his written plea in mitigation, submitted that a custodial sentence would be draconian and that a fine of $25,000 would be appropriate. They stressed the fact that the inadvertent oversight on the accused’s part in failing to check the design flaws of the permanent corbels were discovered before any actual harm was caused and hence would not result in any potential harm. There was no wilful default on his part. They argued that the accused’s duty to check is secondary to that of the qualified person. Further, the accused cannot be linked to the viaduct incident of 14 July 2017 as the defective temporary corbels which caused the said incident was not part of his work scope. Notwithstanding his poor health, counsel said that the accused was co-operative during investigation, was extremely remorseful, had put into place an improved job workflow to prevent a recurrence of the oversight and had pleaded guilty promptly.

8       At the outset, it was common ground between the prosecution and the defence that the collapse of the viaduct on 14 July 2017 was not caused by any of the permanent corbels which is the subject matter of the current charge against the accused. In considering what would be the appropriate sentence for this accused’s transgression of the law, I was minded to agree with the prosecution that the accused’s culpability here and the potential harm which could have resulted from his breach clearly calls for a custodial sentence. In the first place, as the accredited checker appointed by the developer of the project, namely LTA, it was his statutory duty under the BCA to check the detailed structural plans and design calculations of the building works prepared by the qualified person (QP) for the building works.

9       The accused’s role is critical as the Commissioner of Building may approve the plans upon his certification that he had checked the plans and that they do not show any inadequacy in the key structural elements of the building. Since an accredited checker like the accused must be from a different firm from the QP, he was expected to submit an independent set of calculations and analysis to ensure that the design was sound and sufficiently robust. The duty falls squarely on the accused to carry out a thorough check on the designs and to perform original calculations to determine the adequacy of the key structural elements.

10     The accused here has admitted that he did not conduct any independent calculation of the permanent corbels which are the key structural elements of the viaduct and he failed to review the structural design for these corbels. He has admitted that 8 out of the 10 piers with permanent corbels were inadequately designed such that it would not have been able to support its intended weight during the construction stage which therefore meant that it would have collapsed during the casting of the slab. For the rest, while they may remain intact during the construction stage, once the viaduct is completed and subject to the full traffic load, there would be significant structural cracks which likewise would lead to a collapse. This is based on the table[^5] where it showed that 8 of the 10 permanent corbels had a capacity demand ratio of less than 1 which meant they were inadequately designed for the total load including vehicular traffic upon completion of the viaduct. While it is indeed fortuitous that this did not happen, and the accused’s breach was discovered in the course of the investigation of the incident of 14 July 2017, it cannot be seriously disputed that the potential for harm is very high.

11     If a collapse were to occur during the construction stage, the possibility of workers at the scene being killed or injured seriously is real and cannot be trivialised. And, if it collapsed after construction and opened to vehicular traffic, I agree with the prosecution that the casualties that would have been caused is unimaginable. The important role therefore played by the accused as an accredited checker in ensuring that catastrophic accidents do not occur as a result of inadequacies in the design cannot be understated. While the accused has conceded that the 10 corbels were undoubtedly key structural elements out of the 284 key structural elements for the viaduct as they were essential for the support and overall structural stability of the viaduct, as provided under section 2(1) of the BCA, he appeared to be downplaying the potential seriousness of his breach by emphasising the fact that no actual harm resulted. This cannot by any stretch of the imagination be considered as mitigating and at best, its neutral. In fact, if there was actual harm it would have been an aggravating factor and he certainly cannot claim any credit for the fact that the inadequacies were discovered because of the incident of the 14 July 2017.

12     Offences under section 18(3) of the BCA therefore involved the issue of public safety and it is accepted that general deterrence must be the primary sentencing consideration for such offences. In this regard, I was persuaded by the prosecution that incorporating custodial sentences within the sentencing framework for these offences would align it with the Workplace Safety and Health Act (WSHA). My attention was brought to the fact, that firstly, when the penalties for the offences under section 18 (3) of the BCA were increased in 2008, it was said in Parliament by the then Minister in charge of State for National Development, Ms Grace Fu, in responding to a question as to whether there was a need to increase the penalties or even have custodial sentences for offences under the BCA:

> “_I think the purpose of revising the penalties here is just to ensure that the severity and the offences commensurate with one another, and that the penalties serve as an effective deterrence._ **_Custodial sentence is common for serious offences that could cause death or injury_**_……. Are higher penalties and custodial provisions effective deterrence? We believe so….. It just serves as deterrence_**_….._**_”[^6]_ (emphasis added).

13     Without a doubt, the intention by Parliament was unequivocally clear that deterrence was to be increased not only through financial penalties but through custodial sentences as well and aligning the punishment regime with WSHA. The maximum sentence as stipulated for such offences signals the gravity with which Parliament views any individual offence and it ought to be taken into account when calibrating the appropriate sentence. On this issue, I was guided by the pronouncements of the Honourable Chao Hick Tin JA in _Ong Chee Eng v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 776</span> at \[24\] where he said:

> “_The court must resist an unhesitating application of benchmark sentences without first thoroughly considering if the particular factual circumstances of a case fall within the reasonable parameters of the benchmark case._ **_Ultimately, where Parliament has enacted a range of possible sentences, it is the duty of the court to ensure that the full spectrum is carefully explored in determining the appropriate sentence._** _Where benchmarks harden into rigid formulae which suggest that only a segment of the possible sentencing range should be applied by the court, there is a risk that the court might inadvertently usurp the legislative function.” (emphasis added)_

14     Subsequently, in _PP v Hue An Li_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 661</span>, a 3 judge panel of the High Court affirmed the principle that it was incumbent on the sentencing court to take note of the statutory maximum sentence and determine precisely where the offender’s conduct falls within the spectrum of punishment as stipulated under the relevant Act. As rightly pointed out by the prosecution, however, it would appear that the full spectrum of the sentencing options have not been engaged by the courts. To date, no custodial sentences have been imposed for offences under section 18(3) of the BCA. On record, in the case of an accredited checker in _Public Prosecutor v Bill Hong Keng Chee and 2 ors_ (BCA 43-44/99 and BCA 46-48/99)[^7] the sentence that was imposed was the then maximum fine of $50,000. This case was decided before the sentence for an offence under s 18(3) of the Act was increased in 2008. Apart from the _Bill Hong_ case, the precedents indicate that the usual sentences for such offences have been fines in the region of $4,000 to $6,000. The sentences imposed therefore is less than 10% of the current maximum fine of $100,000 and they sit definitely in the lowest levels of the sentencing spectrum.

15     In accepting the prosecution’s submission that incorporating custodial sentences within the sentencing framework for offences under 18(3) of the Act would align it with the WSHA, I agree that the offences under section 18(3) of the BCA and section 15(3A) of the WSHA seek to deter similar types of actions, namely non-compliance with statutory duties under the respective Acts. The objectives of both Acts is to protect public safety and prevent accidents due to non-compliance. It was also Parliament’s intention for the sentencing regimes under the WSHA and the BCA to be aligned with each other as the same minister, during the second reading of the BC (Amendment) Bill in 2007 had also said:

> “_In moving the Workplace Safety and Health Bill last year, the Minister for Manpower has asserted the need to ensure that penalties for non-compliance are set at a high enough level to reflect the true cost of poor safety management. This Bill will_ **_align the penalties for offences under the Building Control Act with those for offences of similar severity under the Workplace Safety and Health Act (WSHA)_**

> _\[…\]_

> _As a respectable profession, we do not think that professional engineers will ask themselves to be treated differently from a manager at the worksite._ **_By putting the sentence or the punishment at the same level as the Workplace Safety and Health Act, we think that it is a very fair and equitable treatment”.[^8]_**

16     Turning back to the facts of this case, giving greater weight to the potential for harm in comparison to the offender’s culpability, it bears emphasis to state that the accused’s breach of his duties were serious as the permanent corbels were the key structural elements of the viaduct. He failed to perform any independent calculations for the permanent corbels and checked its adequacy. This would include failing to ascertain the structural design concept used, failing to determine the stability and robustness of the structural system and failing to analyse the plans for the permanent corbels. By relying on his subordinates, namely his engineers to identify the key structural elements the accused has been tardy in discharging his duty under the Act. By failing to adequately check on their work, and taking the risk that they had performed their duties in strict compliance with the provisions of section 18(3), the accused cannot be said to have committed a mere oversight as their non-compliance may result in serious consequences and I am inclined to find that he was being rash in so doing.

17     Applying the non-exhaustive list of factor to be considered in assessing the level of potential harm as set out in the case of _Nurun Novy Saydur Rahman v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 413</span> at \[86\] which included the seriousness of the harm risked, the likelihood of that harm arising and the number of people likely to be exposed to the risk of the harm, I find that potential harm caused by the accused’s failure to comply with his statutory duty is high. 8 of the 10 permanent corbels were inadequately designed for the total load, including traffic upon completion of the viaduct and even at the construction stage. The collapse of the viaduct, if these transgressions by the accused had not been detected, would have been inevitable.

18     In their mitigation plea, I note that counsel for the accused, in highlighting previous cases where fines had been imposed argued that there was no prevalence of such offences, that there was no increase in the breaches of section 18(3) of the BCA and there were only a handful of cases where accredited checkers have been prosecuted. This is unlike the construction site and industrial accidents which they said is on the upsurge. To wait for catastrophes to happen and even more serious breaches to occur before a custodial sentence is considered, in my view, might be too late and would not be the right course of action as it would be more effective to nip such transgressions in the first place (where the potential for harm is high) to send a clear message that the Law intend to treat such cases seriously by passing a custodial sentence. This of course certainly does not mean that every such breach by an accredited checker of section 18(3) of the BCA deserves a custodial sentence. It is trite law that it would depend on the specific facts and circumstances of each case and I would reckon that all can agree that a key structural element of a smaller structure would have a lower potential for harm, if it were to collapse in comparison to a major viaduct involving 2 major highways.

19     I shall address the point made by counsel that there were close to 300 structural elements in the project and since the accused failed to check only 10 permanent corbels, his non-compliance cannot be perceived as that serious. I disagree. This seems to ignore the fact that every permanent corbel is important as it serves to provide stability to the structure and if even 1 corbel turned out to be inadequate there is the potential for harm, let alone 10 corbels. Here, the defence is not disputing the assertion of the prosecution that the rest of the stretches of the viaduct at the 8 piers would have collapsed during the construction stage or when finally open to vehicular traffic and hence the potential for harm is very high.

20     While I had no issues with the prosecution submission that the appropriate starting point for this accused would be 12.5 months imprisonment as it represents the midpoint in the medium culpability/high potential harm category in the proposed sentencing framework, I was not persuaded that taking into account the offender specific factors, a sentence of 9 months imprisonment would be appropriate. This would be crushing considering that the accused is also a first offender under the Act. I find that such a sentence did not give sufficient weight to the mitigating factors, namely the fact that the accused had pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity, was co-operative during investigation, was extremely remorseful and had put into place an improved job workflow[^9] to prevent a recurrence of what was described as an oversight. These factors were not seriously challenged by the prosecution. Although the prosecution had argued that the accused only pleaded guilty to the offence because the evidence against him is overwhelming, some credit must still go to him as by so doing he has spared witnesses from coming to court and saved precious judicial resources.

21     On the other hand, I agree with the prosecution that the fact the QP had prepared an inadequate design has no significant impact on the accused’s culpability and is not a mitigating factor. It was precisely his duty to check and ensure that the flaws and inadequacies in the design do not go undetected. The role of an accredited checker is statutory and was created by Parliament to serve as an additional layer on the plans prepared by the QP to ensure that there is no inadequacy in the key structural elements of the building and that the safe design and structural integrity of building structures is not compromised. When he failed to perform his duty under the Act, in this case, I agree with the prosecution that the accused had seriously risked the lives of workers involved in building the viaduct as well as the lives of future users of the viaduct. Considering the fact that the potential for harm is on the high side, a sentence of 6 months imprisonment would be appropriate.

## Conclusion

22     All considered, I sentenced the accused to serve 6 months’ imprisonment. He is currently on bail pending the hearing of his appeal.
