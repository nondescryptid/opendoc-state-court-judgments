Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Criminal Breach of Trust as a Servant

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9230/2021/01.\]

25 November 2021

### District Judge Christopher Goh Eng Chiang:

## Introduction

1       The accused faced a total of 19 charges. 18 charges were for abetting, by engaging in a conspiracy with other co-conspirators, to commit criminal breach of trust as a servant (“CBT charges”), an offence under s 408 read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”). There was one other charged of converting the monies he had benefitted from the CBT offences into two cars, an offence under s 47(1)(b) and punishable under s 47(6)(a) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 65A, 2000 Rev Ed) (“CDSA”). This is an amalgamated charge under s 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”).

2       A brief chronology of the events is as follows:

> (a)     On 6 January 2021, the accused pleaded guilty to nine CBT charges and one CDSA charge. Nine similar CBT charges were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing (“TIC”);

> (b)     On 5 July 2021, I sentenced the accused to 114 months’ imprisonment. At the same hearing, a co-conspirator was sentenced to 80 months’ imprisonment for similar charges;

> (c)     The co-conspirator filed an appeal against his sentence and on 17 July 2021. My Grounds of Decision can be found at _PP v Sadagopan Premnath_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 186</span> (“_Sadagopan_”);

> (d)     The accused subsequently filed Criminal Motion (“CM”) 79 of 2021 for an extension of time to file a Notice of Appeal. This was granted by the High Court on 14 October 2021, and the accused duly filed the Notice of Appeal against sentence on 18 October 2021.

## The Charges

3       The accused is a 39-year-old Singapore Citizen. Between August 2014 and March 2015 and between November 2015 and February 2016, the accused abetted, by engaging in a conspiracy with other co-conspirators, including Muzaffar Ali Khan bin Muhammad Akram (“Muzaffar”), Juandi Bin Pungot (“Juandi”), Tiah Kok Hwee (“Tiah”), Cai Zhi Zhong (“Cai”), Koh Choon Wei (“Koh”)[^1] and Muhamad Farhan bin Mohamad Rashid (“Farhan”) to commit CBT as servants.

4       The accused and the co-conspirators were all employees of Shell Eastern Petroleum Pte Ltd (“the Company” or “Shell”) at the time of the offences. They conspired to dishonestly misappropriate gasoil that was entrusted to them by transferring the gasoil out of the Company’s Pulau Bukom manufacturing site (“Shell PB”). The particulars of the nine CBT charges are as follows:

## The Statement of Facts

7       The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification. The following is a summary of the facts.

### Introduction: The CBT charges

8       After Shell had suffered unidentified loss of fuel amounting to SGD2.98 million in April 2017, a Shell representative made a police report on 1 August 2017. Thereafter, the Police commenced investigations into the suspected theft of gasoil from the Shell PB.

### The Conspiracy

9       The accused was one of the co-conspirators involved in a long-term and large-scale conspiracy to misappropriate gasoil from the Shell PB. The accused had been a part of Team D at Shell PB, together with Muzaffar, Juandi, Koh, Tiah, Cai and Farhan.

10     The dishonest misappropriation or “illegal loading” of gasoil had commenced as far back as 2007. Juandi and one Abdul Latif bin Ibrahim (“Latif”) started the conspiracy to misappropriate gasoil from Shell. Muzaffar, a key mastermind, joined the conspiracy a short while later. The accused himself was recruited no later than 2010. Tiah joined the syndicate in 2011.

11     In 2013, Latif, a key member, left Team D and the illegal loadings stopped for a period of time. In mid-2014, Juandi, Muzaffar and the accused continued their criminal activities without Latif, with Juandi and Muzaffar now being the key leaders of the syndicate. Koh subsequently joined the team as a key leader. Together, these three key conspirators directed, planned and initiated illegal loadings. Farhan and Cai subsequently joined the syndicate.

12     Juandi and Muzaffar would approach Captains of vessels to determine if they were interested in performing illegal loadings and would proceed if an agreement could be reached. Juandi also met with surveyors, who offered to source for foreign vessels who would be interested in purchasing the misappropriated gasoil. One such person was “Colin”, an ex-surveyor who suggested that they work together to perform illegal loadings for vessels belonging to Prime Shipping Corporation (“Prime”).

13     Juandi discussed this with Muzaffar, Cai, Tiah and the accused and they all agreed to this scheme. Accordingly, “Colin” would be provided with the Team D roster so that he could arrange with Prime for their vessels to berth at Shell PB when Team D was on duty. From 2016, the Team D syndicate supplied multiple Prime vessels with misappropriated gasoil on numerous occasions. They also sold misappropriated gasoil to both bunker vessels and oil tankers from other local corporate buyers.

14     The accused left the syndicate sometime in 2016 as he decided not to be involved further. He requested a transfer to a different team.

### Roles of the co-conspirators

15     The following were the roles of the conspirators:

> (a)     Juandi, Muzaffar and Koh. They were the key members of the syndicate. They directed and led the illegal loadings. Their roles included interacting directly with ship Captains, planning, linking with third-party middlemen and surveyors, recruitment and training of co-conspirators, negotiating the price and deciding on profit distribution;

> (b)     Cai and Tiah. While they were not the leaders of the syndicate, they were just as crucial. Their roles involved setting up WhatsApp groups for communications relating to the illegal loading, assisting in the training of co-conspirators, possessed the requisite technical knowledge to manipulate gasoil movements. Tiah also had direct interaction with the ship Captains and liaised with the bunker clerks;

> (c)     Farhan and the accused. They took directions from the other co-conspirators. They were the black oil panel men. They ensured that the misappropriated gasoil could be received by the waiting vessels without being detected. They were knowledgeable and experienced in their operation of the valves, and the Panel in the Movement Control Room (“MCR”).

16     The accused’s primary role during the incidents of misappropriation was to open and close the bypass valve to facilitate the transfer of misappropriated gasoil, by permitting the gasoil to bypass the custody transfer meters which would otherwise capture the movement of oil. The accused was aware of this. He also assisted within the MCR by operating the oil panel within. He took directions from Juandi and Muzaffar as to when to open and close the bypass valve and when to start the pump manually from the MCR. As a member of the syndicate, the accused profited from the incidents of misappropriation even if he was not physically present.

17     Pursuant to the conspiracy, the accused therefore abetted the commission of the nine proceeded CBT charges of gasoil as a servant. The vessels involved in the proceeded CBT charges are set out at \[37\] of the SOF.

18     In total, the accused abetted the commission of criminal breach of trust of misappropriated gasoil between 2014 and 2016 valued at about USD24,856,271, or approximately SGD33,561,383.89. He has made no restitution to the Company for his offences.

### The CDSA charge

19     Between 18 November 2015 and 17 August 2017, the accused converted a sum of SGD191,703.16, which in whole represented the benefits from criminal conduct, namely the CBT offences, by using the amount to purchase a Volvo V40 motorcar bearing registration plate SKW6646X.

20     The amount of SGD191,703.16 comprised of the following:

> (a)     SGD110,000, being the trade-in value of a BMW Z4 motorcar which the accused had purchased entirely with criminal proceeds; and

> (b)     SGD91,703, being the subsequent instalments that the accused paid for the Volvo V40, which was from monies obtained from his criminal conduct.

### Consequences for Shell

21     By the end of 2020, the estimated cost _directly_ incurred by Shell to manage the consequences of the long-term misappropriation of gasoil was approximately SGD6 million.

## Antecedents

22     The accused is a first offender.

## Prosecution’s submission on sentence

23     There were separate submissions for the CBT charges and the CDSA charge. The Prosecution’s sentencing submission for the CBT charges was comprehensive. As there was no sentencing framework for offences under s 408 of the PC, the Prosecution proceeded to submit one for the Court to consider and adopt.

### A sentencing framework for the CBT charges[^2]

24     The sentencing framework proposed by the Prosecution comprised of five steps, as per the sentencing frameworks adopted in _Logachev Valdislav v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 609</span> (“_Logachev_”) and _Huang Ying-Chun v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 606</span> (“_Huang Ying-Chun”_), and is intended to be of general application to offences under section 408 of the PC. The five steps are as follows:

#### Step 1: Assessing the offence-specific factors

25     The first step was to consider the offence-specific factors and identify the level of harm caused and the offender’s culpability. This is summarised in the following table:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="49.68%"> <col width="50.32%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="b" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Offence-specific factors</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Factors going towards harm</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Factors going towards culpability</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1) The amount involved</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2) Involvement of a syndicate</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3) Involvement of a transnational element</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4) Effect on the victim</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5) Harm done to confidence in public administration</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1) Degree of planning and premeditation</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2) Level of sophistication</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3) Duration of the offending</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4) Offender’s role</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5) Abuse of position and breach of trust</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

#### Step 2: Identify the applicable indicative starting range

26     This step involves identifying the indicative sentencing range in the sentencing matrix for each individual charge against the offender. The following sentencing matrix was proposed which utilised the entire sentencing range.[^3]

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="20.8358328334333%"> <col width="25.8348330333933%"> <col width="25.8348330333933%"> <col width="27.49450109978%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Culpability</b></p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Harm</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Low Culpability</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Medium Culpability</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>High Culpability</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Slight Harm</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Up to 15 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">15 to 45 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">45 to 90 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Moderate Harm</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">15 to 45 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">45 to 90 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">90 to 135 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Severe Harm</b></p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">45 to 90 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">90 to 135 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">135 to 180 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

#### Step 3: Identifying the indicative starting point within the indicative starting range

27     The offence-specific factors are then examined to identify the appropriate starting point. The Prosecution highlighted that this issue did not arise in the application of the proposed framework to the present case in particular as the appropriate starting point may well fall beyond the higher end of a given range, in a case involving an exceptionally large amount of money. It was submitted that this would be in line with the proposition that the seriousness of a CBT offence generally increases with the value of property dishonestly misappropriated.

#### Step 4: Make adjustments to the starting point for the offender-specific factors

28     The fourth step is to make further adjustments to account for offender aggravating and mitigating factors. This included the following:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="49.68%"> <col width="50.32%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="b" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Offender-specific factors</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Aggravating factors</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Mitigating factors</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1) TIC offences</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2) Relevant antecedents</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3) Evident lack of remorse</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1) A guilty plea</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2) Voluntary restitution</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3) Cooperation with authorities</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

#### Step 5: Make further adjustments to take into account the totality principle

29     To make further adjustments to take into account the totality principle to ensure that the aggregate sentence is not excessive or crushing. This would include considering which sentences would run consecutively or concurrently.

### Applying the proposed sentencing framework

30     Applying the proposed framework, the Prosecution submitted as follows:

#### Step 1: Assessing the offence-specific factors

##### (1)   The harm caused was severe

31     The Prosecution submitted that the harm caused was severe. The reasons highlighted included the following:

> (a)     The seriousness of a CBT offence generally increases with the value of property dishonestly misappropriated and in this case the amount of gasoil misappropriated was immense. Each proceeded charge involved quantities of gasoil between SGD1 million and over SGD4 million;

> (b)     The offence involved a strategic industry which is a vital component of Singapore’s economy and the offences had the potential to severely undermine Singapore’s reputation as a global maritime and commercial centre;

> (c)     The misappropriation by the accused and the co-conspirators were syndicated group offences and involved transnational elements. The misappropriated gasoil was sold to local and international buyers;

> (d)     The offences were very difficult to detect especially given the systematic steps taken to conceal the crimes. The syndicate also took steps to avoid detection. This included:

>> (i)       configuring the flow of the misappropriated gasoil through carefully planned routes to avoid custody transfer meters;

>> (ii)       ensuring that multiple pumps and tanks were operating at the same time to mask their actions;

>> (iii)       timing their misappropriation of gasoil carefully, for example, by pausing a legitimate loading of purchased gasoil in order to transfer misappropriated gasoil

##### (2)   The accused’s culpability was medium[^4]

32     Compared to the other members of the syndicate, the accused’s culpability was characterised as “medium”. The reasons for this characterisation are as follows:

> (a)     The accused played an important role in the enterprise. He was an active and willing participant. As the black oil panel man, he was responsible for opening and closing the valves as necessary, so that the misappropriated oil could be received by the waiting vessels without being detected. He also assisted in the MCR;

> (b)     He did not play a leadership or managerial role. Juandi, Muzzaffar and Koh were the masterminds while Cai and Tiah played crucial roles which effectively included “management” of the other co-conspirators. By comparison, the accused and Farhan took directions from the others;

> (c)     As he was charged with multiple offences committed between January 2014 and September 2016, over a span of some 32 months, he should not be considered a first-time offender;

> (d)     He betrayed the trust reposed to him by his employers and exploited the knowledge he had acquired as an employee for his own benefit;

> (e)     The accused’s personal profit from his participation in the criminal enterprise amounted to at least SGD700,000. Only a small portion was recovered (SGD374,000 and USD51,000).

#### Step 2: Determining the applicable indicative starting range

33     Having characterised the accused’s offences as falling within _medium culpability_ and _severe harm_, from the proposed sentencing matrix at \[26\], above, the Prosecution submitted that the broad indicative sentencing range for each charge was between 90 to 135 months’ imprisonment.

#### Step 3: Determining the applicable indicative starting point

34     Within the _medium culpability_ range, the Prosecution submitted that the accused should be placed at the lower end. He was not a mastermind (high culpability) or a “manager” (higher degree of _medium culpability_).

35     The Prosecution next distinguished the charges based on the amounts involved and proposed the following indicative starting points for each CBT charge:

#### Step 4: Considering the relevant offender-specific factors

36     The only aggravating factor highlighted by the Prosecution were the further nine similar CBT charges that were TIC.

37     The Prosecution acknowledged that by pleading guilty, the accused saved judicial resources that would otherwise be expended. He was also the first of the co-conspirators named in his charges to plead guilty.

38     Therefore, the Prosecution proposed an appropriate reduction for the starting points identified at \[35\], above, reflecting the accused’s remorse and co-operation. The Prosecution’s submission was for two of the CBT charges to run consecutively (highlighted) and the proposed sentences are as follows:

#### Step 5: Considering the global sentence and to make further adjustments to take into account the totality principle, if necessary.

39     As this step required the Court to consider the global sentence, the Prosecution proceeded to make their sentencing submissions for the CDSA charge.

##### (1)   The CDSA charge

40     The Prosecution submitted for a sentence of at least 10 months’ imprisonment for the CDSA charge. The Prosecution highlighted two precedents to show why this was an appropriate sentence:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="26.8%"> <col width="45.36%"> <col width="27.84%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Case</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Brief Facts</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentence</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><em>Chong Kum Heng v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24115-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGHC 21</a></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Offender pleaded guilty to six CDSA charges involving between SGD$9,000 and SGD$40,000.

##### (2)   The Global Sentence

41     In considering the appropriate global sentence, it was submitted that the Court should take into account the totality principle and ensure that the aggregate sentence is sufficient and proportionate to the accused’s overall criminality. The Court should examine if the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of individual offences committed, and whether the sentence is crushing and not keeping with the accused’s past record and future prospects. With this in mind, the Court would then determine which would be the sentences to run consecutively or concurrently and may also consider adjusting the individual sentences.

42     In the present case, the Prosecution did not submit for the sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment for the CDSA charge to run consecutively with the two CBT charges. Therefore, the submitted appropriate _global_ sentence in the present case, after considering all the factors, was a sentence of at least 120 months’ imprisonment.

43     To achieve this result, the Prosecution proposed that the sentences of imprisonment in _DAC-927415-2019_ and _DAC-927429-2020_ should run consecutively, making a total of 120 months’ imprisonment. It was submitted that these two charges were the most reflective of the accused’s offending.

44     It was submitted that although this would effectively double the length of the sentence as compared to a single charge, the global sentence would still be below that maximum term of imprisonment prescribed for a s 408 PC offence. Furthermore, when one considers the total amount involved, namely approximately SGD33 million, the proposed sentence did not offend totality principle. Given the accused’s relatively young age, , the proposed sentence would also not be crushing.

45     In addition, the Prosecution compared the proposed sentence with other relevant sentencing precedents. These included:

46     The Prosecution thus submitted that the submitted sentence of 120 months’ imprisonment in the instant case was appropriate and well justified.

## Plea in mitigation

### Mitigating factors

47     The following factors were highlighted to the Court:

> (a)     Culpability. Although this was not stated explicitly in the Plea in Mitigation, I am presuming that the Defence is submitting that the accused’s culpability was lower than what the Prosecution had assessed it to be. Within the group, the accused’s role was limited to taking directions from the ring leaders. This included opening and closing the bypass valve during the incidents so as to facilitate the transfer of gasoil as well as assisting in the MCR by operating the oil panel. His role was minor compared to other members of the group;[^5]

> (b)     Remorse. The accused was troubled with his involvement in the misappropriation and had reservations about continuing. He therefore requested a transfer to distance himself from the group and the illegal activities. The accused conceded that he received about SGD700,00 in proceeds (SGD10,000 - SGD15,000 per illegal loading). However, part of the proceeds was donated to charity to assuage his guilty conscience. The accused is unable to make full restitution of SGD700,000;

> (c)     Involvement. The misappropriation of gasoil was already ongoing when the accused was recruited into the syndicate. It continued even after the accused left on his own volition. The ringleaders distributed the proceeds to all members even if an individual was not present for an illegal loading. This was done to involve / implicate all members regardless of their actual involvement and entrench their commitment;

> (d)     Health issues. The accused was experiencing stress during this period due to issues in his personal and professional life. He was diagnosed with depression in January 2016.[^6]

### Sentencing submissions

48     The Defence did not accept the Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework. It was submitted that this was a “_novel & untested framework with unsubstantiated indicative sentencing ranges and starting points and highlight that the outcome may result in enhanced sentences – which is not the objective of a framework.”[^7]_

49     The Defence offered their own alternative. First, it was submitted that the starting point in sentencing an accused for a s 408 PC offence is the quantum involved and this ought to be the amount misappropriated.[^8] (per _PP v Pittis Stavros_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGDC 371</span> (“_Pittis (DC)_”) at \[107\].

50     The next step would be to consider factors that extend beyond the quantum misappropriated.[^9] In _Amir Hamzah bin Berang Kuty_ v PP <span class="citation">\[2002\] SGHC 307</span> (“_Amir_”), the High Court at \[60\] was of the view that

> “ …. **_in sentencing accused persons on charges of criminal breach of trust, the court’s discretion is never restricted by the amount involved. Each case must be looked at on its own facts. While guidelines and benchmark sentences do give some aid to ensure consistency in sentencing, the value of the property cannot, and will never, be the sole factor in determining the sentence_**. To do so would constrain the judges’ ability to give effect to the four general principles of retribution, deterrence, prevention and rehabilitation when passing out a sentence: see _Chua Tiong Tiong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 2 SLR(R) 515</span>; _PP v Tan Fook Sum_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 1 SLR(R) 1022</span> and _R v Sargeant_ (1974) 60 Cr App R 74.” (emphasis added)

51     The Defence highlighted that amount the accused benefitted from the criminal enterprise (ie. SGD700,000), was but about 2% of the total quantum involved (ie. SGD33.5 million). In _Pittis Stavros v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 67</span> (“_Pittis (HC)_”), The loss caused to the victim company was $153,358.51 but the accused benefitted $26,000 from the misappropriation. The High Court at \[66\] of _Pittis (HC)_ accepted this as a reason for a downward adjustment to the final sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment (down from the indicative sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment)[^10].

52     Furthermore, the Defence stressed that, although the accused was unable to make restitution in the sum of SGD700,00, the Prosecution had already seized property and assets belonging to the accused which totalled about SGD440,000[^11]. This should therefore be considered in determining the appropriate sentence.

53     In order to provide the Court with an indicative sentence, the Defence proceeded to cite two precedents to assist the Court:

55     The Defence submitted for the sentences of imprisonment in _DAC-927412-2019_ and _DAC-927413-2019_ to run consecutively, making a global sentence of 6 years’ imprisonment. It was submitted that this balanced collective blame with personal culpability and is appropriate for this accused. The proposed sentence was commensurate for this offence and was proportionate with the precedents.[^12]

56     I note that the Defence did not make any submission on sentence with respect to the CDSA charge.

## Sentencing Considerations

### Punishment prescribed by law

57     The punishment prescribed by law for an offence of CBT by a servant under s 408 of the PC is a term of imprisonment of up to 15 years and a discretionary fine. Under s 109 of the PC, whoever abets in the commission of any offence shall be punished with the punishment provided for the offence.

58     The punishment prescribed by law for an offence under s 47(1) CDSA is found at s 47(6). This provides that an individual convicted may be sentenced to a fine not exceeding $500,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or to both. In addition, as the CDSA charge is an amalgamated charge, s 124(8)(ii) of the CPC provides that the court may sentence the person to 2 times the amount of punishment to which that person would otherwise have been liable if that person had been charged with and convicted of any one of the incidents of commission of the offence.

### A sentencing framework and matrix : The CBT charges

59     The accused had pleaded guilty to nine charges under s 408 of the PC. I agreed with the Prosecution that a sentencing framework could be adopted and applied in the present case, similar to the framework used in other cases involving property related offences such as cheating at play[^13], and acquiring, possessing, transferring etc. the benefits of criminal conduct[^14].

60     The Prosecution’s proposed 5-step approach was similar to the framework used in _Huang Ying-Chun_ at \[98\], which was itself adapted from the framework in _Logachev Vladislav_.

61     At this juncture, I would highlight that the framework proposed by the Prosecution for use in the instant case was also proposed and applied when I adopted it in sentencing the offender in _Sadagopan_, a co-conspirator, to a total of 80 months’ imprisonment for similar CBT offences under s 408 of the PC. The co-conspirator was sentenced the same day I sentenced the accused.

#### Step 1: Assessing the offence-specific factors

62     I agreed with the Prosecution that the harm caused was severe. The syndicate caused huge losses to Shell, with the accused being directly involved in excess of SGD33.5 million. By whatever metric one used, there is no escaping that SGD33.5 million is an extremely large amount.

63     At this point, I should highlight that the only offence-specific aggravating factor highlighted by the Prosecution that I would disagree with is the characterization that the offences involved a _“transnational element”_.[^15] While it may be true that the ship Captains involved may have been foreign nationals and perhaps even maybe the vessels involved may have been foreign flagged, the illegal loading of gasoil all occurred within Singapore’s territorial waters, namely in the waters around Shell PB.

64     I also accepted the Prosecution’s assessment that the accused’s culpability was at the low end of “medium”.[^16] However, I adjudged that this would not be on the extreme low end of “medium”. The accused was recruited into the syndicated when it was already in existence. He remained with the syndicate for about 32 months, not a short period of time by any measure, but shorter only _vis-à-vis_ several other co-conspirators, in particular the key members. but objectively speaking, it was not really a short period of time. All considered, while his culpability was assessed as being “medium”, it was still significant.

65     The Defence had submitted that the accused was less culpable because the amount that he benefitted from his involvement (SGD700,000) was only a small proportion of the large amount (hence, value) of gasoil misappropriated (SGD33.5 million).[^17] I did not agree. At the end of the day, the accused was involved in a conspiracy and was responsible for the collective actions of the group. Whether the amount misappropriated was SGD33.50 or SGD33.5 million, that whole amount would be attributable to each and every member of the conspiracy, including the accused.

66     At the end of the day, it is undeniable that the accused profited from the acts of the syndicate. The benefit that he received cannot be viewed in isolation but set against the role the accused played within the syndicate. It seems curious that, having benefitted from the conspiracy for more than two and a half years, the accused is now saying that he has a lesser culpability than his co-conspirators simply because he was given a smaller slice of cake that he and the co-conspirators had stolen.

67     Next, the Defence characterised the accused as a “pawn”.[^18] It is my view this was a mischaracterization of the accused’s involvement. It suggested that the accused had the least value on the chessboard of the conspiracy and was, perhaps, _unwittingly_ used in the scheme, and taken advantage of. He was not. While the accused was not at the top, neither was he at the near the bottom of the conspiracy’s hierarchy. He clearly knew what was going on and was an _active_ participant, benefitting from the enterprise.

68     The Defence submitted that the accused’s role was limited to taking directions from the ringleaders. This included opening and closing the bypass valve during the incidents so as to facilitate the transfer of gasoil as well as assisting in the MCR by operating the oil panel. His role and involvement were minor compared to the other members of the group.[^19] I do agree that “_his role and involvement were minor_” but as highlighted, it was only minor in relation to the **_other members of the syndicate_**. Further, the misappropriation of gasoil was a sophisticated endeavour. It occurred over a substantial period of time, in a premeditated and methodical manner.[^20] Whether his role was characterized as minor or not, it was nonetheless an important one.

69     Although the Defence conceded that the accused bore responsibility for continuing with the group and failing to disengage sooner, it was nonetheless submitted that the accused felt obligated to continue in the syndicate or risk facing backlash because the ringleaders had distributed the proceeds to all members even if an individual was not present for an illegal loading to involve / implicate all members regardless of their actual involvement and entrench their commitment.[^21] I did not think that this factor warranted the lowering of the accused’s culpability to the extent that the Defence would like it to be lowered by. At best, it reduced his culpability marginally. The accused always had a choice. To join the syndicate or not. To report the activities of the syndicate to the relevant authorities or not. Thereafter, having joined the syndicate, there was a choice for him to decide when to leave the syndicate. It seems slightly disingenuous that, having benefitted from the way the syndicate distributed its “profits” for such a prolonged period, the accused now points to the same distribution scheme as, at least being partly responsible, for him not leaving the syndicate earlier.

#### Steps 2 and 3: The indicative sentencing range and the indicative starting point

70     As highlighted at \[48\] of these Grounds, the Defence did not accept the Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework. However, neither did the Defence propose any alternative. Instead, to arrive at its proposed sentence, the Defence urged the Court to considering the following;

> (a)     The starting point, which is the amount misappropriated;[^22]

> (b)     The accused’s culpability, including the proportion of the amount misappropriated that the accused benefitted from[^23], the role he played etc;

> (c)     The relevant sentencing precedents, to reach the appropriate sentence.

71     I had to disagree with the proposition. First, while there are no High Court decisions setting out what are the indicative sentencing ranges in such a framework, the Prosecution’s proposed 5-step approach is similar to the framework used in _Huang Ying-Chun_ at \[98\], which was itself adapted from the framework in _Logachev Vladislav_. Looking at the indicative sentencing ranges proposed, I was of the view that they were logical and provided with a consistent stepped approach in the culpability / harm matrix.

72     Second, as stated earlier, I disagreed with what the Defence appeared to suggest, namely that significant weight should be placed how much an accused had benefitted from the criminal enterprise. Third, and perhaps more importantly, the Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework utilises the entire sentencing range available for an offence under s 408 of the PC, that is to say, up to 15 years’ imprisonment. The approach put forward by the Defence does not. Instead, I am if the view that the Defence’s approach would be unnecessarily constraint by the existence (or lack) of sentencing precedents of the amount misappropriated.

73     For the aforesaid reasons, I agreed with the sentencing _matrix_ proposed by the Prosecution and proceeded to adopt it. Having assessed that the culpability of the offender was low side of medium and that the harm caused was severe, each charge therefore fell within the _medium culpability_ and _severe harm_ classification, giving a sentencing range on the lower end of the sentencing range of 90 to 135 months’ imprisonment.

74     Having identified the indicative sentencing range, the third step is to identify the appropriate starting point within the range. Here, the offence-specific factors are again examined, but this time with the object of granulating the case before the court to identify the specific sentence that is appropriate as a starting point in that particular case.[^24] I did so and accepted the indicative _starting_ points for the individual charges proposed by the Prosecution. Although this had been set out earlier, I have, for convenience, have reproduced the table below:

#### Step 4: Assessing the offender-specific factors

75     I accepted that it appeared that the main aggravating factor in this case was the fact that the accused had nine other similar TIC charges.

76     On the other hand, the fact that the accused had pleaded guilty was a major mitigating factor. As noted by the Prosecution, he had demonstrated genuine remorse and had saved judicial and prosecutorial resources that would otherwise have been expended. He also cooperated with the authorities in their investigations.[^25]

77     I accepted the fact that the accused had left the syndicate on his own volition had some mitigatory value. However, I am of the view that this was minimal. From the medical reports[^26], I am unable to conclude that the reason why the accused left the syndicate when he did was due to his _“…. involvement in the misappropriation and had reservations about continuing …_”[^27]. A perusal of the two medical reports suggested that the accused left the syndicate mainly because of personal reasons rather than because of any remorse or guilt. Furthermore, the accused leaving the syndicate when he did must also be looked at against the backdrop of the fact that he chose to remain silent after he left, allowing the syndicate to continue its work unabated.

78     Finally, I also considered the accused’s personal circumstances as set out in the Plea-in-Mitigation in the analysis of what were the appropriate sentences for the individual CBT offences.

79     Accordingly, I agreed with the Prosecution’s proposal of an appropriate reduction from the starting points for the individual charges identified at \[74\], above. I found that the Prosecution’s proposed sentences to be fair and reasonable after considering all the factors of the case. Once again, for convenience, the proposed sentences are again set out below, with the two proposed consecutive sentences, namely, _DAC-927415-2019_ and _DAC-927429-2019_, highlighted :

#### Step 5: The global sentence and making further adjustments to take into account the totality principle

80     At this point, I proceeded to determine the appropriate sentence of the CDSA charge before making further adjustments to take into account the totality principle.

##### (1)   The CDSA charge

81     For the amount of SGD191,703.14 in the CDSA charge, the Prosecution sought a sentence of at least 10 months’ imprisonment. As mentioned, no sentencing submission was made by Defence.

82     I was of the view that the Prosecution’s proposed sentence for the CDSA charge was fair and appropriate. In addition to the two cases that were cited by the Prosecution, I also proceeded to review several other precedents involving offences under s 47(1)(b) of the CDSA in determining the appropriate sentence. These precedents involved similar amounts of monies and included the following:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="26.8%"> <col width="43.3%"> <col width="29.9%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Case</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Brief Facts</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentence</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><em>PP v Bahurudeen Kuthpudeen</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22267-SSP.xml')">[2018] SGDC 260</a></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Offender pleaded guilty to one s 408 PC charge and one CDSA charge.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">He had committed CBT of SGD469,000 from his employer, a moneychanger.

83     In the final analysis, I therefore adjudged that the submitted sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment was fair and appropriate in the circumstances.

##### (2)   The Global Sentence

84     Having now determined the appropriate sentence for the CDSA charge, I next considered the appropriate global sentence.

85     The Court is required to run two sentences of imprisonment consecutively, per s 307(1) of the CPC. I agreed with the Prosecution that running two of the proposed CBT sentences of 60 months’ imprisonment would be sufficient to reflect the criminality of the offences _viz_ the accused’s culpability. I accepted that the sentence of imprisonment for the CDSA charge should be run concurrently. The monies involved were obtained from the acts that formed the basis of the CBT charges. In addition, I found that the global sentence of 120 months’ imprisonment submitted by the Prosecution was in line with the precedents highlighted.

86     In _Sadagopan_, a co-conspirator, the offender was assessed to be of _low_ culpability (compared to _medium_ culpability in this case) pleaded guilty to four similar CBT charges. Although the total number of charges was less, the total value of gasoil misappropriated was higher than in the present case. The co-conspirator was sentenced to a total of 80 months’ imprisonment. Therefore, while the global sentence of 6 years’ imprisonment submitted by the Defence may, at first glance appear adequate, it did not in my opinion, however, reflect the criminality of the offences committed nor the accused’s overall culpability. Considering all the factors, the Defence’s proposed global sentence of 6 years’ imprisonment in the present case was therefore untenable in light of the co-conspirator’s sentence in _Sadagopan_.

87     Notwithstanding the above, I took a final look at the individual and global sentence proposed by the Prosecution. I was of the view that several of the individual sentences could be adjusted slightly downwards and that a further discount was perhaps warranted for the global sentence. This would, in my view, be a more appropriate reflection of the accused overall culpability in the instant case. I adjudged, therefore, that a further reduction of six months’ imprisonment in the proposed global sentence of 120 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate.

## The final sentence

88     For the reasons above, the final sentence that was imposed on the accused were as follows:

89     In order to achieve the global sentence of 114 months’ imprisonment that I adjudged was appropriate, I ordered that the sentences of imprisonment in _DAC-927415-2019_ and _DAC-927428-2019_ to run consecutively. The total sentence imposed was therefore:

> **114 months’ imprisonment with effect from 5 July 2021**

90     The accused, being dissatisfied with the sentence that I have imposed, has since appealed against it. He is presently serving sentence.
