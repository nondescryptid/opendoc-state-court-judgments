## Statement of Facts

5       The accused admitted to the following consolidated Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification.

1.    The accused is **Khoo Wai Keong** (“the accused”), male / 32 years old, Singaporean, bearing NRIC No. xxx.

2.    On 10 September 2017 at about 2.27 a.m., the police received a call, stating, “_There is a fight along the road”._ The location of the incident was given as at Shanghai Dolly Club located at No. 3B River Valley Road, #01-01 Clarke Quay, Singapore.

**FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 1ST CHARGE IN MAC-902594-2018**

3.    The victim is Lim Teck Meng (“Teck Meng”), male, 50 years old, Singaporean.

4.    On 10 September 2017 at or about 2.00 a.m., Teck Meng had finished drinking at Shanghai Dolly Club (“the club”) and was waiting for a taxi outside the said club when the accused approached him from the front, and kept shouting “369!” in Hokkien. Thereat, the accused suddenly threw several punches on Teck Meng’s face, causing the latter to fall onto the floor. The accused knew at that juncture that he was likely to cause hurt to Teck Meng. The accused then left Teck Meng alone and punched two other unknown passers-by nearby.

5.    Teck Meng subsequently sought medical attention at the Acute Care Clinic at Alexandra Hospital on 10 September 2017 at about 4.11 a.m. where Dr. Savan K. de Silva attended to him. In his report dated 4 October 2017, Dr. de Silva noted that Teck Meng had minor abrasion under the left nostril and minor tenderness over the left maxillary region. Teck Meng was diagnosed with facial contusion secondary to assault. He was discharged with analgesics. The report is attached at Annex A.

6.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has thereby committed an offence of voluntarily causing hurt, which is an offence punishable under section 323 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (Rev. Ed. 2008) (“Penal Code”).

**FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 2ND CHARGE IN MAC-902595-2018**

7.    The victim is Lee Meng Yew (“Meng Yew”), male, 38 years old, Singaporean.

8.    On 10 September 2017 at about 2.05 a.m., Meng Yew had arrived at the club and was waiting with his friend for the valet to park his friend’s car. The accused suddenly approached Meng Yew from the side and started scolding Meng Yew for no reason. The accused then threw a punch at Meng Yew, which Meng Yew was able to block with his right hand. The accused then tried to punch Meng Yew several times more and managed to land a punch with his left fist on Meng Yew’s forehead. At that juncture, the accused knew that he was likely to cause hurt to Meng Yew.

9.    Meng Yew’s friend intervened and managed to separate the accused and Meng Yew. The accused then walked towards the main road next to the club and got into an argument with an unknown male subject.

10.    Meng Yew did not seek medical attention subsequently because he only felt soreness in his forehead.

11.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has thereby committed an offence of voluntarily causing hurt, which is an offence punishable under section 323 of the Penal Code.

**FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 5TH CHARGE IN DAC-910370-2018**

12.    The victim is Angel Chin Hui Shan (“Angel”), female, 28 years old, Singaporean. She was a police officer attached to the Orchard Neighbourhood Police Centre at the material time.

13.    On 10 September 2017 at about 2.45 a.m., Angel was conducting her patrol duties when she received a request of back-up from other police officers. She then proceeded to the incident location.

14.    Upon arrival at or about 2.53 a.m., she saw that the accused was shouting loudly and gesturing with his hands at the police officers who had attended to the scene outside the club. Despite being warned several times to not create a scene in a public place, the accused did not comply and kept shouting and challenging the police officers to arrest him.

15.    The police officers then handcuffed the accused. As the accused refused to walk, the officers (except Angel) carried the accused to the taxi-stand nearby while Angel drove the patrol car to the main road in front of the taxi-stand where the accused was at.

16.    As the accused refused to get into the patrol car, Angel alighted from the car and assisted the other police officers in carrying the accused into the car. The accused lay on the rear passenger seats and refused to sit upright. When Angel tried to place the accused’s legs in the car, the accused kicked Angel once over her abdomen, with the knowledge that he was likely to cause hurt to Angel.

17.    Angel subsequently sought medical attention at the Emergency Department of Tan Tock Seng Hospital on 10 September 2017 at about 4.42 a.m. where Dr. Danny Louie attended to her. In his report dated 11 October 2017, Dr. Louie noted that Angel had no abdominal tenderness or obvious abdominal injuries. She was discharged with analgesics. The report is attached at Annex B.

18.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has thereby committed an offence of voluntarily causing hurt to a public servant in the discharge of her duty as such public servant, which is an offence punishable under section 332 of the Penal Code.

19.    The accused stands charge.

## Antecedents

7       The accused is untraced.

## Prosecution’s Submission on Sentence

8       The prosecution submitted for a sentence of three months’ imprisonment for the section 332 charge; two weeks’ imprisonment for the 1st section 323 charge; and one week’s imprisonment for the 2nd section 323 charge. The learned APP urged the court to order the section 332 charge and the 1st section 323 charge to run consecutively, and sought a global sentence of three months and two weeks’ imprisonment.

9       The learned APP highlighted several aggravating factors; namely, that there were a total of four victims in this case. Secondly, the accused was clearly the aggressor and had assaulted the two victims of the 1st and 2nd charges on the face and head, and that these are vulnerable parts of the body. Thirdly, the attacks were completely unprovoked. Fourthly, the accused was intoxicated when he committed the offences.

10     The learned APP also tendered sentencing precedents in support of the sentences of three months’ imprisonment for the section 332 charge for first offenders where the assault is relatively minor. In reply to the mitigation, the learned APP urged the court not to give any weight to the medical report by Dr Tommy Tan and submitted that there was no mental disorder and that there was no causal link to the offence. The prosecution further submitted that there were no exceptional factors to warrant a non-custodial sentence. There were also two other TIC charges and the prosecution submitted that the custodial threshold is crossed having regard to the principle of deterrence.

## Mitigation

11     The learned counsel for the accused submitted for a non-custodial sentence. To this end, the learned counsel highlighted that the accused had pleaded guilty, and was deeply remorseful for what he had done. He had sought to apologize to the victims and paid $500 as compensation for the medical expenses. He had an unblemished record.

12     The learned counsel relied on the medical reports from Dr Tommy Tan that the accused has persistent depressive disorder, early onset since childhood, has alcohol use disorder, and alcohol intoxication at the material time. The learned counsel further highlighted the events leading up to the incident in question, including the accused’s financial stresses, his involvement in a chain collision accident involving six vehicles, and having an argument with his girlfriend before he went to the Shanghai Dolly for drinks. The accused did not have a clear recollection of what happened during the incident in question given his intoxicated state.

13     Finally, hs learned counsel highlighted that the accused had sought self-help to counter his disorder and had taken proactive steps and has been receiving addiction counselling, attending treatment and consultation sessions with his psychiatrist to ensure that such incidents never happen again.

14     His learned counsel also sought to rely on the case of _PP v Soon Nyet Chin_ (“_Soon Nyet Chin”_) and sought for a non-custodial sentence.

## Reasons for the Sentence Imposed

#### The Principle of Deterrence

15     In deciding on the appropriate sentence to impose, I took into account the accused’s guilty plea and the mitigation plea submitted on his behalf by his learned counsel seeking for a non-custodial term. In particular, his learned counsel highlighted the medical report of Dr Tommy Tan and the accused’s persistent depressive disorder and the alcohol use disorder, and that the accused was intoxicated at the time of the commission of the offence. I shall deal with these factors in greater detail below.

16     First, I considered the sentencing precedents for cases involving assaults against police officers, and the sentencing benchmarks submitted by the parties. In this regard, the predominant sentencing consideration must be one of deterrence, both general and specific deterrence. In my view, the court must send a clear signal that assault on public servants and police officers while in the discharge of their duties would not be tolerated. There is clearly a public interest to ensure that police officers will be protected adequately by the law that they uphold. Furthermore, incidents of assaults against police officers are also an attack on their authority. If left unchecked, it could seriously undermine the public confidence in our police officers, and compromise their effectiveness in maintaining law and order.

17     In this regard, I am mindful of the leading case of _PP v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey_ (“_Jeffrey Yeo_”), decided by the High Court comprising of Three Judges, which indicated that in most cases of section 332 involving an assault against a public servant, in this case, a police officer, the custody threshold is usually crossed and a custodial sentence is warranted. In other words, one can expect to receive an imprisonment term following an assault of a police officer.

18     As stated at paragraph 50 of the judgment, police officers must be assured of adequate protection and vindication by the law against behaviour that might compromise the effective discharge of their duties. In that light, the High Court formulated a sentencing framework for a section 332 offence to reflect society’s opprobrium of such cases, and to aid the lower courts in sentencing in such cases and help maintain uniformity in the sentences.

19     It should be stated that the framework applied to cases of causing hurt to police officers and public servants who are performing duties akin to police duties. The sentencing band for Category 1 (i.e. lesser harm and lower culpability circumstances) encompassed the existing sentencing norm of two to nine months’ imprisonment. The High Court stated that this would remain the indicative starting point for most cases involving causing hurt to police officers. Fines should be meted out only in very exceptional cases, where the offending act ranks the lowest in the harm-and-culpability spectrum.

20     In this case, the facts revealed that after the accused was arrested and handcuffed by the police officers, the accused refused to walk and had to be carried to a taxi-stand nearby, while the female police officer victim drove the patrol car in front of the taxi-stand. The accused refused to get into the patrol car and had to be carried into the rear passenger seats. Even then, the accused refused to sit upright and kicked the victim once over her abdomen when she tried to place his legs into the car. From the medical examination, there were no abdominal tenderness or obvious abdominal injuries and the police officer was discharged with analgesics. Given these circumstances, parties agreed that the offending act would fall within Category 1 of the sentencing band.

21     In surveying the cases prosecuted under this category, the High Court observed that the custodial threshold is generally crossed for offences under section 332 of the Penal Code. Fines would only be appropriate at the lowest end of the harm-and-culpability spectrum. This sentencing option should generally be available only to young offenders or offenders with some mental disorder.

#### Soon Nyet Chin’s case distinguished

22     The learned counsel relied on Soon Nyet Chin’s case and submitted that there are significant similarities between that case and the present case. As such, his learned counsel submitted that the accused should similarly be given a non-custodial sentence. I disagreed for the following reasons.

23     First, the facts and circumstances of Soon Nyet Chin’s case were quite unique and different from the present case. In that case, the accused, a 54-year old woman, was behaving abnormally and out of character when she entered a karaoke room filled with strangers and hugged a 5-year old child whom she was not acquainted with. When she was confronted by the child’s parents, the accused responded with a disproportionate display of violence and aggression.

24     The learned District Judge in that case was of the view that there were special facts which warranted a non-custodial sentence as it was evident from the psychiatrist’s report that her actions were a consequence of her mental condition in that she suffered from a relapsed of her Major Depressive illness – Major Depressive Episode, Recurrent, Without Psychotic Symptoms as a result of increased environmental stress. She also had a positive family history of depression. Her psychiatrist also diagnosed her of having alcohol use disorder and stated in the report that the accused was suffering from alcohol intoxication and an alcoholic blackout during the commission of the offences. Her psychiatrist also opined that the risk of repeating a similar offence was negligible and that the offence was not premediated but a one-off atypical occurrence.

25     In the present case, I noted that the accused had poor anger management but did not continue his follow-up with his psychiatrist because he thought he could control his temper better. When he drank alcohol and became drunk, he would lose his temper very badly and become aggressive at anyone, including his girlfriend. In my view, the accused’s drinking alcohol excessively to cope with his chronic low mood and chronic low self-esteem was entirely voluntary. Despite knowing that he would not be able to control his anger and aggression, or that drinking would make it worse, the accused continued to drink until he became drunk. To that extent, I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that the accused’s persistent depressive disorder, had no or very little causal link to the offences in question.

26     Secondly, as highlighted by the prosecution, the accused was clearly the aggressor and the attacks against the victims were completely unprovoked. In Soon Nyet Chin’s case, the victim and her husband had shouted at the accused to let go of their child, which in turn provoked a response from the accused. She then kicked the victim, charged at her and bit her toe, refusing to let go until the victim’s husband managed to force open the accused’s mouth.

27     Thirdly, while the prosecution in Soon Nyet Chin’s case had objected to an order of probation, they did not press for a custodial sentence, and had indicated to the court that they had no objections to a fine. In my view, this could have had a bearing in the final decision of the learned District Judge to exercise her discretion to impose a fine of $10,000 for the section 332 charge. Suffice for me to note, the prosecution subsequently discontinued the appeal against the fines imposed and the matter did not proceed to the High Court.

28     In the present case, the prosecution has submitted for a global sentence of 3 months’ and 2 weeks’ imprisonment term, highlighting several aggravating factors present in this case. Whilst the court is not bound to accept the sentencing indications of either the prosecution or defence, I agreed with the prosecution that a custodial sentence would be inappropriate in this case.

29     As emphasized by the Court of Three Judges in _Jeffrey Yeo_, given the factually diverse ways in which offences under section 332 present themselves, it is not possible to identify exhaustively the features of cases for which particular types or lengths of sentences will be appropriate. The appropriate sentence will always be the product of a fact-sensitive and sensible exercise of discretion.

30     In my view, the key issue before the court is really whether the mitigating factors put forth by the accused’s learned counsel were so substantial and so exceptional that it would warrant a departure from the imposition of a custodial sentence in this case.

31     Having carefully considered the matter and the medical reports of Dr Tommy Tan, I was of the view that the mitigation plea was not so substantial or so exceptional as to warrant a departure from a non-custodial sentence.

32     Having said that, I was also mindful that this was the accused’s first brush with the law, and that he has taken proactive steps to ensure that he does not repeat his offence. To that extent, I agreed with the learned defence counsel’s submission that the imprisonment terms sought by the prosecution for the proceeded charges may appear to be somewhat on a high side at first blush.

33     Accordingly, I calibrated the imprisonment term for the section 332 charge downwards and imposed a custodial sentence of 2 months’ imprisonment, which in my view is in line with the indicative starting point sentences.

34     I should add that in the course of preparing the Grounds of Decision, it has come to my attention that whilst the accused was on bail pending appeal, he was charged and convicted of a drink-driving offence under section 67(1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276 (vide DAC 901428-2019). The offence took place on 29 December 2018 at about 2.10am along Crawford Street towards Lavender Street where he was stopped at a police road block, barely two months after he went on bail pending the appeal. He was fined $1500 and disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 15 months with effect from 14 February 2019.

35     While the fresh offence is dissimilar to the present set of offences, quite clearly, the accused had not kept to his mitigation plea that he had stopped drinking alcohol after the incident at Clark Quay on 10 September 2017. His actions of drinking and driving also did not sit well with his plans to apply to be a Grab taxi driver to supplement his monthly income as told to the court.

36     As for the other two charges of voluntarily causing hurt, the prosecution submitted for a short custodial sentence. As highlighted by the prosecution, the accused was clearly the aggressor in this case. The attacks were completely unprovoked when the unsuspecting first victim was waiting for a taxi outside the club. The accused suddenly punched the victim several times on the face and causing the victim to fall onto the floor before the accused went on to assault two other passers-by.

37     In this regard, I also noted that prior to the attack, the accused kept shouting “369” in Hokkien. To that extent, the unprovoked assault by the accused conveyed with it an undertone of secret society antics. Insofar as the second victim was concerned, he was able to block the accused’s punches and the victim’s friend intervened to separate both of them.

38     Finally, as pointed out by the prosecution, the accused committed the offence whilst in a state of intoxication. In the landmark case of _Wong Hoi Len v PP_ ; , V K Rajah JA (as he then was), in setting the starting custodial sentencing benchmark for an assault on public transport worker held that a sentencing judge “should ordinarily take into account an offender’s intoxication as an aggravating consideration” and that “those who voluntarily imbibe alcohol must, in the usual course of events, take full responsibility for their subsequent offending”. The accused knew full well of the consequences of his binge drinking and bad temper when drunk, and should be prepared to accept the responsibility for his behaviour.

39     However, having regard to the minor injuries suffered by the victim for the first section 323 charge, I disagreed with the prosecution’s submission and I was not minded to impose a custodial sentence. In my view, a high fine would be a sufficient punishment. Accordingly, I imposed a fine of $3,000 in default 3 weeks’ imprisonment for the first charge of voluntarily causing hurt for punching the victim several times on the face.

40     For the second charge of voluntarily causing hurt for punching the victim once on the forehead, for the same reasons as stated above, I imposed a lower fine of $2,000 in default 2 weeks’ imprisonment.

41     In the final analysis, whilst I was prepared to impose a fine for the section 323 charges, the sentencing considerations for the section 332 charge far outweighed the personal mitigation of the accused to warrant a departure from the established sentencing norm of a custodial sentence. In my view, the mitigating factors or circumstances of the accused were not exceptional for the court to impose a fine for this charge as submitted by his learned counsel.

42     The accused being dissatisfied with the sentences have filed a Notice of Appeal. The accused is currently on bail pending appeal. The court also granted the accused’s application for a stay of execution of both the imprisonment term and fines imposed.
