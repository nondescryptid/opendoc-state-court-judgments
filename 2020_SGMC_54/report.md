### District Judge Christopher Goh Eng Chiang:

## Introduction

1       The accused was sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment for one charge of disorderly behaviour under s 20 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184) (“MOA”). In addition, I imposed an enhanced sentenced of 180 days’ imprisonment under s 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act (Cap 247) (“Prisons Act’).

2       The accused, being dissatisfied with the sentence that I had imposed, has appealed against it.

## The Charge

3       The accused pleaded guilty to the following charge:

> “ are charged that you, on the 19th day of September 2020, at about 8.15pm, outside Chai Chee Neighbourhood Police Post located at Apt Blk 35 Chai Chee Avenue #01-256/258, Singapore, a public place, did behave in a disorderly manner, to wit, by throwing a can of beer at the glass door of Chai Chee Neighbourhood Police Post, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 20 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act, Chapter 184.

> And further that you, before the commission of the aforesaid offence, that is to say on the 25th day of April 2006, you had been convicted in Court No. 23 of the State Courts, Singapore, for an offence of Disorderly Behaviour under Section 20 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act, Chapter 184, vide MAC-1794-06, and was sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment, which conviction had not been set aside and that you are hereby liable for enhanced punishment under Section 20 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act, Chapter 184.

> And further, that you, from the 19th day of September 2020 to 16th day of September 2021, were subject to a remission order made by the Commissioner of Prisons under Division 2 of Part VB of the Prisons Act (Cap. 247, Rev. Ed. 2000) which remission order is subject to the basic condition under section 50S(1) of the Prisons Act and while the remission order is in effect you, on the 19th day of September 2020, committed the aforesaid offence and upon conviction and the imposition of a sentence reflected under section 50S(1)(b) of the Prisons Act, shall be deemed to have breached the basic condition of your remission order, and you are thereby liable to be punished under section 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of 363 days from 19th day of September 2020 to 16th day of September 2021 for that offence.”

## The Statement of Facts

4       The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification. A summary of the facts is set out below.

5       On 19 September 2020, the accused was released from prison sometime in the afternoon. He was placed on a conditional remission order where he was subjected to the basic condition under s 50S(1) of the Prisons Act.

6       Immediately after his release, the accused went for a drink and started consuming alcohol. When he returned home, he had a dispute with his family members. He then went over to the nearby Chai Chee Neighbourhood Police Post (“NPP”) to seek assistance. As the police officer at the NPP, one Jonathan Lim, was attending to another complainant, he was unable to attend to the accused. The accused then walked out of the NPP, leaving his NRIC at the counter. When the police officer tried to return the NRIC, the accused refused to take it and threw it on the floor.

7       The accused returned to the NPP at 2015 hrs with a can of beer in his hand. He tried to open the glass door of the NPP but it was closed and locked. Being unable to open it, the accused behaved in a disorderly manner by throwing the can of beer at the glass door and walked away. The accused was subsequently arrested. There was no damage to the glass door.

8       The accused’s blood sample was subsequently taken and upon analysis, it was found to contain 158 mg/100 ml of ethanol.

9       As the accused had previously been convicted for the same offence, which conviction has not been set aside, he was liable for the enhanced punishment prescribed under s 20 of the MOA. In addition, as the accused is deemed to have breached the basic condition of his remission order, he was also liable to be punished under s 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act.

## Antecedents

10     The accused has a long list of antecedents. They included five previous convictions under s 20 of the MOA. The antecedents are set out in the table below:

## Submissions on sentence & plea in mitigation

### Prosecution’s submissions

11     The prosecution submitted that the appropriate sentence for the s 20 MOA disorderly behaviour charge was the maximum sentence prescribed by law of 12 months’ imprisonment. In justifying this submission, the prosecution highlighted that this was his sixth conviction under s 20 of the MOA. His five previous convictions under s 20 of the MOA are highlighted below;

12     The prosecution also urged the court to consider the aggravating factors in the case. These were that:

> (a)     he was intoxicated (blood ethanol content 158 mg/100 ml);

> (b)     the offence was committed without any provocation;

> (c)     the offence was committed outside a police establishment; and

> (d)     he committed the offence on the day he was released from prison.

### Mitigation plea

13     It was a brief plea in mitigation from the accused. He was in person. He expressed his remorse for what happened. He apologized to the court and said that the incident happened because he was drunk.

## Sentencing Considerations

### The punishment prescribed by law

14     The punishment prescribed by law for a subsequent offence of disorderly behaviour under s 20 of the MOA is a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment not exceeding 12 months of both.

15     In addition to this, the accused was liable to an enhanced sentence of a term of imprisonment not exceeding 363 days for breaching the basic condition of his remission order under s 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act.

### Sentence for disorderly behaviour under s 20 MOA

16     The accused has numerous previous convictions for disorderly behaviour. This was his sixth. I agreed with the prosecution that this, and that the offence was committed on the same day he was released from prison were aggravating factors. While there should be an uplift over the previous sentence of six months’ imprisonment, the submitted uplift of six months’ imprisonment by the prosecution was on the high side, even for a sixth offender.

17     I reviewed precedent cases in order to determine the appropriate uplift. Whilst there are many instances of accused persons being convicted for disorderly behaviour, there were very few who have been convicted as often as the accused in the present case.

18     In _Public Prosecutor v Arunmugan S/O Maruthamuthu_ (MAC-909159-2019) (_“Arunmugan”_), the accused was convicted for the seventh time for disorderly behaviour under s 20 of the MOA. He was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment. His previous disorderly behaviour convictions were as follows:

19     In _Public Prosecutor v Jasvinder Singh S/O Mehar Singh_ (MAC-903897-2019) (_“Jasvinder”_) the accused was convicted for the seventh time for disorderly behaviour under s 20 of the MOA. He was sentenced to four months’ imprisonment. His previous disorderly behaviour convictions were as follows:

20     Like the accused person in the present case, the accused persons in both _Arunmugan_ and _Jasvinder_ also had numerous public order antecedents in addition to the disorderly behaviour convictions. In each case, the uplift imposed by the court for each subsequent offence was two months’ imprisonment.

21     In determining the appropriate uplift from his previous sentence for disorderly behaviour, I took note of the following factors, including:

> (a)     that the fifth conviction for disorderly behaviour was committed some 14 years previously in 2006. I note, however, that the accused has spent much of the intervening 14 years in prison, as per his criminal record set out at \[10\], above;

> (b)     that his present offence under s 20 of the MOA was for disorderly behaviour, as opposed to the more serious offence of riotous behaviour under the same section;

> (c)     his early plea of guilt;

> (d)     the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence.

22     As such, I adjudged that the appropriate uplift was two months’ imprisonment, as per _Arunmugan_ and _Jasvinder_. I did not think that there were any relevant mitigating factors to warrant a downward adjustment of the sentence. Accordingly, I sentenced the accused to eight months’ imprisonment for the offence of disorderly behaviour under s 20 of the MOA.

### Enhanced sentence under s 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act

23     The accused faced a maximum enhanced sentence of 363 days’ imprisonment under s 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act. The prosecution urged the court to impose this in full. However, the prosecution did not fully articulate the reason for this submission except for the fact that the accused committed the offence on the day of his release.

#### The basic principles

24     I first looked at the basic principles for enhanced sentences under s 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act. These were set out by the district court in _PP v Mohamad Dom bin Matsaad_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGMC 11</span> (_“Dom”_) and summarized in _PP v Norfarah Binte Amir Hamzah_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 171</span> (_“Norfarah”_). In _Norfarah_ at \[31\], the court stated that:

> (a)     the determination of the enhanced sentence is a distinct and separate sentencing exercise from the sentence to be passed for the (breaching) offence;

> (b)     there are two decisions to be made in the enhanced sentencing exercise – whether an enhanced sentence is warranted and the length of the enhanced sentence, if it is warranted;

> (c)     the enhanced sentence is not a “fresh” sentence in that the court is not called upon to generate a sentence from scratch. Instead, the court is tasked to decide how much of the remaining suspended sentence ought to be “clawed back” and served in prison;

> (d)     the factors for making the two decisions at (b) are set out in s 50T(3) of the Prisons Act. These are the gravity of the Breaching Offence, the similarity of the Breaching Offence to the remission offence(s) and how long the person had remained crime-free after his release on remission. It is evident from these factors that the court has to be concerned with not only the Breaching Offence but also with the Remission Offence(s) for which the person was placed on conditional remission;

> (e)     the enhanced sentence is to be imposed and calibrated with the objectives of the Conditional Remission System (“CRS”) in mind. As spelt out in s 50E(1) of the Prisons Act, the purposes of the remission of sentences are to encourage good conduct and industry by prisoners who are serving their sentences and to facilitate the rehabilitation of prisoners and their reintegration into society. Bearing in mind the objectives of the CRS, the imposition of the enhanced sentence must serve the purposes for which a person was placed on remission and it must safeguard the integrity and not undermine the effective functioning of the CRS.

25     I agreed with these. These would be borne in mind when I considered the appropriate length of the enhanced sentence, if warranted, under s 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act.

#### Step 1: was the enhanced sentence under s 50T(1)(a) warranted?

26     The first step was to determine if the enhanced sentence under s 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act was warranted.

27     In _Dom_ at \[54\] – \[58\], the court discussed the interplay of the factors in s 50T(3)(a)-(d) of the Prisons Act to determine whether the imposition of the enhanced sentence was warranted. At \[70\]. The court summarised the following:

> (a)     Step 1: If the Breaching Offence is _not grave_ **and** _not similar_ to the Remission Offence or any of the Remission Offences if there were more than one, there was little reason to impose an enhanced sentence, unless the circumstances of the re-offending reveal a blatant disregard for the law or a total lack of interest to remain offence-free;

> (b)     Step 2: If the Breaching Offence was _grave_ **or** _similar_ to the Remission Offence or any of the Remission Offences if there were more than one, an enhanced sentence would be warranted.

28     Taking into consideration the objectives of CRS, there is no necessity at this stage, in my view, to dissect the Breaching Offence in fine detail in order to make a determination as to how _grave_ the Breaching Offence was or how _similar_ it was to the Remission Offence.

29     In the present case, the Breaching Offence was a subsequent offence of disorderly behaviour under s 20 of the MOA. The offence by itself is not a _grave_ offence _per se_. It should be noted that in determining whether or not the offence was grave, I did not consider the fact that the accused had five previous convictions for the same offence. Any uplift in this regard would have already been considered in determining the sentence for the Breaching Offence itself.

30     In terms of _similarity_, both the Remission Offence and the Breaching Offence are offences under the MOA. These are public order offences. There was thus cause to conclude that they were sufficiently similar to warrant the imposition of the enhanced sentence even without considering the third factor, namely that the accused has shown a blatant disregard for the law and a total lack of interest to remain offence-free by committing the Breaching Offence on the day he was released from prison.

#### Step 2: determining the appropriate enhanced sentence

31     Having determined that the enhanced sentence was warranted, the next step would be to determine the appropriate length of this sentence. In _Dom_ at \[59\] the court was of the view that the “_first step or starting point for the second stage should be the full period remaining of the remission order as at the date of the commission of the offence leading to the breach of the basic condition…._”.

32     I agreed with this approach. Under s 50K(1)(a) of the Prisons Act, when an accused has served two-thirds of his sentence, the remaining one-third is no longer remitted but is instead, _suspended_. The accused was _not_ granted an unconditional early release from prison. He was released conditionally, and this required him not to re-offend during the period of remission. By committing the Breaching Offence, he had violated the _basic_ condition of his remission. Therefore, it was only appropriate that the starting point should be the entire period of the remission order.

33     In the present case, the starting position in determining the length of the enhanced sentence would be the entire period of 363 days.

34     The second step in the second stage required the assessment of the factors set out in s 50T(3)(a) – (d) of the Prisons Act.

> (a)      Gravity of the offence _viz_ s 50T(3)(a).

> The Breaching Offence is one of disorderly behaviour under s 20 of the MOA. Whether an offence is grave (or not) may, in most cases, be determined by the punishment prescribed by law. However, there may be times when there is a ned to look into the particulars of the charge to determine this. For example, an offence of criminal intimidation under the first limb of s 506 of the PC may or may not be considered grave depending on the factual matrix.

> However, in this case, the offence of disorderly behaviour is clearly not a grave offence irrespective of the metrics that is used to determine this. It is also not as grave as the Remission Offence of making harassing or obscene phone calls to emergency numbers under s 14A(3)(a) of the MOA. The punishment prescribed by law for the Breaching Offence is half that of the Remission Offence. An offence under s 14A(3)(a) of the MOA carries with it an imprisonment term of up to two years’ imprisonment or to a fine of up to $10,000 or to both, whilst one under s 20 of the MOA which carries an imprisonment term of up to 12 months or a fine of up to $5,000 or to both for a second or subsequent offender. As such, I adjudged that the enhanced sentence should be calibrated down from the full remission period.

> (b)      Similarity between the Breaching Offence and the Remission Offence _viz_ s 50T(3)(b)

> The similarity between the Breaching and Remission Offences can be considered in terms of specificity (for example, the ingredients of the offence) or generality (for example, the class or type of offence). In my view, the greater the similarity, a longer enhanced sentence should be considered. For example, if the Remission Offence had been an enhanced consumption charge with the Breaching Offence being an LT1 drug consumption charge, then an enhanced sentence of the full period of remission should be considered.

> In the present case, although there was no specific similarity between the Remission and the Breaching Offence, there is some general similarity, namely that both offences could be classified as public order offences. As such, I was of the view that the enhanced sentence should be further calibrated downwards,

> (c)      Length of time before the accused committed an offence, _viz_ s 50T(3)(c)

> It appears logical in principle that, the sooner an accused breaches the basic condition after his conditional release by committing another offence, the more there is a need to impose a longer enhanced sentence. However, this has, in effect, already been worked into the CRS regime. As noted by the court in _Dom_ at \[36\] , “_….. the earlier the person re-offends after release from prison, the length of time available to be imposed will be longer. Conversely, no matter how grave or how similar the Breaching Offence might be to the Remission Offences, if the offence was committed with one week remaining before the end of the remission period, the maximum enhanced sentence can only amount to one week._”

> Therefore, despite the fact that the accused committed the Breaching Offence within a day of his release, there was still a need to consider this factor against the backdrop of the other factors in s 50T(3)(a), (b) and (d). In the present case, the accused’s culpability would be considered as high, and therefore, the length of the enhanced sentence to be imposed would correspondingly still be more significant as a percentage of the maximum enhanced sentence but this should still looked at in light of the _similarity_ and _gravity_ of the Breaching Offence _viz_ the Remission Offence.

> (d)      All other relevant circumstances _viz_ s 50T(3)(d).

> In my assessment, there were no other relevant factors to consider in the present case.

35     Having assessed the factors set out in s 50T(3)(a) – (d) of the Prisons Act, I next had to make a determination what was the appropriate enhanced sentence that should be imposed on the accused.

36     I did not think that the full period of the remission order, namely 363 days’ imprisonment should be imposed. The Breaching Offence, though in general, similar to the Remission Offence, was not a grave offence. Hence, I assessed the appropriate enhanced sentence at this point to be slightly less than 20% of the maximum enhanced sentence. However, the accused had committed the Breaching Offence on the same day that he was released. As mentioned, this by itself would warrant a significant “clawback” despite the Breaching Offence not being grave. I accordingly adjusted this upward by an additional third of the maximum enhanced sentence, taking into account the _similarity_ and _gravity_ of the Breaching Offence _viz_ the Remission Offence

37     All considered, I therefore adjudged that the appropriate enhanced sentence to be imposed on the accused should be in the region of 50% of the maximum remission period of 363 days and rounded it down slightly. As highlighted above, a greater part of this assessment was attributed to _when_ the accused had committed the Breaching Offence. As such, I imposed an enhanced sentence of 180 days on the accused for the breach of the basic condition under s 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act.

## Conclusion

38     In conclusion, I sentenced the accused to:

> (a)     Eight months’ imprisonment for his sixth conviction for disorderly behaviour under s 20 of the MOA; and

> (b)     an enhanced sentence of 180 days’ imprisonment for breaching the basic condition of his remission order under section 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act.

39     Pursuant to s 50T(5), I ordered that the enhanced sentence of 180 days’ imprisonment was to run after the sentence imposed for the offence under s 20 of the MOA. I further ordered that the sentence was to commence with effect from 21 September 2020, the date the accused was first remanded into custody.

40     The accused, being dissatisfied with the sentence I have imposed, has appealed against it. He is presently serving sentence.
