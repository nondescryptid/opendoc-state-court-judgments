Civil Procedure – Judgments and orders – Enforcement – Application for leave to issue writ of execution where more than six years have lapsed since the date of the judgment

16 June 2021

### Deputy Registrar Liu Zeming:

1       A judgment creditor _cannot_ issue a writ of execution to enforce a judgment _without the leave of the court_ where more than six years have lapsed since the date of the judgment. The six-year execution period is often overlooked and can have important consequences – as it did in this case.

## Background to the Application

2       The Plaintiff is a co-operative and has, on 8 July 2013, obtained a judgment against the Defendant in default of appearance (the “**2013 Judgment**”). The 2013 Judgment ordered the Defendant to pay the following to the Plaintiff:

> (a)     a sum of $5,608.75;

> (b)     interest of $1,351.00;

> (c)     contractual interest on the sum of $5,608.75 at 6% per annum from the date of the writ until date of full payment; and

> (d)     costs of $1,300.00 and disbursements of $592.64.

> (collectively, the “**Judgment Sum**”)

3       No formal step was taken by the Plaintiff to enforce the 2013 Judgment until 11 October 2020, when the Plaintiff attempted to file a writ of seizure and sale (the “**WSS**”). The filing of the WSS was rejected as more than six years had lapsed since the 2013 Judgment and leave of court to file the WSS had not been obtained.[^1]

4       On 17 March 2021, the Plaintiff filed Summons No. 1339/2021 (the “**Application**”) for leave to issue a writ of execution under O 46 r 2(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“**ROC**”).

5       The Application was made _ex-parte_ and first came before me for an asynchronous hearing on 18 March 2021. As I was not satisfied with the explanations for the delay provided by the Plaintiff in its affidavit in support of the Application, I gave directions for the Plaintiff to file a supplementary affidavit and brief written submissions to address my concerns, as well as to raise any other matters which the Plaintiff intended to rely on for the Application. The supplementary affidavit and written submissions were duly filed on 6 April 2021.

6       Having considered the factual matters and legal arguments raised, I dismissed the application on 14 April 2021. These are the grounds of my decision.

## The Law

7       Under O 46 r 2(1)(a) of the ROC, a writ of execution to enforce a judgment or order may not be issued without leave of court where six years or more have lapsed since the date of the judgment or order. A “_writ of execution_” includes a writ of seizure and sale, a writ of possession and a writ of delivery: see O 46 r 1 of the ROC.

8       It is settled practice that leave to extend time beyond the six-year period to issue a writ of execution would not be granted unless it is “_demonstrably just to do so_”: see _AmBank (M) Bhd v Yong Kim Yoong Raymond_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 2 SLR(R) 659</span> (“**_AmBank_**”) at \[43\]. Generally speaking, the lapse of six years may, and will ordinarily, in itself justify refusing the judgment creditor leave to issue the writ of execution, unless the judgment creditor can justify the granting of leave by showing that the circumstances of his or her case takes it out of the ordinary: see _AmBank_ at \[44\] and \[45\]. Each case turns on its own facts, but the onus of proving that it is just to grant leave lies on the judgment creditor: see _AmBank_ at \[46\] and \[47\].

## The Facts

9       In this case, the Plaintiff obtained the 2013 Judgment on 8 July 2013. As far as it appears from the court’s record, no step was taken to issue execution on the 2013 Judgment until the unsuccessful attempt to file the WSS in October 2020 -- more than _seven years_ since the entry of the 2013 Judgment. Thereafter, there was yet another hiatus of around five months, before the present Application was filed on 17 March 2021. No reason was given to explain why the Plaintiff took more than 5 months to make this Application. In any event, by the time the Application was filed, _close to eight years_ had passed since the entry of the 2013 Judgment.

10     The question which begs to be answered, therefore, is what happened in the interim eight years?

11     The Plaintiff initially provided several reasons to explain why execution was not issued in the initial six-year period, namely that:

> (a)     the Defendant had promised to make monthly installments of $300 towards the debt, but failed to do so;[^2]

> (b)     the Plaintiff then referred the matter to its debt collectors, who were not successful in recovering the debt;[^3]

> (c)     the Plaintiff, being a Co-operative, was “_at first hesitant to proceed with a Writ of Seizure and Sale as the place of execution belongs to the debtor’s parents_”;[^4]

> (d)     the Plaintiff was “_unable to proceed with Bankruptcy Proceedings as the debt was less than $10,000. Subsequently when the amount amounted to more than $10,000.00 due to the recurring interest, the threshold sum to proceed with Bankruptcy Proceedings had increased to $15,000.00_”;[^5]

> (e)     the Plaintiff was unable to contact the Defendant on her handphone;[^6]

> (f)     the Defendant did not respond to “_several letters_” sent by the Plaintiff;[^7] and

> (g)     the Defendant blocked the Plaintiff on Facebook.[^8]

12     As the initial chronology of events provided by the Plaintiff was lacking in particulars, I requested that the Plaintiff file a supplementary affidavit to explain the steps taken to recover on the 2013 Judgment in further detail. On 6 April 2021, the Plaintiff filed a supplementary affidavit (“**2nd Affidavit**”). I set out below the chronology of events as it appears from the 1st and 2nd Affidavits:

> (1)      _Pre-2013 Judgment – 2011 to 2013_

>> (a)       The Plaintiff sent a letter of demand to the Defendant on 1 June 2009 and the Defendant promised to make monthly installment payments towards the loan, but failed to do so.[^9]

>> (b)       The matter was then referred to debtor collectors in or around 2011, but no payment was recovered by the debt collectors.[^10]

>> (c)       A letter of demand was issued to the Defendant on 2 August 2011 but there was no reply.[^11]

> (2)      _Post-2013 Judgment – Between 2013 and 2014_

>> (d)       The 2013 Judgment was sent to the Defendant on 11 July 2013, 17 April 2014 and 30 October 2014, but no response was received.[^12]

>> (e)       On 11 October 2013, the Plaintiff’s solicitors were able to contact the Defendant on her mobile phone, and the Defendant promised to make installment payments of $300 per month. However, the payment was never made.[^13]

>> (f)       Further attempts to contact the Defendant on her mobile phone were unsuccessful.[^14]

>> (g)       In February 2014, the matter was referred to a different set of debt collectors, but no payment was recovered.[^15]

>> (h)       In March 2014, the Plaintiff managed to locate the Defendant and her new address, and a copy of the 2013 Judgment was sent to the new address.[^16]

>> (i)       In April 2014, the Plaintiff became aware through the Defendant’s Facebook posts that she was employed and had made overseas trips. However, the Plaintiff was unable to contact the Defendant through Facebook.[^17]

>> (j)       On 19 November 2014, the Defendant made an appointment with the Plaintiff to make a payment of $300.00, but she did not turn up. The meeting was re-scheduled, but the Defendant was absent at the re-scheduled meeting as well.[^18]

> (3)      _Post-2013 Judgment – From 2017 to 2021_

>> (k)       On 12 September 2017, the Plaintiff sent the Defendant a further letter stating that the Plaintiff will proceed with a writ of seizure and sale if the Defendant did not revert. No response was received from the Defendant.[^19]

>> (l)       The Plaintiff was initially reluctant to proceed with a writ of seizure and sale because “_the flat was owned by the Defendant’s parents_”. However, it now wishes to do so.[^20]

## Application of the Law to the Facts

13     In my view, it is clear from the chronology of events above that this is not a case where it is “_demonstrably just_” to grant leave for the Plaintiff to issue writ of execution after six years. If there is anything which takes this case “_out of the ordinary_”, it is the extraordinary lack of effort on the part of the Plaintiff in taking steps to enforce the 2013 Judgment. I set out below some of the main reasons which have led me to this conclusion.

14     First, apart from the initial steps taken by the Plaintiff in 2013 and 2014 to recover on the 2013 Judgment, there appears to have been _total inaction_ in the period between 2015 to late 2017 (when a letter of demand was issued), and then from early 2018 to late 2020 (when the Plaintiff attempted to file the WSS). The Plaintiff did not attempt to explain the delay between 2015 and 2020, save to say that it is a “_co-operative_” and was “_at first hesitant to proceed with a Writ of Seizure and Sale as the place of execution belongs to the debtor’s parent_”.[^21]

15     It is unclear to me why the Plaintiff being a co-operative would hinder it in the execution or enforcement of the 2013 Judgment or justify the long delay. The Plaintiff asserts that leave should be granted because the Plaintiff is “_a co-operative and_ \[is\] _accountable to_ \[its\] _members for the members_ \[sic\] _monies_”[^22], but would this not make the delay more inexcusable? In any event, it appears that there was in fact no impediment to the Plaintiff levying execution against the property belonging to the Defendant’s parents, because that was precisely what the Plaintiff was seeking to do, should leave to issue a writ of execution be granted. I am therefore unable to see how the fact that the Plaintiff is a “_co-operative_” satisfactorily justifies the inaction between 2015 and 2020 (save for one letter of demand issued in 2017).

16     The Plaintiff’s inaction was even more inexplicable given that the Plaintiff was aware, since March 2014, that the Defendant was gainfully employed and had made several overseas trips, which suggested that the Defendant had assets against which execution could be levied. This was not a case where the initial inaction could be excused on the basis that the Plaintiff had genuinely believed that the Defendant had no assets, and was therefore not worth the “_powder and shot_” of enforcement: see _Dipika Patel v Sarbjit Singh_ \[2002\] EWCA Civ 1938 (“**_Patel_**”) at \[21\]. Neither was this a situation where the Plaintiff was in constant settlement discussions with the Defendant and was misled by partial payments made by the Defendant: see _Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd v Salim bin Said and other matters_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHCR 7</span> at \[27\].

17     To be clear, I do not suggest that Plaintiff must fit its case into one of the established “_categories_” before leave can be granted. There are no such “_categories_” and whether leave should be granted would depend on the facts of each case. However, the Plaintiff bears the burden of providing _cogent reasons_ to justify its failure to enforce the 2013 Judgment within the usual time, and I was not satisfied that the Plaintiff had discharge its burden in this case.

18     Second, even for the “_enforcement_” steps taken between 2013 and 2014, it appeared that the Plaintiff went no further than issuing letters of demand, and engaging debt collectors. The Plaintiff had suggested that it was initially reluctant to proceed with a writ of seizure and sale, because the property was owned by the Defendant’s aged parents (which remains the case at the time of the attempted filing of the WSS). I have dealt with this explanation above (at \[15\]) but even assuming this to be acceptable, it could not explain why _other_ methods of execution could not be attempted, or why a writ of seizure and sale could not be issued at the Defendant's new address which the Plaintiff obtained in March 2014. There was also no explanation why the Plaintiff could not have obtained more information on the Defendant’s assets by procuring an order for examination of the judgment debtor.

19     In fact, it appeared that the Plaintiff’s representative had indicated to its solicitors in as early as November 2013 and March 2014 that this was a “_priority_” case[^23] and that the Plaintiff wished to proceed with the “_next course of action_”.[^24] Garnishee proceedings was also contemplated in early 2014[^25] but, for reasons unexplained, was not proceeded with.

20     Third, the Plaintiff’s explanation that it was unable to commence bankruptcy proceedings against the Defendant because of the change in the statutory threshold also appeared to be inaccurate.

21     The 2013 Judgment was for the principal sum of $5,608.75, interest of $1,351 and costs of $1,300 and disbursement of $592.64, with contractual interest running at 6% per annum on the sum of principal $5,608.75, from the date of the writ (i.e. 12 January 2013) to the date of full payment. The Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20) (Rev Ed 2009) was amended on 1 August 2016 to increase the statutory threshold for personal bankruptcy applications from $10,000.00 to $15,000.00. As at July 2016 (i.e. prior to the amendment to the Bankruptcy Act), the total amount due under the 2013 Judgment would have been approximately $10,238 and would have exceed the threshold amount of $10,000.

22     Of course, the Plaintiff is not expected to watch the clock and file a bankruptcy application the moment the judgment debt crossed the statutory threshold. But the point is that the Plaintiff is now seeking to rely on the purported inability to do so to explain its inaction and, for the reason mentioned, I could not accept this as a satisfactory explanation.

23     The totality of the evidence suggested to me that while there were some initial efforts to recover on the 2013 Judgment between 2013 and 2014, there was extensive delay and largely inaction between 2015 and 2020, which has not been explained adequately, or at all, in this Application.

24     Lastly, and for completeness, I deal with the Plaintiff’s submission that the Defendant “_had the means to travel…after taking the loan_”, is “_gainfully employed_”, is able to _“_\[dine\] _in restaurants and_ \[watch\] _movies regularly_” and has benefitted from being able to “_evade_” payment to the Plaintiff despite having the ability to do so.[^26] The Plaintiff submitted that the “_Defendant should not take advantage of the monies as the monies belong to the Co-operative_”.[^27]

25     The Plaintiff’s submission perhaps echoed a sentiment felt by many others in similar position, and I can appreciate the indignation behind it. Such indignation is, however, in my view misplaced.

26     Quite apart from the fact that the circumstances outlined by the Plaintiff begged the question why the Plaintiff did not levy execution if it believed that the Defendant was a person of means, it is important to be clear that the decision not to grant leave was _not_ intended as an affirmation of the judgment debtor’s conduct in failing to make payment on a valid judgment debt. Rather, it was in recognition of the fact that the _judgment creditor_ had the opportunity to make full use of the court’s machineries and processes to enforce its judgment, but did not do so, and without satisfactory explanation, for an extensive period. To borrow the words of Peter Gibson LJ in _Patel_, a judgment creditor “_has to get on with enforcing his judgment_”, and it is this policy consideration which underlies O 46 r 2(1): see _Patel_ at \[19\] and \[21\]. If the outcome of denying leave to a judgment creditor had the effect of “_benefitting_” the judgment debtor (and it should not be viewed as such), then the judgment creditor must recognise that it is a benefit which only the judgment creditor could, by its own conduct, have bestowed.

## Conclusion

27     To be clear, the Plaintiff still has a valid judgment, and the Defendant is still indebted to the Plaintiff on the 2013 Judgment. The fact that writs of execution cannot be issued does not mean that the judgment debt is extinguished, and it clearly has not. The consequence of the decision in this Application is that the Plaintiff would be unable to issue writs of execution on the 2013 Judgment unless fresh leave is granted. As noted in _AmBank_, the dismissal of an application for leave does not preclude the making of a fresh application, although any later application must be founded on new material if it is to succeed: see _AmBank_ at \[14\].

28     For the reasons above, the Application is dismissed. Since this was an _ex-parte_ application and I did not require the attendance of the Defendant, no order is made as to costs for this application.
