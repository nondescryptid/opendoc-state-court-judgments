Criminal Procedure And Sentencing – Sentencing – Remote Gambling Act 2014 (Act 34 of 2014) – Application of sentencing framework

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9081/2021/01-02.\]

30 July 2021

### District Judge Adam Nakhoda:

## Introduction

1       The Accused, the co-Accused, Mr Dominic Tay Chun Long (“Mr Tay”) and Mr Wong Wei Quan (“Mr Wong”) (collectively “the co-accused”), had provided a Singapore-based remote gambling service by organising online poker games. The co-accused had utilised an existing online poker application, invited players, and organised online poker games. Over a period of approximately three months the players placed a total of not less than $2,166,741.20 in bets.

2       The Accused pleaded guilty to a charge of providing a Singapore-based remote gambling service under s 11(1) of the Remote Gambling Act 2014 (No. 34 of 2014) (“RGA”). I sentenced the Accused to 20 months’ imprisonment. The primary issue in this case was whether I had correctly applied the sentencing framework for offences under s 11 RGA laid down in _Koo Kah Yee v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 3 SLR 1440</span>. The Accused and the Prosecution being dissatisfied with the sentence have appealed. The Accused is currently on bail pending the hearing of the appeal.

## Charges

3       The details of the charge are as follows:

> **MAC 908894 of 2019**

> are charged that you, from 23 September 2017 to 5 January 2018, in Singapore, did provide a Singapore-based remote gambling service by:

>> (a)    organizing remote gambling by others by inviting players to gamble in the “Stealthpoker” club on the “PPPoker” application, and procuring agents who would source for more players;

>> (b)    providing facilities for remote gambling by others by accepting players’ requests to join “Stealthpoker” on “PPPoker”, thereby allowing them to gamble by placing bets at any of the virtual poker tables in operation;

>> (c)    facilitated participation by others in remote gambling by issuing chips to your agents and players in return for money, and creating virtual tables for players to play variants of poker, allowing them to place a total of not less than $2,166,741.20 in bets;

>> (d)    managed remote gambling by others by keeping tracking of your players’ bets, _to wit_, by receiving weekly PPPoker reports from one Dominic Tay Chun Long (“Dominic”), calculating the final profit or loss incurred by each individual player, and using this report as the basis for that week’s settlement of monies; and

>> (e)    distributed money or money’s worth paid or staked by others by settling monies with your agents, players, Dominic, and one Wong Wei Quan;

> and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 11(1) of the Remote Gambling Act 2014 (No. 34 of 2014).

## Facts

### PPPoker application

4       PPPoker is an application-as-a-service (“the App”) developed by AceKing Tech Limited (“AceKing”) and was available on Android, iOS and Windows. Anyone could use the App to host or play in private or public games of poker.

5       To join a private game a player had to download the App and then join a specific club by entering its “Club ID” when prompted. If the player was approved by the club host, the player would then be able to play at a table that the host has opened. The player would obtain chips from the host to play. The App did not require the player to pay the host for chips.

6       The App could also be used by a host to provide a remote gambling service to his players. To host a private game, the host would create an account on the App, then create a club by specifying a unique “Club ID”. The host could publicise the club to attract players and would then have to approve requests by players to join the club. If an application to join the club was approved by the host, the new players be able to play at the club’s table(s).

7       A host would be able to issue his players with chips, however, to do so the host would have to purchase “diamonds” from AceKing and convert these into chips. The diamonds could be purchased via in-app purchases. Alternatively, if the host and AceKing agreed to do so, payment could be made to AceKing via non-app means in return for AceKing crediting diamonds into the host’s account. The host could also spend diamonds to “upgrade” the club allowing him to host more players. A non-upgraded club could host a maximum of 30 players. The host would also have to spend diamonds each month to renew the club.

8       At the material time:

> (a)     6,000 diamonds cost US$99 (approximately S$167);

> (b)     A diamond could be converted into 3 chips; and

> (c)     The monthly renewal fee was between 10,000 to 15,000 diamonds.

9       The “rake” referred to the amount earned by the club host. PPPoker automatically calculated the rake attributable to the host. The rake would not be collected on games determined by PPPoker to be too short and, if collected, it would be 5% of the players’ winnings per game.

### The co-accused’s involvement

10     The Accused and Mr Tay started playing poker games using the App in 2017. They got to know each other and started communicating via WhatsApp. Eventually, they decided to jointly host a poker club on the App as a business venture. They named the club “Stealthpoker” (“the club”). Mr Tay invited Mr Wong to join the venture.

11     The club operated from on or before 23 September 2017 till 5 January 2018, a period of 15 weeks. The co-accused designated each week of operation as a “season”. In all, there were 15 seasons.

12     The co-accused, who were in Singapore at all material times, served as the central management and control of the remote gambling service. The remote gambling service that they operated was therefore Singapore-based. The co-accused organised remote gambling by inviting their players to gamble in the club. They procured agents who would source for players. The agents provides the co-accused with the in-game nicknames of new players.

13     The co-accused provided facilities for remote gambling by the players others by accepting players’ requests to join the club on the App. In doing so, they allowed their players to gamble by placing bets at any of the virtual poker tables in operation at their club. Therefore, they made facilities for remote communication available for use, being facilities which were presented and intended to be used wholly for gambling.

14     The co-accused facilitated participation by others in remote gambling as follows:

> (a)     Mr Tay purchased diamonds three to five times a week, converting these to chips, and issuing these chips to the Accused and Mr Wong.

> (b)     The co-accused issued these chips to their agents and players in return for money. The chips were often issued on credit terms. From 23 September 2017 to 17 November 2017 (_i.e._, Seasons 1-8), 1 chip cost S$0.25. From 18 November 2017 to 5 January 2018 (_i.e._, Seasons 9-15), 1 chip cost S$1.00.

> (c)     The co-accused created virtual tables for players to play variants of poker.

> (d)     As the club grew, Mr Tay purchased diamonds to “upgrade” the club, allowing more players to join it and participate in remote gambling. Mr Tay also paid around 15,000 diamonds per month to “renew” the club.

15     The co-accused managed remote gambling by others by keeping track of their players’ bets:

> (a)     Every week, Mr Tay would generate an App report summarising the tables that were opened and games that were played that week.

> (b)     From 30 Sep 2017 (_i.e._, Season 2), Mr Tay sent these reports to the Accused to “tidy up” and send back to him. The Accused would calculate the final profit or loss incurred by each individual player. This would form the basis for that week’s settlement of monies.

> (c)     On one or two occasions, Mr Wong performed the calculations.

16     The co-accused distributed money or money’s worth, paid or staked by others by settling monies among themselves and their agents every Saturday, Sunday, or Monday. These settlements were sometimes in-person.

> (a)     The co-accused would take 30% of the global rake, with the remaining 70% going to the agents.

> (b)     The Accused used his POSB bank account to receive money from the players and send money to the agents, players, Mr Tay, and Mr Wong. Occasionally, Mr Tay would log into the Accused’s iBanking account and perform transfers himself.

> (c)     Mr Wong preferred to physically meet his players in order to pass them money or collect money from them.

17     At the peak of the club’s activity (i.e. in Season 9):

> (a)     The Accused had at least 7 agents and 51 unique accounts (which may have belonged to 51 or less unique individuals) under him;

> (b)     Mr Tay had at least 6 agents (including Alvin) and 50 players (including Alvin and Alvin’s players) under him; and

> (c)     Mr Wong had at least 3 players under him.

### Mr Wong’s downgrading

18     On 21 October 2017 (season 5), Mr Wong was downgraded to an agent as the Accused and Mr Tay felt that Alvin had not brought in enough players, and, as such, he should not share in the 30% rake attributable to the hosts. During this time Mr Wong earned 70% of the rake generated by the players under him. Mr Wong worked hard to re-join the partnership by bringing in more players and, on 25 November 2017 (_i.e._, Season 10), Mr Wong was promoted back to a host of the remote gambling service.

### The bets placed

19     The total bets placed are summarised in the table below. It should be noted that one player could have used more than one account and, as such, the number of unique accounts may not reflect the number of unique players:

20     The total bet value for the s 11 RGA offences involving the Accused and Mr Tay was at least $2,166,741.20. The total bet value for the s 11 offence involving Mr Wong was at least $1,081,676.20 (this excluded the period when Mr Wong was downgraded).

21     The extent of the club’s activity was such that after about two months, a representative from AceKing messaged Mr Tay and arranged to meet. The representative informed Mr Tay that he could purchase diamonds by directly making bank transfers to her, this would be cheaper as it avoided Apple’s 30% tax on all in-app purchases. Mr Tay agreed to the proposal.

22     In January 2018, Mr Tay chose not to renew the club membership and the club was terminated on 5 January 2018.

23     On 24 February 2021, Mr Wong was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment for an offence under s 11 RGA. Mr Tay’s case had not been dealt with.

## Charges taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing

24     The Accused admitted to and consented for one charge under s 8(1) RGA, of gambling using remote communication being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing (“TIC charge”).

## Issues to be determined

25     The issues to be determined in this case are as follows:

> (a)     Was the sentencing framework for s 11 RGA offences laid down in _Koo Kah Yee_ correctly applied in the present case?

> (b)     Did the principle of parity of sentencing apply in that the Accused should be sentenced to the same sentence imposed on Mr Wong, i.e. 12 months’ imprisonment.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed Penalties

26     The s 11 RGA offence is punishable, with a fine of not less than $20,000 and not more than $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years or to both.

### Antecedents

27     The Accused had no antecedents.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

28     The Prosecution submitted that general deterrence was the predominant sentencing consideration. During the Second Reading of the Remote Gambling Bill, it was highlighted that “the nature and design of certain games that are offered remotely \[lend\] themselves to repetitive play and addictive behaviour”, and “remote gambling is ubiquitous and easily accessible, largely due to the growing reach of the Internet, readily available and affordable mobile bandwidth, and the proliferation of smart devices.”

29     The Prosecution submitted that these concern were clear in the present case and that the ease at which bets in excess of $2 million were raked up by the use of the App necessitated a deterrent response.

30     The Prosecution submitted that the court was bound to apply the sentencing framework in _Koo Kah Yee._ At Step 1, the Prosecution submitted that the harm caused was at least moderate and that the first and fourth of the non-exhaustive harm factors were engaged, namely:

> (a)     The aggregate value of bets involved was high. The remote gambling service generated not less than S$2,166,741.20 in bets over a period of 105 days. The bets were placed on not less than 833 virtual tables and involved not less than 127,508 hands being played by 293 unique accounts. Based on the significant sum involved and likely significant number of players involved, it was reasonable to categorize the harm as medium.

> (b)     The offence was difficult to detect. The bets were placed via the App and, where possible, the Accused used bank transfers to settle monies with his agents and players. The Prosecution submitted that the accused’s bank account was explicitly used with a view to avoid detection (as compared to physically settling monies).

31     With regard to the level of culpability, the Prosecution submitted that all the non-exhaustive factors affecting culpability, except the fourth factor, personal gain, were engaged:

> (a)     The activity involved planning and premeditation as the co-accused had agreed beforehand to host the poker club as a business venture and they had set defined roles.

> (b)     There was a level of sophistication as the Accused had used his POSB bank account to receive money and send money. This enabled the Accused to avoid the risk of transacting personally in public places. The co-accused had displayed enterprise in taking the active step of converting the in-game currency (chips) to Singaporean currency and that they eventually liaised directly with the app developer to obtain chips at a favourable rate.

> (c)     The Accused had invited players to join the club, procured agents to source for new players, issued chips to his agents and players, created virtual tables, and performed the overall profit/loss calculations for around 13 seasons. The Prosecution submitted that the Accused was also the most successful “recruiter” among the accused persons as he had more agents and players under him compared to Mr Tay and Mr Wong.

> (d)     The criminal activity was conducted over 105 days, which was a substantial period of time. It was not a one-off enterprise.

32     The Prosecution submitted that the culpability should be pegged at high.

33     Based on moderate harm and high culpability the appropriate sentencing range was two and a half years to four years’ imprisonment. The Prosecution submitted that a fine was not warranted as there was no evidence of profits to be disgorged. The Prosecution submitted that the starting point should be 39 months’ imprisonment. The Prosecution submitted that the TIC’ed s 8 RGA was an aggravating factor and that the fact that the Accused had pleaded guilty at an early stage, his cooperation with the authorities and his relatively young age warranted a reduction in the sentence. The Prosecution urged the court to impose a sentence of 26 months’ imprisonment.

34     The Prosecution submitted that it was absurd to treat the Accused’s culpability and Mr Wong’s culpability as being equal and, as such, the principle of parity of sentencing between the two was not applicable.

### Mitigation

35     Applying the _Koh Kah Yee_ framework the Defence submitted that the level of harm was between slight to moderate. The Defence argued that the number of unique accounts that placed bets during any one season did not necessarily reflect the actual number of players who were betting, this was because a player may have had multiple accounts. The Defence argued that placing reliance on the number of accounts ran the risk of double counting the number of players.

36     The Defence submitted whether the bet value of $2,166,741.20 gave an indication of the size of the operation but that due care had to be taken in not double penalising the Accused by giving weight to both the bet value and the total number of players. The Defence also submitted that considering a bet value of over $2 million to be large was arbitrary in view of the limited number of cases involving offences under s 11 RGA. It was submitted that precedents from offences under the Common Gaming Houses Act and the Betting Act should not be relied upon.

37     The Defence submitted that little weight ought to be given to the Prosecution’s position that the offence was difficult to detect by virtue that the bets were placed via the App and that the Accused had used bank transfers where possible to evade detection. The Defence submitted, in fact, bank transactions would ease detection.

38     With regard to culpability, the Defence submitted that there was no high degree of planning and premeditation, and in fact it was a simple operation. The Defence contrasted this to the sophistication of the scheme in _Koo Kah Yee_ where the main perpetrators had incorporated shell companies and created various websites to carry out their scheme. By contrast the App was readily available for download from iTunes and Google playstore. The Defence argued that the Accused using his own POSBank account to facilitate money transfers was not indicative of sophistication, rather it demonstrated that there was little effort taken to conceal his activities.

39     The Defence submitted that that the Accused had not met the representative of AceKing, rather it was Mr Tay who met her. The Defence accepted that the scheme persisted for 105 days, however, it was submitted that the operation terminated voluntarily, i.e. before police investigations. The Defence submitted that Mr Tay was more culpable than the Accused because Mr Tay had invited Mr Wong to join the group, Mr Tay had purchased the in-game currency, Mr Tay had generated the relevant reports from the App and he had liaised with the AceKing’s representative.

40     The Defence submitted that the Accused’s culpability was in the moderate band. Based on slight harm and moderate culpability, the Defence submitted that the sentencing range should be up to one years’ imprisonment. It was submitted that there were no aggravating factors especially as the value of the bet that the Accused placed with regard to the TIC charge had already been included in the value of the bets placed with regard to the s 11 RGA charge.

41     Conversely, the Defence submitted that the Accused was a first-time offender and that he was very remorseful as evidenced by his early plea of guilt. The Defence highlighted that the Accused was very cooperative with the investigations and he had readily provided the police with the necessary user-ids and passwords to access his iPhone and email. The Defence also argued that credit had to be given to the Accused for terminating the operation before police investigations.

42     The Defence submitted that the court should take into account the Accused’s relative youth at the time he committed the offence and that the Accused was not a hardened criminal, rather he was a foolish youth who knew no better. The Defence tendered testimonials to the Accused’s good character and his ability to contribute to society. The Defence sought a sentence of not more than 12 months’ imprisonment.

43     The Defence submitted that as the Accused’s culpability was the same as Mr Wong’s the principle of parity of sentencing had to apply and the Accused should not be sentenced to more than 12 months’ imprisonment.

44     The Defence referred to _Elger Kua_, submitting that the offence in that case was far more egregious, as there were 296 unique players, that the period of offending was longer and that the offender only stopped his activities when he was arrested. Therefore, the sentence to be imposed on the Accused should not be more severe than the offender’s sentence in _Elger Kua._

45     The Defence also submitted that the circumstances in _Koo Kah Yee_ were far more aggravated.

### Decision on Sentence

#### Relevant legislative provisions

46     The relevant provision of the RGA is as follows:

> **11.** – (1)    A person who provides a Singapore-based remote gambling service shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of not less than $20,000 and not more than $500,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years or to both.

#### Was the sentencing framework for s 11 RGA offences laid down in Koo Kah Yee correctly applied in the present case?

##### (1)   Parliamentary intention

47     In _Koo Kah Yee_, Sundaresh Menon CJ examined the legislative intention behind he RGA and noted s 7 of the RGA, which states:

> **Purpose of Act**

> **7**.    The purpose of this Act is to regulate remote gambling and remote gambling services affecting Singapore with the object of –

>> (a)    preventing remote gambling from being a source of crime or disorder, being associated with crime or disorder or being used to support crime or disorder; and

>> (b)    protecting young person and other vulnerable persons from being harmed or exploited by remote gambling.

48     Menon CJ held that the problem of remote gambling was considered to be especially pernicious for three reasons: (1) because remote gambling operators were typically associated with other criminal activities and syndicated crime, which also operated on a transnational scale; (2) the nature and design of the games lent themselves to repetitive play and addictive behaviour; and (3) remote gambling was ubiquitous and easily accessible in view of the reach of the internet and use of mobile devices: see _Koo Kah Yee_ at \[30\]. It was clear that the predominant sentencing consideration for an offence under s 11 of the RGA was general deterrence.

##### (2)   Sentencing framework

49     Menon CJ held that the relevant sentencing considerations for a s 11 offence were divided into offence-specific and offender-specific factors. With regard to the offence-specific factors the court had to consider the (1) degree of harm caused by the offence; and (2) the offender’s culpability. CJ Menon provided a non-exhaustive list of offence specific factors, see _Koo Kah Yee_ at \[55\]:

50     Menon CJ held that the amount of bets involved was an important factor in the court’s assessment of harm as the value of bets gave an indication as to the size of the illegal operations and that, generally, the larger the bets collected or transacted, the greater the harm: see _Koo Kah Yee_ at \[57\]. The difficulty in detecting the offence was also a relevant consideration in view of how gambling activities offered on remote or online platforms tended to further anonymise the operators and players making detection all the more difficult: see _Koo Kah Yee_ at \[60\].

51     With regard to the factors affecting culpability, CJ Menon stated that the use of the internet would generally increase the culpability associated with an offence because it acted as a powerful multiplier that would extend the reach of gambling activities, and in the context of a s 11 RGA offence the level of sophistication would entail a consideration of the nature of the remote communications used, the _modus operandi_ of the remote gambling ring and the scale of the operations: see _Koo Kah Yee_ at \[62\].

52     With regard to the offender’s role, CJ Menon held that offenders who were essentially runners carrying out the instruction of their controllers would be less culpable to the masterminds behind the criminal operations. It would be an aggravating factor if the offender has recruited others as accomplices into the criminal operation. Finally, offending over a longer period would be more culpable than a one-off offence: see _Koo Kah Yee_ at \[63 & 65\].

53     The offender-specific factors included:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="50.58%"> <col width="49.42%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="b" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Offender-specific factors (non-exhaustive)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><u>Aggravating factors</u></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1.

54     Menon CJ held that after ascertaining the levels of harm and culpability the court would have to identify the indicative sentencing range based on the following matrix, see _Koo Kah Yee_ at \[83\]:

![]([2021] SGMC 0050_Image/[2021] SGMC 0050_image1.png)

55     At the next step the court should assess the harm and culpability at a more granular level and identify an appropriate starting point. The court should then make adjustments for the offender-specific factors and finally consider and make adjustments for the totality principle: see _Koo Kah Yee_ at \[85 to 87\].

##### (3)   Application of the _Koo Kah Yee_ framework to the present case

(A)   Step 1: Level of Harm

56     I agreed with the Prosecution that the applicable factors going towards harm were: (1) the aggregate value of bets involved; and (2) the difficulty of detection.

57     It was a material particular of the s 11 RGA charge that the Accused had facilitated participation of his agents and players to play variants of poker and allowing them to place **a total of not less than $2,166,741.20 in bets**. The Accused has also, unequivocally, admitted that the **total bet volume over the 15 weeks that the club operated was $2,166,741.20**.

58     Therefore, I found that the aggregate value of bets to be considered in determining the level of harm was in excess of $2 million. I did not give weight to the Accused’s contention that the bet value was arbitrary as it did not take into account the fact that players would take turns winning. The clear wording of the charge and the statement of facts is that bets amounting to $2,166,741.20 were wagered by the players during the course of the 15 weeks. I found that this was an objective figure that represented the level of gambling undertaken by the players.

59     I agreed with the Prosecution that there must have been real gains and real losses as a result of the gambling. As the Prosecution submitted, in its reply to the Defence, if a player won money it was open to that player to either exit the game taking his winnings with him or continuing playing and possibly lose his winnings and more.

60     Whilst the quantum of bets involved in the present case was far below the approximately $18 million involved in _Koh Kah Yee_, the sum in the present case was, nonetheless, far higher than the sum involved in _Elger Kua_ (bet value of $159,101), and in two of the sentencing precedents tendered by the Prosecution: i.e. in _Public Prosecutor v Wee Teck Hwee_ (SC-904241-2016) involving a bet value of $635, and _Public Prosecutor v Chen Benhua_ (SC-902721-2018) involving a bet value of $6,215.

61     As held by CJ Menon in _Koo Kah Yee_, the fact that the gambling activities in the present case were offered on an online platform added a further cloak of anonymity to the providers and the participants. This was demonstrated by the fact that the players real names were not identifiable and that they were identified only by their nicknames. Therefore, even after the club ended it would have been difficult to detect the participants in order to take enforcement action against them. The anonymised participants were free to join other clubs and continue their illegal activities. The offences by the co-accused, the agents and the players were innately difficult to detect.

62     However, I did not find that the level of deception in the present case was as great as in _Koo Kah Yee._ In that case, the syndicate had not only used the anonymity of the internet to operate but also conducted their operations behind the veneer of three shell companies, increasing the difficulty of detecting the syndicate and enhancing the assessment of harm. There had been an intensive police probe to uncover the offences: see _Koo Kah Yee_ at \[74\]. Apart from using the internet to operate, the co-accused had not utilised any other means to avoid detection.

63     I also noted that in Koo Kah Yee the offence was syndicated and there was a transnational nature to the syndicate. These were factors that were absent in the present case. Therefore, having considered the quantum of bets involved and the difficulty of detection I found that the level of harm should be pegged at moderate.

64     I disagreed with the Defence submission that there should be parity of sentencing between the Accused and Mr Wong. I would point out that in terms of the level of harm there was a quantitative difference between the value of bets ascribed to the Accused’s offence and the value ascribed to Mr Wong’s offence, see paragraph \[20\] above. As such, I found that the Accused’s offence, in terms of the level of harm, was more egregious than Mr Wong’s.

(B)   Step 1: Culpability

65     I found that there was a degree of planning and premeditation in the present case. The Accused and Mr Tay had agreed that they would host a poker club as a business venture. There was nothing impulsive about their actions.

66     I disagreed with the Defence submission that this was a small and simple operation. The scope of the operation was large as, at its peak, it involved at least 13 agents, 51 unique accounts under the Accused and 50 players under Mr Tay. However, in determining the Accused’s relative culpability, I took into account that the number of agents and players in this operation were about one third the number of players in _Elger Kua._

67     I found that there was no additional level of sophistication. I did not agree with the Prosecution’s submission that the fact that the Accused used his POSBank account to receive and pay money to his agents, players and the other co-accused; or that the co-accused had taken the step to convert the in-game currency to Singapore currency was indicative of a higher level of sophistication. I found that these actions were part and parcel of operating an online gambling venture. The co-accused had also not enhanced the commercially available App in any way.

68     I also did not find the fact that the representative from AceKing contacted Mr Tay and offered a better deal to purchase diamonds as being particularly aggravating, as it was the AceKing representative that had contacted Mr Tay and not the other way round.

69     I found that the Accused played a very active role in the operation. He was one of the two who conceptualized the operation. As stated above, he was one of the masterminds of the operation. The Accused was certainly not a runner or just involved in the administrative aspects of the operation. The Accused had clearly done considerable recruitment as he had seven agents and 51 unique accounts under him. Thus the Accused had obviously actively sourced for new agents and players. As stated in _Khoo Kah Yee_ this was a clear aggravating factor. The Accused, in concert with the other co-Accused, had issued chips to his agents and players, had created virtual tables for the players to play at and had kept track of the players bets. The Accused had been responsible for a key element of the administration in that he would calculate the final profit or loss incurred by each individual player. The Accused was also responsible for settling monies with his agents. It cannot be said that the Accused played a passive role in this enterprise.

70     I found that the duration of the offending was relatively long.

71     I found based on these factors the Accused’s culpability was at the lower end of high culpability. I found that the Accused’s culpability was more egregious that the culpability of the offender in _Khoo Kah Yee._ Although, the syndicate in _Khoo Kah Yee_ was far more sophisticated that in the present case, the offender in _Khoo Kah Yee_, unlike the Accused, was not one of the masterminds of the operations, she was involved in a more administrative role.

(C)   Step 2: The indicative starting range

72     I found that the indicative starting range for moderate harm and high culpability would be a sentence between two and a half years and four years’ imprisonment.

(D)   Step 3: The sentence starting point

73     Having reconsidered the offence-specific factors, and in particular the fact that I found culpability to be at the lower end of the high range, I found that the appropriate starting sentence was 30 months’ imprisonment.

(E)   Step 4: Offender-specific factors

74     The only aggravating factor in the present case was that a charge under s 8(1) RGA was taken into consideration. However, I did not ascribe much weight to this as an aggravating factor. The co-accused were as much players as they were organisers in this operation. The Accused was placing his own bets on poker games that he organised in the club. As such, the quantum of the Accused’s bets have been included in the overall quantum of bets for the s 11 RGA offences.

75     With regard to mitigating factors I give weight to the fact that the Accused had pleaded guilty at an early stage which was a clear indication of his remorse. I accepted that the Accused had been very cooperative with the police during the investigations going so far as to give the police all the relevant passwords so that their investigations would not be impeded. I also gave credit to the fact that the Accused had an otherwise clean record and had kept himself crime-free since he was investigated for these offences. I also took into account the Accused’s relative youth at the time he committed the offence.

76     In view of the lack of aggravating factors and the considerable mitigating factors, I agreed with the Prosecution that a 1/3rd discount to the starting sentence was appropriate. As such I sentenced the Accused to 20 months’ imprisonment.

#### Did the principle of parity of sentencing apply in that the Accused should be sentenced to the same sentence imposed on Mr Wong, i.e. 12 months’ imprisonment.

77     I found that the principle of parity of sentencing did not apply in this case as I found that the Accused’s culpability as well as the level of harm of the Accused’s offence was greater than Mr Wong’s. As I have stated above, the Accused and Mr Tay were the deciding minds in the decision to host the poker club. Mr Wong was recruited by Mr Tay to join them in being a host.

78     I also found that the Accused was clearly more involved in the administration of the venture when compared to Mr Wong, as the Accused was responsible for "tidy(ing) up" the reports that were sent to him by Mr Tay and this included the very important role of calculating the final profit made or loss incurred by the individual players. The Accused's calculations formed the basis for the week's settlement of monies. In comparison, Wong only fulfilled this role on one or two occasions during the lifetime of the club.

79     As stated above, the Accused had brought in seven agents and 51 unique accounts. This was far more agents and players than Mr Wong had brought in or had under him. At the club’s peak, Mr Wong had only three players under him. Finally, I agree with the Prosecution that the fact that the Accused and Mr Tay were able to downgrade Mr Wong to an agent because they felt that Mr Wong was not "bringing in enough players" would give weight to the finding that the Accused and Mr Tay played a greater managerial role and were more culpable than Mr Wong.

80     I also found that there was a material difference in terms of the harm that caused by the offence committed by the Accused compared to Mr Wong. The quantum of bets involved in the offence involving the Accused was over $2 million. In comparison, the quantum of bets involved in the offence involving Mr Wong was $1.08 million, about half the amount. Thus, the harm caused as a result of the Accused's offence was greater than the harm cause as a result of Mr Wong's offence.

#### Sentencing precedents

81     I did not compare the sentence I found to be appropriate in this case against the sentences imposed in unreported cases, either s 11 of the RGA or Common Gaming Houses Act/Betting Act cases. However, I did consider the sentences imposed in both _Elger Kua_ and _Khoo Kah Yee._

82     In _Elger Kua_, the offender was sentenced to 14 months’ imprisonment and a fine of $40,000. I found that the level of harm in _Elger Kua_, in terms of the overall quantum of bets, was far less egregious than the present case.

83     With regard to the offender’s culpability in _Elger Kua_, the offender had been operating his club since August 2016. However, the offender was not charged for providing remote gaming for the period August 2016 to January 2017, the offending period in his charge was between 8 January to 14 January. I found that in terms of the duration of the operation, the facts of the present case were far more egregious. The co-accused’s operation ran consistently for 15 weeks, a period that was far longer the period in _Elger Kua_. Even if the entire period that the offender in _Elger Kua’s_ club was in operation, i.e. from August 2016 to January 2017, the period of six months was only slightly longer than the period in the present case, i.e. almost four months.

84     There was evidence that the offender in _Elger Kua_ profited from his remote gambling operation. In the present case there was no evidence that the co-accused had profited. I would accept that on this factor, the culpability of the offender in _Elger Kua_ is greater than the Accused’s culpability. I also accepted that the offender in _Elger Kua_ had not voluntarily brought the operation to an end, unlike the co-accused in the present case.

85     However, based on the huge disparity between the harm occasioned in the present case, i.e. over $2 million in bets placed compared to the approximately $160,000 in _Elger Kua_; and in view of the duration of the offending stated in the charge, in the present case 15 weeks as compared to the one week in _Elger Kua_, I found that the Accused’s offence was more egregious than the offender in _Elger Kua._ As such, I found that the Accused’s sentence should be higher than the sentence in _Elger Kua._

86     The offender in _Khoo Kah Yee_ was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment. However, based on the application of the framework to the offence by the offender in _Khoo Kah Yee_, Menon CJ found that the indicative sentencing range should have been between two and a half and four and a half years’ imprisonment and a starting sentence of two and a half years’ imprisonment would have been appropriate; see _Khoo Kah Yee_ at \[84 & 85\].

87     Menon CJ went on to hold that the appropriate sentence for the offender in _Khoo Kah Yee_, having considered the aggravating and mitigating factors was a sentence of two years’ imprisonment and that, in fact, there was ample basis for an uplift in the sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment imposed at first instance. However, as the Prosecution had not filed an appeal against sentence, Menon CJ did not disturb the District Judge’s sentence; see _Khoo Kah Yee_ at \[88 & 90\].

88     I have found that the Accused’s culpability in the present case was higher than the offender in _Khoo Kah Yee_, as the Accused was one of the masterminds behind the operation, unlike the offender in _Khoo Kah Yee._ In terms of the gravity of the offences in both cases, it was true that the level or harm (in terms of the quantum of the bet), the difficulty of detection, the syndicated and transnational nature, and the sophistication of the offending in _Khoo_ was far more egregious than the present case. However, these factors would have translated into a far higher sentence for the offender, even with a lower personal level of culpability, had the sentencing framework been utilised.

89     As such, I found that the sentence of 20 months’ imprisonment was not excessive when compared to the 24 months’ imprisonment Menon CJ found was appropriate for the offender in _Khoo Kah Yee_.

## Conclusion

90     I found that a global sentence of 20 months’ imprisonment for the s 11 RGA offence was not disproportionate to the scale of the Accused’s offending and it was not a crushing sentence.

91     Finally, I would express my gratitude to the Prosecution and Defence for their well-reasoned arguments, both written and oral, and the invaluable assistance that they rendered to me.
