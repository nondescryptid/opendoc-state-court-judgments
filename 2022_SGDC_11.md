\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9248/2021/01.\]

10 January 2022

### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## Background

1       The accused is Ms Gan Beng Hong, a female Singaporean, who was 51 years of age at the time of her arrest on 4 August 2018. She had claimed trial to a charge under s 8(a) and punishable under s 33(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”):

> ….are charged that you, on 1 August 2018, at or about 5.59am, at 8 Bayfront Avenue, Marina Bay Sands, Singapore 018955, Casino, did have in your possession a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), to wit, one packet containing not less 0.44 gram of crystalline substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 0.29 gram of methamphetamine, without any authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder and you have thereby committed an offence under section 8(a) and punishable under section 33(1) of the said Act.

2       At the conclusion of the trial, as I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt, I convicted the accused on the charge in DAC 930659 of 2018. On 1 November 2021, I sentenced the accused to nine months’ imprisonment.

3       The accused is dissatisfied with my decision and has filed an appeal against her conviction and sentence on 1 November 2021. She is currently on bail pending the hearing of her appeal. A stay of execution was granted for the sentence of imprisonment.

4       I now set out the grounds of my decision in full.

## Circumstances leading to her arrest and charge

5       On 1 August 2018 at about 1:38am, the accused entered the Marina Bay Sands (“MBS”) casino located at 8 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore. On the same day at about 5:59am, she exited from Basement 2 of the MBS casino. Whilst doing so, she dropped a small packet containing crystalline substance from her mobile phone case onto the floor and left the premise without retrieving the small packet.

6       On 2 August 2018, an MBS security officer discovered the said small packet on the floor near to the exit of Basement 2 called the police for assistance and lodged the first information report.

7       On 2 August 2018, a team of police officers arrived at the MBS casino and seized the small packet of crystalline substance. Based on their review of the security footage, they discovered that on 1 August 2018 at about 5:59am the accused had dropped the small packet of crystalline substance from her mobile phone as she was exiting the casino. The accused left the premises without retrieving the small packet.

8       On 2 August 2018 at about 10:47am, a police report was lodged pertaining the seizure of one clear Ziploc bag containing white crystallized substance. The case was then referred to the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) for further investigation.

9       On 4 August 2018 at about 12:21am when the accused entered the MBS casino, she was detained by the MBS security team. On the same day at 3:10am, the police arrested the accused.

10     The seized Ziploc bag containing the crystallised substance was placed in a sealed tamper proof bag and submitted on 6 August 2018 at 2:23pm to the Illicit Drugs Laboratory of the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”). There was no break in the chain of custody vis-à-vis the small packet of crystalline substance between the time it fell from the accused’s mobile phone onto the floor near the exit of Basement 2 level of the MBS casino and the time it was submitted to the Illicit Drugs Laboratory of the HSA.

11     On 31 August 2018, Analyst Chin Shi Liy Reenie issued one HSA certificate indicating that the said packet contained not less than 0.44g of crystalline substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 0.29g of methamphetamine.

12     Prior to dropping the small packet of crystalline substance on the floor of Basement 2 level of the MBS casino on 1 August 2018 at about 5:59am, the accused possessed the said small packet.

13     Methamphetamine is a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA. The accused was not authorised under the MDA or the regulations made thereunder to possess methamphetamine.

## The law

14     The elements of the offence of drug possession are:

> (a)     the accused must be in possession of a controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA; and

> (b)     the accused knows the nature of the controlled drug.

15     Knowledge of the nature of the drugs can be proved or presumed pursuant to s 18(2) of the MDA, which states:

> **Presumption of possession and knowledge of controlled drugs**

> 18\. –(2)    Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have known the nature of that drug.

## Prosecution’s case

16     It is the Prosecution’s case that as the accused had admitted to the possession of the small packet containing the crystalline substance, pursuant to s 18(2) of the MDA, the accused is presumed to know the nature of the drugs. The burden thus shifted to the accused to prove on a balance of probabilities that she did not know the nature of the drugs.

## Defence’s case

17     It is the Defence’s case that she has discharged her burden of proof on a balance of probabilities as she was unaware of the nature of the drugs.

## Issues

18     The issues for my determination were whether:

> (a)     the accused’s cautioned statement (P10) and her long statement (P11) were made voluntarily;

> (b)     the accused had rebutted the presumption of knowledge of the nature of the substance under s 18(2) of the MDA on balance of probabilities.

#### Voluntariness of her statements

19     As the accused had challenged the voluntariness of her cautioned statement and long statement, I held two ancillary hearings to determine the voluntariness of these statements.

20     S 258(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) reads as follows:

> (3)    The court shall refuse to admit the statement of an accused or allow it to be used in the manner referred to in subsection (1) if the making of the statement appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise having reference to the charge against the accused, proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient, in the opinion of the court, to give the accused grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making the statement he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him.

21     There are two limbs to the test of voluntariness (see _Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 619</span> (“_Chai Chien Wei Kelvin_”) at \[53\]). The first limb is an objective one and concerns whether a threat, inducement or promise was actually made. The second limb is a subjective one and it concerns whether the threat, inducement or promise “operate\[d\] on the mind of the particular accused through hope of escape or fear of punishment connected with the charge”.

22     The burden is on the Prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the statements were made voluntarily, rather than on the Defence to prove on a balance of probabilities that the statements were not made voluntarily (see _Chai Chien Wei Kelvin_ at \[53\]; _Public Prosecutor v Mohamed Ansari bin Mohamed Abdul Aziz and another_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 268</span> (“_Mohamed Ansari_”) at \[9\]).

#### First ancillary hearing

23     In the present case, the accused alleged that her cautioned statement on 12 September 2018 at 1550 hours was involuntary for the following reasons:

> (a)     An alleged inducement from the recorder, Staff Sergeant Muhammad Thobraani Bin Mohd Soom (PW8) when he said “No need to go to jail”;

> (b)     The accused had a headache and was in pain;

> (c)     An alleged language barrier as her statement was recorded in English when her command of the language was poor.

#### Inducement from PW8

24     In the present case, I accepted PW8’s clear and credible evidence that throughout the statement recording process he had not offered any inducement, threat or promise to the accused. I agreed with the Prosecution and rejected the accused’s allegation of an inducement from PW8 as the accused was unable to particularise the alleged inducement she received. There were no preconditions attached to the alleged phrase and as such could not amount to an inducement which had operated on her mind.

25     I further agreed with the Prosecution that it was highly coincidental that the only phrase she could recall understanding was one that appears to absolve her of a custodial sentence. In addition, her allegation had been rejected by PW8 and the accused herself could not think of a reason for him to lie on the stand.

#### Headache and pain

26     In respect of her claim that she had a headache and was in pain, I accepted the Prosecution’s submissions that it was inherently incredible that she made no mention of it to PW8. I further agreed with the Prosecution that notwithstanding that she constantly feels this pain, she was able to function normally, whether in running her stall six days a week or going to MBS for a few hours to gamble. It was undisputed that she made no mention of this pain to either PW8 or to anyone or requested PW8 to stop recording P10 because of the pain that she was allegedly suffering.

27     Furthermore, I accepted PW8’s credible and consistent evidence that she had not appeared to be suffering from pain at the time of the recording. I agreed with the Prosecution that as evident from her testimony in court, the accused was clearly capable of displaying external observable signs when she is in pain. In my view, this claim that she had a headache and was in pain at the time the statement was recorded was a fabricated afterthought in her attempt to preclude the Prosecution from relying on the incriminating portions of her cautioned statement as part of its case.

#### Language barrier

28     In respect of her claim of a language barrier, I agreed with the Prosecution that it was incredible that the accused had chosen not to inform that she could not understand what he was saying. The accused herself had confirmed that she knew that it was important for her to provide her defence to the police to exonerate herself from the charge.

29     I further agreed that it was incredible that she would sign a statement multiple times if she did not understand what PW8 was saying. This is especially given that she was aware that she was facing a criminal investigation and was at risk of incarceration.

30     I accepted PW8’s credible and clear account that he was able to understand the accused and that the accused could understand him. I also accepted his evidence that he would have arranged for an interpreter if there were any language barrier. The accused herself could not provide any reason as to why PW8 would lie about this aspect of his evidence.

31     It was the Prosecution’s case, that the contents of the cautioned statement include information that could only have come from the accused. This includes the fact that (a) she had a stall which was her income and (b) she is the only one supporting her son. I agreed with the Prosecution that the inclusion of such information contradicts the accused’s claim that she could not communicate with PW8 due to a language barrier. I further agreed that this showed that PW8 had dutifully recorded what the accused had told him in the cautioned statement.

32     In the present case, I rejected her claim that her command and understanding of simple English was so limited that she was unable to understand PW8 or the contents of her own statement when it was read back to her by PW8. I agreed with the Prosecution that she had invented this language barrier in a desperate but futile bid to retract her admission of guilt in her cautioned statement.

33     In fact, I observed that during the ancillary hearing, she was able to understand and respond to the Prosecution’s question without waiting for the assistance of the Mandarin interpreter[^1].

Q

 | 

Mdm. Gan, you need to listen to the question a bit more carefully. My question is, you did not ask IO Leong what would happen to you after he helps you, correct?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes, I did not ask.

 |
| 

Chin:

 | 

Madam Interpreter, I note that Mdm. Gan had answered my question before you interpreted it to her, correct?

 |
| 

Interpreter:

 | 

Yes, Your Honour. Interpreter confirm that in fact Mdm. Gan say that for this question, “You already interpreted to me earlier.” When he \[sic\] said “You”, you refer---she refers to the interpreter.

 |

  
  

34     I disagreed with the Defence that the cautioned statement should be excluded as evidence because the prejudicial effect outweighs the probative value as per _R v Sang_ \[1980\] 2 AC 402 which was affirmed by the Court of Appeal in _Muhammad Bin Kadar v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 3 SLR 1205</span>. For reasons as stated above, I did not accept the Defence’s position that the statement recording process was defective due to her claim of a language barrier and her inability to understand PW8. In my view, PW8 had complied with the proper procedure as set out in s 23 of the CPC when he recorded the cautioned statement from the accused on 12 September 2018.

35     Hence, I found that the Prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the cautioned statement (P10) had been given voluntarily. Hence, I admitted it as part of the Prosecution’s evidence. I also found that the Defence had not proven on a balance of probabilities that there was inducement by PW8 which operated on the mind of the accused. I did not think the Defence had established that there was a procedural irregularity in the statement recording process such that the prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value.

36     In her cautioned statement, the accused had stated the following:

> I want to say that I have a stall which is my income. I hope that I can be given a chance. I want to say that I am the only one support my son. It is my first time. I know it is wrong and I stopped. I hope I can be given a chance and not go to jail.

37     I now turn to the long statement.

#### Second ancillary hearing

38     The accused alleged that her long statement on 4 August 2018 at 1430 hours was involuntary as Senior Staff Sergeant Leong Tuck Ming Johnson (PW9) had promised to help her. She had also alleged that her long statement was not accurately recorded by PW9.

#### PW9’s promise to help

39     The accused had testified that she had told PW9 that she did not quite understand English. PW9 assured her not to worry and that he would help her. According to her, PW9 asked her to be at ease and finish the statement recording. She further testified that PW9 had asked her to say out what had happened and to just tell the truth. If she did not do anything wrong, there will be no problem.

40     The accused testified that after PW9 had completed typing the long statement, he had explained to her what she had told him earlier. She disagreed with PW9’s evidence that he had printed a copy of the statement before explaining the contents to her. Instead, she alleged that PW9 had read out her statement from the computer and thereafter printed it out for her to sign. It was only a year later when her previous lawyer Mr Foo Ho Chew had read out her long statement that she realised that some parts in the content was not what she had said and some of what she had told him was not in the statement.

41     In the present case, I accepted PW9’s clear and credible evidence that throughout the statement recording process he had not offered any inducement, threat or promise to the accused. I agreed with the Prosecution that for a promise to render a statement inadmissible, the promise must induce the making of the statement, have some reference to the charge against the accused and must come from a person of authority (see _Poh Kay Keong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] 3 SLR(R) 887</span>). The promise must be sufficient to give her grounds which would appear to her reasonable for supposing that by making this statement, she would gain an advantage.

42     I further agreed with the Prosecution that even by the accused’s own version there was no precondition attached to this offer to help. I accepted the Prosecution’s submissions that being investigated for the first time and allegedly fearing incarceration, it was incredible that the accused did not seek clarification on how PW9 would help her. In any event, I accepted that such a statement was too vague to induce the accused into making this statement. In fact, by her own account she testified that she was asked by PW9 to say out what had happened and to just tell the truth. If she did not do anything wrong, there will be no problem. In my view if her account were to be accepted, there was nothing untoward about what PW9 had said to her.

43     In respect of her claim that she was induced by PW9’s promise to help her, I agreed with the Prosecution that there was no reason for PW9 to do so and there was also no reason for him to lie about not doing so. In any event, there was no evidence from the accused as to how PW9 was to help her as according to her, she herself did not know how this help would be carried out and what conclusion this help would steer towards. Accordingly, I rejected her claim that she had given the statement on account of PW9’s alleged promise to help her.

#### Accuracy of statement

44     I agreed with the Prosecution that the issue of accuracy is a matter of weight to be given to the statement and not its admissibility. In the present case, I accepted PW9’s evidence that after he finished typing the entire statement, he had read back the statement to her and explained the statement to the accused in Mandarin. The accused was then invited to make any amendment or deletion and thereafter invited to sign on her statement.

45     I was mindful that during her own examination-in-chief, she had initially testified that PW9 had explained the statement in accordance with what she had told him earlier. Nevertheless, her position shifted shortly after when she claimed that after her previous lawyer read out to the statement, part of it was what she had told PW9 and there were parts of what she told him that were not in the statement. In the present case, I rejected the accused’s claim that her long statement was not accurately recorded. I agreed with the Prosecution that there was no reason for PW9 to falsely implicate her. I further agreed with the Prosecution that the lack of complaint from the accused as to accuracy of the statement prior to the trial including in her Case for Defence corroborated the accuracy of the statement.

46     Hence, I found that the Prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the long statement (P11) had been given voluntarily. Hence, I admitted it as part of the Prosecution’s evidence. I also found that the Defence had not proven on a balance of probabilities that there was a promise by PW9 which operated on the mind of the accused and induced her to give the statement nor was it proven that the statement was not accurately recorded.

47     Apart from relating her personal background, the accused had provided an account of the events leading to her arrest as well as the urine procurement process. The incriminating portions of her long statement are set out below:

> 10    I am now been informed that my urine test was found to be positive for Amphetamine. I do admit that I have smoked “ice”. Till date, I have smoked “ice” twice. It all started when one of my Malaysian friends handed over a small packet of “ice” to me. This Malaysian girlfriend of mine, known as “Merlin”, happened to bump into me at my food stall on the 29/07/2018. We know each other when I was running a food stall in Woodlands about 10 years ago. We were very close till today. I do not know if she is still working in Singapore. The last I heard was that the mixed vegetable stall, which “Merlin” was working in, had closed down.

> 11    When “Merlin” saw me, she noticed that I had lost a lot of weight. I did tell her that I have a tumour in me after I went for a blood test. After knowing that I have a tumour in me, I did not go for any further medical checkup because I do not have the courage to face the reality. “Merlin” then handed over a small packet of “ice” to me. She told me that by smoking this, it can help me to feel relaxed. She even told me to use the simplest method to smoke the “ice”.

> 12    Out of curiosity, I then went back home and try the “ice” alone in my kitchen toilet. I first get ready a piece of aluminium foil and then poured some “ice” onto it. I then used a lighter to heat up the bottom of the foil till the “ice” melted. Lastly, I use a cut straw to suck in the smoke from the melted “ice”. After a few puffs, I did not feel any relaxing but my hands were shivering. After my first try, I heard my Eden just got home. I quickly throw away all the used aluminium foil and kept the remaining packet of “ice” together with my handphone. Prior to my arrest, I did smoke “ice” for the second time on Monday (30/07/2018) night. I smoked it alone in my house toilet. This time, I felt the same like smoking a cigarette. After that, I then kept the packet of “ice” back into my handphone.

> 13    I am now shown a photograph of one plastic packet containing crystalline substance, marked as “NO-1”. I am now being informed by IO that this packet was dropped from my handphone when I was leaving MBS on 01/08/2018 at about 06:00 am. I admit that this packet of “ice” belongs to me. This is the one which was given to me for free from “Merlin” on 29/07/2018. I seriously do not take into any account that I have lost this packet of “ice” at the MBS casino because I am not a heavy drug addict. I was surprised when the MBS security officers stopped me when entering the casino last night. It was then that I found out that I have committed drug offencs with regard to this packet of “ice” which was dripped out from my handphone.

> 14    Other than “ice”, I do not abuse any other controlled drugs. None of my friends or my family members know that I had smoked and in possession of “ice”. This is my first time committing a serious offence. I hope that the authority can have some leniency on me. I really cannot go to prisons because both my sons need my support.

#### The main trial

48     The trial turned on whether the accused had proven on a balance of probabilities that she was unaware of the nature of the drugs.

49     It was the case for the Defence that the accused’s friend one ‘Merlin’ had given her the said packet of crystalline substance to manage the pain from the headaches she suffered but had not told her the nature of the substance.

## The Defence

#### History of headaches

50     The accused gave evidence that before 29 July 2018, she had been having headaches for more than 30 years. According to her after her divorce in 2009 as she faced a lot of issues such as money and her children, the pain level went up. She further gave evidence that to manage the pain, she took painkillers to stop the pain. It was only between 2012 or 2013, she started to go to the Singapore General Hospital (“SGH”) to get medicine to relax her brain and to stop the pain.

51     The accused testified that at the end of 2016, the doctor checked and told her that she had cancer. She stopped going to the hospital because she was afraid to find out the truth. According to her, she also took alternative medication for her cancer ‘to disappear from her body’.

#### Meeting with Merlin

52     The accused testified that she first received the crystalline substance on 29 July 2018 from her friend ‘Merlin’ whom she had not seen for more than ten years at a coffee shop. During her testimony, I observed that although she initially described Merlin as a good friend, immediately after she stated that she was just a friend she knew when they worked in the same coffee shop together. I also observed that in her long statement, she had stated that Merlin and her ‘were very close till today’.

53     She further testified that after she told Merlin about her very bad headaches and that she might have a tumour, Merlin gave her a packet of crystalline substance. The accused further testified that Merlin told her that the substance will help her reduce her headache and make her relax. Merlin told her the method of consuming the substance was by smoking.

54     The accused and Merlin went into a toilet cubicle together and Merlin demonstrated to the accused as to how to smoke the substance. According to her, Merlin took an aluminium foil and used a lighter to heat up the substance. She then asked the accused to inhale the smoke. The accused testified that after inhaling the smoke, she did not feel anything. Merlin told the accused that her pass or permit was about to expire and that she would go back to Malaysia in a day or two days. If she happened to come out again, she would go and look for the accused. The accused further testified that she did not have Merlin’s contact number nor her residential address in Malaysia.

55     The accused gave evidence that the second time she consumed the substance that Merlin gave her was in her kitchen toilet on 30 July 2018. When her son came home, she cleared the substance and kept the packet of substance in her handphone cover. She threw away the aluminium foil she had used to smoke the substance by flushing it down the toilet.

56     She further gave evidence that on 1 August 2018, she went to the MBS casino as she was bored after having slept for quite a long time. She took Panadol Extra as she felt some pain. She then played at the jackpot machine for three hours before leaving. She testified that she was arrested on 4 August 2018 at MBS when she was about to enter the casino. She was informed by the security officer that the police were called as she had dropped a packet of items that was illegal.

#### Expert evidence

57     Dr Zhao Yi Jing (DW2), a consultant neurologist at the National Neuroscience Institute (“NNI”) testified that she first reviewed the accused on 20 March 2020 and last saw her on 3 August 2021. She had been referred by Toa Payoh Polyclinic on the 19 August 2019 for headaches. DW2 also testified that the accused saw Dr Deidre Ann De Silva in Singapore General Hospital (“SGH”) from 2012 to 2015 for her headache.

58     In her medical report dated 7 April 2021 on the accused (D2), DW2 indicated that the accused has been diagnosed with chronic migraine and had listed out the medication she had been prescribed with. According to the medical history of her first visit to NNI – SGH on 19 August 2019, the accused first had headache in her childhood years and was diagnosed with childhood migraine since she was 10 years old. The worsening of the headache started about one year prior to August 2019.

59     In paragraph (f) of D2, DW2’s opined as follows:

> As chronic migraine is a condition where patient reports verbally their level of pain, and it is not a condition whose severity of disease can be measured by clinical investigations, whether the patient is fit to stand trial will also be purely a subjective report from the patient themselves. Base on the latest clinical notes, she did not report any interference of her migraine with activities of daily living.

60     When asked by the Defence how migraine affects a person’s thinking or cognitive ability, DW2 gave evidence that for patients with migraine aura or language aura, their ability to understand and verbalise is impaired. This occurs with 10 to 20% of patients with migraine.

61     When asked by the Defence whether on 4 August 2018 during the period of worsening of the migraine whether there was a possibility of impaired understanding and verbalisation on the accused’s part, DW2 testified that from the clinical notes there was no documentation of migraine with aura. She further clarified that from 1 August 2018 until her last visit on 3 August 2021, it was not ascertained whether she had been suffering from an impairment of verbalisation and understanding.

## Analysis of Defence

62     In the present case, it was clear that the accused’s claim that she did not know the nature of the drugs was contradicted by the evidence from her own statements as well as her own testimony of the circumstances in which she obtained and consumed the drugs. In her cautioned statement, the accused had admitted to wrongdoing and pleaded for leniency. In her long statement, the accused had admitted to knowing that the drugs were “ice”. She alleged that she was not a heavy drug addict and denied consuming any other controlled drug apart from “ice”.

63     I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused’s denial of knowledge was wholly incredible given the suspicious and surreptitious manner which she had obtained the drugs. In particular, the accused claimed that she made no enquiries regarding the nature of the drugs despite the following circumstances:

> (a)     She received the drugs from Merlin, an individual who she had not met for more than ten years;

> (b)     Merlin taught the accused how to consume the drugs in a manner which differed from any other type of medication;

> (c)     Merlin went to the coffeeshop toilet and entered the accused’s toilet cubicle to teach her how to consume the drugs away from public sight.

64     I agreed with the Prosecution that it was wholly incredible that the accused would readily accept and consume unknown substances in such a unique manner, from an individual she had not met in more than ten years, without making any enquiries whatsoever. I did not accept the Defence’s submission that the accused did not ask Merlin what the substance on account of her history of headaches. I was mindful that her complaint of headaches and her claim of the use of the substance for pain relief was conspicuously absent in both her cautioned statement and her long statement as well as the Case For The Defence filed on 6 April 2019 (D1).

65     It is also unbelievable that the said Merlin would randomly give controlled drugs to the accused and teach her how to consume it without making any mention of its nature. I was mindful that Merlin was not called as defence witness. I also agreed with the Prosecution that the accused had not adduced any evidence that the said Merlin in fact exists.

66     The accused’s denial of knowledge was also incompatible with her decision to keep the drugs in her possession. According to her testimony, she had consumed the drugs to alleviate the pain from her headache. Nevertheless, by her own account, despite consuming it twice, she felt no effect whatsoever. Accordingly, she would have no reason to continue possessing the drugs given their seeming uselessness. An irresistible inference that could be drawn was that she had kept the drugs in her mobile phone cover to continue to use it as it helped her to get high. I agreed with the Prosecution that she must therefore have known the illicit nature of the drugs when she brought it into the MBS casino.

67     I rejected the Defence’s submissions that the accused had inadvertently put the substance in the cover of the mobile phone and that she had inadvertently brought her mobile phone with the substance without actually knowing that it was inside. I also agreed with the Prosecution that the accused’s repeated claim that she “did not think so much” was unbelievable. By her own admission, she had seen “matters about drugs on the television” and knew that it was illegal to consume drugs. At the time of the offence, the accused was a 51-year-old mother who had operated her own food stall for many years. She was not as naïve as she had attempted to make herself out to be who would unthinkingly receive and consume drugs.

68     I disagreed with the Defence’s portrayal of the accused as being an unsophisticated person who was more concerned about getting a new form of relief to ease her headaches. It was unbelievable that she would consume a foreign substance without question merely because it was recommended by someone who according to her latest position, was a just friend whom she had not met for more than ten years.

69     After a careful consideration of the evidence before me, I found that the accused’s statements, P10 and P11 were accurately recorded and gave full weight to them. Hence, I found that the accused had failed to adduce any evidence to rebut the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA on a balance of probabilities.

70     After having carefully considered the totality of the evidence as well as the submissions by both the Prosecution and the accused, I was satisfied that at the Close of Defence that the Prosecution had established its case in respect of the charge in DAC 930659-2018 beyond a reasonable doubt and convicted her on the charge.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed Penalty

#### s 8(a) of the MDA

71     The prescribed penalty for an offence of drug possession is a term of imprisonment of up to ten years or $20,000 or to both.

## Antecedents

72     The accused was untraced.

## Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

73     In its oral address on sentence, it was submitted that the benchmark sentence for possession of a small quantity of drugs as set out in _PP v Lim Cheng Ji Alvin_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 671</span> (“_Alvin Lim_”) is between eight to 12 months’ imprisonment. In the present case, the Prosecution sought a sentence within that range.

74     It was submitted that there were no key mitigating factors that would warrant a departure from this benchmark.

75     It was the Prosecution’s case that no mitigating weight should be placed on the 8 November 2019 psychiatric report of Dr Ung Eng Khean (“Dr Ung”) that was included by the Defence in its Closing Submissions. It was submitted that Dr Ung’s diagnosis was unreliable as the accused had lied to them _ie_ Dr Ung and his counsellor Mr Albert Seow. It was highlighted that in Part E and paragraph 9 of Dr Ung’s report that his opinion is predicated on truthfulness of the information provided by the accused.

76     It was submitted at paragraph 35 of Dr Ung’s report, he had stated the following:

> Experts acknowledge that depression can result in poor judgment and impulsivity i.e. not checking beforehand that the substance was legal…”

It was the Prosecution’s case that based on the Court’s findings, this was clearly untrue. It was submitted that the accused did know that the substance was illegal and she made a conscious decision to possess and consume the substance.

77     It was further submitted that at paragraph 34 of Dr Ung’s report, the accused’s account to Dr Ung was that her motivation for using the drug was pain relief for her chronic headache was conspicuously absent in her statements.

78     It was the Prosecution’s case that the accused had lied to Dr Ung that she had been on follow-up with SGH for the last five to six years. It was submitted that her own witness, Dr Zhao (DW2) had clearly stated that the accused was not seen at SGH for headache management between 2015 and 2019. It was further submitted that as the offence was committed in 2018, on that basis no weight can be placed upon Dr Ung’s report.

## Mitigation

79     In the written Closing Submissions, the Defence had pre-emptively submitted that if the Court were to convict the accused could avail herself to a non-custodial sentence. In support of this position, the Defence had referred to the High Court decision on _Mohamad Fairuuz bin Saleh v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 1 SLR 1145</span> (“_Fairuuz_ case”) and an article (Darius Chan, Senior Associate, Norton Rose Fulbright (Asia) LLP, Probing the Law on Probation: Suggestions for Reform _Mohamad Fairuuz bin Saleh v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 264</span>, February 2015 issue of the Law Gazette) that a probation order could be granted to an older offender (who is above 21 years of age) so long as there is no “mandatory minimum sentence” and/or “specified minimum sentence”.

80     It was further submitted that in _Kanagaratnam Nicholas Jens v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 887</span> (“Nicholas Jens”), the High Court held that “rehabilitation may be the dominant sentencing consideration in a ‘purely exceptional case’, such as where an offender could prove that he was suffering from a psychiatric or other condition that was in some way causally related to his drug offences.”

81     It was the Defence’s case that in Dr Ung’s Psychiatric Report \[41\] to \[43\], it was stated that:

> (a)     The accused’s use of methamphetamine is a one-off incident and she has no prior history of illicit drug abuse or dependence;

> (b)     She has little risk of recidivism;

> (c)     Her depression would improve with treatment;

> (d)     Her education was simple and basic and that would explain why she ended up using the substance;

> (e)     She now has good insight and acknowledged of the factors that had been at play leading to her having possession of the substance and she had done her best to be co-operative during investigation;

> (f)     She had too easily trusted her friend as well as being too impulsive to seek relief for her headaches;

> (g)     She had good history of working to support herself and her son.

82     It was the Defence’s case that Dr Ung had diagnosed her at \[32\] of his report that

> “Her state of milder but chronic depression prior to and during her offence would correspond to one of Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia).”

83     In the circumstances, it was submitted that the accused be considered for probation or a non-custodial sentence and that a pre-sentencing probation report be called. It was further submitted that she could not afford to go for a term of imprisonment as she needs to support herself and her son financially. She would also need to keep her stall going.

## Prosecution’s Reply

84     In response to the plea in mitigation, it was highlighted by the Prosecution that even if the accused suffers from depression, this had no contribution to the offending because she lied to Dr Ung about why she took the drug.

85     It was further submitted that the accused had lied to Dr Ung about what she knew about the drug.

## Decision on Sentence

86     In my determination of the appropriate sentence to be imposed, I was guided by the High Court decision in _PP v Lim Cheng Ji Alvin_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 671</span>. In _Alvin Lim_, the High Court had affirmed the sentencing range of between six to 18 months’ imprisonment for a first offender who was charged with possession of a Class A drug in _Dinesh Singh s/o Amarjeet Singh v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 3 SLR(R) 1</span> (“_Dinesh Singh_”).

87     At \[7\] of _Alvin Lim_, in respect of the appropriate sentencing approach the High Court held:

> …But that is not all: the different approach for young offenders is also justified for two other reasons at least. The first is that the young may know no better; some regard should therefore be had to the fact that the limited nature and extent of their life experiences might explain their actions and justify some consideration being extended to them. The second is that with young offenders, society generally has an especially strong interest in their rehabilitation; their diversion from the prison environment is therefore a desirable goal where this would enhance their prospects of rehabilitation (see _PP v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 439</span> at \[21\]).

> This is not presumptively the case with an older offender. Instead, particularly in the context of drug offences, as is the case here, the law is clear that deterrence is the dominant consideration and, save for the “purely exceptional case”, a custodial term is usually warranted: _Dinesh_ Singh Bhatia _s/o Amarjeet Singh v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 3 SLR(R) 1</span> (“_Dinesh Singh_”) at \[59\] (and see more below at \[17\]–\[19\]). Precedents where probation, instead of a sentence of imprisonment, has been ordered for older drug offenders involved those who were suffering from psychiatric or other conditions that were in some way causally related to their offences.

88     In the present case, as the accused was 51 years old at the time of the offence, deterrence is clearly the dominant sentencing consideration for an offence of drug possession.

89     The Defence Counsel had relied on _Fairuuz_’s case in support of his submissions for a probation order. In my view, _Fairuuz_’s case would not assist the Defence in view of its different factual matrix. The offender there was found guilty and convicted of an offence under s 5(1) read with ss 14(1)(b)(i) and 14(1A)(a) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed). A similar charge involving a separate bank account was taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. As highlighted above, deterrence is the dominant sentencing consideration particularly for drug offences. In my view, a probation order would clearly not be an appropriate sentence in the present case.

90     Furthermore, I did not find that there were facts that would put the present case within the category of an exceptional case. In seeking a non-custodial sentence, the Defence had sought to rely on Part M and paragraph 35 of Dr Ung’s psychiatric report which states that:

> Her depressive disorder will have increased her impulsivity and worsened her judgment, contributing to her committing the offence. In this sense, there is a notion of ‘causality’ linking her Depressive Order with her offending disorder.

91     What was notable was that although at Part G paragraph 15 of Dr Ung’s 8 November 2019 psychiatric report, the accused had given an account that she felt depressed for a considerable amount of time prior to the charge, there was no mention of this depressed state in her evidence throughout the trial. I also observed that Dr Ung had not made a definitive finding that there was a causal connection between her depressive disorder and the commission of the offence. Instead, he had the word ‘causality’ in parenthesis and had described it as a being a notion.

92     I agreed with the Prosecution that Dr Ung’s diagnosis was unreliable as the accused had lied in her account to Dr Ung and his counsellor Mr Albert Seow. I further agreed with the Prosecution that no weight should be given to his psychiatric report as his opinion was predicated on truthfulness of the information provided by the accused.

93     I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused was not truthful to Dr Ung in her account of what she knew about the drug unlike what she had stated in her long statement on the day of her arrest. In the present case, even if I accept that the accused was suffering from a depressive disorder, I was not satisfied that there was indeed a causal link between her disorder and her drug possession.

94     I further agreed with the Prosecution that the accused’s account to Dr Ung was that her motivation for using the drug was pain relief for her chronic headache was conspicuously absent in both her cautioned statement and her long statement. Instead in her long statement (P11), she had stated at \[11\] that she told Merlin that she had a tumour in her after she went for a blood test. It was then that Merlin handed the small packet of ice and she told the accused by smoking it, it would help her feel relaxed.

95     In addition, I also agreed with the Prosecution’s case that the accused had lied to Dr Ung that she had been on follow-up with SGH for the last five to six years. Further, I noted that she had also lied to Dr Ung when she stated that she had just been seen at SGH for her headache just before the charge (29th July 2018). This was in view of Dr Zhao’s (DW2) testimony that the accused was not seen at SGH for headache management between 2015 and 2019.

96     I also noted that the accused had testified that at the end of 2016, the doctor checked and told her that she had cancer. Yet, in Dr Ung’s report it was stated that in 2013, she suffered severe anxiety after she was told that a blood cancer test taken at NUH that she might be suffering from nasopharyngeal cancer and that she would require further testing.

97     In my view, there was no reliable evidence placed before me that the accused suffering from psychiatric or other conditions that was causally related to the offence. I was mindful that there was no indication of her suffering from depression throughout the trial and the defence was centred on her chronic headaches.

98     I agreed with the Prosecution’s submissions and placed no weight on Dr Ung’s 8 November 2019 report as it was clear that his opinion is predicated on truthfulness of the information provided by the accused and it was evident that the accused had lied to him. Dr Ung was not called as a defence witness and his opinion was not subject to any cross-examination by the Prosecution. Instead, his report was included as part of the Defence’s Closing Submissions even before I had made my finding on the charge.

### Conclusion

99     In my consideration of the appropriate sentence, I took into account that she was a first offender who was convicted of possessing a small amount of methamphetamine _ie_ not less than 0.29 gram at the end of trial and had demonstrated a lack of remorse throughout the trial.

100    All things considered, I was of the view that a sentence of nine months’ imprisonment was just and appropriate in the circumstances. This is an uplift of the sentence of eight months’ imprisonment that was imposed in both _Dinesh Singh_ and _Alvin Lim_ who had pleaded guilty to their respective charges.
