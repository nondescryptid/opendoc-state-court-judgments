### District Judge Carol Ling Feng Yong:

## Charge

The Accused, a Singaporean male aged 62, claimed trial to a single charge of driving without reasonable consideration under section 65(b) of the Road Traffic Act. The charge reads:

_“You… are charged that you, on 9 October 2017 at or about 12:25 pm, along Bukit Timah Road slip road into Dunearn Road (Bukit Timah Road u-turn into Dunearn Road), Singapore, did drive motor van PA 5098R without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road, to wit, by failing to give way to a vehicle with the right of way when making the u-turn, in the process, cutting into the path of the unknown motor vehicle, resulting in the said vehicle to apply brakes in order to avoid a near collision with your vehicle, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 65(b) of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276._

2       At the conclusion of the trial, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him on the charge. He was fined a sum of $800 which he duly paid. The Accused has appealed against both conviction and sentence.

## Undisputed Facts

3       It was undisputed that the Accused was the driver of a motor van PA 5098R (hereafter “Accused’s van”) at the material time. The Accused did not dispute the fact that on the day in question, he was travelling along Bukit Timah Road when he made the u-turn into Dunearn Road.

4       The issue before the court was whether the Accused had made the u-turn without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road, in this case, for failing to give way to vehicles with the right of way when making the u-turn and in the process, cutting into the path of an unknown vehicle, causing the vehicle to apply brakes in order to avoid a near collision with his van.

## Prosecution’s Case

5       The Prosecution’s case was made of these essential pieces of evidence:

a)     The testimonies of PW1 SSgt Syafa’at Bin Abdul Rahman and PW2 Nur Sabrina Bte Mustaffa;

b)     A video footage (marked and admitted as P3)

#### Evidence of PW1 SSgt Syafa’at Bin Abdul Rahman

6       On 9 October 2017, PW1 was performing covert duty in an unmarked police vehicle. According to PW1, an unmarked police vehicle looked like any normal vehicle on the road. He was on duty with a partner, PW2 Nur Sabrina Bte Mustaffa, and was driving the unmarked police vehicle.

7       As he was travelling along the Pan Island Expressway (PIE) towards Changi, he saw the Accused’s van cross a double white line. He then informed his partner that he was going to stop the driver. PW1 drove up the left side of the Accused’s van, placed the blinker on his vehicle and pointed for the Accused to stop. However, the Accused did not look at PW1 and proceeded straight. PW1 then had to go behind the Accused’s van, exited at Eng Neo Avenue as he did, and followed the Accused’s van all the way into the vicinity of Vanda Link. The Accused did not stop his van at any time[^1].

8       As the Accused drove out of the vicinity of Vanda Link into Dunearn Road, PW1’s evidence was that the Accused begin making a series of u-turns between Dunearn Road and Bukit Timah Road. In one of the u-turns, PW1 whose vehicle was right behind the Accused’s van, observed that the Accused, in making that fast u-turn, encroached into the path of an unknown vehicle who was travelling on the extreme right lane of a three-lane road, causing the unknown vehicle to almost come to a complete stop. PW1 also believed that the driver of the unknown vehicle had honked at the Accused[^2].

9       Commenting on the relevant portion of the footage shown to him[^3], PW1 elaborated to say that at that particular u-turn, the Accused had stopped his van because there was a vehicle in front of him. Once that vehicle turned out, so did the Accused. When the Accused did that, the vehicle which was on the right lane of a three-lane road _“made an abrupt stop….almost came to a complete stop[^4]”_, before moving off. In cross-examination, PW1 stated that the vehicle behind the Accused’s van actually “_jammed brake almost to a stop_” which is why the driver managed to avoid a collision. The vehicle was one-car length away from the Accused’s vehicle when the latter made the u-turn[^5].

10     After the Accused made the u-turn, PW1 continued following the Accused’s van. Shortly, PW1’s colleagues in police vehicles arrived in the vicinity. A police vehicle with blinkers on, stopped in front of the Accused’s van, hence “sandwiching” the Accused’s van with PW1’s vehicle. The Accused’s van had to come to a stop[^6]. After what appeared to be a confrontation between the Accused and the police officers at the scene, the Accused’s particulars were taken down. (It would be appropriate for me to add at this stage that the Prosecution did not deem it necessary to lead detailed evidence relating to the police officers’ engagement with the Accused at the scene after his van was stopped as the facts were not relevant to the offence in question. I was in agreement with that approach).

11     PW1 documented this incident in his patrol log sheet (Exhibit P2) and subsequently put up the Report of a Traffic Offence (Exhibit P1). The details in the patrol log sheet were consistent with PW1’s testimony[^7].

#### Evidence of PW2 Nur Sabrina Binte Mustaffa

12     PW2 is an AETOS officer attached to the Transport Enforcement Department, AETOS. At the material time, she was assigned to covert operation duty with PW1.

13     On the day in question, she first noticed the Accused’s van travelling at high speed along the PIE towards Changi. As they followed the Accused’s van, she observed that the van changed lanes and crossed double white lines. As requested by her partner, she put on the blinkers and their vehicle drove up alongside the left of the van. PW2 testified that despite honking, the Accused did not turn to look at them. Subsequently, they drove to the right side of the van which was closer to the Accused in his driver’s seat, and PW2 waved her traffic wand at him. However, the Accused refused to turn to look at them and continued driving. PW2 testified that she could not remember how many times their vehicle had come beside the Accused’s van but the Accused refused to look at them or acknowledge them. It was then PW1 decided to call for back-up[^8].

14     It was her evidence that her partner continued honking at the Accused as their vehicle eventually followed the Accused’s van into Eng Neo Avenue. The Accused’s van then drove into a private housing estate and because it comprised of one-lane roads, their vehicle could not “_get side-by-side_” with the van[^9]. When the Accused’s van made its way into Dunearn Road, PW2 testified that she was surprised when the Accused begin making many u-turns between Dunearn Road and Bukit Timah Road.

15     The Accused eventually came to a stop when other police vehicles arrived in the vicinity and the Accused’s van was prevented from moving off by a police vehicle blocking his path of travel. At this juncture, PW2 similarly alluded to a confrontation between the Accused and police officers at the scene[^10]. However, in respect of the particular u-turn which the Accused had made (which formed the basis of the charge), PW2 was not able to testify as to how the Accused had made the u-turn that day, stating that she could “_not see whether the road is clear_”[^11]. Other than the offence of the Accused’s van crossing the double white lines, PW2 stated that she did not observe any other traffic violations.

16     PW2 testified that as one of the requirements of Traffic Police, she had with her a Sony video camera which was switched on throughout her duty that day. PW2 was in the front seat of a covert patrol vehicle which was travelling behind the Accused’s van for a large part of the journey. Given its position, the video camera effectively captured what happened that day.

#### Video footage

17     The video footage from the Sony video camera, tendered in court as exhibit P3, was about 18 minutes long. It showed the Accused’s van travelling along the expressway and eventually exiting the PIE at the Eng Neo exit to the vicinity of Dunearn Road/Bukit Timah Road.

18     From time-stamp 0:05:30, the Accused’s van was seen crossing the double white lines along the expressway. Thereafter, the patrol vehicle driven by PW1 and PW2 was seen driving alongside the Accused’s van on its left. Simultaneously, honking sounds were heard. The Accused’s van was seen driving ahead. The patrol car subsequently came alongside the right of the Accused’s van but the Accused’s van pulled ahead. The patrol car continued to trail the Accused’s van and honking sounds could be heard on the footage. Shortly, the patrol car once again came alongside the Accused’s van, this time on its right, with honking sounds. At this juncture, the Accused’s van exited the PIE through Eng Neo Avenue. The patrol car continued to follow the Accused’s van upon its exit from PIE into and through a private housing estate, honking loudly several times. The Accused’s van was observed driving on without stopping, not even at stop lines within the private housing estate.

19     At about time stamp 0:15:35, the Accused’s van drove into Dunearn Road. Subsequently, the Accused made a u-turn into Bukit Timah Road. Honking sounds could be heard as the patrol car trailed closely behind. Shortly, the Accused made a u-turn back onto Dunearn Road and pulled ahead. Driving on, the Accused made another u-turn onto Bukit Timah Road. He attempted to filter into the left lane but was not able to do so. Eventually, at time stamp 0:18:29, the Accused’s van was forced to come to a stop when a police car stopped in front of him.

20     The pertinent footage that formed a crucial part of the Prosecution’s evidence against the Accused ran from time-stamp 0:17:01 to 0:17:35. It showed the Accused’s van along Bukit Timah Road, turning into the slip road to make the u-turn onto Dunearn Road. I make the following observations upon viewing this portion of the footage:

a)     As the Accused’s van was waiting to make the u-turn, one could see bright flashes reflected at the rear of the Accused’s van. This indicated that the blinkers on the patrol car, which was right behind the Accused’s van, were on, as testified to by PW1 and PW2;

b)     There was a steady flow of traffic along Dunearn Road as the Accused was waiting for his turn to make the u-turn;

c)     After the Accused executed the u-turn into Dunearn Road, a blue vehicle (in footage: one SLQ 9758G) was seen coming closely behind the Accused’s van, honking;

d)     The brake lights on the blue vehicle were lit up[^12].

## Assessing the Prosecution’s Evidence

21     I accept the evidence presented by the Prosecution.

22     I found both PW1 and PW2 to be credible witnesses. Both of them did not know the Accused prior to the incident. They gave a clear and coherent description of the events that happened that day. Their accounts were consistent with each other in respect of how they had observed the manner of driving by the Accused. When they failed to get the Accused’s attention as they drove alongside him, both the witnesses testified that they tailed the Accused’s van closely, with lighted blinkers placed on their covert patrol vehicle. In the course of following the Accused, they both gave evidence that they had persistently honked at the Accused in their bid to get him to stop. However, their efforts were to no avail as the Accused continued driving. Their description of the events was well-corroborated by contemporaneous entries in the patrol log sheet (Exhibit P2) and the footage captured on the Sony video camera PW2 had on her.

23     Whilst I recognize that the above peripheral evidence do not establish the charge against the Accused, they formed the context in which the Accused’s offence of inconsiderate driving was committed. The Accused was observed driving at a fast speed through a private housing state before turning into Dunearn Road/Bukit Timah Road and making a series of, what appeared to be meaningless, u-turns. However, when the Accused’s driving pattern is considered in the context of the evidence of PW1 and PW2, a reasonable inference may be drawn that Accused was attempting to shake the covert patrol vehicle “off his tail” and that he had also made the u-turn hastily in his bid to do so.

24     In this regard, the Accused’s manner of driving when making the u-turn was personally witnessed by PW1. PW1 was driving the patrol vehicle and was right behind the Accused’s van. He had a clear view of the Accused’s van. He had observed that the Accused, in making that fast u-turn, encroached into the path of an unknown vehicle who was travelling on the extreme right lane of a three-lane road, causing the unknown vehicle to almost come to a complete stop. Given the position of PW1’s vehicle viz-a-viz the Accused’s van and PW1 as the driver of the patrol vehicle, it was not probable that PW1 could have made a mistake in his observation.

25     Importantly, the direct testimony of PW1 is corroborated by incontrovertible evidence in the form of the video footage (P3). The relevant portions of the video footage showed the Accused’s vehicle waiting to make a u-turn in the face of a steady flow of traffic along Dunearn Road. Shortly, after the Accused executed the u-turn into Dunearn Road, a blue vehicle (in footage: one SLQ 9758G) was seen coming closely behind the Accused’ van, honking and the brake lights on the blue vehicle were lit up. There can be no suggestion that the video footage was inaccurate in any way.

26     In totality, the act of the Accused in making that u-turn into Dunearn Road was witnessed by a police officer who had his eyes trained on the Accused’s van; it was also well-caught on a video camera. Having considered the testimonies of the Prosecution witnesses and watched the video footage several times, I was satisfied that the Accused had made the u-turn into Dunearn Road in that manner at the material time.

#### Accused had driven inconsiderately

27     The Accused had driven his van without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road, by making the u-turn in the manner that he did.

28     It did not matter that there was no collision between the Accused’s van and the unknown vehicle. It cannot be disputed that the Accused did not have a right of way in this situation. He had to give way to the other vehicles driving along Dunearn Road and he could only make a u-turn when traffic was clear and/or it was sufficiently safe for him to do so. However, from the testimony of PW1 and the objective evidence captured on the video footage, the unknown vehicle coming along Dunearn Road was heard honking and the brake lights of the vehicle were seen lit up as the Accused’s van cut into its lane. It is apparent that the driver of the unknown vehicle had to honk to alert the Accused of danger and also had to brake in order to avoid a collision with the Accused’s van. These were clear indications that the Accused had failed to give way to the vehicle who was approaching, when he ought to have done so. In so doing, the Accused had not shown reasonable consideration for a fellow motorist.

## The Defence Case

29     The Accused chose to give evidence when his defence was called.

30     The Accused drives a private van for a living. He testified that as he was driving from Jurong West to Bukit Timah that day in question, he spotted a “_private car_” following him. He attempted to slow down along certain parts of the journey hoping that the “_private car_” will come on his right side so that he may have a clear view of who was following him. However, that did not happen.

31     The Accused stated that he almost came to a stop before entering Eng Neo Avenue to allow the private car to come beside him but the car did not do so. The Accused testified that he was worried and thought that the driver might “_harm_” and “_rob_” him and planned to drive to the nearest police station. However, subsequently when the Accused stopped at a traffic light, he was asked to alight from his van by “_one gentleman_”. The Accused then proceeded to describe in great detail how he was handcuffed and placed under arrest[^13].

32     When his attention was re-directed to the alleged offence of making the u-turn without reasonable consideration for other road users, the Accused testified that there was a red light (for approaching vehicles) when he made the u-turn. He disputed the fact that any vehicle coming from behind him had to brake. He added that he had waited for quite some time before he turned into Dunearn Road. He asserted that if he had in fact turned out suddenly, there would have been an accident[^14]. The Accused stated that when he made the u-turn, there was no car coming from his left[^15] and maintained that the traffic was clear when he turned out. The Accused denied hearing any horn sounding after he made the u-turn[^16].

33     The Accused stated that he was unaware that it was the police that was following him. No police uniforms were worn by the person in the vehicle[^17]; he did not notice a blinker placed on the top of the vehicle following closely behind him or hear any horn[^18], that was why he did not stop his van. He explained that he circled Dunearn Road and Bukit Timah Road twice because he had to “_practise_”; he had to familiarise himself with the roads as he would have to fetch workers on the route[^19].

#### No reasonable doubt

34     The Accused’s evidence did not cast any reasonable doubt on the Prosecution’s case.

35     In the first place, his claim that he had slowed down and stopped at Eng Neo exit to allow the vehicle to come beside him is not borne out in the video footage at all. His assertions that he did not notice the blinkers on and did not hear any horn from the vehicle behind him must similarly be rejected in light of the video footage. It could be seen very clearly from the video footage that the blinkers of the covert patrol vehicle behind the Accused’s van were flashing brightly; the persistent and loud honking from the patrol vehicle could also be heard very plainly in and at several portions of the video footage. It was not possible that the Accused had missed seeing the blinkers or hearing the horn. Looking at the speed at which the Accused’s van was travelling as he drove through the private estate, it appeared more likely that he did not want to stop. In light of the objective evidence, I did not find the Accused to be a credible and truthful witness.

36     The Accused’s claim that he was worried and thought that he might be harmed or robbed by the vehicle behind is contradicted by his own actions. If he had truly felt that way, he would have driven himself straight to any police station to seek help, as opposed to driving through a private estate and in circles along Dunearn Road and Bukit Timah Road, to supposedly familiarise himself with his driving routes for work purposes. Logically, that would have been the last thing on the mind of a person fearing hurt and harm.

37     Most importantly, the Accused’s assertion that he had made the u-turn when the traffic was clear is refuted by the evidence contained in the video footage. A vehicle did come behind the Accused’s van after he made the u-turn, with brakes light on and horn sounding.

## Court’s Decision to Convict

38     At the conclusion of the trial, I was satisfied that the charge had been proven against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I convicted the Accused on the charge.

## Sentence

39     I fined the Accused a sum of $800, in default 4 days’ imprisonment.

40     As this was the Accused’s first conviction under section 65(b) of the Road Traffic Act, the maximum fine prescribed was $1,000. Although he had a few traffic-related and speeding offences, those were compounded. This was the Accused’s first court conviction.

41     In this case, the Accused claimed trial. In mitigation, he maintained his innocence and continued to express his grievance about being handcuffed on the day of the offence. Even after all the evidence relating to the offence had been laid out, he refused to acknowledge how his manner of driving had been inconsiderate towards other road-users. The Accused had no insight into his own conduct and was clearly unremorseful, choosing instead to focus on the conduct of other police officers who arrived at the scene subsequently. I did not find any mitigating factors in favour of the Accused.

42     I was of the view that a sufficiently high fine would be appropriate in the circumstances of the case and hence, I imposed a sum of $800.

43     The Prosecutor sought a term of disqualification but other than informing me that he had instructions from the Attorney-General’s Chambers to ask for a disqualification, no further reasons were articulated as to why a disqualification was warranted. I did not consider a disqualification necessary, given the nature of the violation. There was no accident caused due to the Accused’s moment of inconsiderate driving (although this would rightly be attributed to the quick reaction of the driver of the unknown vehicle rather than any act of the Accused). Outcomes do matter and I took that into consideration in declining to impose a disqualification.
