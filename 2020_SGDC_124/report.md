### District Judge Shaiffudin Bin Saruwan:

## INTRODUCTION

This is an appeal against conviction and sentence lodged by the two accused persons, namely, Malkar Savlaram Anant (“Malkar”) and his wife Bhattacharya Priyanka Rajesh (“Priyanka”).

2       The offences committed by the accused persons involved offences of trafficking in persons under the Prevention of Human Trafficking Act 2014 (“PHTA”) and the Women’s Charter, Cap 353 (“WC”).

3       The accused persons had jointly managed the premises named Kanggan and Kickk, two seemingly legitimate Hindi entertainment clubs. The clubs had employed performing artists (“PA”) from Bangladesh. The primary task of the PAs was to dance and entertain the clubs’ patrons, and in the process to entice the patrons into tipping them generously. The tips collection constituted a significant portion of the clubs’ revenue; the other being the sale of alcoholic drinks. However, the veneer of legitimacy concealed a pattern of exploitation of the PAs. The accused persons had abused their power as employers by subjecting the PAs to verbal abuse, onerous financial penalties should they decide to terminate their contracts, close surveillance, and tight restrictions over their freedom of movement and communication.

4       Within the backdrop of the oppressive environment, the two accused persons had jointly coerced one of the PAs into providing sexual services to patrons of Kanggan to boost the club’s revenue. They deceived her into believing that she could retain half of the earnings. The constant badgering by the accused persons sapped her will to resist. She finally relented and went on to provide sexual services on four separate occasions.

## THE FACTS

### THE PARTIES

5       The accused persons were Indian nationals. Malkar was an S-Pass holder, and Priyanka was a dependent’s pass holder. As stated earlier, they were husband and wife.

6       The victims in relation to the trial were Victim 1 (“V1”), Victim 2 (“V2”) and Victim 3 (“V3”). They were female Bangladeshi nationals who had come to Singapore on work permits to work as PAs in Kanggan and Kickk.

### BACKGROUND FACTS

7       Kanggan was located at 82, Boat Quay #01-01. Kickk was only a stone’s throw away at 32, Circular Road #01-00. Their daily operational hours was 9.00 pm to 6.00 am. They were sole-proprietorships under the name of one Rakesh Belani s/o Ishuwar Dass (“Rakesh”). He was the main investor but he was not involved in the day-to-day operations of the clubs.

8       Malkar was the sole managing operator of Kanggan. He was responsible for managing its day-to-day operations. This included recruiting PAs with the help of employment agents, and paying their salaries. He also gave instructions to the PAs. Apart from his duties at Kanggan, he was responsible for the recruitment of the PAs in Kickk.

9       Priyanka had assisted Malkar in his management duties at Kanggan. Specifically, she had the overall supervision of the PAs. In fact, the PAs had all regarded her as the ‘manager’ at Kanggan.

10     Malkar had engaged agents in Bangladesh and India to recruit PA from these two countries. Subsequent to the selection process, he would inform Rakesh to make the necessary work pass applications for the PAs to be employed in the two clubs.

11     At the point of recruitment, the PAs was promised a salary of 60,000 Bangladeshi taka (“taka”); which was the equivalent of about S$982. Food and lodgings were provided. They were housed at Block 101, Kitchener Road #XXX, Jalan Besar Plaza (“the Apartment”). They were ferried to and from the apartment and the clubs in a mini bus provided by the clubs. Other than the PAs, both the accused persons and the clubs’ disc jockeys (“DJ”) also stayed at the Apartment.

12     The clubs’ main source of revenue came from the alcoholic drinks and the PAs. The PAs generated income for the clubs through tips that they received from the clubs’ patrons or customers. The tips were deposited inside a collection box, which was located near the stage. The box comprised a long rectangular box divided into smaller compartments. Each compartment bore the name of a PA , and every PA deposited her tips into the compartment that bore her name. The collections were counted at the end of each business day, and the amounts recorded against each PA’s name in a ledger. In theory, the collections were to be distributed to the PAs. The records were also a way for the accused persons to keep tabs on the PAs’ individual work performances i.e., whether they achieved their monthly revenue target.

### A SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES’ CASES

13     The prosecution’s case were as pleaded in the proceeded charges against the accused persons -

14     The defence denied procuring V2 to provide sexual services to the patrons of the club, and that they had lived in part on the earnings obtained from such services. They averred that none of the PAs had provided any sexual services to the club’s patrons. They also asserted that they had not abused their power over the PAs. Their freedom of movement and communication were not restricted in any manner or form.

### THE COURT’S DECISION

15     At the conclusion of the trial, I found the two accused persons guilty on all the proceeded charges, and I duly convicted them of the charges. Malkar then consented to have 12 other charges against him taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. The charges comprised –

> (a)     Two charges of living in part on the earnings of prostitution under s 146(1) WC;

> (b)     One charge of managing the club Kickk which was used as a place of assignation under s 147(2) WC;

> (c)     One charge of attempting to procure a female Bangladeshi national for the purposes of prostitution within Singapore under s 140(1)(b) r/w s 140(1)(j) WC; and,

> (d)     Eight charges of human trafficking with common intention under s 3(1) PHTA r/w s 34 PC.

16     Malkar was granted a discharge amounting to acquittal on three charges pursuant to the prosecution’s application to withdraw them –

> (a)     One charge of abetting Priyanka in an attempt to procure a female Bangladeshi national for the purposes of prostitution within Singapore under s 140(1)(b) read with s140(1)(j) WC read with s 109 PC, and,

> (b)     Two charges of abetting Priyanka to procure two female Bangladeshi nationals for the purposes of prostitution within Singapore under s 140(1)(b) WC read with s 109 PC.

### THE SENTENCE

17     Both accused persons were first offenders. After hearing the sentencing submissions and the plea in mitigation, I imposed the following sentences –

18     In relation to Priyanka, I ordered the imprisonment sentences in DAC 942254/16 and DAC 947910/16 to run consecutively, making the total aggregate sentence five years’ and six months’ imprisonment, and fine $7,500 in default six weeks’ imprisonment.

19     In relation to Malkar, I ordered the imprisonment sentences in DAC 942261/16 and DAC 947921/16 to run consecutively, making the total aggregate sentence five years’ and six months’ imprisonment, and fine $7,500 in default six weeks’ imprisonment. I also made a compensation order against him pursuant to s 359 of the Criminal Procedure Code, Cap 68 (“CPC”), to pay S$4,878.31 in default two weeks’ imprisonment. The amount was for the non-payment of salary to V2.

## CONSENT OF THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR (“PP’S CONSENT)

### DOES OMISSION TO TENDER PP’S CONSENT INVALIDATE TRIAL?

20     A PP’s Consent was required in order to initiate prosecution of offences under both PHTA and WC. In relation to the WC offences, the prosecution had tendered the PP’s Consent under s 154(2) WC at the start of the proceedings. However, the PP’s Consent in relation to the PHTA offences were only tendered sometime in October 2018, mid-way through the trial.

### The Defence’s Arguments

21     The defence pointed out that s 22 PHTA provided that a prosecution under the Act shall not be instituted except by or with the PP’s Consent. They argued that the omission to tender the PP’s Consent at the start of the proceedings rendered the entire proceedings invalid because -

> (a)     The clear wordings in s 22 PHTA rendered the PP’s Consent mandatory. This was so because a PP’s Consent required a full consideration of the relevant facts and evidence of the case. It was “_an act of reason, accompanied with deliberation, the mind weighing, as in balance, the good and evil on each_ side”: _Abdul Hamid v Public Prosecutor[^1]_. Although not expressly averred, what I think the defence meant was that it served as a check on capricious or arbitrary prosecution. It ensured that the prosecutorial discretion was exercised judiciously.

> (b)     The CPC provided that an accused person may, _inter alia_, be charged or arrested, or remanded in custody or released on bail, notwithstanding that the PP’s Consent has not been obtained, but the case shall not be further prosecuted until that consent has been obtained: s 10(2). And s 10(3). Provided that when an accused person was brought to court before the PP’s Consent was obtained, the charge shall be explained to him but he shall not be called upon to plead. Reading them conjunctively, these two CPC provisions clearly prescribed that that there should be no further prosecution of the accused person without the PP’s Consent.

> (c)     Therefore, the two accused persons should be granted a discharge not amounting to acquittal, citing in support _Public Prosecutor v Nagalingam Mathiyooke and another_[^2] (“_Nagalingam_”). _Nagalingam_ involved offences under the Prevention of Corruption Ordinance No. 39 of 1960 (“PCO”). A PP’s Consent was required under s 31 of the Ordinance. The district court found that the prosecution had not sufficiently complied with s 31. It granted the accused person a discharge not amounting to an acquittal. The decision was affirmed by the High Court.

### The Prosecution’s Arguments

22     The prosecution accepted that they had not complied with s 22 PHTA. But the omission amounted only to a procedural irregularity. It did not render the proceedings invalid, citing s 423 CPC in support. s 423 CPC provided –

> _“423_.     _Subject to this Code, any judgment, sentence or order passed or made by a court of competent jurisdiction may not be reversed or altered on account of –_

>> _…_

>> (_b_)     _the lack of any consent of the Public Prosecutor as required by law;_

>> _…_

> _unless the error, omission, improper admission or rejection of evidence, irregularity or lack of consent has caused a failure of justice.”_

23     The prosecution pointed out that the present court was a court of competent jurisdiction by virtue of s 23(1) PHTA, which conferred the district court with the jurisdiction to try any offence under PHTA. As such, the lack of a PP’s Consent would not invalidate the proceedings unless a failure of justice had been caused. They pointed out that the lack of a PP’s Consent was a distinct and separate issue from the question of whether the present court was a court of competent jurisdiction. Their reasoning was that if the lack of a PP’s Consent meant that an otherwise competent court was _ipso facto_ not a court of competent jurisdiction, it would render s 423(b) otiose as it would be difficult to envisage a situation in which s 423(b) would ever apply.

24     The prosecution relied on the Indian Supreme Court case in _State of Madhya Pradesh v Bhooraji and Ors_[^3] (“_Bhooraji_”) to support their arguments. The Indian Supreme Court held that _–_

> _“\[t\]he expression “a court of competent jurisdiction” … is to denote a validly constituted court conferred with the jurisdiction to try the offence or offences. Such a court will not get denuded of its competence to try the case on account of any procedural lapse and the competence would remain unaffected by non-compliance of the procedural requirement”._ It went on further to say that “_\[t\]he bar against taking cognizance of certain offences or by certain courts cannot govern the question whether the Court concerned is “a Court of competent jurisdiction”, e.g. Courts are debarred from taking cognizance of certain offences without sanction of certain authorities_”.

25     In the present case, the prosecution submitted that the lack of a PP’s Consent did not cause a failure of justice. The accused persons had not been misled or prejudiced in any manner in the conduct of their defence. They had full opportunity to prepare for and conduct their defence. They had cross-examined every prosecution witnesses, and had the opportunity to call their own witnesses to testify on their behalf.

26     Lastly, they argued that the reliance on _Nagalingam_ was misplaced. This was because the equivalent provision in the CPC (Cap 132, 1955 Edition (1969 Reprint))(“1969 Reprint”) that was in force when Nagalingam was decided did not cover irregularities in relation to a PP’s Consent required under the PCO. That was the very issue that was up for determination in _Nagalingam_. The relevant provision then was –

> _“440_.     _Subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained no finding, sentence or order passed or made by a court of competent jurisdiction shall be reversed or altered on account of –_

>> _…_

>> _(b) the want of any sanction required by section 128_,

>> _…_

> _unless such error, omission, improper admission or rejection of evidence, irregularity, or want has occasioned a failure of justice_.”

27     As s 440 above applied only in relation to consents required by s 128 of the 1969 Reprint, and did not extend to consents required under other statutes such as the PCO, it could not be relied on in _Nagalingam_. The prosecution also highlighted that s 440(b) of the 1969 Reprint was eventually amended to expand its scope to include consents “_as required under the law_”.

### The Court’s Ruling

28     Although I agreed with the defence’s submission that a PP’s Consent was mandatory for the institution of proceedings under PHTA, I found that an omission to do so did not invalidate the proceedings. My conclusion was based on the wordings of s 423 CPC. It expressly stated that the lack of a PP’s Consent could be rectified if the conditions set out in the section were satisfied. I found that 10 CPC did not help the defence’s case. That provision did not expressly provide that the proceedings was rendered invalid for lack of a PP’s Consent. In fact, reading both s 10(2) and s 10(3) I drew the inference that the lack of a PP’s Consent was a procedural irregularity that could be rectified.

29     My court was a court of competent jurisdiction ie, a validly constituted court by virtue of s 23(1) PHTA conferred with the jurisdiction to try all offences under PHTA, notwithstanding the lack of a PP’s Consent. I was also satisfied that no failure of justice was occasioned by the lack of a PP’s Consent. The two accused persons had not been misled for want of a PP’s Consent. They always knew what the specific allegations against them were. They had all the opportunity to cross-examine the prosecution witnesses, and they had done so extensively in the course of the trial. They had also called their own witnesses. Significantly, I noted that the defence had not pleaded that a failure of justice had been caused.

30     Lastly, I agreed with the prosecution’s arguments (at \[26\] and \[27\]) that _Nagalingam_ was distinguishable, and as such had no bearing on the issue before me.

31     In conclusion, I ruled that the procedural irregularity in tendering the PP’s Consent mid-trial did not render the proceedings, including my verdict and sentences, invalid.

32     Having addressed that particular issue, I would now proceed to discuss the reasons why I convicted the accused persons, and the sentences that I imposed.

## THE CONVICTION

### CREDIBILITY OF WITNESSES – APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES

33     The whole case ultimately revolved around the question of the witnesses’ credibility. In this regard, I was mindful of the principles relating to the assessment of the credibility of witnesses set out in _Farida Begum d/o Mohd Artham v PP[^4]_ (“_Farida Begum_”). In _Farida Begum_, Yong Pung How CJ held that in determining the credibility of a witness, the trial court must consider the following three factors (at \[9\] of the judgment) –

> (a)     Demeanour;

> (b)     Internal consistency (or lack thereof) in the content of the witness’s evidence; and

> (c)     External consistency (or lack thereof) between the contents of the witness’s evidence and the available extrinsic evidence.

34     I was also mindful of the observations in _Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v PP[^5]_, where the High Court held (at \[40\] of the judgment) that the real test was how consistent the story was within itself, how it stood the test of cross-examination and how it fit in with the rest of the evidence, and the circumstances of the case.

### THE TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS (“PHTA”) CHARGES

### The Prosecutions’s Case

35     The prosecution proceeded on s 3(1) PHTA against both accused persons. The relevant excerpt of s 3(1) PHTA is set out below for easy reference –

> **“3**.     _(1) Any person who … harbours … an individual (other than a child) by means of –_

>> (_a_)     _…;_

>> (_b_)     _…;_

>> (_c_)     _…;_

>> (_d_)     _the abuse of power;_

>> (_e_)     _…; or_

>> (_f_)     _…_

> _for the purpose of the exploitation (whether in Singapore or elsewhere) of the individual shall be guilty of an offence.”_

36     The allegations against the two accused persons were that they had harboured the victims by means of abuse of power for the purpose of exploitation in Singapore. The exploitation relied on was ‘servitude’.

37     Exploitation was defined in s 2 PHTA as “sexual exploitation, forced labour, slavery or any practice similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of an organ”. Servitude was defined in the same section as “_… in relation to any individual, means any condition or obligation, not authorised by any written law, to work, or render services from which the individual cannot escape or which the individual is not free to change_”.

38     The victims of these offences were poor. They had little education. They had taken the job in Singapore to earn a better living for themselves and their families. When they arrived in Singapore, they were made to sign employment contracts in English. They did not understand English and the contents had not been read and explained to them. The contracts contained a clause which obliged them to pay an exorbitant financial penalty to release themselves from the contract. This penalty clause meant that the victims were irretrievably bound to their contracts until the end.

39     The prosecution contended that the victims were entirely at the mercy of the accused persons. They were subjected to close surveillance at the Apartment and at the clubs. Their movements, communications with the outside world and their living arrangements were tightly controlled. They could not do anything except with the permission of the accused persons. Their personal mobile phones and passports were confiscated by the accused persons when they arrived at the Apartment. The imbalance of power that was heavily skewed in favour of the accused persons was painfully obvious.

40     The prosecution argued that many of the obligations imposed by the accused persons on the victims were illegal. These included –

> (a)     They worked every day without any day off for the entire period of their employment. This was contrary to s 53(1) read with s 36(1) of the Employment Act (Cap 91, 2009 Rev Ed)(“EA”).

> (b)     The victims’ work permits were withheld from them. This was in breach of s 13 of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Cap 91A, 2009 Rev Ed)(“EFMA”). This provision mandated that the work permits must be in the possession of the work pass holders, and prohibited any other person from having possession of the work passes.

> (c)     The victims’ passports were confiscated in contravention of s 47(5) of the Passports Act (Cap 220, 2008 Rev Ed).

> (d)     The victims V1 and V2 had their salaries withheld for more than a month after they had started work, which was in contravention of s 21(1) EA.

41     The prosecution submitted that the three elements of s 3(1) PHTA were satisfied –

> (a)      Harbouring: The two accused persons had, by housing the victims at the Apartment and providing food to them for the duration of their contract of employment, had harboured the victims.

> (b)      Abuse of power: The accused persons was in an overwhelming position of power over the victims. They had abused that power by subjecting the victims to oppressive work conditions, verbal abuse, onerous financial penalties should they wish to terminate their contracts early and close surveillance and tight control over the victims’ movements and communications.

> (c)      Exploitation i.e., servitude: The conditions and/or obligations imposed on the victims were not specifically permitted by law. The victims were also not in any position to escape them given the tight control over their movements and the withholding of their passports and work permits. They were unable to extricate themselves from their situation by terminating their contracts because of the onerous financial penalty they had to pay.

### The Defence’s Case

42     The defence was one of denial. They claimed that the victims were free to leave the Apartment whenever they liked. The main door of the Apartment was never locked, and the keys were always placed on the table at the living room. They also denied any knowledge of the employment contracts that the victims had signed. Lastly, they denied that they had confiscated the victims’ passports and mobile phones, or withheld their work permits.

### Analysis of the Evidence

43     I set out my analysis of the evidence adduced in relation to the three elements of s 3(1) PHTA above, and bearing in mind the principles on witnesses’ credibility that had been set out earlier.

## (1)   Harbour

44     The word “_harbour_” was not defined in the PHTA. However some guidance could be obtained from the definition in the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 2008 Rev Ed)(“IA”). In that Act, “_harbour_” was defined as “_to give food or shelter, and included the act of assisting a person in any way to evade apprehension_”. I applied this definition to the present case as the act of harbouring envisaged in the IA was markedly similar to that in the PHTA.

45     The evidence before me showed that the victims had been harboured in the Apartment. The Statement of Agreed Facts (“ASOF”)[^6] stated that the victims were all housed at the Apartment upon their arrival in Singapore. They were given two meals a day during their stay there.

46     The ASOF also stated that the accused persons were in charge of the accommodation. In addition, there was other evidence that confirmed this. In one of her police statements, Priyanka had described what she and Malkar had done when a new PA arrived at the Apartment. The relevant portion of the police statement was as follow –

> “7    … When I first started to help “Johnny” \[Malkar\] at ‘Kanggan’ pub, ‘Johnny’ was the one who taught me what to do. He told me the performing artiste \[_sic_\] have already taken their one month advance salary when they first came to Singapore.

> …

> I will have to ask the performing artiste to sign a payment voucher to indicate that they \[_sic_\] have received their \[_sic_\] salary. Whenever there is a new performing artiste coming to Singapore to work for either ‘Kanggan’ or ‘Khel’, her agent will informed ‘Johnny’ and ‘Johnny’ will inform a male Punjabi known as ‘Khera’ to picked her up at the airport … to bring the new performing artiste to the lodging place which is where we stayed as well…

> 8    When the new performing artiste arrived in Singapore and came over to our lodging place, I will then showed her around the house and her room. I will also asked \[_sic_\] her to sign the payment voucher as mentioned earlier. After which, I will introduce the new performing artiste to her roommates. If the performing artiste comes in the morning, I will give her some food and also tell her to rest till evening and to follow the other performing artiste to work. If the performing artiste comes at night, I will then allow her to rest and she will only work the following day…”[^7]

47     There was no doubt that Priyanka was actively involved with the PAs’ affairs both in the Apartment and at the clubs, and that both she and her husband were in charge. Her evidence showed that the accused persons had met the victims upon their arrival at the Apartment, given them instructions about the rules and regulations governing their stay at the Apartment, and the rules and regulations governing their work at the two clubs. This contradicted their testimonies in court where both of them asserted that she had no role at the club and that she had little or no interaction with the PAs.

48     Malkar’s claim that he was not in charge of the PAs at the Apartment, and that they did not need to take instructions from him, was ludicrous. Not only did it fly in the face of his wife’s statement to the police, it was also not consistent with the fact that he was their boss. It was painfully clear that he was trying to distance himself from the PAs by downplaying his role and involvement with the PAs.

49     I found that the accused persons had harboured the victims at the Apartment.

## (2)   Abuse of Power

50     The term “abuse of power” was not defined in the PHTA. Neither was it defined in the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons (“TIP Protocol”) which the PHTA was based on. In the absence of a definition, the prosecution submitted that it was reasonable to adopt a definition of “abuse of power” to include the power that employers have over their employees. In the context of trafficking of labour, the employer was almost invariably the party that wields the most power over the employees, especially when young, low educated and financially impoverished foreign workers were concerned. The defence did not offer any alternative definition of the phrase.

51     I accepted the prosecution’s definition. In my view, “abuse of power” referred to the act of using one’s position of power in an abusive way. This could take many forms, such as taking advantage of someone, abuse of authority, oppression, ill-treatment, and the causing of physical, mental and/or financial distress.

52     I also agreed with the prosecution that in this case the abuse of power were manifested under the following broad categories –

> (a)     Restrictions and constant supervision of movements;

> (b)     Confiscation of passports and work permits;

> (c)     Confiscation of mobile phones;

> (d)     Financial dependence;

> (e)     Difficult work conditions;

> (f)     Climate of fear; and

> (g)     Financial penalty to terminate contract.

#### (a)   Restrictions and constant supervision of movements

53     V1 was told by the accused persons that she was not allowed to leave the Apartment on her own. V1 said that the main door was always locked. She did not have the key to the main door. V1 also said that she had only left the Apartment on three occasions, and on those three occasions, she was accompanied either by Priyanka or the DJ[^8].

54     Similarly, V2 was told by Priyanka that she could not leave the Apartment on her own. V2 also said that the main door was always locked and that she did not have the key to the main door. Priyanka had also told her that she would be able to find out if anyone had gone out without her permission because there were CCTV cameras in the Apartment[^9].

55     V3 said she was not allowed to leave the Apartment on her own. She had asked to leave the Apartment once but the accused persons had told her that if she needed anything she was to tell them and they could get it for her. She also confirmed that the main door was locked when she was inside the Apartment. She did not have the key to the main door. She had only left the Apartment once to go for her medical examination. On this sole occasion, she was accompanied by the two DJs[^10].

56     I noted that Malkar, in rebutting the allegation that the victims did not have freedom of movement, had testified that the keys to the main door was always on the table in the living area. However, I found it significant that this very important piece of evidence was never put to the victims when they were on the stand. This strongly suggested that his evidence on this point was an after-thought.

57     Malkar had also testified that he was not aware of any rule that the PA must return to the Apartment from Kanggan in the mini van at the end of each work day. This claim was patently absurd. Malkar was the employer of the PA. He stayed at the Apartment with them, where he exercised supervision over them. The evidence suggested that he knew about the rule. In fact, it was reasonable to infer that the rule had been set by him.

#### (b)   Confiscation of passports and work permits

58     V1’s passport was confiscated by Priyanka. She was never given her work permit[^11]. V2 had given her passport to the man who had picked her up at the airport when he asked her for it. She also said that she was never given her work permit[^12]. V3’s passport was taken by the DJ who had then handed it to the two accused persons. It was never returned to her after that. Her work permit was never given to her[^13].

#### (c)   Confiscation of mobile phones

59     When she arrived at the Apartment, on Priyanka’s instructions, V1 had opened her luggage, taken out her mobile phone, and surrendered it to Priyanka. Priyanka had kept the mobile phone in a locker in her room. Priyanka had told her that this was done so that she could not use it to communicate with anyone. V1 had made numerous requests for its return but they were rejected. She was only allowed to speak to her family once a week for five minutes using a mobile phone provided by Priyanka. She had to do this in Priyanka’s presence. Priyanka had also told her that the mobile phone would record her conversations[^14].

60     V2’s mobile phone was confiscated by Priyanka on the day she arrived at the Apartment. She saw Priyanka going into her room with it[^15].

61     When Priyanka had asked her to hand over her mobile phone, V3 had tried to defer and said that she would give it to Priyanka later. Following this response, Priyanka had stressed to her that she was not allowed to use it. V3 did not ultimately hand her mobile phone to Priyanka. V3 could only call her family with Priyanka’s permission, and she had to use a mobile phone provided by Priyanka. She also had to speak to her family in Priyanka’s presence. V3 had only spoken to her family three times during her stay at the Apartment.[^16].

62     V2’s and V1’s evidence that their mobile phones had been confiscated were corroborated by the fact that when the police raided the Apartment, two bags containing some 10 mobile phones were seized from the accused persons’ bedroom. Amongst the mobile phones were those that belonged to V1 and V2[^17]. The seizure of the mobile phones by the police also flatly contradicted the accused persons’ evidence in court that V1 and V2 had possession of their mobile phones at all times.

#### (d)   Financial dependence

63     V1 did not have any cash with her when she arrived in Singapore. Although she had received an advance salary of 60,000 taka before she came, she did not bring any of it with her. She was not given her May 2016 salary until after police investigations had started. She was also not given any of the tips money that she had earned[^18].

64     V2 had 10,000 taka with her when she arrived in Singapore. The amount was confiscated by Priyanka, together with her passport and mobile phone. V2 had worked at the club from 22 Dec 15 to 21 May 16, but she had not received any salary. She had not received any of the tips money that she had earned from dancing at the club. The earnings that she had received for providing sexual services had also been confiscated by Priyanka[^19].

65     V3 came to Singapore with only 500 taka. She had received an advance salary of 60,000 taka when she was in Bangladesh. Like the other two, V3 did not receive any of the tips money that she had earned[^20].

#### (e)   Difficult work conditions

66     V1 worked seven days a week since she arrived. She was not told that there was no day off when she was recruited for the job in Bangladesh. In Singapore, Priyanka had told her that she had to work even if she was sick or feeling unwell[^21]. V2’s[^22] and V3’s testimonies mirrored that of V1. They worked every day without any day off. V3 recounted an incident when she was unwell but still had to go to the club. At the club, she was given one to two hours to rest but after that she had to perform with the other PAs[^23].

67     The victims’ evidence was consistent with the ASOF, wherein the defence had conceded that the PAs did not get any day off. Having taken that position, it was inexplicable for Malkar to testify that the PA were given a day off each week, but they had chosen not to take them. This was a significant shift in the defence’s position. It demonstrated the extent to which the accused persons would tailor evidence in order to extricate themselves from the charges.

#### (f)   Climate of fear

68     The accused persons had threatened to blacklist V1if she failed to follow their instructions or meet her daily revenue target in tips collection[^24]. They told her that if she failed to meet her revenue target, which was S$350 per day, she would not get her salary[^25]. Each time she failed to meet the target, the accused persons would show their “temper” at her and scolded her[^26]. Sometime in May 2016, Malkar had confronted her about her poor tips collection. He had hurled vulgarities at her and suggested that she should “_just sell \[her\] vagina and earn money_”. He also threatened to made life very difficult for her by blacklisting her just like he had done to many of his PAs in the past[^27].

69     V2 was told by Priyanka that if she did not collect S$10,000 per month in tips, she would only be paid 30,000 taka, which was half the salary stated in the contract[^28]. In one incident Priyanka, whilst drunk, had physically abused her because she had refused to go out with a customer[^29]. Going out with a customer was the euphemism for providing sexual services. V3 was told by Priyanka that her salary would be reduced if she failed to meet her daily revenue target of S$300[^30].

70     Malkar’s evidence that he had not told the PAs about their daily revenue target was flatly contradicted by his wife in her police statement (Exhibit P18)[^31], where she stated that Malkar had told the PAs that if they reached the target of S$8,000 or more, they would receive an increase in their salaries. In fact, according to Priyanka, there was some pressure to meet certain targets in relation to the tips collections because Rakesh’s expected share of the tips collection was S$50,000 a month. Against this backdrop, the victims’ evidence about the pressure that were brought to bear on them in relation to their tips collection was cogent.

#### (g)   Financial penalty to terminate contract

71     V1, V2 and V3said that they were made to sign employment contracts drafted in English even though none of them understood English. The contracts were not explained to them before they signed the contracts. They did not know that the contracts contained a penalty clause that required them to pay their two-way airfares plus one month’s salary to the company if they resign within three months 15 days of the contract[^32].

72     The victims’ evidence about being made to sign the employment contracts was corroborated by the accused persons themselves. In her police statement (Exhibit P19)[^33], Priyanka had stated that either Malkar or she would explain the employment contract to the PA. This evidence, coupled with the fact that the employment contracts were seized from their bedroom, contradicted the accused persons’ evidence that they had never asked the PA to sign the employment contract. I also rejected Malkar’s outrageous claim that he was not aware that the PAs had to sign the employment contracts. It was implausible that he, who had recruited the PA and were their employer, was not aware that they had to sign employment contracts.

## (3)   Exploitation i.e. servitude

73     In s 2 PHTA, exploitation came in the following forms - “_sexual exploitation, forced labour, slavery or any practice similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of an organ_”. In the present case, the prosecution relied on exploitation in the form of servitude. Servitude was defined in the same provision as “_… any condition or obligation, not authorised by any written law, to work or render services from which the individual cannot escape or which the individual is not free to change_”.

74     I was satisfied that “exploitation” and “servitude” have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. The work conditions or obligations imposed on the victims were not permitted by any written law. They could not escape these onerous conditions or obligations. They were also in no real position to change them.

75     Many of the conditions or obligations imposed on the victims were illegal or were in contravention of various written laws (see \[40\] above). To reiterate, these included no provision for days off for the entire period of the employment contract, the withholding of passports and work permits, and the non-payment of salary until after the police investigations started and the whole sordid enterprise was unravelled.

76     The victims were in no position whatsoever to escape or change the onerous conditions or obligations. They and their family were financially destitute. Their financial destitution was compounded by the fact that they were not paid their salaries or the tips money that they had rightfully earned. Resignation or termination of the contract were not realistic options for them. The onerous penalty clause ensured this. Further, they were totally cut-off from the outside world because their mobile phones had been taken away. Their communications with their family was strictly controlled and monitored. They were unable to seek help or advice concerning their plight.

77     The victims were also disabused of any notion that they could try to raise their concerns about their living and working conditions with the accused persons. This was because the accused persons had cultivated an atmosphere of fear into the victims. They achieved this through a litany of verbal abuses, including threats to blacklist or non-payment or reduction of salaries when the victims did not meet their targets or refused to go out with the clubs’ patrons. Apart from that, the victims were at the receiving ends of scoldings. These were for a variety of reasons, for example, for complaining about inappropriate touching by the patrons during their dance performances, for refusing to call the patrons to entice them to patronise the clubs more often, and in the case of V2, for refusing Priyanka’s instructions to go out with customers.

78     They could not even have run away. The Apartment was always kept locked. Their movements were severely curtailed and controlled. Whenever they left the Apartment it would be to go to work or when it was for something that needed to be done e.g., to attend medical examinations. Even so, they would be escorted either by the accused persons or the DJ. The fact that they did not have their passports or work permits, no mobile phones and no money, further dis-incentivised any thoughts of running away.

79     The evidence highlighted the stark disparity in the power dynamics between the accused persons and the victims. The victims in this case were at the mercy of the accused persons. Their reliance and dependence on the accused persons was total, and this was deliberate and by design. The regime instituted at the Apartment and at Kanggan by the accused persons were designed to ensure this. The relationship between the accused persons and the victims was a far cry from the ordinary employer-employee relationship that one would expect. The sense of helplessness felt by the victims was aptly captured in V1’s response to a question why she had never tried to challenge Priyanka’s authority. She said that she did not because “_…\[I\] used to think always that I’m confined in a jail, I have no right to talk_”.

80     The victims’ evidence was cogent and significantly consistent with one another in all the material respects. Granted that there were some differences in their evidence, but given the lapse of time and the fallibility of human memory, that was not unusual. In fact, these minor inconsistencies gave more credence to the fact that the victims were telling the truth, and that there was no collusion by them to frame the accused persons. I was satisfied that the victims had not fabricated their evidence. As the prosecution had rightly pointed out, they were economic migrants. Their sole purpose in making the journey to Singapore was to work and earn money. Therefore, there was no reason for them to fabricate these allegations against the accused persons because, as the prosecution had rightly pointed out, doing that would have jeopardised their employment at the clubs, which was their only source of income.

### THE WOMEN’S CHARTER (“WC”) OFFENCES

### The Prosecution’s Case

## (1)   Procuring for the purposes of prostitution – s 140(1)(b)

82     The prosecution’s case was that about a month after V2’s arrival, in the restroom at Kanggan, Priyanka had told her she would have to collect S$10,000 worth of tips each month, failing which she would only be paid half of her salary of 60,000 taka. In the same conversation, Priyanka had also told her that she would have to go out with customers, which V2 knew meant that she had to provide sexual services to customers for money. When V2 refused and asked to go back to Bangladesh, Priyanka demanded payment of four Bangladeshi Lakh (“lakh”) before she could return home. Four lakh was equivalent to 100,000 taka[^34].

83     After that conversation, Priyanka pestered and badgered V2 on the same topic. In order to persuade her, Priyanka promised her high earnings, and at the same time referencing V2’s poor tips collection which fell far short of her monthly target. V2 was even promised that she could retain half of what she earned. In the face of Priyanka’s relentless badgering, V2 reluctantly agreed. Sometime between February and March 2016, V2 had provided sexual services to one Sohel, a patron of Kanggan. The tryst was conducted at a hotel. V2 received S$400 from Sohel for her sexual services[^35].

84     Although Priyanka was the main protagonist, V2 had also pointed to occasions when she would be in the bedroom of the accused persons at the Apartment and both Priyanka and Malkar had cajoled and coaxed her to “_go out with big customers_” to increase her tips collection[^36].

## (2)   Living in part on the earnings of prostitution – s 146(1)

85     The charge of living in part on the earnings of prostitution was a common intention one i.e; that the two accused persons had received the monies from V2 knowing that the monies were earned through prostitution, in furtherance of the common intention of them both.

86     The prosecution contended that V2 had engaged in sexual intercourse with three of Kanggan’s customers on the accused persons’ instructions. The details were set out below -

## (3)   Managing/assisting to manage a place of assignation – s 147(2)

87     Following from the preceding paragraphs above, the prosecution submitted that, sometime between December 2015 to 1 Jun 2016, Malkar had managed Kanggan as a place of assignation, and Priyanka had assisted him in managing it. In s 2 WC, a “place of assignation” was defined as “_any place where communication is established with any woman or girl, either directly or through an intermediary, for any immoral purpose_”.

88     The prosecution submitted that Malkar was Kanggan’s sole managing operator during the material period. He was responsible for its day to day operations[^37]. Priyanka had assisted Malkar to run the operations at Kanggan, where she “_…\[took\] care of the performing artists working \[there\]…_”. She had “_…briefed them on some of the rules such as they are not allowed to drink alcohol during working hours,…_”. She was in Kanggan from about 10.00 pm to 11.00 pm every night to oversee the PAs. Sometimes she acted as interpreter between them and the patrons[^38]. She was present during the club’s operational hours. She also counted the money from the tips box, and tally the amount into the tips register. Her omnipresence and active role in Kanggan was such that the PAs came to regard her as the manager at Kanggan.[^39].

89     V2 had testified that Priyanka had suggested to her while at Kanggan that she could go out and have sex with customers as a way to earn more money. She had been introduced to some “big customers” by Priyanka at the club. The accused persons had told her that she should go out with these big customers because they would pay more[^40].

90     The prosecution also highlighted that Priyanka had confirmed in her police statement (Exhibit P19) that the PAs had gone out with the customers. She also said that although it was not compulsory for the customers to pay to go out with the PAs, sometimes the PAs demanded payment ranging from S$200 to S$2,000[^41]. Priyanka had also said that Malkar had told the PAs that if there were good customers, and if they were willing to go out with these customers, they could do so[^42].

91     Lastly, the prosecution relied on the statement of an ex-senior manager of Kanggan named Shaik Anwar bin Yusoff Basawari (“Shaik Anwar”). Shaik Anwar had passed away before the trial commenced. His police statement was admitted pursuant to s 32(1)(j) of the Evidence Act[^43]. Shaik Anwar had confirmed that both accused persons had worked at Kanggan and they were primarily in-charge of recruitment of the PAs, briefing them of their duties at the club and ensuring that they met the monthly revenue target[^44]. He also revealed that the customers had to make arrangements with the accused persons if they wished to take them out of the club. He had seen customers handing money ranging from S$500 to S$2,000 to the accused persons for this purpose. The accused persons would then hand the money to him to be deposited into the tips collection box[^45].

### The Defence’s Case

92     The accused persons denied any involvement in procuring or arranging the sex liaisons between their PAs, and specifically V2, and the customers. Priyanka added that she had no role at all in the management of Kanggan. She denied that she had told V2 to go out with customers for sexual intercourse. Malkar repeated the same denials. He also supported Priyanka’s claim that she had no role in Kanggan and that she had little or no interaction with the victims even at the Apartment.

### Analysis of the Evidence

93     I was satisfied that V2’s evidence was cogent and consistent. V2 was able to describe the incidents in great detail. She was able to describe the specific locations where she had provided the sexual services, to whom she had provided the services, and the payments made by the customers and even the gifts that she had received from her customers (see table at \[86\]).

94     She pointed out that the money that the customers paid at Kanggan to take her out were either deposited into the tips box or was paid to Priyanka. This was consistent with Shaik Anwar’s statement. She had also described how Priyanka would wait for her to return to the Apartment, and body-searched her for cash and other items that the customers had given her as gifts, and confiscated them[^46]. This was consistent with the recovery of two such items from the accused persons’ bedroom - a mobile phone and a gold chain – by the police. The gold chain was inside an envelope with the name “Megla” written on it. V2 was also known as “Megla”. I rejected Priyanka’s explanation that Malkar had found the gold chain at Kanggan, and he had given it to her for safe-keeping. If it had indeed been found at the club, the natural thing to do was return it to V2. There was no reason for her to keep it.

95     V2 had been steadfast in her testimony. She was not contradicted in any significant or material way during cross-examination. As shown in the preceding paragraphs, her evidence was internally and externally consistent. Lastly, there was no reason for V2 to fabricate evidence against the accused persons.

96     The statement by Shaik Anwar was cogent and consistent with the other evidence. As a senior manager, it was wholly reasonable for Shaik Anwar to know the accused persons’ respective roles and responsibilities in the club. He would be aware of the affairs of the club and how it ran its business. The defence had tried to taint the statement by suggesting that Shaik Anwar had an axe to grind against the accused persons. However, it was a bare assertion without any supporting evidence.

97     I rejected the defence mounted by the accused persons. My reasons were set out below.

98     In her police statement dated 4 Jun 16, Priyanka had admitted that she knew that V2 had gone out with customers and provided sexual services to them[^47]. She gave details e.g., how many times V2 had gone out for that purpose (two to three times), and how much she was paid (S$100 to S$200)[^48].

99     Her evidence also put paid to Malkar’s claim that his PAs had never gone out with customers and provided sexual services to them. Priyanka had said that Malkar was aware of this fact, and more significantly, the customers had to ask Malkar if they wanted to take his PAs out –

> Exhibit P19:

> “Q10. Is ‘Johnny’ \[Malkar\] aware that the performing artiste are providing sexual services to the customers?

> A10.  Yes.

> Q11.  How is ‘Johnny’ aware of this?

> A11.  I was the one who told him.”

> Exhibit P17:

> “Q26. Our investigations have revealed that when the customers wish to bring the performing artiste out they will have to consult you or ‘Johnny’. What do you have to say?

> A26.  They have to consult ‘Johnny’ but not me. ‘Johnny’ has worked a long time in the pub and he knew all the customers.”

Pertinently, this was consistent with what Shaik Anwar said in his statement to the police; that the club’s patron had to deal with the accused persons if they wanted to go out with the PAs.

100    There was no doubt that the evidence showed that Malkar was the sole managing operator of Kanggan in charge of its day to day operations, and that Priyanka had assisted him in managing and running the club. The evidence also showed that all dealings connected to the provision of sexual services by V2 had taken place in the club. The deals were made through Malkar and Priyanka who were not just V2’s bosses, but also her pimp. As such, Kanggan had been used as a place of assignation.

101    Lastly, the accused persons stood to directly gain from the tips collected by the PAs. Priyanka, in her third police statement[^49], had explained how they benefited from it. She said that Malkar received a flat 40% of the total monthly tips collected at Kanggan. From the 40%, he would retain S$4,050 as his monthly salary. He would also use the 40% to pay off certain expenditures e.g., air-ticket purchases for performing artists, payments of agent fees, meals and levy fees. The balance, after deducting his salary and the expenditures, was for him to keep. Therefore, the higher the tips collection, the more Malkar would retain for himself. Her evidence contradicted Malkar’s claim that the balance of the 40%, after deducting his salary and other expenditures, was returned to Rakesh. I rejected his evidence.

102    Clearly, both the accused persons stood to benefit from a higher tips collection. Malkar benefitted because he retained the balance of the 40%. And as his wife, Priyanka also stood to benefit. Recognising the lucrative earnings that could be had from prostitution, and the gains that they could personally enjoy from it, they had badgered V2 into prostituting herself as a means of enriching themselves.

### ADMISSIBILITY OF PRIYANKA’S POLICE STATEMENTS

103    I would now address the issue of the three statements made by Priyanka to Melvin Hong (Exhibits P17, P18 and P19). The defence had contended that these statements had not been given voluntarily. The specific allegations against Melvin Hong were as follow -

> (a)     He had uttered the words, “will you send your daughter to the people for this type of work”, which was insulting to her and insinuating that something would happen to her daughter.

> (b)     He had asked her, “do you go to the customers also?”, which was derogatory and insulting to her. It made her frightened and anxious for her daughter’s and her modesty.

> (c)     He had said the following many times, “Whatever you are telling is not the truth. Whatever I am telling, that is the truth, or you will go 5 years in the jail”.

> (d)     He had forced her to sign the statements saying, “Otherwise, you will rot here, you will not get bail”. She also alleged that he had held her jaw with his hands when forcing her to sign the statements. When she continued to refuse, he held her hair thereby frightening her into signing her statements.

> (e)     In one or two of the statement recordings, he had been aggressive and had threatened her using handcuffs.

> (f)     He had used various Chinese vulgarities and expletives at her.

104    For good measure, the defence also alleged oppression such that her free will was sapped when the statements were recorded from her. This was because the day before Exhibits P18 and P19 were recorded, she had been found unconscious in her cell. She was conveyed to hospital where she was prescribed medication and was discharged. Therefore, a confluence of all these factors - the constant verbal threats and physical abuse, the oppressive conditions in the remand cell, and her being unwell and on medication - had the effect of sapping her free will.

105    In the ancillary hearing, Melvin Hong categorically denied all the allegations raised. He testified that he had followed all the procedures and protocols governing the recording of statements. He said that she was alert and able to give her statements on the three occasions. In fact, Priyanka had been asked on each occasion whether she felt well to give her statement and she had answered in the affirmative. He maintained that the statements were voluntarily made by Priyanka. They were read back to her. She was offered to make amendments, additions or deletions. Finally, she had penned her signatures on the statements without being forced to do so.

106    His evidence was corroborated by the evidence of the Hindi interpreter, Gurdev Singh s/o Argin Singh (“Gurdev Singh”). Gurdev Singh was present during all the recording sessions. He had confirmed that Priyanka had told them that she had felt well to give her statements[^50]. His account of the three recording sessions also did not reveal any of the specific allegations raised by the defence. Gurdev Singh had also said during cross-examination that Melvin Hong’s behaviour towards Priyanka had been normal, and that he had not raised his voice. Significantly, the defence did not challenge his evidence during cross-examination.

107    Gurdev Singh was a very experienced interpreter. As a free-lance interpreter, he was also an independent witness. I found his evidence to be cogent. What stood out was when he said that if Priyanka had been frightened or had shown fear, he would have stopped his interpretation services[^51]. The fact that he had continued to interpret for Priyanka in all three statements to their conclusion showed that the defence’s allegations were wholly without merit. And as I had highlighted earlier, his evidence was not contradicted by the defence. The defence did not put the specific allegations to him in cross-examination. I had no doubt in my mind that the allegations were fabrications by Priyanka. I was also satisfied that there was no oppression. The three statements recorded from Priyanka were voluntarily made and I admitted them into evidence.

## THE SENTENCE

## The prosecution’s submissions on sentence

108    The prosecution submitted for a global sentence of at least six years’ imprisonment and fine of $7,500 for each accused persons.

### The PHTA Charges

109    The prosecution set out the rationale for the enactment of the Act. They cited the speech of Member of Parliament, Christopher De Souza[^52], at the Second Reading of the Prevention of Human Trafficking Bill, where he outlined the broader context and policy intent behind the Act. The relevant excerpt which was quoted in the Prosecution’s Sentencing Submissions were reproduced below –

> Human trafficking is the acquisition of an individual by improper means such as force, fraud or deception, with the aim of exploiting them. It is a lucrative transnational crime involving the recruitment, manipulation, and abuse of vulnerable individuals. Many have referred to Trafficking-in-Persons, or TIP in short, as modern day slavery, and the global problem remains acute.

> Singapore is often described as a destination country for TIP. Through our existing criminal laws and active enforcement, the TIP situation in Singapore has been kept under control. Notwithstanding this, Singapore remains vulnerable to such crimes, not least because of our attractive economic conditions and status as a regional hub. This challenge is exacerbated by the increased movement of persons across national boundaries today, and the ease with which they can do so. As such, we must continue to effectively detect and deter TIP activities with strong laws, supported by robust enforcement and victim support measures.

> \[…\]

> Mdm Speaker, human trafficking is real; it is cruel; and it must be stemmed. We, as a society, must speak up for the voiceless and helpless by sending as a strong a signal as we can against these serious crimes. Indeed, this is the ethos behind the Bill. To prevent TIP from taking root in our community, our laws have to be comprehensive yet targeted, possess 13 sufficient bite to punish perpetrators and deter would-be offenders, and offer protection and support to those in need.

He also added that the stiff penalties prescribed were “_\[t\]o provide sufficient deterrence and reflect the severity of human trafficking_”[^53].

110    As such, the prosecution submitted that one of the key reasons for the enactment of PHTA was to provide for severe penalties to ensure a strong level of deterrence against human trafficking. Therefore, the overarching sentencing objectives should be to ensure that the accused persons received just punishment for their actions, and in particular strongly deterred such acts as part of the wider aim of combatting and eliminating human trafficking in Singapore.

## (1)   The Adjusted _Poh Boon Kiat_ Sentencing Framework

111    As this was the first convicted case of human trafficking under PHTA, the prosecution submitted that guidance could be taken from the sentencing approach adopted in human trafficking cases involving sexual exploitation. For these cases, the courts have recognised that the sentencing framework in _Poh Boon Kiat v PP_[^54] (“_Poh Boon Kiat_”) provided a good starting point, but with the necessary upward modification in the starting points and ranges to account for the full range of sentences provided by PHTA: see _PP v BSR_[^55].

112    The prescribed punishment for a first offender of a s 3(1) PHTA offence was a fine not exceeding $100,000 and imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years, and shall be liable to caning not exceeding 6 stroke. The prosecution formulated what they called the adjusted _Poh Boon Kiat_ framework to account for the fact that PHTA was a more serious crime. They submitted that the adjusted framework could provide a useful starting point. The adjusted framework was reproduced below –

113    The prosecution also submitted that some guidance could be obtained from case law from the United Kingdom on the analytical approach used in assessing the severity of labour exploitation. In _R v Shahnawaz Ali Khan, Raza Ali Khan and Perveen Khan_[^56], the English Court of Appeal adopted the following set of factors to assess the seriousness of a labour trafficking case –

> a.     the nature and degree of deception or coercion exercised upon the incoming worker;

> b.     the nature and degree of exploitation exercised upon the worker on arrival in the work place;

> c.     the level and methods of control exercised over the worker with a view to ensuring that he remains economically trapped;

> d.     the level of vulnerability of the incoming worker, usually economic but also physical and psychological;

> e.     the degree of harm suffered by the worker - physical, psychological and financial;

> f.     the level of organisation and planning behind the scheme, the gain sought or achieved, and the offender’s status and role within the organisation;

> g.     the number of those exploited; and

> h.     previous convictions for similar offences.

114    The prosecution submitted that the above factors were useful to provide an analytical framework to complement the _Poh Boon Kiat_ culpability-harm matrix. For example, they submitted that factors (a) to (d) were pertinent for culpability while factor (e) for harm.

115    The prosecution submitted that the present case fell within ‘A Culpability’ and “Category 2 Harm’ of the adjusted framework.

## (2)   Culpability

116    The prosecution submitted that the accused persons’ culpability fell within the highest level for the following reasons –

> (a)      Victims highly vulnerable

> The victims were foreign nationals. They were young and unsophisticated. They came from poor backgrounds and were easily lured by the offer to work in Singapore. They did not speak the local languages. They were not familiar with the local systems. They did not know their rights as workers. They were solely dependent on the accused persons. The imbalance of power was significant, and the accused persons exploited these vulnerabilities.

> (b)      Victims’ freedom severely curtailed

> The victims were confined to the Apartment when they were not working. Their movements were tightly controlled. They were always escorted to and from work. This served to exacerbate their vulnerability and isolation.

> (c)      Methods used to maintain control over victims

> The victims’ passports and mobile phones were confiscated on their arrival. Their work permits were withheld. All communications with the outside world was cut off. This served to enhanced the victims’ feelings of vulnerability and helplessness. Deceptive methods were also used to add to these feelings, for example, V2 was told that if she went out without her work permit, the police would arrest her, and that there were CCTV cameras in the house.

> The accused persons made the victims sign a contract which required them to pay a significant financial penalty if they wished to terminate their employment. This had caused the victims to believe that it was not possible for them to do so.

> All the above had the cumulative effect of making the victims felt that they were trapped in the situation and had no alternative but to continue working for the accused persons and complying with their instructions.

> (d)      Exploitative treatment of the victims

> The victims were exploited severely. They were made to work every night without any day off. They had to work even when they were sick. Proper medical treatment was not provided to them when they were sick. They were subjected to verbal abuse (V1) and physical abuse (V2). Their salaries were also not paid to them.

> (e)      Deception in the procurement of the victims

> There was a degree of deception in the recruitment of the victims. They were promised work as PAs, but was not told that they would be asked or required to provide sexual services. They were not told about the contractual conditions including the financial penalty that would be imposed if they wish to terminate the contract.

> (f)      Primary roles played in enterprise

> The accused persons played primary roles in the entire scheme. They exercised control and authority over the victims. The enterprise was elaborate, substantial and lucrative. They ran it for a prolonged period of time. They had reaped significant financial benefit from the exploitation of the victims.

## (3)   Harm

117    The prosecution submitted that the case fell within the higher range of ‘Category 2 Harm’. This was because there were elements of abuse, a significant curtailment of personal autonomy, and some degree of coercion to perform sexual services.

118    For all these reasons, the prosecution proposed the sentences set out below. They highlighted that the individual sentences have been calibrated to take into account the differing periods of exploitation of the victims, as that affected the degree of harm suffered by each victim –

> (a)     In relation to V2 (period from 23 Dec 15 to 21 May 16), four years’ imprisonment and fine $2,500;

> (b)     In relation to V3 (period from 20 May 16 to 1 Jun 16), two years’ imprisonment and fine $2,500;

> (c)     In relation to V1 (period from 8 Apr 16 to 1 Jun 16), three years’ imprisonment and fine $2,500.

119    The prosecution explained that the proposed fine amounts (totalling $15,000 for both accused persons) was to disgorge the financial gains received by the accused persons. The financial gains were based on the recorded tips collection amounts of the three victims.

### The WC Charges

120    In determining the appropriate sentences, the _Poh Boon Kiat_ culpability-harm sentencing matrix was applicable. The prosecution submitted that the present case fell within ‘A Culpability’ and ‘Cat 2 Harm’.

121    The prosecution highlighted that the accused persons had jointly played an integral role and were the main perpetrators of the entire vice operation. They sourced for the male customers, set the prices to be charged, and secured the transactions with them.

122    They had also actively limited the victims’ freedom. There were also elements of deception in the recruitment process of the victims. There was also undue pressure applied in procuring the victims to offer sexual services. Priyanka had enticed V2to have sexual intercourse with the club’s patrons by promising her that she could retain half of her earnings. However, this turned out to be a false promise. V2 was not allowed to retain half her earnings. Instead on her return from providing sexual services, she was subjected to an intrusive and demeaning body search by Priyanka, who searched for and confiscated any cash or items of value, from her. V2 had also been sent out to provide sexual services on multiple occasions over a prolonged period of months. She was not given respite when she was menstruating.

123    The prosecution then highlighted the following aggravating factors that featured in the case –

> (a)      Transnational element of the operation:

> The victims had been brought into Singapore under the impression that they would work legitimately as performing artists. They were not informed that they were expected to provide sexual services as well. The procurement of sexual workers, even if they were willing parties, encouraged the international trafficking of women and this brings disrepute to Singapore (at \[84(b)\] of _Poh Boon Kiat_.

> (b)      Difficulty of detection of such offences:

> The offences were committed within the context of a legitimate business, making the offences more difficult to detect. The difficulty was exacerbated by the severe restrictions imposed on the victims’ liberty, communication and movement.

124    For these reasons, the prosecution sought at least two years’ imprisonment for (i) the procurement for the purpose of prostitution and (ii) living in part on the earnings of prostitution charges, and at least one year’s imprisonment for managing and assisting to manage Kanggan as a place of assignation.

## THE MITIGATION PLEA

125    The Court was informed that the accused persons were married in 2013. Malkar was engaged as manager of Kanggan in 2009. He was on a work permit. The accused persons has a child who was cared for by Priyanka’s parents in India. Malkar’s father had passed away in the midst of the trial, and as a result, he was unable to attend the funeral. The Court was also informed that the club Kanggan had been closed for business since June 2016. As a result, the accused persons have not been able to support their family in India.

126    On sentencing, the defence urged the court to follow the same sentences that were imposed in the case of _PP v Thakkar Hardik Anilkumar[^57]_(“_Thakkar Hardik_”). The accused person in _Thakkar Hardik_ operated a club with the same business model as in the present case. The club was South Indian themed, and featured dancers who performed every night for the patrons’ enjoyment. The dancers collected tips from the patrons and the tips were placed into individual boxes bearing the dancers’ names.

127    The majority of the dancers had hailed from Bangladesh. They signed employment contracts that contained, inter alia, an onerous penalty clause for early termination of the contract. The dancers’ movement and communications were tightly controlled and curtailed. They had monthly revenue targets they had to meet. They were told that they had to go out with customers for sex in order to increase their tips collection.

128    The accused person was convicted on seven charges under the WC. The sentences imposed were –

> (a)     Two months’ imprisonment for one charge of managing a place of assignation – s 147(2) WC;

> (b)     Five months’ imprisonment each on five charges of attempting to procure a woman, by way of threats, to have carnal connection except by way of marriage – s 140(1)(c) r/w s 140(1)(j) WC.

> (c)     Eight months imprisonment for one charge of procuring a woman, by way of threats, to have carnal connection except by way of marriage – s 140(1)(c) WC.

129    Three of the imprisonment sentences were order to run consecutively – the s 147(1) charge, the s 140(1)(a) charge, and one s 140(1)(c) r/w s 140(1)(j) charge. The global sentence was 15 months’ imprisonment. The accused person’s appeal against conviction and sentence was dismissed.

130    The defence submitted that as the factual matrixes in the two cases were so similar, the same sentences for the equivalent WC charges should follow. They made no specific submissions on the sentences for the PHTA offences, but urged the Court to impose the same sentences as that for the WC charges. Their final submission was that the global sentence should not exceed 30 months’ imprisonment.

## REASONS FOR THE SENTENCES

### The WC Charges

131    I would first deal with the WC charges. In determining the sentences for these offences, I applied the sentencing framework set out in _Poh Boon Kiat_. In this regard, for the reasons set out by the prosecution at \[121\] to \[123\], I agreed the accused persons fell within the ‘A Culpability’ and ‘Cat 2 Harm’ of the _Poh Boon Kiat_ framework for the procurement for the purposes of prostitution charge (s 140(1)(b) WC) and the living in part on the earnings of prostitution (s 146(1) WC read with s 34 PC) charge.

132    As the main perpetrators, they played integral roles in the whole enterprise. They had sourced for potential customers from among the club’s patrons. They decided on the price for the sexual services. They were unrelenting in their efforts to get V2 a to sell her body for money. Their persistence, coupled with their absolute control over V2’s life, made it inevitable that V2 succumbed to the pressure.

133    The transnational element was an additional aggravating factor. V2 had been procured from Bangladesh. She came here to work as a PA in a club. She was then pressured into prostitution. Also, the offences were hard to detect because they were committed within the protective cloak of a legitimate business. V2’s isolation from her family and the severe restrictions placed on her movement and communication made it almost impossible for her to seek help.

134    Although I was mindful that the starting point under ‘A Culpability’ and ‘Cat 2 Harm’ was two years’ imprisonment, I imposed a sentence at the lower of the indicative range ie, one year’s and six months’ imprisonment. I did not agree with the defence’s submission that I should follow the sentences imposed in _Thakkar Hardik_ because that case was sentenced on the basis of the “B Culpability” and “Cat 2 Harm” category. Further, in that case, the victim had only rendered sexual services once. In the present case, V2 had done so four times.

135    For the managing and assisting in the management of a place of assignation charge (s 147(2) WC), I agreed with the prosecution that it fell within the ‘A Culpability’ and ‘Cat 2 Harm’ category of the _Poh Boon Kiat_ framework[^58]. The starting point under this category was one year’s imprisonment, with the indicative range set at nine months’ to one year six months’ imprisonment. The same aggravating factors for the earlier two WC offences applied to this offence as well. All considered, I imposed a sentence at the lower end of the indicative range i.e., nine months’ imprisonment.

### The PHTA Charges

136    For the PHTA charges, although I do not endorse the adjusted _Poh Boon Kiat_ framework proposed by the prosecution, it served as a useful guide in determining the appropriate sentences. My approach was to apply the sentencing methodology applied by Chan Seng Onn J in _BSR[^59]_.

137    The facts of _BSR_ were very egregious. A succinct summary of the facts are contained at \[51\] of the Judgment –

> “\[T\]he Accused had, against a backdrop of prolonged domestic violence, forced his wife into prostitution. During the period of her prostitution, he continued to inflict violence on her for various reasons, including to ensure that she met the quota of clients he had stipulated for her; or so that she would give in to his demands. He further ensured that additional trauma and degradation would be visited on her by insisting that she secretly film her sexual acts with her customers, and that she provide those recordings to him thereafter.”

138    As a result of the Accused’s demands, his wife had provided sexual services to about 138 customers, serving an average of three to five customers a day in the short span of less than three months. The High Court sentenced the Accused to six years’ imprisonment and a fine of S$6,000 for each of the two PHTA charges. It also imposed three strokes of the cane.

139    It was significant to note that the PHTA charges preferred in _BSR_ was trafficking in persons for the purpose of exploitation by means of “_the threat or use of force, or any other form of coercion_”. The exploitation relied on was “_sexual exploitation_” which referred to “_the involving of the individual in prostitution … or the provision of any other form of sexual service_”. The PHTA charges in the present case were significantly different. That and the factual matrix in _BSR_ clearly made that case more egregious than the present case. Therefore, the sentences that I imposed in the present case must necessarily be lower than that meted out in _BSR_, even after factoring the fact that the Accused in _BSR_ had pleaded guilty.

140    I then considered the _Poh Boon Kiat_ framework for offences under ss 140 and 146 WC. The aggravating factors set out by the prosecution which I agreed with, placed the case within the ‘A Culpability’ and ‘Cat 2 Harm’ of the _Poh Boon Kiat_ framework. That placed the indicative sentencing range at 1 year’s 6 months’ to three years’ imprisonment.

141    However, I was mindful that the PHTA carried more severe penalties, including imprisonment of up to 10 years and to caning. The maximum imprisonment prescribed was double that of offences under ss 140 and 146 WC. As the sentencing judge, I was duty-bound to consider the full spectrum of sentences prescribed by Parliament in determining the appropriate sentence[^60]. As such, the indicative sentencing range mentioned above would have to be adjusted upwards to properly reflect the full spectrum of sentences prescribed in the PHTA.

142    Having regard to the aggravating factors present in the case, I agreed with the prosecution that the appropriate sentence for the charge relating to V2 was four years’ imprisonment. As for the other two victims, V3 and V1, the sentence should be two years imprisonment. The difference in the sentences was on account of the length of time the offences were committed on the victims; V2’s being the longest. Although the prosecution asked for three years’ imprisonment for the charge in relation to V1 because the offence period in her case was some six weeks longer than V3, I was of the opinion that the difference was not so significant that it warranted different sentences.

143    I disagreed with the prosecution’s submissions that the sentences in two of the three PHTA charges should run consecutively. This was because they related to the same protected legal interest. Instead, I ordered that the sentences in the PHTA charge involving V2 (i.e. four years’ imprisonment) run consecutively with the WC charge of living in part on the immoral earnings of prostitution (i.e. one year’s and six months’ imprisonment). as the two charges related to different protected legal interests. Therefore, the total aggregate sentence for each of the accused persons was five years’ and six months’ imprisonment. In my view, the total sentence was not excessive and it reflected the seriousness of the offences committed by the accused persons.

144    In addition to imprisonment, I also imposed a fine of $2,500 for each of the six PHTA charges. The total fine amount of S$15,000 (for both accused persons) was to disgorge the financial gains that they had received, based on the recorded tips collection amounts of the three victims adduced at the trial.

## COMPENSATION ORDER UNDER S 359 CPC

145    The prosecution also sought for a compensation order for the amount S$4,878.31 against Malkar. The amount was to be paid to V2 as compensation for unpaid salary for work done by her from 22 Dec 15 to 20 May 16 (“the relevant period”). Malkar was the person in charge of paying her salary, and so the compensation order should rightly be made against him.

146    The prosecution set out the breakdown of the amount sought for –

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="31.12%"> <col width="35.12%"> <col width="33.76%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Month</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Amount Due</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Remarks</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Dec 2015</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">(22 to 31 Dec 15)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$316.77</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Worked for 10 days out of 31 days in Dec</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Jan 2016</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$982</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="3" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Worked for the whole month</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Feb 2016</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$982</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Apr 2016</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$982</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">1 to 20 May 16</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$633.54</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Worked for 20 days out of 31 days in May</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Total:</b></p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$4,878.51</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

147    In exercising its discretion to make a compensation order, the court must apply the following principles[^61] –

> (a)     The intention of the order was not to punish the offender. It was to allow the victim to recover compensation where a civil suit was an inadequate or impractical remedy. This included, but was not confined to, cases where the victim was impecunious.

> (b)     The order should only be made in clear cases where the fact and extent of damage were either agreed, or readily and easily ascertainable on the evidence.

> (c)     A broad common sense approach should be adopted in assessing whether compensation should be awarded. The court should not enmesh itself in “refined questions of causation”. The court should be able to say, with a high degree of confidence, that the damage in question had been caused by the offence under circumstances which ordinarily entitled the victim to damages.

> (d)     The amount ordered should not exceed what would be reasonably obtainable in civil proceedings. The order should only be made in respect of the injury which resulted from the offence for which the offender was convicted.

> (e)     The order should not be oppressive. The court must be satisfied that the accused person would have the means to pay it within a reasonable time.

148    The evidence that came out in the trial was that V2 had not received any salary for her work during the relevant period[^62]. In their reply to the prosecution’s submission, the defence submitted that V2’s salary for the relevant period had already been paid in advance. It was pertinent to note that V2 was not challenged when she testified that she had not received any salary for the whole of the relevant period. The claim that her entire salary had been paid in advance was also not put to her. To assert this claim now in their submission was unacceptable as it was wholly without any basis. As such, I rejected the defence’s submission.

149    Applying the principles set out in \[147\], I found that it was appropriate to make a compensation order in this case. V2 belonged to the class of victims for whom it was impractical to commence a civil suit to recover unpaid salary. I was also satisfied that the quantum was easily ascertainable and quantifiable. Lastly, the amount of S$4,878.31 was not so large as to be oppressive. All considered, I ordered that Malkar pay compensation of S$4,878.31 to V2, in default to serve two weeks’ imprisonment.

150    The accused persons have lodged appeals against conviction and sentence. They are on bail pending the appeals.
