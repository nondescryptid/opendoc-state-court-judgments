\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9277/2019/01 .\]

9 December 2019

### District Judge Kan Shuk Weng:

## (1)   Introduction

1       The Accused, a 36-year-old male Singaporean, claimed trial to:

> (i)     a charge of committing criminal intimidation under section 506 (2nd limb) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (the “Penal Code”), by threatening one Mdm Ganthimathi d/o Sockalingam (“Mdm Ganthi”) that he would burn her house down, (the “criminal intimidation charge”); and

> (ii)     a charge of committing mischief, by toppling and breaking the flower pots belonging to Mdm Ganthi, under section 426 of the Penal Code (the “mischief charge”).

The offences were allegedly committed on 17 May 2018 at or about 11.32 am at the corridor outside Mdm Ganthi’s residence at #XXX, block 879 Tampines Ave 8 (“the Unit”). Eight other charges were stood down.

2       The Accused was in person.

3       On 31 October 2019, I acquitted the Accused on both the charges at the close of defence case. With respect to the stood down charges, the Accused pleaded guilty to five of the charges on 28 November 2019. The remaining three charges were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The Accused was sentenced to 22 weeks’ imprisonment with effect from 31 July 2018.

4       The Prosecution filed an appeal against the acquittal. I now set out my reasons for my decision.

## (2)   The Prosecution’s Case

5       The Prosecution adduced evidence that Mdm Ganthi made a ‘999’ to the police on 17 May 2018 at 11.32 am, and reported as follows:

> My second son want \[sic\] to open the door. He is outside my house breaking the window and the things outside.

6       The Accused was no longer at the scene by the time the police arrived. Station Inspector Celeste Ang (“SI Celeste Ang”) spoke to Mdm Ganthi and proceeded to record a statement from Mdm Ganthi at 12.15 pm. The Accused was eventually arrested for other offences which were unrelated to the present case.

7       I will set out the Prosecution’s case in four parts:

> (a)     the evidence of Mdm Ganthi;

> (b)     the statement given by Mdm Ganthi to SI Celeste Ang;

> (c)     the evidence of the officers at the scene; and

> (d)     the evidence of the Investigation Officer.

### (a)   The evidence of Mdm Ganthi

8       Mdm Ganthi (PW1) is the mother of the Accused and gave her evidence in Tamil. Mdm Ganthi testified that she had been staying at the Unit since 15 December 2011. The Unit was in her name, and the name of her elder son, Bryan Vivek Anandan. The Accused is her younger son[^1].

9       Mdm Ganthi testified that on 17 May 2018, she saw the Accused standing at the lift lobby at about 7.45 am to 8.00 am when she returned home from work. She allowed the Accused to enter the Unit to have his shower. The Accused left after having his shower and Mdm Ganthi then went to bed[^2].

10     Mdm Ganthi claimed that the Accused returned sometime later and knocked on the door of the Unit, wanting to be let in. However, she refused to let him in as she wanted to sleep[^3]. The Accused then started shaking the gate, and banging on the door. According to the Mdm Ganthi, the Accused also attempted to break the window, and this led her to call the police[^4] to report that “my second son want \[sic\] to open the door. He is outside my house breaking the window and the things outside”[^5] (the “FIR”).

11     Mdm Ganthi testified that she did not know what the Accused was doing outside as she was in the Unit, and the door was closed. However, she could hear the sound of the Accused trying to break the window[^6]. When the police arrived, she opened the door and saw that the flower pots outside the Unit were broken. Mdm Ganthi further testified that she did not know what had happened to the flower pots prior to the arrival of the police[^7]. She could not remember how long the police took to get to the Unit, but that it was “probably within half an hour”[^8].

12     It was Mdm Ganthi’s testimony that the plants along the corridor, outside the Unit, were hers. When asked about the state of the plants in photograph P2:3, her evidence was “at times when the wind blows very strongly, the flower pots do fall off like this”[^9]. In relation to the pot that was broken, when asked who could have broken the pot, Mdm Ganthi’s reply was “it should be \[the Accused\]”[^10]. That was because no one else would “dare to break her plants”, and that the Accused had broken her flower pots in the past[^11].

13     Mdm Ganthi was unable to recall what the Accused said to her when she refused to open the door for him[^12].

14     In cross-examination, Mdm Ganthi agreed that she had called the police may times on the Accused[^13], and that she had previously applied for a Personal Protection Order (“PPO”) and Domestic Exclusion Order (“DXO”) against the Accused[^14]. The PPO was eventually cancelled[^15]. She clarified that she called the police on 17 May 2018 because the Accused was “breaking the things outside and causing a lot of noise”, and she “needed to sleep”. It was not because the Accused had threatened her[^16].

### (b)   Mdm Ganthi’s statement

15     As Mdm Ganthi claimed persistently in court that she had forgotten what the Accused said to her on 17 May 2018, the Prosecution sought to cross-examine Mdm Ganthi under section 156 of the Evidence Act (Cap. 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (the “Evidence Act”)[^17]. The Prosecution further applied to substitute her oral testimony with her written statement to the police under section 147(3) of the Evidence Act[^18] on the basis that she was hostile. It was put to Mdm Ganthi that she knew that the criminal intimidation charge was a serious offence[^19] and it was difficult for her to testify against the Accused[^20]. Mdm Ganthi denied this.

16     Mdm Ganthi’s statement (P3) was recorded by SI Celeste on 17 May 2018 at 12.15 pm in English[^21]. The offence was classified by SI Celeste as “breach of PPO”[^22].

17     Mdm Ganthi’s statement is reproduced below:

> I am known as Ganthimati to my family and friends. I am staying at the above mentioned address together with my family since 2001. I am working as a cashier for the past 1 month plus at U Star Supermarket located at Blk 878C Tampines Ave 8.

> On 17/5/18 at about 0735 hrs, I returned home from work and I spotted my son Kelvin Sunderesan s/o Retchagadas SXXX standing outside the lift lobby. My son then told me that he need \[sic\] to take his shirt. I just ignored him. When I opened the door, my son just went in and went for bath \[sic\]. At about 0800 hrs, he left the house and he told me that he will come back again.

> At about 1045 hrs, my son came to my unit again he knocked on the door and asked me to open the door as he need to come in \[sic\]. I told that I’m not going to open the door. Out of anger he toppled my plant outside and told me that he will burn down my house.

> After which he left. My son moved out of my unit since 6/7/17. I do not have my son contact number and I do not know his whereabouts. I have a PPO against my son however I am unable to recalled the case number. No injury on me \[sic\].

18     SI Celeste did not reflect the time the recording of the statement ended.

19     Despite the statement being shown and interpreted to her[^23], Mdm Ganthi maintained that she was unable to recall what the Accused had said to her on that day[^24]. Mdm Ganthi gave various reasons to explain why she was unable to recall what the Accused had said on 17 May 2018:

> (i)     the Accused had previously threatened to burn down the house[^25];

> (ii)     there were many episodes of misunderstanding between her and the Accused[^26];

> (iii)     she had a fall and her health and memory were not as before[^27];

> (iv)     in the past, the Accused had “burned the house”[^28]; and

> (v)     for many years, she was “always having this kind of problems”[^29].

20     Mdm Ganthi claimed that she was able to understand SI Celeste and that the statement was accurate. When questioned about her proficiency in English during cross-examination, she agreed that her command of English was poor.

### (c)   The evidence of the officers at the scene

#### (i)   SI Celeste Ang (PW2)

21     SI Celeste testified that she attended to the FIR with her colleague, Sergeant Hilmi Danial bin Abdullah (“Sgt Hilmi”), on 17 May 2018. At that time, she was a Senior Staff Sergeant attached to Bedok Police Division Headquarters (“Bedok Police HQ”). She said that they arrived at the scene at “around 11.40 am”[^30]. SI Celeste further testified that when they “arrived at the scene, \[they\] set of the lift \[sic\], \[they\] started a mess \[sic\]”[^31]. There was “broken flower pot”, and “soil all over the corridor”[^32]. There was no one outside the Unit[^33].

22     SI Celeste then knocked on the door of the Unit and interviewed Mdm Ganthi when Mdm Ganthi answered the door. After interviewing her, she contacted the Investigation Officer, Jason Ng, who then instructed her to record a statement from Mdm Ganthi and to take photographs of the scene[^34].

23     SI Celeste then proceeded to record a statement from Mdm Ganthi in English[^35]. She claimed that she and Mdm Ganthi could “communicate well”[^36].

24     SI Celeste was also asked by the Prosecution to comment whether the “wind could have caused … the mess” along the corridor[^37]. SI Celeste’s reply was[^38]:

> No, Because the flower pot actually, is, .., place it on the ground and the parapet is high and it’s unlikely is blow by the wind. And, .., I ---,it’s, …someone actually took it and smashed it on the floor. If --- because the broke --- flower pot pieces, it’s broken into pieces and scatter around the location --- I mean around the corridor.

> \[sic\]

25     In cross-examination, SI Celeste said that she arrived at the scene with her partner within 15 minutes[^39]. She confirmed that there were no broken windows[^40] and claimed that while she was recording Mdm Ganthi’s statement, Sgt Hilmi was “nearby \[her\] taking photographs of the scene”, and that he was next to her when the statement was “read through and explained to” Mdm Ganthi by her[^41]. She also testified that Sgt Hilmi went down to get the camera while she waited outside the Unit[^42].

26     SI Celeste was also asked why she had classified the offence as “breach of personal order” when she recorded Mdm Ganthi’s statement, and whether she had verified that there was indeed a valid PPO against the Accused[^43]. SI Celeste reply was – “The investigation was not done by me.”[^44]

27     SI Celeste further confirmed that she had previously dealt with the Accused, as she was the officer who attended to the Accused when the Accused lodged a report against his family on 13 January 2018[^45].

#### (ii)   Sgt Hilmi Danial bin Abdullah (PW3)

28     It was the evidence of Sgt Hilmi that he attended to the FIR with SI Celeste on 17 May 2018, and they arrived at the scene at about 11.40 am[^46]. He noticed that the area outside the Unit was messy and there was a flower pot which was broken into pieces[^47]. At 12.24 pm, he proceeded to take photographs of the scene[^48]. A total of five photographs were taken (P2:1-5). Sgt Hilmi further testified that he did not see the Accused on 17 May 2018[^49].

29     During cross-examination, Sgt Hilmi gave evidence that there were no broken windows at the scene[^50].

### (d)   The evidence of the Investigation Officer

30     The Investigation Officer was Sergeant (3) Jason Ng Hong Sim (“IO Jason”) (PW4). IO Jason testified that he first met the Accused on 8 June 2018 when he recorded a statement from the Accused at Bedok Police HQ[^51]. At that time, the Accused was under arrest by IO Jason’s colleagues for other incidents unrelated to the present case[^52].

31     IO Jason further testified that Mdm Ganthi did not have a valid PPO against the Accused as the PPO against the Accused was cancelled on 3 May 2017[^53].

## (3)   Close of Prosecution’s case

32     At the close of the Prosecution’s case, having considered the evidence adduced by the Prosecution, I found that the Prosecution had made out a case against the Accused by satisfying the requirements of section 230(1)(_j_) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”) and called on him to enter his defence for both the charges.

## (4)   The Defence

### (a)   The evidence of the Accused

33     The Accused chose to give evidence in his defence. He claimed that on 17 May 2018, he was eating at Foodfare with his supervisor, when he spotted Mdm Ganthi. He approached Mdm Ganthi and he told her that he would like to go to the Unit. Eventually, they took the lift to the 12th level and Mdm Ganthi then opened the door to the Unit. He went into the Unit, took his shower and left the Unit. He also informed Mdm Ganthi that he would return to the Unit after work[^54].

34     After leaving the Unit, the Accused then proceeded to Qbay Residence, where he was working as a security guard, to retrieve his belongings[^55]. By the time the Accused returned to the Unit, it was about 10.45 am. Mdm Ganthi did not allow him into the Unit. The Accused therefore took his “stuff from the floor”, his can of drink, and bid Mdm Ganthi goodbye[^56].

35     The Accused also suggested that Mdm Ganthi had called the police over the toppled plant and broken flower pot so that his brother would not be implicated[^57]. He further claimed that Mdm Ganthi could not have heard any commotion along the corridor if she was in her room, which was at the back of the Unit[^58].

36     The Accused denied telling Mdm Ganthi that he would burn her house down. He also denied breaking the flower pot and toppling the plant. When questioned on who could have toppled the plant and broken the flower pot, the Accused claimed that IO Jason could have planted the broken flower pot, and that the wind had toppled the plant[^59].

### (b)   The Accused’s statement

37     The Accused tendered his statement which he had given to IO Jason on 8 June 2018 at 9.30 am (D2). In the statement, the Accused stated that he saw Mdm Ganthi at Foodfare at about 7.30 am on 17 May 2018. He walked in front of Mdm Ganthi, as instructed by her. When they arrived at the Unit, he showered, took his clothes and left the Unit. Before leaving, he informed Mdm Ganthi that he would be going back to the Unit.

38     The Accused eventually returned to the Unit at about 8.30 am and sat outside. He sat there until about 10.00 am as he was waiting for his friend to who owed him money. He denied saying that he would burn down the house, and toppling the plant. He was talking to his friend on the phone telling him that he (the Accused) would go to his house and Mdm Ganthi could have misunderstood him.

39     However, the Accused claimed in court that the events that he narrated to IO Jason did not happen on 17 May 2018, but sometime after 17 May 2018[^60].

## (5)   Closing Submissions

### (a)   The Prosecution’s submissions

40     In relation to the criminal intimidation charge, the Prosecution submitted, _inter alia_, that Mdm Ganthi’s evidence in court ought to be substituted with the version in her statement (P3). In Mdm Ganthi’s statement, it was stated that when she refused to open the door for the Accused, the Accused, “out of anger”, told her that he would burn her house down.

41     As for the mischief charge, there was clear evidence from Mdm Ganthi’s testimony in court that the Accused had “broken” her flower pots”. Her evidence in court was consistent with her statement (P3) and corroborated by the evidence of SI Celeste and Sgt Hilmi.

42     The Prosecution further submitted, _inter alia_, that the Accused’s defence be rejected:

> (i)     Mdm Ganthi did not frame the Accused but was trying to protect the Accused;

> (ii)     there was no basis to suggest that IO Jason had planted the broken flower pot;

> (iii)     the Accused failed to raise, during his cross-examination of Mdm Ganthi, that Mdm Ganthi had misheard or misunderstood him;

> (iv)     the Accused’s claim that he was at Qbay Residence at the material time was an after-thought; and

> (v)     the Accused admitted in his statement (D2) that he was at the Unit on 17 May 2018.

### (b)   The Defence’s submissions

43     The Accused claimed, _inter alia_, that he was not around the vicinity of the Unit at the material time, and that the police failed to retrieve footages from the CCTVs in the vicinity which would have exonerated him. The Accused further submitted that broken the flower pot did not belong to Mdm Ganthi. With respect to the toppled plant, the Accused submitted that Mdm Ganthi had testified that it was caused by the wind, and that she did not see the Accused breaking or toppling her flower pots. The Prosecution had referred to Mdm Ganthi’s evidence that she had seen the Accused breaking her flower pots in the past, evidence which was prejudicial to the Accused.

44     In addition, the Accused submitted that Mdm Ganthi did not inform the police (based on the FIR) that the Accused had threatened her. Likewise, when her statement (P3) was taken by SI Celeste, she did not state that she was “threatened” by the Accused. The Accused highlighted that Mdm Ganthi had testified that if the Accused had in fact threatened her, she would have stated it in the FIR. There was also no evidence to suggest the presence of kerosene outside the Unit.

45     After the Defence has closed its case and the case was adjourned for parties to prepare submissions, the Accused submitted a series of photographs and videos, and argued that the photographs and videos corroborated his defence.

## (6)   My decision

### (a)   Joinder of charges

46     The Accused was charged for causing mischief by toppling and breaking Mdm Ganthi’s flower pots and threatening to burn down her house on 17 May 2018.

47     Section 134 of the the CPC states:

> **Trial for more than one offence**

> 134\. If, in one series of acts connected so as to form the same transaction, 2 or more offences are committed by the same person, then he may be charged with and tried at one trial for every such offence.

48     I was satisfied the criminal intimidation charge and the mischief charge were so connected that they formed the same transaction, and the Accused could be could be tried for both offences at one trial.

### (b)   Whether the Prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt

49     It is trite that the Prosecution has the burden of proving its case against an accused person beyond a reasonable doubt. In the present case, the Prosecution’s main witness for its case was Mdm Ganthi.

50     It was not disputed that the Accused was not at the scene when the police arrived at the Unit on 17 May 2018. It was also clear to me that Mdm Ganthi was reluctant to testify against the Accused. While she testified that the Accused had given her many problems in the past, she stopped short of saying, in court, that the Accused had toppled and broken her flower pots, and had threatened to burn her house down.

#### (i)   The mischief charge

51     In relation to the toppled plant, it was Mdm Ganthi’s evidence in court that the plant could have been toppled by the wind. It was her position that she did not see the Accused toppling the plant as she was inside the Unit, and the Accused was outside. She knew that the Accused was outside as she heard his voice. The FIR made no mention of the Accused’s toppling her plant, and only alleged that the Accused was breaking her window and her things.

52     Despite intense questioning by the Prosecution, Mdm Ganthi maintained her position that she did not see the Accused toppling her plant. Similarly, for the broken flower pot – Mdm Ganthi’s evidence was that she did not “see it with her own eyes” that the Accused had broken her flower pot. However, she gathered that it must be the Accused as she found that the flower pot was broken when the police arrived, and no one would “daringly” break her flower pots except the Accused[^61]. In addition, the Accused had broken her flower pots in the past[^62].

53     When SI Celeste arrived at the scene and recorded her statement about 45 minutes after the FIR was made, Mdm Ganthi made no mention of the Accused breaking her window and things, but reported something different instead – that the Accused had toppled her plant and uttered the threat.

54     I was not persuaded by the Prosecution’s submission that Mdm Ganthi’s evidence in court and her statement (P3) were sufficient to prove the mischief charge against the Accused. On this point, Mdm Ganthi was not a credible witness:

> (i)     Mdm Ganthi did not proffer any explanation for the difference in her allegations against the Accused – that she had reported in the FIR that the Accused was “breaking her window and things”; while she had told SI Celeste that the Accused had “toppled her plant” and threatened her.

> (ii)     When Mdm Ganthi was asked what she heard while she was inside the Unit, she said “I heard the sound of banging the gate, banging the door and banging the windows”. She further claimed that she called the police “after \[she\] heard the breaking of the window sound”. At no point did she give evidence that she heard the breaking of flower pots, nor did she mention in her statement to SI Celeste that the Accused had broken her flower pot. It was also undisputed that no windows were found to be broken by the police who attended the scene.

> (iii)     Between the time the FIR was made and the arrival of the police, there was a period of time which was unaccounted for. In addition, Mdm Ganthi had stated in her statement (P3) that the Accused left the Unit at 8.00 am and came back at about 10.45 am. Therefore, it could not be ruled out that there were other factors causing the plant to topple, other than the acts of the Accused. In fact, Mdm Ganthi had explained in court, during cross-examination, that she would tie the pots of plant together to prevent the plants from toppling when the wind was strong. However, for the toppled plant in P2:4, which was a curry plant, she had removed the string, as the string was constricting the growth of the plant. Therefore, it was possible that the wind had caused the plant to topple on that day.

> (iv)     Mdm Ganthi was unable to shed light on what could have taken place outside the Unit from the time the Accused left the Unit after his shower as she did not open the door or come out of the Unit, nor could she remember whether the Accused was still at the scene when the police arrived. Nonetheless, it was clear from the evidence of SI Celeste and Sgt Hilmi that the Accused was not at the scene when they arrived. If the Accused had been at the vicinity, SI Celeste would have recognised the Accused, having previously dealt with the Accused. Consequently, there was no evidence from the Prosecution on the state of the plants from about 8.00 am to the arrival of SI Celeste and Sgt Hilmi.

> (v)     While Mdm Ganthi said she “heard the sound of banging the gate, banging the door and banging the windows”, Mdm Ganthi did not mention in the two days that she was on the stand that she heard the breaking and toppling of flower pots.

55     The Prosecution also submitted that Mdm Ganthi had testified that the Accused had previously broken her flower pots. While the Prosecution did not cite any legislative provision or case law on this aspect of Mdm Ganthi’s evidence, the Prosecution was presumably relying on similar fact evidence to buttress Mdm Ganthi’s evidence.

56     Similar fact evidence is admissible under s 11(_b_) of the Evidence Act:

> 11.    Facts not otherwise relevant are relevant —

>> ….

>> (_b_)    if by themselves or in connection with other facts they make the existence or non-existence of any fact in issue or relevant fact highly probable or improbable.

57     While Mdm Ganthi’s allegations of the Accused’s previous acts may be used as corroborative evidence, I was of the view that it was of limited probative value given the inherent weakness in Mdm Ganthi’s evidence in court. In any event, even if I accepted that the Accused had previously broken Mdm Ganthi’s flower pots, this was insufficient to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the Accused had toppled her plant and broken her flower pot on 17 May 2018. I would add that it was not necessary for the defence to show how the flower pot was broken or prove an alternative explanation.

#### (ii)   The criminal intimidation charge

58     With respect to the criminal intimidation charge, Mdm Ganthi did not implicate the Accused in court and claimed that she had forgotten what the Accused had said to her on 17 May 2018 when she refused to open the door for him. The Prosecution therefore made an application to treat her as a hostile witness and to substitute her evidence in court with the relevant portions of her statement (P3).

59     I considered whether it was safe to convict the Accused on the criminal intimidation charge based purely on the statement (P3). Mdm Ganthi did not mention in the FIR that the Accused had threatened to burn her house down. The Prosecution submitted that the Accused could well have uttered the threat after Mdm Ganthi had called the Police.

60     Having considered the evidence before me, I did not think that it was safe to convict the Accused on the criminal intimidation charge based purely on Mdm Ganthi’s statement (P3):

> (i)     Mdm Ganthi was not conversant in English and relied on a Tamil interpreter in court. It was also clear from the FIR that she reported that the Accused was “breaking the window”, when it was not disputed that the windows to the Unit were not broken – this would mean that either Mdm Ganthi was not conversant in English or that she was inconsistent in her allegations against the Accused even on the day of the incident.

> (ii)     Further, Mdm Ganthi stated in her statement (P3) to SI Celeste that she had a PPO against the Accused when in fact that was not the case, as the PPO against the Accused had been cancelled in 2017. Her suggestion that she had a valid PPO against the Accused was likely why SI Celeste had classified the offence as “breach of PPO” when she recorded the statement from Mdm Ganthi. No explanation was given by Mdm Ganthi on why she had told SI Celeste that she had a PPO against the Accused when that was not true[^63]. It would therefore suggest either that Mdm Ganthi’s memory was poor, SI Celeste was unable to communicate properly with Mdm Ganthi in English, or Mdm Ganthi was not a truthful witness.

> (iii)     In court, Mdm Ganthi testified that the Accused had given her “this kind of problems” over the years, and she was therefore unable to recall specifically what the Accused had said to her on that day. She further testified that she called the police on that day, not because the Accused had threatened her, but because the Accused was making a lot of noise and she needed to sleep[^64].

61     Since the statement was recorded in English by SI Celeste without the assistance of a Tamil interpreter, I could not rule out the possibility of a miscommunication between Mdm Ganthi and SI Celeste. This is especially so as it was reflected in the statement (P3) that Mdm Ganthi had a PPO against the Accused on 17 May 2018, when that was in fact not the case. I therefore did not accept Mdm Ganthi’s claim that her statement (P3) to SI Celeste was accurate. Mdm Ganthi had also failed to give any explanation why she had reported in the FIR that the Accused was breaking her window, whereas there was no mention of it in the statement. This could be due to her poor command of English, her lack of truthfulness, or her being muddled about the facts.

62     The fact that Mdm Ganthi and the Accused shared a strained relationship could not be ignored – it was also clear that she had made many police reports against him in the past and had applied for a PPO and a DXO against him. While it was possible that Mdm Ganthi had called the police because the Accused did as alleged in the charges, it was equally possible that Mdm Ganthi had called the police that day with the intent that of having them stop the Accused from creating further noise and disturbing her sleep.

63     It was therefore not safe to rely on Mdm Ganthi’s statement (P3) alone to convict the Accused on the criminal intimidation charge, especially since Mdm Ganthi had maintained consistently in court that she was unable to recall if the Accused had uttered the threat on 17 May 2018. I could not rule out the possibility of a miscommunication between Mdm Ganthi and SI Celeste. More importantly, there were multiple material inconsistencies between Mdm Ganthi’s evidence in court[^65], the FIR and her statement (P3). Notably, the FIR and the statement were made within about 45 minutes of each other, and there were irreconcilable material differences in both the documents.

### (c)   The Defence’s inadequacies

64     I rejected the Accused’s allegation that his statement (D2) was inaccurately recorded by IO Jason, and that IO Jason had planted the broken flower pot. I found the allegations spurious and unsupported by objective evidence.

65     I agreed with the Prosecution that the Accused had failed to confront Mdm Ganthi in cross-examination on certain aspects of his defence which was raised by the Accused when he was on the stand. While the rule in _Browne v Dunn_ (1893) 6 R 67 would apply to the Accused in the present case, I accorded some latitude to the Accused as he was in person and did not hold him strictly to the rule in _Browne v Dunn_.

66     However, even if I gave latitude to the Accused in the way he conducted his defence, I agreed with the Prosecution that the Accused’s defence was tenuous and unmeritorious. While there were inadequacies in the defence, the burden still lay on the Prosecution to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, as stated in the case of _Tan Edmund v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] 1 SLR(R) 618</span> and cited in _Jayasekara Arachchilage Hemantha Neranjan Gamini v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 3 SLR 689</span> by Steven Chong J (as he then was):

> 73    In addition to the above, the District Judge disbelieved the appellants’case that the victims had operated as pimps, and that the appellants were framed by PW1 and PW2 due to a prior dispute over Nirasha. ... However, it is accepted that even if the Defence’s case was **_disbelieved_** by the trial judge, it remained **_imperative_** for the Prosecution to discharge its burden of proving its own case beyond a reasonable doubt. This was emphasised in the Magistrate’s Appeal decision of _Teo Keng Pong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 2 SLR(R) 890</span> (at \[67\]):

>> ... It is pertinent to note that she made a finding that it was, before proceeding to examine the defence evidence. _This showed that the magistrate was aware that even if the Defence’s evidence was disbelieved, the onus was first and foremost on the Prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt._ The magistrate said that she was convinced that the Prosecution’s evidence represented the truth. This was simply another way of saying that she had no reasonable doubt. \[emphasis added\]

> Indeed, similar observations were made in _Sahadevan_ (\[40\] _supra_ at \[35\]):

>> … the burden of proof was still on the Prosecution to prove the appellant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, _however tenuous the defence might have been_ … \[emphasis added\]

> It was also observed in _Tan Edmund v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] 1 SLR(R) 618</span> that (at \[15\]):

>> There is no need to deal in minute detail with the defence of the appellant; for however tenuous that defence might have been, the burden still lay on the Prosecution to prove the appellant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt, and in discharging that burden, it was insufficient for them to point to the inadequacies of the appellant’s or their witnesses’ testimonies.

> 74    As such, _even if_ the District Judge was to disbelieve the appellants’ case that the victims had operated as pimps and that they had framed the appellants due to a dispute over Nirasha, the onus was, first and foremost, on the Prosecution to establish the charge beyond a reasonable doubt. As already shown above, the Prosecution has significantly failed to adduce evidence of the alleged injuries and failed to provide material corroborative evidence. It was also shown that there were irreconcilable doubts about the credibility of PW1’s and PW2’s evidence in view of the inherently incredulous aspects of their accounts. …

> …

> 75    On the basis of the evidence before the court, Yong CJ in _Sahadevan_ held that the conviction was unsafe and set aside the conviction and the sentence. He stressed that “\[i\]n discharging this burden, it was not at all sufficient for the Prosecution to merely point to the inadequacies of the appellant’s testimony”.

## (7)   Conclusion

67     In the present case, I was of the view that the standard of proof for conviction had not been met, and it would not be safe to convict the Accused based on the evidence presented by the Prosecution. In the circumstances, I acquitted the Accused.

68     In acquitting the Accused, I did not place any reliance on the photographs and/or videos which were submitted by the Accused after the close of the defence case.

However, in the afternoon, she changed her evidence and said that the Accused had “sneaked into the house” (pg 43, \[25\]).
