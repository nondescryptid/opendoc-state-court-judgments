### District Judge Soh Tze Bian:

## CHARGE

1       The accused person (“AP”) claimed trial to the following charge:

> “…you, on 14 February 2019, at or about 5.07p.m., at Thomson Plaza Taxi Stand located at 301 Upper Thomson Road, Singapore 574408, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Gui Eng Chew, _to wit_, by pushing his upper body several times and kicking his thigh once, causing him to suffer from tenderness over the chest wall, left shoulder and left forearm, with intention of causing hurt to him and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).”

2       Section 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) states that: “Whoever, except in the case provided for by section 334, voluntarily causes hurt, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine which may extend to $5,000, or with both.

## PROSECUTION’S CASE

3       To prove its case against the AP, the prosecution called 5 witnesses and tendered a list of exhibits as follows:

## CLOSE OF THE PROSECUTION’S CASE

4       At the close of the prosecution’s case, I was satisfied that there was some evidence not inherently incredible which satisfied each and every element of the 3 charges preferred against the AP. Accordingly, I administered the standard allocution to the AP who elected to give evidence in his own defence.

## ISSUES FOR DETERMINATION

5       At the end of the trial, I directed both parties to file their respective written submissions and replies on the following issues:

> “1    Based on the evidence adduced at the trial in respect of the charge preferred against the AP:

>> (a)    What are the undisputed and disputed facts in the present case? (**Issue 1(a)**)

>> (b)    Whether the victim, PW4, is a credible and truthful witness, and why? (**Issue 1(b)**)

>> (c)    Whether the AP is a credible and truthful witness, and why? (**Issue 1(c)**)

>> (d)    What is the AP’s defence to the charge, and has the AP raised a reasonable doubt in the prosecution’s case, and why? (**Issue 1(d)**)

>> (e)    Whether the prosecution has established its case against the AP beyond a reasonable doubt, and why? (**Issue 1(e)**)

> 2    In the event that the AP is convicted of the charge preferred against based on the evidence adduced at the trial :

>> (a)    What are the sentencing considerations as well as the aggravating and mitigating factors to be taken into account by the court in sentencing the AP for the offence? (**Issue 2(a)**)

>> (b)    What is the appropriate sentence to be imposed on the AP, and why? (**Issue 2(b)**)”

### Issue 1(a) : What are the undisputed and disputed facts in the present case?

6       Based on the evidence presented at the trial and the submissions and replies of both parties, the undisputed facts[^1] are as follows:

> (a)     The incident occurred on Thursday, February 14, 2019 at the Thomson Plaza taxi stand between the AP and PW4.

> (b)     The dispute between the AP and PW4 began inside the taxi.

> (c)     PW4 wanted the AP to alight from the taxi.

> (d)     All of the prosecution exhibits, including the CCTV footage, the victim’s (PW4) medical reports, and the AP’s statement, were admitted by consent.

> (e)     The sequence of events are undisputed and have also been captured on CCTV footage.

> (f)     On 14 February 2019 at about 5.07 p.m., after a disagreement between PW4 and the AP, PW4 had driven his taxi back to Thomson Plaza taxi stand to drop off the AP and his son. When PW4 pointed his finger at the AP and asked him to alight from his taxi, the AP responded by pushing PW4’s hand away before exiting the vehicle. The AP had admitted to pushing PW4 four times and kicking him twice[^2].

> (g)     Thereafter, the AP tried to leave the scene by boarding another taxi with his son, but PW4 prevented the other taxi from leaving. The AP and his son then left the scene on foot before the police arrived.[^3]

> (h)     During PW4’s initial medical examination conducted by PW8 on 15 February 2019 at the Emergency Department of Tan Tock Seng Hospital, PW4 was found to be suffering from tenderness over his chest wall, left shoulder, and left forearm.[^4] PW8 issued PW4 a one-day medical certificate.[^5] During PW4’s subsequent medical examination conducted by PW6 on 26 February 2019 at Tai Seng Clinic, PW4 was found to have a 4 cm-long healing abrasion on his lateral right calf.[^6] PW6 also issued PW4 with a one-day medical certificate.[^7]

7       The disputed facts are as follows:

> (a)     Whether PW4 was first to exhibit aggressive behaviour as seen on video?

> (b)     Whether the AP was obstructed by PW4, as he attempted to exit the taxi and throughout the situation?

> (c)     Whether obstruction by PW4 continued on throughout the incident, even as the AP was leaving to engage another taxi?

> (d)     When the AP pushed PW4 two more times in the chest causing PW4 to step back, and as PW4 then walked to the boot of the taxi and the AP pushed him in the chest another time causing PW4 to step back again, what was the number of steps taken by PW4?

> (e)     While the AP was reaching into the boot to remove his belongings and PW4 made contact with_[^8]_ the AP’s upper arm, what is the nature of the contact[^9] made between PW4 and the AP?

> (f)     Who ripped the plastic shopping bags containing the AP’s belongings? [^10]

> (g)     Whether the AP made any contact with PW4 on his right leg (calf) and cause injury to PW4?

> (h)     Whether the AP departed from Thomson Plaza with his child (who has special needs) at the earliest possible opportunity for the sake of the child and to deescalate the situation?

> (i)     Whether the events that transpired inside the taxi led to the dispute between the AP and PW4?

> (j)     What is the purpose/intention/degree of the force used by the AP on PW4?

### Issue 1(b) : Whether the victim, PW4, is a credible and truthful witness, and why?

8       I agreed with the prosecution submissions[^11] and rejected the defence submissions[^12] and I found that PW4 is a credible and truthful witness for the following reasons:

> (a)     It is settled law that _“Discrepancies and contradictions there inevitably would be, but if these be not of such nature as to impair the strength of the prosecution case or to detract from the value of the witnesses’ testimony, then they ought to be disregarded_.”[^13] In the present case, I found that the discrepancies and contradictions in PW4’s testimony (as submitted by the defence) are not of such nature as to impair the strength of the prosecution case in the light of the CCTV evidence, the evidence of the other prosecution witnesses, including the medical evidence, and the AP’s admissions adduced at the trial.

> (b)     In my view, the following defence submissions and attempts to discredit PW4 must fail because they are rather inconsequential and no substantial arguments turned on them so as to assist the defence case:

>> (i)       PW4 was not afraid during the incident and had pointed his finger at the AP[^14] despite testifying that he had “never pointed finger in his life”. PW4, in his aggressive and argumentative state (as perceived by the AP), could not have possibly said "please" to the AP in a "kind" manner when he testified that he “opened the door for him (the AP) to step out of the door..”[^15] and told the AP that he "was rushing home to feed his (my) children, so please take the taxi behind"[^16]. PW4 was trying to give the impression to the Court that he was calm throughout the whole situation.

>> (ii)       PW4 had wrongly alleged that the AP kept punching him with both hands, closed fist, as the CCTV timestamps 17:07:28 and 17:07:38 show that the AP was merely pushing PW4 and it was undisputed that the AP did not punch PW4. PW4 was mistaken when he told PW6 that he was punched a few times on his hands and both sides of his chest and PW4 would have sustained more severe injuries than the medical evaluation given by PW8.

>> (iii)       I agreed with the prosecution[^17] that the sheer force behind the AP’s kicks is apparent in the CCTV footage,[^18] and the defence has mischaracterised PW4’s testimony about how he felt after the AP’s two kicks to support the defence case that PW4 is not a credible witness.[^19] When asked to clarify what he meant by “_don’t feel like nothing_”, PW4 had explained that he felt nervous and frightened after being kicked by the AP, and that his chest was also more painful than his leg.[^20] As for PW8’s testimony about how PW4 did not complain about pain in his lower limbs and why she did not examine him there[^21], this is consistent with PW4’s explanation that he forgot he had been kicked by the AP.[^22] PW4 had testified that the AP had “_used all his strength_”[^23] to kick him as PW4’s evidence that he “felt nothing” with “no other pain anywhere else” was consistent with PW8’s medical evidence that PW4 “ _had no issue with his gait_” upon PW4’s arrival at Tan Tock Seng on 15 Feb 2019, and also consistent with PW6’s medical evidence that PW4 was found to have a 4cm-long healing abrasion on his lateral right calf when PW4 went to see PW6 on 26 Feb 2019. The AP did not dispute the accuracy of either PW8’s or PW6’s findings in this regard.

>> (iv)       As regards the issue of whether the cut and abrasion on PW4’s leg was caused by the AP, the prosecution had conceded[^24] that it is not clear beyond reasonable doubt that the 4 cm-long healing abrasion was caused by the AP as PW4 had forthrightly acknowledged that he was unsure whether the AP had caused his leg injury, stating that the injury was “likely” caused by the AP because he did not remember being hit in his leg during the intervening time.[^25] Similarly, while PW6 was able to give evidence on the nature of the injury and assessed that it was not inconsistent with PW4’s account of being kicked by the AP[^26], PW6 would also not be able to definitively ascertain that PW4’s leg injury had been caused by the AP.

>> (v)       In this regard, I rejected the defence submission[^27] on PW4's credibility that _“when the AP had kicked PW4, he testified that he felt nothing. In all probability the cut and abrasion could not have been caused by the AP. The Court needs to consider PW8's testimony who testified that when PW4 came to see her, he was walking normally and he "had no issue with his gait". This goes to show that PW4 is not credible at all.”_

### Issue 1(c) : Whether the AP is a credible and truthful witness, and why?

9       I agreed with the prosecution and rejected the defence submissions[^28] and I found that the AP is not a credible and truthful witness for the following reasons:

> (a)     As submitted by the prosecution, the AP’s inconsistent and evolving account shows that he is an unreliable witness as explained below:

>> (i)       In his statement to PW5, the AP admitted to shoving PW4 in the chest two or three times because he did not like PW4’s attitude.[^29] However, the AP then changed his account on stand in order to justify his use of violence, claiming that he had been trying to protect his son[^30] and that PW4 had been obstructing his way[^31].

>> (ii)       The AP said in his statement that he had kicked PW4 twice in order to “create a distance” for himself and his son.[^32] However, since the CCTV footage shows that his son was nowhere close to both of them when the AP kicked PW4, the AP again changed his account on stand and claimed that he had been reacting to PW4 “grabbing” his arm and his belongings.[^33] On this issue of whether PW4 was “grabbing” the AP as raised by the defence, I accepted the prosecution submission[^34] that based on the CCTV footage, the contact could at most be described as PW4 holding onto the AP’s elbow without a forceful grip which “grabbing” (as contended by the defence) would connote.

>> (iii)       By citing differing reasons for his violent behaviour and changing those accounts when confronted with contradictory evidence, the AP has shown himself to be an unreliable witness.

>> (iv)       In this regard, I rejected the defence denial[^35] that the _“AP has never changed his account on the stand in order to justify what he did. He claims that he was trying to distance himself and his son. In reference to his written statement to the police, the AP emphasized clearly that he was only trying to create a distance for himself and his son. This is entirely consistent with his testimony in Court.”_

> (b)     I was unable to accept the defence submissions that the AP is a credible and truthful witness. In the face of the CCTV evidence and his statement to PW5, the AP could not deny that he had pushed or kicked PW4. I rejected the defence explanation[^36] for the AP’s aforesaid non-denial as afterthoughts not to be believed and relied upon as evidence to support the defence case because:

>> (i)       The AP’s claim of trying to protect his son and that PW4 had been obstructing his way were afterthoughts not specifically mentioned in his statement to PW5. There was nothing in the AP’s statement to PW5 to show that the AP’s son was in danger and in need of protection and that the AP’s _“\[p\]rotection of his son was of paramount importance at the material time[^37]_.” PW4’s acts of pointing his fingers at the AP and yelling at the AP to get out of the taxi as well as “grabbing” the AP on his upper left arm and also his black backpack kept in the taxi boot which led to PW4 “ripping” apart the AP's plastic shopping bags and causing the groceries to fall apart, did not and could not, in my view, justify the AP’s act of pushing and kicking the AP as the defence has failed to establish that the AP has a right to private defence or that grave and sudden provocation applies as a partial defence to the charge preferred against him, as explained under **Issue 1(d)** below. Further, as pointed out by the prosecution[^38], the defence has sought to characterise an incident with the AP’s torn grocery bags as PW4 “ripping”/”tearing” the plastic bags apart,[^39] but this is not an accurate depiction of the incident which took place after the AP had already committed an offence and the AP himself had also conceded during cross-examination that the bags had ripped because both parties were pulling them.[^40]

>> (ii)       The AP was clearly seeking to evade the arm of the law when he ignored the advice of the security supervisor, PW7, to wait until the police arrived, while telling PW7 to fuck off.[^41] The AP had left the scene soon after the incident occurred and did not of his own volition leave any identification details with PW4 or the security officers. I accepted PW7’s evidence that he had told the AP not to leave the premises as “the SPF was already activated”[^42] and the case _“is on SPF assistance_”[^43] which the AP ignored[^44]. Given the AP’s violent acts committed towards PW4, PW7 and other security guards were waiting for the police to arrive to deal with the AP and obtain his identification details, and they could not stop the AP from leaving the scene for obvious reasons, and PW7 had also testified that the security guards “have no warrant to enforce”[^45]. As a result of his actions, the police had to expend significant resources to track him down over a period of one month.[^46]

>> (iii)       In this regard, I rejected the defence submission[^47] that someone should have asked the AP for his particulars who was not fleeing from the scene, but attempting to protect his son and get out of the situation for his son's safety, and that after the whole incident, he had visited Thomson Plaza a couple of times and had also been seen by PW7. This is because the AP’s identity took time to be ascertained by the police and PW7 was not involved in the police investigations to ascertain his identity. As for the AP’s overseas travels after police investigations had commenced against him, he is presumed innocent unless proven guilty in a court of law under our legal system. Hence, it is legally open to him to view the case as a minor matter and travel overseas and then return to work and live in Singapore where he and his family have been living, but it is for the Public Prosecutor under our legal system to decide whether to prosecute him for the matter and his view is irrelevant.

> (c)     In my view, as a well-educated person working as a teacher in an international school in Singapore, the AP ought to have known the seriousness of committing acts of violence against PW4 who was a taxi driver and belonged to the vulnerable class of public transport workers. He ought of his own volition to have either waited for police arrival, or volunteered to furnish his identity and other particulars to PW4 as the victim, or the security guards at Thomson Plaza before leaving the scene. If the AP had behaved in a civilised manner and told PW4 that he would leave his taxi after taking his belongings without ever pushing and kicking him, or of his own volition, exchange particulars with PW4, or leave his particulars with the security guards at Thomson Plaza after the incident, he could either have prevented, de-escalated or defused the incident.

### Issue 1(d) : What is the AP’s defence to the charge, and has the AP raised a reasonable doubt in the prosecution’s case, and why?

#### Whether the AP has the intention to cause hurt towards PW4

10     The defence has admitted that the AP did voluntarily cause hurt to PW4.[^48] Having considered the submissions[^49] of both parties, I rejected the defence submission that the AP did not have the intention to cause hurt towards PW4 for the following reasons:

> (a)     As submitted by the prosecution, the defence reason cited for the AP’s lack of intention is an event that happened after the AP had already committed the offence (i.e. the AP gathering his belongings from the ground and leaving)[^50], and this cannot go towards proving or disproving the AP’s intention when committing the offence.

> (b)     As I had found under **Issue 1(c)** above, PW4’s acts of pointing his fingers at the AP and yelling at the AP to get out of the taxi as well as “grabbing” the AP on his upper left arm and also his black backpack kept in the taxi boot which led to PW4 “ripping” apart the AP's plastic shopping bags and causing the groceries to fall apart did not and could not, in my view, justify the AP’s act of pushing and kicking the AP as the defence has failed to establish that the AP has a right to private defence or that grave and sudden provocation applies as a partial defence to the charge preferred against him, as explained below.

> (c)     As pointed out by the prosecution[^51], the defence had sought to characterise an incident with the AP’s torn grocery bags as PW4 “ripping”/”tearing” the plastic bags apart,[^52] but this is not an accurate depiction of the incident which took place after the AP had already committed an offence and the AP himself had also conceded during cross-examination that the bags had ripped because both parties were pulling them.[^53]

> (d)     As I had found under **Issue 1(c)** above, the AP was clearly seeking to evade the arm of the law when he ignored the advice of the security supervisor, PW7, to wait until the police arrived, while telling PW7 to fuck off. The AP had left the scene soon after the incident occurred and did not of his own volition leave any identification details with PW4 or the security officers. I accepted PW7’s evidence that he had told the AP not to leave the premises as “the SPF was already activated”[^54] and the case _“ is on SPF assistance_”[^55] which the AP ignored[^56]. Given the AP’s violent acts committed towards PW4, PW7 and other security guards were waiting for the police to arrive to deal with the AP and obtain his identification details, and they could not stop the AP from leaving the scene for obvious reasons, and PW7 had also testified that the security guards “have no warrant to enforce”[^57]. PW4 was not instigating a fight towards the AP first as under the aforesaid circumstances, it was justified for PW4 to behave in such an aggressive and argumentative way towards the AP (as perceived by the AP) to try to stop him from walking away from the situation and trying to engage another taxi before the police arrived.

> (e)     As for the defence submission that PW4 claimed he had been punched instead of pushed[^58], the sheer forcefulness of the AP’s individual pushes and kicks on PW4 could easily have given rise to PW4’s mistaken impression that he had been punched instead of pushed.[^59] As submitted by the prosecution[^60], the forcefulness of the AP’s individual pushes and kicks on PW4, their cumulative effect, and the AP’s motivation for hurting PW4 since he did not like PW4’s attitude, clearly underscore his intention to cause hurt to PW4.

#### Whether the AP has a right to private defence

11     I accepted the prosecution submissions[^61] that the defence has failed to establish that the AP has a right to private defence[^62] for the following reasons:

> (a)     Two preconditions must be met before the right of private defence arises in respect of the accused’s own body: (i) The accused must have been the subject of an offence affecting the human body or must reasonably apprehend the commission of such an offence (“the first precondition”); and (ii) The accused must have attempted to seek help from the relevant public authorities if there was a reasonable opportunity for him to do so (“the second precondition”)[^63].

> (b)     On the first precondition:

>> (i)       the AP had failed to prove that PW4 as the victim had caused, or even threatened, any bodily injury to him or to his son before he pushed and kicked PW4. He confirmed under cross-examination that PW4 had not used any force towards him at any point in the taxi. Nor did PW4 use or threaten any force towards the AP after exiting the taxi, as the CCTV footage readily attests. Instead, PW4 simply told the AP to exit his taxi. While the AP claimed that PW4 had been obstructing his way out of the taxi, he also conceded that any obstruction from PW4 would contradict PW4’s express intention for him to alight from the taxi quickly.[^64] In short, PW4 had done nothing that would allow the AP to reasonably apprehend that he would be the subject of any offence affecting the human body. In this regard, I rejected the defence submissions[^65] that:” _As for the first precondition, even though PW4 had said to not have used any force against the AP, his threatening mannerisms say otherwise. As per the AP's testimony, he emphasized how PW4 "keeps coming at \[him\] " and that the AP did not "know what his intentions are" and that PW4 came close to \[him\] aggressively, it was clearly emphasized how the AP pushed PW4 "to gain some distance". It was wrong for the Prosecution to assume that PW4 did nothing at all, when his threatening mannerisms were clearly concerning the AP.”_

>> (ii)       The AP’s claim that he was protecting his son from PW4 is plainly an afterthought. Crucially, the AP made no specific mention of this in his statement to PW5. When cross-examined on this omission, the AP prevaricated, alleging that PW5 had not recorded everything he said.[^66] This claim is disingenuous as the AP’s statement was admitted by consent, and it was never put by the defence to PW5 that he had been remiss or inaccurate in his recording of the AP’s statement. In any event, the AP’s account of how he attempted to protect his son from PW4 is riddled with inconsistencies and should be disbelieved as explained under **Issue 1(c)** above.

>> (iii)       As submitted by the prosecution, PW4 pointing his finger at the AP and standing in front of the AP was not enough justification for the AP to “defend” himself by pushing and kicking PW4 as contended by the defence[^67]. While PW4 made physical contact with the AP at the boot of the taxi, that came after the AP had pushed him four times, and cannot justify the AP’s use of force. Further, the AP’s exaggerated account of PW4’s physical contact in this regard is contradicted by the CCTV footage, which showed that PW4 had simply touched him on his elbow in order to prevent him from leaving. The AP was compelled to embellish because he knew that PW4’s contact was innocuous with no evidence of injury or apprehension suffered or felt by the AP, and incapable of giving rise to any right of private defence.

> (c)     As for the second precondition, while the AP was aware of security officers present in the vicinity of Thomson Plaza taxi stand, he acknowledged that he never sought their assistance to deal with PW4[^68]. Considering that any violence had been one-sided on the AP’s part and PW4 never retaliated, the AP had ample time to seek help from the security officers if he truly felt that he had been in any danger of violence from PW4. Tellingly, the AP sought instead to flee the scene after attacking PW4, ignoring the advice of the security supervisor to wait until the police arrived, while telling the security supervisor to fuck off.[^69] This was not the act of a man justified in his conduct, but rather a guilty party seeking to evade the arm of the law. As pointed out by the prosecution[^70], the defence assertion that the AP “_could not have possibly been able to ask for assistance from security who were not present at the material time_”[^71] is expressly contradicted by the evidence of the security officer, PW2 who had given evidence that he had been stationed within 20 metres of the taxi stand and was close enough to see the AP kicked PW4.[^72] However, despite having reasonable opportunity to seek help from PW2, the AP chose to take matters into his own hands by kicking and pushing PW4 instead.

> (d)     In this regard:

>> (i)       I rejected the defence submission[^73] that “_when we review the CCTV footage from timestamp 17:07:22, when PW4 began pointing his finger towards the AP, to when the AP was about to leave, security was not present before PW4's actions. By the time the security officers arrived, the AP was already leaving the situation. He could not have possibly been able to ask for assistance for the security who wasn't present at the time. Assuming the security guard was present which is denied. There was never an opportunity for the AP to disengage from PW4. From the CCTV footage timestamped 17:07:50 to 17:08:02, the AP proceeded to head to the boot to take his belongings which is a form of disengagement, as he was trying to defuse the situation by attempting to walk away. However, PW4 kept blocking the AP's path and even blocked the boot of the taxi which his hand preventing the AP from leaving. This led the AP to push PW4, who was obstructing the AP at that point in time. Subsequently, PW4 did not back off and even ripped the AP's plastic shopping bags. PW4's attempt in preventing the AP from walking away and his actions shows his intended aggression towards the AP, and the AP's push was just an attempt to disengage himself from the situation.”_

>> (ii)       I was unable to accept the defence submission[^74] that _“After such an elaborate incident that took place on 14 February, it is almost impossible for the AP to have thought that he had evaded apprehension, especially with all the CCTV cameras around Thomson Plaza.”_

>> (iii)       I rejected the defence denial[^75] that “_the AP has never attempted to evade any apprehension nor did he attempt to flee. At the material time, the AP's main purpose was to alleviate the situation, not the apprehension, the two of which are separate. It is important to note that even after the AP had left the scene, he came back to the same place with his son for his weekly shopping and errands, as per PW7 's testimony. It does not make sense for the AP to come back with his son if his exit that day was an attempt to evade justice_”.

>> (iv)       I see no merit in the defence submission_[^76]_ that “_It is almost impossible for AP to have thought that he had evaded apprehension because the AP was always of the view that this was a minor incident and he did not want it to escalate further and the AP wanted "to live and let live”. PW5 also testified that PW4 told him that he did not want to pursue the matter. PW5 further testified that PW4 regarded it as a minor incident."_ As it is for the Public Prosecutor under our legal system to decide whether to charge the AP for the offence, the views of the AP and PW4 that this was a minor incident are clearly irrelevant.

> (e)     On PW4’s aggressive and argumentative behavior, as submitted by the defence[^77], I found that:

>> (i)       PW4 appeared aggressive and argumentative (as perceived by the AP) and had approached the AP to try to stop him from walking away from the situation and trying to engage another taxi before the police arrived.

>> (ii)       As the AP was trying to leave the scene soon after the incident occurred and did not of his own volition leave any identification details with PW4 or the security officers, PW4 could not back away and leave the matter to the private security guards as the AP was clearly seeking to evade the arm of the law when he ignored the advice of the security supervisor, PW7, to wait until the police arrived, while telling PW7 to fuck off.[^78] As testified by PW7, both PW4 and the AP were "heated with each other"[^79]. I accepted PW7’s evidence that he had told the AP not to leave the premises as “the SPF was already activated”[^80] and the case _“is on SPF assistance_”[^81] which the AP ignored[^82]. Given the AP’s violent acts committed towards PW4, PW7 and other security guards were waiting for the police to arrive to deal with the AP and obtain his identification details, and they could not stop the AP from leaving the scene for obvious reasons, and PW7 had also testified that the security guards “have no warrant to enforce”[^83].

>> (iii)       Under the aforesaid circumstances, it was justified for PW4 to behave in such an aggressive and argumentative way towards the AP (as perceived by the AP) to try to stop him from walking away from the situation and trying to engage another taxi before the police arrived. But this does not avail the AP of a right to self defence.

> (f)     In short, none of PW4’s acts would fulfil the first precondition of an offence affecting the human body, and the AP also failed to fulfil the second precondition by taking matters into his own hands instead of seeking help from the nearby security officers. Thus, having failed to meet both preconditions for the right of private defence, the AP is not entitled to the defence in the present case. In fact, if any right of private defence was applicable in this case, it would have arisen on the part of PW4 after the AP had started pushing and kicking him. Nonetheless, PW4 did not retaliate when faced with the AP’s violent behaviour, choosing instead to seek assistance from the security officers near the Thomson Plaza taxi stand. He displayed admirable restraint.

> (g)     Even if I have found that the right of private defence arose in the present case, the AP inflicted more harm than was necessary on the PW4. The intensity and duration of the AP ’s violence was intense and protracted. In response to PW4 pointing his finger at the AP, the AP pushed PW4’s finger away and thereafter pushed PW4 in the chest twice, even though PW4 did not retaliate to the initial pushes with any physical force.[^84] I agreed with the prosecution[^85] that from the CCTV footage, the resulting effect of the AP’s second and third pushes on PW4 are partially obscured by the pillar next to the taxi stand.[^86] While PW4 is seen moving backwards after being pushed, the number of steps he took is unclear. However, PW4 clearly took one step backwards after the AP’s first push,[^87] and PW4 also clearly took two steps backwards after the AP’s fourth push.[^88] Even if the defence contention that PW4 only took two steps backwards after being pushed by the AP is accepted by this court, PW4’s backward movement and the rocking of his entire body[^89] still support the prosecution case that the AP had put significant force behind his pushes. Accordingly, this would lead to the inference that the AP had intended to cause hurt to PW4.

> (h)     The AP conceded that PW4 was a rather large man[^90], and that he had “used force”[^91] when pushing PW4. As submitted by the prosecution, considering the amount of force behind the AP’s pushes, it would not be surprising that PW4 thought he was being punched[^92] and also felt pain in his chest when he rubbed it, as shown in the CCTV footages,[^93] which was, as found by PW8, that PW4 had some mild tenderness around the chest walls. In response to PW4 touching his arm and holding onto his belongings, the AP then kicked PW4 twice. Similarly, when reacting to PW4 touching his arm and holding onto his belongings, the AP also put considerable force behind his two kicks. PW4 had testified that the AP had “used all his strength”[^94] to kick him, which was a reasonable assumption given that the AP admitted that his kicks were “intended to get (PW4) to let go of \[the AP\] and \[his\] belongings.”[^95]The entire assault lasted more than 30 seconds.[^96]

> (i)     In this regard:

>> (i)       I rejected the defence submissions[^97] that “_that the CCTV footage shows PW4 took two steps back. It only goes to show that the AP was not using his full strength. If the AP was using full force on PW4, he would have ended up falling to the ground or stumbling back to such an extent that his balance was lost. The CCTV footage shows that this is clearly not the case from timestamp 17.07.27 to 17.07.38. It should also be noted that PW4 continues to close the distance between himself and the AP after every push, which were intended to create distance, as the AP has testified and which is noted in his police statement. The fact that PW4 kept coming forward, despite taking two steps back, shows that PW4 was not afraid of the AP, and any pain was evidently minimal at best.”_

>> (ii)       I see no merit in the defence submissions[^98] that _“…PW4 claimed that the AP "used all his strength" to kick PW4, \[this\] only goes to show how unreliable PW4 is in his testimony. PW8 testified that PW4 had no issue with his gait. PW4 told PW8 that there was "no pain anywhere else" on his body”._

>> (iii)       I could not accept the defence submissions_[^99]_ that _“The CCTV footage clearly shows PW4 was grabbing and not touching. In fact, when PW4 testified he claimed that he, "didn't grab him at all" and that he had "no body contact with him" verbatim as referenced in line 30 on day 1, page 86. On the one hand, PW4 stated that he was afraid and frightened of the AP. But on the other hand, PW4 was grabbing the AP's arm, his backpack and not letting go, before ripping the plastic bags that the AP was holding. Again, this goes towards PW4's credibility. PW4 also testified that, "in my life I never point finger" verbatim. Timestamped 17:07:22 and 17:07:26 shows PW4 clearly pointing aggressively towards the AP in a threatening manner. In fact, the Prosecution concedes that PW4 did point his finger at the AP.”_

> (j)     I agreed with the prosecution that the AP’s use of force was disproportionate to his stated aim of creating space between himself and PW4. The AP had every opportunity to disengage from his attacks after the initial push on PW4’s finger, but he failed to do so. Instead, the AP continued to inflict far more harm on PW4 than would have been necessary to protect himself from any self-perceived threat. The one-sided physical violence that the AP had inflicted on PW4 would count as “more harm than necessary” by any objective measure, thus invalidating any theoretical right of private defence for the AP. As submitted by the prosecution[^100], there is no discernible size difference between the AP and PW4 in the CCTV footage[^101], and even if there is such disparity, it is unclear why this factor alone, as submitted by the defence[^102], would make PW4 more threatening and justify the AP’s unilateral use of physical force against PW4. Hence, the AP has failed to prove that he was acting in the exercise of any right of private defence.

> (k)     In this regard:

>> (i)       I rejected the defence submissions[^103] that _PW4 "keeps coming at \[the AP\]" who “did not know what his intentions are" and that PW4 came close to \[the AP\], aggressively and the AP pushed PW4 "to gain some distance". It is wrong for the prosecution to assume that PW4 did nothing at all, when his threatening mannerisms were clearly aggressive towards the AP. Additionally, as pointed out by the prosecution, PW4 is bigger in size, which makes him all the more threatening.”_

>> (ii)       I see no merit in the defence submissions[^104] that _“The fact that PW4 is bigger in size matters, as he was using close proximity in an attempt to threaten and or intimidate the AP. PW4 kept coming close to the AP in an aggressive manner, which justifies the AP pushing PW4 away to gain some distance.”_

#### Whether the defence of grave and sudden provocation applies

12     The defence submission that PW4 was instigating a fight towards the AP first[^105] appeared to raise the defence of grave and sudden provocation which, if successfully proven, would apply as a partial defence to the s 323 charge, thus reducing it to a charge under s 334 of the Penal Code[^106] instead. I accepted the prosecution submissions[^107] that this defence is not made out on the facts in the present case for the following reasons:

> (a)     two distinct requirements must be met for grave and sudden provocation to apply: (i) It must be shown that the accused was deprived of self-control by the provocation (“the subjective test”); and (ii) the provocation must be grave and sudden, and it has to be determined whether an ordinary person of the same sex and age as the accused, sharing his characteristics as would affect the gravity of the provocation, would have been so provoked as to lose self-control (“the objective test”). An accused’s exceptional hot temper alone should not be taken to exonerate an exceedingly violent response.[^108]

> (b)     The subjective test cannot be satisfied as the alleged provocation did not even materialise in the present case. As explained above under the issue of right of private defence in relation to the 2 preconditions to be satisfied for the defence to apply, PW4 as the victim had not done anything that might be construed as sufficient provocation leading to the AP’s loss of his self-control and use of violence. Crucially, the AP neither testified that he had lost self-control, nor put to PW4 that the latter had offered him any provocation. There is therefore no evidential basis for the court to find that the subjective test was satisfied.

> (c)     Even if the alleged provocation existed, and the subjective test made out, the AP would still not be able to satisfy the objective test. As explained under the issue of the right to private defence in relation to the AP inflicting more harm than was necessary on PW4 above, no reasonable person sharing the AP’s characteristics would have responded to PW4’s actions with violence of similar intensity and duration. Crucially, the Court in _Pathip[^109]_ also observed that an accused’s exceptional hot temper alone should not be taken to exonerate an exceedingly violent response. Hence, even if the AP had resorted to violence due to self-perceived provocations from PW4, such behaviour cannot be excused on account of even an exceedingly sensitive temperament.

> (d)     As pointed out by the prosecution[^110], PW4 pointing his finger and standing in front of the AP and continuously walking towards him, as well as “grabbing” the AP’s elbow from his blind side would not constitute grave and sudden provocation by any reasonable measure. I agreed with the prosecution[^111] that the incident needs to be viewed in the context of the AP having already pushed PW4 four times by this point[^112], and having been the aggressor throughout and having first initiated physical contact with PW4[^113], the AP cannot now claim that PW4’s touching of his elbow in the middle of the altercation led to him losing control and initiating physical contact in the first place. Further, the “ripping” of the grocery bags occurred after the AP had already committed an offence and happened because both parties were pulling them, as the AP himself had conceded during cross-examination, and it would, in my view, have no bearing on considerations of grave and sudden provocation.

> (e)     In this regard:

>> (i)       I could not accept the defence submissions_[^114]_ that “_the AP only used force as a result of PW4's actions, namely the pointing of his finger and continuous aggressive mannerisms towards the AP, namely walking towards the AP and using his size and close proximity in an attempt to threaten and/or intimidate the AP. PW4 kept pointing his fingers at the AP (Lines 14 to 26, day 2 page 49). PW4 then yelled at the AP to get out of the taxi. PW4 then_, **_"just kept coming and kept provoking" the AP_** _(line 9 to 1 0, day 2 page 2), even when the AP pushed PW4's hands away. PW4 kept coming back at the AP, so the AP had no choice to push him back to create some distance between them and to get him out the way. Then unexpectedly PW4 moved unexpectedly beside the AP in his blind spot and grabbed the AP's upper left arm.”_

>> (ii)       I rejected the defence assertions[^115] that _“There was a_ **_sudden provocation_** _when PW4 came into the AP's blind spot and “grabbed” his upper left arm at 17:07:57 of the CCTV footage. This shocked the AP, which caused the AP to spontaneously react by kicking PW4. It is important to note that this was not a premeditated move, and that the AP only acted instinctively towards PW4, which justifies the_ **_sufficient provocation_** _leading to the AP's loss of self-control”._

>> (iii)       I see no merit in the defence submissions [^116] that: _“…this Defence is made out on the facts of the present case as PW4's actions notably show him coming into the AP's blind spot and clearly grabbing his upper left arm at 17:07:57 of the CCTV footage. This instinctively caused the AP to spontaneously react by kicking PW4. It is important to note that this was not a premeditated move, which clearly justifies_ **_the sufficient provocation leading to the AP's loss of self-control_**_.”_

> (f)     In my view, all the aforesaid defence assertions and submissions do not satisfy the above two distinct requirements that must be met for grave and sudden provocation to apply to the present case based on my findings under **Issue 1(c) to Issue 1(d)** above.

### Issue 1(e) : Whether the prosecution has established its case against the AP beyond a reasonable doubt, and why?

13     I accepted the prosecution submissions[^117] and rejected the defence submissions[^118] and I found that the prosecution has established its case against the AP beyond a reasonable doubt for the following reasons:

> (a)     To establish the s 323 charge, the prosecution must show that:

>> (i)       The AP caused hurt to PW4 as the victim; and

>> (ii)       The AP did so with the intention of causing hurt to PW4 or with the knowledge that hurt to PW4 was likely to result.

> (b)     It is undisputed in the present case that:

>> (i)       the AP caused hurt to PW4 as the victim by pushing and kicking him.

>> (ii)       the AP had pushed and kicked PW4 multiple times during the incident as the AP had admitted to pushing PW4 four times and kicking him twice[^119].

>> (iii)       the AP’s pushes and kicks had caused PW4 to suffer bodily pain. PW4 testified that he had felt pain after being pushed by the AP[^120], and this was later verified by PW8’s medical report[^121]. While PW4 had testified that he had felt numb immediately after being kicked by the AP as his chest was hurting more from the AP’s pushes[^122], he later complained of pain in his leg and was examined by PW6[^123]. The AP did not dispute the accuracy of either PW8’s or PW6’s findings in this regard.

>> (iv)       The defence had admitted in its submission[^124] that the AP did voluntarily cause hurt to PW4.

> (c)     There is no reasonable doubt that the AP intended to cause hurt to PW4 when he pushed and kicked him based on the following facts and circumstances:

>> (i)       The obvious inference to be drawn from the forcefulness of the individual pushes and kicks is that the AP intended to cause hurt to PW4 as the victim. As I have found, under **Issue 1(d)** above, the CCTV footage shows PW4 clearly took one step backwards after the AP’s first push[^125], and also clearly took two steps backwards after the AP’s fourth push.[^126] Such PW4’s backward movement and the rocking of his entire body[^127] still support the prosecution case that the AP had put significant force behind his pushes. This would thus lead to the inference that the AP had intended to cause hurt to PW4. The AP conceded that PW4 was a rather large man[^128], and that he had _“used force_”[^129] when pushing PW4. In fact, considering the amount of force behind the AP’s pushes, it would not be surprising that PW4 thought he was being punched.[^130] Similarly, when reacting to PW4 touching his arm and holding onto his belongings, the AP also put considerable force behind his two kicks. PW4 had testified that the AP had “_used all his strength_”[^131] to kick him, which was a reasonable assumption given that the AP admitted that his kicks were _“intended to get (PW4) to let go of \[the AP\] and \[his\] belongings.”_[^132]

>> (ii)       I agreed with the prosecution[^133] that the sheer force behind the AP’s kicks is apparent in the CCTV footage,[^134] and the defence has mischaracterised PW4’s testimony about how he felt after the AP’s two kicks.[^135] When asked to clarify what he meant by “don’t feel like nothing”, PW4 had explained that he felt nervous and frightened after being kicked by the AP, and that his chest was also more painful than his leg.[^136] As for PW8’s testimony about how PW4 did not complain about pain in his lower limbs and why she did not examine him there[^137], this is consistent with PW4’s explanation that he forgot he had been kicked by the AP.[^138] PW4 had testified that the AP had “used all his strength”[^139] to kick him as PW4’s evidence that he “felt nothing” with “no other pain anywhere else” was consistent with PW8’s medical evidence that PW4 “ had no issue with his gait” upon PW4’s arrival at Tan Tock Seng on 15 Feb 2019 , and also consistent with PW6’s medical evidence that PW4 was found to have a 4cm-long healing abrasion on his lateral right calf when PW4 went to see PW6 on 26 Feb 2019. The AP did not dispute the accuracy of either PW8’s or PW6’s findings in this regard, although the prosecution had conceded[^140] that it is not clear beyond reasonable doubt that the 4cm-long healing abrasion was caused by the AP. Crucially, the AP also conceded that his pushes and kicks had caused pain to PW4, although he disputed the extent of the pain caused to PW4[^141].

>> (iii)       As pointed out by the prosecution[^142], given that the relevant hurt element in the current s 323 charge is framed with reference to the tenderness over PW4’s chest wall, left shoulder and left forearm, it is unclear how PW4’s lack of severe injuries like external bruising, swelling or open wounds would assist the AP’s case. Even if the defence observation[^143] that PW4 took two steps back after being pushed by the AP is accepted by this Court, this essentially concedes the point on the forcefulness of the pushes and is consistent with the AP ’s own admission during cross-examination that he had used enough force to cause the fairly big-sized PW4’s entire body to rock backwards[^144].

>> (iv)       In this regard, I rejected the defence submissions[^145] that _“PW4's lack of severe injuries…illustrates that the AP never engaged, "with all his strength", intending to hurt PW4 in the first place. The AP was at all times acting in self-defence, and doing whatever was necessary to disengage and deescalate the situation.”_ I agreed with the prosecution[^146] that given the sheer amount of force used by AP in pushing and kicking PW4 and the clear resulting effect on AP’s body, the defence assertion that the AP “never deliberately wanted to hurt or injure”[^147] PW4 rings hollow, and the AP had failed to establish his right to self-defence, as explained under **Issue 1(d)** above.

>> (v)       The AP’s repeated pushes and kicks, looked at cumulatively, simply underscored this intention. The AP pushed PW4 four times from the rear door of the taxi to the boot, and thereafter kicked PW4 twice more at the boot. The AP’s sustained assault on PW4 gives lie to his claim that he was simply trying to get past PW4, or to get PW4 to step aside. His actions were clearly calculated to cause hurt to PW4.

>> (vi)       The AP had ample motive to cause hurt to PW4. He admitted that he did not like PW4’s attitude. The AP said that he did not like the way that PW4 had acted in the taxi prior to the incident.[^148] In his statement to PW5, the AP also said, _“I didn’t like the way he got into my grille and his attitude, I then gave him a shove in the chest, probably two or three times._”[^149] He was essentially unhappy that PW4 refused to convey him to his destination, and gave vent to his unhappiness by lashing out at PW4. In this regard, I rejected the defence submission[^150] that the AP was not unhappy with PW4’s attitude.

> (d)     For the aforesaid reasons, I rejected the defence submission that the AP did not have the intention to cause hurt towards PW4. That the AP _"did not hit, punch, or even tackle \[PW4\] during the incident_"[^151] does not, in my view, mean that AP’s repeated pushes and kicks were not intended to hurt PW4. As I have found under **Issue 1(d)** above, under the circumstances of the present case, it was justified for PW4 to behave in such an aggressive and argumentative way towards the AP (as perceived by the AP) to try to stop him from walking away from the situation and trying to engage another taxi before the police arrived and PW4 never instigated a fight towards the AP.

> (e)     As explained under **Issue 1(c)** above, the AP’s claim of trying to protect his son was an afterthought not specifically mentioned in his statement to PW5. While the CCTV footage clearly shows that the AP was in a hurry to leave the place immediately[^152], he was obviously seeking to evade the arm of the law when he ignored the advice of the security supervisor, PW7, to wait until the police arrived, while telling PW7 to fuck off.[^153] The AP had left the scene soon after the incident occurred and did not of his own volition leave any identification details with PW4 or the security officers. I accepted PW7’s evidence that he had told the AP not to leave the premises as “the SPF was already activated”[^154] and the case _“is on SPF assistance_”[^155] which the AP ignored[^156]. Given the AP’s violent acts committed towards PW4, PW7 and other security guards were waiting for the police to arrive to deal with the AP and obtain his identification details, and they could not stop the AP from leaving the scene for obvious reasons, and PW7 had also testified that the security guards “have no warrant to enforce[^157]”.

> (f)     As I had found under **Issue 1(c)** above, PW4’s acts of pointing his fingers at the AP and yelling at the AP to get out of the taxi as well as “grabbing” the AP on his upper left arm and also his black backpack kept in the taxi boot which led to PW4 “ripping” apart the AP's plastic shopping bags and causing the groceries to fall apart, did not and could not, in my view, justify the AP’s act of pushing and kicking the AP as the defence has failed to establish that the AP has a right to private defence or that grave and sudden provocation applies as a partial defence to the charge preferred against him, as explained under **Issue 1(d)** above. As pointed out by the prosecution[^158], the defence had sought to characterise an incident with the AP’s torn grocery bags as PW4 “ripping”/”tearing” the plastic bags apart,[^159] but this is not an accurate depiction of the incident which took place after the AP had already committed an offence and the AP himself had also conceded during cross-examination that the bags had ripped because both parties were pulling them.[^160]

> (g)     As I have found under **Issue 1(d)** above, it was justified for PW4 under the aforesaid circumstances to behave in such an aggressive and argumentative way towards the AP (as perceived by the AP) to try to stop him from walking away from the situation and trying to engage another taxi before the police arrived. I rejected the defence submission[^161] that the AP did not initiate the fight and that it was PW4 who kept coming at the AP and instigating a fight towards the AP first. I also disagreed with the defence submission[^162] that “_the AP’s injury was the fault of his own threatening mannerisms i.e. the pointing of his finger, “grabbing” the AP and his belongings, tearing the AP's bags apart, and going around to open the taxi passenger doors that led to the AP pushing him away and kicking his thigh.”_

> (h)     As pointed out by the prosecution[^163], the defence assertion that the AP “_could not have possibly been able to ask for assistance from security who were not present at the material time_”[^164] is expressly contradicted by the evidence of the security officer, PW2 who had given evidence that he had been stationed within 20 metres of the taxi stand and was close enough to see the AP kicked PW4.[^165] However, despite having reasonable opportunity to seek help from PW2, the AP chose to take matters into his own hands by kicking and pushing PW4 instead.

> (i)     In this regard:

>> (i)       I rejected the defence submissions[^166] that PW2 could have done something to diffuse the situation or PW4 could have approached PW2 for help, as I have found, under **Issues 1(c) to 1(d) above**, that given the AP’s violent acts committed towards PW4, PW7 and other security guards, which included PW2, were waiting for the police to arrive to deal with the AP and obtain his identification details and hence, they could not have done something to diffuse the situation, or help PW4 to deal with the AP. In my view, the aforesaid reasons and the passage of time which could have led to PW2 not been able to recall the incident, could explain (as stated in the defence submission[^167]) why _“PW2's response to the questions of the prosecution included, "Don't see", "Never saw", "Not very sure", "I cannot remember", and PW2 also testified that he never spoke to either the passenger or driver (Lines 12 to 15, Day l , page 29). His level of involvement was essentially non-existent as he, "left everything to my supervisor." (Lines 27 to 28, Day I on page 29). That explains why PW2 did not appear until time stamped 17:08:39, well after the material incident took place.”_

>> (ii)       I found no merit in the defence assertions[^168] that _“it is PW4 who can be seen pointing his finger aggressively towards the AP. This aggressive behaviour continues throughout the CCTV footage up until security arrived at 17:08:29, when the AP was preparing to leave and engage another taxi. It is important to note that security was not present during PW4's actions. As a result, the AP could not have possibly been able to ask for assistance from security who were not present at the material time”._

>> (iii)       I could not accept the defence submissions[^169] that _“\[t\]here was never an opportunity for the AP to disengage from PW4. From 17:07:50 to 17:08:02 of the CCTV footage, the AP proceeded to head to the boot to take his belongings. That in itself is a form of disengagement, as he was trying to defuse the situation by attempting to leave. However, PW4 kept blocking his path and even blocked the boot of the taxi with his hand to prevent the AP from leaving. This led the AP to push PW4, who was obstructing the AP at that point in time. Subsequently, PW4 did not back off and even ripped apart the AP's plastic shopping bags. PW4's attempt at preventing the AP from walking away and his actions show his intended aggression towards the AP, and the AP's push towards PW4 was an attempt to disengage himself from the situation.”_

>> (iv)       In my view, there is no basis for all the aforesaid defence assertions and submissions based on my findings under **Issue 1(c) to Issue 1(e)** above.

> (j)     As I have found earlier under **Issue 1(d)** above, the CCTV footage showed that PW4 had simply touched the AP on his elbow in order to prevent him from leaving with no scuffle or tussle between the parties and causing no injury or apprehension to the AP. Further, no medical evidence had been adduced by the AP at the trial that this incident has greatly caused the AP to suffer emotional and psychological harm; of his counselling with both a psychiatrist and psychologist since October 2020; and his diagnosis with diverticular disease which perhaps the diagnosis had something to do with the incident, as submitted by the defence[^170].

> (k)     In this regard, I rejected the defence denial[^171] of PW4 merely _“touching the elbow of the AP”_ and also the defence submisson that _“..the CCTV footage… clearly shows PW4 grabbing the AP in an attempt to obstruct his path and ability to take his belongings out of the boot of the taxi.”_

> (l)     I accepted the prosecution submissions[^172] that the defence has conflated several distinct legal concepts by simultaneously arguing that: (a) the AP did not have the requisite intention for the s 323 charge, (b) the AP was exercising self-defence when he pushed and kicked PW4, and (c) PW4 had initiated the confrontation by provoking the AP. While all three arguments could have been made in the alternative, the defence has instead sought to rely on all three at the same time. This leads to two contradictory assertions: (a) that the AP did not have the intention to cause hurt to PW4, but also (b) that he intended to cause hurt because he was exercising self-defence and had been provoked by PW4 initially. This would be logically impossible. This approach also conflates the legal burdens on the respective parties. While the prosecution bears the legal burden of proving the elements of the offence beyond reasonable doubt, the defence in turn bears the legal burden of proving the defences of private defence and provocation on balance of probabilities[^173]. By conflating the aforesaid concepts, the defence is impermissibly trying to relieve itself of the burden of proving the aforesaid defences.

## AMENDMENT OF THE CHARGE

14     Section 128 of the Criminal Procedure Code provides that the court may alter a charge or frame a new charge, whether in substitution for or in addition to the existing charge, at any time before judgment is given, and a new or altered charge must be read and explained to the accused.

15     I took the view that the _actus reus_ of the offence should be framed with greater specificity and accepted the prosecution proposal that “_pushing his upper body several times and kicking his thigh once” i_n the original charge should be amended to _“pushing him four times and kicking him twice”_. I agreed with the prosecution that since the proposed amendment here pertains purely to the _actus reus_, which the AP does not dispute, no consequential recall of any witnesses or calling of additional witnesses is necessary as there is also no prejudice to the AP since the prosecution has consistently maintained throughout the trial that the AP had pushed PW4 four times and kicked him twice[^174]. The defence has stated[^175] that it “_has no issues with regards to the amendments of the charge, namely the \[AP\] voluntarily caused hurt by pushing \[PW4\] four times and kicking him twice_.” Accordingly, the charge (as amended in bold below) which was read to the AP before judgment was given read as follows:

> “…you, on 14 February 2019, at or about 5.07p.m., at Thomson Plaza Taxi Stand located at 301 Upper Thomson Road, Singapore 574408, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Gui Eng Chew, _to wit_, by **pushing him four times and kicking him twice**, causing him to suffer from tenderness over the chest wall, left shoulder and left forearm, with intention of causing hurt to him and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).”

## CONCLUSION FOR THE TRIAL

16     For all the above reasons, I was satisfied that the AP has no defence to the charge and also raised no reasonable doubt in the prosecution’s case. I found that the prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt in respect of the charge in MCN-900340-2020 (as amended in paragraph 15 above) which has been preferred against the AP who is found guilty and convicted accordingly.

### SENTENCE

### Issue 2(a): What are the sentencing considerations as well as the aggravating and mitigating factors to be taken into account by the court in sentencing the AP for the offence?

17     The prosecution sought a sentence of between 7 to 8 weeks’ imprisonment and had relied on _Wong Hoi Len v PP <span class="citation">\[2009\] 1 SLR(R) 115</span>[^176]_ which as a decision of the High Court binds this court (unless there are mitigating factors in the present case which did not exist in _Wong Hoi Len_). _Wong Hoi Len_ involved an offender who pleaded guilty to one charge under s 323 for voluntarily causing hurt to a victim who was a taxi driver, and where the High Court held that for all acts of criminal violence against public transport workers, the starting benchmark for a simple assault should be a custodial sentence of around four weeks in cases where an accused person with no antecedent pleads guilty to a charge under s 323 of the Penal Code and the recipient of violence is a public transport worker, as these workers provide the larger community with an invaluable and essential service, and they have every right to work in a safe and secure environment.

18     As highlighted by the High Court in _Wong Hoi Len_, the mitigating factors that may affect sentence include the following : (i) Whether the offender has any antecedents; **(ii) Whether there was any voluntary and unconditional offer to compensate, even if the offer was not accepted;** and **(iii) Whether there was a plea of guilt, which must be a convincing testament of genuine remorse**. As for aggravating factors, these include the following : (i) Where the assault occurred at night, a time when the public transport workers are most vulnerable; and (ii) **The manner in which the assault was carried out.[^177]** (emphasis in bold mine)

19     I agreed with the prosecution submissions[^178] that the High Court indicative starting custodial sentence of 4 weeks should be adjusted upwards in the present case based on the following aggravating factors:

> (a)     there was no plea of guilt by the AP as a convincing testament of genuine remorse as the AP has elected to claim trial despite the overwhelming evidence underpinning his guilt, and his attempts to paint PW4 who was the victim as the aggressor show that he lacks even a shred of remorse. Despite having his deplorable actions captured on CCTV footage and his own admissions that he had pushed and kicked PW4 multiple times, the AP maintained that he had no intention to hurt PW4 and was allegedly acting in self-defence after being provoked by PW4’s attitude.

> (b)     In this regard, in the light of what I have found under **Issue 1(c) to Issue 1(e)** above, I rejected the defence denial[^179] that the “_AP has elected to claim trial in response to the evidence that has been displayed — the CCTV footage, notes of evidence and every other document shown has unjustifiably displayed the AP's true nature; a father trying to protect his son from any violence that ensued. The AP was never an aggressor to begin with, and for the prosecution to state that he lacks even a shred of remorse does not make sense, as all the evidence has clearly shown that the AP did what he did to protect his son, who was present with him throughout the entire incident_”.

> (c)     The high intensity and extended duration of violence that the AP inflicted on PW4, as I had found under **Issue 1(d) above**, is a significant aggravating factor. The AP ’s sustained assault on PW4 was plainly over and above the “simple assault” that the _Wong Hoi Len_ benchmark was calibrated on. Although PW4 had put up little to no resistance, the AP pushed him four times and kicked him twice over a period of about 30 seconds. It was an entirely one-sided and sustained offence. The High Court benchmark sentence of 4 weeks should be adjusted upwards to account for the manner in which the assault was carried out and such unnecessary violence.

> (d)     In this regard, in the light of what I have found under **Issue 1(c) to Issue 1(e)** above, I rejected the defence denial[^180] that “.._the high intensity and extended duration of violence inflicted on PW4 as depicted from the Prosecution is in no way admissible. Despite PW4 putting up "little to no resistance", it is important to take note that PW4's mannerisms, actions and aggressive nature (as shown on the CCTV footage) were the catalysts leading to the incident to occur in the first place. The AP was confronted by PW4's aggressive manner from the moment he began pointing and shouting at the AP and his son from of the CCTV footage onwards. Thus, the AP's actions towards PW4 were indeed necessary for him to defend himself and his child_.”

> (e)     the AP’s attempts to evade apprehension are aggravating. As I have found under **Issue 1(c) to Issue 1(e)** above, the AP was clearly seeking to evade the arm of the law when he ignored the advice of the security supervisor, PW7, to wait until the police arrived, while telling PW7 to fuck off.[^181] The AP had left the scene soon after the incident occurred and did not of his own volition leave any identification details with PW4 or the security officers. I accepted PW7’s evidence that he had told the AP not to leave the premises as “the SPF was already activated”[^182] and the case _“is on SPF assistance_”[^183] which the AP ignored[^184]. Given the AP’s violent acts committed towards PW4, PW7 and other security guards were waiting for the police to arrive to deal with the AP and obtain his identification details, and they could not stop the AP from leaving the scene for obvious reasons, and PW7 had also testified that the security guards “have no warrant to enforce” [^185] . For the same aforesaid reasons, PW7 who recognised the AP when he came back with his son for his weekly shopping and errands at Thomson Plaza could not deal with the AP when he came back. As a result of his actions, the police had to expend significant resources to track him down over a period of one month.[^186] I agreed with the prosecution[^187] that the AP had returned to Thomson Plaza in the subsequent weeks after the incident because he assumed that he had successfully evaded apprehension for the incident since his particulars have yet to be ascertained by anyone, including the police, and the security officers did not and could not do anything for the aforesaid reasons.

> (f)     There was no voluntary and unconditional offer by the AP to compensate PW4 as the victim. In this regard, pursuant to section 359 of the Criminal Procedure Code, I granted, as sought by the prosecution, a total **compensation order of $441** (in default 2 days imprisonment) comprising $141 for PW4’s medical fees and $300 for his lost income during two days of medical leave.[^188]

20     I rejected the defence submissions[^189] that the benchmark for a custodial sentence has not been crossed in the present case for the aforesaid reasons as well as the following reasons:

> (a)     Based on my findings under **Issue 1(c) to Issue 1(e)** above, I took the view that the several exceptions to the general rule in _Wong Hoi Len_ (as submitted by the defence) do not apply to the present case based on the salient facts as submitted by the defence as there is no basis for these facts as stated below:

>> (i)       PW4 was the first to exhibit aggressive behaviour as seen on the CCTV footage.

>> (ii)       The AP was obstructed by PW4, as he attempted to exit the taxi and throughout the situation.

>> (iii)       Obstruction by PW4 continued on throughout the incident, even as the AP was leaving to engage another taxi.

>> (iv)       The AP departed from Thomson Plaza with his child (who has special needs) at the earliest possible opportunity for the sake of the child and to deescalate the situation.

>> (v)       The events that transpired inside the taxi which led to the dispute between the AP and PW4.

> (b)     As I have found earlier under **Issue 1(d)** above, PW4 was not instigating a fight towards the AP first as under the circumstances of this case, it was justified for PW4 to behave in such an aggressive and argumentative way towards the AP (as perceived by the AP) to try to stop him from walking away from the situation and trying to engage another taxi before the police arrived. Further, I have found that the AP’s claim of trying to protect his son and that PW4 had been obstructing his way were afterthoughts not specifically mentioned in his statement to PW5. Moreover, no evidence had been adduced by the AP at the trial of his son’s medical condition as only an Educational Psychology Assessment on his son, written by a psychologist Dr Louise McCauley-White was annexed to the defence submission on sentence in Appendix C.

> (c)     Hence, I rejected the defence submission[^190] that _“PW4 has contributed to the assault on the AP on that day. PW4 should not have come out of his taxi, aggressively pointing his finger towards the AP after while asking him to get out of the taxi. PW4 kept moving forward in an aggressive manner, causing the AP to make the first move to push PW4 away.”_

> (d)     Based on my findings under **Issue 1(c) to Issue 1(d)** above, I was unable to accept the defence submission[^191] that _“When the AP was removing his things from the boot, PW4 had grabbed the AP's upper left arm and PW4 had also ripped apart the AP's black shopping bags, causing his items to fall apart….all these events aggravated the situation_.” Similarly, there is no basis for the defence submission[^192] that “_PW4 kept on stepping on his items, grabbing him, continuously obstructing his ability to progress to get out of there, to get his belongings together which PW4 had just destroyed….It is crucial to note that the AP had to get out of the situation because his son is autistic, and he is already upset. The AP was calming the situation down, trying to move away and defuse the situation, but PW4 continued to pursue him in order to exacerbate the situation.”_

> (e)     As regards the defence submission[^193] that PW5 had testified that “PW4 just kept coming and kept provoking” when asked what he meant by the AP's statement to PW5 stating “I don't like how he got into my grille and his attitude", I have found, under **Issue 1(d)** above, that the defence of grave and sudden provocation is not made out on the facts in the present case.

> (f)     I have found, under **Issue 1(c)** above, that given the AP’s violent acts committed towards PW4, PW7 and other security guards were waiting for the police to arrive to deal with the AP and obtain his identification details when he did not of his own volition leave any identification details with PW4 or the security officers who could not stop the AP from leaving the scene for obvious reasons, and PW7 had also testified that the security guards “have no warrant to enforce” [^194]. I accepted PW7’s evidence that he had told the AP not to leave the premises as “the SPF was already activated”[^195] and the case _“ is on SPF assistance_”[^196] which the AP ignored[^197]. As such, I rejected the defence submission[^198] that _“ PW4 could have easily called for assistance from the security guards, which he did and yet he decided to take matters into his own hands. This was not a situation where PW4 was left to fend for himself when confronted with a difficult passenger.”_

> (g)     The case of _PP v Lim Liang Huat <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGDC 150</span>_ was relied upon by the defence[^199] wherein the offender was fined $4000 in default 3 weeks imprisonment for the charge under s 323 of the Penal Code as the court agreed that the taxi driver had also contributed to the assault by coming out of his taxi in response to the challenge by the offender and the court noted that the taxi driver could have easily called for assistance and there was no basis for the taxi driver to fear that the offender would drag him out of his taxi. The altercation between the offender and the taxi driver also took place only after the taxi driver got out of his taxi. I took the view that this sentencing precedent is clearly distinguishable and inapplicable to the present case for the following reasons:

>> (i)       PW4 did not contribute to the assault by coming out of his taxi in response to a challenge by the AP as PW4 simply wanted the AP to leave his taxi as he did not know how to bring the AP to his destination.

>> (ii)       PW4 did ask for assistance from the security guards at Thomson Plaza who, given the AP’s violent acts committed towards PW4, were waiting for the police to arrive to deal with the AP and obtain his identification details when he did not of his own volition leave any identification details with PW4 or the security officers who could not stop the AP from leaving the scene for obvious reasons, and PW7 had also testified that the security guards “have no warrant to enforce” [^200]. I accepted PW7’s evidence that he had told the AP not to leave the premises as “the SPF was already activated”[^201] and the case _“ is on SPF assistance_”[^202] which the AP ignored[^203].

>> (iii)       While the altercation between the AP and PW4 took place only after PW4 got out of his taxi, the violent acts were committed by the AP against PW4 in connection with the performance of his duty as a taxi driver. It must be noted that the offender in _Wong Hoi Len_ struck the victim when the latter had already exited the public transport vehicle and he received an imprisonment sentence.

>> (iv)       While the offender in _Lim Liang Huat_ had pleaded guilty at the pre-trial stage, the AP had claimed trial despite the overwhelming evidence against him and is not entitled to any pre-trial sentencing discount in the present case.

> (h)     The defence had also relied on the case of _Balbir Singh s/o Amar Singh v PP and another appeal <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGHC 123</span>[^204]_ where in Magistrate’s Appeal No 300 of 2009, the appellant, a Japanese expatriate named Taniguchi Mitsuru (“_TM’s case_”), had an altercation with a taxi driver. The appellant had boarded the victim’s taxi and showed the taxi driver an address on his mobile phone and requested that he be sent there. After arriving at the vicinity of that address, the taxi driver was unable to locate the apartment block. After a considerable delay, the appellant became angry and informed the taxi driver that he would not pay the taxi fare if the taxi driver was unable to find the apartment block. Still unable to find the block, the appellant then instructed the taxi driver to stop by the side of the road, and alighted without paying the fare. The taxi driver followed the appellant to press for payment but the appellant responded by pushing him away. The taxi driver then went to his taxi, retrieved an umbrella, and caught up with the appellant. The appellant grabbed the umbrella and a tussle then ensued. In the course of this tussle, the taxi driver sustained several injuries. The appellant was subsequently charged with voluntarily causing hurt. Based on the aforesaid facts, the High Court reduced the lower court’s sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment to a fine of $2,000 and held that the district judge failed to appreciate that the appellant had not intended to cause the injury. The appellant had a genuine grievance against the taxi driver even if he was wrong in refusing to pay the fare. When the taxi driver returned with the umbrella, the appellant had apprehended that the taxi driver might use it on him. In trying to grab the umbrella, the appellant was trying to prevent it from being used on him. It was in the course of this struggle for control that the taxi driver’s head was cut with the tip of the umbrella. The fact that the appellant’s act was motivated by his apprehension that the umbrella might be used against him is an important factor to be taken into consideration in sentencing. The sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment was manifestly excessive in the circumstances of the case, and a fine of $2,000 would have been the appropriate punishment.

> (i)     I took the view that the above _TM’s case_ is clearly distinguishable and inapplicable to the present case for the following reasons:

>> (i)       As I have found under **Issue 1(d) to Issue 1(e)** above, unlike the _TM’s case_, there was no scuffle or tussle in the present case where the violence was one-sided on the AP’s part as PW4 who was hurt by the AP and suffered injuries never retaliated. The AP had initiated the physical contact and persisted with his violent conduct throughout the interaction, and PW4 did not arm himself or otherwise offer sufficient provocation that would have justified the AP’s use of violence. There was no evidence adduced at the trial that the AP’s act was motivated by his apprehension that the AP might hurt him or his son.

>> (ii)       In this regard, I rejected the defence submission[^205] that “_Unlike in the \[TM’s\] case, where the taxi driver armed himself with an umbrella, in the present case, the actions of PW4 are just as threatening, regardless of whether PW4 was armed or not…\[and\] there was sufficient provocation to justify why the AP did what he did_”, as I have found, under **Issue 1(d) above**, that the defence of grave and sudden provocation is not made out on the facts in the present case.

>> (iii)       The offender in the _TM’s case_ had pleaded guilty at the pre-trial stage, but the AP has elected to claim trial despite the overwhelming evidence underpinning his guilt, and his attempts to paint PW4 as the victim as the aggressor show that he lacks even a shred of remorse.

21     Although the defence is seeking a non-custodial sentence, the case of _PP v Hew Soo Fun, Cheryl <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGMC 55</span>[^206]_ was referred to by the defence[^207] wherein the offender was sentenced to 10 days’ imprisonment for the charge under s 323 of the Penal Code and the court had observed as follows:

> (a)     In the statement of facts which the offender admitted to without qualification, the victim came out of his taxi at the petrol station to seek assistance. Thus, instead of aggravating the situation by confronting the offender as happened in the case in _Lim Liang Huat_, the victim here was actually and actively trying to seek assistance from others at the petrol kiosk, precisely because of the offender’s earlier aggression and actions against him when he was driving her in his vehicle. Notably, it was the offender who followed the victim out of his vehicle, and assaulted him.

> (b)     despite the victim being significantly bigger in size than the offender, who was described as being “about half the size of the \[victim\]”, there was no evidence that the victim responded against her actions, or retaliated against her in any manner. Instead, the offender even continued her aggression after the assault by pursuing the victim into the convenience store, where she committed the final offence of using criminal force against him.

> (c)     Contrary to the defence claim that a victim could not be regarded as “…a public transport worker once he stepped out of his car”, both in _PP v Chan Siew Yin <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGMC 27</span>_, as well as in the seminal case of _Wong Hoi Len_, the offenders struck the victims when the latter had already exited the public transport vehicle. Notably, the offenders in both those cases received imprisonment sentences.

22     I was of the view that the case of _PP v Hew Soo Fun, Cheryl_ where the custody threshold was crossed is applicable as the facts therein are similar to our present case where the incident took place when both parties had exited the taxi and PW4 as the victim had sought assistance from the security guards at Thomson Plaza after the AP pushed and kicked him, but to no avail as explained under **Issue 1(d)** above. There was also no evidence that PW4 retaliated against the AP who suffered no injury as the CCTV footage showed that PW4 had simply touched the AP on his elbow in order to prevent him from leaving, as I have found under **Issue 1(d)** above.

23     However, in my view, the custodial sentence of 10 days’ imprisonment imposed on the offender in _PP v Hew Soo Fun, Cheryl_ is inappropriate and should not be applied to the present case as the AP’s offending behaviour in the present case is far more egregious and the indicative starting custodial sentence of 4 weeks in _Wong Hoi Len_ should be adjusted upwards based on the aggravating factors highlighted above. Further, unlike in _Hew Soo Fun, Cheryl_, there was no evidence of any significant size difference between the parties that might mitigate the excessive use of force in the present case, and the offender in _Hew Soo Fun, Cheryl_ had pleaded guilty after the CCTV footages were shown to her[^208], whereas the AP had claimed trial despite clear CCTV footages of his s 323 offence in the present case.

24     As the mitigating factors submitted by the defence have been taken into account by the High Court in its indicative starting custodial sentence of 4 weeks in _Wong Hoi Len_, there is no merit in the defence submission[^209] that _“the AP has no history of violence and that this was his first brush with the law. The AP did not plan this, nor were there any weapons used… PW4's injuries only consisted of a slight tenderness over the chest wall, left shoulder and left forearm. The altercation lasted for only a short while. This event happened in the spur of the moment when PW4 came out his taxi to confront the AP. In this case, PW4 should not have behaved aggressively towards the AP.”_ Based on my findings under **Issue 1(b) to Issue (e)** above, there is also no basis for the defence submission[^210] that a fine should be imposed “_on the AP if the Court is of the view that the offence is made up against the AP. For the avoidance of doubt, the AP has always maintained that he never had the intention to hurt or harm_.”

### Issue 2(b) : What is the appropriate sentence to be imposed on the AP, and why?

25     For all the above reasons and having regard to the sentencing precedents cited by both parties as well as the aggravating factors highlighted above, I took the view that the appropriate sentence to impose on the AP would be 6 weeks’ imprisonment in respect of the amended charge preferred against the AP in MCN-900340-2020, which was not manifestly excessive or inadequate based on all the facts and circumstances of this case, but entirely appropriate. In my view, such a sentence is commensurate with the AP’s overall criminality and is a sufficient deterrent sentence tempered with proportionality without the effect of a crushing sentence.
