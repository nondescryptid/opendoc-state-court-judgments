Civil Procedure – Pleadings – Amendment – Application for leave to withdraw an admission made in pleadings

9 December 2020

### Deputy Registrar Vince Gui:

## Introduction

1       This case concerns the withdrawal of admissions made in pleadings.

2       The Plaintiff in this case sought leave to withdraw admissions of fact made in his Statement of Claim. The application turned out to be hotly contested, with parties making extensive submissions on foreign cases from England, Australia and India that expounded on their respective laws applicable to the withdrawal of admissions. In the course of my deliberation, it came as a surprise to me that many of these foreign cases have not been considered in local case law, even though amendment applications are nowadays commonplace in civil litigation. After hearing parties, I granted leave to amend the Plaintiff’s case, and in doing so, I decided to follow some of these cases but declined to follow others. Given the dearth of local case law on this matter, I now deliver the written grounds of my decision, focusing on the interplay between the foreign jurisprudence on withdrawal of admissions and the local jurisprudence on amendment of pleadings.

## Background facts

3       The present action, commenced on 29 May 2019, arose from a motor accident involving the Plaintiff and the Defendant that took place on 14 January 2018. At the material time, the Plaintiff was driving along the right-most lane of Potong Pasir Avenue 1 towards the direction of Potong Pasir Avenue 3. The Plaintiff’s pleaded case was that the Defendant’s vehicle, travelling in the lane left to his, collided into his vehicle when the Defendant “suddenly lost control and skidded”. According to the Statement of Claim, the Defendant negligently drove a vehicle “with a defective tyre” and failed to ensure that the Defendant’s vehicle was “roadworthy”, amongst others. The Defendant pleaded in his Defence that he “suddenly lost control of the car and/or the car skidded … as a result of an unfortunate tyre puncture”.

4       After the close of pleadings, parties underwent alternative dispute resolution at the State Courts Court Dispute Resolution Centre (“SCCDR”) but were unable to resolve their dispute amicably. Accordingly, directions were given for the parties to file their Affidavits of Evidence-in-Chief (“AEIC”). In his AEIC filed on 5 December 2019, the Plaintiff averred, amongst others, that the Defendant’s vehicle “suddenly and without warning swerved to the right wanting to make a U-turn and in so doing, collided onto the left front of \[the Plaintiff’s vehicle\]”. Contrary to his pleaded case, the Plaintiff’s AEIC was silent on the condition of the Defendant’s tyre and whether it had caused the Defendant to lose control of his vehicle.

5       The matter was set down for trial on 3 December 2019 and a pre-trial conference (“PTC”) was scheduled on 8 January 2020. At the PTC, the Plaintiff’s counsel informed the court that he would be seeking leave to amend his pleadings.

6       About a week later, on 14 January 2020, the Plaintiff took out the present application to amend his Statement of Claim. By the amendment, the Plaintiff sought to delete the pleaded averments made on the condition of the Defendant’s vehicle (in particular, his tyre) and the pleaded averments as to the cause of the accident. Instead, he proposed to plead that the accident was caused by the Defendant inconsiderate driving, by reason of him swerving to his right without keeping a proper lookout. As the Plaintiff and his solicitors explained on affidavit, the amendments were necessitated by what they described as “drafting errors”. According to them, what transpired was that the Plaintiff’s solicitors had erroneously drafted the Statement of Claim by reference to the Defendant’s accident statement. The Defendant in his accident statement dated 15 January 2018 described the accident to have been caused by a punctured right tyre which in turned caused the vehicle to skid. In his affidavits filed in supporting of this application, the Plaintiff averred that the Statement of Claim was not drafted in accordance with his instructions. He explained that his instructions were to prepare the Statement of Claim based on the accident statement and police report lodged by him dated 14 and 15 January 2018 respectively. In these documents, the Plaintiff averred that the Defendant’s vehicle swerved to the right wanting to make a U-turn, causing the resulting collision. No mention was made of the alleged tyre puncture or skid.

7       The Defendant strenuously opposed the application on two main grounds: first, the application was not made in good faith; and second, the Defendant had relied on the prior admission to his detriment. As to the first argument, the Defendant mainly took exception at the late stage at which the amendment was sought, contending that the Plaintiff should have made the amendment earlier if it was truly at odds with his instructions. On the issue of prejudice, the Defendant emphasised that the amendment would fundamentally reshape the Plaintiff’s case. The Defendant took the view that the issue of tyre puncture was never in dispute and accordingly did not retain or thought to retain any evidence to prove the same. As the punctured tyre was no longer available, the Defendant could no longer avail himself of an expert opinion on the condition of the tyre.

8       On the delay in filing this application, the Plaintiff explained that the solicitors only realised the error when they were preparing for the PTC. As to the disposal of the tyre, the Plaintiff pointed out that the Defendant was silent on when he disposed of the tyre. In his view, the Defendant had clearly disposed of the tyre before the action was even commenced, and the alleged evidential handicap was a mere afterthought.

## Discussion

### Legal principles

9       The law on amendment of pleadings is well-settled. The guiding principle is that amendments to pleadings ought to be allowed if they would enable the real issue in controversy between the parties to be determined, subject to cost penalties, unless the amendment would cause irreparable prejudice or injustice to the opposing party. This is so even if the amendment was necessitated by oversight or the application for amendment is made very late in the day (_Wright Norman and another v Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] 3 SLR(R) 640</span> (“_Wright Norman_”) at \[6\]). An important caveat to granting leave for the amendment of pleadings is that it must be just to grant such leave, having regard to all the circumstances of the case (_Review Publishing Co Ltd and another v Lee Hsien Loong and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 1 SLR 52</span> at \[113\]). Where amendment has the effect of withdrawing admissions, what are circumstances that would come to bear? Given the dearth of local authorities, I turned to foreign jurisprudence for guidance.

10      _Gale v Superdrug Stores plc_ \[1996\] 3 All ER 468 (“_Gale v Superdrug_”) is one of the first few cases where the English Court of Appeal expounded on the law applicable to the withdrawal of admissions. The claimant in this case was injured in an accident while in the employment of the defendants. Before the plaintiff took legal action, the defendants’ insurers made an admission of liability followed by interim payment to the claimant on the damages. Parties continued negotiations on quantum of damages. About three years after the accident, the claimant decided to commence action to avoid the claim from becoming time-barred. The defendants denied liability in their defence. Pointing to their earlier admission, the claimant applied to strike out the defence as an abuse of process. The lower courts consistently agreed with the claimant and denied the defendants leave to withdraw their admission. On appeal to the English Court of Appeal, the defendants finally succeeded. By 2:1 majority, the court granted the defendants leave to withdraw the admission.

11     The majority rejected the claimant’s submission that the application should stand or fall based on the sufficiency of the reasons furnished by the applicant. Waite LJ took the view that the reasons (or the lack thereof) is merely part of the overall picture and will carry no more weight than the particular circumstances require. In his view, there was no evidence to show that the claimant would be prejudiced by the withdrawal. For example, there was no eye witness whose evidence would have been obtained if liability had been in issue but who cannot now be traced. He found that lower court erred in treating the claimant’s disappointment as a form of prejudice, and a party resisting the retraction of an admission must produce clear and cogent evidence of prejudice before the court can be persuaded to “restrain the privilege which every litigant enjoys of freedom to change his mind”.

12     Millett LJ, the second member of the majority, preferred to analyse the application as though it were an application for leave to amend pleadings. Consistent with the law on amendment of pleadings, he found that the court should “ordinarily allow an admission to be withdrawn if it can be done without injustice to the other party of If no question of bad faith or overreaching is involved.” Like Waite LJ, he did not find it necessary for applicants to justify the application with an “adequate explanation”. That said, he appeared to be sufficiently satisfied with the reason given by the defendants. Apparently, the decision to admit liability was made by the insurers without legal advice, and when their solicitors came on board, they were advised to contest liability. Millett LJ further found that the defendants had a “strongly arguable defence” with a “real prospect of success”, and there is no question of “strategic manoeuvring”. In his view, it would be a “serious injustice” if they were precluded from disputing liability.

13     Like _Gale v Superdrug_, the case of _Gunn and another (t/a Chipperfield Garden Machinery) v Taygroup Ltd_ \[2010\] EWHC 1665 (“_Gunn_”) also involved a defendant who made a pre-writ admission of liability. In this case, a vehicle driven by an employee of the defendant damaged overhead cables attached to the claimant’s premises. Parties underwent out-of-court negotiations. About 28 months later, the defendant’s representatives informed the claimant that “liability was not in dispute”. Unable to reach a settlement, the claimant commenced legal action, expressly relying on the defendant’s prior admission. The defendant denied liability in his defence and pleaded contributory negligence. The defendant argued, amongst others, that the earlier admission was wrongly made and sought to withdraw the same. The claimant resisted on the ground that they would suffer real prejudice where important evidence had been lost or had deteriorated in the period that had elapsed since the incident giving rise to the claim. Akenhead J of the English High Court found in favour of the defendant. Focussing on the issue of prejudice, the court found that the claimant failed to prove prejudice. Central to his analysis was the fact that there was no effective admission made until some 28 months after the incident, which was ample time for the claimant to secure basic witness statements and other documentary evidence. In short, any loss of evidence was the claimant’s own doing. In any event, the court found that the claimant had taken steps to gather evidence in the intervening period. There was no evidence to suggest that the evidence collation exercise had not provided an adequate answer to the amended defence. There was also no evidence to support the inference that evidence on liability had been lost following the admission made by the defendant. Further, the claimant was not without “ammunition” in response to the “new” defence – they had, at least, the draft witness statements and could also rely on the differences that emerged in the defendant’s pleaded case.

14     Apart from these reasons, the court also considered that the admission was made in circumstances where the claim was quantified at an amount that was five times more than the initial claim sum which prompted the defendant to reconsider the prior admission. In those circumstances, it was somewhat unfair to hold the defendant to an admission of liability on a claim that had ballooned fivefold in value. The balance of convenience weighed in favour of withdrawing the admission.

15     In summary, the courts in _Gale v Superdrug_ and _Gunn_ allowed the admissions to be withdrawn primarily because the withdrawal would not cause the respondent to suffer irreparable prejudice, and on balance, the applicant would suffer greater prejudice if the withdrawal were denied. The fact that the application was motivated by a genuine mistake and rather than being a tactical play was also considered by the courts in exercising their discretion.

16     These cases may be contrasted with two other English decisions where the court disallowed admissions from being withdrawn, principally because they would cause the respondent to suffer irreparable prejudice. In _Sollitt v DJ Broady Ltd and another_ \[2000\] Lexis Citation 4748, the claimant was hit and injured by an excavator. The claimant sued the defendant, alleging that the excavator was operated by one of its employees. In its Defence, the defendant admitted to this, but denied negligence. Proceedings went afoot towards discovery. About two and a half years later, the defendant took out an application to substitute itself with another company. It transpired that, at the time of the accident, the excavator was operated by an employee of a different company. The defendant had, after the accident but before the commencement of the action, acquired the assets of the company, but not its liabilities. By the time the proceedings were commenced, the liability owed to the claimant, if any, would have laid with the other company, and not the defendant in question. The identity of the defendant was significant because the other company sought to be named as the defendant had no assets and was effectively uninsured. The English Court of Appeal, led by Lord Bingham CJ, had no difficulty finding prejudice. As a result of the admission, the claimant had been deprived of measures it could have taken to secure the fruits of the litigation against the proper defendant. He explained as follows:

>     Thus, it is said, \[the plaintiff\] would have been no worse off. It is true that we cannot be sure what would have happened had the true facts been brought to the attention of \[the plaintiff\] and his solicitors at the right time. There are, however, a number of possibilities. One is that \[the plaintiff\] and his advisers would if necessary have made sure that \[the other company\] retained funds sufficient to meet a claim. Another is that, if there were doubts about the assets available to \[the other company\], the insurance position would have been fully explored. Another possibility is that \[the plaintiff\] and his advisers would have entered into negotiations with the insurers with a view to making an early settlement. Another possibility is that application would have been made for an interim payment. Another is that Mr Neylon, the driver of the excavator, would have been joined in the action personally, the claim being one not beyond the means of a private individual. \[The plaintiff\] says that because of \[the defendant’s\] admissions and the failure to alert him to the true position, he lost the opportunity to consider the courses of action open to him on the true facts and to take whatever steps were judged necessary to protect his interests. In short, he was lulled by a belief that he had in \[the defendant\], a defendant who was admitting liability and was able to meet any judgment whether supported by the company's insurers or not into considering and taking none of these steps.

17     Prejudice can also manifest in a real likelihood of the claimant being deprived of a trial. _Barnard v Sappi Europe Ltd and another_ \[2005\] EWHC 2169 (QB) illustrates how prejudice of this sort can work to the injustice of the claimant. The claimant was a patient suffering from malignant mesothelioma of the pleura. He was a dying man by the time he commenced proceedings, living on what Judge Hegarty QC called “borrowed time”. In January 2005, doctors gave him less than six months to live. In April 2005, after he had spent months tracing his original employer, he commenced proceedings against the defendant, on the back of a pre-action representation made by the defendant that they were the correct defendant to sue, which the court understood to meant that they would be accepting responsibility. In its defence, the defendant once again admitted that the claimant was in the employ of the defendant at the material time. Trial was fixed in July 2005 under an expedited procedure. By the middle of June 2005, it dawned upon the defendant that it was actually not liable to the claimant because it was not the employer at the material time. The actual employer had been dissolved. The defendant was one of the companies within the group that acquired the actual employer prior to its dissolution. It took out an application to withdraw the earlier admission.

18     The English High Court found that allowing the withdrawal of the admission would cause the claimant to suffer real prejudice, the greatest being that the trial may not take place during his lifetime. While the application was undoubtedly made in good faith and the defendant clearly had very good prospects of succeeding on the issue without the admission having been made, these were outweighed by the real risk that the claimant would be deprived of a trial within his lifetime, which was a serious prejudice that cannot be adequately compensated by costs. And while it might be said that the delay in making the application came only about two months after the admission was made, which was a fairly short period of time, in the circumstances of this case, that two months was, in Judge Hegarty QC’s words “almost literally a lifetime”. Also weighing against the defendant was the fact that he gave no clear explanation as to why the admissions were made and maintained, and that even if they were found liable, the could well pass on liability to the insurers of the correct defendant under the UK Civil Liability Contribution Act 1978.

19     In the present case, the Defendant argued that claimants seeking to withdraw admissions must furnish good reasons, referring to Australian decisions that says the explanation must be a sensible one based on “evidence of a solid and substantial character” (see for instance _Re Rocco Celestino v Antonio Celestino_ <span class="citation">\[1990\] FCA 299</span> (“_Re Rocco Celestino_”) cited in _Independent State of Papua New Guinea v PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 19</span> (“_Papua New Guinea v PNG_”) at \[134\] in relation to the doctrine of estoppel). While the English cases did not use the exact same expression, the substantive inquiry in my view is not dissimilar. As would be apparent from the foregoing decisions, English courts have routinely considered the reasons furnished by the applicant. Though Millett LJ did not find it necessary to insist on reasons in _Gale v Superdrug_, he nevertheless went on to consider the reasons furnished by the applicant. Waite LJ’s judgement in _Gale v Superdrug_ was the only one that did not consider the applicant’s reasons. The other decisions discussed above have all done so. In other instances, where no good reasons are given and where the evidence reveals the application to be opportunistic, English courts have refused leave to withdraw an admission (see _Braybrook v Basildon & Thurrock University NHS Trust_ \[2004\] EWHC 335).

20     In my judgment, an applicant seeking the court’s indulgence to withdraw admissions should ordinarily furnish good reasons. This is in keeping with the principle that amendments to pleadings must be made in good faith (_Wright Norman_ at \[26\]). The requisite threshold for what constitutes a good reason however cannot be reduced to a rigid formula. It is ultimately an exercise of discretion. Similarly, the contours and content of the evidence required to prove a good reason takes the shape of the factual matrix of each case.

21     Sufficiency of reasons is not the sole criterion by which such applications are assessed. As would be apparent from the foregoing discussion, English courts generally prefer to consider all relevant circumstances of the case. Another key factor often considered is the balance of prejudice. In this regard, the court considers the prejudice from the perspective of both the applicant and the respondent. From the applicant’s perspective, the court examines what prejudice would the applicant suffer if the withdrawal is disallowed. From the respondent’s perspective, the court examines what prejudice would the respondent suffer if the withdrawal is allowed. A balance is then struck between the prejudice that may be suffered by either party. Aside from these questions, the court also asks itself whether any of the parties was the author of the prejudice suffered. In my judgment, this approach is sound and correct.

22     Australian courts adopt a similar approach. It is very much a balancing exercise. The case of _Re Rocco Celestino_ aptly demonstrates how the court engages in this exercise. This was a motor accident case which proceeded to trial. When the trial commenced, the defendant admitted liability and agreed for the trial to proceed as an assessment of damages. The trial proceeded this way. On the sixth day of trial, because of certain answers given by the claimant during his cross-examination, the defendant applied to withdraw the admission of liability. The claimant’s evidence which prompted the application was to the effect that the accident happened when a woman was driving another car overtook in circumstances which caused the defendant to swing left to avoid colliding with the overtaking car, and this in turned caused the defendant’s car to leave the carriageway. On this version of the accident, the defendant wanted to argue that the accident occurred without his negligence, as he was justified in taking evasive action.

23     The Federal Court of Australia dismissed the defendant’s application because the defendant failed to produce any material to indicate what steps he had taken to verify the circumstances of the accident. In fact, the claimant’s account of events was made known to the defendant even before trial, which meant that the defendant would have made an informed decision in admitting liability. Further, the defendant made no mention of the overtaking vehicle and his attempt to take evasive action in the written report of the accident which was submitted to his insurer. The application appeared to have been opportunistic in these circumstances. Apart from the suspect motivations, the court also found that the withdrawal is likely to result in serious prejudice. A good _eight years_ had passed since the accident. During this time, memories of witnesses and the parties would likely have faded and the lines of enquiry would likely have turned cold. This would have prevented the claimant from taking meaningful steps to marshal together evidence to prove its case on liability.

24      _Bank of Western Australia Ltd v Coppola_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] NSWSC 1326</span> (“_Coppola_”) (also cited with approval in _Papua New Guinea v PNG_ for the doctrine of estoppel) is another Australian decision that merits brief discussion. The first defendant in this case sought leave to withdraw an admission made by his former solicitors in a document titled “Notice Disputing Facts and Authenticity of Documents” which stated that the first defendant admitted that he signed a power of attorney but did not know the substance of effect of the said document and was misled as to the nature and effect of the said document. The explanation given by the first defendant was that he was not aware that his former solicitors had issued the said document and did not instruct his former solicitors that he had signed the power of attorney. Dissatisfied with the explanation, the Supreme Court of New South Wales refused leave to withdraw the admission. In its judgment, the court highlighted that the first defendant did not say that the admission was erroneous or deny having signed the power of attorney. Considering the whole of the evidence, there was no dispute factually that he did sign the power of attorney, even casting aside his admission. Since the admission was consistent with the undisputed evidence showing that he signed the power of attorney, it would be futile to allow the withdrawal (at \[41\]).

25     In short, while leave was eventually refused in _Re Rocco Celestino_ and _Coppola_ on the particular facts, the underlying analysis shows that – as a matter of law – Australian courts similarly undertake a balancing test when deciding whether to allow withdrawal of admissions. Key factors typically considered include the sufficiency of the reasons; the issue of prejudice; and whether the undisputed evidence renders it futile to withdraw the admission.

26     The Defendant referred me to Indian cases adopting a much more stringent test on applications to withdraw admissions. _Modi Spinning & Weaving Mills Co v Ladha Ram & Co_ 1977 AIR 680 (“_Modi Spinning_”) was one of them. In that case, the defendants initially admitted in their written statement that the claimant worked as their “stockist-cum-distributor”. Three years later, the defendants sought leave to amend the written statement to read that the claimant was a “mercantile agent-cum-purchaser”. The lower court dismissed the application and that decision was upheld by the Supreme Court of India, which held that the defendants could not freely “substitute an entirely different and new case”. The reason given was that the amendments would “irretrievably prejudice” the claimant who would be “denied the opportunity of extracting the admission from the defendants”. I declined to follow _Modi Spinning_. In my view, the test is overly stringent. In every application to withdraw an admission the opposing party would necessarily be deprived of the opportunity to rely on the admission if the application were allowed. By those standards, no party would ever be allowed to withdraw an admission, regardless of the reasons and the circumstances. Not only is this prone to producing unjust outcomes, the advocated test is also wholly inconsistent with the well-established principles governing amendment of pleadings. The law on amendment of pleadings is such that amendments should not be refused solely because they have been made necessary by the honest fault or mistake of the party seeking leave, as it is not the function of the court to punish parties for their mistakes (_Wright Norman_ at \[25\]). The test in _Modi Spinning_ achieves the exact opposite effect of precluding parties from rectifying even honest and non-prejudicial mistakes. The other Indian case cited by the Defendant, _Uttam Chand Kothari v Gauri Shankar Jalan and others_ AIR 2007 Gau 20, was a High Court decision which was bound to follow _Modi Spinning_ as a matter of stare decisis, and as such does not take the Defendant’s case any further.

27     In sum, I consider the following non-exhaustive list of factors to be relevant in assessing applications to withdraw admissions made in pleadings:

> (a)     what are the reasons for making the admission and withdrawing the admission;

> (b)     what are the chances of the applicant succeeding on the issue(s) on which the admission may bear if the admission were withdrawn;

> (c)     whether either party would suffer irreparable prejudice if the withdrawal is allowed or disallowed, and the balance of prejudice; and

> (d)     whether either party was the true author of any prejudice suffered.

28     In my judgment, this multi-factorial balancing test accords with the general principle for amendment of pleadings laid down by the Court of Appeal in _Wright Norman_ (see \[9\] above). Ultimately, these factors are proxies to the real inquiry – where does the balance of convenience and justice lie? It is a fact-sensitive question that must be determined on a case-by-case basis. As the Court of Appeal further held in _Asia Business Forum Pte Ltd v Long Ai Sin and another_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 2 SLR(R) 173</span> (“_Asia Business Forum_”) at \[12\], the court should have regard to the “justice of the case” in deciding whether to allow the amendment.

### Present facts

29     Turning to the present case, the affidavits and the submissions indicated that the Plaintiff had left the matter to be handled by his solicitors and only came to realise the error when his solicitors was preparing for the PTC. While the reasons and materials furnished by the Plaintiff were not entirely satisfactory, they were sufficient to move my discretion. There was no overt evidence or indication that this was done as a tactical manoeuvre or in bad faith. The delay in taking out this application was also not unduly long: between the filing of the Statement of Claim on 29 May 2019 and the filing of the present application on 14 January 2020, about six months had passed. While certainly not insignificant, the delay was not inordinate. In the intervening period, parties attended several court dispute resolution (“CDR”) sessions and a PTC. AEICs were also filed. But trial dates had not been taken.

30     The Defendant cited several cases where leave was refused; but most of those involved applications taken out after trial had commenced and were understandably subjected to a much stricter standard.

> (a)     In _Ong Kai Hian v Tan Hong Suan Cecilia and others_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGHC 58</span>, leave was refused because the amendments to the statement of claim – made after trial – required the defendants, some of whom were elderly, to put up a different defence (at \[30\]-\[31\]).

> (b)     In _Romar Positioning Equipment Pte Ltd v Merriwa Nominees Pty Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 4 SLR(R) 574</span>, the delay in taking out the amendment was unjustified as the respondent became aware of the change in stance only on the first day of trial (at \[38\]) and no explanation was given for the delay (at \[41\]).

> (c)     In _Sin Leng Industries Pte Ltd v Ong Chai Teck and others_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] SGHC 25</span>, the plaintiff sought to amend its statement of claim only in the second week of trial. The proposed amendment was not a mere clarification but a drastic change of position. The respondent submitted that it would require time to respond to the different case and seek further and better particulars on the same. The court was not prepared to vacate the trial dates (at \[31\] and \[42\]).

> (d)     In _Toh Kheng Boon v NTUC Income Insurance Co-operative Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] SGDC 257</span>, the application was filed two days before trial and heard on the first day of trial, without any supporting affidavit filed to explain the delay (at \[18\]). The court further found that the proposed amendments were flawed to begin with and did not achieve the objective of defining the issues in dispute (at \[17\]). Further, the amendments would take the respondent by surprise and require new evidence to be adduced which would delay the trial (at \[19\]).

31     These decisions are in my view consistent with the principle expressed by the Court of Appeal that the later an application is made, the stronger the grounds required to justify it (_Asia Business Forum_ at \[12\]). As the Court of Appeal noted in _Chwee Kin Cheong v Digilandmall.com Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 1 SLR(R) 502</span> at \[101\], the court must bear in mind the caution issued by Lord Griffiths in _Ketteman v Hansel Properties Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1987\] AC 189</span> at 220:

>     \[T\]o allow an amendment before a trial begins is quite different from allowing it at the end of the trial to give an apparently unsuccessful defendant an opportunity to renew the fight on an entirely different defence.

It bears emphasis that the present amendment application was taken out before trial. This materially distinguished the present facts from the cases discussed above.

32     Further, I was satisfied the Plaintiff had a plausible case on the tyre not being (fully) punctured at the relevant time. The Plaintiff’s case was that there was no tyre puncture and the collision resulted from the Defendant’s negligent driving. Based on the photographs, it was not abundantly clear that the tyre was (fully) punctured – or ruptured. The tyre appeared to be inflated to some extent – at least sufficiently for the vehicle to be driven for short distances. I also noted that the Plaintiff’s accident statement and police report made no mention of the alleged tyre puncture. His account of events, as recorded in the accident statement and police report, was that the Defendant’s car swerved and collided into his without warning. The proposed amendments were consistent with the narrative recorded in these contemporaneous documents.

33     All things considered, I was inclined to give the Plaintiff the benefit of doubt that the Plaintiff’s solicitors mistakenly drafted the Statement of Claim by reference to the Defendant’s accident statement and only came to realise the error when he was preparing for the PTC.

34     While the Plaintiff and his solicitors could have picked up the error earlier, that by itself is not a reason to prevent the Plaintiff from correcting the error. As the Court of Appeal held in _Wright Norman_, pleadings should not be used as a means to punish a party for his errors or the errors of his solicitors. The following passages in that case are instructive:

>     25 In our judgment, there is really only one set of rules which apply to amendment of pleadings, whatever be the cause or matter. They were summarised by Lord Brandon of Oakbrook in _Ketteman v Hansel Properties_ (\[24\] _supra_) at 212F, which we would respectfully adopt:

>> The effect of these authorities can, I think, be summarised in the following four propositions. First, all such amendments should be made as are necessary to enable the real questions in controversy between the parties to be decided. Secondly, amendments should not be refused solely because they have been made necessary by the honest fault or mistake of the party applying for leave to make them: it is not the function of the court to punish parties for mistakes which they have made in the conduct of their cases by deciding otherwise than in accordance with their rights. Thirdly, however blameworthy (short of bad faith) may have been a party’s failure to plead the subject matter of a proposed amendment earlier, and however late the application for leave to make such amendment may have been, the application should, in general, be allowed, provided that allowing it will not prejudice the other party. Fourthly, there is no injustice to the other party if he can be compensated by appropriate orders as to costs.

>     26 We find support in what we hold herein in an unreported decision of the English Court of Appeal in _Carmen Proetta v Times Newspapers Ltd_ (unreported), where an amendment was made ten days before trial to introduce a restricted defence of justification. The judge allowed the amendment which decision was upheld on appeal. Taylor LJ said:

>> If, through lack of earlier insight or a change of mind, a defendant realizes, albeit at a late stage, that the pleadings do not set out his real case, there must be some measure of injustice should he not be allowed to plead and argue it. The extent of the injustice and how it compares with the injustice to the plaintiff of allowing a late amendment is a matter for the judge’s discretion.

35     As for the issue of prejudice, I was not satisfied that the Defendant would be irreparably prejudiced by the withdrawal of the admission. The Defendant claimed that “since the issue of the tyre puncture had never been in dispute, I had not retained nor thought to retain any evidence pertaining to the punctured tyre”. This may be read to mean that the tyre was never retained as evidence, even before the onset of this action. Notably, the Defendant did not positively say that he disposed of the tyre in reliance of the Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim. I say this because the accident took place on 14 January 2018, more than a year before the Plaintiff commenced proceedings. If the Defendant had wanted to retain the tyre as evidence, he would have done so when his vehicle was sent for repair after the accident. Yet nowhere in his affidavit did he say that he had retained the tyre after the accident and disposed of it only after having sight of the Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim. Even after the Plaintiff had raised this concern in his reply affidavit, the Defendant did not come forward to assert otherwise. In my view, the disposal of the tyre had no established nexus with the admission made by the Plaintiff.

36     In any event, even without the admission, it was still open to the Defendant to call the car mechanic and/or adduce documentary evidence from the workshop to prove that his vehicle suffered a tyre puncture. Memories of witnesses may have faded, but that is part and parcel of litigation of this sort involving a car mechanic who has probably serviced many other vehicles with a similar defect. What is material is that the delay in this case was not inordinate. Further, if the Defendant were serious about proving the tyre puncture, he could and should have secured witness statements right after the repair, to preserve the necessary evidence.

37     Besides the car mechanic, it was open to the Defendant to call other experts to testify as to the condition of the tyre based on the photographs adduced. There was no material to suggest that the experts would be unable to provide credible testimony based on the available photographs of the tyre.

38     In these circumstances, the delay of six months in bringing this application was not so inordinate as to prevent the Defendant from gathering meaningful evidence to prove his case. Conversely, refusing the Plaintiff leave to retract the averment would prevent him from leading evidence to refute the Defendant’s contention that his car suffered a punctured tyre and that it was the tyre puncture that caused his car to skid and collide into the Plaintiff’s vehicle. The balance of prejudice in this case weighed in favour of the Plaintiff.

39     In all the circumstances of the case, the justice of the case dictated that the amendments be allowed. The amendments were necessary for the issue in controversy, _viz._ was the collision an inevitable accident or was it caused by Defendant’s negligent driving, to be canvassed at trial. As a consequential order, I granted parties leave to file and exchange supplementary affidavits of evidence-in-chief, if any, including reports from expert witnesses, on the issue of whether the Defendant’s vehicle had a tyre puncture at the time of the accident.

## Conclusion

40     For the above reasons, I allowed the application.

41     Even though the Plaintiff succeeded in obtaining leave, I ordered costs of the application against him, since the application was occasioned by his and his solicitor’s oversight. The solicitor had carelessly drafted the Statement of Claim based on the Defendant’s accident statement. The Plaintiff should have checked the Statement of Claim and alerted the solicitor of the error when it was still in draft form. The quantum of the costs should however be discounted to reflect that outcome of the contested hearing. The Defendant submitted $800 plus reasonable disbursements, and I so ordered.
