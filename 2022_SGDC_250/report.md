\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9195/2022/01.\]

26 October 2022

### District Judge Tan Jen Tse:

## Introduction

1       In the early hours of 4 August 2019, the accused was at _Rumours_, a club located at No 5 Koek Road, Cuppage Plaza. At around 3.49 a.m., a riot broke out when the accused and 17 other co-accused persons attacked five victims.

2       This led to the following charge being preferred against the accused:-

**Charge (DAC 911976-2020)**

> … that you, on the 4 August 2019, at or about 3.49 a.m., at No. 5 Koek Road, Cuppage Plaza, Rumours, Singapore, together with Vineshnathan S/O Ragunathan, Selvastanlly S/O Selvarajan, Pradhif Kumar S/O Rasu, T Kishanthan, D Arjuna, Steven Raj S/O Sagadevan, M Dipan, Joseph Raja S/O Paul Vincent, Metash, Vasudevan S/O Rajagopal, Subash S/O A Rahdakrishnan, Muhammad Hafiz Bin Nuryusof, Evineshvaran S/O Selluraji, Noorul Amin S/O Noor Mohamed, Jude Philomon, K Sathish Kumar, and Kishan Kumar S/O Nanthakumar, were members of an unlawful assembly whose common object was to voluntarily cause hurt to at least 5 subjects, namely, Rajamanikem S/O Sivalingam, K Khirthan, Ryan Dave S/O Ravi, Baskaran S/O Govindapani, and Darren Dave S/O Ravi, and in the prosecution of the said common object, one or more of you did use violence by throwing a pitcher and a table as well as punching to assault one or more of the said subjects, and you have thereby committed an offence of rioting under Section 146 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Penal Code”) which is punishable under Section 147 of the Penal Code.

3       The prescribed punishment for this offence is a term of imprisonment which may extend to seven years and a liability to caning.

4       The accused, male, 31 years old, pleaded guilty to the charge and was sentenced to 17 months’ imprisonment and to three strokes of the cane.

5       One further charge was taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing: the accused had gathered for drinks and conversation in a group of more than two individuals outside his place of residence on 1 June 2021 at around 2.50 a.m., which was in breach of the covid-19 regulations then in force.

6       The accused has filed an appeal against sentence. Bail pending appeal was offered on 4 October 2022 and he was released on bail on 5 October 2022.

> 4.    The accused and co-accused will be collectively referred to as “the accused’s group” in this SOF.

> **FIRST INFORMATION REPORT**

> 5.    On 4 August 2019 at 3.44 am, Police received a “999” call stating “There are people breaking bottles here now.” The location was provided as Rumours located at No. 5 Koek Road Singapore 228796, Cuppage Plaza (“the Club”).

> **THE FIRST PUNCH**

> 6.    On 4 August 2019, the accused’s group was in the Club. The victims were also in the Club and were seated together in the sofa area.

> 7.    At about 3.47 a.m. on the same day, V5 felt a push when B14 (Hafiz) walked past him in the Club. V5 then got into a dispute with B14 (Hafiz). At that point, B9 (Dipan) was standing next to B14 (Hafiz). To prevent the dispute from escalating further, V3 immediately got up from his seat and danced between B14 (Hafiz) and V5.

> 8.    At this moment, V1 joined V5 in confronting B14 (Hafiz), leading B15 (Evinesh) to come towards them and separate the parties. However, B9 (Dipan), who was standing behind B15 (Evinesh) suddenly stretched out to forcefully punch V1 on his face.

> 9.    After the punch, the bouncers switched on the lights of the Club while V1 returned to the sofa area with a swollen eye and told his group (V2 – V5) about the punch:

> \[photograph omitted\]

> **THE GROUP ATTACK**

> 10.    When V4 heard about the punch and saw the injury on V1’s eye, V4 shouted towards the accused’s group and asked why they hit V1. B15 (Evinesh) shouted back angrily. Suddenly, B9 (Dipan) punched V3 on the side of his face, while some of the co-accused persons pushed themselves towards V4.

> 11.    Thereafter, at about 3.49 a.m. the accused’s group commenced their attack on the victims. In the attack, B18 (Sathish) threw a mug towards the victims, while B9 (Dipan) threw a pitcher, which hit V4. At about the same time, B16 (Noorul Amin) repeatedly hit V5 on the head with a bottle. The accused took a pitcher and threw it towards the victims. B1 (Joseph Raja) similarly took things from the table and threw them at the victims’ direction. V3 then pulled B16 (Noorul Amin) away from V5. After B16 was pulled away, B9 (Dipan) threw a cup at V5 who managed to get away from the sofa area soon after. Following that, B11 (Metash), B14 (Hafiz), B15 (Evinesh) and B17 (Jude Philomon) threw cups and pitchers at V4. B15 (Evinesh) and B17 (Jude Philomon) also punched V4. About this time, B10 (Selvastanlly) threw a container filled with ice, which he picked up from a table nearby, towards the victims.

> \[there is no paragraph 12 in the SOF\]

> 13.    At one point, V4 was shielding himself from the items thrown at him by the accused’s group when B9 (Dipan) came towards him and punched him repeatedly. At about the same time, the accused took a table and threw it towards V4. Soon after, the accused’s group crowded around V1, V2 and V4 and started attacking them with punches. In the 3 course of the attack, B9 (Dipan) got up onto the sofa and repeatedly stomped and kicked V1, V2 and V4 who were by then cornered to a side of the sofa by the accused’s group. Around this time, the accused threw punches at one of the victims.

> 14.    As B9 (Dipan) was stomping and kicking V1, V2 and V4, the others in the accused’s group were punching and kicking them and attacking them with glass bottles. Some in the accused’s group, including B10 (Selvastanlly), B14 (Hafiz) and B9 (Dipan) also carried a table and threw it towards V1, V2 and V4. At one point, B14 (Hafiz) also lifted the table alone and flung it towards V1, V2 and V4 again.

> 15.    The attack on the victims only ceased when B17 (Jude Philomon) stopped his group from assaulting the victims any further. B12 (Vasudevan) also grabbed B9 (Dipan) to direct him away from the fracas towards the tail end of the attack. B4 Pradhif and B15 (Evinesh) also tried to direct some of the accused persons away from the fracas.

> **ACCUSED’S INDIVIDUAL INVOLVEMENT**

> 16.    CCTV footage from the club captured the events of the riot.

> 17.    A table identifying each accused person from the footage is annexed in Tab A.

> 18.    The salient points of the accused’s participation in the riot, as captured by the CCTV, are as follows:

> **CONCLUSION**

> 20.    The accused was a member of an unlawful assembly with the co-accused persons, whose common object was to cause hurt to V1-V5, and in the prosecution of the said common object, at least one member of said unlawful assembly did use violence by throwing a pitcher and a table as well as punching to assault one or more of the said victims, and the accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 147 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

## Sentencing considerations

### Parties’ position on sentence

8       The prosecution submitted for a sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane. For offences under s 147 of the Penal Code, _The Sentencing Practice of the Subordinate Courts (3rd Edition, 2013)_ states (at page 377):-

> While the case precedents indicate that the usual range of imprisonment for ‘non-secret society related’ cases is from 18 to 24 months, however, this is not always so as every case turns on its facts. For example; see PP v Mohd Jeffri bin Ithnin (MA 349/2000) where the sentence was enhanced to three years’ imprisonment and nine strokes on appeal. Where the level of violence was minimal, a sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment has been meted out by the courts; see Robin Anak Mawang v PP <span class="citation">\[2006\] 1 SLR(R) 373</span> where offender kicked the victim once, or Foong Yuen Kuang v PP (MA 308/2009) where the offender had instigated others to challenge the police but no physical violence involved.

9       The prosecution contended that this was consistent with the observation of the High Court in _Phua Song Hua v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGHC 33</span> at \[42\], where it noted that for rioting, the courts have consistently imposed between 18 to 36 months’ imprisonment with three to 12 strokes of the cane.[^1]

10     In his written Plea-in-Mitigation, counsel stated that the “Defence leaves sentencing of the custodial term to the court.” He submitted that only one stroke of the cane should be imposed as the accused had a sad childhood and as his role was relatively minor.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) In his oral submissions, counsel submitted that no caning should be imposed as the accused played a peripheral role. He added that if caning were to be imposed, it should be limited to one stroke.[^3]

### Calibration of sentence

11     The sentencing principles engaged in rioting cases would be deterrence and retribution. In the present case, the court also had to ensure parity of sentence with the co-accused persons.

#### Aggravating factors

12     As submitted by the prosecution, the following offence-specific aggravating factors were present:-[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4)

> (a)     large scale of the riot;

> (b)     high degree of violence displayed by the accused persons;

> (c)     serious injuries caused to multiple victims;

> (d)     potential harm to other patrons of the club; and

> (e)     use of cups, pitchers and tables during the attacks. The accused himself flung a pitcher at the victims and later flung a table at them.

13     The offender-specific aggravating factor was the accused’s antecedent for rioting. On 11 May 2015, the accused was placed on 24 months’ probation (with time restrictions from 2300 to 0600 hours) for a similar offence. He was also ordered to perform 180 hours of community work.

#### Mitigating factors

14     In the Plea-in-Mitigation, counsel stated that the accused had suffered from asthma since he was nine years old when his father passed away. His father’s death left a void in his life, which he filled with friends who had a negative impact on him. However, as these personal circumstances were not exceptional, no weight could be attributed to these. The only significant mitigating factor was the accused’s plea of guilt, which indicated his remorse.

#### Parity of sentence

15     Seven co-accused persons had pleaded guilty to offences arising out of the same events. The prosecution stated that sentences of between 15 months and two weeks to 24 months’ imprisonment, with three strokes of the cane were meted out to the co-accused persons who were above 21 years old at the time of the offence. It provided a table of sentencing information on the co-accused persons, which is reproduced for ease of reference:-[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5)

16     The prosecution stated that three strokes of the cane was generally meted out to the co-accused persons who used implements such as tables or broken glass bottles. However, for those with exceptional mitigating factors such as Jude Philomon who had tried to stop the fight, no caning was imposed.[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6)

17     The accused had thrown a pitcher and a table at the victims. He caused hurt by repeatedly punching one or more of the victims. His role could be compared with that of Muhammad Hafiz Bin Nuryusof (“Hafiz”). Hafiz picked up a pitcher from the floor, threw it at the victims and punched them. Together with other co-accused, he lifted a table and flung it at them. He then lifted another table, flung it at the victims and threw more punches. Hafiz, who had unrelated antecedents, was sentenced to 16 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane.

18     The prosecution agreed that in terms of individual roles, a comparison with Hafiz would be apt since he also flung a table at the victims. Counsel conceded that the court “…is bound by the sentence that Hafiz has been given \[and\] in light of the fact that he has thrown – also chucked the table at one of the victims…”.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7)

#### Sentence

19     The appropriate starting point in assessing the accused’s sentence was 16 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane. This was on par with the sentence imposed on Hafiz. It was a downward calibration from the prosecution’s proposed sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane. Although Hafiz’s conduct was more egregious as he threw two tables and twice threw punches at the victims, he offended at the relatively young age of 22 years, whereas the accused was 29 years old at the time of the offence.

20     Unlike Hafiz, the accused had an antecedent for rioting for which he was placed on 24 months’ probation on 11 May 2015. He committed the present offence only about two and a half years after his probation period ended. He had clearly not learnt from his previous offence, and some measure of specific deterrence was necessary. In my view, an uplift of one month’s imprisonment was warranted. The sentence imposed was therefore 17 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane.
