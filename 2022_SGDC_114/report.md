### District Judge Kaur Jasvender:

1       The accused was convicted after a trial of one charge of cheating by falsely representing that he would carry out a currency exchange and remittance transaction and thereby dishonestly induced the delivery of a sum of S$596,050 on 22 February 2019, an offence under s 420 Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008), one charge of converting S$345,000 of the criminal proceeds of cheating by purchasing a Patek Philippe ‘Nautilus’ watch on 22 February 2019, an offence under s 47(1)(b) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 65A, Rev Ed 2000) (‘CDSA’), and one charge of using $63,000 of the criminal proceeds of cheating to pay his credit card bill on 22 February 2019, an offence under s 47(1)(c) of the CDSA.

2       He was sentenced to 54 months’ imprisonment on the s 420 charge, 24 months’ imprisonment on the s 47(1)(b) charge and eight months’ imprisonment on the s 47(1)(c) charge. The 54-month and the eight-month terms were ordered to run consecutively. The total sentence was therefore sixty-two months’ imprisonment. He has appealed against that conviction and sentence.

## Prosecution’s case

3       The salient aspects of the evidence of the 14 prosecution witnesses is summarised below.

### Evidence of PW1 – Koh Hui Keong @ Roy (‘Roy’)

4       Roy is self-employed. He has multiple businesses relating to the marine and motor trade which are conducted through a Malaysian registered company known as WTCC Limited.

5       He testified that one Kunitomo Shoji (‘Shoji’), who is a shareholder in Yanase Trading in Japan, was engaged as a consultant for WTCC Limited. Shoji was paid commission or referral fees in US dollars. The payments were made by telegraphic transfer to Shoji’s local bank account with Bank of Singapore.

6       In early 2019, Roy was required to make a payment of S$600,000 in US dollars to Shoji. He testified that he complained to his friend, Chen Jun An @ Sean (‘Sean’) who works in Bank of Singapore (‘BOS’), about bank exchange rates. Roy and Sean met when they were studying in the same junior college. Sean told him that he (Sean) would be able to obtain a better rate from money changers that he knows. Roy agreed to do the transaction through a moneychanger instead. He was informed of the exchange rate quoted by a moneychanger. However, he was no longer able to remember the difference in the exchange rate which Sean informed him and the bank exchange rate.

7       He passed S$600,000 cash in $1,000 denomination notes to Sean. He did not withdraw the cash but had it with him. He did not know which moneychanger was going to be used. He did not ask because he trusted Sean.

8       After a few days of handing the money to Sean, Roy came to know from Shoji that he did not receive the money. He asked Sean about it. He was told that there is a hiccup and the problem will be rectified. Subsequently, he was informed by Sean that the money was not remitted by the person to whom the money was eventually passed to and the money was missing.

9       Roy panicked ‘a bit’. However, he said his position was that he would hold Sean responsible for the loss. A few months later, he was informed by Shoji that he has received the money. Roy was not aware how the transfer was eventually made.

10     With respect to the purported proof of telegraphic transfer (exhibit P10), he initially said that he was shown the document by Sean after the purported transfer. Under cross-examination, Roy was referred to his police statement which he made in the course of investigations on 16 October 2019 (exhibit D1) wherein he stated that he does not recall seeing exhibit P10. Roy confirmed the accuracy of the contents of the statement that he gave to the police, and then said that P10 was not shown to him by Sean. He explained that he was confused earlier because he had seen P10 in the course of investigations and during his interview with the prosecutors.

### Evidence of PW2 – Chen Jun An @ Sean (‘Sean’)

11     Sean is a banker with the BOS. He has known Roy since 2016. He knew Roy was a businessman in the automotive business.

12     He knew Roy’s business associate, Shoji, as Shoji was his private banking client who has a bank account with BOS. He said there were prior transactions where Roy had asked him to transfer funds to Shoji via the bank using the bank’s board rate.

13     In February 2019, Roy informed him that he needed to transfer S$600,000 in US dollars to Shoji. Sean told Roy that he knows someone who will be able to give him a good exchange rate compared to the bank’s rate. Roy told him to go ahead and check. Sean had in mind Jay Tan Jing Yang (‘Jay’) who was an agent for licensed money changers. Sean had done some personal money exchange transactions through Jay. He came to know Jay when they were in the same secondary school and they were also in the same junior college.

14     Sean informed Jay of the S$600,000 transaction. On 22 February 2019 at 11.42am, Jay sent a WhatsApp message to Sean to ask if the transaction of S$600,000 was going ahead, and if so, he could obtain the conversion rate to US dollars. Sean replied that the money was to be remitted by telegraphic transfer in US dollars to the bank account of the client. After checking with Roy if he had the cash, Sean confirmed that the transaction will be done in the afternoon on the same day.

15     At 11.55am, Jay asked for the bank account details of the client to whom the money was to be remitted. Sean forwarded Shoji’s bank account details. At 1.23pm, Jay messaged that the exchange rate is 1.3585. Sean replied ‘Ok’ and asked Jay to collect the money at around 3pm at his office at Market Street. At 2.46pm, Sean messaged, “Client rate is XE rate is 1% 1.367”. Sean explained that ‘XE’ referred to the App which is used to check the spot exchange rate. He said the difference between the two rates was the commission that was to be shared between Jay and himself, which would amount to about USD2,746.

16     At 2.52pm, Jay again asked for the beneficiary details. Sean replied that he had sent it earlier but forwarded the details again. Sean asked for a receipt evidencing the transfer and enquired which company will be used. Sean explained that he asked for a receipt because the bank would require a receipt from a licensed moneychanger as proof to support the inflow of funds to Shoji’s account. He said that he also required a screenshot or a MT103 to evidence that the remittance had been done. Jay told him that he is enquiring and that the transaction was safe.

17     At 3.36pm, Jay messaged Sean that he was reaching the workplace in five minutes. This was in order to collect the S$600,000. Sean testified that Roy had earlier passed him the S$600,000 in cash in six bundles of $1,000 notes. He passed the money to Jay when he arrived.

18     It was Sean’s evidence that he did not know which money changer was to be used when he handed the monies to Jay. He assumed that JC Money Change would be used because Jay had previously given him the name card of that company. He said that as he was expecting a receipt, he did not enquire further again.

19     As the transaction was done quite late in the afternoon on a Friday, Sean expected the money to be remitted on Tuesday (26th) or Wednesday (27th). He then started to chase Jay for a screenshot to show that the money had been transferred or a MT103 to evidence the transfer. He made many phone calls to Jay to chase him for the proof but Jay told him that he was also chasing his side. Between 3rd to 5th March 2019, Jay told him that he has been cheated of the money. Sean was taken aback and said he was angry at Jay.

20     He said that Jay admitted that a licensed money changer was not used. He told Jay that he would have to be responsible for the loss. Jay accepted full responsibility. He said Jay made partial payment of $300,000. Sean paid the balance sum in order to make the full payment to Shoji.

21     Asked if he had seen the MT103 in P10, he said that he was not sure as he is unable to locate any WhatsApp message which shows that it was sent to him.

22     Sean informed Roy of what had happened. He said Roy’s position was that he had passed the money and the money was owing to Shoji and he was therefore not responsible.

23     Under cross-examination, Sean said that he is unable to remember if Roy had handed him cash on the previous occasions when he transmitted funds to Shoji. He said all the past transactions were done using the bank’s board rate. Sean knew the turnover of Roy’s automotive business was about 20 million per year, and he therefore did not consider S$600,000 to be a big sum in Roy’s possession. He added that the automotive business can be ‘cash intensive’ at times.

24     He explained that Roy needed to pay Shoji, and he had merely tried to broker the deal through Jay to get a better rate. He was unable to remember the bank rate in February 2019. He stated that as a general guide, ‘XE plus 1%’ could be better than the bank’s board rate, but it would not be worse off than the bank’s board rate.

25     He said the messages on 3rd March 2019 where he had sent a screenshot of the XE App exchange rate and stated “Pls settle it asap” pertained to the transaction and he was chasing Jay to credit the US dollars to forward to Shoji. He said he does not have proof that Jay paid $300,000 and he (Sean) paid the balance sum due to the lapse of more than two years and because the entire sum was not remitted to Shoji in one lump sum but in tranches in the course of 2019. He said he has an IOU from Jay stating that he is responsible for the loss of the monies.

26     He was asked about Jay’s message on 5th March 2019 where he stated, “_Bro. I settle the case properly. The money will be settled by me. Don’t worry about that. Just need to dont say wrong to IO first, Knn_”. Sean explained that he was aware a police report had been made and the culprit had been arrested. He said he was angry and had threatened to report Jay because he had not met the actual culprit and, as far as he was concerned, he had been cheated by Jay.

### Evidence of PW3 – Tan Jing Yang @ Jay (‘Jay’)

27     Jay used to be in the remittance trade with CYS Global Remit Private Limited between 2013 and 2014. Thereafter, he did freelance work of introducing clients to remittance agencies, namely, JC Global Remit, Koku, Jade Exchange and Hanshan Exchange. He earned a commission based on the difference between the rates quoted by the companies and the rates which he quoted to his clients.

28     Jay came to know Sean during secondary school. They also attended the same junior college. When Jay was in the remittance trade, Sean had exchanged money through him for his personal travels.

29     In 2019, Sean introduced him to Roy. Sometime later, Sean told him that Roy wanted to exchange SGD 600,000 to USD in order to transfer to a bank account via a remittance company. Jay then sourced for companies that could carry out the transaction. Jay was given the name and the bank account details of the beneficiary. Jay was only able to remember that part of the name of the beneficiary was Kunitomo.

30     Jay enquired about the exchange rate from JC Global and Koku. He also asked Wong Si Si Rosanna (‘Rosanna’), who is a property agent, for the exchange rate. He came to know her whilst attending religious classes as they have the same Buddhist master. He said that she has a reputation of being a trustworthy person. He stated that he had previously asked Rosanna for exchange rates for remittances but no deals were done as the rates were not favourable. Nevertheless, he decided to ask her again for the exchange rate for Roy’s transaction.

31     He told Rosanna that the rate must be from a licensed remittance company and he would require a receipt as proof that the monies were received by a licensed remittance company and a screenshot of the funds transfer or a MT103 as proof of the transfer. Rosanna acknowledged the requirements. She quoted a rate which was better than the rate the other remittance companies had offered. He did not know from which remittance company she had obtained the rate but believed that it would be just as safe as the other remittance companies that he had dealt with.

32     Jay was not able to remember the date of the transaction. He recollected that it was done on a Friday. At 11.42am, he texted Sean to ask if the transaction would be done, and if so, he would get the exchange rate right away. Sean replied that it would be a telegraphic transfer in USD and he would check if the transaction is going ahead. At 11.47am, Sean confirmed that the transaction will be done on the same day after lunch. At 11.55am, Jay asked for the account details of the beneficiary. Sean forwarded the details to him.

33     Jay said that as Rosanna’s exchange rate was the best rate he had obtained, he decided to do the transaction through her contact. Jay did not know from whom Rosanna had obtained the rate. At 12.23pm, Jay texted Sean that the rate would 1.3585. Jay said that he did a ‘little’ mark-up to the rate that Rosanna gave him in order to earn commission. Sean accepted the rate and told him to collect the money at 3pm at his office at BOS, Raffles Place.

34     At 2.47pm, Sean informed Jay that he would be quoting a rate of 1.367 to Roy. Jay stated that half of the commission was to be paid to Sean as he had referred the deal, and the rest was to be shared between him and Rosanna. He did not know whether Rosanna had also marked up the rate herself to earn a commission.

35     At 2.52pm, Sean re-sent the beneficiary details as requested by Jay. The details of the beneficiary were forwarded to Rosanna by Jay. At 2.53pm, Sean stated that he would require a receipt of the transaction and asked which company was handling the transaction. Jay confirmed with Rosanna that she was using a remittance company. He believed her. He told Sean that the transaction will be safely handled through a remittance company. However, Jay still did not know which remittance company was to be used. He did not inform Sean about Rosanna’s involvement.

36     Sometime after 3pm, Jay collected the S$600,000 from Sean. The money was in six stacks with each stack wrapped with stencil paper and placed in a white paper bag. Jay did not count the money but assumed each stack consisted of $100,000 in $1,000 notes.

37     Jay was instructed by Rosanna to proceed to Sunshine Plaza to meet one Amos. She gave him the mobile number of Amos. Jay did not know who Amos was. He presumed that Amos would bring him to the remittance company.

38     At around 4pm, Jay arrived at Sunshine Plaza. He gave Amos a call. He was asked to wait at a noodle shop at the ground floor. After they met, Amos brought Jay to a lift in the building. Jay assumed they were going to the remittance company. However, he was brought to the carpark instead. Jay asked why they were in the carpark. Amos told him that as they were dealing with each other for the first time, it was not convenient to bring him to the remittance company, and he would do so the next time. Amos told Jay that he could look for him if there were any issues. Jay accepted what Amos said as he thought that Rosanna and Amos did not want him to go direct to the remittance company and cut them out in future. However, he also felt suspicious at the same time as to why it was being done in the car park. Under cross-examination, asked if he believed Amos was an employee of the remittance company, he said that he did not. He said he assumed he knew the boss of the remittance company.

39     In the carpark, Amos brought Jay to meet a man, who was introduced as Jonathan. Amos then left him together with Jonathan. He asked Jonathan why he was receiving the money in the carpark. Jonathan told him that he was acting on the instructions of his boss. Jay then assumed that Jonathan was a representative of the remittance company.

40     Jay testified that he took about $3,000 out from the bag of money. This represented the commission that was to be shared by Rosanna, Sean and himself. He handed the bag with the rest of the money to Jonathan who then sat down and counted the money. Jay took a photograph of Jonathan counting the money (see exh P3) as proof that he passed the money. He also called Rosanna to ask why the money was being counted in the carpark, and she told him that it was not convenient to go up.

41     After Jonathan had counted that the money totalled $596,050, Jay told him that he cannot leave until he (Jay) has received the remittance slip evidencing the money has been transferred to the beneficiary. Jay texted and called Rosanna and told her that the money has been counted. He asked her for the remittance advice in order to be assured that the funds had been transferred to the beneficiary. She said ‘okay’. Jay waited with Jonathan for about 20 to 30 minutes at the carpark before he received the MT103 (exhibit P10) via WhatsApp from Rosanna. He said that Jonathan was texting and speaking to someone on the phone whilst they were waiting. Under cross-examination, Jay said that he no longer has the text message that Rosanna sent him.

42     Jay checked the date, the amount of USD438,917 and the name of the beneficiary in P10 were correct. He said the amount was derived by using the exchange rate of 1.367 which was given by Sean. Jay noticed that the ‘Ordering Customer’ was ‘Arali Investment Manage Limited’ (‘Arali’). Jay did not know whether Arali was a remittance company. He asked Rosanna about it. She told him that it was a Hong Kong remittance company. He said that although he believed Rosanna, he had doubts and he wanted to see the remittance advice to feel assured that the funds were handled properly. He gave the following evidence[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1):

> I actually asked her how come it’s not sent by a Singapore, uh, licenced remittance company and she send from Hong Kong. So she say that, uh, she already told the sending party but then eventually this was being sent out. Uh, and since the money is out already, so I’ve got no choice but to, uh, accept her answer. But I wanted further proof from her that, uh, this is indeed a remittance company, so I asked her for the remittance advice. She then told me that the remittance advice, uh, would come later.

43     Jay allowed Jonathan to leave with the money as he believed that P10 must be genuine. He did not think it was irregular that the company had sent the money to the beneficiary before it had received the money from Jonathan. He took the lift down from the carpark. He gave Amos a call and told him that the transaction was done. He met Amos again at the eatery. Thereafter, they parted ways.

44     It was Jay’s evidence that he forwarded P10 to Sean. However, he was unable to remember if he sent it via WhatsApp or by another application.

45     From Monday (25th) to Wednesday (27th), Jay chased Rosanna for the remittance advice. Rosanna told him that the remittance advice would arrive and the remittance company was just slow. Sean told him that the beneficiary had yet to receive the funds. Jay said he started to worry by the fifth or sixth day. He kept asking Rosanna to check on the delay and asked for the remittance advice. She told him that the bank procedures may have caused the delay.

46     A few days later, Rosanna told him that the funds have been swindled. Jay was shocked and angry. He asked her how that was possible when she had sent him P10. She told him that P10 was fake. He told Rosanna that she must be responsible for the loss because he trusted her. She told him that Amos was the one who had arranged for the person to do the transaction, and she came to know Amos through Yanni, and Yanni in turn knew him through another lady. Rosanna told him that a police report has been lodged and she has asked Amos to track down the person. She later sent him a video of Amos confronting the man in a shop.

47     Jay met up with Sean and Roy and told them they had been cheated. Sean told Jay that he must be responsible for the loss as he had trusted him. On 5 March 2019, Jay messaged Sean, “_Bro, I settle the case properly. The money will be settled by me. Don’t worry about that. Just need to dont say wrong to IO first Knn. kena duah. No wonder ask me sow last night_” By don’t “say wrong to IO first”, Jay said that he meant that he did not want to give the wrong sequence of events to the investigation officer. He said that ‘Knn’ is a vulgarity and ‘kena dua’ meant that he has been played out.

48     He stated that in order to pay the beneficiary, Rosanna, Yanni and himself contributed $300,000. Rosanna paid $170,000 and Yanni paid $30,000 by way of cheques. Jay paid $100,000 in instalments to Sean. Sean paid the balance of $300,000 on condition that he was eventually repaid. Jay said that he is responsible to make the repayment to Sean.

### Evidence of PW4 – Wong Si Si Rosanna (‘Rosanna’)

49     Rosanna is a property agent. She came to know Jay in 2018 through her Buddhist master. She said they are normal friends. She knew that Jay was in the remittance line.

50     On a Thursday in February 2019, which she recollected was the day before the actual transaction on Friday, Jay told her during a phone call that he has a customer who wants to exchange S$600,000 into USD and to deposit the USD into the customer’s BOS account. He requested her to obtain the exchange rate from a licenced company in Singapore. She told him that she will ask.

51     Rosanna had in mind to ask only Yannie Yeung Tze Yan (‘Yannie’) because Yannie had told her towards the end of 2018 that her friend, Elaine, has contacts with remittance businesses. Rosanna came to know Yannie in 2006 or 2007 when she did a property transaction for Yannie’s father. She regards Yannie as ‘close kin’. She stated that Yannie was helping in her family’s jewellery shop. Rosanna does not know Elaine and has not met her.

52     She told Yannie that her friend wanted to exchange S$600,000 to USD and transfer to a bank account with BOS. She asked Yannie to obtain an exchange rate from a licensed company. Yannie told her that she would ask. About 10 to 20 minutes later, Yannie gave her the exchange rate. Rosanna was not able to remember the rate that was quoted. Rosanna knew that Yannie obtained the rate from Elaine but she did not know where Elaine obtained the rate from. She asked Yannie if she had marked-up the rate. Yannie said that she did not. Rosanna told Yannie that she would mark-up the rate to earn a commission. Yannie told her that the commission should be shared between four people – Rosanna, Elaine, Amos and herself.

53     Yannie informed Rosanna that Elaine had approached Amos who knew the remittance company. Rosanna did not know who Amos was at that stage. Rosanna marked up the rate such that the four of them would earn around $1,000 each. Asked if Jay was to earn a commission, she answered that she did not know but he had told her that he would give her a share if he earned a commission.

54     Rosanna quoted the marked-up exchange rate to Jay. He asked her why the exchange rate was so good. As Rosanna was unfamiliar with exchange rates, she replied that she will ask. She asked Yannie. She was told that the money changer has a lot of USD and he is therefore able to give the rate. She informed Jay accordingly. He told her that he would make a comparison with other rates and would speak to his customer.

55     She testified that Jay asked her for the name card of the remittance company or its address. She told him that she will have to ask. She asked Yannie. However, Yannie did not get back to her.

56     On the following day (Friday), Rosanna was informed by Yannie that the money changer is chasing whether the transaction will take place, and if so, it will be done today. She informed Jay accordingly and asked if his client wanted to proceed with the transaction. Jay told her that he would check with his customer. Subsequently, Jay informed her that the transaction will proceed. He asked her where the location of the remittance company is. She told him that she will ask. She was informed by Yannie that the money changer required the beneficiary details so that the money can be transferred immediately after it was counted. She asked Jay for the information and Jay forwarded the details of the beneficiary via WhatsApp. Rosanna then forwarded it to Yannie.

57     Rosanna obtained the contact of Amos from Yannie to speed up the communication. She passed Amos’ contact number to Jay. However, Jay called her to ask about the location to meet the money changer. She called Yannie to obtain the location. She then told Jay that it is at Sunshine Plaza.

58     After Jay reached Sunshine Plaza, she received a call from him. He asked her why he needed to meet someone at the carpark. She asked him whether it was Amos. He told her that it was not Amos. He told her to end the call. Jay then sent to her a photograph of a man who was squatting and counting money in the carpark (see P3). She forwarded the photograph to Yannie and asked her “why this person existed”. She said she was expecting Amos to meet up with Jay and bring him to the remittance company.

59     She testified that Yannie informed her that she has spoken to Amos and he told her that he was with the money changer at a noodles stall. Yannie told her that she heard a man speaking to Amos in the background, and Amos informed her that the man in the carpark was the assistant to the money changer and asked her not to worry as the money changer will transfer the money using his handphone once the money was counted. Rosanna then gave Jay a call and told him what she had been informed. Jay said ‘okay’.

60     Rosanna was aware that after the money was counted, Jay waited with the man at the carpark for the remittance notice to evidence the transfer. Rosanna received the remittance notice (P10) from Yannie and she forwarded it to Jay. She did not read the notice. Jay asked her why the notice was from a company in Hong Kong and which was not a money changer. She asked Yannie what Jay had asked. Yannie informed her that the company has a branch in Hong Kong and that this was a safer approach to transfer the money. Rosanna understood Yannie to have explained that as the remittance notice stated that the payment is for goods, it was akin to a business transaction, as opposed to the money being directly deposited which may result in some issues.

61     Rosanna conveyed what she had been told to Jay. She said that Jay had reservations and asked for proof that the company is registered in Hong Kong and for proof that the money has been transferred out by the company. She asked Yannie again. Yannie told her that the money changer said that the staff have already knocked off from work and that the money has been transferred as evidenced by the receipt P10 and why was there a need for proof and why was the money not being handed over. Further, Yannie told her that the money would be received on Monday. Rosanna conveyed this to Jay.

62     Thereafter, Jay asked Rosanna if the man in the photograph could be trusted to leave with the money. Rosanna told him that since P10 has been forwarded, she believed that the money has been transferred and that it was safe to do so. Jay then agreed to let the man leave. He reminded her to obtain the internet transfer receipt so that he can show it to his customer. She informed Yannie of the request and Yannie told her that it can only be obtained on Monday.

63     On Monday afternoon, she found out from Jay that the money has not been received by the beneficiary. She then asked Yannie who told her that the money was transferred only on Monday and would be received on Tuesday or Wednesday.

64     On Wednesday, she was informed by Jay that the money was still not received in the beneficiary’s account. Jay told her that it should not take so long for a telegraphic transfer. Rosanna then felt something was amiss. She told Yannie to look for Amos as she needed to find out what happened.

65     On Thursday, at about 5 to 6pm, Rosanna met Yannie and Amos at Bedok Hawker Centre. This was her first meeting with Amos. She asked him what happened. Amos told her that the money changer is known as Willie or William. Amos assured her that the money changer would not run away. He showed her some messages on his handphone to prove that he was still in contact with him. Amos also told them that he had called the money changer and arranged to meet on the same day at 8pm. In their presence, Amos then tried to call the money changer but he was unable to call him as the line was cut off. Rosanna told Amos that he is responsible to find the money changer as he is the only one who knows him. Amos agreed that he had to look for him.

66     Rosanna then left for home. Thereafter, she received a call from Yannie who informed her that Amos is unable to contact the moneychanger. Rosanna told Yannie that they must find the residential address to look for him.

67     Either on the same day or the next day, Yannie, Amos and Rosanna went to the money changer’s HDB flat at Simei at around 11pm. They knocked at the door and the accused’s parents opened the door. The accused was not in. Amos informed the accused’s parents that he is Willie’s friend and he has absconded with his money. He asked them for the whereabouts of Willie. The father replied that he was also looking for him and had called him several times but he has not responded. The father showed the calls he had made on his phone.

68     Amos asked Rosanna what he should do and she told him to make a police report. Rosanna told Yannie that Amos must be held responsible for the loss of the money. Amos stated that he is unable to pay as he does not have the money to do so. He said he would instead look for the accused.

69     Rosanna testified that Elaine and Yannie found out that the accused was staying at Sunshine Plaza. She stated that Amos staked out at Sunshine Plaza with one or two friends day and night on Saturday and Sunday.

70     Rosanna testified that she discussed with Yannie during the weekend and told her that she suspected Amos could be involved together with the accused. She told her that she will go to Sunshine Plaza to check if Amos was indeed there keeping a lookout for the accused.

71     On Monday (4th March), at about 3pm, Rosanna received a call from Yannie. She was told that Amos had called Yannie to inform that he spotted the money changer in a Grab car. She was told that Amos had tried to open the door of the car and in the process broke the door handle but the car still drove off. Amos noticed that the Grab car proceeded in the direction of Orchard. He told Yannie that the money changer must be proceeding to play cards at Orchard Central and asked her to go there to look for him.

72     Yannie requested Rosanna to come to Orchard Central immediately. At that stage, Rosanna had already booked a Grab car to proceed to Sunshine Plaza to check if Amos was there. After Yannie’s call, she proceeded to Orchard Central instead. Upon arrival, Rosanna saw Amos, Amos’s friend, Yannie and the money changer who was identified to be the accused. Amos was pushing the accused against the wall. Rosanna shouted at the accused and asked him where is the money. However, the accused denied taking the money.

73     Amos informed her that the accused has removed his watch and handed it together with his bag to the store owner. She asked the store owner to show her the watch. Yannie then took a photograph of it. Rosanna noticed that it was a limited edition watch and estimated its worth to be over $300,000.

74     She stated that Amos showed photograph P3 which was in her phone to the store owner and asked if the man played cards at his store. The store owner said he is a regular customer. He told them that he could not provide his contact number but he will call him to ascertain if he is willing to come down. The store owner called Jonathan and Amos then spoke to Jonathan. He asked Jonathan whether it was convenient for him to come down to clarify matters as he could be considered an accomplice because he counted the missing money. Jonathan agreed to come down to the store.

75     When Jonathan arrived, Amos questioned him. Jonathan explained that the accused had engaged him to count the money in return for $1,000.

76     Rosanna received $1,000 plus as commission. She confirmed that the commission came from Amos but said that she is unable to remember if the money was transferred to her or handed to Elaine and passed to her by Yannie. She was unable to remember the exact amount she received. She refunded the amount she had received to Amos to surrender to the police because she was told by the police that she should not keep the commission as it was a cheating case.

77     Rosanna contributed $170,000 towards the loss by way of two cheques which she issued dated 25 March 2019 for $70,000 and 31 March 2019 for the sum of $100,000 from her personal bank account with Citibank. The name of the payee on both cheques is Xu Wei Wei (see P4). Rosanna stated that she does not know Xu Wei Wei. She was told to make out the cheques to Xu Wei Wei by Jay and he told her that the payee’s money had been used to pay the beneficiary.

78     Under cross-examination, Rosanna said that she knows people in the remittance industry but she did not regard them as good contacts. She said she only regarded Yannie as a contact. Asked if Jay trusted her, she said that he respected her and he knew that their religious master has said she is someone who can be trusted.

79     She agreed that she was not doing Jay a favour and her motivation was to earn commission. She agreed that Jay proceeded with the transaction on her assurance that a licensed remittance company was being used. She stated that she did not know what business the company stated in P10 was doing and said that Yannie informed her that the money changer has said that the company is a subsidiary.

80     Asked if she still had her messages with Jay and Yannie, Rosanna stated that she has changed her Apple iPhone to an Android phone and all her previous messages were not transferred to the new phone. Her previous iPhone was purchased by her ex-husband, and she had thrown it at him in a fit of anger when he asked for the return of items when they were undergoing their divorce in July 2020. She confirmed that she still had the messages when she gave her police statement in March 2019 but said that she was not asked to show the messages and she did not do so on her own accord as she did not know that she needed to do so as it was the first time she had stepped into a police station.

81     She was cross-examined on her police statement which she gave on 5 March 2019 (D2) in which she did not disclose Elaine’s involvement but stated that Yannie told her that she has a friend, Amos, who will be able to help. She explained that she did not do so because only Yannie, Amos and herself were at Orchard Central on the day of the accused’s arrest, and as such she did not want to include too many names to complicate matters. However, when she was interviewed by the prosecutors, she gave a complete and detailed account and disclosed Elaine’s involvement. She was also questioned on her account in her statement that she discussed increasing the exchange rate to earn commission with Amos and Yannie. Rosanna maintained that she did not discuss with Amos as she did not know him at that stage. She said that she gave her statement in English, and as her English is not good, she may not have expressed it accurately.

82     Rosanna disagreed that Amos was the money changer and she had cheated Jay together with Yannie, Elaine, Amos and Jonathan.

### Evidence of PW5 – Yeung Tsz Yan @ Yannie (‘Yannie’)

83     Yannie had a jewellery store at Orchard Central in 2019. She has known Rosanna for more than 10 years and regarded her as a close friend. She said their families also know each other and dine together. She came to know Rosanna through property viewings.

84     She confirmed that she knows Eileen Poh May Peng (‘Eileen’). She came to know Eileen when she participated as a vendor in a flea market in 2017. Eileen was then in the business of selling cosmetic products.

85     One or two days prior to the day of the transaction on 22 February 2019, Rosanna asked her if she knew any money changer who can change a ‘huge’ sum of money. The amount quoted was $3million. Yannie replied that she would ask around. She asked her sisters, fiancée, parents and Eileen.

86     Eileen told her that she should know a money changer who can do it. Eileen later informed her she knows one Amos who knows a moneychanger who can do the transaction. Eileen gave her the mobile number of Amos. Yannie informed Rosanna that she has found someone who knows a money changer who can change a large sum of money.

87     Subsequently, Rosanna informed her that the amount was S$600,000 and it was to be exchanged to USD through a licensed money changer. Rosanna also told her that the money will be handed in cash and the money changer is to transfer the USD to a bank account. Yannie did not know to whom the money belonged to but said that she knew the transaction was not initiated by Rosanna but by ‘someone before her’.

88     Yannie spoke to Amos and shared the details of the transaction with him. He told her that he will check and get back to her. Subsequently, he called her and told her that he has found a few money changers and shared with her the exchange rates which he obtained.

89     Yannie informed Rosanna about the rates which Amos provided. Rosanna commented that one of the rates is below the ‘board rate’ and was very good. Yannie was not able to remember the rate. Rosanna asked how the money changer is able to give such a good rate. Yannie then checked with Amos. He told her that the money changer has an abundance of US dollars. Yannie did not ask Amos any details about the money changer. She said she only told Amos that it must be a legitimate money changer because he will otherwise have to be responsible for any loss. He told her that he understood.

90     Yannie said the rate was accepted by Rosanna’s side. She said the rate was marked-up by either Rosanna or someone before Rosanna so that they can earn a commission. Yannie only knew that the commission would be shared between Rosanna, Amos, Eileen and herself.

91     Thereafter, Yannie informed Amos that the transaction will take place and he asked for the account details of the beneficiary for the money changer to prepare the transfer. Yannie obtained the details from Rosanna and passed to Amos.

92     Sometime in the afternoon (on the day of the transaction), Amos told her that the meeting place to receive the cash is at Sunshine Plaza. He asked Yannie if she wanted to come down. She told him that she is unable to as she has a medical appointment. Yannie passed the contact number of Amos to Rosanna. She said her understanding was that someone from Rosanna’s side was to pass the cash to the money changer to do the bank transfer and issue a receipt.

93     Yannie stated that she received a number of calls from Rosanna and Amos. She learnt that the meet-up was at a car park which made Rosanna’s side very unhappy. She said that Rosanna sent her the photograph P3 via WhatsApp to show that the money was being counted at the car park. Yannie was unaware that the meet-up would take place at a car park. She believed it would be at an office.

94     Yannie called Amos to update him about the concerns. He told her that he was having a meal with the boss of the money changer and the staff was counting the money. She said her understanding of ‘boss of the money changer’ was equivalent to a money changer. Amos told her this was the first occasion they were dealing with the money changer and in future he would bring them to his office. Yannie accepted what she was told. She said[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2): “_Because of---because of my family business dealing with jewellery, then I know there is, um, all these suppliers, they don’t really like strangers to be in their office. So, I thought that this money changer has the same practice_.”

95     She testified that Amos sent a ‘TT receipt’ after the money had been counted. She was unable to remember whether it was sent by WhatsApp or Telegram. When she received the receipt, she did not pay any particular attention to it and believed the transfer had been done and the monies would be received by the next working day, which was Monday. She forwarded the receipt (exh P10) to Rosanna. She found out from Amos and Rosanna that the man from Rosanna’s side did not want to release the cash after receiving the receipt as he was feeling uncomfortable and felt it was unsafe. She said that eventually the money was handed over. In cross-examination, asked if Rosanna had questioned why the transaction was done through a company based in Hong Kong, she said that she did not.

96     On Monday, the money was not received. She assumed the money could be ‘stuck’ as it was a huge sum. However, the money was still not received on Tuesday. She said that Rosanna kept asking her and she kept asking Amos. She said that when the money was not received on Wednesday, Rosanna requested for a meet-up with Amos. Amos said that he was still in contact with the money changer. Yannie and Rosanna suggested to Amos to arrange a meeting with the money changer and the boss.

97     She testified that a meeting was arranged on Thursday night at Block 85 Bedok Hawker Centre. She said that Amos came for the meeting and met her and Rosanna. That was the first time Yannie was meeting Amos. He told them the money changer has gone missing after he told him to attend the meeting. Amos gave them the money changer’s handphone number and name. Yannie recalled the name as William. Yannie and Rosanna also tried to call the number. She was unable to remember if there was any ring tone but said that no one answered. Amos told them that he would try to find the person and requested them to ask around if anybody knew him

98     Yannie stated that they managed to find out where the moneychanger was staying. On Friday or Saturday night, she went with Rosanna and Amos to the flat at Simei. She said a man who looked like he was in his 60s opened the door. She said they asked for ‘Willie’ and he said that no such person is staying there. Yannie said they were sad and lost on hearing that. They sat at the void deck to discuss what to do next. Yannie forwarded P10 to Eileen and also sent her a photo of Willie and asked her if she knew him. Yannie also informed Eileen that the man’s name is Willie. Eileen replied that he is a scammer and suggested that Amos should make a police report. Eileen shared a few social media posts on the person. She said that Amos went to make a police report.

99     She stated that Amos accepted he is responsible for the loss of the money but said that he is unable to reimburse the lost amount. He said he will try his best to find Willie and get back the money. She said they eventually found out that Willie is staying at Sunshine Plaza. Amos then requested his friend to assist him to stake out at Sunshine Plaza to spot Willie.

100    After a few days, Amos spotted Willie in a vehicle. Amos called her and told her that he is in a vehicle tailing after Willie. Amos suspected that Willie was headed to the card game shop at Orchard Gateway and requested her to proceed there as well. Yanni called Rosanna and also told her to proceed to Orchard Gateway.

101    Upon arrival, Yannie saw Amos holding onto the accused. She heard Amos asking the accused for the money. She said the accused was quiet and appeared nervous. Later, Rosanna arrived. Subsequently, the police arrived and brought the accused to a corner.

102    Yannie stated that the store owner showed them the watch that the accused had passed to him. She noticed it had a diamond bezzle and was an expensive watch. She identified the watch to be the one in photograph P15-1.

103    She testified that a man later turned up at the shop and she came to know that he is Jonathan and that he was the person who had counted the money. She said that Jonathan was asked to come down by the store owner at the request of Amos.

104    Yannie viewed her role in the transaction as a messenger. She received $1,000 as commission which she eventually surrendered to the police. She stated that she received it before the meet-up at the Bedok Hawker Centre. Her recollection on how she received the commission was not clear but believed she received cash from Eileen.

105    About one or two weeks after the accused was caught, she met with Jay and Rosanna on how to resolve the issue. She said that Jay insisted that they needed to pay for the loss. She said six persons were responsible for the loss and each of them were supposed to contribute $100,000 towards the loss of $600,000. However, Eileen and Amos did not pay anything. Amos said that he had redeemed himself by capturing the accused. Yannie said she eventually repaid $30,000 only as she did not have enough money. She said that her parents issued a cheque dated 26 March 2019 from their account for the sum of $30,000 to Xu Wei Wei (see exh P6). She did not know who Xu Wei Wei is and was given the name of the payee by Rosanna.

106    Under cross-examination, she stated that this was her first ever remittance transaction. Asked if still had the messages pertaining to the transaction, she said that she had deleted the messages. She said she had a big quarrel with her fiancée (now her husband) about her involvement in the transaction, and he requested her to delete all the messages.

107    She was cross-examined on her statement which she gave to the police on 5 March 2019 (see D3). With respect to \[3\] where it was recorded, ‘_I remember discussing the difference with Amos to increase rates by a little bit so as to earned some money for ourselves_.”, she explained that what she meant was that she knew of the difference in rate that was adjusted by Rosanna’s side and she shared with Amos how much they could earn as commission.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) As regards \[5\], where she stated, “_Amos informed me that based on his information from his partner, Rosanna client will receive the money a few days later_.”, she said that she used ‘partner’ to refer to the person that Amos was always liaising with. She disagreed that ‘partner’ referred to Jonathan.

108    She disagreed that Amos was the money changer and together with Rosanna, Eileen, Jonathan, she had cheated Jay.

### Evidence of PW6 – Chua Hui Ling @ Michelle (‘Michelle’)

109    Michelle works part time at CHRONO95 which is a luxury watch boutique at Far East Shopping Centre. She was shown invoice P7 dated 22 February 2019 issued by CHRONO95. She said the invoice was issued and signed by her colleague, Angela Foo.

110    She stated the Chinese character beside ‘Client’ is ‘Wang’ and the mobile number ‘XXX’ was provided by the client. The description of the watch sold was ‘Patek Philippe Nautilus’ and its cost was $345,000. The model number and serial number were also included in the invoice. She said the customer paid in cash and collected it the same day. She was shown the two photographs (P15-1 and P15-2) of the watch which was seized by the police and she confirmed the model and serial number were identical to the watch in the invoice.

111    She confirmed there were messages received from the client prior to the sale but said they were handled by Angela Foo.

### Evidence of PW7 – Eileen Poh May Peng (‘Eileen’)

112    Eileen has been running a beauty salon since 2016. She had a cosmetics shop before that. She testified that she used to participate in flea markets, which were organised by Yannie, to sell cosmetics. She then came to know Yannie.

113    In late February 2019, Yannie contacted her and told her that someone who had won a few hundred thousand dollars at the casino wanted to do a currency exchange and transfer the exchanged amount to a bank account. She recalled that she was told the money belonged to a Japanese. Yannie asked her if she has any contacts who could perform the transaction. Eileen replied that she will try to ask around. Subsequently, Yannie informed her the amount to be exchanged is S$600,000.

114    Eileen decided to ask her regular client, Amos, whom she regards as a friend. She said he had come for eye brow touch-up at her salon not too long ago. She did not know what Amos did for a living. She informed him what Yannie had told her and asked him if he has any contacts. Amos told her that he will ask around. Shortly thereafter he said he had a contact. She then told Yannie that Amos has a good contact and gave her Amos’ number and also gave Amos Yannie’s contact. Eileen said she was preparing for a trip to Taiwan, and left it to Yannie and Amos to contact each other.

115    On 28 February 2019 or on 1 March 2019, she left for Taiwan. On the following day at night, Amos called her. He told her that she would be given commission for the referral. Eileen did not know until then that she would receive commission. She said that she in fact did not even know that the transaction would go through. She said Amos was very panicky during the call and told her that the person ran off with the money. She asked who the person is. He gave her the name ‘Willie Ong’. She told Amos that she knows a person by that name and the money would have been gone. Amos requested her to try and locate Willie Ong. She agreed to check if she can find him.

116    Eileen identified the accused to be Willie Ong. She stated that she knew the accused as ‘Willie’ and had met him in a club. She said they were ‘drinking friends’ and used to ‘drink together quite a bit’ between 2014 and 2015.

117    She called a friend, Jacob, who used to work in the same bank as the accused to ask if he knows the address of the accused. Jacob told her to try Sunshine Plaza. Eileen then searched the social media for information on the accused. She came across postings by the accused’s wife on rental of units at Sunshine Plaza. She told Amos to try to look for the accused at Sunshine Plaza. On the following day, Amos told her that he will go to Sunshine Plaza.

118    Asked if she had seen P10, she said she had asked Yannie if they had received the ‘TT slip’ for the transfer, and P10 was forwarded to her by either Yannie or Amos via WhatsApp. She did an Internet search on telegraphic transfers. She concluded that P10 was fake.

119    Subsequently, Amos informed her that he spotted the accused getting into a cab. Amos guessed that the cab was proceeding to Orchard Gateway to play cards.

120    It was her evidence that she only knew Yannie, Amos and the accused. She said she had heard Yannie mention ‘Ros’ and understood that the transaction was referred to Yannie by ‘Ros’. However, she did not know who ‘Ros’ was.

121    Under cross-examination, she disagreed that the accused has not met her before. Asked if she had her WhatsApp messages with Yannie and Amos, she explained that she deletes her messages regularly because she receives a lot of messages from clients.

122    She disagreed that Amos was the money changer and that she had cheated Jay together with Rosanna, Yannie, Amos and Jonathan.

123    With respect to the commission, her recollection was that she received about $1,000 by way of funds transfer. She surrendered the sum to the police.

### Evidence of PW8 – Amos Lee Zhi Hao (‘Amos’)

124    Amos was working for an oil and gas trading company in 2019. He testified that he knows Eileen because he goes to her salon for eyebrow embroidery.

125    In February 2019, Eileen asked him if he knew any remittance service provider. She told him that a friend by the name of Yannie has informed her of an opportunity to earn commission. He told Eileen that he will enquire from his friends.

126    In the same month, he went fishing with his friends. He asked them if they know anyone who provides remittance services. Michael replied that he may know someone. Subsequently, he was given a contact number by Michael and was told the person was providing remittance services. The contact number was that of the accused.

127    Amos called the contact number and introduced himself. The accused gave his name as Xiao Wang and Willie or William. The accused claimed he was providing remittance services. Amos said he made one or two queries on exchange rates but he did not do any transaction with the accused. The accused told him that his boss is unhappy as he has made queries which have not resulted in any transaction. Subsequently, the accused proposed a physical meeting.

128    On 14 February 2019, Amos met the accused at Beauty World car park. Michael was also present. The venue was suggested by the accused. At the meeting, the accused claimed his boss has a casino in Cambodia and in other countries and was also doing remittance service. The accused claimed the remittance company has a big sum of money in its bank account. However, the accused did not mention the name of the remittance company.

129    Amos testified that he communicated with the accused via WhatsApp and Telegram. He produced the WhatsApp messages to the police in the course of investigations (see P8). He stated that it was the accused who suggested the use of Telegram. Amos explained that he was unable to retrieve the Telegram messages due to its self-destruct function.

130    He was referred to the message ‘_Ignore the MC. See TG_. _Don’t bother dealing with aNy mc’_ sent by the accused on 15 February 2019 at 12:22. Amos said ‘MC’ referred to money changer. He understood the accused was telling him not to ask any other remittance service provider/ money changer. In cross-examination, Amos disagreed that the accused did not inform him he was providing remittance services and instead said he was working for a brokerage firm, Wilson Corporate Services. Amos was unable to remember if the accused told him he was a banker previously but agreed that he could have. He disagreed that he told the accused that he has clients in Japan and Malaysia who required currency exchange. He disagreed the accused told him that he may have a person who could do the remittance for him.

131    Amos testified that the accused called him many times between 15 to 19 February 2019 to ask him if there were any remittance service transactions. Amos informed him that there is none. On 19 February 2019 at 10.12am, the accused messaged “_Cash to cash \[good\] also_”. Later, between 9.01pm and 9.02pm, the accused messaged: “_K bro, if got lobang share a bit la. If support the card one I can at least earn abit money la. Or got wire biz also good la. No support nth to earn. Dam sian_”. Amos said that ‘cash to cash’ referred to money changing business, ‘support the card one’ to trading cards, and ‘wire biz’ to remittance service. He said the accused was lamenting that he has not been able to earn anything from these activities and was asking him to share earning opportunities. On the next day (20 February 2019) at 11.54am, the accused messaged ‘_Sian lei got \[nothing\] so far ah_’. Amos replied, “_where got everyday got thing de_.”

132    Amos informed Eileen that he has found someone who can do the transaction. Eileen then gave him the contact number of Yannie. He knew Yannie was obtaining instructions from someone but he did not know from whom.

133    On 21 February 2019, as a result of the query by Yannie, Amos called the accused to ask about the exchange rate from SGD to USD and enquired if the exchanged amount could be received via wire remittance on the same day. At 1.48pm, on the same day, the accused messaged the exchange rate from SGD to USD as ‘1.348’ and said ‘_Same day impossible_. _Cross country’_. As Yannie had informed Amos that the remittance must be to a BOS account, Amos asked, ‘_If \[from\] sg to \[Bank of Singapore\]? In usd can do same day right._’ The accused answered ‘_Wire from HK impossible same day. Especially the timing now. Not possible. And amount \[you\] mention impossible_.’ Amos replied that he would inform that his (accused) side is requesting to do the transaction tomorrow. Amos then enquired how much the exchange rate was ‘outside’. The accused replied, ‘_Can give till 1.357 also \[people\] will do_.’ Amos replied, ‘_Now is 1.35’_. Amos was unable to remember where he had obtained ‘1.35’ from but said he had also asked other remittance companies. The accused replied ‘_Bro some rates is special one. They call it interbank rate. Between then what end users getting. Else how MC survive. Why \[people\] change with MC and not bank. Bank set the standard rate. Then got preferential rate._” Amos replied, “_I thinking how to tell them so I can I get better \[commission\]’_. The accused replied, ‘_U tell them 1.37 lor_’.

134    Amos informed Yannie of the rate of ‘1.348’ which the accused gave. He said the accused asked him to compare the rate with the XE App. According to Amos, he did not do any mark-up and left it to Yannie and the person she was dealing with. After Yannie had informed him of the preferred rate, he messaged the accused ‘_They \[want\] 1.35’_ and asked the accused if it was acceptable. The accused replied, ‘_Can do_.’ Amos then replied, ‘_If ok they bring to \[office\]._’ Amos said he was referring to the accused’s office.

135    He went on to state that he asked the accused about his company’s background. The accused sent him a redacted bank statement showing the company has USD23 million deposited in its bank account (see P9). Amos noted the statement showed the company was located at Level 12, Tower One, Marina Bay Financial Centre. Amos was unable to remember if P9 was sent to him via WhatsApp or Telegram. He believed the accused was a legitimate remittance service provider. He said that P9 was saved in his handphone. He was shown the unredacted version of P9 (P27) which is addressed to ‘Chen Zhi’. Amos said he had not seen P27 and he does not know Chen Zhi.

136    On 21 February 2019, at 3.15pm, the accused messaged, _‘\[You\] see the time now then \[you\] decide._’ At 3.26pm, Amos replied, ‘_Bro I \[just\] called them. I told them if by 4.30pm \[never\] come \[then\] today closed._’ At 4.14pm, Amos messaged the accused _‘\[Your\] side dont confirm anything to \[your\] boss. I will get a confirmation \[from\] my side den I will tell \[you\]. I have told them. I will \[want\] to meet them up den go with them.’_ Amos explained that he wanted to meet up with the client on Yannie’s side to go to the accused’s office for the remittance transaction. The accused replied, ‘_Yea ok_’.

137    On 22 February 2019 at 10.18am, the accused messaged about the remittance transaction and said, ‘_Remember update if today \[got\] action._’ Amos replied that he would update if he received a call. At 10.39am, the accused messaged ‘_USD spike’_. At 12.18pm, Amos asked what the rate was for wiring the S$600,000. The accused replied by asking Amos to use the Telegram chat. Amos was unable to recall the details of the discussion on Telegram but was able to remember that the currency exchange rate was agreed upon.

138    At 2.30pm, Amos informed the accused that the meet-up would be at 3.30pm and asked for the location. The accused told him to meet at Sunshine Plaza. Amos then informed Yannie of the location. Amos was asked to meet the client, Jay, at the taxi stand by Yannie.

139    At 3.27pm, Amos sent to the accused the details of the beneficiary (name and bank account details) and the amount to be transferred in USD which he had obtained from Yannie. He asked the accused to confirm that the amount exchanged will be USD 438,917.

140    At about 3.30pm, Amos arrived at Sunshine Plaza. He met the accused at a noodle shop at the first level. The accused told him to bring the client up by the ramp to the car park where his worker would be waiting at the righthand side. Thereafter, Amos went to wait for Jay. Whilst waiting for Jay, he received two missed calls from the accused at 3.50pm and 3.52pm.

141    After meeting Jay at the taxi stand, he brought him to the car park to meet the accused’s worker. After confirming the person was the accused’s worker, Amos left Jay with the person. He went to meet the accused again. In cross-examination, Amos denied that he informed Jay that it was inconvenient to bring him to the office as it was their first meeting and he would do so on the next occasion.

142    Amos came down and met the accused again at the noodle shop and they both then went to outside the 7-Eleven as the accused wanted to smoke whilst waiting for his worker to count the money. Whilst waiting, Amos received a call from Yannie. She informed him that Jay was suspicious as to why the transaction was being done in the car park. Amos asked the accused. The accused told him that there is no need to go to the office as the amount is small and it can be counted at the car park.

143    After 20 to 30 minutes, the worker called the accused to inform him of the amount that has been counted. After the amount was verified to be correct, the accused was asked to provide the remittance slip. Amos testified that the accused forwarded the MT103 receipt to him via Telegram. He confirmed that P10 was the receipt which was forwarded to him. Amos verified the details on P10 were correct and he forwarded it to Yannie. He said the accused informed him that the money would be received in the bank account by Monday. In cross-examination, Amos denied that he sent P10 to the accused via Telegram.

144    Amos went up to the car park to meet Jay after the receipt P10 had been accepted. He did not know where the accused went to. He did not speak to the accused’s worker. Jay and him walked down the carpark ramp to the first level. Jay asked him why the transaction was done in the car park. He told him the accused had said it was because the amount is not huge and therefore it could be done in the carpark.

145    In cross-examination, Amos disagreed that after he went up to the carpark again, he was there for about 20 minutes with Jay and Jonathan. He disagreed that he met the accused again after Jay left and had coffee with him. He disagreed that after the accused left to buy 4D lottery, he went up to the carpark to meet Jonathan again. He disagreed that he instructed Jonathan to pass the bag of money to the accused and to ask the accused to take $1,000 from it as referral fee and to return the rest of the money back to him (Amos).

146    At about 5.01pm, Amos received a missed call from the accused. Amos had returned to his workplace by then. At 5.10pm, he messaged ‘Later meet then say’. Amos explained that this message was in connection with the commission that the accused was to pass to him. Amos testified that the total amount of commission earned was $4,000 plus which was to be shared equally between Yannie, Eileen, himself and Yannie’s partner. Amos testified that he surrendered the commission to the police.

147    At 7.32pm, he enquired where to meet. He testified that the accused suggested to meet at the Toast Box of Eastpoint Mall. Sometime after 8pm or around 9pm, he met the accused and received the commission in cash of $4,000 plus. In cross-examination, Amos disagreed that he did not meet the accused at Eastpoint Mall. He testified that he passed $3,000 plus to Eileen. He was unable to remember when he passed the cash to Eileen but said that it was a few days later.

148    On 23 February 2019 at 7.45pm, Amos sent a message ‘_Bro, update me later go where meet u \[take\]_’. Amos stated that the accused had told him that his boss wanted to give him $2,000 plus out of goodwill so he can make another referral. The accused did not tell Amos who his boss is. He met the accused at Eastpoint Mall again where he received the $2,000 plus. In cross-examination, Amos disagreed that the accused passed him the bag of cash at this meeting.

149    On 25 February 2019, Yannie informed him that the money has not been transferred to the client’s bank account. Amos then called the accused. The accused told him that the amount has been deducted from the company’s account. The accused told him the money should be received in a few days. Amos informed Yannie accordingly.

150    On 27 February 2019, Yannie again informed him that the amount has not been received. She asked him to check with the accused. At 9.16am, Amos messaged the accused ‘_Haha. And they say the BOS usd still haven’t received. Bro can help me check. Thank you_.’ Amos did not receive a reply from the accused. At 3.31pm, Amos sent another message, ‘_Bro. Able to show the bank statement date with the deduction? Or let me know status. Thx. My client keep chasing. Not small amt._’ The accused did not reply. At 4.17pm, Amos sent another message ‘_Can send tracker if not received by today \[already\]_’ At 5.49pm, he sent another message ‘_Just send a photo showing deduction will be good_. _My other 2 TT from HK has reached today_.’ Amos explained that the reference to ‘other 2 TT’ was a bluff to try and get a response from the accused. However, the accused did not reply to the messages.

151    On 28 February 2019, Yannie informed Amos that the amount has still not been received. Amos said everyone was panicking and Yannie suggested that they meet to discuss the matter. At 6.30pm, he sent a message to the accused but he did not reply. On the same day, he met Yannie and Rosanna in the evening at Bedok North Hawker Centre. This was his first meeting with the two ladies. He said they questioned him on the whereabouts of the money. He said he was panicky and he showed them his WhatsApp messages with the accused to allay any suspicions that he was collaborating with the accused. He tried to call the accused but his voice call was blocked off. He told Yannie and Rosanna that he would try to find the accused and asked them to give him a few days

152    At 10.17pm, he messaged the accused ‘_Bro call be bk. Thk u. I at Bedok wait for u. Or u wan me to go find him._’ Amos explained that ‘go find him’ referred to the accused’s boss because the accused told him that the money was with his boss. The accused did not reply. At 10.24pm to 10.33pm, he messaged ‘_Bro jus update me what is the status now can? OR is there anyway we can meet the other party? Bro, update me asap ba._’

153    On 2 March 2019, sometime at night, he met Yannie and Rosanna again to go to the accused’s residence at Simei. Amos did not know how Yannie and Rosanna were able to find the accused’s residential address. He said the accused’s parents were in and the father informed them that the accused has not returned home.

154    Thereafter, Amos went to the Changi Neighbourhood Police Centre at Simei Street 2 to lodge a police report at 3.14am on 3 March 2019 (see P11). Amos said that he was very flustered when he made the report and give a summarised account which had some inaccuracies. With respect to \[1\] of P13, he stated that the reference to “my client” was inaccurate. As regards why he stated the sum of $4,725 commission was passed to him on 23 February 2019, Amos explained that he forgot that he had in fact received the money on 22 February 2019.

155    Subsequently, Eileen told him that the accused is staying at Sunshine Plaza condominium. Amos then did a stake out there from about 9am until 1 to 2am. He was assisted by his friend, Mario.

156    On 4 March 2019, Mario spotted the accused. He then called Amos who was keeping watch at Sunshine Plaza Shopping Centre. Amos rushed over. He saw the accused was in a Grab car. Amos went in front of the car in an attempt to stop it but it drove off. In the process of trying to stop the car, Amos pulled at the handle of the rear door and dislodged the handle. Amos suspected that the accused was proceeding to a gaming shop at Orchard. He said he had found out the location of the gaming shop from an Internet search.

157    Amos and Mario then took a Grab car to the location. Amos spotted the accused at the gaming shop. He went over and grabbed the accused and his bag. Amos noticed the accused asking the store owner to remove his watch which he was wearing. He also heard the accused telling the store owner to call the security. Amos questioned the accused on why he had blocked him on WhatsApp but the accused did not give a response. He asked the accused where the money was and the accused claimed that he did not take it.

158    Amos told the store owner about the matter and told him that another man had counted the money. He described the person who had counted the money. Amos did not know the name of the person then. He was unable to remember if he showed photograph P3. The shop owner searched his Facebook account and showed him a picture. Amos confirmed that was the person.

159    The store owner then called Jonathan. Amos spoke to Jonathan and he confirmed he was the one who counted the money. He asked Jonathan where the money was. Jonathan told him that he handed the money to the accused. Amos then asked Jonathan to come to the store. Jonathan agreed and came down.

160    Amos also called Yannie and informed her that he has detained the accused. Yannie and Rosanna then came to the store. When Jonathan came to the store, he informed Amos that the accused had only asked him to count the money and paid him for doing so.

161    Amos testified that he did not have any communication with Jay, Rosanna and Jonathan. He said that he did not provide his messages with Yannie and Eileen to the investigation officer because he was not requested to do so. He said that he is unable to do so now because he has changed his handphone.

162    In cross-examination, Amos disagreed that he had conspired to cheat Jay together with Yannie, Rosanna, Eileen and Jonathan.

### Evidence of PW9 – Chue Kok Fai, Jerry (‘Jerry’)

163    Jerry is a director of Gaming Sanctuary Private Limited (‘Gaming Sanctuary’) since 2017. It has a store at level 4 of Orchard Gateway which trades in card games.

164    He testified that the accused came often to the store. He knew the accused as William. Based on the store’s video footage, he confirmed the accused was at the store playing trading card games with him on 4 March 2019 at about 2.15pm when two men entered and grabbed the accused. Jerry was shocked and immediately called the building’s management and thereafter the police.

165    He recollected that one of the men asked the accused, ‘You still trying to run?’ and ‘Where is the money?’. He testified that the accused asked him to keep the watch that he was wearing. Jerry assisted to remove the watch from the accused’s wrist and kept it in the counter. He confirmed the watch photographed in P15-1 was the watch that the accused was wearing. He said the two men requested to look at the watch and he showed it to them. Jerry finally passed the watch to the police.

166    Jerry stated that one of the men showed him a picture which was saved in a handphone. He identified the photograph which was shown to him as similar to P3. He was told that the man in the photograph had assisted the accused to collect the money. He was not given the name of the person. Jerry recognised the person in P3 to be Jonathan. He told them he was his customer. He said that he had seen Jonathan and the accused talking in the store and he believed they knew each other. Jerry testified that the accused told him not to ask Jonathan to come down to the store.

167    Jerry went ahead to call Jonathan. He told him about the allegation of taking the money. He said Jonathan denied taking the money. He told him to come down to explain, and Jonathan agreed to do so. Jerry was unable to remember if he passed the phone to one of the two men to speak to Jonathan.

168    Under cross-examination, Jerry disagreed that the accused called the police. Asked if the police came before he called Jonathan, he replied that he believed so. He agreed that the police separated the two men and the accused. He said the accused was just outside his shop at the entrance but he was not stationary. He said he was walking around and trying to look at what was happening in the store.

169    In response to my questions, he said that he is able to recollect that he went outside of his counter area to clarify with the accused if Jonathan was involved. He said the accused told him in Mandarin not to call Jonathan to come down.

### Evidence of PW10 – Lim Yi Ren, Jonathan (‘Jonathan’)

170    Jonathan was an account manager for a software company, Oracle, at the material time. He first met the accused in December 2018 at Gaming Sanctuary located at Orchard Gateway. He knew him as William Tan.

171    He testified that the accused was out of a job then and was doing money-changing business. The accused asked him if he had any clients to refer to him, and if so, he would give him a commission. Jonathan kept in touch with the accused after the first meeting via WhatsApp. He said they eventually switched to communicating via Telegram at the request of accused because of its ‘secret chat’ feature as the accused said he has problems at home. Jonathan explained that the feature allows messages to disappear after a set time. Jonathan produced his WhatsApp messages with the accused to the police (see P12) but he was unable to produce the Telegram messages due to its self-destruct feature.

172    On 27 December 2018, the accused messaged ‘Update me lol.’ Jonathan said that this referred to the accused asking him if he knew of anyone who needed to exchange currency. He replied that the ‘_The guy say he settle himself.’_, which meant that no one required the accused’s services. He was next referred to a message at 10.50.36 by the accused, _‘\[You\] go ask your customers see got lobang Not._’ Jonathan testified that the accused was again asking him to refer people who may require the accused’s business. Jonathan messaged that it will be hard as he was serving customers from Singapore but said he will ask. The accused replied ‘Try la’. Under cross-examination, Jonathan disagreed that he was sharing his remittance transactions.

173    On 28 December 2018 at 11:11:45am, the accused again messaged Jonathan to refer customers to him. He said, ‘_\[You\] mention \[you\] got a few customer right. Lol. Try asking the other lei._’. Jonathan replied, ‘_Not really. The others not so close. And the amount not so huge._’ The accused continued, ‘_Try la. Ask is free_. _Start small lol_.’ Jonathan replied ‘_Ten twenty k at most’_, to which the accused said, ‘_That one cannot la_. _lol \[You\] ask them then \[you\] tell them minimum vol. lol. See what they say_.’ At 11.49.10am, the accused messaged, “_Meanwhile check with customers and update me when we meet_.’

174    On 7 January 2019 at 8.23.21pm, the accused messaged to ask Jonathan if he could introduced him to his recruitment agency. Jonathan replied that the positions are sales related and IT sales require minimum experience. The accused replied that he needed to find something to do.

175    On 14 January 2019, the accused messaged Jonathan to ask his Human Resource department (‘HR’) for vacancies in Oracle. Jonathan replied that his HR would require his curriculum vitae (‘CV’). He also asked the accused to check Oracle’s website on which role will suit him and if there were any openings. On 16 January 2019 at 10.53.19am, the accused sent his CV to Jonathan who then forwarded it to his HR department and to the recruitment agency.

176    On 17 January 2019 at 2.10pm, the accused messaged Jonathan to ask his HR. Jonathan advised the accused to look elsewhere. On 21 January 2019, Jonathan forwarded the HR’s reply that the accused was not suitable for any roles.

177    On 29 January 2019 at 11.18.49am, the accused again asked Jonathan if there are any vacancies within his Oracle team. Jonathan replied that there were no vacancies. At 4.41.23pm, the accused again asked Jonathan if there were any job openings.

178    On 30 January 2019 at 7.55.56am, the accused messaged Jonathan requesting him to ask his HR again. He wrote “_Any sales role. I need a job man. Going nutz_.”

179    On 9 February 2019 at 1.43.48pm, the accused asked if there was any news from HR. Jonathan replied that there was no news and no chance. On 19 February 2019, Jonathan informed the accused that his HR said she was still finding but it was hard.

180    On 22 February 2019, the accused asked Jonathan for help to count money. At 12.33.23pm, Jonathan asked the accused ‘Most likely what time?’ The accused replied that he would let him know soon. Jonathan stated that 3 plus or 4 plus will be better for him. The accused replied he would update by 2pm. At 12.53.19pm, Jonathan messaged he has Telegram. At 12.54.19pm, he messaged that the reception was bad. Johnathan said he was at Sanctuary Gaming when his handphone reception was bad. At 2.41.44pm, there was a missed call from the accused. He returned the call and the accused asked him to meet him at Sunshine Plaza to count money. Jonathan said that he did not know the background to the request but he agreed to help.

181    Jonathan met the accused at the drop-off point at Sunshine Plaza. Based on the CCTV footage, Jonathan said the accused and him were walking toward the outside of 7-Eleven at about 3.26pm because the accused wanted to smoke. Whilst smoking, the accused informed him that he needed his help to count close to S$600,000. The accused did not tell him at that stage where the counting would be done. The accused told him he was waiting for his contact to come to ‘settle some stuff’ first. After about five minutes, the accused said he was meeting his contact inside the building. He told Jonathan to wait outside the 7-Eleven. However, Jonathan said he was curious and went inside the building. He saw the accused sitting with a man outside an eatery.

182    After 10 to 15 minutes, the accused came over and told him that the money will be counted in the carpark of Sunshine Plaza. The accused claimed that he was unable to use the office on that day. Jonathan was unable to recall the reason that the accused gave. Based on the video footage, at about 3.43pm, the accused and him walked up two ramps of the car park. The accused brought him to a far corner of the car park near to a pillar. The accused told him to wait there for someone to arrive with the cash which is to be counted. The accused added that he needed someone neutral to count the money. The accused told him to bring the cash to PoMo Mall after he had counted it. The accused said that he was going to meet his contact again to ensure that the contact would not arrange for someone else to come and take the money. Thereafter, the accused left the car park.

183    About 10 minutes later (based on the footage at about 3.53pm), Jonathan saw two men approaching him. He said the man in the black T-shirt and white T-shirt seen in the footage were the ones who approached him. He did not know the two men. He had first seen the man in the black T-shirt with the accused outside the eatery when the accused first told him that he was meeting his contact. He said the man in black T-shirt gestured to the man in white T-shirt to approach him from a distance. The man in white T-shirt approached him and the man in black T-shirt then left.

184    He said the money in white T-shirt asked him if he was the one counting the cash. Jonathan said there was no introduction. After he confirmed he was counting the cash, the man handed him the paper bag which he was carrying. Jonathan saw stacks of cash in it. Jonathan said the stacks of cash consisted of $100,000 each. Whilst he was counting, the man in white T-shirt asked why was the money being counted in a car park and not in an office. Jonathan replied, ‘I’m just the worker of my boss’. Jonathan said he was referring to the accused as the ‘boss’ and himself as the worker because the accused had told him to say that and to direct all questions to him.

185    After he had counted the money, which Jonathan estimated took about 10 minutes, he messaged the accused via Telegram to inform him that he has counted the money. The man in the white T-shirt asked Jonathan for a receipt. Jonathan then messaged the accused to inform him of the request. The accused told him to wait at the location. After 5 to 10 minutes, he noticed that the man in white T-shirt had received a message. Jonathan said the man was visibly unhappy at the company which was stated in the receipt. He said the man asked him but he told him that he does not know anything and to check with his boss. He said the man then started to call and message. Jonathan then sent a message via Telegram to the accused to inform that the man was unhappy with the receipt and asked him what he should do. The accused told him that he would settle with his contact and asked him to wait.

186    After about five minutes, the accused told him that everything was settled and asked to meet him at Singapore Pools which was across the road from Sunshine Plaza. Jonathan said that when he started to leave, the man in white T-shirt tried to stop him and said that everything is not settled as the company on the receipt is totally different. Jonathan called the accused again. The accused told him that his contact would go up to the carpark to assure the man. Jonathan said that as the accused was saying this, he saw the man in the black T-shirt walking up the ramp towards the other man.

187    Based on the footage, Jonathan confirmed that he walked down the ramp at about 4.53pm. He put the bag of cash in his backpack. He spoke to the accused on the handphone as he was walking down. The accused asked him to meet at Singapore Pools. He told the accused that he was leaving the car park with the cash and was on his way. He said the accused asked him the amount and whether there were any questions. He told him that the man in white T-shirt complained why the money was being counted in the car park instead of in an office. He said the accused just waived it off.

188    Jonathan said that he met the accused after the traffic light and they went to an alley behind Singapore Pools. He then passed the bag of cash to the accused. The accused took a $1,000 note and handed it to Jonathan. He told him that it was payment for his help in counting the cash. Jonathan said the accused had mentioned earlier that he would give him a small commission but he did not specify the exact sum. From the alley, the accused and Jonathan cut through NAFA campus. The accused asked him to buy something to get a plastic bag as he (accused) wanted to place the bag of cash into the plastic bag to avoid the bag being recognised. Jonathan went into a provision shop to buy a bottle of water and obtained a plastic bag. The accused remained outside the shop. From the CCTV footage, at 4.53pm, the accused is seen carrying a white bag in which the cash was placed and walking outside the provision shop.

189    After the purchase, Jonathan exited the shop with the plastic bag and handed it to the accused. Jonathan placed the water bottle in his backpack. The accused then placed the bag of cash into the red plastic bag. Thereafter, the accused and Jonathan parted ways.

190    On 4 March 2019, Jonathan received a call from Jerry which he was unable to answer as he was in a meeting. Thereafter, he received messages from Jerry that there are people in his store with the accused and he mentioned of a fraud and scam. He called Jerry and spoke to him briefly. Jerry then passed the phone to a man. The man told him that he had apprehended the accused and the accused had pinned the entire blame on him (Jonathan). The man asked him to come to the store to clear his name. He said that Jerry informed him that the accused had asked him (Jerry) to inform him (Jonathan) not to come to the store. Jonathan said that he decided to rush to the store.

191    When he arrived, he saw the accused was handcuffed. He also saw the man wearing the black T-shirt whom he had seen at Sunshine Plaza. He said the man introduced himself as Amos. Amos told him that the transaction did not go through and he had been looking for the accused. He said that Amos told him that the accused is alleging the cash is with him (Jonathan). He told Amos that the cash was not with him and he only received $1,000 for counting the cash. He surrendered the $1,000 to the police in the course of investigations.

192    Under cross-examination, Jonathan agreed that he has played and traded Magic: The Gathering trading cards with the accused. He agreed that he met him about once a week to play the card game and they became friends as a result. He disagreed that he told the accused that he was conducting remittance business.

193    Jonathan disagreed that the messages on 28 December 2018 between 11:11:45 to 11:12:06am related to the accused trying to introduce customers for his remittance business. He also disagreed that the messages between 11:12:15 to 11:12:58am related to the accused telling him that his clients could only start with a small amount of money and that he responded by saying that the minimum sum should be $10,000 to $20,000.

194    Jonathan was next referred to his message on 14 January 2019 at 11.26:26pm ‘_You take money from the Indon and the cards from \[your friend\] yet, boh._” It was asserted that this message related to an Indonesian client that the accused introduced for the remittance business. Jonathan explained that the Indonesian was a Magic card player and there was an exchange of cards between the accused, the Indonesian and himself. As regards the message at 1:44:16pm on 15 Jan 2019, “_Indon guy got reply anot_”, Jonathan disagreed that he was asking if the Indonesian was serious about proceeding with the remittance transaction. He explained that he was enquiring about a trade in relation to the magic cards. As regards the message on 16 January 2019 at 11:12:35, “_I need to recoup the funds to that Indon guy first_”, it was put that it related to a penalty that Jonathan had to bear because the remittance transaction did not go through. Jonathan explained that he had spent between $4,000 to $5,000 on purchasing cards online and the accused had asked him to do a trade with the Indonesian but it did not take place. Jonathan was next referred to his message on 18 January 2018 at 10:46:53am where he said, “_If the Indon guy pass us the money then I’m ok. But at this stage a lot of investment but no returns_.” and it was put that it related to the Indonesian wanting to remit S$500,000, to which Jonathan disagreed. Next, it was put to him that the message on 29 January 2019 at 11:41:24pm, “_Indon guy got say anythin_g_?_” referred to him asking the accused if there were any updates on the Indonesian client who wanted to do a remittance transaction of about S$500,000, to which Jonathan disagreed. He said it referred to the magic card trade that was supposed to be done.

195    It was put that the accused did not ask him to assist to count the money, to which Jonathan disagreed. He disagreed that after he left the carpark with the bag of money, he called the accused to ask where he was. He disagreed that the accused told him that he was buying lottery tickets at Singapore Pools. He disagreed that he told the accused that there was a change in plans by Amos, and he asked the accused to pass the bag of money to Amos. He disagreed that he told the accused that his referral fee was $1,000 and Amos’ share was also in the bag. He disagreed that the accused told him that he still owed him about $1,000 and declined the referral fee. He disagreed that he (Jonathan) then took $1,000 from the bag and kept it. He disagreed that he decided to give the plastic bag to the accused so that people will not be able to see the money in the paper bag. He disagreed that the accused asked him on WeChat about the sudden change in plans, and he said his boss will handle everything.

### Evidence of PW11 – Foo Min Lee, Angela (‘Angela’)

196    Angela has been working at Chrono95 since mid-2016 as a boutique manager. She was shown invoice P7 dated 22 February 2019 for the sale of a Patek Philippe Nautilus watch model 5980/10R-010 for $345,000. She stated the details of the invoice were filled in by her except for the name of the client and mobile number. She said the customer wrote his name in Chinese and the mobile number XXX. She stated that the Chinese character for the name is ‘Wang’.

197    She was shown photographs P15-1 and P15-2 and she confirmed the serial number 7187828 matched that of the watch sold in the invoice. She said that the serial number is unique. She stated that the Patek Philippe Nautilus is a high-value watch and was probably the only model that was available in Singapore.

198    She was referred to the WhatsApp chat (P13) on 14 and 15 October 2018, 18, 22 and 27 February 2019 between her handphone XXX and customer, Wang, who used the handphone number XXX. She stated the customer first enquired about different models of watches on 14 and 15 October 2018. However, he did not make any purchase.

199    On 18 February 2019, he enquired about the watch in question. He was quoted a sale price of $348,000. Next, on 22 February 2019 at 1.29pm, he enquired about the watch in question again and asked “Best price? brand new right”. Angela replied, “Cash deal best is 346,000.” He asked her if he needed to make an appointment. She told him that ‘walk-in is fine’ At 2.45pm, he asked her the operating hours. She replied that the shop is open between 11am and 7pm. At 3.10pm, the accused messaged that he would come today.

200    She recollected that the accused called to meet at ION instead of the shop. Angela said the request was rejected as it was felt safer to deal in the shop and there was a lot of cash to be counted. She was unable to remember what time the accused came to the shop. She said that he was given a further discount of $1,000 and he paid $345,000 in cash.

201    On 24 February 2019, the customer sent a message to enquire if any message has been sent to the number which he registered. Angela checked the invoice and understood that he was referring to the number stated on the invoice because the WhatsApp number that he had been using was different. Angela replied that she did not.

202    On 26 February 2019, he enquired if there was another identical watch. She told him that was the only piece. He enquired about other watches but did not make any other purchase.

203    Under cross-examination, Angela said that it was common to get enquiries about watches. She confirmed that there is a Patek Philippe store in ION. Asked if the customer had suggested to meet at the Patek Philippe store so that he could check if the watch is authentic and make a comparison of its price, she answered she was unable to remember if the customer had suggested that.

### Evidence of PW12 – Senior Staff Sergeant Azfarullah Bin Abul Aziz (‘SSSgt Azfar’)

204    SSSgt Azfar testified that on 4 March 2019, the complainant, Amos, called Investigation Officer (‘IO’) Eddie Ho Fu Lin (‘IO Eddie’), who was the IO of the case then, and told him that he has detained the money changer at Orchard Gateway. He stated that the police received a few other calls on 4 March 2019 in connection with the incident, and one of the calls was from the accused who alleged that he was assaulted.

205    SSSgt Azfar proceeded to the location with IO Eddie. He stated that uniformed police officers were already there when he arrived. He said Amos, Jonathan and the accused were present. The owner of Sanctuary Gaming was at his store. In cross-examination, SSSgt Azfar said the gaming store had an open concept entrance/exit which was about two meters from the lift lobby. When he arrived, he saw the accused standing behind the wall of the store at around the lift lobby with two police officers.

206    SSSgt Azfar said that IO Eddie interviewed Amos in his presence. Subsequently, SSSgt Azfar interviewed the accused. He asked him how he knew or is related to Amos and Jonathan. The accused initially denied knowing them. SSSgt Azfar asked the accused if he is able to prove that he does not know them, or if he has anything to share. He said the accused did not say much but was fidgeting with his handphone which he was holding in his hand. SSSgt Azfar seized the Samsung Galaxy A9 mobile phone as he suspected that the accused may destroy the evidence in it. He asked the accused to unlock and deactivate his phone’s security function. The accused complied. SSSgt Azfar then keyed in the handphone number of Amos and found multiple call logs. He confronted the accused on how there could be multiple call logs if he did not know Amos. The accused then changed his story and said that Amos and Jonathan had some dealings but he was not part of it and he did not take the money. He said the accused also alleged that he was assaulted by Amos and Amos’ friend and pointed to his face. However, SSSgt Azfar did not see any visible injury. He told the accused that he will send him for a medical examination.

207    He stated that Amos brought to his attention the Patek Philippe watch. He said the accused admitted that he owns the watch. SSSgt Azfar stated the watch was seized. Two photographs were taken of the watch (see P15-1 and P15-2).

208    The accused was arrested for cheating and taken to Tanglin Police Division in order to be sent for a medical examination. On the next day, the accused was escorted to Bedok Police Division. Sometime in the evening, SSSgt Azfar brought the accused for scene visits. SSSgt Azfar brought the accused’s phone and other belongings with him. After the accused was returned to the lock-up, he spoke to the accused. SSSgt Azfar still had the accused’s phone with him. He did not find any chat logs between the accused and Amos or Jonathan in the accused’s handphone. However, he found Amos’ contact details were saved in the accused’s handphone. He asked the accused if there was any evidence in this handphone which will exonerate or be able to explain the allegation. He said the accused did not reveal anything.

209    On 15 April 2019, SSSgt Azfar requested Senior Forensic Examiner, Ding Xan Chong, of the Cyber Crime Response Team from Bedok Division to conduct a search of the digital contents of the mobile phone of the accused. SSgt Azfar confirmed that he viewed the extracted contents and identified to the examiner which contents were relevant. He said the forensic examiner downloaded those contents into a CD. He stated that documents P9 and P27 were extracted from the accused’s handphone.

210    The footages showing the scene at Sunshine Plaza, the service road at the rear of NAFA campus, the road in front of the provision shop and at Sanctuary Gaming were retrieved or recorded by SSSgt Azfar and admitted collectively as P21. SSSgt Azfar ascertained that the timings in the footage of Sunshine Plaza did not reflect the real time. He said there was a difference of one or two minutes with the real time.

211    SSSgt Azfar obtained the accused’s travel history from Grab and Gojek (see P18 and P19 respectively). Based on the Gojek travel history, the accused boarded a Gojek car on 22 February 2019 at 5.18pm at Sunshine Plaza & Residences and alighted at Far East Shopping Centre at 5.38pm. Based on the Grab travel history, he was picked up at 6.08pm at ION Orchard and alighted at 390 Victoria Street.

212    SSSgt Azfar stated that Amos surrendered commission of $7,675, Jonathan surrendered $1,000 and Jay $3,950 in March 2019.

213    Under cross-examination, SSSgt Azfar disagreed that the accused did not see his phone after it was seized on 4 March 2019. He said that he (SSSgt Azfar) had the phone with him when he questioned the accused during the remand period, and he had asked the accused where the evidence which would exonerate or explain the complaint against him was in his phone.

214    SSSgt Azfar agreed that the accused asked him to repeatedly check the phones of the witnesses for their messages. He said the accused was simply asking ‘Have you found anything’. In re-examination, he clarified that the accused did not refer to any WeChat messages with Jonathan whilst he was in remand. He said that the issue of WeChat messages was only raised in representations in January 2021. He stated that Jonathan did not have any WeChat log with the accused then.

215    He agreed that the accused asked him repeatedly to obtain the CCTV footage at Toast Box located in Eastpoint Mall for 23 February 2019. SSSgt Azfar stated that he checked with the management but the footage was no longer available due to the delay on his part in making the request.

### Evidence of PW13 – Ong Chin Goom (‘Ong’)

216    Ong is the Vice President of Account Services with the Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation (‘OCBC’). She produced the credit card statements of the accused. She stated that as of January 2019, the accused was owing $62,583.14 and he had exceeded the available credit limit by $2,583.14. She stated that he had 23 calendar days to settle either the minimum sum of $6,293.78 or the full amount to avoid being charged interest.

217    She confirmed that on 22 February 2019 at 6.04pm, a cash payment of $63,000 was made over-the counter at OCBC ION Orchard Branch by the accused towards his credit card bill. She identified the slip for the deposit of the $63,000 cash (see P24).

218    On 26 February 2018, a further sum of $16,000 and $5,000 was paid at OCBC ION Orchard Branch in cash via the ATM (see P23) towards the credit card bill.

219    Under cross-examination, she was referred to the accused’s credit card statement for April 2018 (see D4-Tab A). She agreed that the accused made an over-the-counter cash deposit of $30,000 on 18 April 2018 towards payment of his credit card bill. She confirmed that there was a cash payment via the ATM of $2,700 on 8 June 2018 and cash payments via the ATM of $2,100 and $4,900 on 16 June 2018 towards the credit card debt. She also confirmed that the accused made two cash payments via the ATM of $10,000 each on 22 October 2018 and three cash payments via the ATM totalling $24,900 on 22 October 2018 towards the credit card debt.

### Evidence of PW14 – Home Team Specialist (‘HTS’) Ding Xian Cong (‘HTS Ding’)

220    HTS Ding is a senior forensic examiner of the Cyber Crime Response Team from Bedok Police Division.

221    On 15 April 2019 at the request of SSSgt Azfar, HTS Ding conducted a search of the digital contents of the accused’s Samsung Galaxy A9 mobile phone to retrieve chat messages, documents and images related to the cheating case. He powered up the phone without any Internet connection to prevent any interference with the stored data. He extracted the data from the phone and the memory card by means of forensic software. He stated that the data was extracted successfully. He said that his search was non-exhaustive as only the ‘live’ data was extracted. By ‘live’ data, he explained that it referred to data which a user can search from the phone. HTS Ding had attempted to use a more thorough method of forensic extraction of data but it could not be used on the phone.

222    HTS Ding was unable to extract any chat messages from the phone memory and memory card. He said he was only able to extract the media files. He stated that SSSgt Azfar viewed the extracted contents and selected the relevant contents. HTS Ding listed out the files that were selected in Annex A to C of his report.

223    HTS Ding confirmed that the three photographs marked as P26 (serial nos. 17, 28 and 44 in Annex B) were extracted from the phone. He confirmed that document P9 (s/no. 26 in Annex B) and P27 (serial no. 42 in Annex B) were extracted from the phone. HTS Ding stated that based on the file path, P27 could have originated from either the WeChat or QQ messenger applications.

224    Under cross-examination, he stated that P9 and P27 were extracted from the data in the phone. He said he was unable to ascertain if the documents were sent to the phone and agreed that it was possible.

## Defence case

### Evidence of DW1 – Accused

225    From 2013 or 2014 to 2017, the accused was a relationship manager with various banks. From around 2018, he has been assisting his wife and mother to rent properties to students from China. He tendered his IRAS Notices of Assessment which stated his earned income in 2016 to be $285,623, in 2018 as $98,391 and $25,877 in 2019.

226    He testified that he trades in luxury watches and trading cards. He tendered 12 invoices for the purchase of watches between 2015 and 2017 from Chuan Watch Collection Pte. Ltd. (‘Chuan Watch’) and six invoices for the sale of watches to Chuan Watch between 2015 and 2017.

227    As regards Jonathan, he was introduced to him by Jerry at Sanctuary Gaming in 2018. He said they became friends and he confided in him about family issues. They communicated via WhatsApp, WeChat and Telegram. He claimed that Jonathan told him he has a Taiwanese client who does online betting and forex trading and suggested to him to introduce clients for a referral fee. He claimed the ‘Indon’ in the WhatsApp message from Jonathan on 14 January 2019 at 11.26.26pm, ‘_U take money from the Indon and the cards from ur fren yet both_.” referred to an Indonesian client whom he introduced to Jonathan for a foreign exchange transaction. However, the Indonesian did not proceed with the transaction and Jonathan was liable to pay a penalty. He asserted that the message on 16 January 2019 at 11.12.35am, “_I need to recoup the funds to that indon guy first_” referred to the penalty which Jonathan had to pay.

228    With respect to Amos, he was introduced to him by one Michael who is a businessman. He asked Michael if he has clients who want to invest in property and that he (accused) could assist to rent the properties to students. He met Michael and Amos at the car park of Beauty World on 14 February 2019. He told Amos he was renting properties to students, and asked him to refer clients who want to purchase or rent properties. Amos told him he was doing soccer betting and providing money exchange services and had also done remittances.

229    With respect to his message on 15 February 2018 at 12.22pm to Amos to “_Ignore the MC. See TG._”, he confirmed ‘MC’ referred to moneychanger. He said Amos showed him ‘some documents’ on 14 February 2019 which appeared suspicious and he had continued to send him weird ‘stuff’ through Telegram and he accordingly sent the message.

230    With respect to the transaction of S$600,000 in question, he said his role was simply to refer Amos to Jonathan. He was not expecting any remuneration and just wanted to be on Jonathan and Amos’ good side. He said this was because he was asking Jonathan for a job opportunity with his employer and wanted Amos to refer clients who were interested in investing in property. Asked why the details of the beneficiary were sent to him, he gave the following evidence[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4):

> A    Maybe, uh, this was probably sent to me to confirm with Jonathan whether if the details are correct.

> …

> A    I can only forward or send to Jonathan whatever that was sent to me.

231    As to how the meeting place at Sunshine Plaza was arranged, he said it was suggested by Jonathan as he would always come to the town area and added he had checked with Jonathan as he (accused) was renting out units in the area and always needed to be there.

232    He stated that Jonathan requested him to bring him up to level 3 of the carpark and he did so by walking up the carpark ramp with him. Thereafter, he (accused) left the carpark and went to a wanton noodle shop at level 1 of Sunshine Plaza to have his lunch and tea. Shortly, Amos met him there. Around 5 to 10 minutes later, Amos received a call from his client. Amos told him that he will bring the client to meet the moneychanger upstairs and left.

233    About 10 to 15 minutes later, he met Amos for a smoke outside 7-Eleven. After 5 to 10 minutes later, Amos went to meet his client and the moneychanger because there was a dispute. The accused said he then went to buy lottery at the Singapore Pools building which is across the road from Sunshine Plaza. Whilst he was there, he received a call from Jonathan who told him that he needed to meet him as there was a change in plan.

234    Jonathan met him outside the Singapore Pools building. He had a bag of cash with him. He asked him to pass the bag to Amos. Jonathan told him the bag was damaged and he (Jonathan) went to a shop to get a plastic bag. He passed the plastic bag to him to place the bag of cash in it. Jonathan took out $1,000 from the bag to give to him for introducing the business but he declined because he was owing Jonathan money for cards. Jonathan then kept the $1,000.

235    The accused said he tried to call Amos at 3.50pm and 3.51pm to find out what was going on. However, Amos did not answer his calls. He texted Amos via Telegram. He also called him at 5.01pm. At 5.10pm, Amos replied, “_Later meet than say._” He went on to say that Amos wanted to meet him on the same day to collect the bag of money but was unable to do so.

236    As regards the MT103 (P10), he initially said that he saw it on or after the transaction date. He claimed he was unable to remember if it was sent to him by Amos or Jonathan via Telegram or WeChat. Subsequently, he said it was sent to him probably around 3.40 or 3.50pm on the day of the transaction. He was asked[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5):

> Q    Okay. When you received this either through WeChat or Telegram, did you look at this MT103?

> A    No, because I’m not supposed to even---it doesn’t even concern me because I’m not the one doing any remittance. Why---why am I receiving this?

237    As regards the redacted bank statement admitted as exhibit P9, he said it was sent to him by Jonathan because he (accused) asked him if his client was trustworthy. With respect to exhibit P27, he said it was sent to him either by Jonathan or Amos.

238    As regards the Patek Philippe watch and the payment of his credit card bill, the accused claimed he brought $450,000 cash from home before he proceeded to Sunshine Plaza, which he put in his bermudas pockets. He stated that he first enquired about the watch on 18 February 2019. As regards the payment towards his credit card bill, he said he had been paying his credit card bills in cash most of the time.

239    On 23 February 2019 at around 9.35pm, he met Amos at Toast Box at Eastpoint Mall. He said it was a two to three minute walk to the mall from his block. He brought along the bag of money to pass to Amos. He said his father had seen the bag of money on the floor in their flat and questioned him about it. He told him he was returning it to someone. His father told him that he would follow him from a distance to ensure that he is not robbed. He said his father stopped at the fire hydrant from which he could see the Toast Box. The accused claimed that he handed the bag immediately to Amos. He was with Amos for about 15 minutes. He claimed Amos told him that he does not intend to give commission to some of the people involved and he might text him some ‘funny stuff’ and asked him not to reply to the messages.

240    On 4 March 2019, sometime in the afternoon, he booked a private hire vehicle from Sunshine Plaza to go to Sanctuary Gaming at Orchard Gateway. He was referred to his police statement which was recorded on 11 March 2019, in which he stated, _“… I was at Sunshine Plaza when he spotted me and run towards me and damage the \[G\]rab door_.” He claimed that he did not see Amos at that juncture and added that he does not know why Amos acted in that manner.

241    About 10 to 15 minutes after he arrived at the store, he heard one man shouting and he was immediately head locked by another. He noticed one of the men was Amos. He asked Jerry to call the police and he also called the police to report the assault. He said Amos was scolding him but he was unable to recall what he said as he was in pain and shock. He said he was wearing the Patek Phillipe watch and asked Jerry to keep it as he did not want it to have any scratch marks.

242    After 15 to 20 minutes, the first two police officers arrived. IO Azfar arrived later at the scene, and questioned him as to whether he knew why he was assaulted. He told him he did not know. IO Azfar asked him if he knows Amos. He admitted that he knows him but said they are not close. He was asked to surrender his phone and unlock it. He complied and removed the passcode. He denied that IO Azfar checked his phone and found Amos’ number in it.

243    He testified that Jonathan also came to Sanctuary Gaming. He said he did not know who had called him.

244    He asked IO Azfar to send the handphones of all parties involved for forensic examination. He told IO Azfar that he communicated with Jonathan via WhatsApp, WeChat and Telegram and with Amos via WhatsApp and Telegram. He claimed he was not shown his phone during investigations. He stated he only saw his phone in January 2021 when he went to the police division with his counsel but all his chat logs with Jonathan and Amos were no longer available.

### Evidence of DW2 – Ong Tiong Leong (‘Ong TL’)

245    Ong TL is the father of the accused. He stays at Block 123 Simei Street 1 with his wife and younger son. He said the accused would sometimes come to stay at the flat.

246    He testified that the accused divorced in 2016 and he ‘used to bring lots of money back home’ when he was going through the divorce. He said he told him not to carry so much cash and not to leave it around. He added that he did not know where he kept the cash.

247    Asked if the accused had any other sources of income apart from his job when he was a banker, he said that he did not know. He said he noticed the accused used to change his watch often. He stated that he did know how many watches the accused had in his possession at any one time.

248    On 23 February 2019 sometime after 8pm, the accused was in his room. He went into the room to have a chat with him. He saw a bag of money on the floor. He asked the accused about the money. The accused told him he is going to return it to a friend. He asked the accused where he will be handing the money. The accused told him that he is meeting his friend at Toast Box at Eastpoint Mall. He said he decided to accompany the accused.

249    Upon nearing Toast Box, the accused pointed at a man who was seated at the table and told him that he is meeting him. Ong TL said that he then stopped walking. He said that he was then at the bicycle bay of the MRT station. He saw the accused handing over the plastic bag and sitting down. He said that he then moved off.

250    Asked how he was able to remember the date, he said it happened a ‘few days’ before three people came to his flat to look for the accused. Asked how many days before, he replied ‘Can I refuse to answer this question?’. Asked why he did not want to answer, he replied that it was totally irrelevant. Asked why it was irrelevant, he said, “_You’re asking for actual date, I told you 23rd February 2019. I also told you that day, I can remember because of the amount of cash my son is carrying_.”

251    On 26 February 2019 sometime after 9pm, one man, a lady and another person whom he did not see came to his flat and kept knocking on the door. Asked if he was certain of the date, he replied ‘Quite certain’. He opened the door. They told him they were looking for Willie. He told them that he was not in and closed the door. Under cross-examination, he said that they came on 29 February 2019. He then said it was either on 26th or 29th. When it was pointed to him the last date in February was 28th, he then said that it should be the 26th. Asked if he was able to remember which day of the week it was, he said that it was a weekday but he was unable to remember which day of the week it was. He finally agreed that he was not sure of the date. However, when it was put that the three persons came to his flat on a day after 26th February 2019, he disagreed.

## Findings

252    The incontrovertible evidence is that Roy wanted to transfer S$600,000 in US dollars to the bank account of one Shoji, in February 2019. Shoji has a bank account with BOS. Roy informed his friend, Sean, who is a banker at BOS of the intended transfer. On Sean’s evidence, which I accepted, Roy had transferred funds via BOS to Shoji prior to February 2019. This time round, Sean offered to help Roy find a moneychanger who would be able to offer a better rate than the bank rate. Roy agreed. Sean decided to ask Jay, whom he knew and had dealt with to exchange money, to enquire about the exchange rate which he could obtain. This triggered a chain reaction from Jay to Rosanna to Yanni to Eileen and finally to Amos to source for a money changer. In this chain of persons, I accepted that Jay only knew Rosanna, Rosanna knew only Yannie, and Yannie knew only Eileen. Amos only knew Eileen initially and he was given the contact number of Yannie by Eileen in relation to this transaction.

253    The accused gave trenchant evidence protesting his innocence and claimed to be the victim of a sinister conspiracy. He called his father, Ong TL, in support of his defence. I found the accused and Ong TL’s evidence unworthy of acceptance and disbelieved their evidence.

#### Was Jonathan a remittance service provider?

254    I accepted Jonathan’s evidence that the accused had asked him to introduce clients for money changing services. Jonathan’s WhatsApp messages with the accused support his evidence. On 27 December 2018 at 9.06pm, after getting to know Jonathan, the accused asked for an update on the prospects of referrals to him (‘_Update me lol’_). At 10.50pm, he followed up by urging Jonathan to ask his customers for opportunities. (‘_U go ask your customers see got lobang Not_’). Jonathan was then working as an account manager with Oracle, and I accepted his evidence that the accused was referring to his (Jonathan) IT clients by ‘your customers’. On the next day, the accused again exhorted Jonathan to check with his clients. The messages were:

> _11:11:45 to 11.11:53 am (Accused):_

> \[You\] mention \[you\] got a few customer right. Lol. Try asking the other lei.’.

> _11:11:57 to 11:12:06 (Jonathan):_

> Not really. The others not so close. And the amount not so huge.

> _11:12:06 to 11:12:15 (Accused):_

> Try la. Ask is free. Start small lol.

> _11:12:18 (Jonathan)_

> Ten twenty k at most

> _11:12:26 to 11:12 (Accused)_

> That one cannot la. lol \[You\] ask them then \[you\] tell them minimum vol. lol. See what they say.

> …

> _11.49.10am (Accused)_

> Meanwhile check with customers and update me when we meet.

255    In the cross-examination of Jonathan, it was put that these messages related to the accused introducing clients for the remittance service that Jonathan was providing. However, the accused changed his position when he gave evidence. He then asserted these messages related to trading cards, and he was trying to get others to invest in them. The accused was unable to give a credible explanation for the fundamental change in position. I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that “the references to amounts and volumes (“amount not so huge”, minimum vol\[ume\])” were consistent with Jonathan’s evidence. The messages also clearly show that it was the accused who was pressing Jonathan to refer customers to him and was asking for updates.

256    The accused asserted that the messages which referred to an “Indon” concerned an Indonesian client whom he had introduced to Jonathan for a money changing/remittance transaction, and Jonathan ended up paying a penalty as the Indonesian client eventually did not proceed with the transaction. The accused gave no evidence on the penalty sum that was allegedly payable. There was also no logical basis provided for why a penalty was payable. In any case, the following messages show that there was no truth in the accused’s assertion:

> _16/1/19 at 11:12:00 to 11:12:18am \[Accused):_

> \[You\] really siao ome. The new planes Walker \[you\] ordered?

> _16/1/19 at 11:12:21am (Jonathan)_

> Nah. I stop first.

> _16/1/19 at 11:12:34am (accused)_

> LOL

> _16/1/19 at 11:12:35 (Jonathan)_

> I need to recoup the funds to that indon guy first. That one **damn heavy investment**. **That one don’t come back**, I kanna chase out also. Haha.

> _16/1/19 (Accused)_

> LOL

257    The reference to “investment” and “That one don’t come back” makes it clear that Jonathan could not have been referring to a remittance transaction and the payment of a penalty. I found the following explanation by Jonathan that he had bought trading cards to trade with an Indonesian which did not materialise to have a clear impress of truth[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6):

> 
| 

Court:

 | 

So, what does this refer to, “I need to recoup the funds”?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Sure. Your Honour, so I still spent a large amount of money on the Magic: The Gathering cards, uh, via an online shop that I do purchased the, uh, cards from. Uh, so thereafter, you know, receiving those cards, uh, I was instructed by the accused to do a trade, uh, with this particular Indonesian person, which I do not have know---knowledge of, uh, however, that did not take place, and the rough amount would be around 4,000 to 5,000 Singapore Dollars.

 |

  
  

258    The accused claimed that there was a WeChat message where Jonathan had stated in Mandarin to the effect ‘Don’t worry, my boss side will handle everything’ which related to the transaction in question. SSSgt Azfar stated that the existence of the alleged WeChat message with Jonathan was first raised on behalf of the accused in January 2021 through a letter of representations. He stated that the accused did not mention any WeChat message with Jonathan when he was questioned in the course of investigations. I rejected the accused’s evidence that there was such a WeChat message. First, if this message was crucial, then the accused ought not to have deleted his WeChat conversation with Jonathan. I rejected the accused’s evidence that he had his messages with Jonathan and Amos when he was arrested. I accepted SSSgt Azfar’s evidence that there were no chat logs with Jonathan and Amos found in the accused’s handphone. Second, he ought reasonably to have informed SSSgt Azfar in the course of investigations of such a message, which he did not. In the upshot, I accepted Jonathan’s evidence that he did not send such a message.

259    Accordingly, I rejected the evidence of the accused that Jonathan was providing a remittance service.

#### Was Amos a moneychanger?

260    It is not in dispute that Amos was introduced to the accused by Michael who is known to both the accused and Amos. Amos’ evidence was straightforward. He was looking for someone to do a money changing/ remittance transaction at the request of Eileen, and Michael gave him the accused’s contact number. The accused, on the other hand, took materially inconsistent positions. During the cross-examination of Amos, it was put to him that the introduction took place because the accused was looking for job opportunities in the oil and gas sector. However, when the accused gave evidence, his story changed materially. In examination-in-chief, he asserted that he asked Amos if he had clients who wanted to purchase or rent property. He went on to allege that Amos shared he was doing ‘shady stuff’ like soccer betting and money exchange services. Under cross-examination, the accused tried to glibly explain his inconsistent positions by claiming the “first thing” that he asked Amos was which industry he was in. Amos told him that he was in the oil and gas sector and he asked for any job openings and business opportunities. It is evident from this answer that the accused had no clue what Amos did for a living prior to the introduction. It must therefore follow that he could not have been introduced to Amos because he was looking for opportunities in ‘oil and gas’ and/or clients who wanted to invest in or rent properties.

261    I found the truth was as testified to by Amos, i.e. the introduction took place because Amos had told Michael he was looking for someone to do a money changing/ remittance transaction. I found it was for that reason Amos was given the contact number of the accused and the subsequent physical meeting took place on 14 February 2019 at the location which the accused proposed.

262    The WhatsApp messages also amply support Amos’ evidence. Following the meet-up, on 15 Feb 2019 at 12.22pm, the accused messaged to Amos to ignore the moneychanger and don’t bother dealing with any moneychanger. The accused attempted to downplay this message by making some ambivalent claims that Amos had been sending him “stuff” which made ‘no logical sense’. To begin with, this was not even put to Amos. In addition, the accused’s message ‘Don’t bother dealing with any MC’ clearly shows the accused wanted Amos to deal only with him, as testified to by Amos. The message not only lends credence to Amos’ testimony on why the accused was introduced to him but puts it beyond doubt that Amos did not hold himself out as being a moneychanger.

263    Between 15 and 19 February 2019, the accused repeatedly asked Amos to call him and called Amos every day. At 5.50pm on 15 February 2019, he messaged ‘_Any updates not. If too late I think I have to call off. By 7. Else close shop le’_. I rejected the accused’s explanation that he was enquiring on behalf of Jonathan. The message clearly shows the accused was not enquiring on behalf of anyone.

264    The following messages on 19 February 2019 show the accused’s financial desperation in soliciting opportunities to earn money, and that he was not flushed with cash to the tune of $460,000 to $500,000, as he claimed, but was quite desperate to earn some income. The messages read:

> _19/02/2019 at 10:12 (Amos)_:

> Not easy to find gd deal bro.

> _19/02/2019 at 1012 to 10:13 (Accused)_

> Cash to cash gd also. Ty. Yea.

> _19/02/2019 at 10:13 (Amos)_

> Very quiet recently.

> _19/02/2019 at 21:01 (Accused)_

> K bro, if got lobang share a bit la. If support the card one I can at least earn abit money la. Or got wire biz also good la. No support \[nothing\] to earn. Dam sian. If later \[you\] free call me talk 2 mins can le. Won’t take up too much of your time one.

The accused sought to deflect the references to “Cash to cash” and “wire biz” by claiming that those were services which Jonathan rendered through his Taiwanese client. It is quite plain from the tenor of the messages that the accused was soliciting opportunities for himself. I found the messages were consistent with the fact that the accused had represented himself to be able to provide money changing/remittance services and he was asking Amos to refer customers for that purpose. I rejected the accused’s evidence that these were services which Jonathan was to perform. I found that to be a blatant lie.

265    Further, exhibits P9 and P27 which Amos testified were sent to him by the accused were extracted from the accused’s handphone. P9 was found in a directory called “Photo editor 2” with the date ‘2019.02.18’. P27 is an unedited version of P9 and was also found in the accused’s handphone. In examination-in-chief, the accused claimed that P9 was sent to him by Jonathan because he had asked him if his client was trustworthy. As regards P27, he said it was sent either by Amos or Jonathan. In cross-examination, he claimed that either Jonathan or Amos sent him ‘something’ and Amos asked him to do a check but claimed he was unable to remember what check he was required to do and why. I rejected the accused’s evidence. It did not make any sense for Amos and/or Jonathan to send to the accused an edited and an unedited version of the same document. As regards his claim in examination-in-chief, it does not stand to reason why the accused would enquire about the credibility of the client if his role was a go-between. In cross-examination, he gave a different vague reason and was unable to substantiate why P9 and P27 were allegedly sent to him.

266    I found that both P9 and P27 were found in the accused’s handphone because he had created P9 by editing P27 and it is for that reason P9 was found in the directory called ‘Photo editor 2’. I found that the accused sent P9 to Amos to assure him that he was able to perform the money changing and remittance service.

267    In cross-examination of the accused, the allegation that Amos acted as the money changer in the transaction in question unraveled itself at one stage. He stated that he did not know if Amos was doing the transaction[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7) or had any other role[^8] apart from being the point of contact. He was asked by the learned DPP to explain his evidence in chief that Amos would do the money changing activity. The accused gave incoherent and irrelevant answers and did not explain the contradiction.[^9] Subsequently he reverted to his allegation that Amos was involved as a money changer in the transaction.

268    I found the accused’s evidence that Amos was involved as a money changer in the transaction was completely lacking in credibility.

#### Did the accused falsely represent that he would carry out the transaction?

269    I accepted Eileen’s evidence that she was informed of the transaction by Yannie and was asked if she knew any moneychanger. I accepted her evidence that as a result she asked her client, Amos, if he knew of any good contact. I accepted her evidence that Amos informed her that he had a contact, and she then put him in touch with Yannie, and she was not involved any further.

270    The accused claimed to be the go-between because Jonathan did not want Amos’ contact. Asked what reason Jonathan provided for not wanting to liaise with Amos, he claimed that Jonathan simply said there was no need and he would go through him. I found that this was a lie which the accused had conjured up to justify his alleged go-between role. The WhatsApp messages between Amos and the accused show affirmatively that it was the accused who was handling the transaction and not Amos and Jonathan.

271    At 13:48 on 21 February 2019, it was the accused who quoted the exchange rate of 1.348 to Amos. At 13:49pm, Amos replied ‘Ok’. The messages that follow show the accused telling Amos how long it would take to complete the transaction:

> _21/02/2019 at 13:49 (Accused)_

> Same day impossible. Cross country.

> 21/02/2019 at 13:50 (Amos)

> If \[from\] sg to bos? In usd can do same day \[right\].

> _21/02/2019 at 13:50 (Accused)_

> Wire from HK impossible same day. Especially the timing now. Not possible. And amount \[you\] mention impossible.

Amos’ reply immediately to the message at 13:50 to the effect “_Wait I tell them from \[your\] side request to deal \[tomorrow\].”_ shows clearly that Amos believed he was dealing with the accused. His next message at 13:51, “_1.358.. Outside can give how much_.”, if Amos had indeed represented himself as a money changer, he would not have made such an odd query on exchange rates to the accused. Amos’ query shows he was just a conduit, as he had testified. The accused replied immediately, “_Your other side cmi? Can give till 1.357 also people will do_.” Amos replied, “_Now is 1.35_.” The accused replied stating that some rates were special and referred to ‘interbank rate’ and ended off by saying ‘_Else how MC \[moneychanger\] survive_’. If Amos was indeed the money changer, it is preposterous for the accused to make the remark ‘_Else how MC survive’_ to Amos.

272    There was a further conversation on exchange rates between 1.50 to 2.10 pm. In particular, at 14.10pm, Amos messaged, “_They wan 1.35. U thijk ok bo_.” The accused replied immediately at 14.10pm, “_Can do_”. It is clear from the immediate reply of the accused that he was calling the shots. Again at 16:14pm, consistent with this understanding that the accused was handling the transaction, Amos stated ‘_\[Your\] side don’t confirm anything to \[your\] boss. I will get a confirmation \[from\] my side den I will tell u. I have told them.. I will want to meet them up den go with them._” It is plain that Amos was not pushing for the transaction to go through. Instead, he said that he will get a confirmation from his side and told the accused not to confirm anything.

273    On the other hand, the messages show that it was the accused who was eager to have the transaction done through himself. On 22 February 2019 at 10.18am, the accused broached the subject. He asked Amos to update him if the transaction was going ahead. Amos replied at 10.21am that he will update “_if they call me again_”. The accused replied within the next second and said, “_Ty if ok try to call n ask as I also need inform also if want do_.” If the accused was just acting as a ‘referral’, there was no need for him to urge Amos to try and call. At 10.39, he messaged ‘USD spike’. Again, the accused would have no reason to send this message if he had not represented he was the money changer/remittance provider. At 12.18pm, when Amos asked what the rate was to ‘wire 600k’, the accused asked him to use the Telegram chat instead. Under cross-examination, the accused’s evidence took a bizarre twist at times when he said that he did not understand what the message ‘wire 600k’ meant[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10). At one stage he said his understanding was that Amos was ‘asking for a remittance person’. I found the accused was simply making up evidence in an attempt to distance himself.

274    Thereafter, Amos asked the accused where to meet, sent him the particulars of the beneficiary, the amount in USD and asked if the amount was correct, and told him that they are going over now. The accused gave inconsistent explanations on why the details of the transaction were sent to him by Amos. In cross-examination, it was put to Amos that he sent the particulars of the beneficiary for the accused to check because of his previous experience as a banker, to which Amos disagreed. In cross-examination, the accused claimed the details of the transaction were sent to him to forward to Jonathan and he was not required to check the details. I found the inconsistencies arose because the accused was giving a lying account on his involvement. I found that Amos was conveying the details of the transaction to the accused because the accused had represented himself to be the money changer/remittance provider and Amos believed the accused would do the transaction. I rejected the accused’s evidence that he was passing messages to Jonathan. I found the accused’s evidence that he was liaising with Amos because Jonathan did not want his contact to be passed to Amos to be a lie.

#### The events at Sunshine Plaza

275    It was the accused who decided on the venue of Sunshine Plaza. However, he disputed that he decided that the parties should go up to the car park. The accused accounted for his presence at Sunshine Plaza by asserting that his role was to ‘introduce’ Amos and Jonathan for them to do the transaction[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11). It is incontrovertible that the accused did not introduce Jonathan to Amos. To get around this damning fact, he claimed he did not meet Amos before he went up to the car park with Jonathan.

276    At about 3.26pm at Sunshine Plaza, the accused met Jonathan and led him to outside the 7-Eleven at Sunshine Plaza. It is an incontrovertible fact that the accused and Jonathan went up the ramp of the car park at about 3.44pm, which is about 18 minutes later. The accused’s evidence is conspicuously silent on what he did during the 18 minutes or so. I found Jonathan’s evidence to have a clear ring of truth. I accepted Jonathan’s evidence that the accused was with him for about five minutes and the accused told him that he needed his help to count close to $600,000. The accused added that he was waiting for the contact to arrive. I accepted Amos’ evidence that he arrived at about 3.30pm. This was consistent with Jonathan’s evidence that after about five minutes, the accused told him that he needed to go and meet his contact inside the building and asked him to stay put.

277    I accepted Amos’ evidence that he met the accused inside Sunshine Plaza where they sat outside an eatery at the first floor. The fact that the accused and Amos sat outside an eatery is confirmed by Jonathan’s evidence. I found that Jonathan was able to attest to this detail because his evidence that he was curious and went inside the building where he spotted the accused seated with a man at the tables and chairs placed outside an eatery at the first floor was true.

278    As the venue of Sunshine Plaza was chosen by the accused, in response to my questions as to where he intended for the parties to meet there, he gave the following evidence[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12):

> 
| 

Court:

 | 

So, where did you want them to meet at Sunshine Plaza?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

I just wanted them to meet up, and then they can take it from there.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

What do you mean by take it from there?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Because the main idea was letting both parties that were going to do the transaction, for them to meet up and do the transaction that day---wanted to do. This was because Jonathan---if Jonathan had allowed me to pass his contact to Amos, I wouldn’t even have to be in such a hassle.

 |

  
  

The accused claimed it was Jonathan who wanted to go up to the car park but he did not know why. It was his evidence that he did not ask why. This was indeed strange as Amos was still at the first floor waiting for the client. I rejected the accused’s evidence that Jonathan decided to go up to level 3 of the carpark. The evidence clearly established that the accused kept Jonathan separate from Amos. He clearly did not want to introduce them and let them ‘take it from there’ on where to meet, as he claimed.

279    I found Jonathan to be a witness of truth. I accepted his evidence that his purpose of being at Sunshine Plaza was because he agreed to the accused’s request to assist to count money but he did not know the background to the request. I accepted Jonathan’s evidence that the accused met him again and led him up the car park ramp (as seen in the footage) to the third level and told him where to wait to count the money. I accepted Jonathan’s evidence that the accused told him to bring the money to PoMo mall after he had counted it. Thereafter, the accused went down the carpark by the staircase.

280    Shortly before 3.53pm, Jay arrived at Sunshine Plaza. He was carrying a white paper bag with cash which he had received from Sean. He had removed the commission of S$3,950 from the bag, leaving a balance of S$596,050 in it. I accepted Jay’s evidence that he had not met or spoken to Amos prior to this stage and he had only received Amos’ contact number from Rosanna. When Amos met Jay, Amos brought him up to the car park where the accused had informed him that his (accused) worker would be waiting. Thereafter, Amos left Jay with Jonathan and went to meet the accused outside 7-Eleven as he had been requested to do so.

281    The accused did not provide any credible explanation as to why he did not introduce Jonathan and Amos if his (accused) true role was that of a go-between and Amos and Jonathan were the dramatis personae. I found the accused could not have made the introduction because to do so would have been inconsistent with his representation to Amos that Jonathan was his worker. I found it was the accused who decided that the money will be counted at the third level of the carpark. I found it was for that reason he led Jonathan up the ramp and brought him to a secluded place at the third floor and thereafter made his way back down again. The objective evidence shows that the accused immediately left the car park via the staircase. I found the accused immediately made his way down as part of his plan to perpetrate the deception to obtain the monies.

282    Jay’s evidence that he did not know Jonathan and was suspicious as to why the money was being counted in the car park is supported by the fact that Jay took a photograph of Jonathan counting the cash (see P3). Jay also did not allow Jonathan to leave with the cash until he had received the proof of transfer. Jonathan confirmed that he was not allowed to leave until Jay had received the alleged proof. Even on the accused’s evidence, there was ‘some dispute’ with respect to the transaction between Jay and Jonathan[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13). This further supports the account given by Jay. However, I rejected the accused’s evidence that Amos left him to go up to the carpark to attend to the issue. The evidence of Jay was that he was liaising with Rosanna, and Rosanna was liaising with Yannie who in turn was liaising with Amos via handphone. I accepted Amos’ evidence that he was with the accused throughout until the MT103 (P10) was accepted by Jay.

283    As regards the MT103 which purportedly evidenced the transaction (P10), the accused initially claimed it was sent to him by Amos. Subsequently, he said it was sent to him by Jonathan or Amos. His evidence was also vague as to when it was sent to him. However, on his evidence he was not required to do anything with the document as he was not involved. It therefore did not make any sense for Amos or Jonathan to send P10 to the accused. I accepted Amos’ evidence that he received P10 via Telegram from the accused when he was with the accused. I accepted his evidence that he forwarded P10 to Yannie. This was supported by Yannie’s evidence. I accepted her evidence that she forwarded P10 to Rosanna. This was confirmed by Rosanna. I accepted Rosanna’s evidence that she forwarded it to Jay. I accepted Jay’s evidence that he noticed the funds were being sent by a Hongkong company and he queried Rosanna on this. I accepted Jay’s evidence that he ultimately agreed to allow Jonathan to leave because he trusted Rosanna that it was safe and he had also asked her to obtain the receipt of transfer as proof.

284    Turning now to the bag of cash. The story of the accused on the events preceding the bag of cash being passed to him was materially inconsistent and unbelievable. The position that he took when Amos was cross-examined was as follows[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14):

> Q    Alright. My instructions are that after you had brought Jay down of---to---to level 1 of the building, Sunshine Plaza, after Jay had left, you had gone to meet the accused person at the same building to have coffee with him.

> A    I disagree.

> Q    Alright. I’ll put it to you that after Jay had left, you had gone to meet the accused person at the same Sunshine Plaza building to have coffee with him.

> A    Disagree, Sir.

> Q    And after coffee, the accused person told you that he is leaving to buy 4D lottery.

> A    Disagree.

> Q    And then when the accused person told you that he’s leaving to buy 4D lottery, you told him that you needed to return back to level 3 of the car park to settle some stuff.

> A    Disagree, Sir.

The above version which was put to Amos that he met the accused after Jay left, and Amos then went up to the car park to settle ‘stuff’ (presumably with Jonathan) was materially inconsistent with the accused’s evidence. On the accused’s version when he gave evidence, Amos had received a call on some issues relating to the transaction, and he (Amos) then went up to meet ‘the money changer and his client’[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15) and he did not meet Amos thereafter. I found the accused took materially inconsistent positions because he was fabricating a story.

285    Based on the CCTV footage, Jonathan was seen coming down the carpark ramp alone at about 4.53pm. At that point, both Jay and Amos were at the carpark. At that point, Jonathan had the bag of cash. Very shortly thereafter, as seen from the footage, the accused is walking with Jonathan at the back alley of the NAFA campus and thereafter outside the provision shop where he is seen carrying the bag of cash.

286    On the evidence of the accused, both the money changer (Amos) and remittance service provider (Jonathan) somehow did not want to take possession of the cash immediately. Jonathan did not tell him why he did not pass the cash to Amos even though Amos had gone up to the car park when he (Jonathan) was about to leave with the cash and why he (Jonathan) could not hold onto it. His evidence was that Jonathan only told him there was a change in plan. Similarly, he did not receive any explanation from Amos. Yet, he was content to take possession of the bag of cash without even counting the cash. I disbelieved this incredible story. I found that Jonathan had called the accused after he received the cash. In fact, Jonathan is seen holding his handphone to his ear as he walked down the car park. I accepted Jonathan’s evidence that he called the accused because he was asked by the accused to pass the money to him after it had been counted. Consistent with the fact that the accused wanted Jonathan to pass him the money after it had been counted, the accused was still in the vicinity of Sunshine Plaza about more than one hour later to receive the cash. His evidence that Jonathan told him that there was a change in plan was a blatant lie.

287    From the footage, the accused walked with Jonathan towards the back alley of the NAFA campus where he received the bag of cash. I accepted Jonathan’s evidence that the accused gave him $1,000 for his assistance to count the money. Thereafter, the accused headed with Jonathan towards a provision shop. It is undisputed that the accused subsequently placed the white bag containing cash in a red plastic bag. Jonathan’s evidence was that he bought a bottle of water solely to obtain a plastic bag to pass to the accused at his request. I rejected the evidence of the accused that the plastic bag was passed to him because the bag containing the cash looked tattered. This was the very same bag which Jay had brought the money in. As seen in the footage, the accused was pacing in front of the shop comfortably carrying the bag by its handles. From the footage, it is apparent that the bag was not in poor condition. I accepted Jonathan’s evidence that the accused requested him to buy something to obtain a plastic bag to place the paper bag of cash in because the accused did not want the paper bag to be recognisable by anyone who had previous knowledge of it. This is not surprising as on the evidence of Jonathan the accused headed towards Sunshine Plaza after they parted ways. This is further supported by the fact that the accused boarded the Gojek private hire vehicle from Sunshine Residences at 5.18pm.

#### Did the accused meet Amos twice at Eastpoint Mall?

288    On Amos’ evidence he met the accused on 22 and 23 February 2019 at Eastpoint Mall, Simei. The accused claimed that he met Amos only on 23 February 2019 to pass him the bag of cash.

289    I accepted Amos’ evidence that he met the accused at night on 22 February 2019. He was unable to remember the time and estimated that it was around 8plus to 9plus. I found that the accused denied meeting Amos because he was simply capitalising on the mistake that Amos had made in his first information report which he had lodged in the wee hours of the morning after a failed attempt to locate the accused at his parents’ residence. Amos’ evidence is corroborated by his WhatsApp message to the accused. At 7.32pm, he asked “_Later meet where_”. The accused’s travel record shows that he boarded a Grab private hire car and arrived at Simei Street 1 at about 7pm. At about 9pm, the accused boarded a Gojek private hire car from Simei MRT station where the Eastpoint Mall is located.

290    I accepted Amos’ evidence that he met the accused at Toast Box and received from him a sum of S$4,000 plus as commission which was to be shared with Rosanna, Yannie and Eileen. Rosanna, Eileen and Yannie confirmed receipt of their share of the monies.

291    It is not in dispute that Amos met the accused on the night of 23 February 2019 at Toast Box at Eastpoint Mall. What was in dispute was the purpose of the meeting. The accused claimed that he passed the bag of cash which he received from Jonathan to Amos and called his father, Ong TL, as a witness who testified that he witnessed the alleged handing over. On the other hand, Amos testified that he met the accused to receive a goodwill bonus of $2,000 plus.

292    I found the evidence of Ong TL that he coincidentally had a short chat with the accused during which he saw the bag of cash on the floor and the chat ended with the accused saying he was rushing to pass the bag of cash to his friend to be unconvincing. On Ong TL’s evidence, he did not know the amount of cash in the bag. Yet, he claimed to be gripped with concerns of safety over what was a very short walk to the mall of less than five minutes through a well-lit public housing estate. Further, on Ong TL’s account, the accused was allegedly accustomed to bringing ‘lots of money’ back home. Accordingly, there would have been no reason for Ong TL to be concerned about or to question the accused about carrying cash as it was not unusual.

293    On Ong TL’s evidence, they left the flat at 8plus. However, the objective evidence in the form of the WhatsApp conversation of Amos squarely contradicted this claim. The WhatsApp messages show that the accused could not have reached the Toast Box until after 9.22pm because Amos was messaging the accused on his order for drink at the said time.

294    The content and shifts in Ong TL’s evidence on the date when he allegedly saw the accused handing the money also made it clear that he was a partial witness and he was not giving evidence of an event of which he had a genuine recollection. His initial evidence was that he took reference from the visit to his flat where three persons came to look for the accused which happened a few days later. In cross-examination, asked how many days before the visit he had witnessed the accused handing the money over, he tried to shield himself from answering the question by asking if he could refuse to answer it. He then went onto assert categorically that he is able to remember the exact date as 23 February on account of the amount of cash the accused was carrying. It was clear that Ong LT was desperately trying to support the accused’s account by sticking to the date of 23 February.

295    I also found Ong LT’s evidence that the accused pointed the person to whom he was going to hand the money to be contrived. On his evidence, he was walking about five steps behind the accused. Oddly, the accused would have had to wait for him to catch up when he was quite close to Toast Box to point out the person that he was going to hand the monies over to. The accused’s evidence also did not support this claim. The accused instead gave another contrived version that he turned around after he passed the money, and saw that Ong TL had seen him passing the money. It was clear that both the accused and Ong LT were desperately trying to come up with a version that Ong TL had seen the bag of cash being handed over on 23 February 2019.

296    I found Ong TL to be an unreliable witness and I rejected his and the accused’s account that a bag of cash was passed to Amos. I accepted Amos’ evidence that he met the accused sometime after 9.22pm on 23 February 2019 for the purpose of receiving a sum of $2,000 plus which the accused claimed was being given by his boss as a goodwill gesture.

#### The aftermath and accused’s conduct

297    When the money had still not been transferred to Shoji’s bank account on 25 February 2019, Amos called the accused. I accepted Amos’ evidence that the accused assured him that the money had been deducted from the company’s account and that it should arrive in a few days. The WhatsApp messages show that Amos had sent several messages to the accused between 27 February 2019 and 1 March 2019. The accused did not reply to any of the messages.

298    In the messages, Amos suggested to the accused to show the bank statement with the deduction; told the accused that he was being chased for an update and the amount is not small; made other suggestions like ‘send tracker’ and ‘send a photo showing deduction will be good’. He even tried to elicit a response by telling a white lie that his two TT from Hong Kong have reached. The accused did not reply to any of the messages. I rejected the accused’s evidence that he did not reply to Amos’ messages because he ‘played along’ with Amos’ request that he will send him ‘funny stuff’ as part of a ‘show’ to ‘cut the people out’ of the referral fee. First, this explanation was absurd as the alleged people were not privy to the WhatsApp communication. Second, Amos was in the messages alleging that the accused was responsible for the non-receipt of the remittance. I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that it “is inherently incredible that the accused would dutifully obey Amos’ instructions to remain silent and sit by while he read Amos’ messages incriminate him for the unreceived remittance.” I agreed that the assertion by the accused was ‘blatant fiction’.

299    In the aftermath of the monies not having been transferred to Shoji’s bank account, Rosanna, Yannie and Amos were desperate to locate the accused. They managed to track the accused’s home address to Simei and went to look for the accused on the night of 2 March 2019. Ong TL confirmed that three people came to his flat at night to look for the accused. When the accused could not be found at his flat, Amos lodged a police report against him at 3.14am on 3 March 2019.

300    I accepted Eileen’s evidence that the accused was amongst the people that she had gone drinking with in 2014 and 2015. Accordingly, she knew an ex-colleague of the accused who suggested to look for the accused at Sunshine Plaza. Amos then went to great lengths to track the accused at Sunshine Plaza and even roped in a friend to assist.

301    On 4 March 2019, when he finally spotted the accused in a Grab car, he tried to stop the car but was unable to. In desperation, he pulled at the door handle to stop the car but dislodged the handle in the process. Amos then got into a private hire car to pursue the accused. This showed his determination to avenge the wrong which the accused had done by disappearing with the monies. He tracked him down at a gaming shop at Orchard Gateway where he accosted the accused with another man. Jerry testified that one of the men said, ‘You still trying to run?’ and ‘Where is the money?’. This direct confrontation is strong evidence to support Amos’ account that he did not receive the money from the accused and he was instead tracking him down to recover the monies.

302    At the gaming shop, Amos showed the photograph of Jonathan to the shop owner, Jerry, in order to track down Jonathan. This supported Amos’ evidence that he did not know Jonathan. Moreover, if Jonathan was involved in the conspiracy with Amos as alleged, it would not have made sense for Amos to track down Jonathan.

303    Jerry testified that he was told that Jonathan had collected the money. After Jerry confirmed that he knew Jonathan, he was asked to call him. Jerry decided to check with the accused if Jonathan was involved before making the call. The accused told Jerry not to ask Jonathan to come down. However, Jerry went ahead and called Jonathan. The accused disputed having told Jerry that and claimed that Jerry’s recollection was unreliable. Whilst Jerry’s memory of the entire events which happened more than two years ago was understandably not perfect on the details, he readily admitted whenever he was unable to remember an event on which he was questioned. However, he was steadfast in his account that the accused had told him in Mandarin not to ask Jonathan to come down. I found Jerry’s evidence that the accused had said that to him to be reliable. I agreed with the prosecution that the irresistible inference is that the accused did not want Jonathan to come to the store to tell the truth and implicate him.

304    SSSgt Azfar questioned the accused at the scene. He asked the accused how he knew Amos and Jonathan. The accused lied and said that he did not know them. SSSgt Azfar noticed that the accused was holding his handphone and fidgeting with it. He seized it and went through its contents. After SSSgt Azfar found Amos’ contact saved in the handphone and the accused’s lie was exposed, the accused then admitted he knew Amos and Jonathan. I was satisfied that his lie was evidence of a consciousness of guilt.

305    I found there was no merit in the accused’s defence that the prosecution witnesses had conspired to cheat and were framing him. The two main witnesses, Jonathan and Amos, whom the accused dealt with did not even know each other prior to the transaction. In fact, Jonathan did not even know any of the other prosecution witnesses and Amos only knew Eileen. Sean’s evidence, which I accepted, was that the amount was eventually transferred to Shoji; by him contributing $300,000 and he received the balance of $300,000 from Jay. Jay stated that the $300,000 was contributed by himself, Rossana and Yanni. Whilst Sean contributed $300,000, his position is that Jay must ultimately reimburse him and he had obtained an IOU from Jay in this regard. It is absurd that Jay would be involved in a conspiracy to cheat himself. He did not stand to benefit from embezzling the funds as he had to make good the loss to Sean.

306    The defence made much of the fact that the cheques (P4 and P6) issued by Rosanna and Yannie were made out to one Xu Wei Wei whose identity was not established or called as a witness. I did not find this to cast any doubt. Rosanna and Yannie testified that they were given the name of the payee by Jay. Yannie gave convincing evidence as to how she reluctantly made the payment which was insisted by Jay. The following evidence by her had a clear impress of truth[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16):

> A    I cannot really remember the date. So, um, that’s why it was like a long discussion. Uh, because since Amos he don’t want to pay, be responsible for this, uh, of course, me and Rosanna also, um, didn’t feel like having to be, uh, responsible for this as in we---we also didn’t really want to pay this amount of money because it’s a huge amount of money.

> Q    Yes.

> A    So, uh, there was a lot of, uh, push back. So, we say no then the person, uh, before Rosanna say oh, we need to pay back, so there was a lot of this sort of thing going on. And that’s why ultimately, uh, we decided to pay, um, a part of it so just to hope all this thing, uh, will be settled and solved.

> Q    Okay. You said this person before Rosanna, you had met up with him, do you have a name, do you know his name?

> A    Um, I know him as Jay.

307    In conclusion, I had fully considered the defence’s submission and the material evidence although all the points may not have been fully addressed. I found that Jay, Rosanna and Yannie had satisfactorily explained the inconsistencies in their prior statements. With respect to the non-availability of the messages of Rosanna, Yannie and Eileen, I did not find anything to turn on it. As regards Amos’ messages with Yannie and Eileen, SSSgt Azfar confirmed that he did not ask Amos to produce the messages in the course of investigations.

308    I was satisfied that it was proven beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had cheated by practicing a deception that he would carry out the currency exchange and remittance transaction and thereby induced the delivery of $596,050 to himself.

#### Purchase of Patek Philippe watch and payment of credit card bill

309    On 18 February 2019, the accused enquired about the price of the Patek Philippe watch from Chrono95. On 22 February 2019 at 1.29pm, he asked again about the watch. By this time, it had been confirmed that the transaction was going ahead on the same day. At 2.45pm, he enquired about the operating hours of the shop. At 3.10pm, he said that he would try to drop in by today. I agreed with the submission of the prosecution at \[81\]:

> Crucially, these conversations with Chrono95 on 22 February 2019 took place at the same time the accused was arranging for the monies to be handed over at Sunshine Plaza, with the message at 3.10pm sent after the handover had been confirmed. It shows that the accused, while orchestrating his fraud, was already planning what he would do with the proceeds.

310    At 5.18pm, when the money was with the accused, he took a Gojek private hire car to Far East Shopping Centre. He went to Chrono95 and purchased the Patek Philippe watch for $345,000. He paid for the purchase in cash. At 6.04pm, he went to OCBC ION branch, where he paid S$63,000 towards his credit card bill in cash.

311    It did not make sense for the accused to loiter around for about one and a half hours at Sunshine Plaza with $450,000 cash on him which he allegedly brought from home. It also did not make sense that he would agree to shoulder the responsibility of carrying an additional sum of close to $600,000 without verifying the amount. If he indeed had the cash at home, he would have had ample time to proceed from home to Chrono95 to make the purchase and pay the credit card bill before making his way to Sunshine Plaza at about 3.30pm. I found that he did not do so because he did not have $450,000 at home.

312    I rejected the evidence of the accused that he amassed cash through buying and selling watches and he had about $460,000 to $500,000 in cash at his parents flat but was left with between $10,000 to $20,000 in cash after he splurged on the watch, paid his bills, bought trading cards, et cetera. I found it unbelievable that he coincidentally dissipated practically all his stash of cash savings. I found that there was no truth in the accused’s evidence and he simply gave a random figure of his alleged cash savings at home.

313    Next, there was no evidence of any steady income that the accused received from May 2018 onwards. As regards his alleged source of funds, the accused pointed to a deposit of $378,00 on 11 May 2016 and a withdrawal of $168,00 on the same day and another withdrawal of $209,000 on 28 May 2016. He also claimed to have earned from trading in watches and cards. The accused only provided 12 invoices for the purchase of watches and six invoices for the sale of watches between 2015 and 2017. He said he stopped trading in 2018 “for a while”. He provided no documentary evidence of any sale or purchase of watches in 2018.

314    The accused’s 2018 Notice of Assessment disclosed an income of S$98,391 and his 2019 Notice of Assessment disclosed an income of S$25,877. His RHB Bank Berhad statement showed he had less than $10 from mid-June 2018 onwards. Prior to that, there was a $121,500 deposit on 7 March 2018 and a sum of $120,000 was withdrawn the next day. The accused’s UOB and POSB banks accounts at the material time were effectively empty. He had less than $120 in his DBS account as of 22nd February 2019. By the end of December 2018, he had gone over his credit limit of $60,000 with a balance of S$61,087.36, increasing to S$62,583.14 by the end of January 2019.

315    The accused claimed to receive an income from his family’s rental business but there was no evidence to substantiate this claim. The fact that the accused was under financial pressure is apparent from his persistence in asking Jonathan to help him secure a job from around 7 January 2019 to 19 February 2019 as evidenced by the messages in P12 and his messages to Amos asking for opportunities.

316    In the invoice P7, he did not write his full name but used the Chinese character ‘Wang’. It is significant that he had not used the character ‘Wang’ in the invoices which he tendered for purchases between 2015 and 2017 and had provided his own handphone number in those invoices. For the purchase in question, he provided his wife’s handphone number. The fact that he deliberately did not provide his handphone number is seen from his query to the shop two days later (24 February 2022) if there were any messages sent to the number he registered. The irresistible inference is that he was trying to avoid being identified as the actual purchaser.

317    I found the lack of any real income presented a clear motive. I found it was not sheer coincidence that the accused bought the watch and paid the credit card bill on the same day shortly after he came into possession of the funds in question. I found that the accused made the purchase of the Patek Philippe watch totaling $345,000 and paid his outstanding credit card bill to the tune of $63,000 with the monies derived from his criminal conduct.

318    I found that the two CDSA charges were established beyond a reasonable doubt and the accused was accordingly found guilty and convicted.

## Mitigation

319    The accused is 33 years of age. He is a first offender. The performance awards which he received when he was in the banking sector were tendered.

320    As regards the cheating charge, a sentence of 40 months’ imprisonment was sought. For the CDSA charges, the defence sought a sentence of 13 months imprisonment for the charge involving $345,000 and six months’ imprisonment for the charge involving $63,000.

## Sentence

#### Section 420 charge

321    Section 420 Penal Code prescribes mandatory imprisonment up to 10 years.

322    The total amount of $596,050 cheated was substantial. Whilst there is no arithmetical relationship between the sentence and the amount, the higher the amount cheated, generally the more severe the sentence that is imposed. The accused did not make any restitution. His culpability was high. He perpetrated a carefully planned cunning ruse. He made use of a fake document P9 to support his ploy that the transaction could be done safely through him in order to lay his hands on the monies. He then made use of another fake document P10 which stated the money had been transferred to Shoji to complete the deception. In order to keep a distance and to deny involvement, he roped in his friend, Jonathan, to count and receive the monies and falsely claimed that Jonathan was providing a money remittance service. The accused put up a wholly lying defence that he was being framed and did not show an iota of remorse.

323    The prosecution cited four precedents. However, as the offenders in two of the cases had similar antecedents, I will only refer to two of the cases where the offenders did not have any criminal record. In _Public Prosecutor v Cao Shengliang_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 160</span>, the offender was convicted after a trial of three s 420 charges. He paid for diamonds using cheques which he knew would be dishonoured, thereby inducing the victims to deliver to him jewellery with a total value of $211,390. He made restitution of $33,400. He was sentenced to a total term of 34 months’ imprisonment. In _Public Prosecutor v Neo Aileen_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGDC 315</span>, the offender pleaded guilty to two charges under s 420 of deceiving a close friend into believing that she could get better exchange rates for him, and thereby got him to deliver two cheques for USD 500,000 each to her (USD 1,000,000). The offender in turn handed dud cheques for the exchanged amount in SGD, and absconded with the money. No restitution was made. She was sentenced to a total term of 78 months’ imprisonment.

324    Taking reference from these cases, and having regard to the culpability of the accused, I agreed with the prosecution’s submission for a sentence of 54 months’ imprisonment to be appropriate.

#### The CDSA charges

325    The prescribed punishment under section 47(6)(a) is an imprisonment term which may extend to 10 years or a fine not exceeding $500,000 or both.

326    The defence relied on _Public Prosecutor v Ho Man Yuk and others_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 23</span>, a decision of the district court which set out sentencing ranges in a plead guilty case involving ‘self-laundering’ where the offenders had actual knowledge of tainted funds and where the amount is recovered, as 5 to 9 months’ imprisonment for amounts of $40,000 to less than $100,000, 10 to 11 months’ imprisonment for amounts of $100,000 to less than $300,000 and 12 to 13 months’ imprisonment for amounts from $300,000 to $500,000.

327    The prosecution referred to two cases. First, the case of _Chong Kum Heng v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 4 SLR 1056</span> where the offender was convicted after a trial of one count of criminal breach of trust of the proceeds of sale of excess copper cables totalling $214,000 and six CDSA charges with amounts ranging between $9,000 to $40,000. For the CDSA charge involving $40,000, he was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment. Second, the case of _Lim Seng Soon v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 1 SLR 1195</span>, where the offender was a relationship manager. He pleaded guilty to cheating a client of $2 million and five CDSA charges where the amounts ranged between $150,000 to $478,000. There were also similar charges TICed. He made full restitution. For the CDSA charge involving a sum of $478,000 he was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment. For the charge involving $352,000, he was sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment.

328    These precedents provided guidance to a certain extent, but they are of course broad reference points. Here, the money which was the subject-matter of the CDSA charges represented the benefits of the antecedent offence of cheating. The amount involved is a principal consideration in determining seriousness. However, the use to which the monies were put is equally relevant. The accused was motivated by avarice to purchase an expensive luxury watch. He wrote his name using a single Chinese character on the invoice and did not provide his own phone number. He claimed he wrote his wife’s phone number. In mitigation, it was revealed that his wife is in China and she has been living apart since August 2018 after the expiry of her long term social visit pass. It is plain that the accused took steps not to disclose his true identity. As regards the other CDSA charge, he made use of the criminal proceeds to pay his credit card bill totalling a significant sum of $63,000. Accordingly, I agreed with the prosecution’s calibration of a sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment and eight months’ imprisonment respectively. In comparison with _Chong Kim Heng_, which was a less aggravated case, and where a sentence of six months’ imprisonment was imposed for the sum of $40,000, the sentence of eight months’ imprisonment cannot be said to be disproportionate for the sum of $63,000.

329    The sentence of eight months’ imprisonment and the 54-month term were ordered to run consecutively, making a total of 62 months’ imprisonment. In my view, the total sentence was just and proportionate and did not require any downward adjustment of the individual sentences.
