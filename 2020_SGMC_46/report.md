### District Judge John Ng:

## Introduction

1       The Accused is Sulaiman Bin Mohd Hassan, a male 52-year-old Singapore citizen. He was convicted after a trial on two charges – for an offence of using a chauffeured private hire car as a taxi, which is not in accordance with the vehicle licence issued under the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) (“RTA”) and a connected offence under the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189, 2000 Rev Ed) (“MVA”) for not having the insurance policy covering the use of that vehicle as a taxi.

2       A sentence of $1,700 total fine – $1,000 for the RTA offence and $700 for the MVA offence – was passed. As required under Section 3(3) of the MVA, an order of disqualification from holding or obtaining a driving licence for a period of 12 months was imposed.

3       The Accused has filed an appeal against the convictions and the sentence, including the disqualification. A stay on the execution of the order of disqualification has been granted pending the appeal. The fines have been paid to the Land Transport Authority (“LTA”).

## The Charges

4       The two charges preferred against the Accused were:

> **LTA000026-2019-1**

> You, SULAIMAN BIN MOHD HASSAN, Male / 52 years old, are charged that you, on 2 February 2018 at about 1:53 am, at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel Tower 1 driveway, did use a chauffeured private hire car, _namely_, a Toyota Alphard bearing registration number SDV9333S (“the vehicle”), as a public service vehicle, _namely_, a taxi, otherwise than in accordance with the licence issued under Part V of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) (“RTA”) for the vehicle, _to wit_, there was only a valid licence authorising the use of the vehicle as a chauffeured private hire car, and not as a taxi, in contravention of section 101(1) of the RTA, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 101(2) of the RTA.

> **LTA000026-2019-2**

> You, SULAIMAN BIN MOHD HASSAN, Male / 52 years old, are charged that you, on 2 February 2018 at about 1:53 am, did use a motor vehicle in Singapore, _namely_, a Toyota Alphard bearing registration number SDV9333S (“the vehicle”), _to wit_, you used the vehicle as a taxi, by carrying passengers from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel Tower 1 driveway to the Four Seasons Hotel Singapore, whilst there was not in force in relation to the said use of the vehicle, such a policy of insurance in respect of third-party risks as complies with the requirements of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189, 2000 Rev Ed) (“MVA”), and you have thereby contravened section 3(1)(a) of the MVA, which contravention is punishable under section 3(2) read with section 3(3) of the MVA.

## Undisputed Facts

5       An Agreed Statement of Facts was submitted jointly by the Prosecution and the Defence at the start of the trial. The Agreed Statement of Facts contained the following undisputed facts.

6       On 2 February 2018, at about 1.53 a.m., Ms Gabrielova Petra (“PW1”) and her three friends were walking along the driveway at Marina Bay Sands (“MBS”) Hotel Tower 1, towards the taxi stand. They approached the Accused who was in the vehicle SDV9333S, at the waiting/pick-up area. PW1 and the Accused had a brief discussion, during which both agreed that the Accused would convey PW1 and her friends from MBS to the Four Seasons Hotel Singapore.

7       PW1 and her three friends boarded the vehicle SDV9333S and the Accused drove them to the Four Seasons Hotel. Upon arrival, PW1 paid a sum of money to the Accused as the fare for the ride. The Accused did not issue a receipt. The trip was not booked through the GRAB App. There was no prior agreement (before they met at the MBS waiting/pick-up area) for the Accused to drive PW1 and her friends from MBS to the Four Seasons Hotel.

8       The Accused had on 20 October 2016 entered into a 2-year Vehicle Limousine Chauffeur Contract (Exhibit P1) with Section Limousine Services Private Limited (“SLS”), a limousine services company, and was provided with a Toyota Alphard car bearing registration number SDV9333S (“the Vehicle”) to carry out private limousine services.

9       The Vehicle was licensed under the RTA to be used as a chauffeured private hire car. The Vehicle did not have a public service vehicle licence which permitted it to be used as a taxi.

10     The Vehicle Limousine Chauffeur Contract specifically provided at Clause 5 that “The Chauffeur shall be engaged exclusively to provide his services to drive the Vehicle as a private limousine and shall not use the Vehicle for any unlawful purposes and to engage in any taxi services. …”

## Prosecution’s Case

11     The DPP proceeded on the basis that private hire cars are motor cars that do not ply for hire on any road while taxis are motor cars which ply for hire on any road. The DPP referred to the Second Schedule to the RTA for the definitions of the two different classifications of public service vehicles under the RTA and relied on these classifications to frame the issues in this case. The difference between a private hire car and a taxi is therefore that the latter may ply for hire on roads but not the former.

12     The DPP submitted, based on the agreed facts and the evidence adduced at trial, that the Accused was “plying for hire” when he picked up PW1 and her friends at the waiting/pick-up area of MBS and conveyed them to the Four Seasons Hotel.

13     The DPP acknowledged that there was no statutory definition of “plying for hire” and relied on English cases for the proposition that the essence of “plying for hire” is that the vehicle should be in the view of the public, the driver should impliedly invite the public to use it and a member of the public should be able to use the vehicle if he wanted to.

14     Based on the aforesaid proposition, the DPP submitted that the Accused was obviously plying for hire in view of the following:

> (a)     His vehicle was parked prominently in the waiting/pick-up area of a hotel in clear view of the public.

> (b)     From the location where the Accused was waiting, the implication was that members of the public could enter the Vehicle and ride it if they wanted to. This was certainly the impression that PW1 had before approaching the Vehicle and asking the Accused about a ride to the Four Seasons Hotel.

> (c)     The Vehicle was immediately available for use by members of the public. PW1 told the Accused her destination, they agreed on a price and she and her friends were conveyed to the destination, without any prior booking.

15     The DPP submitted that when the Accused picked up PW1 and her friends from the waiting/pick-up area of MBS and conveyed them to their destination without a prior booking, he had used the Vehicle as a taxi. The Vehicle was not licensed to be used as a taxi and such use on that day was accordingly in contravention of the public service vehicle licence issued for the Vehicle to be used as a chauffeured private hire car.

16     As for the charge under the MVA for using the Vehicle when it was not covered by the required policy of insurance in respect of third-party risks, it was based on the use of the vehicle as a taxi and this is specifically excluded in the contract of insurance (exhibit P2) with the insurers – Tokio Marine Insurance Singapore Ltd (“TMI”).

## Defence’s case

17     The Defence’s position against the charges was that the Accused had not plied for hire on the road. This was based on the fact that there had been an agreement reached prior to PW1 and her friends entering the Vehicle (see Paragraph 5.1 of Defence’s Closing Submissions) and this agreement indicated that the Accused had operated the Vehicle as a private hire vehicle at the material time and not as a taxi.

18     The Defence Counsel cited the same English case authorities as the DPP on the meaning of “plying for hire” and shared the same submissions of the Prosecution that “plying for hire” means that the vehicle must be exhibited or on view to the public to be available for hire and must expressly or impliedly solicit custom in the sense of inviting the public to use the vehicle.

19     The Defence Counsel further submitted that the assessment of whether a vehicle had plied for hire must consider the characteristics of a taxi and a private hire car in terms of their appearance and behaviour.

20     The Defence adopted a 2-stage test established by the cited English cases and applied it to the present case. It was submitted that the Accused had not plied for hire as the Vehicle was not on view to the public to be for hire and the Accused did not expressly or impliedly solicit custom in the sense of inviting the public to use the Vehicle. The Defence referred to the case of _PP v Loh Kum San_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 79</span> for an example where there were clear taxi-like characteristics portrayed.

## Issues

21     Based on the respective closing submissions of the Prosecution and the Defence, the relevant issues raised for resolution in this case are:

> (a)     Whether the evidence adduced in the trial proved that the Accused had used the chauffeured private hire car as a taxi.

> (b)     What is the meaning of “plying for hire”?

> (c)     Whether the Accused was “plying for hire” when he picked up PW1 and her friends at the waiting/pick-up area of MBS and conveyed them to the Four Seasons Hotel.

> (d)     Whether there was the required insurance policy in respect of third-party risks for the vehicular trip to the Four Seasons Hotel after the Accused had picked up the passengers at MBS.

22     These were the material issues, the resolution of which would determine the guilt or otherwise of the Accused in respect of both the charges he was facing. There were other issues raised but these other issues would only be dealt with or discussed if they were relevant to the verdict.

## Findings

23     The findings of any trial court must necessarily depend on the issues raised in the trial. The findings of a trial court must also be appreciated in context. The context depends very much on how the evidence was adduced and how the respective cases were presented.

24     In the present proceedings, the key issue placed before the court was whether the Accused was “plying for hire” when he was waiting at the MBS waiting/pick up area on 2 February 2018 and subsequently picking up a group of passengers who had approached him.

25     Part V of the RTA contains the provisions governing Public Service Vehicles. Section 100(1) of the RTA states that the classification and descriptions of “public service vehicles” for the purpose the Act and the rules shall be as set out in the Second Schedule “Classification and descriptions of public service vehicles” of the RTA. The First column under “Class of Public Service Vehicles” listed “Private hire cars” under item (e) and “Taxis” under item (g). The Second column provides the “Description” for each type of public service vehicles.

26     What was relevant in this case was the distinction being drawn between private hire cars and taxis of which the material difference, for the purpose of this trial, was that “Private hire cars” do not ply for hire on any road and “Taxis” are motor cars which ply for hire on any road. Both the Prosecution and the Defence had relied on the cited English cases for their understanding of the phrase “plying for hire” as there was no legal definition for that phrase in the RTA. Before we consider the meaning of the phrase “plying for hire”, we need to establish the factual matrix in this case.

27     What were my findings on what had transpired on 2 February 2018?

28     I accepted the evidence of PW1 on how she and her three friends had come to board the Vehicle driven by the Accused. Her evidence was broadly in line with the Agreed Statement of Facts and the CCTV footages tendered in evidence. She did not see any taxi at the taxi stand and approached the Vehicle waiting at the waiting/pick up area.

29     PW1 asked the driver _i.e._ the Accused, if he could bring her and her friends to the Four Seasons Hotel. The Accused said he could bring them to their destination, and both of them agreed on the price of $50. They boarded the Vehicle and were conveyed to the Four Seasons Hotel. When they reached the destination, she paid him $50 together with a $10 tip.

30     PW1’s testimony was materially unchallenged under Cross-examination by the Defence Counsel. Instead, the Defence specifically confirmed with PW1 that there was an agreement of price and destination between PW1 and the Accused prior to the boarding of the Vehicle by PW1 and her three friends.

31     As for PW2 and PW3, their testimonies were largely uncontroversial. PW2 was a representative of the insurer TMI. He testified that the insurance policy which was taken out for the Vehicle by the registered owner SLS were specifically for private hire services and excluded the use of the Vehicle for taxi services. PW2 referred to Endorsement B of the Certificate of Insurance (Exhibit P3) which states: “RENTAL FOR USE AS TAXI SERVICE IS NOT COVERED BY THE POLICY” and explained that it meant the insurance policy did not cover the situation where the vehicle is being used as a taxi. PW2 confirmed that TMI would reject a claim arising from the use of the Vehicle to convey passengers without prior booking.

32     In the Cross-examination of PW2, the witness explained that the insurer TMI will reject a claim from the use of the Vehicle as a taxi, as that would be a breach of the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. However, if the law under the MVA compels the insurer to pay any third-party for injuries suffered, TMI would pay and recover the payment from the insured. PW2 disagreed with the Defence Counsel’s suggestion that in such a scenario, the third-party is covered by the insurance policy. The fact that the law may compel the insurer to pay the third-party who suffered bodily injuries did not mean that the third-party was covered by the insurance policy. There was still no insurance coverage taken up by the insured against third-party risks.

33     PW2 was also asked by the Defence Counsel on his understanding of the phrase “plying for hire”. The DPP objected to this line of questioning as the witness’ understanding has no bearing on the case. The Defence Counsel accepted the Prosecution’s point and concluded her cross-examination of PW2.

34     PW3 was a representative of SLS, the registered owner of the Vehicle. She testified that SLS had an agreement with the Accused to provide chauffeur services using the Vehicle as a private limousine. The Accused was to drive the Vehicle for assignments with advanced bookings and not to engage in taxi services.

35     The Accused elected to testify after he was called upon to enter his Defence. He testified that on 2 February 2018, he had received an Uber booking and he drove to MBS. He was waiting at the pick-up area for about 10 to 15 minutes when the Uber booking was cancelled. He decided to wait for 3 to 5 minutes to see if there might be another booking.

36     While waiting, a lady _i.e._ PW1, approached the Vehicle and spoke to the Accused. According to the Accused, PW1 said she wanted to go to the Four Seasons Hotel, but he told her that she had to make a booking via Grab or Uber because he could only take bookings. However, PW1 and her friends persisted and just went into his car. The Accused claimed that he did not discuss the price of the fare with them as they were drunk. He just drove them to the Four Seasons Hotel and they only gave him $15 at the end of the trip.

37     When cross-examined by the DPP, the Accused agreed that as a private hire car, he was not supposed to pick up passengers at the hotel without an Uber or Grab booking. The following exchange with the DPP was highly pertinent:

> “Q:    Okay. As a Grab driver, you would know that you are not supposed to pick passengers at the pick-up point of hotels without booking. You know?

> A:    Yah, I know. You see, ah, I’m doing this line for about 6 years. And I never do any side orders, that means, uh, on the side of the road pick up people and do some touting. I never do that.

> Q:    Okay.

> A:    Because I know it’s very illegal.

> Q:    It is very illegal.

> A:    E---e---yes.

> Q:    Because that one is behaving like a taxi.

> A:    Yes, correct.

> Q:    I mean only taxis can pick-up on a pick-up points and taxi stand.

> A:    Yes, I understand.

> Q:    Private hire car cannot.

> A:    Yes, correct.”

(NE Day 1 on 22 January 2020 – from Page 69 at 31 to Page 70 at 16)

38     The aforesaid questions by the DPP and the answers given by the Accused showed beyond doubt that the Accused was fully aware that he was not to pick up passengers without a booking and to do so would be akin to the behaviour of a taxi. This understanding put paid to the Defence being run by the Defence Counsel that if there was an agreement as to price and destination between a driver and the passenger before boarding the vehicle, the vehicle was not being used as a taxi but as a private hire car.

39     In the course of the Cross-examination of the Accused, the DPP proceeded to impeach the credibility of the Accused with his previous statement. The DPP showed the Accused the statement he had given to the LTA investigator on 1 March 2018 and pointed out several inconsistencies in that statement and his evidence in court. The Accused was not able to give any satisfactory answers for the inconsistencies.

40     I found the Accused to be unworthy of credit as a witness for the following reasons. The Accused was impeached by the DPP based on the previous inconsistent statement that he had given to the LTA investigator on 1 March 2018. There were material inconsistencies as follows:

> (a)     In court, the Accused’s position was that he had agreed the price and destination with PW1 before taking them on board the Vehicle for the journey to Four Seasons Hotel. In his statement, the Accused said that he had not agreed any price for the fare.

> (b)     In the statement, the Accused said that he had to move off with the passengers because there were a lot of vehicles honking behind his vehicle. In Court, he testified that there were no cars behind his car. The CCTV footages showed that there were no vehicles behind the Accused when he drove off with the four passengers. In his statement to the LTA investigator, the Accused was trying to give excuses for picking up the passengers without a booking. This led to him trying to say that he was under pressure to move off with the passengers in his car due to the honking of vehicles behind.

> (c)     The Accused was also at pains to state in his statement that he had told PW1 and her friends that they needed to have a booking to take his vehicle but that they were very persistent for him to convey them to their destination. He also alleged that they were drunk and were quarrelling amongst themselves, leaving him no choice.

41     In his statement to the LTA, the Accused was obviously trying to deny that he had entered into an agreement with PW1 on that day without prior booking, by giving excuses as to how he had to convey the passengers to the Four Seasons Hotel under pressure.

42     There is no dispute that the Accused had conveyed the four passengers from MBS to the Four Seasons Hotel in the early hours of 2 February 2018. The evidence pointed clearly to the Accused picking up the passengers PW1 and her three friends without any prior booking for a limousine service. The Accused had agreed there and then to convey the four passengers to the Four Seasons Hotel after agreeing on the price and destination with PW1 before the start of the journey.

43     This case is not about the Accused driving the Vehicle on the roads looking for customers or passengers, which is what the phrase “plying for hire” would ordinarily imply. The phrase must be seen in the light of the demarcation of private hire cars and taxis in Singapore, and what the drivers of each type of public service vehicles can and cannot do to take in passengers.

44     Based on the facts found in this case, I accept the submissions of the DPP that the Vehicle driven by the Accused was parked prominently in the waiting/pick-up area of the hotel MBS, in full view of members of the public. It is reasonable to imply by the location where the Accused was waiting with his car that members of the public would form the impression that the Vehicle was for hire, as PW1 did. More specifically, it led to PW1 approaching the Accused in his car and asking to be sent to the Four Seasons Hotel. Significantly, the Accused did not disabuse PW1 of the idea that his car was for hire. Instead he entered into an agreement with PW1 on the spot, for the Accused to convey PW1 and her friends to their destination for a fare of $50.

45     On the aforesaid point, an observation made by the court (at ¶38 of the judgment) in _Reading Borough Council v Ali_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 WLR 2635</span> is instructive. One of the reasons given for the acquittal in that case was that if a member of the public had approached the vehicle and sought a ride, the defendant would have refused to take such a passenger off the street without a prior booking through the Uber app. On the facts of the present case, the Accused did not refuse to take the passengers but confirmed PW1’s impression that the Vehicle was for hire by agreeing to take them for the agreed price of $50.

46     The Prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused, by waiting at the pick-up area of MBS and agreeing to and conveying the four passengers to Four Seasons Hotel for a price of $50 without prior booking, had used the Vehicle as a taxi and was in contravention of the public service licence issued for that Vehicle to be used as a chauffeured private hire car.

47     Consequently, by using the Vehicle as a taxi, there was no insurance coverage for the Vehicle in respect of third-party risks. I was unable to accept the arguments put up by the Defence Counsel that even if the Vehicle was used as a taxi, it was still covered by the insurance policy issued by TMI. The Prosecution had amply shown by its Reply Submissions to the Defence’s Closing Submissions that there was no merit in the arguments canvassed by the Defence Counsel. I do not intend to repeat the points put forth by the DPP showing that the Defence was misconceived in their arguments against the MVA charge.

## Antecedent

48     The Accused did not have any criminal record.

## Submissions on sentence

### Prosecution’s submissions

49     The Prosecution tendered a table of sentencing precedents for both the RTA offence and the MVA offence. The DPP was not pressing for a custodial sentence even though deterrence is the operative sentencing principle in this case. The DPP highlighted that the range of fines imposed for cases, where accused persons had pleaded guilty, was $900 to $1,000 for the RTA offence and $600 for the MVA offence.

50     The Prosecution suggested a total sentence of $1,800. The DPP proposed the fines of $1,100 for the RTA offence and $700 for the MVA offence, being a slight uplift from the usual fines for uncontested cases.

### Mitigation plea

51     The Defence Counsel sought for a fine of not more than $500 for the RTA offence and $300 for the MVA offence. The Defence Counsel submitted that the Accused was a first offender. He was the sole breadwinner of his family. The Defence Counsel also submitted that the Accused had cooperated with the authorities and understood that he had transgressed the law. He is deeply remorseful and will not repeat such a mistake in the future.

## Sentence

### The RTA Offence

52     A non-custodial sentence in the form of a fine would be a sufficient sentence on the RTA conviction for the Accused who was a first offender. A fine of $1,000 would be in line with the sentencing precedents and might even be on the lenient side since the Accused had contested the charge.

### The MVA Offence

53     For the Section 3(2) MVA conviction, a fine of $700 was imposed as the Accused had not only claimed trial to this charge but had put forth unmeritorious arguments during the trial against this charge. A higher fine was not imposed as I had taken into account the mitigating factors presented by his counsel. He was a first offender, he had health issues and he was the sole breadwinner. I disregarded his claim of being remorseful as he had shown himself untruthful during the trial, in his attempt to avoid the legal consequences of his wrongful act.

54     It was mandatory for the Court under Section 3(3) of the MVA for the conviction under Section 3(2) MVA to impose a disqualification of at least 12 months unless there were special reasons.

### No Special Reasons

55     The meaning of “special reasons” was considered by the High Court in the cases of _Muhammad Faizal bin Rahim v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 116</span> and _Prathib s/o M Balan v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1066</span>. The High Court held that the phrase “special reasons” has a narrow meaning. Only reasons connected to the offence and not reasons related to the offender are to be considered.

56     The basis for adopting the narrow meaning is the underlying policy intent of the MVA which aims to prevent road users and their dependants from being left with no compensation in the event of damage or injuries sustained in a road traffic accident caused by an uninsured driver or vehicle.

57     In the present case, the Defence submitted as a special reason the fact that it was PW1 who had approached the Vehicle seeking for a ride. It was not explained or elaborated upon in the Mitigation Plea why such a fact would qualify to be a special reason. I did not see how this factor would fall within the meaning and ambit of “special reasons” under the MVA for the purpose of avoiding the imposition of the 12-month disqualification from holding or obtaining a driving licence.

## Conclusion

58     The Accused knew full well that he was not supposed to use the Vehicle to pick up passengers at the hotel waiting/pick-up area without a prior booking. Now that he has been caught through the rather unusual circumstance of PW1 having left her expensive jacket behind in the Vehicle, the Accused is attempting to escape the consequence of losing his driving licence as a result of the 12-month Disqualification. This case illustrated the difficulty of detecting such contraventions of the RTA and MVA. If not for the jacket, the offences would not have been discovered.
