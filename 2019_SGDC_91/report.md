## Statement of Facts

3       The accused admitted to the following statement of facts without qualification -

“PP V SEAH KIM HOCK

STATEMENT OF FACTS

(Incorporating 2 charges)

1    The victim is Ho Thiam Teng, Michael, Male, 44 years old, Singaporean. He is the owner of Lai Yi Wan Minced Pork Noodle Stall located at No. 84 Marine Parade Central, #01-182, Singapore (“Lai Yi Wan”). At the material time, he was 42 years old.

2    The accused is Seah Kim Hock, Male, 38 years old, Singaporean bearing NRIC No. XXX (date of birth: 22 October 1980). At the material time, he was 36 years old and was employed by the victim as a hawker assistant at Lai Yi Wan.

FIRST INFORMATION REPORT

3    On 29 November 2016, at about 3.10 p.m., the victim went to Marine Parade Neighbourhood Police Post and reported a case of theft by the accused on two separate occasions. The incident location was given as Lai Yi Wan.

FACTS RELATING TO THE 1ST CHARGE

4    On 20 November 2016, the victim received a text message from the accused stating that the accused took monies from the stall’s earnings on 16 and 17 November 2016 earnings. The victim told the accused that he was not allowed to take the said monies from the stall’s earnings. However, on the same day, the victim went to check at the earnings at the stall and discovered cash amounting to about S$800/- missing from the total earnings.

5    Investigations revealed that the accused admitted to taking the said S$700 in cash from the stall’s earnings sometime on 16 November to 20 November 2016, he also admitted to taking S$80 because he deemed it as his salary for two days.

6    The accused had, while being employed in the capacity of a servant, to wit, a hawker assistant, did dishonestly removed cash amounting to S$700 sometime on 16 November to 20 November 2016, from the possession of the victim, who was his employer. By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence of theft as a servant under s 381 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”).

FACTS RELATING TO THE 2 ND CHARGE

7    On 22 November 2016, the victim realised that S$400 was missing from the stall’s earnings on 21 November 2016. He realised that the money had been taken by the accused during the accused’s shift on 21 November 2016 as the accused had left a payment voucher with his name, amount taken, and signature inside the earnings box. When the victim realised this, he immediately tried to call the accused, but to no avail.

8    The victim then sent a text message to the accused to ask him if he took the S$400. The accused replied to ask the victim to treat it as a loan. However, the victim replied to say “no” and asked him to return the money straightaway. The accused did not do so.

9    Investigations revealed that the accused admitted to taking the said S$400 in cash from the stall’s earnings sometime on 21 November 2016.

10    The accused had, while being employed in the capacity of a servant, to wit, a hawker assistant, did dishonestly removed cash amounting to S$400 sometime on 21 November 2016, from the possession of the victim, who was his employer. By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence of theft as a servant under s 381 of the Penal Code.

CONCLUSION

11    The accused was subsequently arrested on 14 June 2017 through a Police Gazette. He had spent all the stolen monies and no restitution has been made to the victim.”

## Prescribed punishment

4       A charge under s. 381 of the Penal Code is punishable as follows –

**Theft by clerk or servant of property in possession of master**

**381**.    Whoever, being a clerk or servant, or being employed in the capacity of a clerk or servant, commits theft in respect of any property in the possession of his master or employer, _shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years, and shall also be liable to fine._

## Antecedents

5       The accused had previous antecedents. He was sentenced to 1-month imprisonment in 2002 for theft under s. 379 of the Penal Code. In 2005, he was also sentenced to 21 months’ imprisonment for the offence of theft in dwelling under s. 380 of the Penal Code.

## Prosecution submissions

6       The Prosecution submitted for a sentence of 5 weeks’ imprisonment and for a compensation order of $1100 to be paid by the accused to the victim. The Prosecution noted that the accused had related property antecedents in 2002 and again in 2005.

7       The Prosecution also cited a case precedent of _PP v Khamari Bin Khamin_. Here the accused had been convicted of a single s. 381 Penal Code charge and sentenced to 5 weeks imprisonment. He also had another s. 381 Penal Code charge that was taken into consideration for sentencing (“TIC”) and also another charge under s. 5 (2) of the Protected Areas and Protected Places Act that was also TIC.

## Mitigation

8       The accused indicated he had “_nothing to say._” When again asked by the Court and also the Interpreter to state his mitigation, he kept repeating “_Whatever, whatever._”

## Sentencing considerations

9       The accused had originally claimed trial to both charges. On the first day of trial, he decided to plead guilty to both proceeded charges. The Prosecution had submitted for a sentence of 5 weeks’ imprisonment for both proceeded charges based on the accused’s antecedents and the cited precedent of _PP v Khamari bin Khamin_. The global sentence sought was also 5 weeks’ imprisonment.

10     I noted that the accused had nothing to say in mitigation. He also came across as being unremorseful for his actions. At the same time, I was mindful that the accused was unrepresented. In any case, I did not think that the Prosecution was being excessive in their submission for a 5 weeks’ imprisonment term for the accused. In the premises, I was of the firm view that this was a fair and appropriate sentence, especially having regard to the accused’s antecedents and the precedent cited by the Prosecution.

## Payment of Compensation

11     The Prosecution had also submitted for compensation to be paid by the accused.

12     Under s 359(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, the Court is required to consider whether or not to make a compensation order against an accused in favour of a victim who was injured in respect of his person, character or property. Section 359(1) of the CPC states:

**_Order for payment of compensation_**

_359.—(1_)     _The court before which a person is convicted of any offence shall, after the conviction, consider whether or not to make an order for the payment by that person of a sum to be fixed by the court by way of compensation to the person injured, or his representative, in respect of his person, character or property by —_

(_a_)     _the offence or offences for which the sentence is passed; and_

(_b_)     _any offence that has been taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing only._

(_2_)     _If the court is of the view that it is appropriate to make such an order referred to in subsection (1), it must do so._

13     The underlying purpose and rationale of a compensation order has been clearly enunciated in the case of  _Soh Meiyun v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 3 SLR 299</span> (“_Soh Meiyun_”), Chao JA had stated at paragraph \[ 56\] that “_compensation orders are meant solely to provide redress to the victim and are not intended to punish the offender”_. I also noted that in _PP v Donohue Enilia_  <span class="citation">\[2005\] 1 SLR(R) 220</span> (“_Donohue Enilia_”), it was held that there must be a causal connection between the offence committed by the accused and the injury, loss, or damage suffered by the victim before a compensation order can be made . Such injury, loss, or damage should also be readily ascertainable and not subject to significant dispute (_Donohue Enilia_ at paragraph \[24\].

14     I had to consider whether the compensation order sought by the Prosecution was appropriate in the present case. I was aware that compensation orders are appropriate and suitable and usually ordered where the victim has grounds to commence a civil suit against the offender but faces practical difficulties such as the lack of expenses to do so – see _Soh Meiyun_ at paragraph \[56\]. However, there was no evidence before the court that that the victim in the present case was unable to commence a civil suit due to financial lack.

15     Nevertheless, on the facts of the present case, I was satisfied that the making of a compensation order was appropriate. I was mindful that the total sum of $1100/ involved was such that it would not have been entirely feasible or viable for the victim to seek civil redress from the accused. Further, there was a clear link between the loss suffered by the victim for which compensation was sought, and the offences committed by the accused.

16     Under these circumstances, I was of the view that a compensation order of $1100/ would be appropriate and would be consistent with the underlying objective and purpose of such orders so as to provide redress to the victim.

## Sentence

17     The accused was accordingly sentenced as follows –

18     The global sentence imposed was 5 weeks’ imprisonment. The accused was also ordered to pay compensation to the victim of a sum of $1100 and in default of payment, one week’s imprisonment.

## Post-Sentence

19     As soon as sentence was passed, the accused became somewhat agitated. He asked “_Why is the sentence so heavy?_”[^1] The court then made clear to the accused that the sentence had already been passed. The accused continued to protest. He further retorted “_It is very simple, if the DPP want to bite me, die, up to ----- okay, I’ll admit.”[^2]_ The court again went on to state that the sentence was already passed and was based on the submissions of the Prosecution and the cited precedent and the accused’s antecedents. The accused continued to disagree, even as the court was trying to convey the position that the sentence had already been passed. The accused then abruptly stated that “_I want to go and collect my blood report today.”[^3]_ This was a surprise about turn by the accused. At the same time, the court was minded to grant some time to the accused for this purpose and to therefore defer the commencement of his sentence. As the Prosecution had no objection, the court then informed the accused that his sentence would only commence the following day upon his surrender to court at 3.00 PM in the afternoon. The accused agreed to return the following day to surrender and also asked “_Can I discuss about this decision to appeal tomorrow when I come back?” [^4]_ The court confirmed that the accused could return the following day to either commence serving his sentence or appeal his sentence.

## Appeal and Stay of Execution

20     On his return to court the following day, the accused indicated he wished to appeal his sentence. As the accused has now appealed against his sentence, I have ordered a stay of execution on the sentence of imprisonment and the order of compensation.
