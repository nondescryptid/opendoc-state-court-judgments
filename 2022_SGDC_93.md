Civil Defence Act – Civil defence offences – Absence without leave

\[LawNet Editorial Note: The appeal in MA 9072/2022/01 was withdrawn on 12 May 2022.\]

6 May 2022

### District Judge Lorraine Ho:

## Introduction

1       The accused, a 21-year-old Singaporean male, was a full-time National Serviceman (“NSF”) with the Singapore Civil Defence Force (“SCDF”). From 15 March 2021 to 18 January 2022, the accused absented himself from his place of duty at the SCDF Headquarters without the authority of his superiors. The period of absence was 309 days or more than 10 months.

2       On 18 April 2022, the accused pleaded guilty to one proceeded charge for being absent without leave or AWOL during his national service period. He admitted to two remaining charges for being AWOL on 15 February 2021 as well as 25 February 2021 and consented to them being taken into consideration (“TIC”) for the purpose of sentencing. He was unrepresented.

3       I imposed a sentence of 14 weeks’ imprisonment for the proceeded charge with the sentence to take effect from 18 April 2022.

4       When asked if the accused would like to defer the serving of his sentence until after Hari Raya Puasa so that he could be with his family during the festive period, the accused declined and informed the court that he wished to commence serving sentence immediately.

5       On 22 April 2021, being dissatisfied with the sentence imposed on him, the accused filed a Notice of Appeal.

## Background facts

### The Charge

6       The proceeded charge reads as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="29.72%"><col width="70.28%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge No.</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Description of the Charge</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DCN-900040-2022</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">You, are charged that you, being a full time National Serviceman in the Singapore Civil Defence Force who was rendering continuous full-time service at the relevant time and thereby subject to the Civil Defence Act, 1986, being absent without leave, namely, by absenting yourself from your place of duty at HQ SCDF, 91 Ubi Avenue 4, Singapore, without authority, from 15 March 2021 to 18 January 2022 and you have committed an offence punishable under Section 48(1) of the said Act.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

7       Section 48(1) of the Civil Defence Act 1986 (“CDA”) requires the court to sentence an accused to a mandatory term of imprisonment not exceeding two years upon conviction of the offence. The accused was informed of the punishment prescribed by law. He understood the implication of pleading guilty to the said offence and maintained his plea.

### Statement of facts

8       The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) dated 17 April 2022 without qualification.

9       In essence, the accused was enlisted as a NSF on 9 April 2019. On 30 July 2019, he was posted to the SCDF Headquarters at 91 Ubi Avenue 4 to continue his National Service or NS duty until further notice.

10     However, the accused failed to report for his NS duty at the said location between 15 March 2021 to 18 January 2022. He was therefore AWOL from his place of duty without authority.

11     Investigations revealed that between 15 March 2021 to 18 January 2022, the accused had neither a legitimate reason nor any medical exemption to justify his absence for the period of ten months and four days.

12     On 18 March 2022, the consent from the Public Prosecutor was obtained pursuant to s 20(5) of the CDA to prosecute the accused for his offences committed under s 48(1) of the CDA accordingly.

## Antecedents

13     The accused was untraced.

## Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

14     The Prosecution orally submitted for a sentence of at least 14 weeks’ imprisonment.

15     The Prosecution submitted that the duration of custodial sentence sought was the sentencing norm based on the period of AWOL. This is between one third to half of the AWOL period for an accused who pleads guilty and is untraced.

16     Therefore, given that the period of AWOL was 309 days in the present case, the Prosecution was seeking a sentence of at least 14 weeks’ imprisonment, i.e. at least one third of the AWOL period, which is at the lower end of the sentencing norm.

## Mitigation

17     The accused orally pleaded for the court’s leniency in sentencing. This was his first offence. He wanted to plead guilty and move on with his life as soon as possible.

18     The accused explained to the court that he committed the offence because he had to support his family. His father met with a road traffic accident in December 2019. Since the accident, his father was unable to work as a taxi driver. The accused tendered the accident report, police report and medical documents from Tan Tock Seng Hospital of his father in respect of the accident.

19     I highlighted to the accused that the accident was in December 2019 and his AWOL period was more than a year later in March 2021. Moreover, the medical certificates produced by the accused showed that his father was on hospitalisation leave for only the period from 16 December to 31 December 2019. This was after his father was referred to Tan Tock Seng Hospital for an x-ray and check-up from Ang Mo Kio polyclinic and discharged on the same day. There was no other information on his father’s medical condition or that his father was unable to work subsequently as a result of the accident.

20     The accused elaborated that his father was still unable to work during the period of his AWOL and this was also during the Covid-19 pandemic. He had no choice but to work and support his family. He therefore sought for the lowest possible sentence.

## Decision on sentence

21     The issue before me was the appropriate sentences to impose on the accused for the proceeded charge.

22     Section 48 of the CDA states:

> **Absence without leave**

> 48.—(1)    Any person who is absent without leave shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or any other punishment authorised by this Act.

> (2)    For the purposes of this section, a person is absent without leave if the person —

>> (_a_)    without authority leaves his or her place of duty;

>> (_b_)    without authority is absent from his or her place of duty;

>> (_c_)    having been authorised to be absent from his or her place of duty, fails to return to his or her place of duty at the expiration of the period for which his or her absence was authorised; or

>> (_d_)    having been notified to report for duty fails to report to his or her place of duty without lawful excuse.

> (3)    It is a defence for any person charged with an offence under this section to prove that the person’s absence was a result of circumstances over which the person had no control.

23     National Service plays a vital and critical role in our country’s national security and defence. Our committed and dedicated National Servicemen or NSmen, who are deployed in the Singapore Armed Forces (“SAF”), Singapore Police Force (“SPF”) and SCDF, form a strong pillar of our Total Defence to ensure peace and prosperity for our nation.

24     As part of the Ministerial Statement on _National Service Defaulters_ made in Parliament on 16 January 2006 by the then Minister for Defence, Mr Teo Chee Hean, (Parliament No. 10, Session No. 2, Vol. No. 80, Sitting No. 15, Col. No. 2004), he highlighted the need for National Service and the three fundamental principles behind it, namely (a) fulfilling the critical need of national security and survival; (b) universality for all young Singaporean males who are fit to serve; and (c) equity for all NSmen to be treated in the same way regardless of background or status:

> …

> _Need for National Service_

> National Service was introduced 38 years ago in 1967, soon after we became independent. _National Service fulfilled a critical need -we had to defend ourselves. It was a matter of survival. As a small country with a small population, the only way we could build a force of sufficient size to defend ourselves was through conscription. It was a decision not taken lightly given the significant impact that conscription would have on every Singaporean. But there was no alternative._

> Over the past four decades, the need for National Service has been reaffirmed. With National Service, we have built up the SAF into a capable and credible force. The SAF deters aggression, protects our sovereignty and territorial integrity, and allows us to pursue our national interests without yielding to external threats or pressure. In addition, the SAF now also has to deal with a wider spectrum of threats which can derail our peace and prosperity, threats such as transnational terrorism and maritime security. The need for National Service therefore continues to be as critical as ever.

> National Service and our committed National Servicemen form the backbone of the SAF. It is not an exaggeration to say that the peace and prosperity that Singapore and Singaporeans have enjoyed over the past four decades are built upon the dedication of NSmen who have dutifully served their country. 700,000 have served. More than 300,000 are currently doing their full-time NS or are active operationally ready national servicemen being called up annually for their in-camp training and standby duties. Another 400,000 have done their duty and completed their operationally ready national service cycle. Sons now follow in the footsteps of their fathers, as a second generation of Singaporeans serves our country through National Service.

> National Service, both full-time and during operationally ready service, requires significant sacrifice on the part of our NSmen. _The sacrifice is shared by their families; and their employers bear inconveniences as well. The Government acknowledges this, and has over the years introduced initiatives to recognise the efforts and sacrifices of our NSmen. But these initiatives can never fully compensate our NSmen for their sacrifice and the effort they commit to serving the nation._

> _Principles of National Service_

> Our National Service policy is underpinned by three fundamental principles. _The first is that National Service must be for meeting a critical national need - for it requires considerable cost both to the individual and to the nation. That critical need is national security and our survival._ This is why NSmen are deployed only in the Singapore Armed Forces, the Singapore Police Force and the Singapore Civil Defence Force, where they contribute directly to the security and defence of Singapore.

> Once in a while, there are suggestions that Singaporeans should be allowed different forms of National Service. For example, a recent commentary by Ms Ong Soh Chin of _The Straits Times_ advocated a rethink of the scope of National Service. She suggested that it be extended to include other forms of non-combat service, such as in the social sector or in the arts. MINDEF does not think this is appropriate. We are clear that if we require our people to perform National Service, it must be to fulfil a critical national need. Otherwise there is insufficient reason to compel a person to serve.

> _The second fundamental principle of our National Service is universality._ All young Singaporean males who are fit to serve are conscripted. If we have a system in which some are conscripted but others are not, there will be strong feelings of unfairness which will undermine the commitment of our NSmen. This is not unique to Singapore. This was a problem that the US faced during the Vietnam War. Not everyone was conscripted. Some exploited loopholes and technicalities to avoid being drafted. There were exemptions, deferments and alternative forms of service. This affected morale and the will to fight among those who were drafted, and it also affected the American people's support for conscription and the war. MINDEF has always been very clear that National Service must be universal - all who are fit to serve National Service must serve.

> _The third fundamental principle of our National Service is equity._ Everyone has to be treated in the same way, regardless of background or status. His deployment in NS is determined by where he is most needed to meet the needs of the national defence. \[emphasis added\]

> …

25     In view of the public interest involved in National Service, it was held in the seminal High Court decision of _Lim Sin Han Andy v PP_ \[2000\] 1 SLR (R) 643 (“_Andy Lim_”) at \[17\] that NSmen must be prepared to subordinate their personal interests to the interests of the State. This was to ensure the overall effectiveness and efficiency of Singapore’s defence. At \[18\], the late Yong Pung How CJ stated:

> National Service is vital to the security of Singapore and it necessarily entails sacrifices by national servicemen and their families. In order to safeguard the security interests of the State, everyone who is required by law to do national service must obey and carry out the lawful orders given to him. _If the courts were to sympathise with the personal difficulties of every national serviceman, the overall effectiveness and efficiency of civil defence or the Singapore Armed Forces would be severely compromised. The deterrence of the individual offender, and others who might be tempted to commit the offence, is therefore necessary to advance the public interest involved_ in cases such as the present one. \[emphasis added\]

26     In _Andy Lim_, the appellant, who was a NSF in the SCDF, was told to report for his NS duty at the Jalan Bahar Camp from 19 January 1996 until 11 August 1996. He failed to report for duty at the designated place of duty from 12 August 1996 until he surrendered to the police on 21 October 1999. This was a continuous period of three years, two months and nine days. The appellant did not have a legitimate reason or any medical exemption to justify his absence.

27     The appellant pleaded guilty to the offence before the trial judge. Taking reference from the case of _PP v Chia Kok_ Hua (MA531/92/01), the trial judge sentenced the appellant to 18 months’ imprisonment, which was about half the period of his absence. The accused was untraced. On appeal, Yong CJ was of the view that in light of the relevant mitigating considerations, the public interest involved and the substantial AWOL period, the sentence imposed by the trial judge was appropriate.

28     In the case of _PP v Ahmad Zainudin Chia Bin Muhammad Zaki Chia_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 219</span> (“_Ahmad Zainudin”_), the accused was enlisted as a NSF with the SCDF on 30 May 2016. He went AWOL for 11 months and 19 days from 23 June 2016 to 12 June 2017 when he surrendered at the Civil Defence Academy. The accused pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment. This was also approximately half the period that the accused went AWOL. He was similarly untraced.

29     In the present case, I have noted that the accused’s AWOL period was slightly shorter than that in _Ahmad Zainudin_ by about one month and 15 days.

30     Additionally, based on the precedents, the indicative starting sentence for a first time AWOL offender is half of the AWOL period.

31     I now come to the personal circumstances raised by the accused where he said that he had committed the offence because his father was unable to work and he had to support his family. First, as I have informed the accused, there was no evidence before me that his father was unable to work during his AWOL period as a result of the rather minor road traffic accident in December 2019.

32     Next, even if I accepted what he has informed the court as true, in view of the national interest arising from the performance of NS obligations, personal and financial circumstances ought to carry very little or no weight in mitigation.

33     In _Andy Lim_, the accused said that he had committed the offence because he wanted to work and support his wife and child. Similarly, in _Ahmad Zainudin_, the accused said that he too needed to work to support his child. Despite that and as highlighted in _Andy Lim_, if the courts were to sympathise with the personal difficulties of every national serviceman, the operation of our National Service units like the SCDF, SAF or SPF would be critically affected or compromised.

34     Thus, even if I were empathetic towards the accused’s family circumstances and financial difficulties, the courts must take cognisance of the fact that national interest is of paramount importance and the three fundamental principles for our young male Singaporeans to serve National Service must be placed at the forefront. NSmen play an important role in our nation’s defence and they must ensure that they take their NS duties seriously so as to protect our country and families.

35     Overall, in coming to my decision on sentence, I took into consideration the mitigating factors raised by the accused including his early plea of guilt, his remorsefulness and the fact that he was a first offender. This was similar to the accused in both _Andy Lim_ and _Ahmad Zainudin_ although the accused in _Andy Lim_ could have pleaded guilty at a later stage before the trial judge instead of at the first available opportunity.

36     As such, given the circumstances of the accused’s case, I agreed with the Prosecution to impose a sentence of only one third of the AWOL period instead of half the AWOL period like in _Andy Lim_ and _Ahmad Zainudin_. I was of the view that a downward adjustment from the indicative starting sentence is apposite. Furthermore, I did not take into consideration the two TIC charges where the period of AWOL was very short at one day per charge.

37     All things considered, I was of the view that a sentence of 14 weeks’ imprisonment in the present case is appropriate. The sentence imposed on the accused, which is at the lower end of the sentencing range, could not in my view be said to be manifestly excessive.

## Conclusion

38     To summarise, the accused was accordingly sentenced as follows:
