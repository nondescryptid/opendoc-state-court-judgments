### District Judge Hamidah Bte Ibrahim:

## Introduction

The accused, a 21 year old male Vietnamese national, claimed trial to 1 charge of unlawfully remaining in Singapore for a period exceeding 90 days under section 15(1) and punishable under section 15(3)(b) of the Immigration Act, Chapter 133. On the day of the trial, after his defence counsel was discharged from acting for him upon counsel’s application, the accused decided to plead guilty. The particulars of the charge he pleaded guilty to is as follows:

> DAC-915238-2019: That without reasonable cause, the accused remained unlawfully in Singapore from 8 June 2018 to 22 May 2019, which is a period of 11 months and 15 days (349 days) after the cancellation of the visit pass on 7 June 2018.

2       The accused was sentenced to serve 8 weeks imprisonment with 3 strokes of the cane. He is now appealing against this sentence.

## The Statement of Facts (SOF)

3       The SOF which the accused admitted without any qualification is reproduced below.

4       The Accused is Ly Van Phuc 21 years old, a male Vietnam national. On 22.05.2019, the Accused was arrested by Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officers in the vicinity of Geylang Road when he could not produce any evidence to show that he was staying lawfully in Singapore. Subsequently the Accused was referred to Enforcement Division, ICA for further investigation.

5       Investigations revealed that the Accused was granted with a work permit valid from 19.12.2017 till 18.06.2018 to work as trainee undergraduate for his employer M/s Imperial Court Pte Ltd. He was also granted a Visit Pass to remain here for the duration of the said work permit.

6       The Accused was informed when he began working for his employer that if he was to run away from his employer, his work permit and Visit Pass would be cancelled.

7       Sometime in May 2018, the Accused left his employment without informing his employer who then reported him as a missing worker. As the Accused could not be traced and had not reported to his employer his whereabouts in Singapore, his work permit and Visit Pass were cancelled by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on 07.06.2018 at the request of his employer. The Accused then remained in Singapore unlawfully.

8       The Accused had, without reasonable cause, from 08.06.2018 until the time of his arrest on 22.05.2019, remained unlawfully in Singapore for a period of 11 Months and 15 Days (349 Days) and has therefore committed an offence under Section 15(1) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133), punishable under Section 15(3) (b) of the said Act

## The Sentence

9       The penalty for the offence of overstaying in Singapore for a period exceeding 90 days is imprisonment not exceeding 6 months and, subject to the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code, with caning of not less than 3 strokes of the cane. When the accused pleaded guilty to the charge he fully understood the penalty, the nature and consequence of his plea and was prepared to admit the SOF without any qualification, especially when it was stressed to him that there was a mandatory minimum of 3 strokes of the cane.

10     In their address on sentence, the prosecution tendered a table of sentencing precedents which indicated that for persons who have overstayed for a period of 11 months 6 days to 11 months and 15 days, the norm would be a sentence of 6 weeks imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane. These were cases where the accused persons had pleaded guilty. They submitted for a sentence of 8 weeks imprisonment, an uplift of 2 weeks, as the accused had abused the court process. In mitigation, the accused pleaded for the lowest sentence.

11     I agreed with the prosecution. This was not a case where the accused, a first offender, had pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity. The records showed that he was first charged on the 23 of May 2019 and released on bail forthwith. After 4 mentions, his case was first for a pre-trial conference (ptc) and on the second ptc, he decided to plead guilty and a date for him to do so was fixed on the 27 of September 2019. However, he changed his mind on the 27 of September 2019, his then counsel was discharged and a new counsel came on board with instructions from him to claim trial. The case was fixed for another ptc and the case was fixed for hearing on the 25 November, 2019

12     On the hearing date, all the prosecution witnesses were present in court and the prosecution was ready to proceed with the trial. While the accused did eventually plead guilty, I did not give his plea much weight considering that resources had already been expended in preparation for the trial. This is not to say that the accused was being penalised for wanting to claim trial but he certainly cannot be afforded the same leniency usually extended to accused persons who chose to plead guilty at the first available opportunity. There was also nothing of significance raised in his mitigation plea to warrant a lower sentence.

13     In conclusion, I sentenced the accused to serve 8 weeks imprisonment and the mandatory minimum 3 strokes of the cane. The accused is presently serving his sentence.
