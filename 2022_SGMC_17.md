### District Judge Ng Tee Tze Allen:

1       The plaintiff is the defendant’s ex-solicitor. On 29 January 2019, the defendant and her friend, Lim Jun Yih (“**Mr Lim**”), attended unannounced at the plaintiff’s office building to demand a refund of the sum of S$40,000 which the defendant had paid to him. They saw the plaintiff at the ground level and approached him to demand the refund. The plaintiff claims that the defendant defamed him during the incident and has accordingly sued.

## Facts

### The defendant paid the plaintiff S$40,000 for a possible appeal in DC/PHA 34/2016

2       As stated, the plaintiff is the defendant’s ex-solicitor. He was first engaged to act for the defendant on or around 8 September 2017 to represent her in DC/PHA 34/2016. It was agreed that she would pay him a lump sum of S$50,000 for his work in this matter.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

3       A couple of days before the decision of DC/PHA 34/2016 was released, the parties discussed the possibility of an appeal against the decision in DC/PHA 34/2016. In those discussions, the plaintiff quoted S$40,000 for the appeal. The defendant agreed. On 17 January 2018 she paid S$40,000 to the plaintiff.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2)

### No appeal was filed

4       Two days later, on 19 January 2018, the Court in DC/PHA 34/2016 granted a protection order to the defendant.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) No costs order was made.

5       There was some dispute as to whether the defendant initially wanted to appeal against the Court’s decision not to award costs, and whether the plaintiff advised her not to. But little turned on this point. It was common ground that at the end of the day, the plaintiff decided that no appeal was necessary.

### S$40,000 retained for other CDRT matters

6       It was also common ground that the plaintiff did not refund the S$40,000 despite the defendant not proceeding with the appeal. In this respect, it was not disputed that the plaintiff had told the defendant that he would retain the S$40,000 for three other matters before the Community Dispute Resolution Tribunals (the “**CDRT matters**”). It was also not disputed that legal services were rendered for the same.[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4)

7       However, the parties disagreed as to whether the plaintiff was entitled to retain the S$40,000 for this reason:

> (a)     The defendant’s case is that the S$40,000 should be returned because it was intended for the appeal in DC/PHA 34/2016 and no appeal was filed. Further and in the alternative, even if the S$40,000 was to be applied towards the work done for the CDRT matters, that proper invoices should have been issued. According to the defendant, she had asked for this on a number of occasions to no avail. She also asserted that the plaintiff shifted office without telling her which led to her conducting Google searches to locate the plaintiff’s new office.[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5)

> (b)     The plaintiff disagreed. He took the position that the S$40,000 should not be refunded because the defendant had agreed for it to be applied towards the preparatory work for the appeal in DC/PHA 34/2016 and for the work done in the CDRT matters.[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) He claimed that the defendant had not requested for the return of the S$40,000 or for interim bills until the incident of 29 January 2019.

### The defendant demands the return of the S$40,000

8       This brings us to the events of 29 January 2019. The defendant and Mr Lim had intended to meet the plaintiff at his office that day. However, they did not make a prior appointment and when they saw him at the ground floor of the office building, approached him.

9       What happened next was caught on video and transcribed. The defendant and Mr Lim asked for a refund of the S$40,000, and the plaintiff disagreed. The video showed that the defendant to be quite aggrieved. During the exchange, the plaintiff requested a number of times that they meet the next day in his office. The defendant eventually agreed, but not before she made a number of statements which the plaintiff took issue with.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7)

### The plaintiff sued the defendant for defamation

10     On 2 June 2020, the plaintiff commenced this action. On 17 February 2021, he amended his Statement of Claim. In his Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1), he set out the statements which he claimed the plaintiff made on 29 January 2019 (collectively, the “**Statements**”) which he took issue with:

> (a)      **Statement 1**: “You never do your job”[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8)

> (b)      **Statement 2**: “You want to earn money ok you must earn you, \[followed by 5 Mandarin words\].”

> According to the plaintiff, Mr Lim had translated the defendant’s statement to the plaintiff in the following terms “What she said was even though you want to earn money right you must earn ethically in a way.”[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9)

> (c)      **Statement 3**: “I don’t want to find trouble lah, ok hoh. You already charge me very high legal fee already. Please return me the $40,000.00 enough… Now I go and see ASP Leong see what to do like that.”[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10)

> (d)      **Statement 4**: “As a lawyer you must know how to fight”[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11)

11     One final point should be noted of the plaintiff’s case. Even though this was a case involving slander, he did not seek to allege or prove special damages. Instead, he relied on exception set out in s 5 of the Defamation Act (Cap 75)(2014 Rev Ed) (the “**Act**”) arguing that the Statements were “calculated to … disparage \[him\] in his … profession as an Advocate & Solicitor.”[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12)

12     In her Defence (Amendment No 1), the defendant pleaded that the Statements were not defamatory, [\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13) and in any event, were not heard by third parties.[^14] She also denied that the Statements were calculated to disparage the plaintiff in his profession and pleaded that the defences of justification and fair comment applied.[^15]

## Issues

13     In the circumstances, I will proceed as follows. I will start by determining whether the plaintiff had proved a _prima facie_ case of actionable slander. To that end, I will determine:

> (a)     whether the Statements were defamatory and if they referred to the plaintiff;

> (b)     whether the Statements were published; and

> (c)     whether the Statements were calculated to disparage the plaintiff in his profession to attract the application of s 5 of the Act.

14     I will then determine whether the defendant had established her defences for the Statement(s) in which a _prima facie_ case of actionable slander is established. As noted, the defendant has raised the defences of justification and fair comment.

15     Finally, I will determine the quantum of damages (if any) to be awarded.

## Whether the plaintiff established a prima facie case of actionable slander

### The law

16     The law was not in dispute. To establish a _prima facie_ case of defamation, a claimant must prove three elements:

> (a)     First, that the statement is defamatory in nature. This element would be established if the statement lowers the claimant in the estimation of right-thinking members of the society generally or ordinary reasonable people: Gary Chan Kok Yew, _The Law of Torts in Singapore_ (Academy Publishing)(2nd Ed, 2016) at \[12.015\]. In this respect, it is trite that a person may be defamed in respect of his office, profession, calling, trade or business: Clerk & Lindsell on Torts (22 Ed, 2018) at \[22-47\].

> (b)     Second, that the statement refers to the claimant. This element would be established if a third party would reasonably understand the statement to refer to the claimant: Gary Chan Kok Yew, _The Law of Torts in Singapore_ (Academy Publishing)(2nd Ed, 2016) at \[12.054\]

> (c)     Third, that the statement was published. This element would be established if the statement has been communicated to at least one person other than the plaintiff who would reasonably understand the statement to be defamatory to the plaintiff: Gary Chan Kok Yew, _The Law of Torts in Singapore_ (Academy Publishing)(2nd Ed, 2016) at \[12.069\].

17     Where a matter concerns slander, the claimant would ordinarily need to allege and prove special damages for it to be actionable. Alternatively, he may seek to rely on an exception: _Goh Chok Tong v Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 3 SLR(R) 46</span> at \[35\]; Gary Chan Kok Yew, _The Law of Torts in Singapore_ (Academy Publishing)(2nd Ed, 2016) at \[12.006\]. In the present case, the plaintiff sought to rely on the exception set out in s 5 of the Act:

> Slander affecting official, professional or business reputation

> 5.    In an action for slander in respect of **words calculated to disparage the plaintiff in any** office, **profession**, calling, trade or business held or carried on by him at the time of the publication, it shall not be necessary to allege or prove special damage whether or not the words are spoken of the plaintiff in the way of his office, profession, calling, trade or business.

> (emphasis in bold)

18     In this regard, the phrase “calculated to” has been interpreted to mean “likely to produce the result_”: DHKW Marketing and another v Nature’s Farm Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 774</span> at \[39\]; _Low Tuck Kwong v Sukamto Sia_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 1 SLR 639</span> at \[112\]. Applied to the facts of our case, the plaintiff had to prove that the Statements were likely to disparage him in his profession as a solicitor and advocate to rely on s 5 of the Act.

### Statement 1

#### Whether Statement 1 was defamatory and referred to the plaintiff

19     Statement 1 was “you never do your job”.

20     The plaintiff submitted that Statement 1 meant that the plaintiff was lazy, has a lackadaisical attitude and was not a good worker, and that the above statements were published because they were shouted in front of a Malay man.[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16)

21     I accept that the Statement 1 was defamatory and that it did refer to the plaintiff. This is clear from the plain reading of Statement 1. Furthermore, a third party listening to this exchange would have also heard the defendant’s reasons for alleging that the plaintiff did not fight for her. The relevant part of the transcript is reproduced below:[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17)

> 
| 

Defendant:

 | 

I don’t want to talk too much, count too much with you okay. Fifty thousand plus plus plus again the lawyer fee for the POHA okay, you never. **I know, we know, you never try your best to fight for me you know Like Shawn Loo show the video okay, I and my husband come up, haven’t touch the dustbin, why you never fight for me? Fight for me la okay?**

 |
| 

Plaintiff:

 | 

For what? Now only you tell me all these things, you should’ve told me a while ago.

 |
| 

Defendant:

 | 

No, this one can see **you never do your job.**

 |
| 

(emphasis in bold)

 |

  
  

#### Whether Statement 1 was published

22     However, I did not agree that Statement 1 was published to third parties, and in particular, the Malay man that the plaintiff identified. The video evidence showed that the Malay man was speaking to another man whilst smoking when Statement 1 was said.[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18) Neither appeared to be paying attention to the parties’ conversation.

#### Whether s 5 of the Act applied to Statement 1

23     Given the matters at \[22\] there was no need to determine this point. However, I will state for completeness that I would have found that s 5 of the Act applied assuming Statement 1 was published. Statement 1 was a comment on how the plaintiff failed to do his job competently (see \[21\] above) and was as such likely to disparage the plaintiff in his profession as an advocate and solicitor.

24     In any event, for the reasons at \[22\], the plaintiff’s claim in relation to Statement 1 is dismissed.

### Statement 2

#### Whether Statement 2 was defamatory and referred to the plaintiff

25     The next statement that the plaintiff took issue with (i.e. Statement 2) was made in a mix of English and Mandarin. It could be heard from the video evidence, and it was translated in the transcript annexed to defendant’s AIEC. The translated version of Statement 2 is reproduced below. The translated words which were originally said in Mandarin is underlined:

> Defendant:    You want to earn money, ok. You must earn you, How do you say conscience? How do you say that?

26     As neither party asserted that the above translation / transcription was inaccurate, I proceed on the basis that it reflected Statement 2 accurately.

27     The plaintiff pleaded the Statement 2 was defamatory because it implied that he “has/was earning his money as an Advocate & Solicitor in an unethical and dishonest way”.[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19)

28     The defendant made a bare denial that Statement 2 was defamatory in her Defence (Amendment No.1). No alternative interpretation was offered.[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20) This remained the same in her closing submissions, where she argued that the plaintiff “has not established that she did not specify the person she was talking about”.[^21]

29     I was prepared to find that Statement 2 was defamatory because it implied that the plaintiff was earning money in an unethical manner. In my judgment, it would have been clear to a third party who understood Mandarin and who heard Statement 2 that the defendant wanted to say that the plaintiff must earn money in a conscionable manner (or to use the words of the plaintiff, unethically). This would have led the third party to understand that the defendant was implying that the plaintiff was earning money in an unconscionable manner.:[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22)

> (a)     First, the video evidence showed that only 3 persons were in this conversation—the plaintiff, the defendant, and her friend, Mr Lim. And immediately after stating “You want to earn money, ok. You must earn”, the defendant asked in Mandarin “How do you say conscience? How do you say that?”_[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23)_ Quite clearly, it was only because the plaintiff could not find the English words to that effect that she stopped halfway to ask in Mandarin “How do you say conscience? How do you say that?”

> (b)     In this respect, given that the plaintiff was Indian and Mr Lim was Chinese, the natural inference drawn would have been that the question was addressed to Mr Lim.

> (c)     Further, any doubts haboured would have been dispelled when Mr Lim explained to the plaintiff what the defendant meant:[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24)

>> Mr Lim:    So she say if you want to earn money should do it ethically in a way.”

30     That said, I did not think that it could be fairly implied from Statement 2 that the plaintiff was earning money dishonestly. I accept that dishonesty is one way that a person can earn money unconscionably/unethically. But it is not the only way and in my judgment the defendant had said nothing in the stairway which indicated the dishonesty.

#### Whether Statement 2 was published

31     I find also that the Statement 2 was published to Mr Lim SG and his wife (the “**couple**”). It was common ground that the couple were in the stairway with the plaintiff, defendant and Mr Lim, and that they were in close proximity. The video also showed that the plaintiff was aggrieved and as such, was not keeping her volume down. Under these circumstances, it would have been surprising if the couple had not heard Statement 2.[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25)

#### Whether s 5 of the Act applied to Statement 2

32     I find that s 5 of the Act applied to Statement 2. For the reasons at \[29\] above, Statement 2 impugned the plaintiff’s professional ethics by implying that he was earning money in an unconscionable/unethical manner. Such a statement is likely to disparage the plaintiff in his profession.

33     For the reasons above, I find that the plaintiff had established a _prima facie case_ of actionable slander for Statement 2.

### Statement 3

#### Whether Statement 3 was defamatory and referred to the plaintiff

34     The third statement (i.e. Statement 3) that the plaintiff took issue with are reproduced (bolded) below:[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26)

> 
| 

Defendant:

 | 

**I don’t want to find trouble lah, ok hoh. You already charge me very high legal fee already. Please return me the $40,000.00 enough.**

 |
| 

Plaintiff:

 | 

No la, where got.

 |
| 

Defendant:

 | 

This, because, this forty thousand is for appeal, for appeal.

 |
| 

Plaintiff:

 | 

I don’t have a single cent in me, I show you, tomorrow, I show you. I don’t have a single cent with me all…

 |
| 

Defendant:

 | 

We talk is for appeal leh ok

 |
| 

Plaintiff:

 | 

tomorrow eleven o’ clock

 |
| 

Defendant:

 | 

but we never go to appeal, how come you charge me forty thousand. **Nevermind, I go and see ASP Leong first. See what to do like that** because ASP Leong tell me you also hear what. No need to fight to court already.

 |
| 

Plaintiff:

 | 

The ASP all cannot do anything.

 |
| 

Defendant:

 | 

And then this one ah, this one ah you go to take back from the lawyer. You never appeal should be take back ok.

 |
| 

(emphasis in bold)

 |

  
  

35     The plaintiff’s pleaded case was that Statement 3 meant that he was overcharging the defendant and that the defendant would be seeing a high-ranking police officer to investigate the same.[\[note: 27\]](#Ftn_27)

36     I did not think that the plaintiff proved his pleaded case. As the defendant submitted, just because a lawyer charges his client a “high legal fee”, that does not necessarily imply that he had overcharged his client.[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28) Moreover, when understood in its proper context, the defendant was not referring to the S$40,000 when she said “very high legal fee”. Rather, she was referring to the S$50,000 which she had paid the plaintiff for his work before the court of first instance in DC/PHA 34/2016 (see \[2\] above). And in respect of this S$50,000, while she of the view she was paying a premium,[^29] it was clear that she was not seeking a refund of same even during the incident of 29 January 2019. Thus, minutes before making Statement 3, the defendant stated:[^30]

> Defendant:    I never say I want to take back fifty thousand from you. I just want to take back the money for appeal because I never go to appeal state.

#### Whether Statement 3 was published

37     I was also not prepared to find that the words were published to the Indian man. From Video 2, the Indian man walked pass the plaintiff, the defendant and Mr Lim at time stamp 03:53 before the Statement 3 was said at timestamp 04:00 to 04:30.

38     In this respect, I did not think that the evidence supported the plaintiff’s submissions that the Indian man “would have heard every word that the defendant uttered” whilst he walked to the staircase.[\[note: 31\]](#Ftn_31) As the plaintiff himself stated, the Indian man was holding his phone close to his ear.[^32] This indicated to me that the Indian man was on the phone. In any event, it appeared from the footage that the Indian man was not interested in the parties’ conversation.

#### Whether s 5 of the Act applied to Statement 3

39     Given my findings above, I did not think that the plaintiff established that s 5 of the Act applied to Statement 3.

40     The Plaintiff’s claim in relation to Statement 3 is dismissed.

### Statement 4

#### Whether Statement 4 was defamatory and if it referred to the plaintiff

41     Finally, the plaintiff complained that the defendant’s words “As a lawyer **_you_** must know how to fight” (i.e. Statement 4) meant that he was meek in his professional work as a lawyer and that he was not able to represent the interest of his clients.[\[note: 33\]](#Ftn_33)

42     First and foremost, the defendant’s actual words were “As a lawyer must know how to fight”. The word “you” was not used.

43     Notwithstanding, I was of the view that a third party who witnessed the exchange would have known that the defendant was addressing the plaintiff when she made Statement 4. This was clear from the video evidence. I accept also that Statement 4 was defamatory because it indicated that the plaintiff did not know how to fight like a lawyer despite being one.

#### Whether Statement 4 was published

44     That said, I was unable to find that these words were published to the 2 male Chinese tenants and the one female tenant (collectively, the “**Chinese tenants**”). The plaintiff referred me to the second video at time stamp 06:35 to 06:51 in support of his case.

45     During this period, the Chinese tenants were seen walking pass at 06:35-06:46. However, the offending words would not be heard until some 16 seconds later at timestamp 7:02. In this respect, it was not the plaintiff’s case that the Chinese tenants had stood off camera to listen to the conversation. Indeed, the evidence did not support such a finding—the three Chinese tenants also did not appear interested in the parties’ conversation.

#### Whether s 5 of the Act applied to Statement 4

46     For the reasons at \[44\]-\[45\] (above), the plaintiff’s claim in respect of Statement 4 is dismissed. As such, there is no need to determine whether s 5 of the Act applied. For completeness, however, I will state that I would have found that s 5 of the Act applied assuming Statement 4 was published. Indeed, as explained at \[43\] (above), Statement 4 meant that the plaintiff did not know how to fight like a lawyer. It impugned his professional competency and as such, was likely to disparage the plaintiff in his profession.

## Defences

47     For the reasons above, I had found that the plaintiff had established a _prima facie_ case of actionable slander for the Statement 2. I turn to consider whether the defendant established a defence for it.

### Justification

48     I start with the defence of justification. To succeed, the defendant had to prove the truth of the substance or gist of the statement. For ease of reference, I reproduce Statement 2 with the translation of the original Mandarin words underlined:

> You want to earn money, ok. You must earn you, How do you say conscience? How do you say that?

49     As stated at \[27\]-\[29\], I was of the view that Statement 2 implied that the plaintiff was earning money in an unconscionable (or to use the words of the plaintiff, unethical) manner.

50     In this respect, the crux of the defendant’s defence was that the plaintiff had acted unethically because the plaintiff did not: (a) return her S$40,000 which she had paid for the appeal in DC/PHA 34/2016 which did not proceed, or (b) issue bills for the work done in the CDRT matters.[\[note: 34\]](#Ftn_34)

#### Whether it was unethical of the plaintiff to retain the S$40,000

51     I start with the question of whether it was unethical of the plaintiff to retain the S$40,000.

52     I accept that the S$40,000 was initially paid for the possible appeal in DC/PHA 34/2016. I was also prepared to accept that the defendant had initially requested for the return of the S$40,000 after she decided not to proceed with the appeal.

53     However, that was not the end of the story. In her Defence Amendment (No.1), the defendant pleaded that the plaintiff told her that as she was contemplating commencing CDRT proceedings against her other neighbors, and he would apply the S$40,000 deposit to the same.[\[note: 35\]](#Ftn_35)

54     It was also clear from the defendant’s evidence that she did not object to plaintiff’s proposal. When I sought to clarify what the defendant meant when she testified that the plaintiff had “glossed over the issue” when she asked for the return of the S$40,000, the defendant stated that “she followed what he \[i.e. the plaintiff\] said and adhered with what he said about representing \[her\] in the CDRT matters”:[\[note: 36\]](#Ftn_36)

> 
| 

Court:

 | 

Just a moment. You mentioned that Mr. Kana “glossed over the issue” when you asked for the $40,000 back. So, to the best of your recollection, what---what did he say?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

I recall after the case was concluded, the 3 of us, me, Mr. Eric and Melissa, spoke to Mr. Kana directly to ask a return for---of the appeal money first. For the CDRT cases, whatever the cost will be, we’ll review it later on. He mentioned that he will still be representing me in the CDRT matters but it was ultimately only until I commenced the CDRT proceeding then did I realise that legal representation was not permitted. **If I had known from the onset that legal representation was not allowed in CDRT I would not have followed what he said and adhered with what he said about representing me in the CDRT matters because I really didn’t have any idea. The $40,000 were kept in his pocket** and in the invoice the items were overly inflated, and I have evidence to show for that.

 |

  
  

55     Having allowed the plaintiff to retain the S$40,000 initially, the question then is whether there was any reason why the plaintiff should have returned it thereafter. The defendant’s pleaded case was that such a reason existed because she had asked for the return of the S$40,000 on multiple occasions.[\[note: 37\]](#Ftn_37)

56     I was unable to make such a finding for two reasons:

> (a)     First, there was no documentary evidence (e.g. emails, whatsapp messages) prior to 29 January 2019 demanding the return of the S$40,000 or invoices for work done. This was curious especially if the defendant took the view at that point that the plaintiff was “glossing over the issue”. Indeed, it was clear that the defendant had the plaintiff’s handphone number and that she had messaged him on more than one occasion.

> (b)     More importantly, there was some evidence that the defendant had chosen not to demand the return of the S$40,000 because she wanted to resolve the outstanding legal matters first. Thus, in her AEIC, the defendant had annexed a transcript of her meeting with the plaintiff on 30 January 2019 which recorded the following exchange:[\[note: 38\]](#Ftn_38)

> 
| 

Plaintiff:

 | 

Then why you never make noise? Give me back my forty thousand.

 |
| 

Defendant:

 | 

Uh

 |
| 

Plaintiff:

 | 

Why you never make noise?

 |
| 

Defendant:

 | 

**Because my thing never settle!**

 |
| 

Plaintiff:

 | 

You see, you see from the time…

 |
| 

Defendant:

 | 

My thing haven’t settle! OK!

 |
| 

Plaintiff:

 | 

From the time she pay forty thousand, from the time she pay on 17th of January, until yesterday, she never make noise you know? The forty thousand…

 |
| 

Mr Lim:

 | 

It is not never make noise. It is not never make noise.

 |
| 

Defendant:

 | 

Wrong already.

 |
| 

Plaintiff:

 | 

You must ask me.

 |
| 

Defendant:

 | 

My thing haven’t settle, I very headache about this one. I go and see doctor…

 |
| 

Mr Lim:

**No, it is not haven’t settle, it is because the thing is dangling over there until we decide to solve our problem first ah, don’t go and look for you. Because we trust you that you won’t cheat the money, this is, this is, this is …**

Plaintiff:

No, I am not cheating any money.

Mr Lim:

Ya correct.

57     For these reasons, I was unable to find that the plaintiff was unethical for not returning the S$40,000 prior to 29 January 2019.

#### Whether it was unethical of the plaintiff not to render interim bills

58     I turn to the issue of whether it was unethical of the plaintiff not to render interim bills prior to 29 January 2019.

59     There was no evidence of the defendant requesting interim bills. As such, the question was whether the plaintiff had an independent ethical obligation to do so.

60     In this respect, the defendant relied on Rule 17(3)(b) of the Legal Professional (Professional Conduct Rules) 2015. However, that provision does not impose a duty to bill a client in stages. It only imposes the duty on the solicitor to **_inform_** his client of any reasonable other foreseeable payments that the client may have to make and of the stages those payments are likely to proceed:

> (3) A legal practitioner must —

>> (a)    …

>> (b)     **inform** the client of any other reasonably foreseeable payments that the client may have to make, either to the legal practitioner or to any other party, and of the stages at which those payments are likely to be require

> (emphasis in bold)

61     Under these circumstances, I was unable to find that the defendant proved that the plaintiff had such an ethical obligation to issue interim bills for the CDRT matters.

62     For the avoidance of doubt, my judgment above is limited only to the allegations raised by the defendant to support her defence of justification. To the extent that there may be instances of misconduct that were not pleaded and/or relied upon in her submissions, I make no comment on the same. In particular, I am not determining whether or not the plaintiff had failed to inform the defendant of the matters set out in Rule 17(3)(b) of the Legal Professional (Professional Conduct Rules) 2015. The point was not put to the plaintiff, and it was not an argument advanced by the defendant. Similarly, I am also not determining whether the plaintiff had overcharged the defendant. Again, this was not a point raised by the defendant in her pleadings or submissions. Further, the defendant has obtained an order for the taxation of 3 of the plaintiff’s bills.[\[note: 39\]](#Ftn_39) This taxation is not before me and I do not intend to prejudge the point.

### Fair comment

63     I turn to the defence of fair comment. To succeed, the words complained of must be comments based on facts and which a fair-minded person can honestly make on the facts provided. The comment must also be of public interest.

64     The defendant referred me to _Aaron Anne Joseph v Cheong Yip Seng_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 1 SLR(R) 258</span> (_“_**_Aaron Anne_**_”)_ for the proposition that public interest includes any matter affecting people at large so that they may be legitimately interested in what is going on or how they might be affected.[^40] In that case, the Court of Appeal found that the comments made were of legitimate public interest as it concerned a religious sect and church matters have been held to be of legitimate public interest.

65     In the present case, however, it was difficult to see how the Statement 2 affected people at large such that they may be legitimately interested. Statement 2 quite clearly concerned the private relationship between a solicitor (i.e. the plaintiff) and his client (i.e. the defendant).

66     For the avoidance of doubt, I am not saying that the defence of fair comment is not available to private businesses. Indeed, there is authority that where the business is sufficiently large, and the matter relates to a sufficiently large number of people, the defence certainly can apply: see Clerk & Lindsell on Torts (22 Ed, 2018) at \[22-168\]. However, the present case was not of that nature. The underlying dispute between the parties concerned only the work which the plaintiff did for the defendant, and the way he was seeking to charged her for it. No evidence was led to show why this would affect people at large or why they should be legitimately interested in the same.

67     For these reasons, the defence of fair comment was not made out.

## Quantum of damages

68     There are two elements of damages that concern us: general damages and aggravated damages. General damages serve three functions. They act as a consolation for the distressed suffered from the publication of the statement; they repair the harm to his reputation; and they serve to vindicate his reputation: _Lim Eng Hock Peter v Lin Jian Wei_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 4 SLR 357</span> at \[3\]-\[6\]; _Lee Hsien Loong v Leong Sze Hian_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 4 SLR 1128</span> at \[84\]. Aggravated damages are awarded when the defendant’s conduct aggravated the hurt to the plaintiff’s feelings.

69     In determining the quantum to be awarded, the following factors are relevant:

> (a)     the nature and gravity of the defamation;

> (b)     the conduct, position and standing of the plaintiff and the defendant;

> (c)     the mode and extent of publication;

> (d)     the natural indignation of the Court at the injury caused to the plaintiff;

> (e)     the conduct of the defendant from the time the defamatory statement is published to the very moment of the verdict;

> (f)     the failure to apologise and retract the defamatory statement; and

> (g)     the presence of malice.

> _Lim Eng Hock Peter v Lin Jian Wei_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 4 SLR 357</span> at \[7\]; _Lee Hsien Loong v Leong Sze Hian_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 66</span> at \[85\].

70     In the present case, both parties referred me to the case of _Andrew John Hanam v Carolyn Tan Beng Hui_ (unreported) (“**_Andrew John Hanam_**”). However, they reached different conclusions as to how much damages should be awarded. The plaintiff quantified his damages at general damages of S$10,000 and aggravated damages of S$10,000 on the basis he succeeded on all four Statements.[\[note: 41\]](#Ftn_41) In contrast, the defendant submitted that any general damages should not exceed S$2,000 and aggravated damages should not exceed S$2,000.[^42]

71     Given the different conclusions reached despite referring to the same case, I start by considering _Andrew John Hanam. Andrew John Hanam_ is an unreported decision summarized in Salina Ishak & Clement Julien Tan, _Practitioners’ Guide on Damages Awarded for Defamation Cases in Singapore_ (Singapore Academy of Law Journal) at p.115-117. In that case, two solicitors, Mr Hanam and Ms Tan, attended at the State Courts for a garnishee hearing. Mr Hanam acted for the judgment creditor and Ms Tan acted for the garnishee. Mr Hanam was speaking to the defendant in the action along the corridor outside the Civil Registry. Ms Tan wanted to be part of the conversation but Mr Hanam told her that this was a private conversation. Ms Tan then pointed to Mr Hanam and said in a loud voice “Do you know that this lawyer was struck off?”.

72     On these facts, the Court found Ms Tan liable and awarded S$10,000 as general damages. In respect of aggravated damages, the Court found that aggravation took the form of Ms Tan’s assertion that Mr Hanam did not have a reputation worthy of the word, which she maintained in cross-examination and in closing submissions.

73     In the present case, I agree that there were similarities between the present case and _Andrew John Hanam._ First, the plaintiffs in both cases were lawyers and they were slandered in their professional capacity. Second, the defendants in both cases have not apologized or retracted their defamatory statements. And third, the defendants in both cases sought to rely on the defence of justification unsuccessfully.

74     However, there were differences.

75     Unlike the encounter in _Andrew John Hanam_ which appeared to be rather short, the plaintiff in the present case followed the defendant from the ground floor of his building to the basement. This I accept would have increased the distress which the plaintiff felt, and perhaps merited an uplift in damages.

76     However, the defamatory statement in _Andrew John Hanam_ was more serious than the present case. In _Andrew John Hanam_, Ms Tan had alleged that Mr Hanam was struck off the rolls. In the present case, however, the plaintiff had only succeeded in his action in respect of Statement 2 which implied that he had acted unethically. Now, while I do not intend to downplay the distress suffered by the plaintiff, alleging that a lawyer was struck off the rolls is quite clearly more serious than simply alleging he was unethical. The latter encompasses a wide range of misconduct and attracts a range of sanctions. By contrast, being struck off the rolls means that the lawyer in question has been found guilty of misconduct of the most severe nature.

77     Furthermore, unlike Ms Tan in _Andrew John Hanam_ who intended to defame the Mr Hanam to a third party, I did not think that this was the defendant’s aim in the present case. In my view, the defendant was not seeking to defame the plaintiff. Rather, she was genuinely aggrieved and this led to her comments on 29 January 2019.

78     Next, unlike Ms Tan in _Andrew John Hanam_ who added insult to injury by asserting during trial that Mr Hanam did not have a reputation worthy of the word, the defendant in the present case did no such thing in the trial before me.

79     For the reasons above, I was of the view that the general and aggravated damages to be awarded in this case should be less than that in _Andrew John Hanam._ Bearing the factors above in mind, and the fact that the plaintiff was seeking S$10,000 in general damages and S$10,000 in aggravated damages for four alleged defamatory Statements when he succeeded in only one, I award S$4,000 in general damages and S$4,000 in aggravated damages to the plaintiff

## Conclusion

80     Judgment is entered for the plaintiff in the sum of S$8,000 (being S$4,000 in general damages and S$4,000 in aggravated damages).

81     Costs to be agreed or fixed. If parties are unable to agree on costs, they are to write in with their proposed timelines for written submissions on costs. I shall give the necessary directions thereafter.
